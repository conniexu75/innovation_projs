https://openalex.org/W2038208040,"Transcriptional activation of a gene involves an orchestrated recruitment of components of the basal transcription machinery and intermediate factors, concomitant with an alteration in local chromatin structure generated by posttranslational modifications of histone tails and nucleosome remodeling. We provide here a comprehensive picture of events resulting in transcriptional activation of a gene, through evaluating the estrogen receptor-α (NR3A1) target pS2 gene promoter in MCF-7 cells. This description integrates chromatin remodeling with a kinetic evaluation of cyclical networks of association of 46 transcription factors with the promoter, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. We define the concept of a “transcriptional clock” that directs and achieves the sequential and combinatorial assembly of a transcriptionally productive complex on a promoter. Furthermore, the unanticipated findings of key roles for histone deacetylases and nucleosome-remodeling complexes in limiting transcription implies that transcriptional activation is a cyclical process that requires both activating and repressive epigenetic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2090926709,"The efficient clearance of cytotoxic misfolded protein aggregates is critical for cell survival. Misfolded protein aggregates are transported and removed from the cytoplasm by dynein motors via the microtubule network to a novel organelle termed the aggresome where they are processed. However, the means by which dynein motors recognize misfolded protein cargo, and the cellular factors that regulate aggresome formation, remain unknown. We have discovered that HDAC6, a microtubule-associated deacetylase, is a component of the aggresome. We demonstrate that HDAC6 has the capacity to bind both polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins and dynein motors, thereby acting to recruit misfolded protein cargo to dynein motors for transport to aggresomes. Indeed, cells deficient in HDAC6 fail to clear misfolded protein aggregates from the cytoplasm, cannot form aggresomes properly, and are hypersensitive to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. These findings identify HDAC6 as a crucial player in the cellular management of misfolded protein-induced stress."

Based on the finding that a soluble form of mesothelin specifically binds to ovarian carcinoma cell line OVCAR-3, we isolated cDNAs encoding a mesothelin-binding protein by expression cloning. The polypeptides encoded by the two cloned cDNA fragments matched to portions of CA125, an ovarian cancer antigen and a giant mucin-like glycoprotein present at the surface of tumor cells. By flow cytometric analysis and immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that CA125 binds to mesothelin in a specific manner. Binding of CA125 to membrane-bound mesothelin mediates heterotypic cell adhesion as anti-mesothelin antibody blocks binding of OVCAR-3 cells expressing CA125 to an endothelial-like cell line expressing mesothelin. Finally, we show that CA125 and mesothelin are co-expressed in advanced grade ovarian adenocarcinoma. Taken together, our data indicate that mesothelin is a novel CA125-binding protein and that CA125 might contribute to the metastasis of ovarian cancer to the peritoneum by initiating cell attachment to the mesothelial epithelium via binding to mesothelin.

CA125 is a tumor antigen originally defined by the monoclonal antibody OC125 (1Bast Jr., R.C. Klug T.L. St John E. Jenison E. Niloff J.M. Lazarus H. Berkowitz R.S. Leavitt T. Griffiths C.T. Parker L. Zurawski Jr., V.R. Knapp R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar) that is routinely used for diagnosis of ovarian cancer and to monitor the recurrence after therapy (2Peters III, W.A. Bagley C.M. Smith M.R. Cancer. 1986; 58: 2625-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Bon G.G. Kenemans P. Verstraeten R. van Kamp G.J. Hilgers J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1996; 174: 107-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CA125 is expressed on the cell surface, and, in addition, soluble proteolytic fragments are also released into the extracellular space. The primary structure of CA125 was established recently, indicating that it is a type I transmembrane protein with a short intracellular and a giant extracellular domain, the latter with 22,097 amino acid residues. The extracellular part is composed of an amino-terminal part spanning 12,070 residues (4O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Shigemasa K. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), followed by more than 60 tandem repeats of a 156-amino acid motif and a 229-residue linker to the transmembrane domain (5O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Both the amino-terminal part and the repeat domains are rich in serine and threonine residues and are highly glycosylated. The carbohydrate content was estimated to be 24–28%, with O-linked and N-linked glycans (6Kui Wong N. Easton R.L. Panico M. Sutton-Smith M. Morrison J.C. Lattanzio F.A. Morris H.R. Clark G.F. Dell A. Patankar M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28619-28634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because highly O-glycosylated repeats are the landmark of the mucin family of glycoproteins, CA125 was also named MUC16 (7Yin B.W. Lloyd K.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27371-27375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The mucin-like repeats contain homology to the so-called SEA module, a domain that was reported to be susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and subsequent self-association (8Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J. Smorodinsky N. Keydar I. Neophytou P. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Gordon S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An additional potential proteolytic cleavage site in CA125 was reported to be located immediately membrane-proximal (5O'Brien T.J. Beard J.B. Underwood L.J. Dennis R.A. Santin A.D. York L. Tumour Biol. 2001; 22: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although the structure of CA125 has been elucidated, a functional role for this molecule in the physiological context or in cancer remains unknown. However, a number of publications have pointed out several properties of CA125 that may be of relevance for its biological function. First, because of its expression in embryonic membranes and adult derivatives of the fetal periderm, CA125 has been suggested to play role as a lubricant, preventing adhesion of membranes (9Hardardottir H. Parmley II, T.H. Quirk Jr., J.G. Sanders M.M. Miller F.C. O'Brien T.J. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1990; 163: 1925-1931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Anti-adhesive properties have also been assigned to branched O-glycans on leucosialin/CD43 and other mucins (10Fukuda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 394-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, CA125 protein coated on plastic culture dishes interferes with the attachment of a variety of cell lines to the plastic dishes (11Gaetje R. Winnekendonk D.W. Ahr A. Kaufmann M. Clin. Exp. Obstet. Gynecol. 2002; 29: 34-36PubMed Google Scholar). Second, close analysis of the glycans present on CA125 revealed the presence of several glycan structures that have been implicated in immune suppression (6Kui Wong N. Easton R.L. Panico M. Sutton-Smith M. Morrison J.C. Lattanzio F.A. Morris H.R. Clark G.F. Dell A. Patankar M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28619-28634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that CA125 might help protect the embryo from maternal immune rejection and play an immunoevasive role in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, mucins can bind to various sugar-binding molecules, such as selectins (12Kim Y.J. Borsig L. Han H.L. Varki N.M. Varki A. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 461-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Wahrenbrock M. Borsig L. Le D. Varki N. Varki A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and galectins (14Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, galectin-1 was recently shown to bind to CA125 specifically (15Seelenmeyer C. Wegehingel S. Lechner J. Nickel W. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Finally, in an in vitro Matrigel invasion assay, CA125 from human peritoneal fluid was shown to enhance the invasiveness of a benign endometriotic cell line, EEC 145, but it did not affect the invasiveness of a variety of non-endometrioid cell lines (16Gaetje R. Winnekendonk D.W. Scharl A. Kaufmann M. J. Soc. Gynecol. Investig. 1999; 6: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that CA125 plays a role in endometriosis. However, this study did not address the question of how soluble CA125 might bind to EEC145 cells to exert this bioactivity. Taken together, recent evidence suggests that CA125 may exert a number of different functions in parallel. Some of these functions may be mediated by specific molecular interactions, others by the physical properties of this huge, glycosylated molecule. Interestingly, several other mucins have been implicated in invasion and metastasis of cancer, partly because of similar functions. For example, MUC1 induces T cell apoptosis (17Gimmi C.D. Morrison B.W. Mainprice B.A. Gribben J.G. Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Park S.Y. Watanabe M. Gong J. Hayes D.F. Kufe D.W. Nadler L.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1367-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and increases invasiveness (18Satoh S. Hinoda Y. Hayashi T. Burdick M.D. Imai K. Hollingsworth M.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), MUC18 has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis (19Sers C. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5689-5694PubMed Google Scholar), MUC2 enhances colon cancer metastasis to the liver (20Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C. Yunker C.K. Dudas S. Hoon V.K. Bresalier R.S. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 363-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although it appears to inhibit initial neoplasia as MUC2-deficient mice develop colorectal cancer (21Velcich A. Yang W. Heyer J. Fragale A. Nicholas C. Viani S. Kucherlapati R. Lipkin M. Yang K. Augenlicht L. Science. 2002; 295: 1726-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar), MUC8 is up-regulated in metastatic medulloblastoma (22MacDonald T.J. Brown K.M. LaFleur B. Peterson K. Lawlor C. Chen Y. Packer R.J. Cogen P. Stephan D.A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and MUC3B is up-regulated in intestinal metaplasia (23Boussioutas A. Li H. Liu J. Waring P. Lade S. Holloway A.J. Taupin D. Gorringe K. Haviv I. Desmond P.V. Bowtell D.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2569-2577PubMed Google Scholar). Mesothelin is another tumor antigen that was originally identified by the antibody CAK-1 on mesothelial cells, mesotheliomas, and ovarian cancers (24Chang K. Pastan I. Willingham M.C. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 50: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 25Chang K. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). It is a secreted protein anchored at the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; MPF, megakaryocyte potentiating factor; OVCAR-3, NIH:OVCAR-3; RPMI, RPMI medium 1640; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HUVEC, human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells; EST, expressed sequence tag; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SAGE, serial analysis of gene expression; r, Pearson correlation coefficient; WFDC2, whey acidic protein four-disulfide core domain 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; kb, kilobase(s). linkage. The amino-terminal 31-kDa fragment of the 69-kDa protein is shed by proteolytic cleavage, leaving a membrane-bound 40-kDa peptide. Both fragments contain N-glycosylation sites. The soluble human amino-terminal 31-kDa fragment was reported to have megakaryocyte potentiating activity in a mouse bone marrow colony assay (26Kojima T. Oh-eda M. Hattori K. Taniguchi Y. Tamura M. Ochi N. Yamaguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21984-21990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and was named megakaryocyte potentiating factor (MPF). However, there is no report in the literature to our awareness that demonstrates megakaryocyte potentiating activity either with human MPF on human cells or with mouse MPF on mouse cells. A soluble splice variant of the 40-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment called “soluble mesothelin/MPF-related” was found in sera of patients with ovarian carcinoma (27Scholler N. Fu N. Yang Y. Ye Z. Goodman G.E. Hellstrom K.E. Hellstrom I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11531-11536Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This slightly longer splice variant lacks the hydrophobic GPI anchor motif as the result of a shift in the reading frame. In addition to mesothelioma and ovarian cancer, mesothelin has recently been found to be overexpressed in cancers of the pancreas (28Argani P. Iacobuzio-Donahue C. Ryu B. Rosty C. Goggins M. Wilentz R.E. Murugesan S.R. Leach S.D. Jaffee E. Yeo C.J. Cameron J.L. Kern S.E. Hruban R.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 3862-3868PubMed Google Scholar), stomach (29Hippo Y. Yashiro M. Ishii M. Taniguchi H. Tsutsumi S. Hirakawa K. Kodama T. Aburatani H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar), lung (30Miettinen M. Sarlomo-Rikala M. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 2003; 27: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and endometrium (31Frierson Jr., H.F. Moskaluk C.A. Powell S.M. Zhang H. Cerilli L.A. Stoler M.H. Cathro H. Hampton G.M. Hum. Pathol. 2003; 34: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). At least in pancreatic cancer, expression of mesothelin is partly the result of hypomethylation of its promoter region (32Sato N. Maitra A. Fukushima N. van Heek N.T. Matsubayashi H. Iacobuzio-Donahue C.A. Rosty C. Goggins M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4158-4166PubMed Google Scholar). In a murine cell line, mesothelin has been shown to be a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (33Prieve M.G. Moon R.T. BMC Developmental Biology. 2003; http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/3/2PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in the mouse embryo was reported to be high on days 7 and 17 of gestation, but absent on day 11 and low on day 15, suggesting developmental regulation (34Bera T.K. Pastan I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mouse and human mesothelin sequences are 59% identical over the entire length of the protein. There is no obvious sequence motif except for a signal peptide on the amino terminus and a GPI anchor motif at the carboxyl terminus (25Chang K. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 26Kojima T. Oh-eda M. Hattori K. Taniguchi Y. Tamura M. Ochi N. Yamaguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21984-21990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mesothelin-deficient mice were reported to be healthy and fertile. They show normal platelet counts and no obvious phenotype (34Bera T.K. Pastan I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2902-2906Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the biological function of mesothelin is still uncertain. To get more insight into the biological function of mesothelin/MPF, we have here succeeded in isolating its receptor/binding protein. We show that mesothelin binds to CA125 and that this interaction mediates cell adhesion. Moreover, we demonstrate that CA125 and mesothelin are co-expressed in advanced stage ovarian adenocarcinoma. Taken together, our data suggest a role for CA125 and mesothelin in metastases formation of ovarian carcinoma. Cell Culture and Media—NIH:OVCAR-3 (OVCAR-3) cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 (RPMI) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10 μg/ml bovine insulin, and antibiotics. LO is a murine endothelial-like cell line derived from the mouse AGM region (35Hara T. Nakano Y. Tanaka M. Tamura K. Sekiguchi T. Minehata K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Okabe M. Kogo H. Mukouyama Y. Miyajima A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). LO cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 15% FBS, 10 μg/ml oncostatin M, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics. Human lymphoma cell lines K569 and U937 cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS and antibiotics. COS7 and human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were maintained in endothelial cell basal medium-2 (modified MCDB 131), purchased from Cambrex and supplemented as recommended by the manufacturer. Hybridoma cells were maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 85 μg/ml hypoxanthine, 24 mg/liter thymidine, and hybridoma supplement (Sigma). Cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 culture incubator at 37 °C. Inhibition of O-glycosylation in OVCAR-3 cells was carried out by adding 5 mm benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside to the culture medium over night. Antibodies and EST Clones—Anti-murine mesothelin monoclonal antibodies were generated in Wistar rats (Nihon SLC) immunized with 107 LO cells as described (35Hara T. Nakano Y. Tanaka M. Tamura K. Sekiguchi T. Minehata K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Okabe M. Kogo H. Mukouyama Y. Miyajima A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 567-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric screening against mesothelin-transfected COS7 cells identified a monoclonal antibody against mesothelin. This antibody, named B35, was produced in nude mice and purified with a protein G-Sepharose column (Hitrap, Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions from the manufacturer and diluted to 1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without preservatives. Anti-mesothelin antibody 5B2 was purchased from Novacastra Laboratories (Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom), anti-CA125 antibodies OC125 and M11 were from Dako Japan (Kyoto, Japan), anti-MUC1 antibody from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and M2 anti-FLAG tag antibody from Sigma. All these antibodies with the exception of M2 are human-specific antibodies generated in mice. I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (36Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) EST clones 4541083 (human mesothelin, full open reading frame) and 236075 (CA125, 3′-terminal 1.9 kb) were purchased from Research Genetics. Flow Cytometry and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting—Cells were harvested from culture dishes with enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and 106 cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 0.5 μg of monoclonal antibody or isotype control in 50 μl of PBS, followed by washing and labeling with fluorescein- and/or phycoerythrin-conjugated cross-species adsorbed secondary antibodies (Chemicon and Cedar Lane Laboratories, respectively). To assess ligand binding, incubation with M2 antibody was preceded by incubation in 50 μl of conditioned culture supernatant from FLAG-tagged soluble mesothelin- or mock-transfected COS7 cells and washed, if applicable. To assess blocking activity of antibody for ligand binding, a 0.2 volume conditioned medium of COS7 transfected with the soluble FLAG-tagged mesothelin cDNA was preincubated with 0.8 volume of hybridoma supernatant (or fresh culture medium as a negative control) for 15 min, then used for cell incubation for 30 min, followed by incubation with M2 and fluorescence-labeled antibody consecutively. Analyses were carried out using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). Cell sorting was carried out with a FACSVantage cell sorter (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). Library Construction, Expression Cloning, and Sequencing—Messenger RNA was extracted from one confluent 10-cm culture dish of OVCAR-3 cells using the FastTrack 2.0 kit (Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Five μg of poly(A+) RNA was used for constructing a cDNA library primed by a random hexamer primer using the Time Saver kit (Amersham Biosciences). Expression cloning of cDNA encoding a binding partner of mesothelin was carried out by using COS7 cells as previously described (37Harada N. Castle B.E. Gorman D.M. Itoh N. Schreurs J. Barrett R.L. Howard M. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except that fluorescence-activated cell sorting was employed instead of plate panning. The DNA sequences of the cDNAs were determined by using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Expression of Mesothelin in COS7 Cells and Immunoblotting— Twenty μg of expression vector containing truncated CA125 and/or mesothelin coding cDNA was electroporated into COS7 cells (107 cells/ml, 0.8 ml, at 220 V, 960 μF). After 2 days of incubation, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (PBS with 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaF, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin)), yielding ∼13 mg of total protein. 100 μl of cell lysate were put aside as controls. Three μg of OC125 antibody was added to the remaining lysate, followed by the addition of protein G Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins in the immune complexes as well as control lysates (15 μl or ∼0.2 mg of total protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blot was incubated with 5B2 antibody, followed by anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The immunocomplex was detected on Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) using an enhanced Luminol oxidation reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Heterotypic Cell Adhesion Assay—The heterotypic adhesion assay was carried out in triplicates using a protocol adapted from Cannistra et al. (38Cannistra S.A. Kansas G.S. Niloff J. DeFranzo B. Kim Y. Ottensmeier C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3830-3838PubMed Google Scholar). LO cells were grown to confluence in 6-well culture plates. Thirty minutes prior to the addition of OVCAR-3 cells, LO medium was exchanged for OVCAR-3 medium supplemented with the appropriate amount of blocking or control antibody. OVCAR-3 cells were dissociated from culture dishes with enzyme-free cell dissociation solution and added on top of the LO cells at 106 cells/well. Culture plates were spun at 800 rpm for 3 min to bring OVCAR-3 cells in contact with LO cells, then incubated at 37 °C for 60 min to adhere. Non-adherent cells were removed by repeated washing in PBS with strong finger tapping to agitate the wells. All bound cells were then dissociated with enzyme-free cell dissociation solution, counted, and analyzed by flow cytometry. MUC1 antibody was used to identify OVCAR-3 cells, B35 antibody to identify LO cells. Alternatively, mouse embryonic diaphragm cells were used instead of LO cells. Diaphragms were dissected from embryos of C57BL/6J mice at day 14.5 post coitus. Cells were dispersed with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA in PBS at 37 °C for 10 min and by repeated pipetting, and then filtered through a 40-μm mesh to obtain a single cell suspension. Cells were cultured in 6-well plates, one embryo equivalent per plate, in the same medium as LO cells but without any growth factors. On day 5 of culture, when culture had reached confluence, the adhesion of OVCAR cells to the cultured diaphragm cells was assessed exactly as described above. To block binding, 6 μg/ml antibody B35 was used. Cell binding was likewise tested in the inverse configuration. Detached LO cells or cultured embryonic diaphragm cells were added on top of confluent OVCAR-3 cells, attached by centrifugation in LO medium with or without 6 μg/ml B35 antibody, washed with PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry as above. To test whether divalent ions are required for the binding, non-attached cells were washed out with PBS supplemented with 1 mm EDTA or EGTA. Immunohistochemistry and Measurement of CA125 Serum Concentration—This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from each subject. Samples were collected from patients undergoing surgery for ovarian tumor. Serum concentration of CA125 in each patient was determined before operation by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay with the Lumipulse CA125 II kit (Fuji Rebio) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Of the 18 patients in this study, 9 had serous papillary adenocarcinomas, 3 had mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, 2 had clear cell carcinomas, 1 had an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 3 had serous adenomas, and 1 had a mucinous adenoma. Type and stage of tumors were determined according to FIGO (39Heintz A.P. Odicino F. Maisonneuve P. Beller U. Benedet J.L. Creasman W.T. Ngan H.Y. Sideri M. Pecorelli S. J. Epidemiol. Biostat. 2001; 6: 107-138PubMed Google Scholar). All specimens were fixed with 10% buffered formalin for 5 h immediately after resection and were embedded in paraffin. Immunostaining was performed with some modifications as previously described (40Morikawa Y. Ishihara Y. Tohya K. Kakudo K. Seo M.K. Matsuura N. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1996; 120: 490-496PubMed Google Scholar). Four-micrometer sections were processed for immunohistochemical procedures based on the Labeled Polymer method (Dako). Briefly, sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol for 30 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. After antigen retrieval with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako), sections were preincubated in 0.01 m PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated in primary antibodies containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 2 h. Primary antibodies 5B2 and M11 were both used at dilution 1:20. After washes with 0.1 m PBS, the sections were incubated in goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated with peroxidase-labeled dextran polymer (EnVision+, Dako) at room temperature for 30 min. After washes with 0.1 m PBS, the horse-radish peroxidase reaction was developed in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma), 0.02% nickel sulfate, and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide. Methyl green was used for counterstaining. Statistical Analysis—SAGEmap gene expression data were analyzed by pairwise linear regression and analysis of variance using the spreadsheet software Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Fisher’s exact test was used to test the association of tissue mesothelin expression with histological grade. Data from multiple experiments are expressed as mean (± standard deviation). Identification of CA125 as a Mesothelin Counter-receptor—To identify a counter-receptor of mesothelin, an expression construct of murine mesothelin fused to the FLAG peptide at the COOH terminus, mMes-f, was electroporated into COS7 cells. A double band of 40 and 46 kDa could be detected in the culture supernatant by Western blotting with M2 antibody that recognized the FLAG epitope (data not shown). Considering that the theoretical molecular mass of the epitope-tagged carboxyl-terminal fragment of mesothelin is 38.6 kDa, these two bands are in agreement with two differentially glycosylated forms of mesothelin as has been observed previously (25Chang K. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), being released into the supernatant because the fusion with the FLAG tag had destroyed the GPI linkage motif. Using culture supernatant with the recombinant mMes-f protein, we searched for cell lines that bind mesothelin by flow cytometry and found that OVCAR-3, an ovarian cancer line, showed strong specific binding (Fig. 1). The binding could be blocked significantly with B35, a monoclonal antibody specific for murine mesothelin that we had previously identified from a panel of monoclonal antibodies against LO cells. To isolate a cDNA for the mesothelin-interacting protein, we constructed a cDNA expression library of OVCAR-3 cells. The cDNA library was transfected into COS7 cells by spheroplast fusion, and COS7 cells expressing a mesothelin-binding protein were enriched by flow cytometric cell sorting. Plasmid DNA recovered from the sorted COS7 cells was subjected to a second cycle of selection. After four cycles of selection, two cDNA fragments of 1.1 and 1.6 kb were enriched. Sequencing analyses of the cloned cDNA fragments revealed that these two clones represented overlapping fragments of the same gene, corresponding in sequence to bases 63444–64531 and 63354–64956 of CA125 (GenBank™ accession AF414442). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the cloned cDNA fragments comprise 2.5 and 3.5 units of the mucinous repeats, respectively. The 23 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of the longer clone are part of a short non-repetitive sequence interspersed between the last two repeats. As expected, flow cytometric analysis revealed that COS7 cells transfected with either cloned cDNA but not mock-transfected COS7 cells could bind mMes-f protein, but not to an irrelevant FLAG-tagged protein (data not shown). Although our CA125 cDNA clones contain neither a signal peptide nor a putative transmembrane domain coding region, their protein products were evidently present on the cell surface of transfected COS7 cells. Binding Specificity—To test whether human mesothelin binds to CA125 in the same way as we had observed for mouse mesothelin, we constructed an expression construct of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of human mesothelin, termed f-δhMes, in which an amino-terminal FLAG tag is fused to human mesothelin glutamic acid 298, just below the proteolytic cleavage site. The f-δhMes expression vector was transfected into COS7 cells, and the recombinant protein could be detected at 42 and 48 kDa in cell lysates (Fig. 3B), indicating differential glycosylation as the calculated molecular mass of the recombinant protein plus GPI anchor is 40 kDa.

https://openalex.org/W1976226144,"PAR-1 kinases are required for polarity in diverse cell types, such as epithelial cells, where they localize laterally. PAR-1 activity is believed to be transduced by binding of 14-3-3 proteins to its phosphorylated substrates, but the relevant targets are unknown. We show that PAR-1 phosphorylates Bazooka/PAR-3 on two conserved serines to generate 14-3-3 binding sites. This inhibits formation of the Bazooka/PAR-6/aPKC complex by blocking Bazooka oligomerization and binding to aPKC. In epithelia, this complex localizes apically and defines the apical membrane, whereas Bazooka lacking PAR-1 phosphorylation/14-3-3 binding sites forms ectopic lateral complexes. Lateral exclusion by PAR-1/14-3-3 cooperates with apical anchoring by Crumbs/Stardust to restrict Bazooka localization, and loss of both pathways disrupts epithelial polarity. PAR-1 also excludes Bazooka from the posterior of the oocyte, and disruption of this regulation causes anterior-posterior polarity defects. Thus, antagonism of Bazooka by PAR-1/14-3-3 may represent a general mechanism for establishing complementary cortical domains in polarized cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070098436,"A 2.7-Å molecular structure of human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) was determined by x-ray crystallography. The membrane protein was modified for crystallization by replacement of the hydrophobic N-terminal transmembrane domain with a short hydrophilic sequence before residue 28. The structure of the native sequence is complete from residue 28 to the beginning of a C-terminal histidine tag used for purification. CYP2C8 is one of the principal hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes that oxidizes therapeutic drugs such as taxol and cerivastatin and endobiotics such as retinoic acid and arachidonic acid. Consistent with the relatively large size of its preferred substrates, the active site volume is twice that observed for the structure of CYP2C5. The extended active site cavity is bounded by the β1 sheet and helix F′ that have not previously been implicated in substrate recognition by mammalian P450s. CYP2C8 crystallized as a symmetric dimer formed by the interaction of helices F, F′, G′, and G. Two molecules of palmitic acid are bound in the dimer interface. The dimer is observed in solution, and mass spectrometry confirmed the association of palmitic acid with the enzyme. This novel finding identifies a peripheral binding site in P450s that may contribute to drug-drug interactions in P450 metabolism.

This novel finding identifies a peripheral binding site in P450s that may contribute to drug-drug interactions in P450 metabolism. Xenobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases provide crucial protection from the harmful effects of exposure to a wide variety of chemicals, including environmental toxins and therapeutic drugs. In general, these microsomal enzymes determine the bioavailability of hydrophobic compounds by controlling the rate of conversion to more soluble, inactive products that are readily excreted. Different P450s can show overlapping substrate specificities, and individual enzymes can interact with numerous structurally diverse substrates. This broad catalytic activity usually serves a positive defensive role; however, in some cases, it can lead to adverse drug-drug interactions. P450s often possess enzyme-specific catalytic repertoires and can display exquisite catalytic selectivity for regio- and stereospecific reactions. This is particularly evident for the mammalian family 2C P450s, which exhibit extensive, independent evolution and functional divergence in mammals, leading to multiple enzymes in each species while retaining a high degree of amino acid identity (>70%). Thus, structural comparisons within this highly related but functionally diverse P450 subfamily are likely to be particularly revealing of mechanisms leading to the catalytic diversity of P450 enzymes. The structural features of drug-metabolizing P450s that contribute to their capacity to oxidize structurally diverse substrates while maintaining site-specific oxidation is an active area of research because of the obvious benefits that this information could provide regarding xenobiotic risk assessment, the prediction and avoidance of negative drug-drug interactions, as well as the rational design of improved therapeutic drugs and specific inhibitors. Herein, we report the first structure of a catalytically active, human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) 1The abbreviations used are: P450 or CYP, generic terms for cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Individual P450 enzymes are denoted by a number/letter/number combination derived from a uniform nomenclature based on sequence identity. obtained without the use of multiple internal mutations to the catalytic domain. Analysis of this structure suggests several general mechanisms for altering the topography and function of the P450 active site. These include residue substitutions that affect the volume available for substrates, regional flexibility to enhance substrate interactions, and peripheral binding sites that can modulate active site characteristics and enable dimerization to further restrict localized adaptive changes that can influence substrate binding and oxidation. Human CYP2C8 plays a central role in the metabolism of a number of therapeutic drugs. This enzyme is expressed at relatively high levels in the liver (1Klose T.S. Blaisdell J.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 1999; 13: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 2Nishimura M. Yaguti H. Yoshitsugu H. Naito S. Satoh T. Yakugaku Zasshi. 2003; 123: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which is often the principal site for drug clearance. CYP2C8 has been shown to contribute extensively to the clearance of the anticancer drug taxol (3Rahman A. Korzekwa K.R. Grogan J. Gonzalez F.J. Harris J.W.

CYP2C8 is the primary enzyme that metabolizes a cholesterol lowering drug cerivastatin, and inhibition of its metabolism by a CYP2C8 inhibitor, gemfibrozil, a lipid lowering drug, causes a toxic drug-drug interaction that provokes rhabdomyolysis (10Prueksaritanont T.

CYP2C8 is also involved in the metabolism of natural substrates like unsaturated fatty acids and retinoic acid (13Marill J. Cresteil T. Lanotte M. Chabot G.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In human liver and kidney, CYP2C8 is the predominant P450 responsible for the oxidation of arachidonic acid to generate biologically active epoxyecosatrienoic acids that are involved in the regulation of blood pressure (14Zeldin D.C. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 15Zhao X. Imig J.D. Curr. Drug Metab. 2003; 4: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The ability to determine structures for the human drug-metabolizing P450s has been hindered by the inherent difficulties associated with crystallizing membrane enzymes. Recently, our laboratory engineered rabbit microsomal CYP2C5 for expression in Escherichia coli as a conditionally soluble membrane protein that retained catalytic activity (16Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Crystallization of the protein led to the first structure of a microsomal P450 (17Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Similar modifications to the N terminus allowed us to express the native sequence of the CYP2C8 catalytic domain for structural studies. The experimentally determined structure diverges significantly from the structure of CYP2C5 in ways that are critical for function. The major structural differences contribute to a much larger substrate binding site cavity in CYP2C8 that is compatible with its capacity to oxidize relatively large substrates such as taxol. Surprisingly, CYP2C8 crystallized as a symmetric dimer formed by the interaction of the helix F to G regions of the protein. Two molecules of palmitic acid are bound in the dimer interface. This novel finding suggests the existence of a peripheral binding site that can affect the structural dynamics of the active site and may underlie the cooperative effects of drug-drug interactions in P450 metabolism. Construction and Purification of CYP2C8dH—The CYP2C8 cDNA used for modifications was kindly provided by Robert Tukey (University of California, San Diego). The CYP2C8 cDNA was modified by replacing the sequence encoding the first 27 amino acids with one encoding a short hydrophilic, positively charged N terminus (MAKKTSSKG) identical to that employed for the expression and crystallization of CYP2C5 (16Cosme J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2545-2553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 18Von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This modification of the N terminus of CYP2C8dH converts the integral membrane protein to one that binds peripherally to membranes and that can be separated from the membrane by elevating the ionic strength of the medium. In addition, a four-residue histidine tag was added to the C terminus to facilitate purification. The modified cDNA was cloned into the pCWori plasmid for expression in E. coli. The resulting enzyme is designated CYP2C8dH. The modified enzyme was isolated in the presence of the detergent CYMAL5 (Anatrace, Maumee) as described for CYP2C5dH (19Wester M.R. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 357: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, CYP2C8dH was purified from E. coli lysates by metal ion affinity column chromatography (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Following elution of the protein in a buffer containing 40 mm histidine, the protein was subjected to CM-Sepharose ion exchange chromatography (CL6-B, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) to deplete the detergent. The purified protein was concentrated using a centrifugal device (Ultrafree-15 50K, Millipore, Billerica). CYP2B4dH and CYP2C9dH constructs were expressed and purified in a similar way as CYP2C8dH. The expression vector for 2B4dH (20Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R. White M.A. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13196-13201Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Emily Scott and Jim Halpert (University of Texas Medical Branch). Characterization of CYP2C8dH—The purified protein exhibited a specific P450 content of 18 nmol/mg of protein, and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of the purified protein indicated a molecular mass of 53,988 Da, which agrees with the 53,979 Da predicted from the amino acid composition of CYP2C8dH. The concentration of P450 was determined as described previously (21Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Based on an analysis of type I difference spectra (22Jefcoate C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 258-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), purified CYP2C8dH binds arachidonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with an apparent KD of 1.8 μm with a maximum 27% conversion of the enzyme to the high spin form. This binding constant is 6-fold lower than values measured previously for the partially purified wild type enzyme (14Zeldin D.C. DuBois R.N. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Taxol also produced a partial conversion of the enzyme to the high spin form, but the limited solubility of this substrate precluded an estimate of the binding affinity. The rate of 6α-hydroxylation of taxol (10 μm) was determined to be 0.5 nmol/min/nmol of P450, when CYP2C8dH (10 pmol) was reconstituted with 0.28 unit (1 μmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/mg) of P450 reductase in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, in the presence of 30 μg of dilaurylphosphatidylcholine in a total volume of 1 ml at 37 °C for 15 min. Product formation was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography as described (23Richardson T.H. Jung F. Griffin K.J. Wester M. Raucy J.L. Kemper B. Bornheim L.M. Hassett C. Omiecinski C.J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) using 6α-hydroxytaxol (Gentest) as a quantitative standard. The substrate was not soluble at higher concentrations precluding a determination of Vmax. Crystallization and Data Collection—The protein was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method using 2.5-μl sitting drops containing 1.25 μl of 392 μm P450, 1.12 mm CYMAL-6 detergent (Anatrace, Maumee), 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm EDTA, 0.16 mm dithiothreitol, and 16% glycerol and 1.25 μl of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15% ethanol, and 10% PEG4000. The drops were equilibrated with 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 15% ethanol, and 10% PEG4000 at 24 °C. For data collection, the crystal was soaked for 2 min in a cryoprotectant composed of 70 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10.5% ethanol, 7% PEG4000, and 30% ethylene glycol, and then flash-frozen in liquid N2 prior to transfer into the cryo-stream for data collection at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beam line 7-1. The data were collected at 100 K for a single crystal of dimensions 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.4 mm using a MAR345 image plate (Mar Research) with 2° oscillations (50 frames, 300-s exposure). The crystal did not decay noticeably during data collection. The data were processed with CCP4 programs MOSFLM and SCALA (24Leslie A.G.W.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) were employed for display electron density maps and model building. Structure Determination—The structure of CYP2C5/3LVdH (PDB ID code 1N6B) was used as the template for model building via molecular replacement. Divergent residues were truncated to Cβ in the search model. Molecular replacement was carried out with CNS (version 1.1) (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Standard refinement protocols were employed, and the refinement proceeded normally through several cycles of interpretation, editing, and adjustment of the model into σA-weighted 2 Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc (where Fo = observed structure factor and Fc = calculated structure factor) electron density maps using either Xfit/Xtalview (27McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) or O (28Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Following rebuilding, subsequent models were refined, using CNS, by simulated annealing (using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in the first rounds), and individual atomic, isotropic B-factor refinement. In addition to small individual adjustments of backbone and side chain, the peptide backbone for residues 207-217 (F/G loop) and 271-277 (polar surface loop) were entirely rebuilt, and one palmitic acid was added per protein molecule in the asymmetric unit and adjusted into the observed density. Extraction and Characterization of Fatty Acids Associated with CYP2C8dH—Tetradeuterated palmitic acid (5 nmol) (Medical Isotopes) was added to 10 nmol of different preparations of purified P450s for use as an internal standard. After an incubation with 0.5 nmol of proteinase K, 1 volume of 10 mm NaOH was added to facilitate the release of bound fatty acid. After a second addition of 1 volume of 100 mm NaOH, the pH was decreased with an excess of HCl. Samples were extracted with 2.5 volumes of organic phase (ether/hexane, 50/50), dried under nitrogen, reconstituted in methanol, and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer Life Sciences API 100 Sciex single quadrupole). Structure Determination—The structure of CYP2C8dH was determined from data collected for a single crystal diffracting to 2.7 Å. The enzyme crystallized in the C2 space group with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved initially by molecular replacement using the structure of CYP2C5/3LVdH (PDB ID code 1N6B) (29Wester M.R. Johnson E.F. Marques-Soares C. Dansette P.M. Mansuy D. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6370-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The initial maps were highly interpretable, and the overall structure is very similar to that of CYP2C5/3LVdH. However, additional refinement and rebuilding were necessary to construct divergent regions. This included portions of the polypeptide backbone that form the active site cavity. The final models for both molecules in the asymmetric unit exhibited connective electron density for residues 28-490, where the numbering corresponds to that of the native enzyme, with an R-factor of 24.7% (Rfree 28.4%) (Table I). Backbone geometry was analyzed in PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and only one residue (Gln278 in molecule B) was in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The two molecules of CYP2C8dH in the asymmetric unit are highly similar with an root mean square deviation of 0.52 Å (for 461 Cα atoms) and average B values of 60.2 Å2 and 65.8 Å2, respectively, for the A and B molecules.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsP450 construct2C8dHNo. of crystals1ComplexPalmitateSpace groupC2Unit cell (a, b, c, β) (E)105.99, 137.41, 97.32 (112.51°)Data collection and refinementWavelength (Å)1.08Resolution range (Å)50.0−2.70Total observations79,013Unique reflections > 0.0 σF34,573Completeness %aValues for the highest resolution shell are in parentheses.97.5 (97.9)〈I/σI〉aValues for the highest resolution shell are in parentheses.10.9 (1.3)Rsymm (I)aValues for the highest resolution shell are in parentheses.0.055 (0.512)R-factor0.247Rfree (5% of data)0.284Root mean square deviation bonds (Å)0.0091Root mean square deviation angles (deg)bRamachandran plot: 84.7% of residues in most favored regions; 13.9% in allowed regions; 1.2% in generously allowed regions; 0.1% in disfavored regions.1.60Model residuesNo. of atomsAvg.

Open table in a new tab Crystallization of CYP2C8dH as a Dimer Stabilized by Fatty Acids Bound in the Interface—The two molecules in the asymmetric unit form a symmetric dimer with the regions between helices F to G of molecules A and B interacting extensively (Fig. 1A). CYP2C8dH exhibits the typical P450 fold illustrated in Fig. 1B. Following the completion and building of the protein model, additional electron density was present within the dimer interface (Fig. 1C) that suggested the presence of two fatty acid molecules. A palmitic acid molecule, a C16 saturated fatty acid, was built into a long, almost continuous, tubular density with a branched terminus that resides near the N-terminal end of helix G of the dimerization partner. The average B values are slightly lower for the two palmitic acids (60.5 Å2) than the average values exhibited by the protein molecules (63.2 Å2) (Table I). The terminal portion of the aliphatic chain of the palmitic acid resides in a tubular, hydrophobic cavity formed by helices F′, G′, and G of each protein molecule (Fig. 1A). The carboxylate group of the fatty acid interacts with the backbone amides in the first turn of helix G of the second molecule in the dimer (Fig. 1C). Thus, the binding of the ionized fatty acid is likely to be stabilized by the helix dipole as well as by direct hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone amides forming the first turn of helix G. A portion of the aliphatic chains of the two fatty acids are exposed to each other and are separated by roughly 5 Å, which adds additional hydrophobic surface area to the interaction at the dimer interface. Size exclusion chromatography indicates that the isolated protein is predominantly a dimer in solution with evidence for a small amount of monomer (Fig. 2). The dimer tends to dissociate at low P450 concentrations. Ether/hexane extracts of the enzyme following proteolytic digestion and neutralization were characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). The chromatograms revealed a molecular ion with a mass that is consistent with the presence of palmitic acid, m/z 255. A second, prominent molecular ion, at m/z 283, could represent the C18 fatty acid, stearic acid. These ions were not observed in extracts from other P450s that were expressed and purified in a similar manner. It is likely that the fatty acid molecules were acquired in the E. coli host used for expression of the protein, and palmitic and stearic acid are the predominant saturated fatty acids in E. coli. The density observed for the fatty acid (Fig. 1C) is consistent with the 16 carbon aliphatic chain of palmitic acid. However, partial occupation of the site by stearic acid cannot be excluded.Fig. 3Mass spectral evidence for bound fatty acid. Negative ion electrospray mass spectra of ether/hexane extracts from 10 nmol of CYP2C8dH and CYP2C9dH are shown. Tetradeuterated-palmitic acid (5 nmol, peak 259 Da) was added to the proteins prior to extraction to provide an internal standard. Two peaks that correspond to m/z values for palmitate (255 Da) and stearate (283 Da) are present in the CYP2C8dH extract. These are not observed in extracts from CYP2C9dH, CYP2B4dH, or buffer-only samples (not shown). The molar ratio of bound fatty acid from three different purified CYP2C8dH preparations ranges from 35 to 77%, with a constant molar ratio of palmitic/stearic acid of 1.9 ± 0.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Comparison of the 2C8 and 2C5 Active Sites—Examination of the structure of CYP2C8dH indicates that the active site cavity is roughly twice as large as that of CYP2C5/3LVdH (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the capacity of CYP2C8 to oxidize larger substrates such as taxol. The increased volume of the active site results not only from changes in the conformation of portions of the protein that include helices F′ and B′, which delimit the distal portion of the active site cavity, but also from differences in the volume of side chains that occupy the cavity. The smaller volume of the CYP2C5 active site largely reflects the presence of two juxtaposed phenylalanine residues, Phe114 and Phe473 (Fig. 4). In CYP2C5, Leu213 of helix F′ is packed behind these two residues, and together they partition that section of the binding site cavity in CYP2C5. In CYP2C8, the corresponding residues are smaller, Ser114 and Ile476, and the distance between side chains increases from 5.6 Å (closest atom center to closest atom center) in CYP2C5 to 13.5 Å in CYP2C8. The size of the active site cavity is expanded through the opening between residues 114 and 476, because helix F′ of CYP2C8 is positioned up and away from these two residues, which results in a significantly larger active site cavity. This reflects a 9-Å difference in the position of the Trp212 Cα atom at the corner between helices F and F′ (Fig. 4C). Additional factors that contribute to the larger active site volume of CYP2C8 are the altered position of the B′ helix, which differs by roughly 2.4 Å from CYP2C5, and the side chains of the residues on the B′-helix that project into the substrate binding cavity are smaller in CYP2C8 than the corresponding residues in CYP2C5. The structure of CYP2C8 reported here illustrates several structural features of the xenobiotic metabolizing P450s that reflect the rapid genetic and functional diversification of these enzymes between mammalian species. Although the mammalian CYP2C enzymes generally exhibit greater than 70% amino acid identity and a higher degree of amino acid similarity, the genes encoding these enzymes exhibit extensive, independent duplication and diversification in mammalian species. As a consequence, the number of CYP2C enzymes varies among species, and each enzyme exhibits a distinct spectrum of substrate and inhibitor selectivity. This appears to reflect a high rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that alter amino acids that form the substrate binding site and contribute to the capacity to oxidize and detoxify a wide range of xenobiotics (31Waterston R.H.

https://openalex.org/W2036260456,"The ubiquitin proteasome system classically selects its substrates for degradation by tagging them with ubiquitin. Here, we describe another means of controlling proteasome function in a global manner. The 26S proteasome can be inhibited by modification with the enzyme, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This reversible modification of the proteasome inhibits the proteolysis of the transcription factor Sp1 and a hydrophobic peptide through inhibition of the ATPase activity of 26S proteasomes. The Rpt2 ATPase in the mammalian proteasome 19S cap is modified by O-GlcNAc in vitro and in vivo and as its modification increases, proteasome function decreases. This mechanism may couple proteasomes to the general metabolic state of the cell. The O-GlcNAc modification of proteasomes may allow the organism to respond to its metabolic needs by controlling the availability of amino acids and regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2109783063,"Various cell shapes are encountered in the prokaryotic world, but how they are achieved is poorly understood. Intermediate filaments (IFs) of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton play an important role in cell shape in higher organisms. No such filaments have been found in prokaryotes. Here, we describe a bacterial equivalent to IF proteins, named crescentin, whose cytoskeletal function is required for the vibrioid and helical shapes of Caulobacter crescentus. Without crescentin, the cells adopt a straight-rod morphology. Crescentin has characteristic features of IF proteins including the ability to assemble into filaments in vitro without energy or cofactor requirements. In vivo, crescentin forms a helical structure that colocalizes with the inner cell curvatures beneath the cytoplasmic membrane. We propose that IF-like filaments of crescentin assemble into a helical structure, which by applying its geometry to the cell, generates a vibrioid or helical cell shape depending on the length of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2169082359,"Recently, we demonstrated that ceramide kinase, and its product, ceramide 1-phosphate (Cer-1-P), were mediators of arachidonic acid released in cells in response to interleukin-1β and calcium ionophore (Pettus, B. J., Bielawska, A., Spiegel, S., Roddy, P., Hannun, Y. A., and Chalfant, C. E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 38206–38213). In this study, we demonstrate that down-regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) using RNA interference technology abolished the ability of Cer-1-P to induce arachidonic acid release in A549 cells, demonstrating that cPLA2 is the key phospholipase A2 downstream of Cer-1-P. Treatment of A549 cells with Cer-1-P (2.5 μm) induced the translocation of full-length cPLA2 from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus/perinuclear regions, which are known sites of translocation in response to agonists. Cer-1-P also induced the translocation of the CaLB/C2 domain of cPLA2 in the same manner, suggesting that this domain is responsive to Cer-1-P either directly or indirectly. In vitro studies were then conducted to distinguish these two possibilities. In vitro binding studies disclosed that Cer-1-P interacts directly with full-length cPLA2 and with the CaLB domain in a calcium- and lipid-specific manner with a KCa of 1.54 μm. Furthermore, Cer-1-P induced a calcium-dependent increase in cPLA2 enzymatic activity as well as lowering the EC50 of calcium for the enzyme from 191 to 31 nm.

Furthermore, it is not known whether physiologic calcium is sufficient to activate cPLA2, or whether activation also requires the generation of activating lipids. Our laboratories recently reported that ceramide kinase and its product, ceramide 1-phosphate (Cer-1-P), are mediators of calcium ionophore- and interleukin-1β-induced AA release suggesting a role for the ceramide kinase/Cer-1-P pathway in the activation of a species of PLA2 (10Pettus B.J.

In this study, mechanisms by which ceramide 1-phosphate activates cPLA2 were investigated. Cer-1-P was found to bind cPLA2 directly and to be an inducer of cPLA2 activation in vitro and in cells. Thus, for the first time, a specific intracellular target for this novel bioactive lipid has been demonstrated, establishing Cer-1-P as a signaling lipid in biological systems. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates a possible lipid “missing link” in the induction of eicosanoid synthesis in response to agonists.

The membrane was rewet in water and then blocked for 1 h in 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (FAF-BSA)/TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then exposed to 0.2 μg/ml cPLA2-GST in 3% FAF-BSA/TBS-T overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed six times for 5 min with TBS-T and then exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of anti-human cPLA2 mouse IgG (4–4B-3C) in 3% FAF-BSA/TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was again washed six times for 5 min with TBS-T and then exposed to a 1:2500 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 3% FAF-BSA/TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed 12 times for 5 min with TBS-T and then developed by ECL. Purified recombinant GST did not bind any of the lipids using this protocol (data not shown). Immunofluoresence—Cells were fixed and permeabilized in 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. Cells were immunostained with 10 μg/ml anti-human cPLA2 antibody (C20) in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% human serum for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were immunostained with 10 μg/ml anti-goat IgG-rhodamine-conjugated antibody in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% human serum for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cPLA2 localization was visualized by confocal microscopy at 568 nm using a 60× oil immersion lens with a 1.5× enhanced magnification. Immunolocalization of cPLA2—5 × 105 A549 cells were plated onto number 1 coverslips. 24 h later, the cells were starved overnight and then treated with either vehicle (0.1% dodecane:ethanol, 49:1) or 5 μm Cer-1-P. Cells were then fixed in 3.7% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature and then stained essentially as described (34Maceyka M. Machamer C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1411-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were mouse anti-GM130 for the Golgi apparatus (BD Transduction Laboratories) and goat anti-cPLA2, and secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Images were collected on a Nikon TE-300 microscope at 60× using a CoolSnap (Roper Scientific) CCD camera driven by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). cPLA2 Assay—cPLA2-GST (0.2 μg) was assayed as described (8Channon J.Y. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a liposome substrate consisting of labeled PC (1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonoyl (100,000 dpm/assay) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)), unlabeled 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl PC (Avanti) (30 μm/assay), and dioleoyl-glycerol (10 μm/assay) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was produced by sonication on ice for 3 min. d-e-C16-ceramide 1-phosphate vesicles were generated separately by sonication on ice three times for 30 s each in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. cPLA2-GST (0.2 μg) was then assayed in a base buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl, the substrate liposome, 100 μm free calcium, and varying concentrations of d-e-C16-ceramide 1-phosphate vesicles for Fig. 3A. For Fig. 3B, cPLA2-GST (0.2 μg) was assayed in a base buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl, the substrate liposome, 50 μm d-e-C16-ceramide 1-phosphate vesicles, and varying concentrations of free calcium. Quantification of the Release of Arachidonic Acid (and Metabolites)— A549 cells (5 × 104) were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (5 nm). Cells were washed and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Following treatment, medium was transferred to 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes, centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and [3H]AA (and metabolites) cpm were determined by scintillation counting. Results were controlled for equivalent number of cells quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as described (13Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L.

Transfections—A549 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of cPLA2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) or CaLB/C2-GFP for 24 h using FuGENE reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's standard protocol. Following transfection, cells were treated with 2.5 μm d-e-C16-ceramide 1-phosphate solubilized in 2% dodecane, 98% EtOH (final concentration in treatments was 0.002% dodecane, 0.098% EtOH) for 3 h. cPLA2 or CaLB/C2-GFP localization was visualized using an Olympus BX50WI confocal microscope at 488 nm (Fluoview detector) using a 40× liquid immersible lens with 1.5× enhanced magnification. RNA Interference (RNAi)—Sequence-specific silencing of cPLA2 was performed essentially as described using sequence-specific small interfering RNA reagents (10Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Spiegel S.

All sequences were evaluated against the data base using the NIH BLAST program to test for specificity (Xeragon). A549 or J447.1 cells (5 × 104) were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Following the 4-h transfection, cells were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (5 nm). Cells were washed and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. The optimal down-regulation time for cPLA2 was 48 h post-transfection as judged by Western immunoblotting with an anti-cPLA2 monoclonal antibody anti-cPLA2 that recognizes both mouse and human cPLA2. Total protein was normalized using post-Amido Black staining of polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and by simultaneous ECL development of α-tubulin using an anti-α-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Large Multilamellar Vesicle Binding Assay—Large multilamellar vesicles for Cer-1-P were produced by drying 68.3 μl of a 1 mg/ml d-e-C18:1 ceramide 1-phosphate under nitrogen for each reaction. A solution (100 μl) of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl solution for each reaction was added, and the lipid was vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Cer-1-P LMVs (100 μl) were mixed with buffer A (200 μl) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm EDTA), and for calcium-containing reactions Cer-1-P LMVs were mixed with 4.4 mm CaCl2. The binding reaction was initiated by the addition of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl containing 0.2 μg of cPLA2-GST. After 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml polypropylene tube. 200 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer was added to the lipid pellet, and 100 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer was added to the 400 μl of supernatant. 35 μl of the lipid pellet was subjected to SDS-PAGE as described in Fig. 4A. Purified recombinant GST did not bind any of the lipids using this protocol (data not shown). Ceramide 1-Phosphate Activates cPLA2 in Cells—We have shown previously (10Pettus B.J. Bielawska A. Spiegel S. Roddy P. Hannun Y.A. Chalfant C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38206-38213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that Cer-1-P specifically induces AA release in cells, and the generation of Cer-1-P is required for cytokine- and calcium ionophore-induced eicosanoid synthesis. These results suggested the activation of cPLA2 in response to Cer-1-P. Therefore, at first, it became important to establish that cPLA2 is the specific enzyme responsible for AA release in response to Cer-1-P. To determine whether cPLA2 is downstream of Cer-1-P, RNAi technology was employed to knock down cPLA2. OligofectAMINE transfection of fluoresceintagged RNAi gave a transfection efficiency of 85% at 24 and 48 h in A549 cells (Table I). Using these conditions, cPLA2 expression was down-regulated 81.3% with specific RNAi after 48 h post-transfection in A549 cells (Table I). This resulted in a 79.4% inhibition of Cer-1-P-induced (2.5 μm for 3 h) release of AA and metabolites in these cells as compared with scrambled RNAi and sham controls (Fig. 1). Normalization of these results to down-regulation of total cPLA2 showed a nearly total abrogation of the Cer-1-P effects.Table INormalization of transfection efficiency, cPLA2 down-regulation, and inhibition of AA release by RNAi technology in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells Data are representative of three separate determinations on two separate occasions.TimeaTime from the end of the RNAi transfection to analysis of cPLA2 expression and the start of the assay for C-1-P-induced AA releaseTransfection efficiencybMean percentage of the number of cells demonstrating intracellular fluorescence of RNAi (1 × 103 cells scored)cPLA2 down-regulationcMean percentage of the down-regulation of immunoreactive cPLA2 normalized to total protein and α-tubulin as compared to scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)Inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA releasedMean percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 3 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)Inhibition (normalized to cPLA2 down-regulation)ePercentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-Induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 3 h) as compared to scrambled (control) RNAi (100%) normalized to the percent of cPLA2 downregulationh%%%%2485.057.052.493.24885.081.379.497.7a Time from the end of the RNAi transfection to analysis of cPLA2 expression and the start of the assay for C-1-P-induced AA releaseb Mean percentage of the number of cells demonstrating intracellular fluorescence of RNAi (1 × 103 cells scored)c Mean percentage of the down-regulation of immunoreactive cPLA2 normalized to total protein and α-tubulin as compared to scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)d Mean percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 3 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)e Percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-Induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 3 h) as compared to scrambled (control) RNAi (100%) normalized to the percent of cPLA2 downregulation Open table in a new tab In another model of inflammation, J774.1 macrophages, cPLA2 expression was down-regulated by 61% using specific RNAi after 48 h as judged by Western immunoblotting (Table II). As with the A549 cells, AA release elicited by treatment with Cer-1-P (2.5 μm for 2 h) was inhibited to a similar extent (59%) (Table II). Thus, normalization of these results to down-regulation of total cPLA2 again showed a nearly total abrogation of the Cer-1-P effects (Table II). These data indicate that Cer-1-P induces AA release via activation of cPLA2 in cells.Table IINormalization of transfection efficiency, cPLA2 down-regulation, and inhibition of AA release by RNAi technology in J774.1 mouse macrophage cells Data are representative of three separate determinations on two separate occasions.TimeaTime from the end of the RNAi transfection to analysis of cPLA2 expression and the start of the assay for C-1-P-induced AA releaseTransfection efficiencybMean percentage of the number of cells demonstrating intracellular fluorescence of RNAi (1 × 103 cells scored)cPLA2 down-regulationcMean percentage of the down-regulation of immunoreactive cPLA2 normalized to total protein and α-tubulin as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)Inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA releasedMean percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 2 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)Inhibition (normalized to cPLA2 down-regulation)ePercentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 2 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%) normalized to the percent of cPLA2 down-regulationh%%%24NDfND, not determined36.03083.348ND615996.7a Time from the end of the RNAi transfection to analysis of cPLA2 expression and the start of the assay for C-1-P-induced AA releaseb Mean percentage of the number of cells demonstrating intracellular fluorescence of RNAi (1 × 103 cells scored)c Mean percentage of the down-regulation of immunoreactive cPLA2 normalized to total protein and α-tubulin as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)d Mean percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 2 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%)e Percentage of the inhibition of C-1-P-induced AA release (2.5 μm C-1-P for 2 h) as compared with scrambled (control) RNAi (100%) normalized to the percent of cPLA2 down-regulationf ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Because the above results implicated cPLA2 as a downstream target for the action of Cer-1-P, studies were undertaken to determine whether Cer-1-P activates cPLA2 in cells.

https://openalex.org/W2061791098,"The eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is the core of a multicomponent switch controlling gene expression at the level of translation initiation. It interacts with the small ribosomal subunit interacting protein, eIF3, and the eIF4E/cap-mRNA complex in order to load the ribosome onto mRNA during cap-dependent translation. We describe the solution structure of the complex between yeast eIF4E/cap and eIF4G (393-490). Binding triggers a coupled folding transition of eIF4G (393-490) and the eIF4E N terminus resulting in a molecular bracelet whereby eIF4G (393-490) forms a right-handed helical ring that wraps around the N terminus of eIF4E. Cofolding allosterically enhances association of eIF4E with the cap and is required for maintenance of optimal growth and polysome distributions in vivo. Our data explain how mRNA, eIF4E, and eIF4G exists as a stable mRNP that may facilitate multiple rounds of ribosomal loading during translation initiation, a key determinant in the overall rate of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2142106325,"Plasmodium sporozoites are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes and invade hepatocytes as a first and obligatory step of the parasite life cycle in man. Hepatocyte invasion involves proteins secreted from parasite vesicles called micronemes, the most characterized being the thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP). Here we investigated the expression and function of another microneme protein recently identified in Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1). P. falciparum AMA-1 is expressed in sporozoites and is lost after invasion of hepatocytes, and anti-AMA-1 antibodies inhibit sporozoite invasion, suggesting that the protein is involved during invasion of hepatocytes. As observed with TRAP, AMA-1 is initially mostly sequestered within the sporozoite. Upon microneme exocytosis, AMA-1 and TRAP relocate to the sporozoite surface, where they are proteolytically cleaved, resulting in the shedding of soluble fragments. A subset of serine protease inhibitors blocks the processing and shedding of both AMA-1 and TRAP and inhibits sporozoite infectivity, suggesting that interfering with sporozoite proteolytic processing may constitute a valuable strategy to prevent hepatocyte infection.

The apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is a causative agent of malaria, one of the major human infectious diseases, responsible for more than 1 million deaths per year worldwide. Plasmodium sporozoites are transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes and invade the liver of the mammalian host, where they undergo schizogony and differentiate into merozoites that subsequently invade erythrocytes and cause disease. Blocking sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes represents an attractive anti-malarial strategy because it would prevent malaria symptoms and parasite transmission to the mosquito, which both occur at erythrocytic stages. Sporozoites migrate through tissues and invade target cells using gliding motility (1Kappe S.H. Kaiser K. Matuschewski K. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 135-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), a process involving secretory vesicles called micronemes. Upon microneme exocytosis, proteins are delivered onto the parasite surface and then redistributed from the anterior to the posterior end of the parasite, leading to its forward movement and penetration into a host cell (2Menard R. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).

A. 1985; 82: 3252-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Culture of P. falciparum Liver Stages—Human hepatocytes were cultured for at least 48 h before inoculation with P. falciparum sporozoites (18Mazier D. Beaudoin R.L. Mellouk S. Druilhe P. Texier B. Trosper J. Miltgen F. Landau I. Paul C. Brandicourt O. et al.Science. 1985; 227: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). After the removal of medium from the culture chambers, sporozoites in culture medium were added to the Lab-Tek wells (1 × 105 sporozoites/well) or plate wells (1 × 106 sporozoites/well) and incubated with the hepatocytes for 3 h. The cultures were then washed and further incubated in complete culture medium supplemented with 0.25% Me2SO. Culture medium was renewed every 2-3 days.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was purified from P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites using the QIAamp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), including a DNase treatment step. Reverse transcription was performed using the ProSTAR First-Strand reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Stratagene). One μl of cDNA was PCR amplified with the sense primer 5′-TTCAAATACTACTTTTTTAACACCG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CTCTTTCGATTTCTTTCATTATTTC-3′, by use of 40 cycles of 45 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 45 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 60 s of elongation at 70 °C. The resulting products (890-base pair amplicon) were stained with ethidium bromide and run on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetate-EDTA buffer.Immunofluorescence Assays—For detection of AMA-1 expression in P. falciparum sporozoites and liver stages, air-dried sporozoites and methanol-fixed infected hepatocyte cultures were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min and then incubated with anti-PfAMA-1 mAb DV5 for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with GAM-FITC and 1 μg/ml DNA stain diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI) for 30 min before examination by fluorescence confocal microscopy. Surface staining was performed on nonpermeabilized sporozoites deposited on poly-l-lysine-coated multiwell glass slides, in a “wet” sporozoite assay (20Druilhe P. Pradier O. Marc J.P. Miltgen F. Mazier D. Parent G. Infect. Immun. 1986; 53: 393-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); sporozoites were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, and endogenous fluorescence was quenched with 0.1 m glycine. The parasites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-PfAMA-1 mAbs DV5, 1F9, or 5G8 or rabbit polyclonal anti-PfAMA-1 IgG, as indicated in the figure legends) for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (GAM-FITC for mAbs or GAR- Alexa Fluor® 594 for rabbit IgG) and DAPI for 1 h before examination by fluorescence microscopy.Western Blotting and Secretion Assays—For detection of parasite proteins in sporozoite lysates and supernatants, the parasites were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubated at 70 °C for 5 min. The protein samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (1 × 105 parasites or equivalent/lane for AMA-1 and TRAP detection, 1 × 103 parasites or equivalent/lane for CSP detection) and transferred onto polyvinylidene membranes. These were probed with primary antibodies, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and antigens were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. To analyze proteins secreted in the parasite supernatant, sporozoites were resuspended in medium without serum and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of hepatocytes. The parasite suspension was then dissolved by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some experiments, the supernatants were separated from the sporozoites by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the parasite pellets and supernatants were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer separately.Gliding Assays—To analyze sporozoite motility, 30,000 sporozoites were deposited on multispot glass slide wells precoated with anti-PfCSP mAb E9 (100 μg/ml 1 h at 37 °C) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed, and the deposited CSP trails were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The trails were then labeled using the anti-PfCSP mAb E9 conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 and visualized under a fluorescence microscope.Inhibition of Sporozoite Invasion Assays—To analyze sporozoite invasion, triplicate hepatocyte cultures were inoculated with P. falciparum sporozoites (1 × 105/Lab-Tek well). After 3 h at 37 °C, the cultures were washed, further incubated in fresh medium for 3 days, and then fixed in methanol. Liver schizonts were stained using an anti-HSP-70 mouse serum followed by goat anti-mouse FITC conjugate and counted under a fluorescence microscope. To determine the effects of anti-AMA-1 antibodies on sporozoite infectivity, sporozoites were incubated with hepatocytes in the presence of increasing concentrations of anti-PfAMA-1 rabbit IgG. The percentage of inhibition was determined in comparison with control rabbit IgG. To determine the effects of protease inhibitors and cytochalasin D on sporozoite infectivity, P. falciparum sporozoites were incubated with these inhibitors (each from a 100× stock solution diluted directly in the parasite suspension) for 5 min at room temperature and then washed (except for cytochalasin D, the effects of which are reversible) before inoculation onto hepatocytes. The percentage of inhibition was determined in comparison with control sporozoites treated with solvents alone. Inhibition results were analyzed for statistical significance using the one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test.RESULTSAMA-1 Is Expressed in P. falciparum Sporozoites—In a recent analysis of P. falciparum proteome, peptides corresponding to the merozoite antigen AMA-1 were identified in sporozoites. Because AMA-1 had never been reported in sporozoites before, we were interested in further characterizing its expression at this stage. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, we could readily detect ama-1 transcripts in salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 1A), thus confirming the expression of the gene at this stage. To test whether AMA-1 protein is also present in sporozoites, we performed immunofluorescence assays using the anti-PfAMA-1 domain III mAb DV5 (8Mueller M.S. Renard A. Boato F. Vogel D. Naegeli M. Zurbriggen R. Robinson J.A. Pluschke G. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All permeabilized sporozoites displayed a strong fluorescence (Fig. 1B), with a bipolar nucleus-sparing pattern similar to the immunofluorescence pattern observed with antibodies to TRAP, also known as sporozoite surface protein 2 (12Charoenvit Y. Fallarme V. Rogers W.O. Sacci Jr., J.B. Kaur M. Aguiar J.C. Yuan L.F. Corradin G. Andersen E. Wizel B. Houghten R.A. Oloo A. De la Vega P. Hoffman S.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3430-3437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, surface labeling with the anti-AMA-1 mAb showed no or very little surface fluorescence on sporozoites (Fig. 1C). When detected, AMA-1 surface fluorescence was restricted to the apical extremity of the sporozoites, on the same side of the nucleus as the apicoplast, a DNA-containing organelle visualized as a DAPI-positive spot forward of the nucleus, as described in Toxoplasma (21Fichera M.E. Roos D.S. Nature. 1997; 390: 407-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 22Kohler S. Delwiche C.F. Denny P.W. Tilney L.G. Webster P. Wilson R.J. Palmer J.D. Roos D.S. Science. 1997; 275: 1485-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). A similar surface fluorescence pattern was observed using polyclonal anti-PfAMA-1 antibodies (see Fig. 5A). Western blotting of protein extracts from P. falciparum sporozoites probed with DV5 confirmed AMA-1 expression in sporozoites. Two proteins of ∼83 and ∼66 kDa were detected in both sporozoites and parasitized erythrocytes and were absent from noninfected mosquito salivary glands (Fig. 1D). In P. falciparum erythrocytic stages, these two bands have been shown to correspond respectively to a precursor protein that contains a prosequence and to a mature form of AMA-1 that lacks the prosequence (23Crewther P.E. Culvenor J.G. Silva A. Cooper J.A. Anders R.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1990; 70: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Howell S.A. Withers-Martinez C. Kocken C.H. Thomas A.W. Blackman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31311-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To confirm that the two bands observed in the sporozoite lysates also correspond to the precursor and mature forms, we performed Western blot analysis using the anti-AMA-1 mAbs 1F9, specific for P. falciparum AMA-1 domain I, and 5G8, specific for AMA-1 prosequence. The mAb 5G8 recognized only the upper ∼83-kDa band, whereas 1F9 recognized both the ∼83-kDa and ∼66-kDa proteins (Fig. 1E), thus confirming that in P. falciparum sporozoites these two bands correspond to the precursor and the mature form of AMA-1, respectively. The relative amount of precursor and mature proteins detected by Western blot varied between the different sporozoite preparations (Fig. 1 and see Fig. 4).Fig. 5Protease inhibitors and cytochalasin D do not prevent AMA-1 translocation to the sporozoite surface upon incubation at 37 °C.

Beaudoin R.L. Mellouk S. Druilhe P. Texier B. Trosper J. Miltgen F. Landau I. Paul C. Brandicourt O. et al.Science. 1985; 227: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We consistently failed to detect the protein in early liver stages by immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 2), suggesting that it was lost after invasion of hepatocytes. AMA-1 was only re-expressed in mature P. falciparum liver schizonts, with a punctate pattern likely corresponding to nascent liver merozoites (Fig. 2).Fig. 2AMA-1 is lost after invasion of hepatocytes and re-expressed in liver merozoites.P. falciparum liver schizonts (arrowheads) stained with the anti-AMA-1 mAb DV5 (green) and DAPI (blue), 3, 8, or 10 days after infection of human hepatocyte cultures with sporozoites.

Therefore, we tested whether antibodies to AMA-1 could inhibit the invasion of hepatocytes by P. falciparum sporozoites. Polyclonal IgG raised in rabbits immunized with a recombinant AMA-1 protein from the P. falciparum 3D7 clone (10Hodder A.N. Crewther P.E. Anders R.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3286-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) inhibited invasion of human hepatocytes by NF54 (homologous strain) P. falciparum sporozoites in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Relatively high concentrations were necessary to achieve significant inhibition, but equivalently high concentrations of IgG from rabbits immunized with a reduced and alkylated form of the recombinant 3D7 PfAMA-1 protein did not inhibit sporozoite invasion (Fig. 3), indicating that inhibition is mediated by antibodies directed to conformational epitopes. IgG from rabbits immunized with a recombinant AMA-1 from the P. falciparum heterologous strain FVO (11Kocken C.H. Withers-Martinez C. Dubbeld M.A. van der Wel A. Hackett F. Valderrama A. Blackman M.J. Thomas A.W. Infect.

Human hepatocytes were inoculated with P. falciparum NF54 sporozoites in the presence of IgG from rabbits immunized with a 3D7 clone PfAMA-1 recombinant protein (gray bars), with a reduced and alkylated form of this 3D7 PfAMA-1 recombinant protein (white bar), or with a FVO strain PfAMA-1 recombinant protein (black bar).

Sporozoite surface AMA-1 reacted with 1F9 but not with 5G8 mAb, indicating that only the mature 66-kDa protein translocates to the parasite surface (see Fig. 6, C and D). As expected, both 5G8 and 1F9 mAbs labeled air-dried permeabilized sporozoites (see Fig. 6, A and B) with a fluorescent pattern similar to that observed with DV5. In P. falciparum merozoites, AMA-1 translocates to the surface upon microneme exocytosis and is proteolytically cleaved and shed as soluble fragments (14Howell S.A. Wells I. Fleck S.L.

Titin is known to be extremely susceptible to calcium-dependent protease degradation in vitro. We hypothesized that titin degradation is an early event in doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury and that titin degradation occurs by activation of the calcium-dependent proteases, the calpains. Treatment of cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes with 1 or 3 μmol/liter doxorubicin for 24 h resulted in degradation of titin in myocyte lysates, which was confirmed by a reduction in immunostaining of an antibody to the spring-like (PEVK) domain of titin at the I-band of the sarcomere. The elastic domain of titin appears to be most susceptible to proteolysis because co-immunostaining with an antibody to titin at the M-line was preserved, suggesting targeted proteolysis of the spring-like domain of titin. Doxorubicin treatment for 1 h resulted in ∼3-fold increase in calpain activity, which remained elevated at 48 h. Co-treatment with calpain inhibitors resulted in preservation of titin, reduction in myofibrillar disarray, and attenuation of cardiomyocyte necrosis but not apoptosis. Co-treatment with a caspase inhibitor did not prevent the degradation of titin, which precludes caspase-3 as an early mechanism of titin proteolysis. We conclude that calpain activation is an early event after doxorubicin treatment in cardiomyocytes and appears to target the degradation of titin. Proteolysis of the spring-like domain of titin may predispose cardiomyocytes to diastolic dysfunction, myofilament instability, and cell death by necrosis.

Titin is the largest known protein and is an integral part of the myofilament system in vertebrate striated muscle. Full-length titin extends the half-sarcomere from the Z-disk to the M-line, with the I-band region comprised of distinct elastic segments that account for the extensibility of titin. Titin has been implicated in the process of sarcomerogenesis, where it is thought to serve as a framework for ordered assembly of myofilament proteins (1Tokuyasu K.T. Maher P.A. J.

Given the central role of titin in sarcomere formation as well as myocyte mechanics, pathological conditions leading to enhanced titin degradation may have profound consequences for myofilament stability and function. Indeed, there is evidence for disorganization and loss of titin in ischemic and failing human hearts (10Morano I. Hadicke K. Grom S. Koch A. Schwinger R.H. Bohm M. Bartel S. Erdmann E. Krause E.G. J.

The mechanisms, however, for cardiac titin degradation under normal and pathological conditions have not been examined. Titin is known to be extremely sensitive to proteolysis, in vitro, which is preventable with calcium chelation in combination with leupeptin protease inhibition, conditions known to be necessary for inhibition of the calcium-dependent proteases, the calpains (13Wang K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1984; 170: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The calpains are a family of calcium-dependent cysteine proteases that are believed to participate in basic calcium-mediated intracellular processes (14Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Of the calpain family, calpain isoenzymes I (μ-calpain) and II (m-calpain) are ubiquitously expressed and are activated in vitro in the presence of micro- and millimolar concentrations of calcium, respectively. Although the exact physiological role of calpains in the myocardium is not known, the ability of calpains to cleave cytoskeletal and myofilament proteins desmin, fodrin, filamin, C-protein, tropomyosin, troponin T, troponin I, nebulin, gelsolin, and vinculin in a variety of cell types, in vitro, suggest a regulatory role for calpains in remodeling of the myofibril (15Matsumura Y.

The association between p94 and titin is of particular interest to researchers in food science, where the level of calpain activity and the degree of titin degradation have been related to postmortem meat tenderness (27Uytterhaegen L. Claeys E. Demeyer D. J. Anim. Sci. 1994; 72: 1209-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Huff-Lonergan E. Parrish Jr., F.C. Robson R.M. J. Anim. Sci. 1995; 73: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The extreme sensitivity of titin to calcium-dependent proteolysis as well as the known association between titin and p94 in skeletal muscle make titin a plausible target of the calpains in cardiac muscle. Doxorubicin cardiomyopathy is typically associated with myofibrillar deterioration; however, the early mechanisms responsible for this degenerative phenotype remain elusive (for review see Ref. 29Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In addition to myofilament damage, doxorubicin is also known to cause intracellular calcium overload (29Singal P.K. Deally C.M. Weinberg L.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1987; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These two aspects of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity may well be related, where a pathological increase in intracellular calcium may trigger indiscriminate activation of calcium-dependent proteases resulting in degradation of key myofibrillar proteins. We therefore hypothesized that titin degradation is an early process in doxorubicin-induced myofilament injury, with consequences for myofilament stability and perhaps cell viability. We further hypothesized that titin proteolysis occurs by the action of the calcium-dependent proteases, the calpains. To test the prospective role for calpains in pathologic titin degradation, we used a cell culture model of anthracycline-induced myofilament injury. Our results support a role for calpain in titin proteolysis early after doxorubicin treatment. The implications of these findings for doxorubicin and other forms of myocardial injury are discussed. Cell Culture—Adult rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150-200 g, plated at medium to low density, and cultured according to a protocol described previously (30Sawyer D.B. Zuppinger C. Miller T.A. Eppenberger H.M. Suter T.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1551-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Culture medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5 mmol/liter creatine (Sigma), 2 mmol/liter l-carnitine (Sigma), 5 mmol/liter taurine (Sigma), 1% 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 7% preselected fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 100 μmol/liter bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma). Culture media were replaced 2 h after plating and every 72 h. Myocytes were treated on day 10 in culture with 1 or 3 μmol/liter doxorubicin (Sigma) and incubated for 1, 6, 24, or 48 h. Calpain inhibitors ALLN 1The abbreviations used are: ALLN, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-norleucinal; BDFMK, Boc-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CK, creatine kinase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum. (Sigma), calpeptin (Calbiochem), calpastatin (Calbiochem), or leupeptin (Peptide International Institute) or caspase inhibitor BDFMK (Sigma) were added to myocytes (at concentrations indicated elsewhere) 1 h prior to doxorubicin treatment. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated as described previously (31Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin prior to treatment. Neonatal myocytes were treated with 0.5 μmol/liter doxorubicin without or with protease inhibitors (ALLN or BDFMK) and incubated for 24 h. Gel Electrophoresis—Following treatment, myocytes were solubilized by adding 1 volume of cell suspension to 9 volumes of solubilization buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, pH 6.8 at 25 °C) preheated to 90-95 °C. The samples were solubilized for 60 s and allowed to cool down to room temperature. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method. Bromphenol blue was added (0.025%), and equal amounts of sample (200 μg) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 2% acrylamide gel strengthened with 0.5% agarose (32Tatsumi R. Hattori A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Gels were run at 15 mA for 4 h at room temperature and fixed in 50% methanol and 7% acetic acid. Gels were stained with Coomassie overnight, destained with 50% methanol, 7% acetic acid followed by 5% methanol, 7% acetic acid. Wet gels were scanned at 400 or 900 dpi using a commercially available scanner (Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). T1 titin (both N2B and N2BA isoforms), titin degradation product T2, total titin (T1 isoforms + T2), and myosin heavy chain from the same samples were quantitated by densitometry. Total titin, T1, and T2 were normalized relative to myosin heavy chain to account for potential inaccuracies in protein loading. Calpain Assay—Calpain activity was determined using a fluorogenic assay as described by Sasaki et al. (33Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the experimental protocol, myocytes were harvested and sonicated in calcium-free assay buffer containing 63.2 mmol/liter imidazole-HCl, 20 mmol/liter EGTA, 25 mmol/liter EDTA, and 10 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.3. Samples were diluted to 1 mg/ml, and 25 μl of sample was combined with either 75 μl of calcium-free assay buffer or 75 μl of calcium buffer (containing 63.2 mmol/liter imidazole-HCl, 1.25 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 10 mmol/liter 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.3) in a 96-well fluorescent plate. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin was added to the samples for a final concentration of 50 μmol/liter. After an additional 30 min of incubation, fluorescence was detected at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. Calpain activity was determined as the difference between the calcium-dependent and the calcium-independent fluorescence. All experiments were run in duplicate. Caspase-3 Assay—The caspase-3 activity within the cells was measured with a caspase-3 fluorescent assay kit (Molecular Probes). Briefly, the caspase-3-specific substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amido-4-methylcoumarin was incubated with 20 μg of myocyte lysates at room temperature for 30 min, and fluorescence of the cleaved product was detected at 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. All experiments were run in duplicate. The specificity of the cleavage reaction was verified by including 10 μmol/liter acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO (caspase-3 inhibitor) in the incubation, and <10% of activity was detected. Fura-2 Measurement—Calcium transients were measured using the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2, as described previously (34Lim C.C. Apstein C.S. Colucci W.S. Liao R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, redifferentiated cardiomyocytes treated with 1 μmol/liter doxorubicin at the indicated time points were incubated for 15 min in Tyrode's buffer (in mmol/liter: NaCl 137, KCl 5.4, CaCl2 1.2, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 10, and glucose 10, pH 7.4, 37 °C) containing 1 μmol/liter membrane-permeant fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) and 500 μmol/liter probenicid (Sigma) to prevent leakage of fura-2 from cells. Fura-2 loaded cardiomyocytes were perfused in a cell chamber with Tyrode's buffer maintained at 37 °C and field-stimulated at 3 Hz. Calcium transients were measured by dual excitation (360 and 380 nm) of the fura-2-loaded cells, and emission fluorescence was recorded at 510 nm (IonOptix Inc.). The fluorescence ratio (F360/F380) and time constant (τ) of the calcium transient decay reflect the intracellular calcium concentration, and the rate of cytosolic calcium removal, respectively. The area under the calcium transient reflects the total amount of cytosolic calcium throughout the contractile cycle. Western Blot Analysis—Total cell lysates (40-100 μg) were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred on polyvinylidene fluoride membrane blots using the Bio-Rad transfer system. Blots were incubated with primary antibodies: α-actinin (1:2000, Sigma), desmin (1:2000, Sigma), total actin (1:2000, Sigma), calpain-I (1:1000, Sigma), calpain-II (1:500, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.), and calpastatin (1:1000, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.). Blots were subsequently incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and band intensities were detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce) and quantitated using densitometry (Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with primary antibodies to α-actinin, myomesin (clone B4, a kind gift from Dr. Jean-Claude Perriard), titin PEVK domain (9D10; developed by Dr. Marion Greaser at the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa), and titin M-line domain (M8; courtesy of Dr. Mathias Gautel). Myocytes were subsequently incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin or fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin for staining of filamentous actin, and secondary antibodies were conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, TRITC, or cyan-5 (Molecular Probes). Stained preparations were analyzed with a Leica confocal scanner TCS NT on an inverted microscope Leica DMIRB-E. Myofibrillar disarray was assessed by an investigator blinded to treatments using a Nikon Diaphot 300 fluorescence microscope equipped with a 40× oil immersion objective. A total of 100-150 myocytes were counted for each experimental condition in each experiment. Trypan Blue Staining and Creatine Kinase Assay—Following treatment, media were collected for each experiment and frozen at -80 °C for determination of creatine kinase activity. Myocytes from the same experiments were subsequently stained with 0.4% trypan blue as described previously (35Kuramochi Y. Lim C.C. Guo X. Colucci W.S. Liao R. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 286: C222-C229Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Creatine kinase activity in the media samples was determined from a diagnostic kit according to manufacturer's instructions (CK-10, Sigma). Time-lapse Video Microscopy—Cardiomyocytes were maintained in an incubation and perfusion system with CO2 and humidity controller on a heated microscope stage (Carl Zeiss Co.) during acquisition of video time-lapse images. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to doxorubicin for 48 h, and images were acquired every 15 min using an automated shutter and video camera (Kappa Opto-Electronics Inc.). Following the video time-lapse, the same area was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for myomesin and actin for confocal microscopy. Flow Cytometry—Apoptotic neonatal myocytes were quantified by flow cytometric analysis as previously described (31Sawyer D.B. Fukazawa R. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, following treatment both detached and trypsinized adherent cells were pelleted, resuspended in PBS (Invitrogen), fixed in 70% ethanol/PBS, and stored at -20 °C until use. Cells were rinsed once in PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 20 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (5 kilounits/ml, Sigma). After a 2-h incubation period at room temperature, 10,000 cells from each sample were counted by FACScan (BD Biosciences). Gating was performed to exclude small debris with >2 logs weaker propidium iodide fluorescence than G0 cells. Apoptosis was calculated as the percent of cells in the sub-G1/G0 peak. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E., unless indicated otherwise. Where appropriate, results were analyzed by Student's t test or analysis of variance with a post-hoc test of least significant differences. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Doxorubicin Degrades Titin in Intact Cardiomyocytes—We examined the effect of doxorubicin on titin using 2% Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1). As reported previously (36Cazorla O. Freiburg A. Helmes M. Centner T. McNabb M. Wu Y. Trombitas K. Labeit S. Granzier H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), control rat myocytes express a predominant N2B titin band with a minor N2BA band compared with human and pig myocardium (see calibration gel). Incubation of myocytes with 1 μmol/liter doxorubicin resulted in partial degradation of titin, as evidenced by the appearance of titin degradation product T2 (Fig. 1, A and B). Table I shows that compared with the untreated control group, the T2/MHC ratio increased with doxorubicin incubation time and that pretreatment with calpain inhibitor ALLN, but not caspase inhibitor BDFMK, prevented the increase in the T2/MHC ratio. Interestingly, there was no difference in the total titin (T1 isoforms + T2)/MHC ratio, suggesting a very specific and limited degradation of titin to its T2 fragment at the time points studied (Table I). Higher concentrations of doxorubicin and longer incubation times, on the other hand, resulted in almost complete degradation of titin (Fig. 1, B and C). Pretreatment of myocytes with calpain inhibitors ALLN (100 μmol/liter), calpeptin (5 μmol/liter), or leupeptin (50 μmol/liter) for 1 h prior to doxorubicin treatment preserved titin similar to control levels, whereas caspase inhibitor BDFMK (100 μmol/liter) had no effect (Fig. 1, A-C).Table IComparison of sarcomere proteins in 1 μmol/liter doxorubicin-treated cardiomyocytesControl6 h24 h24 h + ALLN24 h + BDFMKT2/MHC0.015 ± 0.0020.018 ± 0.0020.026 ± 0.005ap < 0.005 versus control.bp < 0.05 versus 6 h.cp < 0.01 versus 24 h + ALLN.0.017 ± 0.0020.025 ± 0.006ap < 0.005 versus control.bp < 0.05 versus 6 h.cp < 0.01 versus 24 h + ALLN.T1/MHC0.195 ± 0.0170.193 ± 0.0140.189 ± 0.0130.194 ± 0.0140.187 ± 0.010Total titin/MHC0.211 ± 0.0190.211 ± 0.0160.214 ± 0.0180.211 ± 0.0160.213 ± 0.010MHC1.00 ± 0.030.99 ± 0.031.01 ± 0.021.00 ± 0.041.01 ± 0.03α-Actinin1.00 ± 0.160.98 ± 0.130.94 ± 0.131.11 ± 0.171.06 ± 0.07Actin1.00 ± 0.110.99 ± 0.141.04 ± 0.131.02 ± 0.071.00 ± 0.03Desmin1.00 ± 0.121.00 ± 0.130.98 ± 0.071.01 ± 0.130.97 ± 0.18a p < 0.005 versus control.b p < 0.05 versus 6 h.c p < 0.01 versus 24 h + ALLN. Open table in a new tab Western blot analysis and wet gel scans were performed to determine the effect of doxorubicin on other sarcomeric proteins. Treatment with 1 μmol/liter doxorubicin up to 24 h had no effect on protein levels of α-actinin, actin, desmin, or myosin heavy chain (Table I). Thus, doxorubicin treatment of myocytes results in early degradation of titin, which is preventable with calpain but not caspase inhibition. Doxorubicin Activates the Calpains and Caspase-3—The effect of doxorubicin on protease activity was examined in adult rat ventricular myocytes in culture at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h. Treatment with 1 μmol/liter doxorubicin resulted in a significant increase in calpain activity, which occurred as early as 1 h and remained elevated at 48 h (Fig. 2A). The increase in calpain activity was similar to that in cardiomyocytes treated with the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (data not shown). Furthermore, the doxorubicin-induced increase in calpain activity coincided with significant prolongation of the calcium transient and increase in total cytosolic calcium levels, assessed by time constant τ of the fura-2 transient decay and the area under the fura-2 transient curve, respectively (Table II). Caspase-3 activity, on the other hand, did not increase until 24 h of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of myocytes with 100 μmol/liter ALLN prevented the doxorubicin-induced increase in calpain activity at 24 h but had no effect on caspase-3 activity. Conversely, pretreatment with 100 μmol/liter BDFMK prevented the increase in caspase-3 activity at 24 h but did not inhibit calpain activation.Table IIFura-2 calcium transients in cardiomyocytes treated with 1 μmol/liter doxorubicinControl1 h24 h48 hSystolic calcium (fura-2 ratio)1.074 ± 0.0571.082 ± 0.0411.124 ± 0.0491.153 ± 0.079ap < 0.05 versus control.bp < 0.05 versus 1 h.Diastolic calcium (fura-2 ratio)0.938 ± 0.0380.930 ± 0.0440.986 ± 0.078bp < 0.05 versus 1 h.0.955 ± 0.067τ (ms)61.2 ± 14.573.7 ± 14.9ap < 0.05 versus control.122.1 ± 32.2ap < 0.05 versus control.bp < 0.05 versus 1 h.73.8 ± 15.4ap < 0.05 versus control.cp < 0.01 versus 24 h.Total cytosolic calcium (area under the curve)0.0077 ± 0.00370.0115 ± 0.0052ap < 0.05 versus control.0.0150 ± 0.0040ap < 0.05 versus control.0.0231 ± 0.0048ap < 0.05 versus control.cp < 0.01 versus 24 h.a p < 0.05 versus control.b p < 0.05 versus 1 h.c p < 0.01 versus 24 h. Open table in a new tab Calpain-Calpastatin Ratio Is Increased with Doxorubicin—We examined the effect of 24 and 48 h of doxorubicin (1 μmol/liter) treatment on protein levels of calpains-I, -II, and calpastatin. By Western blot, calpain-I appeared as a single 80-kDa band that was significantly decreased at 24 and 48 h of doxorubicin (Fig. 3A). Doxorubicin treatment for 24 h resulted in significant autolysis of the 80-kDa calpain-II band to a higher mobility 78-kDa band, which is widely believed to be the more active form of calpain-II (for review see Ref. 37Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). Calpastatin was significantly decreased at 24 and 48 h of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3A). Because the proteolytic activity of the calpains is negatively regulated by calpastatin, the calpain/calpastatin ratio provides a gauge to assess the proteolytic potential of the calpains (38Ray S.K.

Belcastro A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 241: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ratio of calpain-II (combined 80- and 78-kDa products) to calpastatin was significantly elevated and the increase occurred earlier in comparison to the calpain-I/calpastatin ratio (Fig. 3B). Calpain Degrades Titin in Skinned Cardiomyocytes—To determine whether calpain can directly degrade titin, we incubated Triton-permeabilized myocytes with 10 units/ml of calpain-I (Calbiochem) with or without calpain inhibitor for 30 min. The skinning procedure resulted in some degradation of titin as shown by the T2 band in the control lane (Fig. 4A). Incubation with calpain-I resulted in a more prominent T2 band compared with control, and co-treatment with calpain inhibitor preserved titin to control levels. This effect of calpain on titin integrity was also visualized directly in skinned myocytes immunostained with 9D10, a monoclonal antibody to I-band titin at the PEVK domain (40Wang S.M. Greaser M.L. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1985; 6: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 9D10 immunostaining was reduced in skinned myocytes treated with calpain compared with control myocytes, and this effect was prevented by calpain inhibition (Fig. 4B). Calpain Inhibition Prevents Doxorubicin-induced Myofibrillar Disarray—We examined the pattern of titin staining with 9D10 in myocytes treated with doxorubicin. High resolution images of myocytes stained with antibody 9D10 demonstrated a doublet pattern consistent with staining of the I-bands on either side of the Z-line (Fig. 5A). Myocytes treated with doxorubicin showed an overall decrease in 9D10 staining, along with loss of the doublet pattern (Fig. 5B). Co"
https://openalex.org/W2003825045,"Green tea constituent (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has shown remarkable cancer-preventive and some cancer-therapeutic effects. This is partially because of its ability to induce apoptosis in cancer cells without affecting normal cells. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown the involvement of NF-kappa B pathway in EGCG-mediated cell-cycle deregulation and apoptosis of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Here we show the essential role of caspases in EGCG-mediated inhibition of NF-kappa B and its subsequent apoptosis. Treatment of A431 cells with EGCG (10-40 microg/ml) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B/p65, induction of DNA breaks, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and morphological changes consistent with apoptosis. EGCG treatment of cells also resulted in significant activation of caspases, as shown by the dose- and time-dependent increase in DEVDase activity, and protein expression of caspase-3, -8 and -9. EGCG-mediated caspase activation induces proteolytic cleavage of NF-kappa B/p65 subunit, leading to the loss of transactivation domains, and driving the cells towards apoptosis. EGCG-mediated induction of apoptosis was significantly blocked by the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-FMK), and moderately blocked by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK. Further, pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-FMK was found to suppress the cleavage of NF-kappa B/p65 subunit, thereby increasing nuclear translocation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, thus protecting the cells from EGCG-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these studies for the first time demonstrate that EGCG-mediated activation of caspases is critical, at least in part, for inhibition of NF-kappa B and subsequent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2062708299,"The polarization of eukaryotic cells is controlled by the concerted activities of asymmetrically localized proteins. The PAR proteins, first identified in Caenorhabditis elegans, are common regulators of cell polarity conserved from nematode and flies to man. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins and protein complexes establish cell polarity in mammals. We have mapped multiprotein complexes formed around the putative human Par orthologs MARK4 (microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4) (Par-1), Par-3, LKB1 (Par-4), 14-3-3ζ and η (Par-5), Par-6a, -b, -c, and PKCλ (PKC3). We employed a proteomic approach comprising tandem affinity purification (TAP) of protein complexes from cultured cells and protein sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. From these data we constructed a highly interconnected protein network consisting of three core complex “modules” formed around MARK4 (Par-1), Par-3·Par-6, and LKB1 (Par-4). The network confirms most previously reported interactions. In addition we identified more than 50 novel interactors, some of which, like the 14-3-3 phospho-protein scaffolds, occur in more than one distinct complex. We demonstrate that the complex formation between LKB1·Par-4, PAPK, and Mo25 results in the translocation of LKB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and to tight junctions and show that the LKB1 complex may activate MARKs, which are known to introduce 14-3-3 binding sites into several substrates. Our findings suggest co-regulation and/or signaling events between the distinct Par complexes and provide a basis for further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern cell polarity.

PAR proteins cooperate to convert transient polarity cues into a stable polarized cellular axis by influencing diverse processes like cytoskeletal dynamics or protein degradation (9Pellettieri J. Seydoux G. Science. 2002; 298: 1946-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Cuenca A.A. Schetter A. Aceto D. Kemphues K. Seydoux G. Development. 2003; 130: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). At the one-cell stage, all PAR proteins except PAR-4 exhibit asymmetric localization to the opposite cortices of cells, and a functional hierarchy is inferred from the effect of mutants in each PAR gene on the localization of the other PAR proteins (7Morton D.G. Shakes D.C. Nugent S. Dichoso D. Wang W. Golden A. Kemphues K.J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 241: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Cuenca A.A. Schetter A. Aceto D. Kemphues K. Seydoux G.

The 14-3-3 protein PAR-5 is at the top of this hierarchy, because it is required for the anterior localization of PDZ-domain proteins PAR-3 and PAR-6, which form a complex with PKC3, as well as for the posterior localization of PAR-2 and PAR-1. PAR-1 is at the base, because par-1 mutants have no effect on the localization of other PARs. Whereas nematode PAR-2 has no obvious homolog in other organisms, the other PARs have putative orthologs. However their regulatory hierarchy seems to differ between organisms. In Drosophila, the localization of the PAR-3/PAR-6/PKC complex members is not co-dependent, nor are they, or PAR-5/14-3-3, required for the localization of PAR-1 during oogenesis (14Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Kitamura K. Maniwa R. Nagai Y. Yamashita A. Hirose T. Ishikawa H. Ohno S. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 15Benton R. Palacios I.M. St Johnston D. Dev Cell. 2002; 3: 659-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Later, in the oocyte, PAR-1 becomes dependent on PAR-3 (16Vaccari T. Ephrussi A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1524-1528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There is evidence that PAR-5/14-3-3 may also function downstream of PAR-1 (15Benton R. Palacios I.M. St Johnston D. Dev Cell. 2002; 3: 659-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Drosophila PAR-4/LKB1 partially rescues the par-1 phenotype, suggesting that the two kinases may function in a linear pathway (17Martin S.G. St Johnston D. Nature. 2003; 421: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In mammals, Par-3 and Par-6 have been shown to control polarity in a variety of cell types. Par-6 forms the core of a polarity complex due to its direct interaction with Par-3, aPKC (λ or ζ), the GTPases Cdc42 or Rac, as well as with the tumor suppressor mLgl (18Qiu R.G. Abo A. Martin S.G.

Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, the binding of Par-3 and mLgl to Par-6·aPKC has been shown to be mutually exclusive resulting in opposite functions: Par-6 complexes containing Par-3 promote the formation of tight junctions, whereas complexes containing Lgl suppress them (21Plant P.J. Fawcett J.P. Lin D.C. Holdorf A.D. Binns K. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C.

Biol. 2002; 12: 221-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Par-6 may also be involved in the regulation of tight junctions by interacting with components of the crumbs complex (24Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The role of the Par-6 complex has also been studied in other polarized cell types. In astrocytes, Par-6·aPKCζ is part of a pathway starting from integrins and the subsequent activation of Cdc42, leading to the control of migration. Both Par-6 and aPKC bind directly to glycogen synthase kinase 3β and subsequently regulate the binding of the adenomatous polyposis coli protein to microtubules leading to major reorganization of the cell, whereas Par-3 is not required (25Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 26Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). However, in differentiating neurons, the Par-3·Par-6·aPKC complex is crucial for determining which neurite is selected to become the axon (27Shi S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 2003; 112: 63-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The MARK kinases, which represent the mammalian homologs of PAR-1, were originally identified by their ability to phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), and thus to regulate microtubule stability in cultured cells (28Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 29Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J. Schmitt-Ulms G. Meyer H.E. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7679-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). MARKs were also shown to be necessary for the establishment of polarity in cultured epithelial and neuroblastoma cells (30Bohm H. Brinkmann V. Drab M. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brown A.J. Hutchings C. Burke J.F. Mayne L.V. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The human ortholog of PAR-4 is the serine/threonine kinase LKB1. Mutations in LKB1 cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by gastrointestinal polyps and an increased risk of neoplasms, indicating that LKB1 is a tumor suppressor (32Jenne D.E. Reimann H. Nezu J. Friedel W. Loff S. Jeschke R. Muller O. Back W. Zimmer M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Failure to establish cell polarity may result in inappropriate overgrowth of differentiated cells and cause neoplasms (33Bardeesy N. Sinha M. Hezel A.F. Signoretti S. Hathaway N.A. Sharpless N.E. Loda M. Carrasco D.R. DePinho R.A. Nature. 2002; 419: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Finally, the putative human orthologs of PAR-5, the 14-3-3 family proteins, have like LKB1 not been directly implied in cell polarity, but they are known to exert pleiotropic functions in processes crucial to polarity, e.g. vesicle trafficking (34O'Kelly I. Butler M.H. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 577-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether, in mammalian cells, the PAR proteins operate in a linear hierarchy similar to C. elegans and how they cooperate with other factors involved in polarity. Also it is not clear whether the orthologs of PAR-1 and PAR-4 operate in a protein complex similar to Par-3·Par-6 and how the “cross-talk” between the different polarity complexes is accomplished. In the present study, we employed tandem affinity purification (TAP) combined with liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to map protein complexes around human PAR orthologs. We show that all PAR orthologs form protein complexes and that these complexes share common interactors. Our data allow the construction of a network connecting known and novel players in cell polarity and offer new insight into the molecular mechanisms of morphogenesis. cDNA Cloning—Expression vectors were generated by site-specific recombination (Gateway system, Invitrogen) of PCR-amplified ORFs into modified TAP-, HA-, or myc-tagged versions of the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector pZome1 (Cellzome; available from Euroscarf GmbH). For MARK4, LKB1, Par-6, aPKC, 14-3-3, and PNMA1, the TAP cassette was fused to the N terminus and for Par-3 to the C terminus. The inserted ORFs were subcloned from the following human MGC cDNA clones: aPKC, Image (National Institutes of Health): 4823853; 14-3-3ζ, Image: 2988020; 14-3-3η, Image: 3543571; LKB1, Image: 3689780; PNMA1, Image: 4431875; MARK4, Image: 3874322; MARK2, Image: 3139103; PAPK, Image: 3546243; CDC42 Image: 3626647; Mo25, Image: 4397573; Par-3, Image: 3939370; and Par-6C, Image: 4844008 (RZPD, Berlin, Germany). The Par-6a and b cDNAs were a kind gift of Dr. Ian Macara. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK, ATCC) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Pools of cells expressing epitope-tagged proteins were generated by retroviral gene transfer (35Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). For transient expression, ORFs were fused N-terminally with HA- or myc-epitopes (36Jarvik J.W. Telmer C.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For microscopy, cells were grown on coverslips at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber. Plasmids (300 ng) were transfected into cells grown at 70% confluency using lipofectamin2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed either with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C or with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. After fixation, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with polyclonal anti-HA (Abcam, UK) or monoclonal anti-myc (BD Clontech). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse- or anti-rabbit-labeled with Oregon green or Texas red. DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and cells were imaged using a ×60 objective on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells were collected 48 h after transfection from one 10-cm dish in 400 μl of lysis buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, 125 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4,1mm DTT, Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor tablets). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and used for immunoprecipitation with anti-myc (BD Clontech) or anti-HA resins (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated 3F10 or 9E10 at 1/10,000 (BD Clontech). For kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT). Beads were incubated with 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped with phosphoric acid. The samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and/or spotted onto P81 paper, washed with 8% phosphoric acid, and analyzed by autoradiography. A specific peptide substrate, NVK-SKIGSTENLK was used as substrate for MARK (28Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Tandem Affinity Purification—Cell lysates were incubated with 200 μl of IgG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The beads were collected in 0.8-ml spin columns (MoBiTec) and washed with cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Igepal, 0.5 mm EDTA). The beads were resuspended in cleavage buffer and incubated with 100 units of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 16 °C. The eluate was transferred into a column containing 200 μl of calmodulin-agarose (Stratagene) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Igepal, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm imidazole, 4 mm CaCl2 and after washing with excess buffer the column was eluted with 600 μl of elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EGTA) at 37 °C. The freeze-dried eluates were separated on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Novex) and stained with colloidal Coomassie. Mass Spectrometry—Gels were sliced into 1.25-mm bands across the entire separation range of each lane to sample all potential interacting proteins without bias with respect to size and relative abundance. Cut bands were reduced, alkylated, and digested as described previously (38Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7820) Google Scholar), and peptides were sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, QTOF Ultima and CapLC, Waters) (39Schirle M. Heurtier M.A. Kuster B. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 1297-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Proteins were identified by comparing the mass spectrometry sequence data against an in-house-curated version of the International Protein Index (available at www.ebi.ac.uk/IPI/) using the Mascot software package (Matrix Science, London, UK). Most proteins were unambiguously identified by the sequencing of several independent peptides (Supplemental Material, Table 1). For the few cases in which only one or two peptides supported the identification of a particular protein, we required these peptides to have a Mascot score indicating a <5% probability that the match could be considered a random event (40Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar). In addition, these peptide matches were confirmed by using expressed sequence tags as an alternative search algorithm (41Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). A set of “sticky” proteins typically identified in the majority of TAP purifications, as judged by filtering against a control dataset consisting of more than 400 TAP purifications, were excluded from the analysis. This set includes heat shock proteins, ribosomal proteins, keratins, actin, myosin, and α- and β-tubulins. All experiments were carried out in duplicates. Affinity Purification of Protein Complexes—Using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, we created a panel of HEK293 cell pools expressing TAP-tagged fusions of nine human proteins representing putative orthologs of the C. elegans PAR gene products: MARK4 (C. elegans PAR-1), Par-3, LKB1 (C. elegans PAR-4), 14-3-3η, and ζ (C. elegans PAR-5), Par-6A, Par-6B, Par-6C, and PKCλ (C. elegans PKC3). TAP/MS analysis of the protein complexes formed around these nine proteins was performed from HEK293 cells, because we have assembled a data base that contains more than 5000 protein-protein interactions generated by TAP analysis in this cell line, which allows the reliable assessment of the specificity of a given interaction (data not shown). Expression levels were gauged by varying the multiplicity of infection and were typically 5–10 times over endogenous levels. Expanded cell pools were subjected to tandem affinity purification, a procedure consisting of two specific binding and two specific elution steps under mild conditions, which preserve the integrity of non-transient protein-protein interactions (37Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). The affinity-purified complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained (Fig. 1). The tagged bait proteins represent the most prominent bands on the gel, and in all cases distinct copurifying proteins are present (Fig. 1). Proteins were identified by peptide sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Most proteins were identified by the sequencing of several peptides (Table 1). Details on protein identification procedures are given under “Experimental Procedures.” As a representative example, Fig. 2 shows the identification of two interactors in the LKB1·Par-4 complex, which are identified by sequenced peptides covering 65% (Mo25) and 26% (PAPK) of their total sequence, respectively.Fig. 2Examples of protein identifications: Two novel interactors of LKB1·Par-4.

This complex has been studied extensively by yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analysis (19Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 20Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but to date a mapping of the polarity complex from mammalian cells by comprehensive tagging of the core scaffold proteins has not been reported. We detected the known components Par-6, Par-3, aPKC, and Lgl in all cases (Fig. 1). Cdc42 was detected only in the three TAP-Par-6 purifications and Rac was not found, presumably because the interaction of the small GTPases with Par-6 is transient. As previously reported, we found glycogen synthase kinase 3β to interact with all three Par-6 proteins, albeit only detectable by immunoblotting (data not shown) (26Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2003; 421: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Par-3 and Lgl are thought to bind competitively to the same site on Par-6 (21Plant P.J. Fawcett J.P. Lin D.C. Holdorf A.D. Binns K. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 22Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Nonetheless low amounts of Lgl were detected, judged by low sequence coverage, in the TAP-Par-3 purification. Although it has been previously reported that Lgl2 does not bind to Par-6C (22Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we found it to be present abundantly in TAP-Par-6C. Notably, each Par-6 paralog was also found to be in complex with the two other paralogs. Because they do not bind directly to each other (19Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), this suggests the presence of higher order complexes. Several new interactors of the Par-6 polarity complex were identified (Table 1 and Figs. 1E and S1). Hensin, a large protein involved in the terminal differentiation of epithelia, was found in TAP-Par-6B (Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material) and several proteins lacking functional annotation were found in TAP-Par-6C, including a protein related to Drosophila Spaghetti, a microfilament-binding protein involved in cytokinesis. In TAP-PKCλ, several novel interacting proteins were identified in addition to the known Sequestosome protein (42Sanz L. Sanchez P. Lallena M.J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1F and Table 1). However, because these interactors were not found by tagging of the other polarity complex members, it is likely that they are involved in PKCλ functions distinct from the control of polarity. Unexpectedly, we found MARK2, another homolog of C. elegans PAR-1, in the TAP-Par-6A purification, and its paralog MARK4 was identified with TAP-aPKCλ, suggesting molecular cross-talk between the Par-6 polarity complexes and MARK·Par-1 complexes. We found several more components shared between the different polarity complexes: 14-3-3 proteins, which represent homologs of C. elegans PAR-5, were found with TAP-Par-3, and PNMA1, a marker for paraneoplastic syndrome, was identified with TAP-Par-3, TAP-14-3-3, and TAP-MARK4 (Fig. 1), but not with any other protein in our HEK293 dataset (data not shown). Reciprocally, we identified Par-3 and PKCλ in a TAP-PNMA1 complex (Fig. S2 in the Supplemental Material). TAP Analysis of MARK4·Par-1 Complexes—The homologs of C. elegans PAR-1 are protein serine kinases conserved from yeast to man (28Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 43Drewes G. Nurse P. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mammalian MARK·Par-1 family comprises four closely related gene products. In flies, PAR-1 has been reported to interact with 14-3-3 proteins (15Benton R. Palacios I.M. St Johnston D. Dev Cell. 2002; 3: 659-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This interaction is conserved, because we find several different 14-3-3 proteins in TAP-MARK4. 14-3-3 proteins are known to occur as homo- and heterodimers in cells and hence can serve as bridging factors. By co-immunoprecipitation it appears that MARK4 and MARK2 interact mainly with 14-3-3η, whereas Par-3 interacts mainly with 14-3-3ζ (see Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material). In total, the analysis of TAP-MARK4 resulted in the unambiguous identification of 20 interacting proteins (Fig. 1A). Among these, PKCλ, and cdc42 are components of the Par-6 polarity complex, and homologs of transforming growth factor-β-induced anti-apoptotic factor and 14-3-3 have been implicated in cell polarity. Transforming growth factor-β-induced anti-apoptotic factor may be an ortholog of Miranda, a protein that is associated with centrosomes and is involved in neuroblast asymmetric division in Drosophila (44Mollinari C. Lange B. Gonzalez C. Biol. Cell. 2002; 94: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly MARK4 also associates with centrosomes and microtubules (45Trinczek B. Brajenovic M. Ebneth A. Drewes G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5915-5923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several interactors appear to be associated with the cytoskeleton; e.g. ARHGEF2, microtubule-associated exchange factor for Rac and Rho GTPases. We also find the microtubule-associated phosphatase 2A associated with TAP-MARK, which has been, like MARK·Par-1 itself, implicated in the regulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau (46Sontag E.

FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase implicated in integrin signaling during cell migration. Here we identify a direct interaction between N-WASP and FAK and show that N-WASP is phosphorylated by FAK at a conserved tyrosine residue, Tyr256. We found that phosphorylation of Tyr256 affected N-WASP nuclear localization, suggesting that phosphorylation of N-WASP by FAK may regulate its activity in vivo by altering its subcellular localization. We also showed that the nuclear localization of N-WASP is dependent on its being in the open conformation either after its activation by Cdc42 or the truncation of the C-terminal VCA domain. Phosphorylation of Tyr256 of N-WASP could reduce its interaction with nuclear importin NPI-1, which might be responsible for its decreased nuclear localization. Lastly, we show that phosphorylation of Tyr256 plays an important role in promoting cell migration. Together, these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of N-WASP by tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization and its potential role in the regulation of cell migration.

Together, these results suggest a novel regulatory mechanism of N-WASP by tyrosine phosphorylation and subcellular localization and its potential role in the regulation of cell migration. Cell migration plays an essential role in many biological processes such as embryogenesis, wound repair, angiogenesis, inflammatory immune response, and cancer metastasis (1Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3277) Google Scholar, 2Christopher R.A. Guan J.L. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 575-581PubMed Google Scholar). Cell migration is a complex multistep process that involves protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, formation of adhesion complexes, myosin/actin-mediated cell contraction, and the release of adhesions at the cell rear. Consistent with the complexity of the cell migration process, a variety of intracellular signaling molecules and their associated biochemical pathways have been identified in the regulation of this process. Members of the Rho subfamily of small G proteins (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) modulate cell migration by affecting the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 4Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While Rho stimulates formation of stress fibers necessary for actin-myosin mediated cell contraction (5Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar), Rac and Cdc42 regulate lamellopodia and filopodia formation, respectively, during the initiation of cell migration (6Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3733) Google Scholar). The driving force for the formation of these protrusive structures is actin polymerization regulated by the actin nucleation machinery such as the Arp2/3 complex (7Welch M.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 423-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The Arp2/3 complex is activated by the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) 1The abbreviations used are: WASP, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; NLS, nuclear localization signal; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; mAb, monoclonal antibody; VCA, verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, acidic; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding; GBD, G protein binding domain. family of proteins through direct binding of their conserved verprolin-homology, cofilin-homology, acidic (VCA) domain to the Arp2/3 complex (8Rohatgi R.

The WASP family member N-WASP is an effector of Cdc42 mediated regulation of actin cytoskeleton and filopodia formation. Binding of Cdc42 to the Cdc42/Rac1 interactive binding (CRIB) motif within the G protein binding domain (GBD) of N-WASP releases it from an autoinhibitory conformation, which exposes its VCA domain allowing it to activate the Arp2/3 complex (8Rohatgi R.

Lim W.A. Science. 2000; 290: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in signaling by integrins and other cell surface receptors, plays an important role in the regulation of cell migration (10Parsons J.T. Martin K.H. Slack J.K. Taylor J.M. Weed S.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 11Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Schlaepfer D.D. IUBMB Life. 2002; 53: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). FAK-/- fibroblasts derived from FAK-knockout mouse embryos exhibit a significant decrease in cell migration compared with the cells from wild-type mice (12Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). In addition, inhibition of FAK by overexpression of FRNK (a dominant-negative FAK fragment) decreases cell spreading and migration (13Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 14Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of FAK in a number of cell lines including the FAK-/- cells promotes their migration on fibronectin (15Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Fry D.W. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4806-4818Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of downstream signaling pathways have been identified to mediate FAK-stimulated cell migration. One such pathway involves FAK complex formation with Src and subsequent phosphorylation of the adaptor molecule Cas by the FAK/Src complex (15Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Another pathway involves interactions between FAK and PI3 kinase and the adaptor molecule Grb7 (19Reiske H.R. Kao S.C. Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Lai J.F. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 20Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Despite success in identifying these and other potential FAK downstream signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell migration, the mechanisms by which FAK signaling connects to the cellular machinery in motility are still poorly understood. To further explore potential mechanisms of FAK regulation of cell migration, we searched for interactions between FAK and proteins involved in the regulation of actin polymerization by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays. In this study, we show a novel interaction between FAK and N-WASP and demonstrate FAK-dependent phosphorylation of N-WASP at Tyr256. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subcellular localization of N-WASP is dependent on its activation state and that phosphorylation of Tyr256 of N-WASP can regulate its subcellular localization by affecting N-WASP interaction with nuclear importin, NPI-1. Lastly, we provide evidence that phosphorylation of N-WASP and its consequent increased localization in the cytoplasm increased the ability of N-WASP to stimulate cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that FAK may promote N-WASP function by regulating its subcellular localization, which may be involved in the regulation of cell migration by FAK. Antibodies—The mouse mAb 12CA5 (α-HA) and rabbit antiserum α-KC against FAK have been described previously (21Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibody against GST were prepared from anti-GST serum using GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose as an affinity matrix. The mouse monoclonal α-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and the mouse monoclonal α-vinculin antibody were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).

Soriano and were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS. 293 cells, COS7 cells, and CHO cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% CS. Tet-off CHO cell lines that overexpress HA tagged N-WASP or N-WASP Y256F mutant were generated using plasmids pTet-Splice-HA-N-WASP and pTet-Splice-HA-N-WASP-Y256F (see below) essentially as described (21Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 1 μg/ml tetracycline to suppress exogenous gene expression until experiments as indicated.

The same PCR product was digested with SmaI and EcoRI, and then inserted into linearized mammalian expression vector pKH3, pHAN (27Han D.C. Shen T.L. Miao H. Wang B. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) at the corresponding sites to generate pKH3-N-WASP, pHAN-N-WASP, and pDHGST-N-WASP, respectively. The rat N-WASP H208D mutant has been described previously (29Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev.

The Y256F and Y256D mutant constructs were made by overlapping PCR mutagenesis as described previously (18Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) using pEGFP-N-WASP as the template and the primers: N-WASP-reverse, N-WASP-forward, 5′-gaaac atcaa aagt atatt cgact tcatt gaaaa aac-3′ (Y256F-F) and 5′-gtttt ttcaa tgaag tcgaa tataa ctttt gatgt ttc-3′ (Y256F-R), and N-WASP-reverse, N-WASP-forward, 5′-gaaac atcaa aagtt ataga cgact tcatt gaaaa aac-3′(Y256D-F), 5′-gtttt ttcaa tgaag tcgtc tataa cttt tgatgt ttc-3′(Y256D-R), respectively. PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and ligated with linearized pEGFP-C3 vector with HindIII and EcoRI sites at both ends to generate plasmids pEGFP-N-WASP-Y256F, pEGFP-N-WASP-Y256D, respectively. The fragment encoding N-WASP-Y256F was excised from pEGFP-N-WASP-Y256F with SmaI and EcoRI, and ligated with linearized pHAN or pKH3 vector with SmaI and EcoRI sites at ends to generate plasmids pHAN-N-WASP-Y256F and pKH3-N-WASP-Y256F. The cDNA fragments encoding N-WASP or N-WASP-Y256F together with the N-terminal HA tag sequence were excised from pKH3-N-WASP or pKH3-N-WASP-Y256F with SalI and ClaI and ligated to the corresponding sites of pTet-Splice vector (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate pTet-Splice-HA-N-WASP and pTet-Splice-HA-N-WASP-Y256F. N-WASP truncation mutant ΔVCA was made by PCR using pEGFP-N-WASP as a template and primers N-WASP-forward and 5′-cggaa ttctt aagag cagga caccg gccg-3′ (deltaVCA3). Double mutants ΔVCAY256F and ΔVCA-Y256D were made by PCR similarly except that pEGFP-N-WASP-Y256F and pEGFP-N-WASP-Y256D were used as templates, respectively. Four N-WASP fragments encoding residues 1-148 (N-WASP1), 148-273 (N-WASP2), 267-400 (N-WASP3), and 393-C terminus (N-WASP4) were made by PCR using primers: N-WASP-forward and 5′-cggaa ttctt atctt ttctc agatt tcctt tgtcg-3′(148-REV), 5′-ccccc aagct tggcc cgggg agacg agacc cccca aatgg tcc-3′(148-FOR) and 5′-cggaa ttctt atcgc agttc atttt taaca gcttc-3′(273-REV), 5′-ccccc aagct tggcc cgggg gttaa aaatg aactg cgaag g-3′ (267-FOR) and 5′-cggaa ttctt atgga acttg gtggt cacca tc-3′(400-REV), and 5′-ccccc aagct tggcc cgggg ccttc tgatg gtgac cacca agttc c-3′(VCAF) and N-WASP-reverse, respectively.

The fragment of WASP2 is also inserted into the pGEX-2T vector to generate pGEX-N-WASP2. pCDNA3-Cdc42L61 and pCDNA3-Cdc42N17 were generous gifts of Dr. Richard Cerione of Cornell University. Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins containing two different importin α, pGEX-Flag-Rch1, and pGEX-Flag-NPI-1, were generous gifts of Dr. Toshihiro Sekimoto (Osaka University). Nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For most experiments, subconfluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin). For experiments to detect in vivo phosphorylation of N-WASP, 0.5 mm pervanadate was used in lysis buffer instead of sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitor. Pervanadate was made as described previously (30Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 mm sodium vanadate was mixed with 20 mm H2O2 (1:1), then incubated at room temperature for 10-15 min before adding to lysis buffer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C, and total protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad Protein Assay. GST fusion proteins were precipitated by incubating cell lysates with glutathione agarose beads for 120 min at 4 °C. After washing five times with lysis buffer, complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with appropriate antibodies as indicated for more than 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for another 2 h with protein A-Sepharose. After washing, immune complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody and the Amersham Biosciences ECL system for detection. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Recombinant His-tagged N-WASP was kind gift of Dr. H. Miki (University of Tokyo). His-tagged FAK were purified from Sf21 insect cell lysates that had been infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding the His-tagged FAK (kind gift of Dr. F. Matsumura of Rutgers University), as described previously (31Withers B.E. Keller P.R. Fry D.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 1996; 7: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These two recombinant proteins were incubated in the kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MnCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4) with or without 100 μm ATP for 20 min at room temperature. The kinase reactions were then stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. After boiling for 5 min, the samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractionation—Fractionation was performed essentially as described (32Lin S.Y. Makino K. Xia W. Matin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hung M.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, then lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 units ml-1 aprotinin) and homogenized by a tightly fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to sediment nuclei. The supernatant was then resedimented at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant formed the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer and resuspended in the same lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl to extract nuclear proteins. The extracted material was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was harvested as the nuclear fraction. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and in Vitro Binding Assays—GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as described previously (19Reiske H.R. Kao S.C. Cary L.A. Guan J.L. Lai J.F. Chen H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12361-12366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins (20 μg) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with different amount of recombinant His-tagged FAK (0.6-10 μg) in 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The amount of bound FAK was quantified by densitometry. In other experiments, recombinant Cdc42 loaded with GTPγS (30 μg) was used in the in vitro binding assays with FAK (1 μg) and GST fusion proteins (20 μg). The bound proteins were analyzed with Western blotting with polyclonal anti-FAK α-KC (1:1000) or anti-Cdc42 (1:500). GST-importin protein pull-down experiments were performed similarly except that 293 cell lysates from cells that had been transfected with pEGFP-N-WASP or its mutants were used to bind the immobilized GST fusion proteins. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed with immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. Pyrene Actin Assays—His-tagged N-WASP (0.5 μg) was incubated with recombinant FAK (1 μg) or GST-Fyn (1 μg) in 10 μl of phosphorylation reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 3 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.2) for 60 min at 37C. The reaction mixture was then diluted into 100 μl of XB (buffer for pyrene actin assay, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA), and Arp2/3 complex (final concentration 60 nm) and 10% labeled actin (final concentration 2 μm) was added. The polymerization was monitored as described previously (29Suetsugu S. Hattori M. Miki H. Tezuka T. Yamamoto T. Mikoshiba K. Takenawa T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 645-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fluorescent Microscopy—Cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (21Zhao J.H. Reiske H. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1997-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-N-WASP (1:50), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:300; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) was used as the secondary antibodies. In other experiments, live cells that had been transiently transfected with vectors encoding GFP fusion proteins were observed directly by fluorescent microscopy. In some experiments, the fluorescent intensity in the nuclear (Fn) and cytoplasmic (Fc) parts of the cells was quantified using the NIH Image J program. The ratio of Fn-Fc versus Fc was then calculated and used to quantify nuclear localization of the proteins. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays for tet-off CHO cells were performed as described previously (28Han D.C. Rodriguez L.G. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on 35-mm tissue culture dish in complete growth media. After cells reached confluency, wounds were generated by manual scraping of the cell monolayer with a pipette tip. The dishes were then washed, replenished with media, and photographed using a phase contrast microscope. They were then placed in the tissue culture incubator, and the matched wound regions were photographed again 6 or 8 h later. In other experiments, cell migration assays for transiently transfected FAK-/- cells were performed using image analysis as described previously (20Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), except that plasmids encoding GFP-N-WASP or GFP-Y256F mutant was used instead of a vector encoding GFP in some experiments. Association of FAK with N-WASP—To investigate a potential interaction between FAK and N-WASP, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments of the two endogenous proteins. Cell lysates were prepared from NIH 3T3 cells and immunoprecipitated by antibodies against N-WASP, and the immune complexes were subjected to Western blotting with anti-FAK to detect associated FAK. Fig. 1A shows the presence of FAK in anti-N-WASP immunoprecipitates, but not in the control immunoprecipitates. Conversely, immunoprecipitation using anti-FAK, but not the control IgG, also brought down N-WASP in the immune complex (Fig. 1B). These results suggest a specific association of endogenous FAK with N-WASP. To determine the N-WASP binding site on FAK, we co-expressed a Myc-tagged N-WASP with HA-tagged wild-type FAK or several FAK mutants in 293 cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti-HA antibody, followed by Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2A). As expected, N-WASP was co-precipitated with the wild-type FAK, but not the empty pKH3 vector. It was also co-precipitated with the Y397F mutant, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is not required for the association. The N-terminal domain of FAK (residues 1-400) showed strong binding to N-WASP, whereas the kinase domain or the C-terminal domain of FAK showed little or no binding. A similar strategy was used to define the FAK-binding site within N-WASP by co-expression of HA-tagged FAK with GST-tagged N-WASP fragments in 293 cells. Fig. 2C showed that FAK associated with the N-WASP fragment containing the Basic and GBD domains (residues 148-273), but not the other fragments corresponding to the WH1, proline-rich, or VCA domains (see Fig. 2B). Together these results suggested that FAK interaction with N-WASP is mediated by the N-terminal domain of FAK and N-WASP residues 148-273, respectively. To determine whether the interaction between these two molecules is direct or not, we prepared a GST fusion protein containing the N-WASP residues 148-273 (GST-N-WASP2) in bacteria and a His-tagged recombinant FAK protein from insect Sf21 cells. As shown in Fig. 2D, recombinant FAK bound to immobilized purified GST-N-WASP2 in a dose-dependent manner, but did not bind to GST alone control. These results suggested that FAK was capable of interacting with N-WASP directly. Because Cdc42 also binds to the same region of N-WASP as FAK, we examined whether inclusion of purified Cdc42 could affect association of FAK and N-WASP using the in vitro binding assays. Recombinant FAK was incubated with immobilized GST-N-WASP2 in the presence or absence of His-tagged recombinant Cdc42 prepared from Sf9 insect cells and loaded with GTPγS. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Fig. 2E shows that, as expected, Cdc42 bound to GST-N-WASP (middle panel) and that it did not affect FAK binding to GST-N-WASP (top panel). Staining of the same membrane with Ponceau S showed similar expression levels of the fusion proteins in all samples (bottom panel). These results suggested that Cdc42 did not affect FAK association with N-WASP.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4589-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine whether N-WASP is a substrate for FAK, we first tested whether purified FAK can phosphorylate N-WASP in vitro. Fig. 3A shows that incubation of purified FAK with recombinant His-tagged N-WASP led to its phosphorylation in the presence of ATP (middle lanes), but not in the absence of ATP (left lanes). This phosphorylated band was not observed when FAK alone was incubated with ATP (right lanes), suggesting that this is not a FAK degradation product, which co-migrated with His-tagged N-WASP. Co-expression of FAK, but not its kinase-defective mutant, with N-WASP also induced tyrosine phosphorylation of N-WASP in 293 cells, suggesting that N-WASP is also a substrate for FAK in vivo (Fig. 3B). The Y397F mutant also induced N-WASP phosphorylation, although to a lesser extent than the wild-type FAK. This could be due to a reduced kinase activity of the Y397F mutant because phosphorylated Tyr397 is a binding site for Src family kinases that can subsequently further activate FAK (37Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, this could be due to a lack of additional phosphorylation of N-WASP by the associated Src family kinases. However, phosphorylation of N-WASP by FAK is also observed in SYF cells that are deficient in the expression of Src family kinases Src, Yes, and Fyn (23Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2145828848,"αB-crystallin, a major component of the vertebrate lens, is a chaperone belonging to the family of small heat shock proteins. These proteins form oligomers that bind to partially unfolded substrates and prevent denaturation. αB-crystallin in cardiac muscle binds to myofibrils under conditions of ischemia, and previous work has shown that the protein binds to titin in the I-band of cardiac fibers (Golenhofen, N., Arbeiter, A., Koob, R., and Drenckhahn, D. (2002) <i>J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol.</i> 34, 309–319). This part of titin extends as muscles are stretched and is made up of immunoglobulin-like modules and two extensible regions (N2B and PEVK) that have no well defined secondary structure. We have followed the position of αB-crystallin in stretched cardiac fibers relative to a known part of the titin sequence. αB-crystallin bound to a discrete region of the I-band that moved away from the Z-disc as sarcomeres were extended. In the physiological range of sarcomere lengths, αB-crystallin bound in the position of the N2B region of titin, but not to PEVK. In overstretched myofibrils, it was also in the Ig region between N2B and the Z-disc. Binding between αB-crystallin and N2B was confirmed using recombinant titin fragments. The Ig domains in an eight-domain fragment were stabilized by αB-crystallin; atomic force microscopy showed that higher stretching forces were needed to unfold the domains in the presence of the chaperone. Reversible association with αB-crystallin would protect I-band titin from stress liable to cause domain unfolding until conditions are favorable for refolding to the native state."

Here we report that activation of the host Raf-MEK-ERK-cPLA2 signaling cascade is required for the chlamydial uptake of host glycerophospholipids. Both the MAP kinase pathway (Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK) and Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) were activated in chlamydia-infected cells. The inhibition of cPLA2 activity resulted in the blockade of the chlamydial uptake of host glycerophospholipids and impairment in chlamydial growth. Blocking either c-Raf-1 or MEK1/2 activity prevented the chlamydial activation of ERK1/2, leading to the suppression of both chlamydial activation of the host cPLA2 and uptake of glycerophospholipids from the host cells. The chlamydia-induced phosphorylation of cPLA2 was also blocked by a dominant negative ERK2. Furthermore, activation of both ERK1/2 and cPLA2 was dependent on chlamydial growth and restricted within chlamydia-infected cells, suggesting an active manipulation of the host ERK-cPLA2 signaling pathway by chlamydiae.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7233-7242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian cell glycerophospholipids, which contain straight chain fatty acids, chlamydial phospholipids possess branched chain fatty acids. Isoleucine is the precursor of the α-keto acid primer needed to initiate branched chain fatty acid biosynthesis in prokaryotes. Chlamydia-specific glycerophospholipids contain straight carbon chain fatty acids at their Sn1 but branched carbon chain fatty acids at the Sn2 position, indicating that chlamydiae take up and modify host glycerophospholipids. Obviously, a prerequirement of such modification is liberation of the free fatty acid at the Sn2 position of the host phospholipids, which is achieved through hydrolysis as catalyzed by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). However, no phospholipase A2 homologues have been identified in chlamydial genomes (23Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan J. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Olinger L. Tatusov R.L. Zhao Q.

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), including both Ca2+-dependent cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) and Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2). The cPLA2 activity can be inhibited by either chemical inhibitors (e.g. AACOCF3) or Ca2+ depletion. The activation of cPLA2 requires phosphorylation at multiple sites, which can be carried out by various upstream kinases including the MAP kinase ERK1/2 (36Hiller G. Sundler R. Cell.

Here we demonstrate that both MAP kinase ERK1/2 and cPLA2 are activated during chlamydial intracellular replication, and inhibition of either leads to suppression of chlamydial uptake of the host glycerophospholipids and chlamydial replication. Cell Culture and Chlamydial Infection—HeLa, 293T (ATCC, Manassas, VA), and MS-74 (endometrial epithelial primary cells kindly provided by Dr. John Alderete from the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (catalog number 11995-065, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in an incubator supplied with 5% CO2. The Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 (434/Bu) organisms obtained from Dr. C. Kuo at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA) were grown, purified, and titrated as described previously (39Zhong G.M. Peterson E.M. Czarniecki C.W. de la Maza L.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 283-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of chlamydial organisms were stored at -80 °C. The infection was carried out by diluting the chlamydial organisms in growth medium and applying the inocula onto the cell monolayers grown either in 35-mm tissue culture dishes or on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. The infectious dose was used at a multiplicity of infection of 5 or as indicated in individual experiments. The infected cells were cultured at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for various times as indicated in the individual experiments. For cultures treated with inhibitors, all of the chemical inhibitors were added to the cultures 2 h after infection and maintained throughout the experiments. The inhibitors GW5074 (for inhibiting Raf-1, Tocris Cookson Ltd., Bristol, UK), U0126 (for MEK1/2, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), AACOCF3 (for cPLA2, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), BEL (for iPLA2, Calbiochem), BAPTA/AM (cell membrane-permeable Ca2+ chelator, Sigma), and BAPTA (extracellular Ca2+ chelator, Sigma) were used at the concentrations indicated in individual experiments. For transfection, plasmids encoding either wild type ERK2 or dominant negative ERK2 were used to transfect 293T cells (ATCC) 24 h prior to chlamydial infection as described previously (40Chen L.Y.

The epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma) was used at 100 ng/ml for 5 min as a positive control for activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway. At the end of the incubation period, the cultures were processed or harvested for analysis as described below. For Western blot analysis, the cells were harvested with a SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, Sigma), 50 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (Sigma) at pH 6.8). For titrating inclusion-forming units (IFUs), the cultures were sonicated in sucrose:phosphate:glutamine buffer (pH 7.2), and the cell lysates, after serial dilution, were inoculated onto fresh HeLa monolayers. Western Blot Assay—The Western blot assays were carried out as described previously (42Zhong G. Reis e Sousa C. Germain R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13856-13861Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell culture samples were lysed with a SDS sample buffer, and the lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel separation. After the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, primary antibodies were applied. These include mouse monoclonal antibodies to cPLA2 and ERK1 (both from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), Ras (Upstate USA, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), chlamydial major outer membrane protein (clone MC22), 2H.

The primary antibody binding was probed with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) followed by standard ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The kinase activity of ERK1/2 in chlamydia-infected cells was measured with a recombinant ELK-1 as the substrate in a cell-free assay system following the instruction described in the manufacturer's manual (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The level of GTP-bound Ras in chlamydia-infected cells was detected using immunoprecipitation with glutathione-agarose beads bound with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 glutathione S-transferase fusion protein following the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate USA, Inc.). Immunofluorescence Assay—For immunofluorescence staining (29Zhong G. Fan P. Ji H. Dong F. Huang Y. J. Exp.

For localizing pERK1/2 or p-cPLA2, the cell samples were co-stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody to pERK1/2 or a rabbit antiserum to p-cPLA2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). After washing away the unbound first antibodies, the appropriate secondary antibody conjugate combinations (consisting of a goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated with Cy2 (green), goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated with Cy3 (red) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and Hoechst dye (blue for DNA, Sigma)) were used to visualize the first antibody staining. The triply stained cell samples were used for image acquisition with an Olympus AX-70 fluorescence microscope. The images were acquired a single color at a time using a Hamamatsu digital camera and superimposed with the software SimplePCI. For titrating IFUs, the chlamydia-infected cultures were singly stained for chlamydial inclusion as described above. The number of inclusions was counted (five random fields/coverslip) under a fluorescence microscope and expressed as IFU/ml of the sonicated cell lysates. Incorporation of Radiolabeled Adenine into C. trachomatis DNA—C. trachomatis growth was assessed by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled [2,8-3H]adenine (23 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into parasite-specific DNA. Labeling conditions, cell harvesting, and quantitation of radiolabel incorporated into the DNA were conducted as described previously (21McClarty G. Tipples G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabel was added at 20 h postinfection when C. trachomatis DNA synthesis is at a maximum, and cultures were harvested 3 h later. All results were normalized to 106 cells. Extraction and Purification of Lipids—For radiolabeling of phospholipids, C. trachomatis-infected cells were incubated with 3 μCi/5-cm dish radiolabeled l-[U-14C]isoleucine (342 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) beginning at 20 h postinfection. After 6 h of incubation, the cell monolayer was washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 2 ml of methanol:water (1:1, v/v). The lipids were extracted and separated by a two-dimensional TLC procedure, which gave good separation of all the major phospholipids (32Hatch G.M. McClarty G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12443-12451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organic phase containing the extracted lipids was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 100 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). A 50-ml aliquot, with appropriate standards, was placed on a 10-× 10-cm thin-layer Silica Gel 60 plate (Whatman) that had been treated previously with 0.4 m boric acid. The plates were developed in the first dimension with chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (70:30:3:2) and in the second dimension with chloroform:methanol:water (65:35:5). Individual lipids were visualized with iodine vapor. Areas corresponding to individual lipids were removed and placed in vials containing Universol scintillation fluor (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) for quantitation by scintillation counting (Beckman LS500). The results were standardized based on the number of milligrams of protein/dish. Protein was assayed (44Dawson J.M. Heatlie P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 140: 391-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. cPLA2 Is Activated during Chlamydial Infection and Required for Chlamydial Uptake of Host Glycerophospholipids—To evaluate whether host cPLA2 is activated following chlamydial infection, we monitored the extent of phosphorylation of cPLA2 during the entire course of chlamydial infection (Fig. 1A). There was a basal level of cPLA2 phosphorylation in HeLa cells in the absence of chlamydial infection (Fig. 1A, 0 h, top panel). However, the level of phosphorylated cPLA2 was significantly higher in HeLa cells infected with chlamydiae for 12 h and continued to increase as the infection progressed. As the sample loading control, the total amount of cPLA2 was monitored and showed no significant difference between cell samples (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We next used a cPLA2-specific inhibitor, AACOCF3, to test whether activation is required for the chlamydial uptake of host glycerophospholipids. As shown in Fig. 1B, AACOCF3 dramatically reduced chlamydial uptake of host PE, PG, PC, PS, PI, and CL. Furthermore, AACOCF3, but not BEL (an iPLA2-specific inhibitor), significantly reduced chlamydial growth as assessed by the incorporation of radiolabeled adenine into parasite DNA (Fig. 1C) and production of infectious elementary bodies as measured by quantitating the number of infectious particles recovered (Fig. 1D). Because the activity of cPLA2 requires Ca2+, we next determined the effects of Ca2+ depletion on the chlamydial uptake of host glycerophospholipids. As shown in Fig. 1E, the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA/AM was as efficient as AACOCF3 (see Fig. 1B) in reducing the amount of host lipids trafficked to chlamydiae. The intracellular calcium depletion also inhibited chlamydial growth (Fig. 1F). In contrast, chelating extracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA had no obvious effect on chlamydial growth (Fig. 1F, open circles). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that chlamydial infection is accompanied by activation of cPLA2, and the activated cPLA2 is required for the chlamydial salvage of host glycerophospholipids. We next investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for cPLA2 activation during chlamydial infection. Activation of the MAP Kinase Signaling Pathway during Chlamydial Infection Is Required for cPLA2 Phosphorylation and Chlamydial Uptake of Host Glycerophospholipids—Because one of the upstream kinases for activating cPLA2 is ERK, we tested whether ERK1/2 is also activated during chlamydial infection. As shown in Fig. 2A, although the control HeLa cells showed a minimal level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, the cells infected with chlamydiae for 12 h displayed a dramatically higher level of phosphorylated ERK1/2, and the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation continued to increase as the infection progressed (Fig. 2A, top panel). The phosphorylated ERK1/2 harvested from the chlamydia-infected samples was measured for kinase activity using ELK-1 fusion protein as the substrate (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). The kinase activity of ERK1/2 correlated well with the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The total ERK1/2 protein was measured in parallel, and no significant difference in the levels of total ERK1/2 protein was noted between samples (Fig. 2A, middle panel). We used the inhibitor U0126 to test whether the chlamydia-activated ERK1/2 is required for cPLA2 activation during chlamydial infection. U0126 selectively targets MEK1/2, and MEK1/2 are the direct upstream kinases of ERK1/2 (45Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). As expected, U0126 effectively inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, top panel). An obvious inhibition of the chlamydia-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed with 2-10 μm U0126. Consequently, cPLA2 phosphorylation was also proportionally inhibited in the same set of samples (Fig. 2B, third panel), whereas neither the total ERK1/2 (Fig. 2B, second panel) nor cPLA2 (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) protein level was significantly altered by the inhibitor. These data indicate that the chlamydia-activated ERK1/2 is responsible for the activation of cPLA2 during chlamydial infection. As expected, the inhibition of cPLA2 with U0126 also blocked the chlamydial uptake of host glycerophospholipids (Fig. 2C, top panel) and growth (bottom panel) in a dose-dependent manner. We also used a transfection approach to demonstrate the role of ERK1/2 in chlamydial activation of cPLA2 in 293T cells (Fig. 2D). Cells transfected with a dominant negative (DN) ERK2, but not the wild type (WT) ERK2 construct, displayed a minimal level of cPLA2 phosphorylation regardless of chlamydial infection, which independently confirms that cPLA2 is activated in chlamydia-infected cells by the MAP kinase ERK1/2. After demonstrating the chlamydial activation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2-cPLA2 in two different tumor cell lines, we next tested the chlamydial activity in the primary endometrial epithelial cells MS-74 (Fig. 2, E and F). Chlamydial infection induced significant phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and cPLA2 during the entire infection course, although EGF only activated ERK1/2 but not cPLA2 (Fig. 2E). More importantly, the chlamydia-induced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and cPLA2 was inhibited by U0126, an irreversible inhibitor of MEK1/2 (Fig. 2F), indicating that chlamydial activation of cPLA2 in the MS-74 primary cells is also dependent on chlamydial activation of MEK1/2. We next evaluated whether the upstream steps of MEK1/2 are activated during chlamydial infection (Fig. 2, G and H). We found that the level of c-Raf-1 phosphorylated at Tyr-340 was increased as the infection progressed (Fig. 2G, third panel from top), whereas the total Raf-1 level remained similar regardless of infection (Fig. 2G, second panel from top). The Raf phosphorylation correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2G, bottom panel), suggesting the involvement of Raf in chlamydial activation of MEK/ERK. Interestingly, the level of GTP-bound Ras, a small GTPase required for Raf-1 phosphorylation in many cases, was also increased during chlamydial infection (Fig. 2G, top panel). More importantly, a c-Raf-1 inhibitor (GW5074) significantly inhibited chlamydia-induced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 (Fig. 2H, second panel from top), ERK1/2 (fourth panel from top), and cPLA2 (Fig. 2H, bottom panel), whereas the total protein level of the corresponding molecules remained the same (Fig. 2H, top, third, and fifth panels), demonstrating the necessity of Raf-1 in the chlamydial activation of cPLA2. Activation of ERK1/2 and cPLA2 Is Dependent on Chlamydial Growth—So far we have demonstrated that the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is required for cPLA2 activation in chlamydia-infected cells. However, it is not known how MEK1/2-ERK1/2 itself is activated during chlamydial infection. We found that activation of both ERK1/2 and cPLA2 correlated well with chlamydial infection dose, and as infection doses increased, higher levels of ERK1/2 and cPLA2 phosphorylation were detected (Fig. 3A), which suggests that chlamydial replication is involved in activating these host signaling molecules. To evaluate whether chlamydial protein synthesis is required for the ERK1/2 and cPLA2 activation during chlamydial infection, we assessed the effects of antibiotics that selectively block either chlamydial protein synthesis or chlamydial particle assembly on host ERK1/2 and cPLA2 activation (Fig. 3B). Both rifampin (able to inhibit prokaryotic transcription) and chloramphenicol (able to prevent prokaryotic translation) successfully blocked chlamydial protein synthesis (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). Consequently, the levels of both phosphorylated ERK1/2 and cPLA2 were dramatically suppressed in chlamydia-infected cultures treated with either rifampin or chloramphenicol (Fig. 3B, top panel and third panel from the top). However, penicillin G, known to interfere with chlamydial reticulate body replication and reticulate body to el"
https://openalex.org/W2081036615,"Many cases of breast cancer show loss of estrogen receptor (ER) α expression, which leads to unresponsiveness to antihormonal treatment even though there is no loss of the structurally and biochemically similar ER β. ER activity is positively and negatively regulated by transcriptional regulators such as histone deacetylase (HDAC), which is known to be a negative ER regulator. Here, we evaluated using ER β as an alternative target for tamoxifen therapy by treating ER α-negative, β-positive breast cancer cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), and testing whether tamoxifen responsiveness increased following upregulation of ER β. TSA enhanced the overall ER transcriptional activity in these cells, as visualized by estrogen response element-regulated reporter and the expression of progesterone receptor, a known ER target, without ER α restoration. Additionally, TSA induced the expression and nuclear translocation of ER β but not α, suggesting that these actions leading to increase of ER transcriptional activity are mediated through ER β rather than α. Furthermore, following treatment with TSA, the formerly unresponsive MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T breast cancer cells became responsive to tamoxifen. However, reduction of ER β expression by short interfering RNA abrogated this TSA-induced sensitization effect in these cells. Together, these results show that the HDAC inhibitor TSA sensitized ER α-negative, antihormone-unresponsive breast cancer cells to tamoxifen treatment possibly by upregulating ER β activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032055223,"Here we identified two novel proteins denoted EH domain protein 2 (EHD2) and EHD2-binding protein 1 (EHBP1) that link clathrin-mediated endocytosis to the actin cytoskeleton. EHD2 contains an N-terminal P-loop and a C-terminal EH domain that interacts with NPF repeats in EHBP1. Disruption of EHD2 or EHBP1 function by small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing inhibits endocytosis of transferrin into EEA1-positive endosomes as well as GLUT4 endocytosis into cultured adipocytes. EHD2 localizes with cortical actin filaments, whereas EHBP1 contains a putative actin-binding calponin homology domain. High expression of EHD2 or EHBP1 in intact cells mediates extensive actin reorganization. Thus EHD2 appears to connect endocytosis to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions of its N-terminal domain with membranes and its C-terminal EH domain with the novel EHBP1 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2118999235,"We have shown that the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) product 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid increases monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells (EC) in vitro. Recent studies have implicated 12/15-LO in mediating atherosclerosis in mice. We generated transgenic mice on a C57BL/6J (B6) background that modestly overexpressed the murine 12/15-LO gene (designated LOTG). LOTG mice had 2.5-fold elevations in levels of 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and a 2-fold increase in expression of 12/15-LO protein in vivo. These mice developed spontaneous aortic fatty streak lesions on a chow diet. Thus, we examined effects of 12/15-LO expression on early events leading to atherosclerosis in these mice. We found that, under basal unstimulated conditions, LOTG EC bound more monocytes than B6 control EC (18 ± 2 versus 7 ± 1 monocytes/field, respectively; p < 0.0001). Inhibition of 12/15-LO activity in LOTG EC using a 12/15-LO ribozyme completely blocked monocyte adhesion in LOTG mice. Thus, 12/15-LO activity is required for monocyte/EC adhesion in the vessel wall. Expression of ICAM-1 in aortic endothelia of LOTG mice was increased severalfold. VCAM-1 expression was not changed. In a series of blocking studies, antibodies to α4 and β2 integrins in WEHI monocytes blocked monocyte adhesion to both LOTG and B6 control EC. Inhibition of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and connecting segment-1 fibronectin in EC significantly reduced adhesion of WEHI monocytes to LOTG EC. In summary, these data indicate that EC from LOTG mice are “pre-activated” to bind monocytes. Monocyte adhesion in LOTG mice is mediated through β2 integrin and ICAM-1 interactions as well as through VLA-4 and connecting segment-1 fibronectin/VCAM-1 interactions. Thus, 12/15-LO mediates monocyte/EC interactions in the vessel wall in atherogenesis at least in part through molecular regulation of expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. We have shown that the 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LO) product 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid increases monocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells (EC) in vitro.

Other mechanisms contributing to the atherogenicity of 12/15-LO include the enzyme's ability to oxidize lipids and lipoproteins in the vasculature and the ability of its eicosanoid products to mediate monocyte adhesion to the endothelium.

To understand the mechanisms by which 12/15-LO-generated eicosanoids modulate events leading to atherogenesis in vivo, we produced transgenic mice that modestly overexpressed the murine 12/15-LO gene.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13979-13987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic clone also comprises ∼7 kb upstream and 2 kb downstream of the murine 12/15-LO gene to include additional proximal promoter and enhancer elements. The genomic clone was excised from λFIXII (Stratagene) using NotI and injected into C57BL/6J mouse blastocysts. Two founder lines were generated: 16F and 41F. Mice from both founder lines were viable and fertile. We have not observed phenotypic differences between male and female LOTG mice. The genotyping strategy for these mice utilized the T7 and T3 polymerase sites located just inside the NotI restriction site of the genomic clone (Fig. 1A). The following primers were used to identify positive mice: T7 (5′-ctctaatacgactcactata-3′) and T7409 (5′-tgttgaccaaatcaccgaga-3′); and T3 (5′-caattaaccctcactaaagg-3′) and T3271 (5′-atgccaccctacagaaatgcta-3′). The T7/T7409 primers yield a 420-bp PCR product; the T3/T3271 primers yield a 333-bp product. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s; with a final extension time of 5 min at 72 °C. Results of the genotyping for the founder mice using the T3/T3271 and T7/T7409 primers are shown in Fig. 1B. From the founder mice, these PCR products were sequenced and found to correspond to the 12/15-LO genomic clone sequence. Southern analysis of genomic DNA from C57BL/6J control mice and 16F and 41F transgenic mice showed increased 12/15-LO copy number in both transgenic lines compared with the control line (Fig. 1C). The full-length mouse 12/15-LO cDNA was used as a probe for Southern analysis. In some studies, we used 12/15-LO knockout mice on a C57BL/6J background (21Funk C.D. Chen X.S. Johnson E.N. Zhao L. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These mice were a kind gift of Dr. Colin D. Funk (University of Pennsylvania). Eicosanoid Measurement in Urine—Lipids were extracted from urine as described previously using Varian C18 Bond-Elut columns in series (10Hatley M.E. Srinivasan S. Reilly K.B. Bolick D.T. Hedrick C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25369-25375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 8S-HETE was added as an internal standard. The fluorescence derivatives of the free fatty acids were formed using 8 mg of 2-(2,3-naphthalimino)ethyltrifluoromethanesulfonate dissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixtures were dried with nitrogen, resuspended in 0.4 ml of acetonitrile, diluted with 0.6 ml of water, and applied to a third Bond-Elut column. The fatty acid derivatives were eluted with 0.6 ml of ethyl acetate, evaporated under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 μl of methanol for HPLC analysis. HPLC separation and analysis were performed using a Waters C18 symmetry column and eluting isocratically for 100 min in 61% solvent B (solvent B = 50% methanol/tetrahydrofuran + 0.1% acetic acid, and solvent A = 0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min following related protocols of Roman and co-workers (22Maier K.G. Henderson L. Narayanan J. Alonso-Galicia M. Falck J.R. Roman R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H863-H871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peaks were detected fluorometrically at an excitation wavelength of 259 nm and an emission wavelength of 394 nm. The area ratio of sample HETE area to internal standard (8-HETE) area was plotted against nanograms of HETE injected, and unknown sample HETE values were calculated from their area ratios. HETEs (5,12,15-HETE) and HODEs (9,13-HODE) were base line-separated using this elution protocol. HETE and HODE measurements in urine were normalized to grams of creatinine. Fig. 2 illustrates the HPLC elution profile of HETE and HODE standards (panel A) as well as representative HPLC chromatograms from B6 control and LOTG mice (panel B). Aortic Atherosclerosis Measurements—Male C57BL/6J mice and male mice from the 41F line (8 weeks old) were fed a rodent chow diet for 20 weeks. After 20 weeks, mice were euthanized. The organs were perfused with 10% formalin. The intact aorta from the heart to the iliac artery (∼3 mm from the bifurcation) was removed. The adventitia was removed, and the aorta was pinned and stained with Sudan IV. Quantification of aortic lesion area was performed according to the methods of Daugherty and Whitman (23Daugherty A. Whitman S.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 209: 293-309PubMed Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis of Endothelial Adhesion Molecule Expression—Mouse EC at passage 4 were collected in phosphate-buffered saline by gentle scraping using a cell scraper. Cells (150,000/sample) were analyzed for each antibody. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with a 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled primary antibodies for mouse adhesion molecules (FITC-labeled anti-mouse ICAM-1, BD Biosciences catalog no. 553252; and FITC-labeled anti-mouse VCAM-1, BD Biosciences catalog no. 553332) or isotype control antibodies (FITC-labeled hamster IgG1, BD Biosciences catalog no. 553971; and FITC-labeled rat IgG2a, BD Biosciences catalog no. 553929). After incubation, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in paraformaldehyde. Samples were analyzed at the University of Virginia Flow Cytometry Core using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer. FITC fluorescence was collected in the FL1 channel through a 530/30-nm band-pass filter. Analyses were performed using FL1 channel histograms, from which the mean fluorescence intensity channel was calculated for each sample. Isolation of Mouse Aortic Endothelial Cells—Aortic EC from C57BL/6J, LOTG, and 12/15-LO knockout (designated LOKO) mice were harvested from mouse aortas under sterile conditions following the methods outlined previously (24Srinivasan S. Yeh M. Danziger E.C. Hatley M.E. Riggan A.E. Leitinger N. Berliner J.A. Hedrick C.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mouse EC cultures were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 60 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 100 μg/ml heparin and were used in experiments from passages 2 to 5. Mouse Monocyte Adhesion Assay—We have recently developed a monocyte adhesion assay that utilizes primary mouse aortic EC (MAEC) and WEHI 78/24 cells. WEHI 78/24 cells are a mouse monocyte cell line that has been fully characterized by McEvoy and co-workers (25Tsao P.S. McEvoy L.M. Drexler H. Butcher E.C. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2176-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 26McEvoy L.M. Sun H. Tsao P.S. Cooke J.P. Berliner J.A. Butcher E.C. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 2069-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). WEHI monocytes were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. MAEC from C57BL/6J, LOTG, and LOKO mice were used in adhesion assays as described previously (24Srinivasan S. Yeh M. Danziger E.C. Hatley M.E. Riggan A.E. Leitinger N. Berliner J.A. Hedrick C.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). As a positive control for monocyte adhesion, MAEC were incubated with either 250 μg/ml oxidized LDL or 10 units/ml recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (R&D Systems catalog no. 410-MT) for 4 h. Oxidized LDL was prepared as described previously (28Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Wong H. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 563-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). For studies using blocking antibodies or peptides, WEHI cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with CS-1 peptide (EILDVPST; 750 μg/ml), anti-α4 integrin antibody (PS/2; 20 μg/ml), anti-β2 integrin antibody (GAME-46; 20 μg/ml), or an isotype control antibody prior to adding to MAEC for adhesion assays. In some studies, anti-VCAM-1 antibody (MK2.7; 20 μg/ml) to block endothelial VCAM-1, anti-ICAM-1 antibody (YN1.1; 20 μg/ml) to block endothelial ICAM-1, or isotype control antibody was added to EC for 4 h at 37 °C. To block 12/15-LO activity in EC, MAEC were infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors, AdRZ (expresses 12/15-LO ribozyme) or an AdLacZ control, at a multiplicity of infection of 50 for 48 h (30Patricia M.K. Natarajan R. Dooley A.N. Hernandez F. Gu J.L. Berliner J.A. Rossi J.J. Nadler J.L. Meidell R.S. Hedrick C.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), or the pharmacological inhibitor CDC (10 μm) was added to MAEC for 4 h at 37 °C prior to performing a monocyte adhesion assay. Immunoblotting for 12/15-LO Protein—MAEC from B6 control and LOTG mice were harvested in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Inc.) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 75 μg of total EC protein was analyzed by 4-12% SDS-PAGE in MOPS running buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose. Pierce BLOTTO buffer was used as a blocking agent. Membranes were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody to murine 12/15-LO. 12/15-LO protein was detected using a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescence. Bands were normalized to tubulin (1:5000 dilution of antibody) and quantitated by densitometry. Mouse Monocyte Isolation—Whole blood was obtained via retro-orbital bleeding from 15 heterozygous CX3CR1-GFP mice. These mice were generated by replacing the coding region of CX3CR1 (the fractalkine receptor) with GFP. Thus, these mice express GFP only in monocytes and in a subset of natural killer cells. GFP expression in the monocytes allowed us to purify monocytes using sterile fluorescence cell sorting. To isolate the monocytes, whole blood was collected into heparin and diluted with an equal volume of 0.9% saline. 6 ml of diluted blood was carefully layered over 3 ml of NycoPrep one-step 1.077/265 animal separation solution into 15-ml tubes. Blood was centrifuged at 600 × g for 15 min. Mononuclear cells were harvested from the interface between the plasma layer and the NycoPrep solution. Mononuclear cells were washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution, centrifuged at 400 × g for 15 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks’ balanced salt solution. For cell sorting, monocytes were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with allophycocyanin-labeled anti-NK1.1 antibody to label natural killer cells. After incubation, cells were rinsed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution, resuspended in 1 ml of Hanks’ balanced salt solution, and sorted using a BD Biosciences FACSVantage SE™ cell sorter by forward and side scatter gating for monocytes (Fig. 3A) and then selecting for GFPhi/NK1.1lo-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). Monocyte recovery was only ∼50%; however, purity based upon morphology was >92%. For the adhesion assay, isolated mouse monocytes were labeled with calcein O,O′-diacetate tetrakis(acetoxymethyl) ester according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 20,000 monocytes/well were incubated with MAEC for 45 min at 37 °C. Unbound monocytes were rinsed, and adherent monocytes localized within a 10 × 10 grid at ×40 magnification were counted by epifluorescence microscopy. Quantitative Real-time PCR for Murine ICAM-1 and Murine 12/15-LO—Organ tissues were collected from control and LOTG mice from the 41F line and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 12/15-LO mRNA measurements. MAEC were freshly isolated from aortas and cultured as described above in 100-mm cell dishes for 12/15-LO mRNA and ICAM-1 mRNA measurements. Total cellular RNA was obtained from either MAEC or frozen tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription of 2 μg of total RNA was performed in a total volume of 25 μl using Thermoscript RT (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. The RNA was treated with DNase I at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA. For quantitative PCR analysis, the resulting cDNA was diluted 1:5, and 2 μl was used for each PCR. Reagents from the QIAGEN real-time PCR kit containing SYBR Green were used for quantitative PCRs. The PCR conditions for ICAM-1 were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 4 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by a final extension at 81 °C for 15 s. For 12/15-LO and cyclophilin, the PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min; 95 °C for 4 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by a final extension at 81 °C for 15 s. The primers for murine 12/15-LO were 5′-ctctcaaggcctgttcagga-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtccattgtccccagaacct-3′ (reverse). The primers for murine ICAM-1 were 5′-agatcacattcacggtgctg-3′ (forward) and 5′-cttcagaggcaggaaacagg-3′ (reverse). The primers for murine cyclophilin were 5′-tggagagcaccaagacagaca-3′ (forward) and 5′-tgccggagtcgacaatgat-3′ (reverse). Data were analyzed and are presented based upon the relative expression method (31Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref Scopus (121290) Google Scholar). This formula for calculation is follows: relative expression = 2-(SΔCT-CΔCT), where ΔCT is the difference in threshold cycle between the gene of interest (either 12/15-LO or ICAM-1) and the housekeeping gene (cyclophilin), S is LOTG mice, and C is B6 control mice. Statistical Analyses—Comparisons between groups were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are represented as the means ± S.E. of eight mice (unless otherwise noted in the figure legends). All comparisons were made using Fisher’s Least Significant Difference procedure so that multiple comparisons were made at the 0.05 level only if the overall F-test from ANOVA was significant at p < 0.05. 12/15-LO Transgenic Mice Have Increased Levels of 12S-HETE and 13S-HODE in Vivo—LOTG mice had significant elevations in levels of urinary 12S-HETE and 13S-HODE, the primary eicosanoid products of the 12/15-LO enzyme (Fig. 4). Levels of 12S-HETE were increased from 200 ng/g of creatinine in B6 control mice to 500 ng/g of creatinine in LOTG mice (41F line) (p < 0.0001). Levels of urinary 13S-HODE were found to be 10 ng/g of creatinine in B6 control mice and 50 ng/g of creatinine in LOTG mice (41F line) (p < 0.0001). Levels of urinary 12S-HETE and 13S-HODE were also elevated in mice from the 16F line (289 ng/g of creatinine for 12S-HETE and 17 ng/g of creatinine for 13S-HODE; p < 0.001), although the increase in eicosanoid production in this transgenic line was much more modest. Overall, there was no apparent shunting to the 5-LO pathway in the LOTG mice, as 5S-HETE levels in LOTG mice remained similar to B6 control levels. We have previously reported that 5S-HETE does not induce monocyte adhesion to the endothelium (20Patricia M.K. Kim J.A. Harper C.M. Shih P.T. Berliner J.A. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Hedrick C.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Tissue distribution of 12/15-LO mRNA in LOTG mice was normal, with expression found in aorta, brain, heart, kidney, liver, and pancreas. Expression of 12/15-LO mRNA was increased 2-fold in aorta, liver, and pancreas and 3-4-fold in brain, heart, and kidney of LOTG mice compared with B6 mice (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Tissue distribution of 12/15-LO in control and transgenic mice. Tissues were harvested from B6 control and LOTG line 41F (TG) mice and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR for 12/15-LO was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All values were normal"
https://openalex.org/W1991976042,"p120-catenin exists in a membrane-associated cadherin-bound pool, a cytosolic pool that affects Rho GTPases, and a nuclear pool that is thought to associate with the methylation-relevant transcriptional repressor Kaiso. We show here that cytoplasmic p120 can also associate both directly and indirectly with the microtubule network, and that p120 traffics along microtubules toward their plus ends. The direct binding required most of the armadillo repeats and was mutually exclusive for interaction with E-cadherin. Perturbing the p120-microtubule interaction with nocodazole or taxol markedly affected both the tubulin interaction and the balance between cytoplasmic and nuclear p120. The indirect binding occurred via a novel interaction between a segment of the p120 N-terminal domain and conventional kinesin heavy chains. Selective uncoupling of the p120-kinesin interaction by overexpression of the respective p120 and kinesin-binding fragments promoted nuclear p120 accumulation. In addition, expression of full-length kinesin reduced the nuclear accumulation of p120 and blocked the branching phenotype associated with p120 overexpression. Taken together, the data suggest that kinesin affects both the targeting and activity of p120 at several cellular locations. p120-catenin exists in a membrane-associated cadherin-bound pool, a cytosolic pool that affects Rho GTPases, and a nuclear pool that is thought to associate with the methylation-relevant transcriptional repressor Kaiso.

Taken together, the data suggest that kinesin affects both the targeting and activity of p120 at several cellular locations. Cadherins are cell-cell adhesion proteins that have critical roles in development, morphogenesis, and cancer (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 2Yap A.S. Cancer Investig. 1998; 16: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Nollet F. Berx G. Roy F.V. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Their extracellular domains interact with one another in homophilic fashion, whereas their intracellular domains associate with cytoplasmic proteins termed catenins. α- and β-catenins constitute a physical linkage between the so-called catenin binding domain of cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton (3Nollet F. Berx G. Roy F.V. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, p120-catenin (hereafter p120) binds to the juxtamembrane domain and does not directly associate with the cytoskeleton (4Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that p120 is regulated by phosphorylation and acts as a switch that modulates cadherin adhesiveness (4Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin), 1The abbreviations used are: E-cadherin, epithelial cadherin; KHC, kinesin heavy chains; KLC, kinesin light chains; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; MAP, microtubule-associated protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; pAb, polyclonal antibody; CMV, cytomegalovirus; NES, nuclear exclusion signal; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. the main adhesion molecule in epithelial tissues, is frequently down-regulated or lost altogether during the transition to metastatic cancer (2Yap A.S.

In E-cadherin-deficient cells, p120 is stranded in the cytoplasm where its role is uncertain. When overexpressed in normal cells, p120 saturates available cadherin-binding sites and floods the cytoplasm. High level p120 overexpression induces a dramatic branching morphology that has been attributed to inhibition of RhoA (5Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and is independent of cadherin function. Low level overexpression promotes cell motility, which may involve the activation of Rac1 (6Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 7Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cytoplasmic pools of p120 affect cell morphology and motility through modulation of Rho-GTPases. These observations have led to the hypothesis that cytoplasmic pools of p120 in cadherin-deficient carcinomas may contribute to the metastatic phenotype (7Grosheva I. Shtutman M. Elbaum M. Bershadsky A.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 695-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). An enhanced nuclear pool of p120 in cadherin-deficient cells (9van Hengel J. Vanhoenacker P. Staes K. van Roy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7980-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 10Mayerle J. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Schnekenburger J. Weiss F.U. Zimmer K.P. Domschke W. Lerch M.M. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) could also contribute to these effects. Thus, like many other Arm repeat proteins, p120 appears to have roles at many locations, including cell-cell junctions, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus. Mechanisms associated with the trafficking of p120 to and from these various locations have not been examined. Microtubules are polarized structures; during interphase they radiate through the cytoplasm with a minus end attached to the centrosome and a plus end oriented toward the cell periphery. Free microtubule ends undergo dynamic instability, switching between growing and shrinking phases or pausing. Microtubules that stay in pause for longer periods do not show tubulin turnover and are referred to as stable microtubules. In addition to contributing to structural rigidity, microtubules are utilized by specific molecular motors to traffic proteins, vesicles, and organelles within a cell. Conventional kinesin is one of these molecular motors that is ubiquitously expressed and uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport cargoes toward the plus ends of microtubules (11Miki H. Setou M. Kaneshiro K. Hirokawa N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7004-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). It is a heterotetramer of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC) and two light chains (KLC) that function together to promote cargo movement. Here we have identified several novel functional interactions between p120 and microtubules. One mode of interaction is likely direct and was competed by cadherin overexpression. Additionally, p120 associated with microtubules indirectly via a novel interaction with conventional kinesins, which promoted the movement of p120 toward the plus ends of microtubules. We have mapped the reciprocal binding sites on these proteins, and we used the interacting fragments to selectively interfere with p120-kinesin binding and function. The data suggest that kinesin affects both the targeting and activity of p120 at several cellular locations. These observations reveal novel physical and functional relationships between microtubules, p120, and kinesin that are likely to impact on the role of p120 in cell adhesion and tumor progression. Cell Culture and Transfections—All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, cells were plated onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates, incubated overnight, and transfected with a total of 4 μg of various expression plasmids per well, using the transfection reagent cytofectene (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s directions. In all experiments, 2 μg of p120 expression vectors were co-transfected with either 2 μg of control vector or 2 μg of cadherin cytoplasmic domain constructs, 1 μg of KHC together with 1 μg of control vector, 1 μg of KHC together with 1 μg of KLC, or 1 μg of KHC together with 1 μg of N1 or N3. For immunoprecipitation and mapping studies, 293 cells in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 16 μg of DNA using the calcium phosphate method. Immunoprecipitations—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (12Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K. Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Matrisian L. Bundy L.M. Sealy L. Gilbert B. van Roy F. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). All antibodies were used at 5 μg/500-μl sample for immunoprecipitations. For Western blotting, the 9E10 anti-Myc and 12CA5 anti-HA mAbs were used at 1 μg/ml final concentration. Similarly, the p120 mAbs 6H11 and 8D11 were used at 1 μg/ml, whereas pp120 (Transduction Laboratories) was used at 0.25 μg/ml. The anti-kinesin mAb H2 (Chemicon Inc.) was used at 1:1,000 final dilution. Goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase was used as the secondary antibody at 1:20,000. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence localization procedures have been described in detail (13Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K.

Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and incubated with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were the following: F1αSH (14Wu J. Mariner D.J. Thoreson M.A. Reynolds A.B.

The secondary antibodies used were highly cross-absorbed goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 (green; Molecular Probes) or 596 (red), goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (green) or 596 (red), and goat anti-rat Alexa 596 (red) used at 1:600. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc.) and visualized under a Nikon Optiphot 2 fluorescent microscope using a ×60 planApo Nikon objective. Photos were acquired with the Metamorph program using a CoolSnap Fx CCD camera and compiled in Photoshop and Powerpoint. Yeast Two-hybrid—The Hollenberg mouse embryo cDNA library (E10.5) was used to screen for p120-interacting proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed as described in detail elsewhere (15Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-p120 was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (5Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). GST-p120 on glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) was subjected to digestion with Factor Xa (8 units for 1 h at 22 °C) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated for 2 h with an excess of glutathione beads to remove uncut p120-GST. Recombinant p120 was then concentrated in general tubulin buffer (Cytoskeleton Inc.) using Amicon filters and used immediately in microtubule-associated protein spin-down assays. Microtubule-associated Protein Spin-down Assays—293 cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of PEM buffer (80 mm PIPES (pH 6.9), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF. Cell lysates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to remove any microtubules. Clarified lysates were then used for microtubule spin-down assays using a commercially available kit (BK029) from Cytoskeleton Inc. Microtubules were assembled from highly purified tubulin protein (>99% pure; Cytoskeleton Inc.). Briefly, 2.5 μl of cushion buffer (PEM buffer containing 50% glycerol) was added to 20-μl aliquots of tubulin (100 μg of protein dissolved in PEM buffer containing 1 mm GTP), prior to incubation at 35 °C for 20 min. Newly formed microtubules were then stabilized by the addition of 180 μl of PEM buffer containing 20 μm Taxol (final microtubule concentration approximately equivalent to 10 nm). Microtubule binding reactions were performed by adding 20 μl of clarified cell lysate to 20 μl of microtubules in the presence of 10 μl of PEM containing 20 μm Taxol. Controls included microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) used as a positive control, BSA as a negative control, as well as the lack of microtubules to test for nonspecific precipitation. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, samples were added on top of a 100-μl cushion buffer supplemented with Taxol and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at room temperature. Protein in the pellets and the supernatants was denatured and solubilized by boiling in 1× LSB buffer, prior to SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, protein was visualized by Coomassie staining (MAP2 and BSA controls), or in the case of p120 it was visualized after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting with the anti-p120 mAb 8D11 at 1 μg/ml. The assay was essentially identical when recombinant p120 was used, with the exception that instead of cell lysate samples were loaded with ∼1 μg of purified, recombinant p120. Constructs—The Rc-CMV-murine p120ctn isoforms 1A, 3A, 4A, and 1A-HA (epitope tagged) have been described previously (12Ireton R.C. Davis M.A. van Hengel J. Mariner D.J. Barnes K.

The Rc-CMV-Δ(Arm) mutant, which lacks amino acids 392-821 of p120-1A, is identical to the ΔR3-11-HA p120 mutant described before (18Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Finally, KIF-HA was generated by subcloning the p120-interacting KIF5C fragment from the pVP16 vector into pcDNA3-HA (16Fujita Y. Krause G. Scheffner M. Zechner D. Leddy H.E. Behrens J. Sommer T. Birchmeier W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) using NotI digestion and confirming the sequence by sequencing. The identity of all other constructs was also verified by sequencing. Live Cell Imaging—Goldfish fibroblasts (line CAR) were cultured and transfected as described (21Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cy3 tubulin was kindly provided by Fedor Severin (Dresden, Germany) and microinjected using a Leitz Micromanipulator M and Eppendorf Microinjector 5242. Video microscopy was performed as described in detail elsewhere (21Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Supplemental Material—One figure and three movies are included as Supplemental Material. The figure shows the rapid and reversible association of p120 with dynamic microtubules. The first two movies show the co-localization and temporal association of p120-GFP with dynamic microtubules, respectively, and the third movie shows p120-GFP sliding along microtubule tracks. p120 Co-localizes with Microtubules—Ectopically expressed p120 (murine isoform 1A) exhibited a prominent filamentous staining pattern in 28% of transfected MDCK cells (see Fig. 1A), which co-localized with microtubules but not other elements of the cytoskeleton (not shown). The same staining pattern was observed after immunostaining with several different p120 antibodies, and with an epitope tag antibody (mAb12CA5) after expression of HA-tagged p120. Similar observations were made in several different cell lines, including NIH3T3, COS7, and MCF7 cells (not shown). Treatment of MDCK cells with the microtubule-depolymerizing agent nocodazole (10 μm, 90 min) disrupted the p120 filamentous staining (Fig. 1B). In addition, although most of the endogenous cytoplasmic p120 in cadherin-deficient cancer cells exhibited a diffuse staining pattern, co-localization of p120 with microtubules could be clearly observed in well spread cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that p120 interacts directly or indirectly with microtubules. To examine further the behavior of p120 on microtubules, we expressed p120-GFP in fish fibroblasts (CAR line) and observed its localization in real time by live cell imaging. p120-GFP was frequently observed along microtubules decorated with Cy3-tubulin (see Supplemental Material, movie 1). Interestingly, cytosolic p120 bound rapidly to newly polymerized, dynamic microtubules (see Supplemental Material, movie 2). This association seems to be a regulated process as p120 can be seen to rapidly associate and dissociate with dynamic microtubules (Supplemental Material, Fig. 1 and movie 2). In agreement with this hypothesis, treatment of p120-overexpressing MDCK cells with staurosporine (50 nm), a general PKC inhibitor, significantly increased the number of cells exhibiting filamentous p120 staining (∼82% of p120-overexpressing cells), whereas dimethyl formamide used as a vehicle control had no effect. p120 Associates with Polymerized Tubulin in Vitro—To validate biochemically the interaction of p120 with microtubules, we attempted to co-precipitate ectopically expressed p120 from 293 cell lysates using a highly purified preparation of polymerized microtubules (Fig. 2A). Under these conditions, p120 and microtubules efficiently co-precipitated, but we could not distinguish between direct and indirect binding. Therefore, the experiment was repeated using purified recombinant p120. Fig. 2B shows that even highly purified preparations of p120 and microtubules co-precipitated, suggesting that p120 can bind microtubules directly. The Binding of p120 to Cadherins or Microtubules Is Mutually Exclusive—Preliminary structure-function analysis demonstrated that co-localization with microtubules required extensive regions of p120, including the alternatively translated N-terminal region between p120 ATG start sites 3 and 4 (amino acids 103-324) and armadillo repeats 3, 5, and 7-10 (immunofluorescence data not shown). To determine whether overlapping elements within the armadillo repeats mediate mutually exclusive binding interactions with either E-cadherin or microtubules, we co-expressed p120 with the cadherin cytoplasmic domain ΔCYTO (Fig. 3). ΔCYTO expression strongly inhibited p120 co-localization with tubulin, suggesting that p120 cannot bind directly to tubulin and E-cadherin at the same time. As control, the experiment was repeated with a p120 mutant lacking armadillo repeat 1 (p120ΔA1), which cannot bind to cadherins. ΔCYTO did not block the microtubule localization of the p120ΔA1 mutant. p120 Can Associate with Microtubules Indirectly via Kinesin—p120-GFP found in the cytoplasm of ectopically expressing cells aligned along microtubules and often exhibited directional movement (Fig. 4A and Supplemental Material, movie 3). The movement of p120-GFP was primarily toward the microtubule plus ends, although movement toward the minus ends was also observed in some cases (data not shown). The direction of p120 anterograde movement on microtubules was both toward areas of intercellular contact and toward cell-free edges. 2M. Yanagisawa, I. N. Kaverina, A. Wang, Y. Fujita, A. B. Reynolds, and P. Z. Anastasiadis, unpublished observations.Fig. 4A, p120 slides along microtubules. Goldfish fin fibroblasts were transiently transfected with p120-GFP and 2 days later microinjected with Cy3-tubulin. After incorporation of Cy3-tubulin into the microtubule network, double fluorescence images were captured every 10 s as described previously (21Kaverina I. Krylyshkina O. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Cells with low level expression of p120 were chosen for analysis. p120-GFP (labeled green and pointed out by a V) can be seen moving along a microtubule track (red) toward the plus end (also see Supplemental Material, movie 3). B, p120 associates with kinesin heavy chains. [1] 293 cells were transfected with wild type murine p120 with or without an HA-tagged truncation construct of KIF5C. The same construct was shown to interact with p120 in a yeast two-hybrid screen (not shown). HA-tagged immunoprecipitates (IP) were generated, divided in half, and Western-blotted (WB) for either p120 (using mAb pp120) or HA-tag (using 12CA5; not shown). p120 was specifically co-precipitated by 12CA5, but not an irrelevant nonspecific mAb (NS), which was used as a control. [2] 293 cell lysates (overexpressing murine p120) were immunoprecipitated with the murine-specific mAb 8D11 and Western-blotted for kinesin (using mAb H2). Endogenous kinesin was co-precipitated by the p120-specific mAb but not by an irrelevant nonspecific mAb (NS). [3] 293 cell lysates (overexpressing murine p120) were immunoprecipitated with the kinesin-specific mAb H2 and Western-blotted for p120 (using mAb pp120). p120 was co-precipitated with endogenous kinesin by the kinesin-specific mAb H2 but not by an irrelevant nonspecific mAb (NS). Finally, [4] 293 cells were co-transfected with p120 and pcDNA3 or p120 and Myc-tagged KHC (full-length isoform 5B). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated either with the Myc tag-specific mAb 9E10 or with the kinesin-specific mAb H2 and Western-blotted for p120 (using mAb pp120). p120 was selectively co-precipitated in KHC-transfected cells but not in cells transfected with the control pcDNA3 vector, although p120 expression was equivalent in both cases (not shown). C, co-localization of p120 and kinesin. MDCK cells were co-stained for p120 and kinesin heavy chain using the anti-p120 pAb F1αSH and the kinesin-specific mAb H2. In addition to prominent cytoplasmic peri-nuclear staining, kinesin can also be found localizing at cell-cell junctions of confluent MDCK cells, where it co-localizes with p120. In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, kinesin co-localizes with p120 in small cytoplasmic dots (some of them highlighted by an open circle in the panels). Individually obtained confocal images were combined using Adobe Photoshop to generate a combined image.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The plus-ended movement of p120 along microtubules suggested that p120 interacts with microtubule-associated motor proteins. The first evidence that this may be the case came from a yeast two-hybrid screen for p120-interacting proteins, where a portion of KIF5C (a conventional kinesin motor protein) was shown to interact with a p120 construct in the pBTM bait vector. KIF5C is a brain-specific member of the kinesin heavy chain family that mediates plus-ended movement when associated in a heterotetrameric complex with kinesin light chain (KLC). The yeast two-hybrid interaction with KIF5C (266.6 arbitrary units of β-galactosidase activity) was as strong as that with VE-cadherin (228.4 units), a known p120 partner. Meanwhile, the interaction between an empty vector and KIF5C was not detectable (0.0 units). To validate this potential interaction, p120 was co-immunoprecipitated from 293 cell lysates with a tagged version of the KIF5C fragment isolated previously in the yeast two-hybrid screen (KIF-HA containing amino acids 654-757 of KIF5C; Fig. 4B-1). When the cytosolic pool of p120 was increased by ectopic p120 expression in 293 cells, endogenous kinesin heavy chain co-precipitated with p120 (Fig. 4B-2), and p120 was co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous kinesin (Fig. 4B-3). In all cases, these proteins were not present in immunoprecipitates generated with control mAbs. Finally, ectopic p120 co-precipitated with overexpressed full-length kinesin heavy chain isoform 5B (KHC; kinesin; see Fig. 4B-4), an isoform found in most cells. Interestingly, ectopically expressed p120 co-precipitated with kinesin even in lysates of cells pretreated with nocodazole (10 μm, 90 min; data not shown), indicating that the interaction is not mediated by intact microtubules. These data strongly argue that p120 interacts with kinesin in cells. In further support of this interaction, we observed co-localization at cell-cell contacts of endogenous p120 and kinesin in confluent MDCK epithelial cell cultures (Fig. 4C). In addition, co-localization of p120 and kinesin in cytoplasmic dots, especially around the nucleus, was evident in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 4C) and sparsely plated MDCK cells (not shown). These data suggest that p120 may be delivered to sites of cell-cell contact by kinesin-mediated trafficking. Kinesin Associates with the Alternatively Spliced p120 N Terminus—To map the kinesin interaction site on p120, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays with an extensive panel of naturally occurring p120 isoforms and targeted deletion mutants (Fig. 5A). Interaction with kinesin did not require the p120 Arm repeat domain or C terminus (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the N-terminal end is required because the naturally occurring p120 isoform 4, which lacks the N-terminal 323 amino acids due to alternative splicing, does not bind kinesin (Fig. 5B). p120 isoform 3 (lacks 102 N-terminal amino acids) co-precipitated weakly with kinesin, indicating that the interaction occurs, in part, through sequences located between ATG start sites 3 and 4 (which correspond to the start of isoforms 3 and 4, respectively). However, in repeated experiments, the co-immunoprecipitation with p120 isoform 1 was significantly stronger than that with isoform 3, suggesting that amino acids 1-102 of p120, altho"
https://openalex.org/W1993216883,"Unfettered hyaluronan (HA) production is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis. The discovery of three genes encoding hyaluronan synthases (HASs) allows for the investigation of the signaling pathways leading to the activation of these genes. Our objective is to further understanding of the regulation of these genes as well as to find ways to prevent undesired gene activation. Human fibroblast-like synoviocytes were used in these experiments. mRNA levels of HAS were monitored by reverse transcriptase-PCR. A series of specific kinase inhibitors were used to investigate intracellular pathways leading to the up-regulation of HAS1. Our experiments, testing a series of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), demonstrate that TGF-β is the most potent stimulus for HAS1 transcription. TGF-β activates HAS1 in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at a concentration of 0.5–1 ng/ml. TGF-β-induced HAS1 mRNA can be detected within 60 min and reaches maximal levels at 6 h. Furthermore, TGF-β treatment leads to an increase in synthase activity as determined by HA ELISA and by in vitro HA synthase assays. In contrast to the activatory effect on HAS1, TGF-β dose-dependently suppresses HAS3 mRNA. As to the mode of action of TGF-β-induced HAS1 mRNA activation, our experiments reveal that blocking p38 MAPK inhibited the TGF-β effect by 90%, blocking the MEK pathway led to an inhibition by 40%, and blocking the JNK pathway had no effect. The presented data might contribute to a better understanding of the role of TGF-β and of HA in the pathology of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2005663939,"Selective and sustained activation of the Raf/MAP kinase pathway in MCF-10A ΔRaf-ER cells, a spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line, was previously shown to protect these cells from suspension-induced cell death, a critical feature of the Ras-transformed phenotype. Although autocrine signalling through the EGF receptor is crucial for the protection induced by Raf in these cells, we report here the existence of an additional, more direct survival mechanism, linking Raf activation to the inhibition of a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, Bim. While detachment from the matrix results in transcriptional induction of two variants of this BH3-only protein, BimEL and BimL, activation of the Raf/ERK signalling both prevents Bim upregulation specifically and leads to phosphorylation and degradation of the BimEL isoform. This represents an important route to protect epithelial cells from the proapoptotic effect of Bim."

The N-terminal sequence of the purified metalloproteinase was exclusively 204EARR, indicating utilization of one of three furin recognition sites. Of many synthetic peptides tested as potential substrates, four peptides derived from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Kit-ligand-1 (KL-1), tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine, and insulin B chain were cleaved by ADAM33; mutation at the catalytic site, E346A, inactivated catalytic activity. Cleavage of APP occurred at His14↓Gln15, not at the α-secretase site and was inefficient (kcat/Km (1.6 ± 0.3) × 102 m–1 s–1). Cleavage of a juxtamembrane KL-1 peptide occurred at a site used physiologically with a similar efficiency. Mutagenesis of KL-1 peptide substrate indicated that the P3, P2, P1, and P3′ residues were critical for activity. In a transfected cell-based sheddase assay, ADAM33 functioned as a negative regulator of APP shedding and mediated some constitutive shedding of KL-1, which was not regulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation. ADAM33 activity was sensitive to several hydroxamate inhibitors (IK682, Ki = 23 ± 7 nm) and to tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs). Activity was inhibited moderately by TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 and weakly inhibited by TIMP-2 but not by TIMP-1, a profile distinct from other ADAMs. The identification of ADAM33 peptide substrates, cellular activity, and a distinct inhibitor profile provide the basis for further functional studies of ADAM33.

In addition to shedding soluble TNF-α after cleavage of the membrane-anchored precursor (13Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P.

ADAM10/Kuzbanian is involved in neuronal development through the cleavage of Notch, a type I transmembrane receptor that controls cell fate determination (23Schlöndorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs of ADAM33 have been cloned from humans and mice and are most closely related to ADAM19, ADAM12, and Xenopus ADAM13 (1Van Eerdewegh P. Little R.D. Dupuis J. Del Mastro R.G. Falls K. Simon J.

Overexpression of ADAM19 in L929 cells suggested that ADAM19 may participate in the shedding of β1-neuregulin, a member of the epidermal growth factor family (15Shirakabe K. Wakatsuki S. Kurisaki T. Fujisawa-Sehara A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9352-9358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Also, purified ADAM19 metalloproteinase cleaved peptides corresponding to the known cleavage sites of TNF-α, TRANCE, and KL-1 (17Chesneau V. Becherer J.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

ADAM12 was reported to process heparin-binding epidermal growth factor in vivo (26Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). ADAMs are synthesized as latent proforms in the endoplasmic reticulum. This latency is the result of a complex formation via a thiol-zinc bond between a conserved cysteine in the prodomain and the essential catalytic Zn2+ in the metalloprotease domain (28Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 29Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The latent ADAMs can be activated by multiple means that dissociate the thiol-zinc bond in the complex, and this mechanism is referred as the “cysteine switch” of activation (30Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Many ADAMs possess a furin recognition site (RXXR) between their pro- and catalytic domains (31Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 32Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A common mechanism to activate these zymogens is through dissociation of the pro-domain following cleavage of the prodomain by furin or furin-like proteases in the trans-Golgi (3Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). ADAMs belong to the metzincin superfamily of metalloproteinases, which also includes matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and snake venom metalloproteinases (3Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The activities of MMPs are regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMPs) during tissue remodeling; to date, four mammalian TIMPs have been identified, which all inhibit the MMPs, but only TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 inhibit some ADAM family members (33Baker A.H. Edwards D.R. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). For instance, TIMP-3 was found to inhibit ADAM12 (27Loechel F. Fox J.W. Murphy G. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), ADAM17 (34Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), and ADAM19 (16Kang T. Park H.I. Suh Y. Zhao Y.G. Tschesche H. Sang Q.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48514-48522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 inhibited ADAM10 (35Amour A. Knight C.G. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The TIMPs are secreted proteins but may be found at the cell surface in association with membrane-bound proteins. Only TIMP-3 is located in the extracellular matrix via its C-terminal domain binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycan (36Nagase H. Brew K. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S51-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the inhibition of ADAMs by TIMPs is still unclear, but it has been suggested that characterization of the TIMP inhibition profile of the remaining ADAMs can aid in endogenous substrate identification (7Amour A. Knight C.G. English W.R. Webster A. Slocombe P.M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we expressed and purified a soluble recombinant form of human ADAM33 catalytic protein and used it to test a number of potential candidate substrate peptides. The identified ADAM33-cleavable peptide substrates, in combination with the knowledge gained from the study of substrate mutagenesis, were used to characterize the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of ADAM33 and its regulation by various synthetic and physiological inhibitors. Reagents—Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All chemicals and insulin B chain peptide were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Human TIMPs were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). All reagents and media for Drosophila S2 cell expression including anti-His6 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Invitrogen unless indicated otherwise. A pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) containing full-length APP or full-length c-Kit ligand (KL-1) was obtained from Dr. L. Zhang (Schering Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) (37Zhang L. Song L. Parker E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8966-8972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or Dr. T. McClanahan (DNAX, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Antibodies to peptides in the ADAM33 pro-domain (Pro1), catalytic domain (ASP2), or cytoplasmic domain (Cyt2) and their use are described elsewhere (19Garlisi C.G. Zou J. Devito K.E. Tian F. Zhu F.X.

The W0 –2 antibody was isolated from a hybridoma cell obtained from Dr. Konrad Beyreuther (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) (38Ida N. Hartmann T. Pantel J. Schroder J. Zerfass R.

Human stem cell factor, also know as c-Kit ligand (KL-1), was detected in culture supernatants of transfected cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Quantakine kit from R & D Systems. Chromatographic columns and the ECL Western blot system were from Amersham Biosciences. Peptides from amyloid precursor protein (APP28) and myelin basic protein were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Peptide substrate for the ADAM17 assay, K(7-methoxycoumarin-4-ylacetyl)SPLAQAVRSSSRK(2,4-dinitrophenyl), was derived from TNF-α and synthesized in-house (see below). Recombinant human ADAM17 (catalytic domain) was a gift from R. Ingram (Schering Plough), and IK682, Marimastat, and Immunex compound 1 were synthesized by Medicinal Chemistry at Schering Plough Research Institute. Expression of ADAM33 in Drosophila S2 Cells—The nucleotides of ADAM33 pro- and catalytic domains (bases 91–1227, corresponding to amino acids Leu31–Pro409) were amplified by PCR using a full-length ADAM33 cDNA template (GenBank™ accession number AF466287) (1Van Eerdewegh P. Little R.D. Dupuis J. Del Mastro R.G. Falls K. Simon J. Torrey D. Pandit S. McKenny J. Braunschweiger K. Walsh A. Liu Z. Hayward B. Folz C. Manning S.P. Bawa A. Saracino L. Thackston M.

Holgate S.T. Keith T.P. Nature. 2002; 418: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). The following PCR primers were used, which added a KpnI site to the 5′-end of the gene fragment: primer 1, 5′-TTA GAT TCA TAG G GTA CCG CTT CAA GGA CAT ATC CCT GGG CAG-3′ and nucleotides encoding a His6 tag plus a XhoI site at the 3′ end; primer 2, 5′-ATC TGA TAT CTC GAG TCA ATG ATG GTG ATG ATG ATG TCC TGA CGG GGC ATT GGA GAG GCA AGC GC-3′. To generate a mutant ADAM33 construct with a single amino acid mutation from glutamic acid to alanine (E346A), a full-length ADAM33 cDNA with an E346A mutation (19Garlisi C.G. Zou J. Devito K.E. Tian F. Zhu F.X. Liu J. Shah H. Wan Y. Billah M.M. Egan R.W. Umland S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used as a template and amplified with the above PCR primer 1 and primer 3 (5′-A TCT GAT ATC TCG AGC CGG GGC ATT GGA GAG GCA AGC G-3′). This set of primers generated the same 5′- and 3′-ends of the ADAM33 cDNA fragment as the above, whereas its 3′-end fuses with V5-His6 tag in frame in the vector, pMT/Bip/V5-His-C (Invitrogen). The PCR-amplified cDNAs of wild type (WT) and E346A mutant were digested with KpnI and XhoI restriction enzymes and ligated into the Drosophila cell expression vector, pMT/Bip/V5-His-C. Both the WT and the E346A mutant cDNA constructs were verified by sequencing, and their amino acid sequences were identical to that encoded by GenBank™ accession number AF466287 (WT), with the exception of the E346A mutation. Each of the plasmid constructs was co-transfected with pCoHYGRO into Drosophila S2 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and stable transfectant cells were selected in the growth medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin-B. The stable transfected Drosophila S2 cell line was maintained at 23 °C in DES® medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% fluronic F-68, 300 μg/ml hygromycin-B. Expression of human ADAM33 protein was induced in the presence of 10 μm CdCl2 and 200 μm ZnCl2 in serum-free medium. The culture medium was harvested 6 days post-induction and cleared by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min. Purification and Characterization of Recombinant Human ADAM33—Conditioned medium was mixed with an equal volume of S-buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) and then applied to an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with S-Buffer A, using the AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein on the column was washed with S-buffer A and 0.1 m NaCl, followed by elution with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.1–0.5 m). Fractions containing ADAM33 were identified by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting (19Garlisi C.G. Zou J. Devito K.E. Tian F. Zhu F.X. Liu J. Shah H. Wan Y. Billah M.M. Egan R.W. Umland S.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), or enzyme activity assays. Fractions containing ADAM33 were combined, adjusted to 20 mm imidazole, and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column equilibrated with Ni2+-NTA buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). The bound protein was washed with Ni2+-NTA buffer A and eluted with Ni2+-NTA buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 500 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol). Fractions containing ADAM33 were combined and concentrated by stirred ultrafiltration cell (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) before loading onto a Superdex-75 column equilibrated with G-buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol). Protein was eluted with 1.5× column volumes of G-buffer. Fractions containing ADAM33 were identified by enzyme activity assays and SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and ADAM33 catalytic domain (ADAM33cat) concentration was estimated by UV absorption using a molar extinction coefficient, ∈280 = 26,780 m–1 cm–1, which was calculated by Genetics Computer Group (GCG) software (Madison, WI). The GCG software was also used to estimate the isoelectric points of recombinant ADAM33 pro- and catalytic domains (pI = 7.9 and 8.3, respectively). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of ADAM33 protein was determined as follows. The protein was separated on a 14% Tris-glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA), transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and analyzed by automated Edman degradation (39Tempst P. Geromanos S. Elicone C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1994; 6: 248-261Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For mass spectrometry sequence identification, Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gel and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) as described (40Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were then subject to mass spectrometric analysis. Deglycosylation of ADAM33 by PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was done according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, purified ADAM33 protein was denatured in denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min at 100 °C prior to deglycosylation with PNGase F for 2 h at 37 °C. The sample was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized in house or purchased from Anaspec (San Jose, CA). Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry was used on either an ABI model 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or an ACT model 496 multiple synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY). The molecular masses of purified peptides were confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Peptide Cleavage Assay—The peptide substrate (50 μm) was incubated with or without ADAM33 (0.1–0.5 μm) in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of various inhibitors (5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline or a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 μm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5 mm iodoacetamide)) (17Chesneau V.

The reaction was quenched by adding 10% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 1%, and samples were analyzed on an Agilent model 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph with C8 column (4.6-mm inner diameter × 50-mm length). Solvents were as follows: A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; B, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. A linear gradient from 2 to 42% B was run over 7 min at 1.5 ml/min, and the eluate was monitored at 214 nm. The percentage of peptide cleavage was calculated using the peak area of the cleaved products divided by the sum of the peak areas of both the products and the remaining substrate. The cleavage sites of the peptide were identified by either electrospray or matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry.

In brief, ADAM33cat (80 nm) was incubated with peptide substrate (30–2000 μm) in assay buffer for 10–60 min at room temperature. Reactions were timed to allow less than 15% turnover of the substrate. The initial cleavage velocities of the peptides were obtained by plotting cleaved product versus reaction time. The kinetic constants, kcat, Km, and kcat/Km, were determined based on best fit of the data with the Michaelis-Menten equation (43Lehninger A.L. Biochemistry.2nd Ed.

Monoclonal Ab against syntaxin 1 was labeled with Cy3 then conjugated with the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 TAT. TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin 1 Ab was transduced rapidly into the subplasmalemmal region in live MIN6 β cells, which enabled us to observe the spatial organization and distribution of endogenous syntaxin 1. TIRFM imaging revealed that syntaxin 1 is distributed in numerous separate clusters in the intact plasma membrane, where insulin secretory granules were docked preferentially to the sites of syntaxin 1 clusters, colocalizing with synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) clusters. TIRFM imaging analysis of the motion of single insulin granules demonstrated that the fusion of insulin secretory granules stimulated by 50 mm KCl occurred exclusively at the sites of the syntaxin 1 clusters. Cholesterol depletion by methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment, in which the syntaxin 1 clusters were disintegrated, decreased the number of docked insulin granules, and, eventually the number of fusion events was significantly reduced. Our results indicate that 1) insulin exocytosis occurs at the site of syntaxin 1 clusters; 2) syntaxin 1 clusters are essential for the docking and fusion of insulin granules in MIN6 β cells; and 3) the sites of syntaxin 1 clusters are distinct from flotillin-1 lipid rafts.

Insulin is stored in large dense core vesicles in pancreatic β cells and is released by exocytosis when glucose levels rise (1Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R.

However, it is not known how t-SNAREs are structurally organized and distributed in the pancreatic β cell plasma membrane and how they spatially interact with the insulin granule during docking and fusion. A recent study described the distribution and spatial organization of t-SNAREs using the procedure of plasma membrane sheets derived from PC12 cells (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroydo P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 8Lang T. Margittai M. Holzler H. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but technical difficulties have prevented such a study in pancreatic β cells. Recently, we developed an approach using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged insulin granule system combined with total internal reflection microscopy (TIRFM) (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using this system, we were able to observe the motion of single insulin granules such as in docking and fusion in the exocytotic process during physiological stimulation. TIRF illuminates fluorophores close to the plasma membrane (within ∼100 nm) (10Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), allowing us to observe with high resolution not only the single insulin granules approaching, docking, and fusing with the plasma membrane but also the spatial localization of endogenous t-SNAREs such as syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 in the plasma membrane of live cells. Therefore, if we could label the endogenous t-SNAREs with fluorophore in live cells, we could reveal the dynamic relationship between insulin exocytosis and t-SNAREs. The powerful strategy of a protein transduction system has been reported previously (11Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 12Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) in studies of the protein transduction domain of HIV-1 TAT protein, which has been shown to cross biological membranes efficiently and to promote delivery of peptides and proteins into cells. Moreover, intracellular delivery of antibodies by chemically conjugating with TAT has been reported (13Stein, S., Weiss, A., Adermann, K., Lanzarovici, P., Hochman, J., and Wellhoner, H. (1999) 458, 383-386Google Scholar, 14Steffen W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 161: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar, 15Niesener U. Halin C. Lozzi L. Gunthert M. Neri P. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Zardi L. Neri D. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We have succeeded previously in delivering TAT-fused peptide into live MIN6 cells (16Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50805-50811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here, we applied this technique modified to TAT-conjugated antibody (Ab) against syntaxin 1, resulting in successful labeling of the endogenous syntaxin 1 in living cells. To determine the insulin exocytotic site in living cells, we took advantage of the techniques for both TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab and GFP-tagged insulin granules combined with TIRFM to refine the in vivo spatial organization and distribution of the t-SNARE, syntaxin 1, in the intact plasma membrane and topological interaction of syntaxin 1 with the docking and fusion of insulin granules. Our results demonstrate that syntaxin 1 is distributed in separate clusters in the intact plasma membrane where insulin granules are preferentially docked and fused, indicating that syntaxin 1 clusters are requisite for effective insulin exocytosis. Plasmid Construction—The construction of GFP-insulin in expression vector has been described previously (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal Ab were used for the following proteins: syntaxin 1 (obtained from Sigma), SNAP-25 (obtained from WAKO Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and flotillin-1 (obtained from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Rabbit polyclonal sera were used for syntaxin 1 (5Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Cy3, and fluorescein and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 and fluorescein were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). TAT-conjugated Ab—Monoclonal anti-syntaxin 1 Ab was labeled with Cy3 using a Fluoro Link-Ab Cy3 labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The Cy3-labeled Ab was dialyzed against 0.1 m borate buffer and incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of a cross-linker, sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[3′-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionamido] hexanoate (Pierce) for 3 h at room temperature. The conjugated Ab was separated from free cross-linker by gel filtration eluted with Hanks'-HEPES (5 mm) buffer (pH 7.2). A 10-fold molar excess of TAT protein transduction domain peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) was added to the conjugated Ab, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The TAT-conjugated Ab was separated from free TAT protein transduction domain peptide by gel filtration eluted with Hanks'-HEPES (5 mm) buffer. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transduction with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Antibody—MIN6 cells (a gift from Dr. J.-i. Miyazaki, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) at passage 15-30 were cultured as described previously (5Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) on fibronectin-coated (KOKEN, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) high refractive index glass (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) for imaging with TIRFM (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding the GFP-tagged insulin as described previously (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed between 3 and 4 days after transfection. On the day of experiments using TIRFM, MIN6 cells were transduced for 50 min with the TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin 1 Ab (∼120 μg/ml). To determine the transduction of the TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab into the cells, the fluorescence images of the cells in glass chamber slides (8 wells; Lab-Tek slides, Nunc, Rochester, NY) were observed for 0-50 min using a Zeiss confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Germany). To analyze the average fluorescence intensity in cells treated with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab, confocal images were exported as single TIFF files to Metamorph 4.6 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA), and the average of the pixel gray scale values (Σ gray scale value/number of pixels) in each whole cell was determined. Evanescent Wave Microscopy—The Olympus total internal reflection (TIRF) system was used with an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus) and a high aperture objective lens (Apo 100× OHR; NA 1.65, Olympus) as described previously (16Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50805-50811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this study, the microscope was modified to allow both epifluorescence (EPIF) and through-the-objective TIRF illumination. To observe GFP alone, we used a 488-nm laser line for excitation and a 515-nm long pass filter for the barrier. To observe the fluorescence image of GFP and Cy3 simultaneously under TIRF illumination, we used the 488-nm laser line for excitation and an image splitter (MultiSpec Micro-Imager, Optical Insight, Santa Fe, NM) that divided the green and red components of the images with 565-nm dichroic mirror (Q565, Chroma, Brattelboro, VT) and passed the green component through a 530 ± 15 nm band pass filter (HQ530/30m; Chroma) and the red component through a 630 nm ± 25 nm band pass filter (HQ630/50m; Chroma). The images were then projected side by side onto a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Micromax, MMX-512-BFT, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ; operated with Metamorph 4.6). Images were acquired at 300-ms intervals. Most analyses, including tracking (single projection of difference images) and area calculations were performed using Metamorph software. The two images were brought into focus in the same plane by adding weak lenses to one channel, and they were brought into resister by careful adjustment of the mirrors in the image splitter. Before each experimental session, we took an alignment image, showing density by means of scattered 100-nm TetraSpeck fluorescent beads (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). They were visible in both the green and red channels and thus provided markers in the x-y plane. Beads in the two images were brought into superposition by shifting one image using Metamorph software. The space constant for the exponential decay of the evanescent field was ∼80 nm (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For the study of the real time images of GFP-tagged insulin granule motion by TIRF, treated MIN6 cells were placed on the high refractive index glass, mounted in an open chamber, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 110 mm NaCl, 4.4 mm KCl, 1.45 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.3 mm calcium gluconate, 4.8 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then transferred to the thermostat-controlled stage (37 °C) of TIRFM. Stimulation with KCl was achieved by the addition of 100 mm KCl-Krebs-Ringer buffer (NaCl was reduced to maintain the isotonicity of the solution) into the chamber (final = 50 mm KCl). Immunocytochemical Analysis—Cells were fixed, made permeable with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100, and processed for immunocytochemical analysis as described previously (5Nagamatsu S. Watanabe T. Nakamichi Y. Yamamura C. Tsuzuki K. Matsushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8053-8060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of GFP and Cy3 was maintained in this condition. Flotation Density Gradient—MIN6 cells cultured on 6-cm dishes were washed twice in cold Krebs-Ringer buffer, then scraped and spun down at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C. The cells were homogenized and solubilized with 300 μl of Tris buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), containing 10% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml anti-pain on ice for 30 min. The suspension was mixed with 600 μl of cold Optiprep™ (Nycomed-Pharma, Oslo, Norway). The mix was transferred to two centrifuge tubes and was overlaid with a 350-μl step each of 35, 30, 25, 20, and 0% Optiprep™ in the Tris buffer. The gradients were spun for 2 h at 50,000 rpm at 4 °C. The fractions were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (16Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50805-50811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or cholesterol assay with cholesterol oxidize using Cholesterol CII assay kit (WAKO). Insulin Release Assay—Batch experiments using MIN6 cells were performed as described previously (9Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Tanaka T. Ishida H. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3805-3808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and the amounts of insulin released into the media and cell extracts were analyzed by radioimmunoassay. t-SNAREs Are Distributed in Separate Clusters in the Plasma Membrane of MIN6 β Cells—To analyze the localization of t-SNAREs and their association with insulin granules in the plasma membrane of MIN6 β cells, GFP-tagged insulin-transfected cells were fixed, immunostained with anti-syntaxin 1 and anti-SNAP-25 antibodies, and observed by both EPIF (common) microscopy and TIRFM of the same cell. Under EPIF microscopy, the entire cell was visible; the immunofluorescence of syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 was observed to be mainly subplasmalemmal (Fig. 1, EPIF). In contrast, TIRFM, which selectively illuminates subcellular features just beneath the plasma membrane at the cell glass coverslip contact region (within ∼80 nm), showed that the immunofluorescence of syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 was distributed in numerous spots, which suggests that t-SNAREs are concentrated in separate clusters in the plasma membrane of MIN6 cells (Fig. 1, TIRF). The SNAP-25 clusters were more dense than those of syntaxin 1 (syntaxin clusters, 179 ± 14/200 μm2; SNAP-25 clusters, 329 ± 18/200 μm2; n = 8 cells). Dual stained immunohistochemical studies for syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 showed that most of the syntaxin 1 clusters were colocalized with the SNAP-25 clusters (93 ± 3.0%; n = 4 cells) (Fig. 1C). The apparent diameters of the syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 clusters were 416 ± 11 nm and 429 ± 18 nm, respectively (n = 6 cells each). To obtain the estimation of real diameter of the clusters, the point spread function (PSF) was determined by measuring the diameter of 90-nm fluorescent beads, which was 340 ± 27 nm (35 beads) under our experimental conditions. PSF=((beadsmeasureddiameter)2-(beadsrealdiameter)2)1/2 The real diameter of the spots was calculated by subtraction of the PSF, clusterrealsize=((clustermeasuredsize)2-(PSF)2)1/2 resulting in 256 ± 18 nm (syntaxin) and 277 ± 27 nm (SNAP-25); these measurements are within the range similar to that seen in PC12 cells reported elsewhere by different procedures (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroydo P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, many GFP-labeled insulin granules appeared to be colocalized with syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 clusters. However, we cannot conclude that t-SNAREs clusters are definitely colocalized with insulin granules on the basis of these data because it cannot be ruled out that the colocalization of t-SNARE proteins with the insulin granules shown in Fig. 1 may be the result of the amplification used in the immunostaining and protein clumping caused by fixation. To overcome these problems, we tried to label the syntaxin 1 and insulin granules in living cells without the fixation procedure. Colocalization of TAT-conjugated Ab-labeled Syntaxin 1 and Insulin Granule in the Plasma Membrane—To determine whether syntaxin 1 clusters are colocalized with insulin granules in the plasma membrane of living cell and whether the fusion of insulin granules occurs at the syntaxin 1 clusters, a method for labeling endogenous syntaxin with fluorophore in live cells was needed. We visualized the endogenous syntaxin 1 with Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin 1 Ab by conjugating with HIV-1 TAT in live cells (Fig. 2). In agreement with the results of the previous experiments using TAT-fused peptide (16Ohara-Imaizumi M. Nakamichi Y. Nishiwaki C. Nagamatsu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50805-50811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and TAT-conjugated Ab (13Stein, S., Weiss, A., Adermann, K., Lanzarovici, P., Hochman, J., and Wellhoner, H. (1999) 458, 383-386Google Scholar, 14Steffen W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 161: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar, 15Niesener U. Halin C. Lozzi L. Gunthert M. Neri P. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Zardi L. Neri D. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin 1 Ab was rapidly transduced into the cells, reaching near maximum intracellular concentration in less than 20 min (Fig. 2, A and B). 20 min after treatment with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab, Cy3 fluorescence was localized primarily in the subplasmalemmal region and was also observed as dots in the cytosol as well as dispersion in the cytoplasm of the cells under confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 2A). Although the mechanism of the TAT-mediated delivery of proteins into cell has not been fully defined yet (17Lindsay M.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), it is likely that TAT-fused protein enters cells by uncharacterized pinocytosis/endocytosis and is initially within endosomal compartment (18Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 19Potocky T.B. Menon A.K. Gellman S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50188-50194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Indeed, Fig. 2A displays Cy3 fluorescence strongly in endosomes and the plasma membrane, as well as weakly in the cytoplasm. To ensure that the TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin 1 Ab specifically binds endogenous syntaxin 1 clusters in the plasma membrane, we performed experiments using TAT-conjugated monoclonal anti-syntaxin 1 Ab and polyclonal anti-syntaxin 1 Ab. MIN6 cells treated with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab (monoclonal) for 30 min were fixed with parafomaldelyde and immunostained with anti-syntaxin 1 polyclonal Ab (Fig. 2C). There was a significant overlap of syntaxin clusters labeled with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab (red) and those stained with polyclonal Ab (green), which suggests that TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab was actually localized at the endogenous syntaxin. Furthermore, highly magnified viewing revealed that spots for syntaxin clusters labeled with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab were precisely coincided with those stained by anti-syntaxin 1 polyclonal Ab (Fig. 2D). Thus, the transduction system with TAT-conjugated anti-syntaxin 1 Ab is highly efficient for labeling the endogenous syntaxin 1 in the plasma membrane in living MIN6 β cells. We then examined whether spots for syntaxin clusters corresponded with the docking sites of insulin granules in living β cells without the fixation procedure to avoid experiment-induced artifacts. For this purpose, MIN6 cells were first transfected with GFP-tagged insulin expression vector and then treated with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled anti-syntaxin Ab to visualize the insulin granules and syntaxin 1 clusters in living cells using TIRFM. To analyze the colocalization of the insulin granules with syntaxin 1 clusters, we first selected the area where the docking sites of insulin granules are similar to sites of syntaxin 1 clusters. Then, a dual image of GFP and Cy3 fluorescences was acquired by TIRFM. As shown in Fig. 3A, spots for insulin granules (green) were associated with areas for syntaxin 1 clusters, although those spots appear enlarged because of the fluorescence of GFP and Cy3, and the diffraction limited resolution of the objective. Indeed, the diameter of insulin granules observed in TIRF image was 426 ± 13 nm (n = 5 cells), although the real size of insulin granules was calculated as 272 ± 20 nm, using a formula based on PSF, as outlined above, which agreed well with the value (289 nm) measured from electronmicroscopy using mouse pancreas (20Dean P.M. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Similarly, the real diameter of syntaxin 1 clusters in living cells was calculated into 261 ± 30 nm, on the basis of the apparent size of TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled syntaxin 1 clusters (419 ± 19 nm). To correct the apparent sizes to real sizes based on these values, circles (400-nm diameter) drawn around fluorescent spots for GFP-labeled insulin granules and Cy3-labeled syntaxin 1 clusters observed in TIRF images (Fig. 3A) were reduced to 68 and 65%, respectively (Fig. 3B). As shown in the drawing in Fig. 3B, insulin granules were localized precisely with syntaxin 1 clusters. Taken together with the data, insulin granules are actually colocalized with syntaxin 1 clusters in the plasma membrane of living MIN6 cells. Syntaxin 1 Clusters Are Sites for Fusion of Insulin Granule—Next, to investigate whether fusion from insulin secretory granules occurs at sites of syntaxin 1 clusters, we monitored the motion of GFP-tagged insulin secretory granules and their interaction with Cy3-labeled syntaxin 1 in live MIN6 cells. Under the basal conditions, quantitation by TIRF imaging revealed that 73.5 ± 5.1% of GFP-tagged insulin granules corresponded to the syntaxin 1 clusters, whereas about 27% of granules were not on syntaxin 1 clusters (Fig. 4A; n = 5 cells). Stimulation with high KCl (50 mm) clearly revealed that the fusion events of insulin granules occurred exclusively at the syntaxin 1 clusters (Fig. 4A; granules to be fused are indicated by arrows: see also Movie 1). Fig. 4B shows sequential images (1 × 1 μm, 300-ms intervals) of the single granule (green) and the syntaxin cluster (red) simultaneously observed during KCl stimulation. Notably, GFP-fluorescent spots, which were present at the syntaxin 1 clusters, suddenly brightened and finally spread as GFP-tagged insulin diffused laterally through fusion on the plasma membrane, whereas no changes were observed in the syntaxin 1 clusters during and after granule exocytosis (see also Movie 1). Because the number of fusion events in the cells transduced with TAT-conjugated Ab was similar to that in control cells, labeling endogenous syntaxin with TAT-conjugated Cy3-labeled Ab does not affect the insulin exocytosis (data not shown). Thus, our results demonstrate that the fusion of insulin granules occurs exclusively at the site of syntaxin 1 clusters. Syntaxin 1 Clusters Are Required for Effective Insulin Exocytosis—We then examined whether t-SNARE clusters are required for insulin exocytosis. For this purpose, we used a methyl-β-cyclodextrin that is known to extract the cholesterol from the plasma membrane selectively and rapidly, in preference to other membrane lipids (21Ohtani Y. Irie T. Uekama K. Fukunaga K. Pitha J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 22Kilsdonk E. Yancey P.G. Stoudt G.W. Bangerter F.W. Johnson W.I. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17250-17256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Because the formation of syntaxin 1 clusters has been reported to be dependent on the cholesterol in the plasma membrane in other cell types (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroydo P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), we expected that cholesterol depletion in the plasma membrane of MIN6 cells would disintegrate the syntaxin clusters. Indeed, the treatment of MIN6 cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (10 mm for 30 min) caused the disruption of syntaxin 1 clusters (Fig. 5A). The clusters were disintegrated, and syntaxin was dispersed on the membrane in a methyl-β-cyclodextrin concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). Along with the disintegration of syntaxin 1 clusters, the number of docked insulin granules was decreased markedly (Fig. 5A) (66 ± 9 granules/200 μm2versus 41 ± 8 granules/200 μm2; n = 6 cells). We then stimulated these cells with 50 mm KCl. As shown in Fig. 5B, the methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment markedly reduced the number of fusion events, consistent with the insulin release data measured by radioimmunoassay (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, no difference was observed in the kinetics of individual fusion events (Fig. 5D). Lang et al. (7Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroydo P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) reported that syntaxin 1 clusters are prerequisite for fusion in PC12 cells; however, our results using live MIN6 cells clearly demonstrated that the syntaxin 1 clusters are essential for granule docking, but not for fusion itself. Taken together, we concluded that the reduced number of fusion events occurring with the methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment resulted from the decreased number of docked insulin granules caused by disruption of syntaxin 1 clusters. Several molecules such as SNAREs and Rabs have been proposed as the candidate responsible for granule docking (23Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E145-E147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 24Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In pancreatic β cells, SNARE proteins are known to regulate insulin exocytosis (2Nagamatsu S. Fujiwara T. Nakamichi Y. Watanabe T. Katahira H. Sawa H. Akagawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1160-1165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Sadoul K. Lang J. Montecucco C. Weller U. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Wollheim C.B. Halban P.A. J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2723-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); however, no specific molecules have been determined to govern insulin granule docking. The present data at least indicate that the presence of syntaxin 1 clusters is a prerequisite for insulin granule docking, followed by fusion. Syntaxin Clusters Are Distinct from Flotillin-enriched Lipid Membrane Raft—Recently, lipid microdomains rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, also known as lipid rafts, have been proposed as the region within the plasma membrane which is important for signal transduction, including the exocytotic and endocytic pathways (27Ikonen E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 28Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Encinas M. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 412-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been reported that syntaxin 1A/SNAP-25 heterodimers are present in rafts and are implicated in the regulated exocytosis of dopamine from PC12 cells (29Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the relationship between syntaxin 1 clusters and lipid rafts in MIN6 cells. Cellular fractions of MIN6 cells obtained by discontinuous Optiprep™-sucrose gradient were analyzed by immunoblotting and cholesterol assay. Although caveolae are a specific form of lipid rafts and implicated in important cellular functions in various cell types (30Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar, 31Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar), caveolin expression was barely detectable in MIN6 cells (data not shown), in agreement with the results of studies of PC12 cells (29Chamberlain L.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used an Ab against flotillin-1(reggie-2), a protein that is known to be enriched in lipid rafts (34Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E. Oh O. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 35Salzer U. Prohaska R. Blood. 2001; 97: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), as a marker of lipid rafts. As shown in Fig. 6A, flotillin-1 was present in the two fractions from the top of the gradient, which confirms that these fractions are rich in lipid rafts. On the contrary, syntaxin 1 was present in the two fractions from the bottom of the gradient with relatively high concentrations of cholesterol. In addition, immunostaining of the cells for syntaxin 1 and flotillin-1 simultaneously revealed that syntaxin 1 clusters do not colocalize with flotillin-1 lipid rafts (Fig. 6B). Our results suggest that syntaxin 1 clusters are cholesterol-dependent, whereas they are distinct from the lipid raft, so there was no clear evidence showing the direct interaction between lipid rafts and insulin exocytosis in MIN6 cells. In conclusion, insulin secretory granules are docked preferentially on the syntaxin 1 clusters and fused exclusively at the site of syntaxin 1 clusters in MIN6 β cells, which are distinct from flotillin-1 lipid rafts. We thank Dr. S. Maekawa (Kobe University) for the helpful discussions about lipid rafts. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmNDIyMzAxODZjOWU3MjViOGJlNDhmZjBiYTQ2MmYxNCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjg3OTgxNDM5fQ.Wim0_6uNCX1P6rHkHrOF13MkGdlODxW-7V_fMHJhbfO3xRur-YyGt8ncaXIzpHJ9g3owKdMA3c9rrkbWzbfjLuhEeZcbyRvr45Zuvog2j4-VVyfWIFf2Z7hR4bY3j4O078SWojml6imIUT13CguHWqdz6XtL409xpxthrM8Xl0wwutJRfsa1BB7UKlfS4y10ZCRZ8ElhEZbp7JksIVCcv_43fJDEp17GcgR2NFWWsnUJhTuuJqQDRL2lG58iv2l7x9lhIt4TcHc_wpSKIkgjFCn2Y7KQqdukv4B0IEruzu4lh8z7-VJvl-r0FaFIfKQz5h509h0nVrGt7XFDgUqjmg Download .mp4 (2.1 MB) Help with .mp4 files"

The molecular and genetic basis underlying cellular sensitivity to hypoxic injury is unclear. Here we have selected death-resistant cells by repeated episodes of hypoxia. The selected cells are cross-resistant to apoptosis induced by staurosporine, azide, and cisplatin. These cells up-regulate Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic protein. Bcl-XL interacts with the pro-apoptotic molecule Bax and abrogates its toxicity in mitochondria, resulting in the preservation of mitochondrial integrity, cytochrome c, and cell viability. Down-regulation of Bcl-XL by antisense oligonucleotides or the newly identified Bcl-XL inhibitor chelerythrine restores cellular sensitivity to injury and death. Thus, Bcl-XL is a key molecule for hypoxia selection of death resistance.

Lack of oxygen, i.e. hypoxia, can lead to cell injury and death and determine tissue pathology in ischemic diseases including stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute renal failure (1Semenza G.L. Agani F. Feldser D. Iyer N. Kotch L. Laughner E. Yu A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 475: 123-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, cells possess finely tuned systems to sense the drop of oxygen tension and adapt to hypoxic stress (2Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol.

In addition, survival mechanisms including the expression of death inhibitory genes are activated by hypoxia (8Dong Z. Venkatachalam M.A. Wang J. Patel Y. Saikumar P. Semenza G.L. Force T.

Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2140) Google Scholar). Although some cells die because of oxygen deficiency, other tumor cells survive the stress and adapt to the hypoxic microenvironment. These cells ultimately become more aggressive and resistant to cell death during cancer therapy (9Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harris A.L. Nat. Rev.

The cells were subsequently lysed with 0.05% digitonin to release cytosol. Digitonin-insoluble membrane fractions were collected and subjected to electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions for immunoblot analysis. Statistics—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. (n ≥4). Statistical differences between means were determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) by two-tailed tests. p < 0.05 was considered to reflect significant differences. Our overall strategy was to subject cells to cycles of hypoxic challenge to kill vulnerable cells and select resistant colonies. To this end, kidney epithelial cells were exposed to severe hypoxia for 6.5 h in glucose-free medium. The cells were then returned to full culture medium for recovery. After recovery, surviving cells were subjected to further hypoxic cycles. Hypoxia led to cell death mainly in the form of apoptosis (18Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cell death during the first hypoxic cycle was ∼75%, and the death rate decreased to <5% after seven sequential selections (Fig. 1a). The selected cells were also resistant to cell injury induced by other stimuli including the respiration inhibitor azide, the cancer therapy drug cisplatin, and the broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS) (Fig. 1b). For example, 5 h of STS induced 62% apoptosis in wild-type cells (WT) but only 13% in hypoxia-selected cells. The activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases involved in apoptosis (24Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6138) Google Scholar), was also significantly suppressed in the selected cells (Fig. 1b). Representative images of the cells are shown in Fig. 1c. Phase-contrast microscopy showed cellular shrinkage and fragmentation, typical morphological features of apoptosis. Nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342 demonstrated chromosomal condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Again, compared with wild type, apoptosis was significantly less in hypoxia-selected cells. Thus, after seven cycles of hypoxia, we have selected cells that are resistant to cell injury and death induced by different types of insults. We then investigated why the selected cells were more resistant to cell injury. The observation that these cells became cross-resistant to different types of insults suggests that molecular alterations in the common death pathways might be responsible. Two major pathways for apoptosis have been delineated: 1) the death receptor-mediated intrinsic pathway and 2) the mitochondrion-mediated extrinsic pathway (25Green D.R.

Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Earlier studies including ours indicate that hypoxia, azide, and STS induce apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway (18Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Dong Z. Wang J.Z. Yu F. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has been shown that these stimuli activate pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins to permeabilize the outer membrane of mitochondria, leading to the release of apoptogenic proteins such as Cyt c. Cyt c, after being released, binds Apaf-1 in the cytosol and activates caspase-9, which proteolytically activates downstream executioner caspases (18Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Dong Z. Wang J.Z. Yu F. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J.

J. 2000; 347: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, we first determined whether hypoxia-selected cells were resistant to Cyt c release, a hallmark of outer membrane damage in mitochondria (29Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Without treatment, Cyt c was detected exclusively in the mitochondrial fraction in both wild-type and selected cells (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 and 5). STS incubation for 4 h led to the release of Cyt c into the cytosol in wild-type cells (lane 2) but not in hypoxia-selected cells (lane 6). Longer STS treatment led to further Cyt c release in wild-type cells (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the release in hypoxia-selected cells, although becoming detectable, was much lower (lanes 7 and 8). The results were confirmed by immunofluorescence, demonstrating that significantly fewer cells leaked Cyt c into the cytosol in hypoxia-selected group during STS incubation (Fig. 2b). Targeting of mitochondria by pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bax, Bak, and Bid) can be a primary cause of outer membrane leakage (31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Our earlier work has suggested a critical role for Bax in mitochondrial damage during hypoxia and STS-induced apoptosis (18Saikumar P. Dong Z. Patel Y. Hall K. Hopfer U. Weinberg J.M. Venkatachalam M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3401-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Dong Z. Wang J.Z. Yu F. Venkatachalam M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 663-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine why hypoxia-selected cells were resistant to Cyt c release, we examined the targeting of mitochondria by Bax. STS treatment led to the accumulation or targeting of Bax to mitochondria (Fig. 2c, lanes 1–4), and importantly, Bax movement was suppressed in hypoxia-selected cells (lanes 5–8). For example, by the end of 4 h of STS, significant amounts of Bax moved to the mitochondrial fraction in wild-type cells (lane 2) but not in hypoxia-selected cells (lane 6). We further analyzed the oligomerization status of Bax, because permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane appears to depend on the formation of Bax oligomers (31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). To reveal the oligomers, cells were subjected to chemical cross-linking with DSP to preserve protein-protein interactions and the mitochondrial fractions were extracted for immunoblot analysis of Bax. As shown in Fig. 2d, significant amounts of Bax oligomerized in wild-type cells after 5 h of STS treatment (lane 1). The oligomers were resolved into monomers when the samples were treated with dithiothreitol, a reducing reagent that breaks up the disulfide bond in DSP (lane 2). In sharp contrast, Bax in hypoxia-selected cells did not form oligomers (lanes 3 and 4). Thus, hypoxia-selected cells were resistant to injury and death at the mitochondrial level, showing less Bax accumulation, oligomerization, outer membrane damage, and Cyt c release. We further determined whether these cells were also resistant at levels downstream of Cyt c release, i.e. in the cytosol. To this end, we isolated cytosol from wild-type and hypoxia-selected cells and compared their capacity of caspase activation after adding exogenous Cyt c (Fig. 2e). Clearly, in the presence of the same amounts of Cyt c, greater caspase activity was reconstituted in the cytosol of hypoxia-selected cells than the wild-type. Thus, death resistance of hypoxia-selected cells did not occur in the cytosol, rather it was at the level of mitochondria. To identify the mitochondrial changes responsible for death resistance of hypoxia-selected cells, we focused on the Bcl-2 family proteins. Bcl-2 family proteins are important regulators of apoptosis (30Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A major acting site for these proteins is the mitochondria. We first compared the expression and intracellular distribution of the proteins in wild-type and hypoxia-selected cells by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3a, both types of cells had similar levels of expression for Bax, Bak, and Bid, the three pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Subcellular distribution of these proteins in wild-type and hypoxia-selected cells also appeared similar, with the majority of Bax and Bid in the cytosol and Bak in the membrane-bound organellar fraction (Fig. 3a). Bcl-2 expression was low and barely detectable by immunoblotting in both cell types (Fig. 3a). Nevertheless, immunoprecipitation revealed similar levels of Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 3b). On the other hand, the expression of Bcl-XL, another well documented anti-apoptotic protein (30Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar), was noticeably higher in hypoxia-selected cells (Fig. 3a). Bcl-XL was detected in the cytosol as well as in the membrane fraction enriched with mitochondria (Fig. 3a). Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots indicated that Bcl-XL in the selected cells was 5.7-fold higher than that of wild type (Fig. 3c). Up-regulation of Bcl-XL in hypoxia-selected cells was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3b). Pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may antagonize each other through heterodimerizations (30Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 32Scorrano L.

Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that, in hypoxia-selected cells, Bcl-XL might directly interact with Bax. As shown in Fig. 3d, precipitation with an anti-Bcl-XL antibody pulled down not only Bcl-XL but also Bax from whole cell lysates, cytosolic extracts, and to a less extent, membrane extracts (lanes 1–3). Consistently, anti-Bax antibodies precipitated Bax as well as Bcl-XL (Fig. 3d, lanes 4–6). The results suggest that Bcl-XL may interact with Bax and antagonize its toxicity, leading to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity and cell viability. To further determine the role of Bcl-XL in death resistance of hypoxia-selected cells, we down-regulated its expression using a specific antisense oligonucleotide (37Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In hypoxia-selected cells, the antisense inhibited Bcl-XL expression without affecting the expression of β-actin (Fig. 4a, lanes 1–3). A control oligonucleotide with scrambled sequence was not effective in down-regulating Bcl-XL (Fig. 4a, lanes 4–6). We then examined the effect of Bcl-XL antisense on apoptosis induced by STS. The results are summarized in Fig. 4b. Without STS treatment, apoptosis was always below 10%. In line with previous observations, STS incubation for 5 h led to 57% apoptosis in wildtype cells but only 17% in hypoxia-selected cells. Of significance, down-regulation of Bcl-XL by antisense restored the sensitivity of hypoxia-selected cells to injury. As a result, 60% apoptosis was now induced by STS. The scrambled sequence showed no effect (Fig. 4b). These results suggest a critical role for Bcl-XL in death resistance of hypoxia-selected cells. We further showed that Bcl-XL antisense drastically promoted Bax targeting of mitochondria in hypoxia-selected cells (Fig. 4c, lane 4), which was accompanied by outer membrane damage, shown as increased release of Cyt c (Fig. 4d, lane 4). By immunofluorescence, we confirmed that significantly more cells leaked Cyt c into the cytosol in the antisense-treated group (Fig. 4i) compared with the scrambled sequence group (Fig. 4e). Importantly, the cells with leaked Cyt c activated caspases (Fig. 4, f and j) and developed apoptotic morphology including nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 4, g and k). This was clearly shown by superimposition of the images (Fig. 4, h and l). The results indicate that antisense down-regulation of Bcl-XL in hypoxia-selected cells restored their sensitivity to cell injury and death. We further tested the effects of chelerythrine, a newly identified pharmacological inhibitor of Bcl-XL (38Chan S.L. Lee M.C. Tan K.O. Yang L.K. Lee A.S. Flotow H. Fu N.Y. Butler M.S. Soejarto D.D. Buss A.D. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20453-20456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Chelerythrine increased apoptosis in hypoxia-selected cells at concentrations of 1–5 μm (data not shown). Together, these results suggest a critical role for Bcl-XL in death resistance of hypoxia-selected cells. In conclusion, we have selected death-resistant cells through repeated episodes of hypoxia. These cells are cross-resistant to cell death and injury induced by different types of insults. Death resistance of the cells occurs at the level of mitochondria, and a critical molecular determinant appears to be Bcl-XL. Up-regulation of Bcl-XL in hypoxia-selected cells preserves the integrity of mitochondria and cellular viability, probably by antagonizing pro-apoptotic molecules such as Bax. The findings may have implications for the pathogenesis of chronic or fluctuating hypoxia, conditions found in solid tumors. In solid tumors, malformation and malfunction of blood vessels lead to the development of hypoxic microenvironments (9Brown J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5863-5870PubMed Google Scholar, 10Harris A.L.

Under these conditions, some cells die because of oxygen deficiency, whereas others survive the stress and become resistant to injury and death during cancer therapy (11Hockel M. Vaupel P. J. Natl.

Notably, elevated expression of Bcl-XL is detected in solid tumors such as colorectal adenocarcinomas, Kaposi’s sarcoma, and multiple myeloma (39Krajewska M. Moss S.F. Krajewski S. Song K. Holt P.R.

https://openalex.org/W2092492198,"Proteases are involved in many aspects of tumor progression, including cell survival and proliferation, escape from immune surveillance, cell adhesion and migration, remodeling and invasion of the extracellular matrix. Several lysosomal cysteine proteases have been cloned and shown to be overexpressed in cancer; yet, despite the great potential for development of novel therapeutics, we still know little about the regulation of their proteolytic activity. Cystatins such as cystatin M are potent endogenous protein inhibitors of lysosomal cysteine proteases. Cystatin M is expressed in normal and premalignant human epithelial cells, but not in many cancer cell lines. Here, we examined the effects of cystatin M expression on malignant properties of human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-435S cells. Cystatin M was found to significantly reduce in vitro: cell proliferation, migration, Matrigel invasion, and adhesion to endothelial cells. Reduction of cell proliferation and adhesion to an endothelial cell monolayer were both independent of the inhibition of lysosomal cysteine proteases. In contrast, cell migration and matrix invasion seemed to rely on lysosomal cysteine proteases, as both recombinant cystatin M and E64 were able to block these processes. This study provides the first evidence that cystatin M may play important roles in safeguarding against human breast cancer."

We reported previously that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 induces a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of uPA mRNA and protein in highly invasive human ovarian cancer cell line HRA, leading to invasion. To further elucidate the mechanism of the invasive effect of TGF-β1, we investigated which signaling pathway transduced by TGF-β1 is responsible for this effect. Here, we show that 1) nontoxic concentrations of TGF-β1 activated Src kinase; 2) TGF-β1 rapidly phosphorylates ERK1/2 and Akt, but not p38; 3) pharmacological Src inhibitor PP2 or antisense (AS) c-Src oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) treatment reduced TGF-β1-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt by 85–90% compared with controls; 4) pharmacological inhibition of MAPK by PD98059 abrogated TGF-β1-mediated Akt stimulation, whereas TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 stimulation was not inhibited by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or AS-PI3K ODN transfection; 5) up-regulation of uPA mRNA in response to TGF-β1 was almost totally blocked by PP2 and PD98059 and partially (∼55%) by LY294002; 6) TGF-β1-induced uPA mRNA up-regulation was inhibited by treatment with AS ODNs to c-Src or PI3K by 90 or 60%, respectively, compared with control ODN treatment; and 7) blockade of the release of the transcription factor NF-κB by pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate reduced the TGF-β1-induced activation of the uPA gene by ∼65%. In addition, curcumin, a blocker of the transcriptional factor AP-1, partially (35%) canceled this effect.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7790-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) remains less known. In a well characterized human ovarian cancer HRA cell model using antisense strategies and pharmacological inhibitors, we examined the distinct TGF-β signaling events. Previous work from several laboratories has shown that uPA up-regulation is a major point of convergence for the actions of a variety of effectors that affect cell biology, including Src, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and Smads (5Iglesias M. Frontelo P. Gamallo C. Quintanilla M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4134-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accumulating data indicate that these pathways have been implicated in a number of phenomena associated with tumor promotion (6Shin E.Y. Ma E.K. Kim C.K. Kwak S.J. Kim E.G. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 128: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Src kinase pathway is involved in this early TGF-β signaling (3Kim J.T. Joo C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31938-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Rak J. Filmus J. Finkenzeller G. Grugel S. Marme D. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The Smad signaling pathway constitutes a main signal transduction route downstream of TGF-β receptors (8Mehra A. Wrana J.L. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 605-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence for interactions between the Smad and the MAPK pathways (9Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is precedence for the involvement of transcription factor activation in TGF-β-mediated biological functions. For instance, TGF-β activates AP-1 and NF-κB in the T cell line, leading to interleukin-2 expression (10Han S.H. Yea S.S. Jeon Y.J. Yang K.H. Kaminski N.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 287: 1105-1112PubMed Google Scholar). Specific inhibition of PI3K activity and down-modulation of the protein could prevent the uPA up-regulation in HRA cells. 2H. Kobayashi and M. Suzuki, unpublished data.2H. Kobayashi and M. Suzuki, unpublished data. PI3K is activated by a large spectrum of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones (11Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This activation of PI3K is generally regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Moreover, activation of a number of downstream signaling proteins is known to be regulated by PI3K and its lipid products including Akt, p70S6 kinase, and Rac (12Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J.

A. 2001; 98: 10983-10985Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that Akt activates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB (16Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar, 17Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). Indeed, Src, MAPK, and PI3K are present in the HRA cells, a well established model for the study of invasive phenotypic change when the cells are treated with TGF-β1. Here, we explored the signal transduction mechanisms downstream of the TGF-β receptors that result in uPA upregulation and cell invasion. However, mechanisms by which TGF-β up-regulates uPA expression are heterogeneous and depend upon the particular complement of signaling molecules expressed within a given cell type. We therefore investigated the effects of TGF-β1 on the Src-dependent uPA up-regulation and invasiveness of parental and transfected HRA cells in relation to the status of MAPK, PI3K, and Smad in HRA cells. We then examined involvement of the Src, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in NF-κB and AP-1 activation. The key experiments were repeated with a few additional ovarian cancer cell lines to assess the potential generality of the results. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of TGF-β in up-regulating uPA expression. Materials—LipofectAMINE Plus reagent was purchased from Invitrogen.

The inhibitors diluted in normal growth medium were added to wells containing confluent cells and incubated for 30 min to 1 h. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was added to serum-free medium containing the respective inhibitors and incubated for the indicated periods of time, after which time the conditioned medium and cells were separately collected, and the cells were counted. The samples were stored at –80 °C until measured. Me2SO (0.05%, v/v) diluted in medium was used as a negative control.

Kobayashi H. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Kanayama N. Takei Y. Saga Y. Suzuki M. Itoh H. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 104: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). SKOv-3 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For all experiments in which TGF-β1 was added, cells were incubated in the serum-free medium. TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) was added either alone or in combination in cancer cells preincubated for 30 min to 1 h with pharmacological inhibitors, curcumin (20 μm, AP-1 blocker; Sigma), or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC; 100 μm; NF-κB inhibitor; Sigma). The protein concentrations in the supernatants of cell extracts were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Total RNA isolations were done using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Preparation of Conditioned Medium and Cell Lysate—The cell monolayers treated with or without various agents for the indicated times were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 1 × 106 cells were lysed in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 15 min and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 3,000 × g to remove cell debris. All samples were stored at –80 °C until use. In parallel, cells treated in the same condition in different dishes were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. Northern Blot Hybridization with cDNA Probes—Northern blot hybridization was carried out as described previously (19Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8022-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (10 μg) were separated by electrophoresis through denaturing 1.2% agarose gels containing 1% formaldehyde and transferred onto nylon or nitrocellulose membranes using standard molecular biological techniques. Hybridization was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide priming to specific activities of 0.4–0.9 × 109 cpm/μg. uPA cDNA was prepared as described (19Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8022-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Filters were reprobed with the cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to correct for the amount of RNA loaded onto the filters (19Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Suzuki M. Kobayashi H. Fujie M. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8022-8032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed on Kodak BioMax MS-1 film at –70 °C. Filters were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a Bio-Rad model 620 video densitometer with a one-dimensional Analyst software package for Macintosh. Preparation of Oligodeoxynucleotides and Lipofection of HRA Cells— Antisense ODNs were selected for sequence target to c-Src (antisense c-Src, 5′-GGG CTT GCT CTT GCT GCT CCC CAT-3′; sense c-Src, 5′-ATG GGG AGC AGC AAG AGC AAG CCC-3′) and PI3K p85 (antisense PI3K, 5′-GTA CTG GTA CCC CTC AGC ACT CAT-3′; sense PI3K, 5′-ATG AGT GCT GAG GGG TAC CAG TAC-3′) (21Morel J.C. Park C.C. Zhu K. Kumar P. Ruth J.H. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34679-34691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The corresponding sense ODN was used as control for each antisense ODN. Furthermore, each inverted antisense (iAS) oligonucleotide (iAS c-Src ODN or iAS PI3K ODN) provided additional controls for the vehicle and transfection. The ODNs were synthesized, purified, and modified with phosphorothioate. Oligonucleotides mixed with Lipofectin reagent were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the oligonucleotide-liposome complexes were then added to cells and washed twice with medium (22Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). After 8 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown for 48 h. Western Blot Analysis—Each cell was harvested, and cell pellets were lysed as described above. Centrifuged lysates (50 μg) from each cell were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry transfer. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 2% bovine serum albumin. Blots were probed with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: monoclonal anti-uPA (antibody 3471 plus 3689), anti-β-actin, anti-phospho-Src, anti-Src, anti-phospho-Akt, ant-Akt, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, or anti-ERK1/2 antibodies. This was followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000 for 1 h. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Densitometric analysis of Western blots was carried out using the Macintosh Image System. Cell Growth Assay—To examine the proliferation of each cell line, 5 × 103 cells were seeded, and the number of cells in each cell line was counted in triplicate after 24 h to assess plating efficiency. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Extracellular Matrix Invasion Assay—Chemoinvasion assays were carried out in a Boyden chamber as described (23Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The upper surface of chamber was precoated with a layer of artificial basement membrane, Matrigel. The cell suspension (1 × 105 cells/well) was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with fibroblast-conditioned medium, which acted as a chemoattractant. To measure invasion, incubation was at 37 °C for 24 h. The invaded cells in the lower side of the filter were stained with hematoxylin. Triplicate filters were used for each cell type and assay condition, and 10 random fields were counted per filter under a microscope (× 400). The experiments of inhibition of cell invasiveness were performed as follows. Because wortmannin is unstable at 37 °C in culture medium, it was added every 6 h to the upper chamber of the Matrigel invasion assay. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least three independent triplicate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. TGF-β1 Stimulates Src Phosphorylation—We have been investigating signaling pathways involved in TGF-β1 activation (4Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7790-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether TGF-β1 induces phosphorylation of Src in HRA (lanes 1–7) and SKOv-3 (lanes 8 and 9) cells by Western blot. We observed that TGF-β1 induced a marked rise in the level of phosphorylated Src protein in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). As compared with nonstimulated HRA cells, a 6-fold increase in phosphorylated Src was observed at 20 min in response to 10 ng/ml TGF-β1. The anti-Src antibodies immunoblotted similar amounts of Src protein in HRA cells, irrespective of whether cells were stimulated with TGF-β1. Furthermore, TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml, 20 min) also induces phosphorylation of Src in SKOv-3 cells (lanes 8 and 9). TGF-β1 Activates Phosphorylation of Akt through PI3K—In the previous study (4Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7790-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we observed concentration- and time-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β1 beginning with only 1 ng/ml TGF-β1. Here, we show the ability of TGF-β1 to induce Akt phosphorylation by probing Western blots of proteins from TGF-β1-stimulated HRA cells using antibodies to phosphorylated Akt or total Akt, respectively. TGF-β1 induced Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. TGF-β1 produced an early increase (230% increase at 10 min; lane 3) of PI3K/Akt activity that plateaued after 20 min (600% of base line; lane 4) and returned to base line after 60 min (lane 6) (Fig. 2, A and B). We also observed concentration-dependent phosphorylation of Akt beginning with only 0.4 ng/ml TGF-β1 (lane 3) (Fig. 2, C and D). This increase in Akt phosphorylation could be blocked when HRA cells were preincubated with wortmannin (100 nm, 1 h; lane 7) or LY294002 (10 μm, 30 min; lane 8), respectively. Pretreatment of HRA cells with 50 μm PD98059 (lane 9) also abrogated the TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. The role of PI3K in Akt activation was more specifically demonstrated through inhibition with PI3K antisense ODN. We used antisense ODN targeting of the gene for PI3K and corresponding control ODNs (S PI3K ODN and iAS PI3K ODN). We evaluate by Western blot analysis, on total cell lysate, the PI3K p85 expression after transfection experiments. As expected, Fig. 2E provides data on the extent to which PI3K p85 and Src protein expression is reduced by the antisense strategy. Furthermore, antisense PI3K ODN transfection abrogated Akt phosphorylation in HRA cells (Fig. 2C, lane 11), irrespective of whether cells were treated with TGF-β1, whereas sense PI3K ODN (Fig. 2C, lane 12) and an inverted antisense ODN (lane 13) did not. Note that TGF-β-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was not impaired by sense PI3K ODN or inverted antisense ODN. In contrast, TGF-β1-dependent Akt phosphorylation was not suppressed by p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB202190 (lane 10). TGF-β1 Stimulates Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or Akt via an Src-dependent Mechanism—Src activation has been linked to the activation of MAPK and/or PI3K in some systems (7Rak J. Filmus J. Finkenzeller G. Grugel S. Marme D. Kerbel R.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the involvement of Src in TGF-β1-induced activation of the MAPK or PI3K pathway. We found that pharmacological Src inhibitor PP2 inhibited the entire time course of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A, lane 3) and Akt (Fig. 3C, lane 3) activation by 90% (up to 2 h, data not shown), indicating that Src activation is an early event in this process. To further examine the involvement of the MAPK and PI3K pathways in TGF-β1 signaling via a Src cascade, AS ODN targeting of the gene for c-Src and corresponding control ODNs was used to treat cells with subsequent TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) stimulation. Indeed, Fig. 2E, lower panel, provides data on the extent to which Src protein expression is reduced by the antisense strategy. Antisense c-Src ODN (lane 4) caused a reduction in the level of phospho-ERK1/2 expression by 90%, apparently through specific reduction in c-Src (Fig. 3, A and B). Also, AS c-Src ODN (lane 4) inhibited phospho-Akt expression by 85% (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, S c-Src ODN (lane 5) or iAS ODN (lane 6) caused no significant effect on phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Further, general tyrosine kinase inhibition with genistein (lane 7) or herbimycin A (lane 8) significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced ERK1/2 or Akt phosphorylation as did the specific Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3). These results show that ERK1/2 and Akt down-regulation via pharmacological inhibition of Src and c-Src ODN treatment supports the critical position of Src upstream of MAPK and PI3K pathways. PI3K Is a Downstream Target of MAPK—We examined the outcome of MAPK inhibitor on TGF-β1-stimulated PI3K/Akt activation or whether PI3K inhibitors can inhibit TGF-β1-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pretreatment of HRA cells for 30 min with PD98059 (Fig. 4A, lane 3) almost completely abrogated the TGF-β1-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, pharmacological PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (Fig. 4B, lane 4) or LY294002 (lane 5) did not change TGF-β1-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that ERK1/2 is involved in the signaling route leading to Akt activation and PI3K is a downstream target of ERK1/2. Effect of Pharmacological Inhibitors on TGF-β1-induced Expression of uPA mRNA and Protein—Our previous data showed that ERK1/2 phosphorylation correlated closely with TGF-β1-induced uPA expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Western blot, and Northern blot analyses in HRA cells (4Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Kanayama N. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7790-7799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The involvement of Src, MAPK, and PI3K in this TGF-β1-stimulated functional response was assessed by the use of the pharmacological inhibitors PP2, PD98059, wortmannin, or LY294002, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 produced an increase (peak at 6 h) of uPA mRNA expression in HRA cells (lane 2). The concomitant addition of PP2 (lane 3) or PD98059 (lane 4) canceled the TGF-β1-induced increase of uPA mRNA expression by ∼95%, suggesting involvement of the Src-MAPK pathway in the TGF-β1-induced uPA synthesis. Further, the addition of wortmannin (lane 5) or LY294002 (lane 6) abrogated the TGF-β1-induced increase of uPA gene expression by 60 or 55%, respectively. In contrast, the addition of SB202190 (P38 inhibitor) did not alter the TGF-β1-induced increase of uPA gene expression (lane 7). To verify whether the above mentioned changes of the uPA gene expression were associated with changes of uPA protein expression, we estimated by Western blot the ratio of optical density of uPA protein over β-actin protein under control conditions and after administration of TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of PP2 (Fig. 5, C and D, lane 3), PD98059 (lane 4), wortmannin (lane 5), or LY294002 (lane 6). We found that TGF-β1 treatment had a significant effect on expression of the 50-kDa band corresponding to uPA in TGF-β1-stimulated HRA cells. When TGF-β1-stimulated cells were pretreated with inhibitors, we observed that treatments with PP2 (lane 3) or PD98059 (lane 4) almost completely reversed the uPA upregulation, whereas wortmannin (lane 5) or LY294002 (lane 6) inhibited the uPA protein up-regulation by 40–60% in TGF-β1-stimulated HRA cells. The addition of SB202190 (lane 7) did not alter the TGF-β1-induced increase of uPA protein expression (lane 7). These data confirm intact activation of the MAPK-PI3K signaling cascade, leading to synthesis of uPA, in response to TGF-β1 in HRA cells. Effect of"

https://openalex.org/W2064586532,"We previously reported that antiestrogen-liganded estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) transcriptionally activates the major detoxifying enzyme quinone reductase (QR) (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase). Our studies also indicate that upregulation of QR, either by overexpression or induction by tamoxifen, can protect breast cells against oxidative DNA damage caused by estrogen metabolites. We now report on the upregulation of glutathione S-transferases Pi (GST-Pi) and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase heavy subunit (GCSh) expression by antiestrogens. Studies indicate the regulation of GST-Pi and GCSh transcriptional activity by ER. While ER regulation is mediated by an electrophile response element (EpRE), we identified mechanistic differences in the involvement of other transcription factors. Regardless of these differences, ER beta-mediated regulation of GST-Pi and GCSh point towards an important role for ER beta in cellular protection against oxidative stress. A protective role is supported by our observation of inhibition of estrogen-induced DNA damage upon upregulation of GST-Pi and GCSh expression."
https://openalex.org/W2072882584,"To clarify the enzymatic property of Escherichia coli periplasmic thiol peroxidase (p20), the specific peroxidase activity toward peroxides was compared with other bacterial thiol peroxidases. p20 has the most substrate preference and peroxidase activity toward organic hydroperoxide. Furthermore, p20 exerted the most potent lipid peroxidase activity. Despite that the mutation of p20 caused the highest susceptibility toward organic hydroperoxide and heat stress, the cellular level of p20 did not respond to the exposure of oxidative stress. Expression level of p20 during anaerobic growth was sustained at the ∼50% level compared with that of the aerobic growth. Viability of aerobic p20Δ without glucose was reduced to the ∼65% level of isogenic strains, whereas viability of aerobic p20Δ with 0.5% glucose supplement was sustained. The deletion of p20 resulted in a gradual loss of the cell viability during anaerobic growth. At the stationary phase, the viability of p20Δ was down to ∼10% level of parent strains. An analysis of the protein carbonyl contents of p20Δ as a marker for cellular oxidation indicates that severe reduction of viability of anaerobic p20Δ was caused by cumulative oxidative stress. P20Δ showed hypersensitivity toward membrane-soluble organic hydroperoxides. An analysis of protein carbonyl and lipid hydroperoxide contents in the membrane of the stress-imposed p20Δ demonstrates that the severe reduction of viability was caused by cumulative oxidative stress on the membrane.

Under anaerobic conditions, it will grow by means of fermentation. However, it can also grow by means of anaerobic respiration because it is able to utilize NO3, NO2, or fumarate as final electron acceptors for respiratory electron transport processes (1Clark D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 5: 223-234PubMed Google Scholar, 2Holms H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 19: 85-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The respiratory electron transport chain is a major and continuous source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; AhpC, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; BCP, bacterioferritin-comigratory protein; TPx, thiol peroxidase; p20, periplasmic thiol peroxidase; TSA, thiol-dependent antioxidant; DTT, dithiothreitol: GS, glutamine synthetase; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; LAOOH, linoleic acid hydroperoxide. The bacteria-infected host cells induce a defense response that results in an oxidative burst with the increased generation of ROS (3Tenhaken R. Levine A. Brisson L.F. Dixon R.A. Lamb C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4158-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). ROS can also be formed by exposure of bacteria to redox-cycling chemicals present in environment or by exposure to heavy metals (4Ferri A. Calza R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 35: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar). These endogenous or exogenous sources of ROS damage many biological molecules. For example, lipid hydroperoxides can be generated from the attack of ROS to the bacterial membrane. To alleviate the oxidative damage of these compounds, E. coli induces the synthesis of a variety of antioxidant defense enzymes such as hydroperoxidases (catalases) I and II (gene products of katG and katE, respectively) that decompose H2O2 (5Lynch A.S. Lin E.C.C. Neidhardt F.C. E. coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology VI. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1526-1538Google Scholar) and superoxide dismutases (manganese superoxide dismutase, sodA; iron superoxide dismutase, sodB; and copperzinc superoxide dismutase, sodC) that eliminate superoxide anion (6Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Additional defenses in E. coli against alkyl and lipid hydroperoxides are suggested to be provided by alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (AhpC) (7Costa Seaver L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), bacterioferritin-comigratory protein (BCP) (8Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and periplasmic thiol peroxidase (p20) (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). AhpC, BCP, and p20 are all members of the ubiquitous thiol peroxidase (TPx) thiol-dependent antioxidant (TSA)/AhpC family, which are highly diverged from one another (10Poole L.B. Torres M. Fukuto J.M. Forman H.J. Signal Transduction by Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species: Pathways and Chemical Principles. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA2003: 80-101Google Scholar, 11Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). For AhpC, reduction of peroxide is achieved by a specialized electron donor, AhpF (12Poole L.B. Reynolds C.M. Wood Z.A. Karplus P.A. Ellis H.R. Li Calzi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6126-6133Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), whereas BCP and p20 receive electrons from a reducing system composed of Trx and Trx reductase (11Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 13Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Harris J.R. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2121) Google Scholar). E. coli p20 has been characterized as a periplasmic protein (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) despite the lack of a signal sequence for periplasmic transport, whereas AhpC and BCP have been localized to the cytoplasm (14Link A.J. Robison K. Church G.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Homologues of p20 are distributed throughout all Gram-negative bacteria including pathogenic bacteria (15Wan X.-Y. Zhou Y. Yan Z.-Y. Wang H.-L. Hou Y.-D. Jin D.-Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). There are several biochemical and genetic studies on p20. The p20 deletion mutants were highly susceptible to oxidative stress and displayed growth retardation after the exposure on oxidative stress (16Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies have confirmed that p20 acts as a Trx-linked peroxidase capable of reducing H2O2 and alkyl hydroperoxide and protecting against glutamine synthetase inactivation by a metal-catalyzed oxidation system (9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28635-28641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). P20 contains three Cys residues, Cys-95, Cys-82, and Cys-61, and the latter residue aligns with the N-terminal active site Cys of other peroxidases in the TSA/AhpC family. Recently, Baker et al. (17Baker L.M.S. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) identified the catalytically important Cys-61, and furthermore, as a reaction intermediate, a sulfenic acid intermediate (Cys-SOH) at Cys-61 was generated by cumene hydroperoxide treatment confirming the identity of Cys-61 as the peroxidatic center. They also demonstrated that unlike most other Cys2 TSA/AhpC that operate by an intersubunit disulfide mechanism, p20 contains a redox-active intrasubunit disulfide bond homodimeric in solution. The shared reliance on Cys-SOH formation and disulfide bond formation demonstrates mechanistic similarities between p20 and other members of the TSA/AhpC family in that the corresponding alcohol (akyl alcohol) was produced as the reaction product during the peroxidation reaction of p20 with alkyl hydroperoxide (17Baker L.M.S. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). E. coli proteomics studies by Link et al. (14Link A.J. Robison K. Church G.M. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1259-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) showed the relatively high expression of p20 during the growth phase without induction by H2O2, which indicates a sustained requirement for peroxide detoxification in the periplasmic space during growth. Periplasmic localization of TPx during the growth in relatively high level would give an advantage to a periplasmic thiol peroxidase (p20) in detoxification of peroxides prior to cytosolic entry (17Baker L.M.S. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which may indicate an in vivo function of p20 as a periplasmic thiol peroxidase of E. coli. However, the in vivo function still remains to be defined. On the basis of the substrate preference of alkyl hydroperoxides over H2O2, p20 has been suggested to act as an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. Here, for the first time, in vivo evidence is presented, indicating that p20 acts as lipid peroxidase to inhibit bacterial membrane oxidation. In addition, we demonstrate that p20 acts as principal antioxidant for E. coli during anaerobic growth Bacterial Strains and Growth of Cells—AhpC, p20, or BCP deletion mutant strains used in this experiment are our laboratory stocks described previously (8Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 16Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5610-5614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type stain is JC7623 (AB1157 recB21 recC22 sbcB15 sbcC201). Cells were grown in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) (18Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). LB medium was supplemented with 0.5% glucose or 0.05% glucose (or without glucose) for carbon-starvation culture. Aerobic growth of cells was carried out in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks, one-tenth filled, and aerated in a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were shaken in sealed anaerobic culture bottles filled to top with medium and stirred with 10 glass beads (1 mm diameter). Turbidity was measured with SPECTRONIC 20 D+ spectrophotometer at 600 nm. To calculate cell viability, appropriate dilutions of the cultures were placed on plates containing 1.5% agar and incubated at 37 °C, and colony-forming units were determined with cultures taken at the same absorbance. Various oxidative stresses or heat shock were subjected to the exponential phase cells and harvested at indicated times. Determination of TSA Activity—The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the activity to protect the inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) by a thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system (DTT, Fe3+, and O2) (thiol metal-catalyzed oxidation system) as described previously (20Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 30-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 1.0 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, various concentrations of E. coli TPx, and 10 mm DTT was incubated at 37 °C, and then 0.5 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the remaining activity of GS was determined by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. Determination of Peroxidase Activity of TPx—Peroxidase reaction was performed in 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm DTT, varying concentrations of TPx, and 50–700 μm of peroxides at 37 °C. The residual amount of peroxide was determined by FOX (ferrous oxidation in the presence of xylenol orange) assay (20Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxidase reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mm DTT. The reaction mixture was added to 1 ml of FOX I reagent and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The remaining amount of peroxide was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm. Linoleic acid hydroperoxide (LAOOH) was generated by incubating 100 μm linoleic acid with 10 μg/ml soybean lipoxidase in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 30 min. The concentration of LAOOH was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient at 234 nm of 25,000 m–1 cm–1 Cloning of Three Types of E. coli Thiol Peroxidases—Basic cloning protocols used were described in Sambrook and Russell (19Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The DNA sequences corresponding to AhpC, BCP, and p20 were obtained by PCR from E. coli genomic DNA using the forward primers (5′-GGA ATTC CATATG TCA CAA ACC GTT CAT TTC-3′ for p20, 5′-GGA ATTC CAT ATG TCC TTG ATT AAC ACC AAA-3′ for AhpC, and 5′-GGA ATTC CATATG AAT CCA CTG AAA GCC GGT-3′ for BCP) containing a NdeI (underlined) site and the initiation codon (boldface) and the reverse primers (5′-CGC GGATCCTTA TGC TTT CAG TAC AGC CAG-3′ for p20, 5′-CGC GGATCCTTA GAT TTT ACC AAC CAG GTC-3′ for AhpC, and 5′-CGC GGA TCC TCA GGC GTG TTC TTT CAG CCA-3′ for BCP) containing the BamHI site (underlined) and the stop codon (boldface). The amplified products were purified and digested with NdeI/BamHI. The digested fragments were subcloned into the T7 expression vector, pT7-7, digested with NdeI/BamHI, and the resulting plasmid was used to transform E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Expression and Purification of E. coli Thiol Peroxidase—Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C overnight in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and then transferred to fresh medium to the ratio of 1 to 250. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.4, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. After induction for 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –70 °C until use. Frozen cells were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA and disrupted by sonication. The supernatants clarified by centrifugation were used for purification of p20, AhpC, and BCP proteins. The TPx proteins were purified according to the methods reported previously (8Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2924-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Cha M.K. Kim H.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of AhpC and p20 Promoter-lacZ Fusion—To construct the AhpC or p20 promoter-lacZ fusion, the upstream sequence of the initiation codon of the BCP gene was prepared by PCR. The forward primers (5′-GGCC GGT ACC ACT GAA GCG CCG GTT CCAC-3′ for p20 and 5′-GGCC GGT ACC AGG TAA GAG CTT AGA TCA GGTG-3′ for AhpC) contain a KpnI site (underlined), and the reverse primers (5′-GGCC GGA TCC ATT ATC TTT CCT GTTTAC-3′ for p20 and 5′-GGCC GGA TCC CTA TAC TTC CTC CGT GTT TTCG-3′ for AhpC) contain a BamHII site (underlined). The KpnI/BamHI-digested PCR products were subcloned into EcoRI/BamHI-cut pRS415 (a low copy number plasmid) (22lsikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was used for transforming E. coli XL1-blue. β-Galactosidase Assay—Relative transcriptional activities of p20 and AhpC promoters were determined in terms of the expression level of lacZ reporter gene. Cells were suspended in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.0)) containing 2-mercaptoethanol and disrupted by sonication, and the expressed β-galactosidase activity was assayed using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as a artificial substrate according to the method described previously (23Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity was expressed as unit (increase of optical density at 412 nm that resulted from o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside hydrolyzed by β-galactosidase per 10 min/mg protein). Preparation of Cytosolic and Membrane Protein Extracts—10-ml samples were taken from the cultures at the indicated times, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was saved for the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and washed three times with the same buffer. The pellet was resuspended the Tris-HCl buffer containing 5% SDS and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the soluble membrane protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay for SDS-containing samples. Determination of Membrane Lipid Peroxide—45 mg of E. coli membrane pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% SDS. After sonification and two times of washing with a cold deionized water to remove SDS, the pellet was dried under vacuum at –5 °C and dissolved in 1 ml of a methanol/chloroform (2:1 v/v) solution (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The suspension was vortexed at room temperature for 1 h, and then FOX II reagent (methanol-based FOX reagent) was directly added to the suspension (21Jiang Z.Y. Woollard A.C. Wolff S.P. Lipid. 1991; 26: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). After further vortex at room temperature for 1 h, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature to obtain clear supernatant. The amount of membrane lipid peroxide was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm. Immunodetection of Protein Carbonyls—The protein carbonyl content of cytoplasmic or membrane protein extracts were detected according to the dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization method described by Levine et al. (25Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Schacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffers and separated electrophoretically on 8% acrylamide gel. The gels were then equilibrated in electrotransfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 191 mm glycine, 15% methanol) and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Following the electroblotting procedure, the nitrocellulose membranes were removed from the blotting apparatus and dried completely at room temperature. Prior to derivatization, membrane was equilibrated in 20% (v/v) methanol, 80% (v/v) Tris-buffered saline for 5 min. Continuous shaking was used during all incubation and washing steps. Membranes were incubated in 2 n HCl for 5 min. The membranes were next incubated in a solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (0.5 mm) in 2 n HCl for exactly 5 min each as described by Talent et al. (26Talent J.M. Kong Y.L. Gracy R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The membranes were washed three times in 2 n HCl (5 min each) and five times in 50% methanol for 5 min each wash. The immunodetection for protein carbonyls using anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibody was carried out according to the method described previously (26Talent J.M. Kong Y.L. Gracy R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 263: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The anti-DNP antibody was supplied by Sigma (D9656) and used at a 1/1,000 dilution. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Other Methods—Patch assays were done as described below. Aliquots (10 μl) containing varying cell numbers of an overnight culture were spotted on LB plates containing various oxidants. The plates were monitored after 1 day of incubation at 37 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). E. coli transformation, DNA, protein extraction from E. coli, and other methods not mentioned were carried out according to a supplier manual or the standard protocol. Immunoblot analysis was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p20 and AhpC. Transfer of proteins from 14% SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose blots and processing of nitrocellulose blots were carried out according to a standard protocol. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase Northern blot analyses of p20 and AhpC mRNAs were carried out according to a standard protocol. E. coli total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the resultant blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled p20 or AhpC structural gene. Periplasmic TPx (p20) Shows the Most Potent Lipid Peroxidase Activity among E. coli TPx Family—Each E. coli TSA/AhpC family (p20, BCP, and AhpC) was suggested to act as alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase (7Costa Seaver L. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 8Jeong W. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. J. Biol.

BCP and AhpC exist in the cytoplasm of bacteria regardless of Gram-negative or Gram-positive, but there is no data indicating that Gram-positive bacteria have p20. The unique presence of p20 in Gram-negative bacteria could be taken as the evidence supporting the presence of p20 in the periplasmic space. In addition, this observation suggests in vivo function of p20 as an important peroxidase to detoxify peroxides prior to cytosolic entry. However, the in vivo function still remains to be defined. As a first step toward understanding the physiological function of p20, we tried to investigate comparatively the specific activity of p20, BCP, and AhpC toward various peroxides. To our knowledge, this was the first comparative study on the peroxide substrate preference of the three types of E. coli TPx. We measured the thiol peroxidase activity toward H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and LAOOH. Fig. 1A showed that among E. coli TPx family in addition to GS protecting activity against the inactivation by metal-catalyzed oxidation system, p20 has the most potent peroxidase activity regardless kinds of peroxide. Furthermore, p20 has a high preference toward alkyl hydroperoxide as a substrate (LAOOH = t-butyl-hydroperoxide > H2O2). The over 5-fold higher LAOOH peroxidase activity of p20 to the other TPx family suggests the in vivo function of p20 as an alkyl hydroperoxidase. The ∼2× higher preference for a LAOOH over H2O2 suggests that p20 may be designed to remove the hydroperoxide linked to long chain alkyl groups such as the alkyl groups of membrane lipids. Recent crystal structure of the oxidized form of E. coli p20 supports our finding (27Choi J. Choi S. Choi J. Cha M.K. Kim I.H. Shin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49478-49486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on a modeled structure of the reduced p20 in complex with 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, it was suggested that the size and shape of the binding site are particularly suited for long chain fatty acid hydroperoxide. To investigate the in vivo antioxidant function of p20 as an alkyl hydroperoxide peroxidase, we imposed various hydroperoxides on each of E. coli TPx mutants (p20Δ, BCPΔ, and AhpCΔ) growing aerobically on LB plate. As shown in Fig. 1B, in contrast to the case of BCPΔ and AhpCΔ, p20Δ exerted the highest sensitivity toward alkyl hydroperoxides but not toward H2O2, indicating the possibility that p20 acts as an alkyl hydroperoxide-specific peroxidase. Taken together with the outstanding lipid hydroperoxide peroxidase activity of p20 when compared with AhpCΔ and p20Δ, this result suggests that p20 acts as a lipid hydroperoxide peroxidase in the periplasmic space of E. coli. P20 Is Not Oxidative Stress-inducible Protein—We have described above that exposure of p20Δ to oxidative stress remarkably reduced the cell viability. This observation suggests the possibility that p20 as an antioxidant might be induced if the cell was imposed to oxidative stress. However, to our knowledge, there is no study on transcriptional response of p20 to oxidative stress. Therefore, we investigated the response of p20 to oxidative stress. To investigate p20 transcriptional response to oxidative stress, exponentially growing cells were exposed to various oxidants (paraquat, H2O2, t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, and diamide) for 30 min and transcriptional activities of p20 and AhpC in terms of the β-galactosidase activity expressed under control of the p20 promoter were analyzed. As a positive control, transcriptional activity of AhpC under control of OxyR transcription factor was also examined because it is well known that the transcriptional level of AhpC is sharply induced in response to oxidative stress (28Storz G. Tartaglia L.A. Ames B.N. Science. 1990; 248: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that transcriptional activity of p20 was insensitive to the exposure of various oxidative stresses, but as expected, that of AhpC was remarkably induced, exerting the concentration dependence. To confirm this result in vivo, we also directly determined the mRNA levels by Northern blot. The level of AhpC mRNA was greatly increased in response to diamide, whereas the level of p20 mRNA did not significantly respond to the oxidant throughout the concentrations tested (Fig. 2B). The immunoblot analysis for p20 and AhpC in the same experimental condition described above indicates that, in contrast to AhpC, p20 protein levels did not changed upon exposure to various oxidants such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, paraquat, and diamide (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that p20 is not a oxidative stress-inducible protein. P20 Is Necessary for Survival of E. coli against Heat Stress—As an another approach to investigate in vivo function of p20 in E. coli, heat shock as an oxidative stress-induced process was subjected to three log-phased E. coli TPx mutants (p20Δ, BCPΔ, and AhpCΔ) by elevating culture temperature from 30 to 51 °C and the cell viabilities were comparatively investigated. Heat-stressed cells were plated on LB plate, and the cell viability was measured in terms of the number of the survival colonies. Fig. 3A showed viabilities of the three types of mutant as a function of the exposed time at 51 °C. An analysis of the viability data indicates that deletion of p20 in E. coli gave the most harmful effect on the survival against the heat stress. An analysis of protein carbonyl contents of the p20Δ using DNP antibody as a marker for cellular oxidation shown in Fig. 3B suggests that the severe reduction of the viability of heat-stressed p20Δ is caused by cumulative oxidative stress. Deletion of BCP (data not shown) and AhpC did not result in significant increases of protein carbonyl contents when compared with their isogenic strains, which is consistent with the viability data. To see more clearly the protein oxidation pattern, two-dimensional electrophoresis was used for the sepa"
https://openalex.org/W1981367433,"The glutathione transferases (GSTs) represent a superfamily of dimeric proteins. Each subunit has an active site, but there is no evidence for the existence of catalytically active monomers. The lock and key motif is responsible for a highly conserved hydrophobic interaction in the subunit interface of pi, mu, and alpha class glutathione transferases. The key residue, which is either Phe or Tyr (Tyr50 in human GSTP1-1) in one subunit, is wedged into a hydrophobic pocket of the other subunit. To study how an essentially inactive subunit influences the activity of the neighboring subunit, we have generated the heterodimer composed of subunits from the fully active human wild-type GSTP1-1 and the nearly inactive mutant Y50A obtained by mutation of the key residue Tyr50 to Ala. Although the key residue is located far from the catalytic center, the kcat value of mutant Y50A decreased about 1300-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. The decrease of the kcat value of the heterodimer by about 27-fold rather than the expected 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme indicates that the two active sites of the dimeric enzyme work synergistically. Further evidence for cooperativity was found in the nonhyperbolic GSH saturation curves. A network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules, found in crystal structures of GSTP1-1, connects the two active sites and the main chain carbonyl group of Tyr50, thereby offering a mechanism for communication between the two active sites. It is concluded that a subunit becomes catalytically competent by positioning the key residue of one subunit into the lock pocket of the other subunit, thereby stabilizing the loop following the helix α2, which interacts directly with GSH. The glutathione transferases (GSTs) represent a superfamily of dimeric proteins. Each subunit has an active site, but there is no evidence for the existence of catalytically active monomers. The lock and key motif is responsible for a highly conserved hydrophobic interaction in the subunit interface of pi, mu, and alpha class glutathione transferases. The key residue, which is either Phe or Tyr (Tyr50 in human GSTP1-1) in one subunit, is wedged into a hydrophobic pocket of the other subunit. To study how an essentially inactive subunit influences the activity of the neighboring subunit, we have generated the heterodimer composed of subunits from the fully active human wild-type GSTP1-1 and the nearly inactive mutant Y50A obtained by mutation of the key residue Tyr50 to Ala. Although the key residue is located far from the catalytic center, the kcat value of mutant Y50A decreased about 1300-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme. The decrease of the kcat value of the heterodimer by about 27-fold rather than the expected 2-fold in comparison with the wild-type enzyme indicates that the two active sites of the dimeric enzyme work synergistically.

Glutathione transferases catalyze the nucleophilic addition of the thiol of reduced glutathione (GSH, γGlu-Cys-Gly) to a wide variety of endogenous and exogenous hydrophobic electrophiles including alkyl and aryl halides, epoxides, quinones, and activated alkenes. The glutathione S-conjugates of these compounds are more polar thus facilitating their elimination. Cytosolic mammalian GSTs can be classified, based on amino acid sequences, into at least eight distinct classes: alpha, mu, pi (9Mannervik B. Ålin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M.

The sequence identities between any two members within a class are typically greater than 70% and usually less than 30% between classes (1Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev.

The three-dimensional structures of members of six GST classes have been determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis. Each subunit is composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain (domain I) that adopts a thioredoxin-like fold and an all α-helical C-terminal domain (domain II). There are at least two ligand-binding sites per subunit: the glutathione-binding site (G-site), which is very specific for GSH and the hydrophobic substrate-binding site (H-site), which can bind a large variety of different electrophiles (18Mannervik B. Guthenberg C. Jakobson I. Warholm M. Aitio A. Conjugation Reaction in Drug Biotransformation: Glutathione Conjugation: Reaction Mechanism of Glutathione S-Transferase A. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1978: 101-110Google Scholar). The G-site is constructed mainly from residues of the N-terminal domain, whereas the H-site has major contributions from the C-terminal domain. While the functional properties of the amino acid residues making up the G-site of a GST are generally conserved among different classes, the residues forming the hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket vary considerably among different GSTs. Since the structure of the H-site governs the substrate specificity of a particular GST, diversity in the H-site gives the GST family the ability to catalyze reactions toward an exceedingly large number of structurally diverse substrates. Although all soluble GSTs have very similar overall polypeptide folds, each class exhibits unique features, particularly about the active site and at the C terminus (8Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar, 19Wilce M.C.J. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 20Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). For alpha and theta class enzymes, the C terminus forms a well defined α-helical structure that shields the active site and plays an important role in catalysis through the control of product release. For the mu class enzymes the C terminus forms an Ω-loop that partially covers the active site. Another salient feature of mu and pi class enzymes is found in the segment that links strand β2 to helix α2. In mu class enzymes, this segment forms an extended solvent-exposed loop (mu-loop) that partially shields the active site. The corresponding segment in pi class enzymes is a short helix that is considered to be part of helix α2 (Fig. 1). Helix α2, which is formed by residues 36-52, is highly flexible in pi class GSTs, and influences the catalytic activity of the enzymes. Although data obtained so far indicate that the flexibility of the highly mobile helix α2 of the pi class enzymes modulates GSH binding and catalysis, it is not clear how the mobility of this helix influences the rate of catalysis. Although the substrate binding to one subunit of wild-type GSTP1-1 does not alter the catalytic properties of the other subunit at a physiological temperature, some mutations of amino acid residues forming helix α2 induce cooperativity in GSH binding. Mutants G42A, C48S, and K55A display positive cooperativity (21Ricci G. Lo Bello M. Caccuri A.M. Pastore A. Nuccetelli M. Parker M.W. Federici G. J. Biol.

The structural effect in one G-site was assumed to be transmitted to the second one through Tyr50 and helix α4, which are located at the dimer interface. Although each subunit of dimeric GSTs has a G-site and an H-site, which together form the catalytic active center, there is no evidence for the existence of catalytically active monomers in nature. Abdalla et al. (25Abdalla A.M. Bruns C.M. Tainer J.A. Mannervik B. Stenberg G.

To date it is not clear whether the dimeric form is functionally essential in catalysis or not. Analyses of crystal structures of pi, mu, and alpha class glutathione transferases (26Reinemer P.

Their subunit interfaces involve three types of interactions: polar contacts and hydrogen bonds between electrophilic amino acids, stacking of two symmetrically equivalent arginines (one from each subunit) (7Hayes J.D.

In the lock and key motif an aromatic residue (key residue) from domain I in one subunit is wedged into a hydrophobic pocket formed by helices α4 and α5 in domain II of the other subunit (Fig. 1). The lock and key motif is a common feature of pi, mu, and alpha class glutathione transferases and the key residue is either phenylalanine or tyrosine (Tyr50 in hGSTP1-1). Mutagenesis has been used to investigate the importance of the key residue for dimerization and stability of GSTP1-1 (29Stenberg G. Abdullah A-M. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), GSTA1-1 (30Sayed Y. Wallace L.A. Dirr H.

Codreanu S.G. Armstrong R.N. Dirr H.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14238-14247Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The generation of heterodimeric proteins provides a new approach to studying the amino acid residues that are important in subunit interactions and to probe the influence of one subunit on the activity of the other subunit. Tyrosine 50 in GSTP1-1 may play both a structural role as the key residue and a functional role as part of the flexible helix α2. Thus, in the present study we have generated the heterodimer composed of subunits from wild-type GSTP1-1 and mutant Y50A to investigate the importance of residue Tyr50 in dimerization, stability and catalytic activity, and the influence of one essentially inactive subunit on the activity of the neighboring subunit in the heterodimer. The latent cooperativity previously observed in GSTP1-1 was also investigated. Expression and Purification of Wild-type GSTP1-1 and Histidine-tagged Mutant Y50A—Wild-type GSTP1-1 and histidine-tagged mutant Y50A were expressed in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue in presence of 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C as described by Kolm et al. (33Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by ultrasonication. GSTP1-1 was purified by affinity chromatography as described by Kolm et al. (33Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) by using S-hexylglutatione-Sepharose 6B as affinity matrix instead of S-hexylglutatione-Sepharose 4B, while the mutant Y50A was purified by using Ni-IMAC, eluted with 0.5 m imidazole in 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.02%, w/v, NaN3 and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. The purity of enzymes was analyzed by 20% homogeneous native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and isoelectric focusing (IEF) using precast gels (Amersham Biosciences PhastSystem). Heterodimer GSTP1/Y50A Preparation and Purification—The heterodimer GSTP1/Y50A was prepared by mixing 3.4 mg/ml each of GSTP1-1 and mutant Y50A and incubating the mixture in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 3.5 m GdnHCl and 2 mm DTT at 4 °C overnight with moderate shaking. The buffer constituents of the mixture were changed by gel filtration to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 (buffer A). GSTP1/Y50A was purified in two consecutive chromatographic steps using glutatione-Sepharose 4B and Ni-IMAC. After passing the mixture through glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 10 °C with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min, the fractions containing GSTP1/Y50A were collected as wash (buffer A), while GSTP1-1 was collected as eluate (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 5 mmS-hexylglutatione, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 0.02%, w/v, NaN3). The wash fraction containing GSTP1/Y50A was passed through Ni-IMAC at 10 °C with a flow rate of 1 ml/min, after dialysis against 20 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.085 m imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 0.02%, w/v, NaN3 (buffer B). GSTP1/Y50A and mutant Y50A were eluted with 0.2 m and 0.5 m imidazole, respectively in buffer B. Purified GSTP1/Y50A was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 0.02%, w/v, NaN3 and stored at -80 °C. The purity of GSTP1/Y50A was found to be homogeneous by 20% native PAGE and IEF. Enzyme Assay—The specific activity of GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A was determined by a spectrophotometric assay in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5, at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB (34Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Steady-state Kinetic Parameters—Steady-state kinetics of GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A and mutant Y50A were carried out, at a constant GSH concentration of 10 mm, by varying CDNB concentration from 0.08 to 2 mm or varying PEITC concentration from 0.01 to 0.08 mm. All measurements were performed in triplicate measurements in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5 for CDNB and pH 6.0 for PEITC, at 30 °C. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data using the SIMFIT package (35Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Temperature Effect on Cooperativity of GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A—Steady-state kinetics for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A were carried out in triplicate measurements at 20, 30, and 40 °C in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5, at constant CDNB concentration of 1 mm, and varying GSH concentrations from 0.1 to 10 mm. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the 1:1 Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data using the SIMFIT package. The Hill coefficient was calculated from the slope of Hill plot according to Equation 1,Y=υi/Vmax=[S]h/(K+[S]h)(Eq. 1) where vi is the initial velocity at nonsaturating substrate concentrations; Vmax is the maximum velocity at saturating substrate concentrations; [S] is the substrate concentration; K is the substrate concentration corresponding to the half-enzyme saturation; and h is the Hill coefficient. According to the Hill equation, values of h may vary from 1, indicating no cooperativity, to a maximum value, corresponding to the number of interacting subunits (2 for GSTP1-1 dimer) and indicating infinite positive cooperativity, or to lower than 1 indicating negative cooperativity. Inhibition Studies—The I50 values for each inhibitor for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A were determined by measuring the specific activities at 30 °C in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5, in the presence of 1 mm GSH, 1 mm CDNB, and different concentrations of inhibitor. I50 values were calculated as the concentration of inhibitor that gives 50% of the reaction rate of the uninhibited reaction. Temperature Effect on the I50 Value—The I50 values for S-p-bromobenzyl glutathione for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A were determined by measuring the specific activities at 20, 30, and 40 °C in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5, in the presence of 0.33 mm GSH, 1 mm CDNB, and different concentrations of inhibitor. Reactivation—The enzymatic activity of GSTP1-1 (4.7 mg/ml) and GSTP1/Y50A (0.156 mg/ml) was measured in the standard assay system after incubating the enzyme with different concentrations of GdnHCl (0-3.0 m) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 2 mm DTT for 2 h at 4 °C and after removal of GdnHCl by gel filtration. Thermal Stability—The thermal stability of GSTP1-1 (0.0021 mg/ml) and GSTP1/Y50A (0.078 mg/ml) was examined by incubating the enzyme fractions in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 40 mm GSH, 5 mm DTT, and 0.02%, w/v, NaN3, at 50 °C for different time periods. The enzymatic activity was then measured in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 6.5, at 30 °C in the presence of 1 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB. Preparation and Purification of GSTP1-1, Mutant Y50A, and GSTP1/Y50A—GSTP1-1 and histidine-tagged mutant Y50A were expressed in E. coli at 37 °C and purified in a single chromatographic step using S-hexylglutatione-Sepharose 6B and Ni-IMAC columns, respectively. A total yield of 40 mg of protein per liter culture was obtained both with GSTP1-1 and with mutant Y50A. The specific activity of purified GSTP1-1 and mutant Y50A was determined as 100 and 0.004 μmol min-1 mg-1, respectively, using CDNB as the electrophilic substrate (Table I). Histidine-tagged wild type was constructed and kinetically characterized to estimate the histidine-tag effect on kinetic properties of enzyme. The kinetic properties of the histidine-tagged wild type did not differ significantly from unmodified wild-type enzyme (Stenberg et al., Ref. 29Stenberg G. Abdullah A-M. Mannervik B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The preparation of heterodimeric GSTP1/Y50A gave a yield 34% of total protein and a specific activity of 1 μmol min-1 mg-1 (Table I). GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A appeared as single bands in IEF gel and 20% homogeneous native PAGE (data not shown).Table ISpecific activities for purified GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and Y50A mutantSpecific activityμmol min−1 mg−1aAll values are means based on 3 replicates.GSTP1-1100 ± 3GSTP1/Y50A1 ± 0.05Y50A0.004 ± 0.0001a All values are means based on 3 replicates.

As shown in Table II, KmCDNB of GSTP1/Y50A increased 3-fold and decreased 4-fold in comparison with GSTP1-1 and mutant Y50A, respectively, while KmPEITC for GSTP1/Y50A was the same as for GSTP1-1. kcatCDNB for GSTP1/Y50A decreased 27-fold and increased 50-fold with reference to GSTP-1 and mutant Y50A, respectively. Also kcatPEITC for GSTP1/Y50A decreased 140-fold compared with GSTP1-1. kcat/KmCDNB for the heterodimer decreased 89-fold and increased 200-fold with regard to GSTP1-1 and mutant Y50A, respectively, and kcat/KmPEITC decreased 122-fold compared with GSTP1-1.Table IISteady state kinetic parameters for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and Y50A mutantVaried substrateKinetic parameteraParameter values ± S.E. were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of experimental data.GSTP1-1GSTP1/Y50AY50ACDNBVmax (μmol·min−1 mg−1)157 ± 55.5 ± 0.40.122 ± 0.09kcat (S−1)120 ± 14.5 ± 0.30.09 ± 0.03KM (mm)0.56 ± 0.051.7 ± 0.27.3 ± 3.5kcat/KM (S−1·mm−1)214 ± 1.42.4 ± 0.010.012 ± 0.001PEITCVmax (μmol·min−1 mg−1)110 ± 100.7 ± 0.3NDbND, not determined.kcat (S−1)84 ± 3.60.6 ± 0.12NDKM (mm)0.08 ± 0.010.07 ± 0.06NDkcat/KM (S−1·mm−1)1050 ± 418.6 ± 0.24NDa Parameter values ± S.E. were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of experimental data.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Temperature Effects on the Km Value for GSH as Varied Substrate for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and Mutant Y50A—The mutation at position 50, which is located on the loop forming one wall of the G-site, may distort the conformation of the active site. kcat and KmGSH values were determined at 20, 30, and 40 °C for GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A. As shown in an Eadie-Hofstee plot (Fig. 2C), the GSH saturation of mutant Y50A is markedly concave-up at all three temperatures. The GSH saturation of GSTP1/Y50A is slightly concave-up at 30 °C (Fig. 2B). This nonhyperbolic behavior increases at 20 °C and disappears at 40 °C. For GSTP1-1, the GSH binding is hyperbolic from 20 to 30 °C but concave-down at 40 °C (Fig. 2A). At 30 °C, the KmGSH value of GSTP1/Y50A is 5 times higher than that of GSTP1-1 but 12 times lower than that of mutant Y50A (Table III). kcat of GSTP1/Y50A at 30 °C temperature is 59 times lower than that of GSTP1-1 but 6 times higher than that of mutant Y50A. By increasing the temperature from 20 to 40 °C, KmGSH and kcat values of GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A increase but KmGSH of mutant Y50A decreases. kcat of mutant Y50A increases with increasing temperature from 20 to 30 °C, but decreases with increasing temperature from 30 to 40 °C.Table IIITemperature effect on GSH saturation of GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and Y50A mutantKinetic parameteraParameter values ± S.E. were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data.20°C30°C40°CGSTP1-1kcat73.6 ± 0.4105.8 ± 0.37123.7 ± 1.13KM0.16 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.010.43 ± 0.03h0.85 ± 0.031.06 ± 0.051.18 ± 0.04GSTP1/Y50Akcat1.56 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.012.13 ± 0.01KM0.96 ± 0.071 ± 0.071.3 ± 0.06h0.79 ± 0.020.86 ± 0.020.97 ± 0.02Y50Akcat0.14 ± 0.0030.29 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.007KM15 ± 2.111.8 ± 2.14.5 ± 0.7h0.66 ± 0.010.67 ± 0.020.69 ± 0.02a Parameter values ± S.E. were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data. Open table in a new tab Temperature Effect on Cooperativity of GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A—Fig. 2A shows that GSTP1-1 changes from apparent “kinetic” negative cooperativity, to non-cooperativity and positive cooperativity at 20, 30, and 40 °C, respectively, i.e. Hill coefficient values are 0.85, 1, and 1.18, respectively (Table III). On the other hand, GSTP1/Y50A displays negative cooperativity below 40 °C and non-cooperativity at 40 °C (inset of Fig. 2B), i.e. Hill coefficient values are 0.79, 0.86, and 0.97 at 20, 30, and 40 °C, respectively (Table III). Mutant Y50A displays negative cooperativity at all temperatures tested, (inset of Fig. 2C), i.e. Hill coefficient values are 0.66, 0.67, and 0.69 at 20, 30, and 40 °C, respectively (Table III). Inhibition Studies—The effects of different inhibitors of GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A were determined (Table IV). GSH and CDNB were used as substrates. The difference between I50 values of GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A is not pronounced for different GSH analogs (Fig. 3), but significant for Cibacron Blue (Table IV). Cibacron Blue is a strongly inhibitory electrophilic substrate analog (36Tahir M.K. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. FEBS. 1985; 181: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which probes other binding sites than do the GSH derivatives; its saturation curves showed no cooperativity. GSTP1/Y50A is less sensitive than GSTP1-1 to all inhibitors. Although GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A do not demonstrate cooperativity with the different inhibitors, the mutant Y50A displays marked negative cooperativity with GSH derivatives. Thus, the fractional activity of mutant Y50A inhibited by GSH analogs can be modeled with two different I50 values apparently accounting for the activity of two subunits with different sensitivities to the inhibitor. Both of these values are higher than those of GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50A. The I50 values for S-p-bromobenzyl glutathione of GSTP1-1, GSTP1/Y50A, and mutant Y50A increase with increasing temperature, but the mode of cooperativity is not affected by the temperature change (data not shown).Table IVEffect of different inhibitors on GSTP1-1 and GSTP1/Y50AInhibitorGSTP1-1 I50GSTP1/Y50A I50Y50AaTwo-binding-site function.I50AI50BμmμmμmμmS-Hexyl glutathione2231NDbND, not determined.NDS-p-Bromobenzyl glutathione1112321.6 × 105Glutathione sulfonic acid45622011.1 × 107Cibacron blue0.330.83NDNDa Two-binding-site function.b ND, not determined."

Because of the roles of gap-junctional channels in development, organ function, and disease processes and the possible physiological and pathophysiological roles of gap-junctional hemichannels (see Ref. 2Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is considerable interest in understanding the structure and regulation of connexons. Despite all the effort devoted to study connexins, basic aspects of the structure and function of the protein remain unknown. The connexin 43 isoform (Cx43) 1The abbreviations used are: Cx43, connexin 43 isoform; Cx43D2, rat Cx43 DNA with a partial deletion at the C-terminal domain; CL Cx43D2, Cys-less Cx43D2; CF, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; PKC, protein kinase C. is expressed in organs such as the brain, myocardium, and kidney as well as in capillary endothelial cells (16Beyer E.C.

A medium resolution structure of this connexin, without the C-terminal domain, has been solved by cryoelectron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals (4Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 5Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.M. Yeager M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These structural studies, however, have not provided unambiguous information on helix packing, the residues that form the pore, or the structure of the regulatory C-terminal domain. Studies in which native residues were substituted with Cys and then reacted with thiol reagents, however, suggest that transmembrane segments 1, 2, and 3 (M1–M3) are the helices lining the pore (23Zhou X.W.

J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These studies show the power of the combination of biochemical and functional studies to address specific structural aspects of connexins. However, a major limitation for the interpretation of those studies is that Cys mutagenesis was performed on a protein that contains nine native Cys residues. Therefore, effects that depend on reaction of the thiol reagents with the native Cys residues cannot be ruled out. Independently of the future success of structural studies, detailed biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies will also be needed to elucidate how connexins work. This is because both dynamic studies and studies under native conditions are necessary but impossible to perform in crystals of membrane transport proteins. Important structural information can be obtained from the combined use of highly specific sulfhydryl reagents and recombinant DNA technology that allows for the placement of Cys residues at locations of interest in an otherwise Cys-less protein. It has been shown that Cys residues located in the extracellular loops of Cx43 are essential for the docking of connexons from adjacent cells and thus for the formation of functional gap-junctional channels (26Dahl G. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Werner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 172-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Six Cys residues, three on each extracellular loop, are highly conserved in the connexin family, and it has been shown that four Cys residues form intramolecular disulfide bonds without inter-connexin bonds (28Dupont E. el Aoumari A. Briand J.P. Fromaget C. Gros D. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 108: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29John S.A. Revel J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1312-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Rahman S. Evans W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 100: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the extracellular loops form a stacked antiparallel β-sheet structure connected by these interloop disulfide bonds, forming finger-like structures that interdigitate with the equivalent loops from the opposing connexon to form the gap-junctional channel (see Refs. 2Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 31Foote C.I. Zhou L. Zhu X. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This results in a highly packed structure impermeable even to small solutes, isolating the intercellular channel from the extracellular space. Although the studies described above show that Cys-less connexins should not form gap-junctional channels (26Dahl G. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Werner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 172-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Foote C.I. Zhou L. Zhu X. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), it is still possible that Cys-less connexins form hemichannels. Several studies have shown that connexin hemichannels constitute a good simple model of the gap-junctional channels (see Ref. 2Harris A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 325-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the research presented here, we explore the hypothesis that the conserved, as well as the non-conserved, connexin Cys residues are not necessary for Cx43 to form functional hemichannels. To generate the Cys-less Cx43 (CL Cx43D2), we used a rat Cx43 DNA with a partial deletion at the C-terminal domain (Cx43D2). Details on the proteins studied are schematically presented in Fig. 1. We have recently shown that Cx43D2, i.e. Cx43 with partial deletion of the C-terminal domain (deleted residues underlined in Fig. 1) forms connexons that are permeable to hydrophilic organic solutes just like those formed by full-length wild-type Cx43 (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This was assessed from the magnitude of the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) flux and its regulation by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Because Cx43D2 lacks two Cys residues (Fig. 1) that are not essential for CF permeation or the regulation of CF permeability by PKC-mediated phosphorylation (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar), we decided to engineer the Cys-less Cx43 variant from Cx43D2. CL Cx43D2 was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis of the Cx43D2 DNA, using the QuikChange multisite site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). We used the following mutagenic primers (mutated bases underlined): 5′-GCCTTTCGCGCTAACACTCAACAACCTGGCGCCGAAAACGTCGCCTATGACAAGTC C-3′ (for Cys54, Cys61, and Cys65), 5′-GTCTACAC CGCCAAGAGAGATCCCGCCCCTCACCAGGTAGACGCCTTCCTCTCACG-3′ (for Cys187, Cys192, and Cys198), and 5′-CACCACTGGCACTAGCGCTTCCTCACCAACGGC-3′ (for Cys271). The mutant CL Cx43D2-I34C was also generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the primer 5′-GCTCTTCATATTCAGATGCCTGCTCCTGGGG-3′ (mutated bases underlined). Isolation of Xenopus laevis oocytes, synthesis of cRNA, and oocyte injection were performed as described (33Button B. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Oocytes were generally injected with 7.4 ng of antisense Cx38 oligonucleotide (to reduce endogenous expression of Cx38 (34Ebihara L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 742-748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) alone or with 15 ng of Cx43 cRNA. Control experiments were performed in water-injected oocytes. To record the junctional current (Ij) the oocytes were injected with 1–2 ng of Cx43, Cx43D2, or CL Cx43D2 cRNA plus antisense Cx38. The cells were incubated in Barth’s solution for 24 h and then exposed to a hypertonic solution (200 mm potassium aspartate, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5) for 10 min before the vitelline membrane was mechanically removed, as described previously (35Methfessel C. Witzemann V. Takahashi T. Mishina M. Numa S. Sakmann B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The oocytes were then paired with the vegetal poles facing each other and incubated in Barth’s solution for 4–48 h prior to the electrophysiological measurements using the dual two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique (36Spray D.C. Harris A.L. Bennett M.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 1–2 megohm when immersed in ND 96 solution (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, and 5 Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4). The two cells of a pair were clamped at –60 mV, and a transjunctional potential was generated by stepping the voltage of one oocyte from –60 mV while holding the voltage in the other at –60 mV. The current supplied to the cell maintained at –60 mV was equal in amplitude but opposite in sign to Ij, and the transjunctional voltage (Vj) was equal to the voltage difference between the voltage-clamped cell pair. Four-s Vj steps were from –120 to 120 mV at 20-mV intervals, with the voltage of the cell clamped at –60 mV as reference. Uptake of CF into the cells, SDS-PAGE, and Western blots of biotinylated plasma membranes were performed as described (33Button B. Reuss L. Altenberg G.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). The thiol reagent maleimidobutyrylbiocytin was obtained from Calbiochem and was added to the bathing solution to a final concentration of 100 μm during the exposure to CF. Fig. 2A displays typical records of the gap-junctional currents measured in paired oocytes expressing Cx43, Cx43D2, or CL Cx43D2. As expected, significant gap-junctional currents were observed in the oocytes injected with Cx43. Junctional currents were also detected in the oocytes injected with the Cx43 deletion mutant Cx43D2. This observation supports our previous conclusion that this deletion mutant is functional (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). I-V plots of the Ij values measured 4 s after changing Vj are shown in Fig. 2B. These results clearly show that Cx43 and Cx43D2 form gap-junctional channels. However, it is also evident that the current kinetics are different in cell pairs expressing Cx43 or Cx43D2. The junctional current elicited by 120 mV pulses in oocyte pairs expressing Cx43 was well fit by two exponentials of τ = 110 ± 19 ms and τ = 8.3 ± 1.3 s (n = 13), denoting fast and slow junctional voltage gating, respectively. This is in agreement with previous studies (37Revilla A. Castro C. Barrio L.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 38Moreno A.P. Chanson M. Elenes S. Anumonwo J. Scerri I. Gu H. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, a single exponential fit of τ similar to that of the slow gating of Cx43 channels (τ = 5.9 ± 1.9 s, n = 6) fits well the time course of the junctional current elicited by a 120-mV pulse in oocyte pairs expressing Cx43D2. Therefore, the difference in current kinetics can be explained by a loss of fast gating in the Cx43D2 deletion mutant channels. Similar changes were described in gap junctions formed by Cx43 truncated at Ser257 (essentially complete C-terminal domain deletion; see Ref. 37Revilla A. Castro C. Barrio L.C. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1374-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and by Cx43 with a green fluorescent protein variant (EGFP) fused to the end of the C-terminal domain (39Bukauskas F.F. Bukauskiene A. Bennet M.V. Verselis V.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 137-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, our results confirm the conclusion that the C-terminal domain is involved in the fast junctional voltage gating of Cx43. Fig. 2A also shows that junctional currents were not detected in the CL Cx43D2-expressing oocytes (similar to the water-injected cells, not shown), although CL Cx43D2 was expressed at the plasma membrane, as shown by the Western blots of membranes biotinylated by a cell membrane-impermeable reagent (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that CL Cx43D2 is expressed at the plasma membrane and does not form functional gap-junctional channels. This is the case because the Cys residues of the extracellular loops are necessary for connexon docking (26Dahl G. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Werner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Biophys. J. 1992; 62: 172-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 31Foote C.I. Zhou L. Zhu X. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The possibility exists that CL Cx43D2, expressed at the plasma membrane, is not functional as a hemichannel. Because the expression level of Cx43 hemichannels in oocytes is not sufficient to produce detectable currents, we addressed the functional state of CL Cx43D2 by measuring the CF uptake (40Bao X.

The CF influx in the absence of Cx43 activation is very low, whereas the background oocyte currents are larger than the expected Cx43 hemichannel currents. Fig. 3A shows that in oocytes expressing Cx43D2, inhibition of PKC by calphostin C elicits an increase in CF permeability, which results in a larger CF uptake, confirming recent observations from our laboratory (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). This regulation by PKC-mediated phosphorylation is similar to that described for gap-junctional channels (32Lampe P.D. Lau A.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) and is present in both Cx43 and Cx43D2 (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Fig. 3A also shows that a similar PKC-regulated CF permeability is observed in oocytes expressing CL Cx43D2, suggesting that CL Cx43D2 forms functional hemichannels. To confirm the involvement of CL Cx43D2 hemichannels in the permeability to CF, we carried out additional experiments on a mutant in which a Cx43 residue thought to contribute to the pore lining (Ile34 homologous to Cx32 Ile33; see Ref. 23Zhou X.W. Pfahnl A. Werner R. Hudder A. Llanes A. Luebke A. Dahl G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was substituted with a Cys. Fig. 3B shows that this mutant also shows PKC-regulated CF permeability similar to that of CL Cx43D2. Exposure to the thiol reagent MBB (Mr 538) blocks the calphostin C-induced CF permeability in CL Cx43D2-I34C, whereas the reagent does not affect it in the CL Cx43D2. Our results indicate that CL Cx43D2 forms functional hemichannels and therefore none of the Cys residues is essential for Cx43 synthesis, processing, or targeting to the plasma membrane. Although, as expected (26Dahl G. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C. Werner R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Dahl G. Werner R. Levine E. Rabadan-Diehl C.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the CL Cx43D2 hemichannels cannot dock with the hemichannels from an adjacent cell to form gap junctions, they are regulated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation similarly to hemichannels formed by wild-type Cx43 (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Recently we presented compelling evidence supporting the notion that in frog oocytes injected with Cx43 cRNA, CF uptake occurs through Cx43 gap-junctional hemichannels (40Bao X. Altenberg G.A. Reuss L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). However, blockers of gap-junctional channels and gap-junctional hemichannels are not specific, and it is possible that changes in Cx43 expression alter the expression of other pathways that can mediate the uptake of organic solutes of Mr < 1000. Previous electrophysiological experiments using the combination of Cys scanning mutagenesis and the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent maleimidobutyrylbiocytin have shown that Ile-34 faces the hydrophilic pore of the Cx43 hemichannels (23Zhou X.W. Pfahnl A. Werner R. Hudder A. Llanes A. Luebke A. Dahl G. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1946-1953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our results showing that exposure to maleimidobutyrylbiocytin specifically blocks CF uptake in cells expressing CL Cx43D2-I34C, without an effect on CL Cx43D2-expressing oocytes, demonstrate that the CF flux into the cells is via the hemichannels. The observations that CL Cx43D2 is expressed at the plasma membrane as functional hemichannels with PKC-regulated CF permeability indicate that this protein constitutes an excellent experimental system to exploit the thiol-specific chemistry to test structural models of Cx43, study helix packing, inter-connexin associations, and regulatory conformational changes, and identify residues lining the channel pore.

https://openalex.org/W2011495449,"Eukaryotic cells have developed specific mechanisms to overcome environmental stress. Here we show that the Src homology 2/3 (SH2/SH3) domain-containing protein Nck-1 prevents the unfolded protein response normally induced by pharmacological endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress agents. Overexpression of Nck-1 enhances protein translation, whereas it abrogates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation and inhibition of translation in response to tunicamycin or thapsigargin treatment. Nck-1 overexpression also attenuates induction of the ER chaperone, the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), and impairs cell survival in response to thapsigargin. We provided evidence that in these conditions, the effects of Nck on the unfolded protein response (UPR) involve its second SH3 domain and a calyculin A-sensitive phosphatase activity. In addition, we demonstrated that protein translation is reduced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking both Nck isoforms and is enhanced in similar cells expressing high levels of Nck-1. In these various mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we also provided evidence that Nck modulates the activation of the ER resident eIF2α kinase PERK and consequently the phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 in response to stress. Our study establishes that Nck is required for optimal protein translation and demonstrates that, in addition to its adaptor function in mediating signaling from the plasma membrane, Nck also mediates signaling from the ER membrane compartment.

These conditions include heat shock, hypoxia, glucose deprivation, genetic defects that alter protein structure, and pharmacological compounds affecting protein folding. To overcome environmental stress, all eukaryotic cells have developed specific mechanisms in order to maintain ER functions and to promote cell survival. This is achieved by ER-resident molecular machines involved in the activation of at least two distinct signaling pathways that contribute to a proper folding environment in the ER (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 2Kaufman R.J. Scheuner D. Schroder M. Shen X. Lee K. Liu C.Y. Arnold S.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). In particular, these pathways lead to transcriptional induction of genes encoding ER chaperones and disulfide exchange proteins (3Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar), and to inhibition of translation initiation (4Brostrom C.O. Brostrom M.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 79-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) through phosphorylation of eIF2α by the ER-resident kinase PERK (5Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Together, these events form what is defined as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen induces transcription of a large set of genes, many of which encode proteins that function to increase the volume and capacity for either protein folding or the degradation of misfolded proteins (6Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). For instance, transcription of the ER chaperone KAR2/BiP/GRP78 is a classical marker of UPR activation in yeast and mammalian cells (1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). BiP interacts transiently with exposed hydrophobic patches on protein folding intermediates. This is thought to prevent their aggregation while maintaining these proteins in a folding competent state to ensure that only properly folded and assembled proteins exit the ER compartment (7Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). CHOP/GADD153, another UPR marker, is also activated at the transcriptional level. Its maximal induction occurs after several hours and closely parallels the time course of BiP induction (reviewed in Ref. 1Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). In addition, transcription of GADD34 is also enhanced under stress conditions (8Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), and its profile of induction is also very similar to CHOP and BiP. GADD34 is a homologue of the herpes simplex virus-encoded protein γ134.5 (9Chou J. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5247-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which plays an important role in the recovery of the PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser-51 and shutdown of host protein synthesis in virally infected cells. This activity of γ134.5 is dependent on its ability to associate with the catalytic subunit of the protein phosphatase 1c (PP1c) and correlates with an increase in cellular phosphatase activity that dephosphorylates eIF2α (11He B. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20737-20743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12He B. Gross M. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal fragment of GADD34 can substitute for the role of γ134.5 (10He B. Chou J. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 84-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as demonstrated by decreased levels of phosphorylated eIF2α in GADD34-overexpressing cells despite normal activity of the eIF2α kinases PERK and GCN2 (8Novoa I. Zeng H. Harding H.P. Ron D. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1011-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). In parallel, accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER also leads to the inhibition of protein translation. This is due to the activation of the protein kinase PERK, which specifically phosphorylates the α subunit of eIF2 (eIF2α) on Ser-51 (5Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). In order to efficiently initiate protein translation, the trimeric eIF2 complex composed of the α, β, and γ subunits needs to recycle from eIF2-GDP (inactive form) to eIF2-GTP (active form), and this is regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B (13Merrick W.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 291-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated eIF2α has a higher affinity for eIF2B and forms with it a stable complex where the bound GDP cannot be exchanged for GTP (14Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Since eIF2 is normally in excess of eIF2B, phosphorylated eIF2α in the eIF2 complex essentially sequesters the cellular eIF2B activity, and this leads to a general inhibition of translation (14Kimball S.R. Horetsky R.L. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30945-30953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we have shown that the SH2/SH3 domains-containing adaptor molecule Nck-1 modulates protein synthesis at the level of translation through its interaction with the β subunit of eIF2 (eIF2β) (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As eIF2β appears to remain associated to eIF2α and eIF2γ throughout the translation initiation cycle (16Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) and that eIF2α is a major site of regulation of protein translation, we investigated the effect of Nck under ER stress conditions, where translation is normally inhibited through the phosphorylation of eIF2α. Here, we report that overexpression of Nck-1 prevents eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibition of translation in response to ER stress. This appears to depend on the integrity of the second SH3 domain of Nck and relates to a phosphatase-mediated mechanism that could modulate PERK activation. Finally, we demonstrated that protein translation is reduced in Nck-deficient cells and that in these cells translational resistance to ER stress is established by de novo re-expression of Nck-1. Our study not only reveals the importance of Nck for protein translation but also uncovers a novel role for Nck-1 in the regulation of the ER unfolded protein response. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), wild-type, Nck1/Nck2 knockout, and Nck1/Nck2 knockout rescued by re-expression of HA-Nck-1 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Pawson (University of Toronto, Canada) (17Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium high glucose (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Antibodies—Nck and eIF2β antisera were described previously (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). PERK antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-PERK (Thr-980), eIF2α and Ser-51-phosphorylated eIF2α antibodies were purchased, respectively, from Cell Signal Technology and BIOSOURCE International. Western Blotting—Transfected HEK293 cells were treated with 2.5 μg ml-1 tunicamycin, 1 μm thapsigargin, or 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in the lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 17.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg ml-1 aprotinin, and 2 μg ml-1 leupeptin. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 (PERK) or 10% (Nck, eIF2α, and eIF2αP Ser-51) acrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with appropriate primary antibodies, signals were revealed by chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. When MEFs were used, treatment with thapsigargin was performed at 1 μm for 30 min, and then cell lysates were prepared and processed for Western blotting as described for HEK293 cells. Nck-1 Constructs and Transfection—Human Nck-1 constructs described previously (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. For Western blot and RNA analysis, HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm plates and transfected with 10 μg of empty pcDNA3.1MycHis or containing various Myc-Nck-1 molecules. 24 h post-transfection, cells were subjected to the indicated treatment with ER stress agents. To assess translation, HEK293 cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of the luciferase reporter vector described below and either 0.5 μg of empty pcDNA3.1MycHis or encoding various Myc-Nck-1 molecules. When translation was investigated in MEFs, the cells were also plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate a day before being transfected by calcium phosphate with 0.5 μg of the same luciferase reporter vector described below. 24 h post-transfection, transfected MEFs were used for treatment with ER stress agents, and as for HEK293 transfected cells, each treatment condition was analyzed in triplicate. Luciferase Assay—Translational activity in various cell conditions was evaluated as described previously by using the bicistronic reporter plasmid pcDNA3-RLUC-POLIRES-FLUC kindly provided by Dr. N. Sonenberg (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) (19Poulin F. Gingras A.-C. Olsen H. Chevalier S. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected were treated as indicated with 2.5 μg ml-1 tunicamycin (Sigma), 1 μm thapsigargin (Sigma), and/or 5 nm calyculin A (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min or with 10 mm DTT (Calbiochem) for 15 min. MEFs were treated with thapsigargin at 1 μm for 30 min. On clarified cell lysates normalized for protein content, Renilla reniformis luciferase and firefly luciferase activities were measured by using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (LUMAT). Quantitative RNA Analysis—Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with or without 1 μm thapsigargin for 30 min and lysed in Trizol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Quantitative RNA analysis was performed with BiP- and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific oligonucleotides as reported previously. 2D. T. Ngyuen, S. Kebache, S. Jenna, A. Fazel, A. Emaldali, H. N. Wong, J. J. M. Bergeron, R. J. Kaufman, L. Larose, and E. Chevet, submitted for publication. For the luciferase mRNAs levels, Trizol (Invitrogen)-prepared RNAs (5 μg) from HEK293 cells transiently co-transfected with the luciferase reporter vector and Myc-Nck-1 plasmid, and treated with either 2.5 μg ml-1 tunicamycin, 1 μm thapsigargin, or 10 mm DTT were analyzed by semi-quantitative PCR, as described previously (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The amounts of transcribed DNA used for all the above PCRs were in the linear range (data not shown). Ribosomal Profile—Cell lysates from MEFs wild type (WT), Nck double knockout (dKO), or Nck-1-rescued (Nck-1R) either treated or not with thapsigargin were prepared and layered onto a 15-35% linear sucrose gradient as described (21Siomi M.C. Zhang Y. Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, upon treatment, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and buffer A (110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3)) and recovered in buffer B (10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min and disrupted by passages through 25½-gauge needles. At this point, the KCl concentration of the cell extracts was adjusted to 100 mm. Following centrifugation at 1500 × g for 15 min, the resulting supernatant, designated as the cytoplasmic content, was layered on a 15-35% sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 4 °C in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor at 40,000 × g for 2 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient, and the OD of each fraction measured at 254 nm represented the RNA content. Survival Assay—Survival assays were performed as described by others (22Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2350) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were plated in normal media at 12,000 cells/well in 6-well dishes and grown for 16 h before being transiently transfected with either 0.5 μg of empty vector or plasmids encoding Nck-1 molecules. 36 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 0.4 μm thapsigargin (Sigma) in the presence or absence of 20 μg ml-1 cycloheximide (Sigma) for the indicated period of treatment. At the end of treatment, the cells were washed and kept in normal medium. Cells remaining on the plate were stained with crystal violet 5 days later. Overexpression of Nck-1 Prevents ER Stress-induced Inhibition of Protein Translation and Phosphorylation of eIF2α—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a bicistronic luciferase reporter vector and either the empty pcDNA3.1MycHis vector or the same plasmid containing Nck-1 cDNA. 24-36 h post-transfection, transfected cells were treated with the ER stress agents tunicamycin or thapsigargin for 30 min or with DTT for 15 min. In this system, the luciferase activities are markers of translation, and the translation of Rluc is Cap-dependent, whereas translation of the Fluc cistron directed by the poliovirus internal ribosomal entry site is Cap-independent (19Poulin F. Gingras A.-C. Olsen H. Chevalier S. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells transfected with the empty vector, Rluc activity is reduced by 25, 30, and 50% when treated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, or DTT, respectively, compared with similar untreated cells (Fig. 1A). As reported previously (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in cells overexpressing Nck-1, Rluc activity is increased by almost 2-fold. However, Rluc activity in these cells is not reduced by tunicamycin or thapsigargin treatment, and DTT induced only a 30% inhibition (Fig. 1A). Similar effects were observed when Fluc activity was monitored by using the same cell extracts, suggesting that the UPR largely affects initiation of protein translation (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates revealed that in Nck-1-transfected cells, Nck-1 is overexpressed at the levels of endogenous Nck and that the various cell treatments did not alter the levels of endogenous or overexpressed Nck (Fig. 1B). It is well recognized that inhibition of translation under ER stress conditions results from phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51. Our results showing that overexpression of Nck-1 impairs ER stress-induced inhibition of translation prompted us to gauge eIF2α phosphorylation in cells overexpressing Nck-1 upon similar drug treatments. We found phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 increased in mock-transfected cells following thapsigargin and DTT, with the greatest increase upon DTT (Fig. 1B, middle panel). In contrast, in cells overexpressing Nck-1 treated or not with tunicamycin or thapsigargin, phosphorylation of eIF2α remained below the levels detected in untreated mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B, middle panel, and Fig. 1C). Only cells overexpressing Nck-1 treated with DTT showed a clear increase in eIF2α Ser-51 phosphorylation but this level is still lower than the level detected in mock-transfected cells under similar conditions (Fig. 1B, middle panel and Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis for total eIF2α shows, however, comparable levels of endogenous eIF2α in all conditions (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Finally, semi-quantitative PCR performed followed by densitometric analysis of the amplified products and calculation of the ratio Rluc/18S confirmed that treatments with the ER stress pharmacological compounds did not affect luciferase mRNA levels (Fig. 1D and data not shown). This establishes that the variations in luciferase activity measured reflect translational rather than transcriptional changes. Overall, these data demonstrate that under ER stress conditions known to result from the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, overexpression of Nck-1 prevents inhibition of protein translation and eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser-51. Effect of Nck-1 on the Translational Component of the UPR Involves Its Second SH3 Domain—To investigate the mechanism(s) by which Nck antagonizes the translational component of the UPR, we determined the SH domain(s) that Nck-1 requires to prevent the ER stress-induced inhibition of translation. For this purpose, various Myc-tagged Nck-1 mutants deficient in specific SH domain binding abilities were co-transfected with the bicistronic luciferase reporter vector into HEK293 cells. As reported previously (15Kebache S. Zuo D. Chevet E. Larose L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5406-5411Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the effect of Nck-1 on translation in serum-growing conditions is abolished by functional mutation of its first (M1), third (M3), and all SH3 (3M) domains (Fig. 2). In addition, in cells overexpressing these Nck-1 mutants (M1, M3, and 3M), thapsigargin treatment inhibits translation to the same extent as that in mock-transfected cells. As observed for the wild-type Nck-1, overexpression of Nck-1 mutated in its second SH3 domain (M2) enhances protein translation, but upon thapsigargin treatment, in contrast to wild-type Nck, this mutant allows inhibition of translation in response to ER stress conditions (Fig. 2). These results demonstrate that Nck-1 requires the functional integrity of its second SH3 domain to antagonize the translational component of the ER-induced UPR. Nck Is Required for Optimal Protein Translation, but Its Overexpression Antagonizes the UPR to ER Stress Conditions—To further establish a role of Nck in modulating translation and the response of the cells to ER stress, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in which Nck-1 and Nck-2 genes have been inactivated (dKO) (17Bladt F. Aippersbach E. Gelkop S. Strasser G.A. Nash P. Tafuri A. Gertler F.B. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4586-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These MEFs were transfected with the bicistronic luciferase reporter vector, and 36 h post-transfection, luciferase activity was measured following thapsigargin treatment. Compared with MEF controls (WT), Rluc activity is significantly reduced by 20% in dKO MEFs and increased by 1.3-fold in dKO MEFs rescued by the de novo expression of Nck-1 (Nck-1R) (Fig. 3A). Upon thapsigargin treatment, Rluc activity in the MEFs WT and dKO is significantly reduced by 25 and 20%, respectively, compared with reciprocal untreated cells, whereas in dKO MEFs overexpressing Nck-1 (Nck-1R), it remains unchanged (Fig. 3A). Similar data were observed when Fluc activity was monitored (data not shown). Furthermore, reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments have been conducted as described above and ensured that the changes in luciferase activities observed are from changes at the translational level rather than change of transcription (data not shown). Western blot analysis showing the relative expression of Nck in the various MEFs lines revealed that the MEFs Nck-1R cell line expresses Nck-1 at 3.5-4 times more than the MEFS WT (Fig. 3B). In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 1A, the high levels of Nck-1 expression explain why in these cells translation is higher than in WT and why these cells are resistant at the translational level to thapsigargin treatment. In order to further establish the effect of Nck on translation under ER stress conditions by using a different approach than the reporter vector, we performed analysis of ribosomal profiles prepared on sucrose gradient. It is described that agents that cause ER stress result in dissociation of polysomes into monosomes and ribosomal subunits and that this is consistent with attenuation of an early step in mRNA translation (23Prostko C.R. Brostrom M.A. Brostrom C.O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 127: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the ratio of monosomes to polysomes (M:P) to estimate the translational activity of the various previously described MEFs cell lines treated or not with thapsigargin (Fig. 3C and Table I). In the MEFs wild-type (WT), the M:P ratio clearly increased in response to thapsigargin treatment as the OD readout for the 80 S monosomes increased, while the polysomes decreased in this condition. In the cells lacking both Nck isoforms (dKO), the M:P ratio is already higher and increases further upon thapsigargin treatment. This is consistent with the results of Fig. 4A showing that phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 is higher in the dKO than the MEFs WT in the absence of thapsigargin and is much higher in thapsigargin conditions. Finally, in the MEFs dKO where expression of Nck is induced de novo (Nck-1R) but at much higher levels than the endogenous levels found in WT (Fig. 3B), it appears that the relatively low M:P ratio is restored in untreated conditions and that, in contrast to what occurs in MEFs WT, thapsigargin failed to increase this ratio. This is also consistent with the data showing that the Nck-1R MEFs compared with the WT shows essentially no increase in phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 (Fig. 4A). These data from ribosomal profiles not only strongly support our previous observations demonstrating that Nck antagonizes the translational component of the UPR occurring under ER stress conditions, but also that the effect of Nck on this aspect of the UPR correlates with the levels of eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser-51.Table IRatio of monosomes to polysomes calculated from ribosomal profiles prepared from mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing various levels of NckGradient 1Gradient 2MEFs WT (endogenous levels of Nck)Control3.343.57Tg6.677.69MEFs dKO (deleted of both Nck isoforms)Control5.006.67Tg7.6910.00MEFs Nck-1R (expressing Nck-1 at 3.5—4-fold of endogenous Nck)Control4.203.03Tg4.003.13 Open table in a new tab In ER stress conditions induced by the pharmacological agents used in this study, phosphorylation of eIF2α on Ser-51 is primarily attributed to the activation of the ER resident protein kinase PERK. We then assessed the activity of PERK in the MEFs expressing different levels of Nck by using a phosphospecific (Thr-980) PERK antibody, which is recognized to detect only activated forms of PERK. As shown in Fig. 4B, thapsigargin treatment results in an apparently more robust activation of PERK in MEFs depleted of both isoforms of Nck (dKO) compared with WT, whereas PERK appears only weakly activated in MEFs dKO rescued by expression of high levels of Nck-1 (Nck-1R). These observations revealed that under ER stress conditions, PERK activation is influenced by the levels of Nck expression. In addition, our data show a strong correlation between the state of PERK activation and the level of eIF2α phosphorylation on Ser-51. To further characterize the effect of Nck on the UPR resulting in ER stress conditions, we analyzed the induction of BiP in HEK293 cells transfected with either empty vector or a vector encoding Myc Nck-1 and treated or not with thapsigargin. In these conditions where Nck-1 was overexpressed to comparable levels (data not shown) and to assess expression of BiP mRNAs, total RNAs were isolated, and semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR experiments were carried out.

We have previously shown that moesin was not involved in the binding to CD95. Here we further support the specificity of the ezrin/CD95 binding, showing that radixin did not bind CD95. The ezrin region specifically and directly involved in the binding to CD95 was located in the middle lobe of the ezrin FERM domain, between amino acids 149 and 168. In this region, ezrin, radixin, and moesin show 60–65% identity, as compared with the 86% identity in the whole FERM domain. Transfection of two different human cell lines with a green fluorescent protein-tagged ezrin mutated in the CD95-binding epitope, induced a marked inhibition of CD95-mediated apoptosis. In these cells, the mutated ezrin did not co-localize or co-immunoprecipitate with CD95. Further analysis showed that the mutated ezrin, while unable to bind CD95, was fully able to bind actin, thus preventing the actin linkage to CD95. Altogether, our results support the specificity of ezrin in the association to CD95 and the importance of the ezrin-to-CD95 linkage in CD95-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, this study suggests that a major role of ezrin is to connect CD95 to actin, thus allowing the CD95 polarization on the cells and the occurrence of the following multiple cascades of the CD95 pathway.

Particularly, the specific amino acid sequence included in the N-terminal FERM domain of ERM involved in the binding to the various membrane molecules is not yet known. Recently the three-dimensional structure of ezrin FERM domain has been described (31Smith W.J. Cerione R.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The fold consists of three lobes in a trefoil, globally similar to structures reported previously for ERM proteins, with the PIP2 binding domain located on the first and the third lobe (33Hamada K.

Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Previous data, although providing evidence on the biological relevance of CD95/ezrin interaction, lacked information on 1) the specificity of ezrin in the binding to CD95 (i.e. ezrin versus radixin), 2) the epitopes involved in the ezrin binding to CD95, 3) the evidence for a direct interaction between ezrin and CD95, and 4) the in vivo relevance of this direct interaction. In this study, the specificity of ezrin binding and the sites of ezrin/CD95 association were investigated. The results showed that CD95 and ezrin bind directly, as assessed by both two-hybrid assay and GST pull-down experiments, whereas radixin did not co-immunoprecipitate with CD95 and did not bind to CD95. We also report the CD95 binding sites on ezrin FERM domain using deletion series of the ezrin N-terminal domain fused to GST, showing that the ezrin binding site to CD95 is located on the median lobe of ezrin FERM domain. Furthermore, transfection experiments, performed with a GFP-ezrin mutant, obtained substituting the ezrin epitope responsible for the binding to CD95 with the corresponding region of moesin, resulted in the impairment of susceptibility to CD95-mediated apoptosis, consistent with the inability of the mutated ezrin to bind the native CD95.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMammalian Two-hybrid Assay—cDNA fragments for human ezrin and CD95 were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using total RNA extracted from Jurkat cells as template. cDNA for human radixin was obtained from CEM-VBL100 cells as template. The following primers were utilized: CD95185–335, GTCGACCCACTAATTGTTTGGGT and CTGCAGCTAGACCAAGCTTTGG; ezrin1–362, GTCGACACTCACCAGAAACCGA and TCTAGACTCTGCCTTCTTTGTC. Primers for radixin FERM domain were the following: GGATCCAATTCGGCACGAGACA and AAGCTTAGGCTTCCTTCTTCGCAT. PCR products were cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and then CD95 fragment was digested with SalI-PstI and cloned into the SalI and PstI sites of pM GAL4-BD cloning vector (Clontech). Ezrin and radixin PCR products were digested with SalI-XbaI and BamHI-HindIII and cloned into the same sites of pVP16-AD cloning vector (Clontech). The resulting plasmids were designed as pM-CD95, pVP16-ezrin, and pVP16-radixin. pG5CAT was the reporter vector containing the CAT gene downstream of five consensus GAL4 binding sites. Both the cloning vectors and pG5CAT were supplied by the Mammalian MATCHMAKER two-hybrid assay kit (Clontech). The interaction between CD95 and ezrin was assayed by measuring CAT gene expression. As control plasmids, pM53 (vector expressing a fusion of the GAL4 DNA-BD to the mouse protein pM53), pVP16T (vector expressing a fusion of the VP16 AD to the SV40 large T-antigen), pVP16-CP (vector expressing a fusion of the VP 16 AD to a viral coat protein), or pM and pVP16, were utilized. All of the control plasmids were supplied by the kit manufacturer. Plasmids are detailed in Table I. The correctness of the open reading frame was confirmed in all cases by sequencing.Table ICAT expression of the various samples of HeLa transfected cells in the mammalian two-hybrid assay The mammalian two-hybrid assay for the interaction between ezrin or radixin and CD95 was analyzed by measurement of expression of the reporter gene CAT through an ELISA colorimetric analysis.

Cells were transfected with 4 μg of each plasmid by the calcium/phosphate protocol, as previously described (36Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingdom R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Briefly, antibodies to CAT are prebound to the surface of a microtiter plate, and lysates from transfected cells were added to the wells, allowing expressed CAT binding to the anti-CAT-covered plates, and CAT positivity was revealed by a sandwich ELISA. The absorbance of the sample is determined using an ELISA reader.Production and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—A series of deleted N-terminal ezrin fusion proteins were expressed and purified from JM109 bacterial strain (Promega). Ezrin 1–362, ezrin 149–242, ezrin 149–200, ezrin 149–168, and ezrin 508–586 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in pGEX-6P vector (Amersham Biosciences). The following primers were used to direct the synthesis of ezrin truncated forms, adding BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites in frame with and directly apposed, respectively, to the 5′ and 3′ ends of each coding sequence: 1) GGATCCACTCACCAGAAACCGA and 2) GAATTCCTCTGCCTTCTTTGTC (residues 1–362); 3) GGATCCTCTGAGCGGCTGATC and 4) GAATTCCCAAGGAAAGCCAAT (residues 149–242); the third and 5) GAATTCCATTTCCAGGTCCTG (residues 149–200); the third and 6) GAATTCCCACTGGTCCCTGGTA (residues 149–168); 7) GGATCCGAGGACCGGATCCAGG and the fourth (residues 169–242); 8) GGATCCATCCGGGATGACCGCAAT and 9) GAATTCTTACAGGGCCTCGAACTCG (residues 508–586). PCR products were cloned into p-GEM-T (Promega) and then excised with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into pGEX-6P vector (Amersham Biosciences) at the BamHI and EcoRI sites to produce GST-ezrin fragment fusion proteins. Synthesis of GST fusion proteins was induced by incubating transformed bacteria with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested, and the fusion protein was purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), in NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 3 μl/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).Human CD95 cytoplasmic domain was obtained by PCR amplification directed by the primers GGATCCCCACTAATTGTTTGGGT and GAATTCCTAGACCAAGCTTTGG and produced as described for GST-ezrin fusion proteins. The recombinant protein was purified on Sepharose columns (Qiagen) after the cleavage of the GST tag utilizing the PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained protein was about 19 kDa.In Vitro Binding Assay—50 μl of gluthatione-Sepharose beads slurry containing 30 μg of GST-ezrin fusion proteins were separately mixed with 15 μg of purified CD95 death domain in NETN buffer for 16 h at 4 °C or mixed with 1 mg of Jurkat cell total extract in NETN buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Then these preparations were subjected to Western immunoblot assay with anti-CD95 pAb (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GST pAb (Amersham Biosciences), or antiactin mAb (Chemicon) and visualized with peroxidase anti-Ig followed by ECL detection (Pierce).Transfection Assay—The GFP-ezrin/moesin/ezrin (GFP-ez/moe) fusion protein was obtained starting from three separate fragments, ezrin 1–146, moesin 147–173, and ezrin 174–586, and the primers that were used to direct their synthesis were the following: ezrin1–146, CTGCAGACTCACCAGAAACCGA and GGTACCCAGACTTGTGCACTTC; moesin147–173, GGTACCTGGCCGGAGACAAG and GGATCCGCTCCTCCCACTGG; ezrin174–586, GGATCCAGGTGTGGCATGCGG and GAATTCTTACAGGGCCTCGAAC. PCR products were cloned into pTopo vector (Invitrogen) and then excised with the appropriate couple of restriction enzymes (XhoI and KpnI, KpnI and BamHI, and BamHI and EcoRI, respectively) and ligated to acquire a single fragment that subsequently was ligated in the pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech) at the XhoI and EcoRI sites to produce the GFP-ez/moe fusion protein. Primers utilized to produce the full-length ezrin were CTGCAGACTCACCAGAAACCGA and GAATTCTTACAGGGCCTCGAAC, and the GFP-ezrin fusion protein was obtained as described above. Plasmids encoding the GFP-ez/moe or GFP-ezrin fusion proteins were transfected into HeLa cells growing on coverslips using the calcium phosphate protocol (36Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingdom R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates Inc. and John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.1.4-9.1.11Google Scholar), thus obtaining GFP-ez/moe or GFP-ezrin HeLa cells, respectively. Hut78 cells were transfected with the same plasmids using the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection kit (Invitrogen), thus obtaining GFP-ez/moe or GFP-ezrin Hut78 cells. The percentage of transfected cells was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Whole extracts from HeLa, Hut78, Jurkat or CEM-VBL100 cells, and GFP-ezrin and GFP-ez/moe HeLa or Hut78 transfected cells were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, denaturated by boiling, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. CD95, ezrin, radixin, actin, and GFP-tagged proteins were detected with an anti-CD95 pAb (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-ezrin mAb (Transduction Laboratories), an anti-radixin pAb (C15; Santa Cruz), an anti-actin mAb (Chemicon), and anti-GFP tag mAb (clone 1E4; MBL, Japan), and visualized with peroxidase anti-Ig followed by ECL detection (Pierce). CD95, radixin, and ezrin GFP-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of protein A + G-Sepharose beads (protein G plus; Pierce) from precleared cell lysates, respectively, with an anti-CD95 antibody (clone DX2; Calbiochem), an anti-ezrin antibody (clone 3C12; Sigma), an anti-radixin pAb (C15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and GFP mAb (clone 1E4; MBL, Japan). Mouse IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used as control isotype. Immunoprecipitated beads were washed four times in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml supplemented with mixture of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors), resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. Then proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Death Assays—HeLa and Hut78 cells, either untransfected or GFP-transfected, were cultivated in 6-cm plates. Forty-eight hours after transfection, two-color flow cytometric analysis was performed after the following treatments: 1) 24 h after CD95 triggering (500 ng/ml IgM anti-CD95 antibody, clone CH11; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); 2) 6-h TNF-α exposure (50 IU/ml Sigma); or 3) 6 h of staurosporin (STS, 1 μm; Sigma). Untreated cells were considered as control. At the end of treatments, cells were washed and stained by using annexin V-alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). By using this technique, transfected cells showed green fluorescence emission due to GFP, and then they were easily distinguishable from nontransfected cells. Apoptotic cells showed red fluorescence emission due to the annexin V binding. Green/red double positive events thus corresponded to apoptosis of transfected cells. The samples were analyzed with a FACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson) equipped with a 488-nm argon laser. At least 50,000 events have been acquired. Data were recorded and statistically analyzed by a Macintosh computer using CellQuest Software. Statistical analysis of apoptosis data was performed by using Student’s t test. Data reported are the mean of four separate experiments ± S.D. Only p values of less than 0.01 were considered as significant.Confocal Microscopy and Intensified Video Microscopy Analyses—For microscopy analyses, HeLa and Hut78 cells were seeded on coverglass placed in 60-mm Petri dishes. 48 h after transfection with the various GFP plasmids described above, cells were fixed (paraformaldehyde (3%), 30 min, +4 °C) and permeabilized (Triton X-100 (0.5%), 10 min, room temperature). For localization of CD95 and the various GFP-tagged ezrin fusion proteins, samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with polyclonal antibodies to CD95 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with anti-rabbit IgG TRITC conjugate (Sigma). For detection of the naive ezrin on untransfected cells, monoclonal antibody to ezrin (Biogenesis) was used. Then samples were washed in PBS and treated with fluorescent secondary antibody Rhodamine Red (R-6393, goat anti mouse IgG (H+L) Molecular Probes Europe BV, Poort-Gebouw, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were observed and analyzed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV500; Olympus Optical Co. Europe GMBH, Hamburg, Germany) or by intensified video microscopy (IVM) (1Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For IVM analyses, images were captured by a color-chilled 3CCD camera (DELTA Systems), and figures were obtained by adding CD95-TRITC (red) and ezrin (FITC or GFP; green) images through the OPTILAB (Graftek, France) software for image analysis.RESULTSCD95 ERM AssociationWe first performed experiments aimed at investigating a possible direct interaction between CD95 and ERM proteins. Our previous results in human lymphocytes suggested that only ezrin interacted with CD95, whereas moesin was not implicated in the binding to CD95 (1Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, radixin was not expressed in human lymphocytes (1Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 37Ramoni C. Luciani F. Spadaro F. Lugini L. Lozupone F. Fais S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, we preliminarily evaluated the radixin binding to CD95 in cellular systems expressing radixin. To this purpose, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a clone of CEM cells (VBL-100), known to fully express radixin (38Luciani F. Molinari A. Lozupone F. Calcabrini A. Lugini L. Stringaro A. Puddu P. Arancia G. Cianfriglia M. Fais S. Blood. 2002; 99: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, consistently with a previous report (1Parlato S. Giammarioli A.M. Logozzi M. Lozupone F. Matarrese P. Luciani F. Falchi M. Malorni W. Fais S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5123-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), ezrin and CD95 co-immunoprecipitated, whereas radixin was undetectable in CD95 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). Notably, in the same cell extracts, P-glycoprotein (p170) proved to co-immunoprecipitate with radixin (data not shown), further supporting our previous findings (38Luciani F. Molinari A. Lozupone F. Calcabrini A. Lugini L. Stringaro A. Puddu P. Arancia G. Cianfriglia M. Fais S. Blood. 2002; 99: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This first set of results showed that radixin/CD95 interaction did not occur in cells expressing radixin, whereas in the same cells, CD95 interacted with ezrin, further supporting a specific role of ezrin in connecting CD95 to actin.Binding of Ezrin FERM Domain to CD95Two-hybrid Assay—To evaluate a possible direct interaction between ezrin and CD95, two-hybrid assay experiments were performed. The mammalian two-hybrid system was used in order both to allow the occurrence of post-transductional changes, such as tyrosine phosphorylation, and to avoid possible false positive results. By analogy with other ERM-binding membrane proteins, the two-hybrid system was performed using either the ezrin or the radixin FERM domain and the whole CD95 cytoplasmic domain. Particularly, the ezrin N-terminal 392 aa, including the FERM domain and both tyrosine phosphorylation sites (i.e. Tyr145 and Tyr353) (39Jiang W.G. Hiscox S. Singhrao S.K. Puntis M.C. Nakamura T. Mansel R.E. Hallett M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or the whole radixin FERM domain (known to lack Tyr353), were fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain of the pVP16-AD, and the CD95 cytoplasmic domain (aa 185–335) was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain of the pM GAL4-BD cloning vector (Fig. 1, B and C). pG5CAT containing the CAT gene was used as reporter plasmid. Plasmids containing the CD95 and ezrin or radixin fragments and the plasmid containing CAT were transfected in HeLa cells. As control experiments, the interaction of mouse p53 with either"

Depending on the number and sequences of these domains, substrates are phosphorylated by specific subsets of MAPKs. For example, a D domain targets JNK to c-Jun, whereas a DEF motif is required for ERK phosphorylation of c-Fos. JunD, in contrast, contains both D and DEF domains. Here we show that these motifs mediate JunD phosphorylation in response to either ERK or JNK activation. An intact D domain is required for phosphorylation and activation of JunD by both subtypes of MAPK. The DEF motif acts together with the D domain to elicit efficient phosphorylation of JunD in response to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) but has no function on JunD phosphorylation and activation by JNK signaling. Furthermore, we show that conversion of a c-Jun sequence to a canonical DEF domain, as it is present in JunD, elicits c-Jun activation in response to EGF. Our results suggest that evolution of a particular modular system of MAPK targeting sequences has determined a differential response of JunD and c-Jun to ERK activation.

The AP-1 transcription factor activates the transcription of several genes in response to a variety of external stimuli, including growth factors, tumor promoters, and cytokines. Active AP-1 is a dimeric protein complex whose components are the products of the Jun/ATF and Fos/Fra gene families (1Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 107: 129-157Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). The three Jun proteins, c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, share a high degree of sequence homology; however, they display distinct transactivation properties and have different effects on cell proliferation (3Mechta-Grigoriou F. Gerald D. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2378-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Compared with c-Jun, JunD plays an opposite role in cell growth regulation and transformation; whereas c-Jun behaves as a positive regulator of cell growth and may cause cell transformation, JunD antagonizes both of these effects in immortalized fibroblast (4Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 5Weitzman J.B. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol.

However, JunD -/- primary fibroblasts present an increased sensitivity to p53-dependent apoptosis induced by UV or tumor necrosis factor-α (5Weitzman J.B. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that the JNK 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/MEK kinase; MKK7, MAPK kinase 7; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HEK 293, human embryonic kidney 293; HA, hemagglutinin A; wt, wild-type./JunD pathway can collaborate with NF-κB to protect embryonic fibroblasts from tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death (6Lamb A.J. Ventura J.J. Hess P. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1479-1489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). A similar scenario has been also reported for c-Jun; however, the molecular mechanisms through which c-Jun and JunD influence cell-survival seem to be different (7Wisdom R. Johnson S.R. Moore C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 188-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 8Eferi R. Ricci R. Kenner L. Zenz R. David J.P. Rath M. Wagner E.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The N-terminal transactivation domains of c-Jun and JunD are more divergent than other functional domains (9Musti A.M. Treier M. Peverali F.A. Bohmann D. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this difference may account for their diverse biological effects. The N terminus of JunD contains three MAPK phospho-acceptor sites (serine 90, serine 100, and threonine 117), the local sequence contexts of which are essentially identical to those present in the analogous region of c-Jun (serine 63, serine 73, and threonine 91). In the case of c-Jun, it has been well established that phosphorylation of these sites correlates with biological activity (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Jun is predominantly responsive to JNK activation (10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 11Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar); however, in certain cell types serine 63 and serine 73 can be phosphorylated by sustained activation of ERK signaling (12Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1999; 17: 4404-4413Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Conversely the N-terminal domain of JunD is rapidly phosphorylated upon the transient activation of ERK1/2 (13Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, JunD can be phosphorylated in vitro by active JNK and activated by the JNK pathway in vivo (14Yazgan A. Pfarr C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 33: 29710-29718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but less efficiently than c-Jun (15Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 16Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that c-Jun and JunD each display a different extent and kinetics of phosphorylation in response to either the JNK or ERK subtype of MAPK. Accumulating evidence indicates that substrate specificity for MAPKs is determined not only by the sequence in the vicinity of the phospho-acceptor sites but also by distinct targeting domains, also referred to as docking sites, which enhance the efficiency of phosphorylation by mediating the interaction of the kinases with their substrate (17Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Douglas A. Fantz D.J. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27256-27265Google Scholar). The first docking site, here referred to as the D domain, has been identified within the c-Jun δ domain, and it was shown to be required for targeting JNK1/2 to c-Jun (19Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar, 20Kallunki T. Tsigelny S.B. Sluss I. Derijard H.K. Moore B. Davis R.J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Further studies have revealed that analogous D domains exist in other MAPK-responsive transcription factors such as Elk-1 and SAP-1 (21Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 22Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Sharrocks A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 965-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 24Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D.

Chem. 2002; 12: 9896-9903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A second motif, referred to either as the FXF or DEF motif, has been found in certain substrates and shown to function together with the D domain to increase the affinity for ERK and the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation (18Douglas A. Fantz D.J. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27256-27265Google Scholar). However, the DEF domain can function independently from the D domain but requires a sustained signal to specify ERK phosphorylation. This appears to be the case with c-Fos (26Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 8: 556-564Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar). c-Jun and JunD display divergent configurations of the D and DEF domains, the former presenting only a D box whereas the latter contains both an N-terminal D motif and a C-terminal DEF domain (Fig. 1A), suggesting that this difference could account for the distinct responses of the two Jun proteins to ERK signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, Drosophila Jun is a target of the Drosophila ERK type of MAP kinase called Rolled (27Peverali F.A. Isaksson A. Papavassiliou A.G. Plastina P. Staszewski L.M. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and contains both D and DEF putative domains (Fig. 1A). In the present study we have analyzed the role of putative MAPK targeting motifs present in JunD in regulating JunD phosphorylation and transcriptional activity. Also, we have investigated whether the introduction of a canonical DEF motif in c-Jun might rescue c-Jun activation in response to EGF. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Mouse fibroblast cell line NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin-G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK 293 and NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 8 × 105 cells per 100-mm plate and transfected with the indicated plasmids DNA on the following day by LipofectAMINE as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen) Transfected cells were harvested 36-48 h after transfection. Plasmids—All DNA manipulations were performed essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The expression vectors for the JunD-HA, c-Jun-HA, ERK2-MEK1-LA, and MKK7 plasmids have been described (9Musti A.M. Treier M. Peverali F.A. Bohmann D. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar, 30Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for Gal4-cJun was generated by subcloning a DNA fragment corresponding to a Zip-truncated form of human c-Jun (amino acid residues 1-266) into a mammal expression vector in-frame with a ubiquitin promoter-driven Gal4 DNA binding domain (gift of C.Weiss). HA-tagged c-Jun and JunD mutants as well as Gal4/JunD and Gal4-cJun mutants were generated by a PCR-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). Luciferase Assays—Gal4-fused proteins were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid Gal4-luciferase and a Renilla luciferase expression vector, pRL-CMV (Promega), in HEK 293 cells. Transient transfections were performed using the FuGENE-6 reagent as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were incubated for 18-20 h, and then luciferase activity was measured with a Dual luciferase kit (Promega) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the internal transfection control provided by the Renilla luciferase signal. Immunoblotting—Cell extracts from HEK 293 cells were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaF, 1 μm Na3VO4, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Samples were then boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, and the proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and detected by immunoblotting as described previously (9Musti A.M. Treier M. Peverali F.A. Bohmann D. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 619-624PubMed Google Scholar). HA-tagged proteins were detected by using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Phosphorylated JunD-HA and c-Jun-HA were detected by using an anti-phospho-specific c-Jun/JunD antibody (New England Biolabs) that recognizes JunD when it is phosphorylated at serine 100 and c-Jun when is phosphorylated at serine 73. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected by using a mouse monoclonal anti-p-ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-phospho-JNK1/2 was a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). Endogenously expressed ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 kinases were detected respectively by using rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK2 and anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies were used according to the instructions of the manufacturers. Immune complexes were detected by using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). EGF-induced Phosphorylation of JunD Is Mediated by D and DEF Motifs—JunD contains two domains with sequence similarity to the consensus ERK docking sites (R/K)KX4LXL, referred to as the D domain, and FX(F/Y)P, referred to as the DEF motif (Fig. 1A). We have investigated whether the D and DEF domains present in JunD modulate susceptibility to ERK phosphorylation. To this end we have generated HA-tagged JunD mutants in which the LSL hydrophobic motif of the D domain or the FLYP motif were altered, either separately or simultaneously, as indicated in Fig. 1B. We examined the effect of these mutations on JunD phosphorylation in response to the transient activation of ERK signaling elicited by EGF. HA-tagged JunD proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and JunD phosphorylation was monitored by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho-Jun antibody (α-73) that recognizes JunD only if it is phosphorylated at serine 100 (13Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).

In contrast, EGF-induced phosphorylation of JunD was strongly reduced in the JunD-ATA (-/DEF) mutant, which bears a mutated D domain. The JunD-ALY (D/-) mutant, which misses the canonical DEF motif, was partially phosphorylated, whereas phosphorylation was completely abrogated in the JunD-ATA/ALY (-/-) mutant in which both the D and the DEF motifs are missing. These results indicate that the D domain is necessary for ERK-dependent phosphorylation of JunD and that it can direct limited phosphorylation of JunD independently of the DEF motif. In contrast, the DEF motif can only function in the presence of an intact D domain but is required for efficient phosphorylation of JunD in response to EGF. Surprisingly, mutations in the D and DEF motifs of JunD had, respectively, modest or no effect on the capacity of JunD to coimmunoprecipitate ERK (Supplementary Fig. 1A, which can be found in the on-line version of this article). However, we found that c-Jun is also able to interact with ERK (Supplementary Fig. 1, A-D), suggesting that c-Jun/JunD-HA heterodimers may contribute to the coimmunoprecipitation of ERK by the HA antibody and thereby compensate for an otherwise greater effect of JunD mutants. We also investigated the role of the D and DEF domains on in vivo phosphorylation of JunD in response to JNK signaling. HA-tagged JunD-wt or the various Ha-JunD mutants in the D and DEF domains were expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the JNK pathway was induced by anisomycin. To avoid a potential cross-activation of ERK signaling, anisomycin treatments were performed in the presence of the MEK inhibitor U0126. As shown in Fig. 3, phosphorylation of the JunD serine 100 was markedly reduced in the JunD mutant bearing an altered D domain or in the mutant lacking both the D and DEF motifs. In contrast, disruption of the DEF motif did not significantly affect phosphorylation of serine 100, as judged by blotting with phospho-specific antibodies and gel mobility shift. These results indicate that the D domain is sufficient to mediate in vivo phosphorylation of JunD by JNK. Conversely, the DEF motif is not required for JunD phosphorylation by the JNK pathway. Furthermore, analysis of in vivo JunD/JNK interaction, by coimmunoprecipitation experiments, suggests that the effect of a mutated D domain on JunD phosphorylation may be independent from docking JNK (Supplemental Fig. 1, B-D, found in the on-line version of this article). However these results cannot exclude the possibility that JNK/JunD complexes are unstable. Regulation of JunD Biological Activity Requires D and DEF Motifs—Next, we investigated the role of the D and DEF domains on transcriptional activation by JunD in response to EGF. JunD-dependent transcription was evaluated in vivo by expressing a Gal4-JunD/Gal4-luciferase reporter system in HEK 293 cells. The Gal4-JunD fusion protein contains the N-terminal region of JunD fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4 (13Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We have generated mutant forms of a Gal4-JunD protein containing the same point mutations indicated in Fig. 1B. Transcriptional activation following EGF treatment was monitored for each of the mutant proteins as well as for a Gal4-JunD mutant bearing alanine substitutions of serine 90, serine 100, and threonine 117 (Gal4-JunD-Ala). As shown in Fig. 4, EGF treatment led to 4.2-fold induction of Gal4-JunD basal activity but had no effect on the Gal4-JunD-Ala mutant, indicating that the enhancement of JunD transcriptional activity was mediated by the phosphorylation of MAPK sites. Similarly, point mutations only in the D domain or in both the D and DEF domain completely abrogate EGF-dependent induction of GAL4-JunD. Disruption of the DEF motif instead reduced to 1.8-fold the effect of EGF on Gal4-JunD activity. These results correlate very well with the effect of the mutations on ERK-dependent phosphorylation of JunD (Fig. 2B) and demonstrate that the D domain is necessary and sufficient for enhancing JunD activity in response to EGF; however, an intact DEF domain is required for maximal JunD activation. We have shown previously that co-expression of a constitutively active form of ERK2, the kinase fusion protein ERK2-MEK1-LA (31Robinson M.J. Stippec S.A. Goldsmith E. White M.A. Cobb M.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1141-1150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increases the basal activity of Gal4-JunD but has no effect on Gal4-JunD-Ala (13Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined transcriptional activation of the various Gal4-JunD mutants in response to co-expression of ERK2-MEK1-LA. As expected, ERK2-MEK1-LA increased the basal activity of Gal4-JunD 3-fold but had no effect on GAL4-JunD-Ala. Like EGF treatments, ERK2-MEK1-LA expression had no effect on Gal4-JunD (-/D) or Gal4-JunD (-/-) (Fig. 4A). Conversely, disruption of the DEF domain had only a modest effect on Gal4-JunD activity induced by ERK2-MEK1-LA, suggesting that the DEF motif is less crucial in presence of sustained ERK activation. A Canonical DEF Domain Leads to c-Jun Activation in Response to EGF—The results shown in Figs. 2 and 4A indicate that the D domain and the DEF motif of JunD function additively to mediate rapid phosphorylation and activation of JunD in response to EGF in an ERK-dependent manner. Conversely, c-Jun phosphorylation and transcriptional activity are not responsive to transient activation of ERK signaling (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 3Mechta-Grigoriou F. Gerald D. Yaniv M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2378-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A comparison of JunD and c-Jun sequences flanking the MAPK sites shows that c-Jun differs from JunD in the region where the latter contains the DEF motif (Fig. 1A). The FLYP sequence present in JunD contains the consensus phenylalanine and tyrosine residues in positions 1 and 3. The corresponding FLCP sequence present in c-Jun lacks the consensus phenylalanine/tyrosine residue in position 3, which has been shown to be crucial for specifying ERK phosphorylation of either ETS proteins or c-Fos (18Douglas A. Fantz D.J. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27256-27265Google Scholar, 26Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 8: 556-564Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to explore whether this divergence could account for the differential activation of c-Jun and JunD proteins in response to ERK signaling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the activity of a Gal4-cJun fusion protein compared with a mutant form, named Gal4-cJun/DEF, where the FLCP sequence of c-Jun was converted to FLYP, as it is in the DEF motif of JunD (Fig. 5A). We also generated a Gal4-cJun/DEF-Ala mutant where the FLYP mutation was inserted into a Gal4-cJun protein bearing the four MAPK phospho-acceptor sites mutated to alanine residues (Fig. 5A). The various Gal4-cJun proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells together with a Gal4-luciferase reporter system, and their relative activities in response to EGF were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 5B, EGF treatments had no effect on the basal activity of Gal4-cJun-wt or Gal4-cJun/DEF-Ala but induced the activity of Gal4-cJun/DEF 3.9-fold, indicating that the insertion of a canonical DEF domain makes c-Jun responsive to EGF in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. To exclude the possibility that the inducibility of the Gal4-cJun-wt protein was constitutively impaired, we evaluated Gal4-cJun activity in response to JNK signaling by co-expressing the MKK7 stress kinase (30Tournier C. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 14: 7337-7342Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of MKK7 induced the activity of Gal4-cJun-wt 3.7-fold (Fig. 5B). However, MKK7 had a limited effect on Gal4-cJun/DEF activity, suggesting that conversion of the FLCP motif in the FLYP/DEF domain had a negative effect on c-Jun activation by JNK. Next we evaluated the phosphorylation status of the c-Jun or c-Jun/DEF protein in response to transient activation of ERK signaling. HA-tagged c-Jun-wt, c-Jun/DEF, or JunD proteins were expressed in NIH-3T3, and the phosphorylation of each in response to serum stimulation was monitored by using an anti-phospho-Jun antibody (α-73) that recognizes either c-Jun or JunD only if they are phosphorylated at serine 73 or serine 100, respectively. As expected, phosphorylation of JunD was rapidly induced in response to serum stimulation (Fig. 5C). In contrast, neither 10 nor 30 min of serum stimulation had an effect on the level of c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 5C). However, phosphorylation of the c-Jun/DEF mutant was clearly induced after 10 min of the stimulus. Together with the results shown in Fig. 5B, these findings demonstrate that introduction of the DEF motif enables c-Jun to be responsive to transient activation ERK signaling. Extracellular stimuli regulate AP-1 activity by activating MAPK cascades that mediate phosphorylation of distinct substrates (2Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar, 10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Depending on the duration of intracellular signaling, serum and growth factor have been shown to induce AP-1 by distinct mechanisms. Transient activation of ERK, as elicited by EGF, leads to phosphorylation of transcription factors of the ternary complex factor (TCF) family such as Elk-1 and, thus, causes induction of the c-fos gene (10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that AP-1 regulation by ERK signaling may also occur at the level of ERK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of JunD (13Gallo A. Cuozzo C. Esposito I. Maggiolini M. Bonofiglio D. Vivacqua A. Garramone M. Weiss C. Bohmann D. Musti A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6434-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ERK-dependent activation of JunD in response to EGF is mediated by MAPK targeting motifs present in the N-terminal region of JunD. The effect of the MEK-specific inhibitor UO126 (Fig. 1A) on JunD phosphorylation indicates that the EGF-induced phosphorylation of JunD is mediated by ERK activation. Furthermore, the time course of JunD phosphorylation in response to EGF reflects the activation kinetics of ERK rather than of JNK as shown by the analysis of the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 (Fig. 2A) The functional link between EGF-induced phosphorylation and JunD activation is supported by the observation that JunD-dependent transcription was induced by EGF only if the three MAPK phospho-acceptor sites, present in the transactivation domain, were intact (Fig. 3A). Physiological substrates of ERK have been shown to contain docking motifs, referred to as the D domain and the DEF motif, that, depending on their number and position, regulate the affinity for ERK (17Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Douglas A. Fantz D.J. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27256-27265Google Scholar). ERK target proteins containing both motifs, such as Elk-1 and SAP-1, have been shown to have higher affinity for ERK than other substrates containing only a DEF or a D motif, such as KRS proteins (22Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R329-R331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We noted that JunD contains both the D domain and the DEF motif flanking the MAPK phospho-acceptor sites in a configuration that is reminiscent of the structures of Elk-1 and SAP-1 (Fig. 1A). Primary sequence requirements for MAPK docking sites have been determined for both the D and the DEF motifs (17Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Douglas A. Fantz D.J. Glossip D. Kornfeld K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 29: 27256-27265Google Scholar). Analysis of JunD mutants bearing alanine substitution of these sequences has allowed us to determine that the D domain mediates JunD phosphorylation by both ERK and JNK (Figs. 2B and 3). Although the D domain was sufficient to induce JunD activation by JNK signaling (Figs. 3 and 4B), both the D and DEF motifs were required for efficient phosphorylation and activation of JunD in response to transient activation of ERK, as elicited by EGF stimulation (Fig. 2B and 4A). On the other hand, the DEF domain seems not to be crucial for JunD activation by sustained activation of ERK signaling (Fig. 4A). These observations suggest that the D domain is sufficient to specify both JNK and ERK phosphorylation; however, the simultaneous presence of the D and DEF motifs, by increasing JunD affinity for ERK, allows JunD to be activated in response to EGF. Consistent with this conclusion, c-Fos and c-Jun, containing, respectively, the DEF or the D domain (Fig. 1A), are phosphorylated by extracellular stimuli that cause sustained activation of ERK signaling (12Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1999; 17: 4404-4413Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 26Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 8: 556-564Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar), but not in response to EGF (10Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 12Leppa S. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1999; 17: 4404-4413Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In addition, conversion of the FLCP sequence of c-Jun into the consensus FLYP/DEF motif turned c-Jun into an EGF-responsive transcription factor (Fig. 5). Two lines of evidence indicate that introduction of a DEF motif increased ERK phosphorylation of c-Jun. First, the DEF domain could rescue c-Jun-dependent transcription only if the MAPK sites were intact (Fig. 5B). Second, introduction of the DEF domain elicited c-Jun phosphorylation by transient activation of ERK signaling. Depending on the cell type, transient or sustained activation of the MEK-ERK pathway has been associated with specific biological outcomes, such as S-phase entry, differentiation, or cell survival (26Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 8: 556-564Crossref Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 34Marshall C.J.

Our results indicate that evolution of a distinct configuration of ERK targeting sites has differentiated c-Jun and JunD in their capacity to sense the duration of ERK-signaling (Fig. 6). According to this model, Drosophila Jun, a target of both JNK/Basket and ERK/Rolled pathways (27Peverali F.A. Isaksson A. Papavassiliou A.G. Plastina P. Staszewski L.M. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Kockel L Zeitlinger J. Staszewski L.M. Mlodzik M. Bohmann D. Genes Dev. 1997; 13: 1748-1758Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), contains putative D and DEF motifs (Fig. 1A). In conclusion, our study suggests that quantitative differences of ERK activation are translated into the qualitative differences of c-Jun and JunD activation. In turn, a differential regulation by ERK signaling may account for the distinct modality through which c-Jun and JunD affect cell proliferation and survival. We thank. R.J.

However, the nature and the biological relevance of these homodimers have not yet been investigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells and CD40-transfected HEK 293 cells constitutively expressed disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 homodimers at low levels. Oligomerization of CD40 leads to a rapid and significant increase in the disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 homodimer formation, a response that could be prevented using a thiol-alkylating agent. Formation of CD40/CD40 homodimers was found to be absolutely required for CD40-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which, in turn regulated B7.2 expression. In contrast, CD40 monomers provided the minimal signal emerging from CD40, activating p38 MAP kinase and inducing homotypic B cell adhesion. CD40/CD40 homodimer formation was totally independent of TRAF1/2/3/5 associations with the threonine at position 254 in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD40 molecules.

This finding may be vital to better understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern cell signaling triggered by CD40/CD154 interactions. The CD40 molecule is a 45-50-kDa type I phosphorylated glycoprotein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily and was initially considered to be a growth factor receptor on B cells (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of CD40 with its natural ligand, CD154, is a crucial step in T cell-dependent B cell activation and differentiation as demonstrated in patients suffering from the X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (2DiSanto J.P.

The cellular events triggered in CD40-positive cells following CD40/CD154 interactions are not restricted to B cells only but can also be triggered in dendritic cells, monocytes, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CD40 ligation mediates a broad variety of immune and inflammatory responses (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar). Abnormal CD40 signaling seems to be directly associated with the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases (19Mauri C. Mars L.T. Londei M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), neurodegenerative disorders (20Town T. Tan J. Mullan M. Neurochem. Int. 2001; 39: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), graft-versus-host diseases (21Tamada K. Tamura H. Flies D. Fu Y.X. Celis E. Pease L.R. Blazar B.R. Chen L. J. Clin.

Consequently, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern CD40-mediated signal transduction is critical not only in explaining how CD40 exerts its multifunctional outcome but also in developing new therapeutic agents and strategies leading to blockage of specific CD40-induced responses. Although it is well established that fully active CD154 is mainly present in a trimeric form at the cell surface and/or following release from the cell membrane (1Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18van Kooten C. Banchereau J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 2-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), little research has been conducted on the possible existence of CD40/CD40 homodimers and their role in immune responses. It was originally reported in 1989 that bladder carcinoma cell lines and human B cell lines constitutively express low levels of CD40/CD40 homodimers (24Braesch-Andersen S. Paulie S. Koho H. Nika H. Aspenstrom P. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 562-567PubMed Google Scholar). Since this discovery, there has only been one report demonstrating that CD40/CD40 homodimers are formed as a consequence of B cell activation (25Baker M.P. Eliopoulos A.G. Young L.S. Armitage R.J. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2830-2843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a functional link between these homodimers and the downstream signaling events affecting key B cell functions has not yet been elucidated. Here, we report that, although low levels of disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 homodimers were present on EBV-positive and CD40-transfected cells, they rapidly increased after CD40 oligomerization. Whereas engagement of CD40 monomers generated the minimal signal required to activate the MAP kinase p38 and induce homotypic B cell adhesion, the formation of CD40/CD40 homodimers was required for CD40-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase and the subsequent up-regulation of B7.2 expression. CD40/CD40 homodimer formation did not depend on TRAF1/2/3/5 association with the threonine at position 254 of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail. These findings suggest that disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 homodimers play a pivotal role in CD40-induced responses Antibodies, Chemicals, and Reagents—The hybridomas producing the mouse mAbs directed against human CD40 (G28-5; IgG1) and human CD154 (5C8; IgG2a) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The monoclonal anti-B7.2 (Bu86; IgG1) Ab was kindly provided by Dr. Michel Tremblay (Infectiology Unit Research, Laval University, Québec, Canada). The irrelevant IgG1 and IgG2a isotype controls were produced in our laboratory. Polyclonal rabbit anti-CD40, goat anti-mouse IgG, anti-p38, anti-AKT, and their anti-phosphorylated counterparts as well as the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Trimeric CD154 was a generous gift from Immunex Corp, Seattle, WA (26Morris A.E. Remmele Jr., R.L. Klinke R. Macduff B.M. Fanslow W.C. Armitage R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 418-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cell culture agents and electrophoresis grade chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The MAP kinase p38 inhibitor SB203580 and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were from Calbiochem. Plasmid Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The CD40-T254A mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® XL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Wild-type CD40 and mutant CD40-T254A constructs were subcloned into the pCEP4 expression vector (Clontech). The mutation T254A was confirmed by the entire sequencing of the inserts. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—All B cell lines, mouse LTK- fibroblast cells, and HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Human tonsillar B cells were isolated as described previously (27al-Daccak R. Damaj B. Naccache P.H. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mouse fibroblast LTK- cells were stably transfected with a gene encoding for the wild-type form of the human CD154 protein, as described previously (28Etongue-Mayer P. Langlois M.A. Ouellette M. Li H. Younes S. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were cultured at 75% confluency in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with the expression vectors pCEP4 (mock-transfected cells), pCEP4 wild-type CD40, and pCEP4 CD40-T254A using the Clontech calcium phosphate precipitation kit. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using the anti-CD40 mAb G28-5 was performed 24 h post-transfection (29Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Induction of CD40/CD40 Homodimers—B cells and HEK 293 transfectants were diluted to 107 cells/ml and 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, respectively. G28-5 was added in the culture media to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated on ice for 15 min. Washed cells were then resuspended with 5 μg/ml anti-mouse IgG and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, B cells were stimulated with trimeric, soluble CD154 (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. For co-incubation with mouse fibroblasts, 7.5 × 105 LTK--untransfected (m-CD154-) and LTK--CD154-transfected cells (m-CD154+) were left to adhere for at least 24 h before adding 3 × 106 serum-deprived (3 h) B cells. B cells were gently collected using ice-cold Hanks' buffer after a 30-min coincubation period at 37 °C. Western Blot Analysis—To detect CD40 molecules, cells were lysed in ice-cold TNE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm Na3VO4, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. Anti-CD40 mAb G28-5 was used as a probe when cell lysates were diluted in nonreducing SDS-PAGE buffer containing 2% SDS and 10% glycerol. On the other hand, polyclonal anti-CD40 Ab was used when samples were treated with DTT, a sulfhydryl-reducing agent, or iodoacetamide (IA), a thiol-alkylating agent. In both conditions, samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, CD40 molecules were probed with G28-5 (1:3000) or rabbit anti-CD40 Ab (1:2000) for at least 2 h at 37 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG Ab (1:20 000) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell signaling on CD40-stimulated cells was performed in reducing conditions by adding 2% 2-mercaptoethanol to the sample buffer. Anti-p38 (1:1000), anti-phospho-p38 (1:750), anti-AKT (1:1000), and anti-phospho-AKT (1:750) phosphorylated Abs were diluted in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Blots were probed for at least 3 h at 37 °C and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab (1:10 000) for 1 h at 37 °C. Probed molecules were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Isolation of mRNA and Northern Blot Analysis—After stimulation, B cells were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The homogenates were extracted with chloroform, and total RNA was precipitated with 80% isopropanol. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was fractionated in 1.2% agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with 32P-labeled human B7.2 followed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Cell-Cell Adhesion—CD40-induced homotypic adhesion of human B cells (BJAB) was monitored in co-culture and anti-CD40 mAb systems. In the co-culture system, 4 × 105 B cells were co-incubated with 1 × 105 LTK--untransfected (m-CD154-) or LTK- CD154-transfected (m-CD154+) cells seeded previously in 24-well plates. In the mAb system, 2 × 105 B cells were seeded in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml G28-5. Cell-cell adhesion was assessed by phase-contrast microscopy at the times indicated in the Fig. 5 legend. CD40 Engagement Rapidly Induces CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation on Human B Cells—Studies on CD40/CD154 interactions demonstrated that various degrees of CD40 cross-linking result in different cellular responses (30Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), an outcome that could be attributed to the ability of CD154 to trigger the formation of CD40 trimers and/or oligomers of different extents. We first investigated the possible existence of CD40 trimers or oligomers in different human B cell lines and in resting B cells. For this purpose, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot under non-reducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, all inactivated B cell lines expressed the typical 43- and 48-kDa CD40 protein profiles, whereas EBV-positive LG2 B cells also expressed low levels of an 85-90 kDa protein band, a molecular mass range that corresponds to the expected molecular mass range of CD40/CD40 homodimers (24Braesch-Andersen S. Paulie S. Koho H. Nika H. Aspenstrom P. Perlmann P. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 562-567PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a significant increase in CD40/CD40 homodimers on LG2 B cells was induced after 30 min of stimulation with m-CD154 (in the co-culture system), and soluble CD154 (s-CD154). The formation of CD40 dimers was slightly enhanced when B cells were stimulated for 15 min with a bivalent anti-CD40 mAb alone, whereas CD40 dimerization was induced at similar levels to that of CD154 when anti-CD40 mAbs were cross-linked by secondary Abs (Fig. 1, A and B). CD40/CD40 homodimer formation was not restricted to EBV-positive B cells alone, because CD40 dimerization was also rapidly induced in EBV-negative BJAB, Ramos, and human tonsillar B cells (Fig. 1B). In all cases, the formation of CD40/CD40 homodimers was mirrored by a decrease in the pool of CD40 monomers. The absence of CD40 complexes with molecular masses equal to or greater than 120-150 kDa, even after a long exposure of the autoradiogram (data not shown), indicated that oligomerization of CD40 induces the formation of only stable CD40/CD40 homodimers. CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation Is Mediated by a Disulfide Bond and Completely Prevented by Alkylation of Free Sulfhydryl Groups—Receptor homodimerization is not unique for CD40, as it has been observed in the case of type II tumor necrosis factor receptors (31Grazioli L. Casero D. Restivo A. Cozzi E. Marcucci F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22304-22309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the homodimer is mediated by disulfide bond formation and pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, which alkylates free sulfhydryl groups, inhibits dimer formation of these receptors on live human erythroleukemia K562 cells (31Grazioli L. Casero D. Restivo A. Cozzi E. Marcucci F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22304-22309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations and those reported in Fig. 1 showing that CD40/CD40 homodimers are very detergent-(2-3% SDS) and heat-stable (100 °C for 5 min), we hypothesize that homodimer formation is mediated by disulfide bonds in living B cells. To confirm our hypothesis, two complementary approaches were used. In the first approach, B cells were pretreated with 1 mm IA or 1 mm DTT, a well known disulfide-reducing agent, for 5 min at 37 °C before stimulation. Cells were washed extensively and stimulated with membrane-bound CD154. Cell lysates were analyzed under non-reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-CD40 polyclonal antibody. Fig. 2A shows a representative result for all B cells tested. The formation of CD40/CD40 homodimers was prevented when the cells were pretreated with the irreversible thiol-alkylating agent IA but not when they were pretreated with DTT. In the second approach, once CD40/CD40 homodimerization had been induced, cell lysates were heat-treated in the presence of 1 mm DTT or 1 mm IA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. Fig. 2B shows that treatment of cell lysates with DTT completely disrupted constitutive as well as induced CD40/CD40 homodimerization. In contrast, CD40/CD40 homodimers were detected at approximately the same levels regardless of whether or not the thiol-alkylating agent IA was added to the samples. Similar results were obtained with cells (BJAB, Ramos, and LG2 B) stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD40 mAbs (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that CD40/CD40 homodimerization was mediated by disulfide bond formation and that alkylation of free sulfhydryl groups completely inhibited homodimer formation. CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation Is Required for CD40-induced Phosphatidylinositol-3 Kinase Activation in Human BJAB B Cells—Based on the above results and recent observations that different degrees of CD40 cross-linking result in different cellular responses (30Fanslow W.C. Srinivasan S. Paxton R. Gibson M.G. Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 32Pound J.D. Challa A. Holder M.J. Armitage R.J. Dower S.K. Fanslow W.C. Kikutani H. Paulie S. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that the engagement of CD40/CD40 homodimers could be involved in the activation of at least one classic CD40-induced signaling pathway. BJAB B cells were left untreated or pretreated with 1 mm IA and then activated in the co-culture system. Protein samples from control and IA-pretreated cell lysates were Western blotted and probed with polyclonal Abs directed against the activated, phosphorylated form of AKT, a specific PI 3-kinase substrate, and p38. Our results showed that, in control BJAB B cells, CD40/CD40 homodimer formation (Fig. 2) was correlated with PI 3-kinase and p38 activation (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in conditions in which IA pretreatment inhibited CD40/CD40 homodimer formation, only the PI 3-kinase pathway was completely abolished, as shown by the almost total lack of phosphorylation of AKT and the slightly increased phosphorylation of p38 in IA-pretreated B cells (Fig. 3A). The specificity of IA treatment with regard to CD40/CD40-induced responses was determined by analyzing the effect of IA on oxidative stress stimulation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), an agent that is known to induce a similar response in BJAB B cells (33Ding J. Takano T. Gao S. Han W. Noda C. Yanagi S. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30873-30877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with IA, washed, and stimulated with 1 μm H2O2 for 10 min at 37 °C. Our results (Fig. 3B) demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide-induced activation of PI 3-kinase and p38 was unaffected by IA pretreatment, confirming the specificity of the IA treatment with regard to CD40/CD40-induced responses. CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation Is an Absolute Requirement for B7.2 Expression—To further explore the biological outcomes of CD40/CD40 homodimer engagement, we analyzed the transcription of B7.2, a strong T-cell co-stimulatory molecule regulated following CD40 ligation on B cells (34Evans D.E. Munks M.W. Purkerson J.M. Parker D.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Haswell L.E. Glennie M.J. Al-Shamkhani A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3094-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that CD40 ligation by m-CD154 enhanced B7.2 transcription on BJAB B cells after a 2-h co-incubation period (Fig. 4A) and B7.2 protein expression at the cell surface after 24 h of co-incubation (Fig. 4B). Pretreatment of BJAB B cells with IA completely inhibited CD40-mediated up-regulation of B7.2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, strongly suggesting that the CD40/CD40 homodimer formation is an absolute requirement for B7.2 expression. PI 3-kinase Activation Is Required for CD40-mediated Upregulation of B7.2—To confirm the direct involvement of the CD40/CD40 homodimer in PI 3-kinase activation and the consequent regulation of B7.2, BJAB B cells were pretreated for 30 min with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 before stimulation with m-CD154. LY294002, at a final concentration of 30 μm, completely inhibited AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 5A) without affecting the activation of other signaling pathways, such as p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (data not shown), and prevented the transcription of B7.2 mRNA (Fig. 5A). The activation of PI 3-kinase and the expression of B7.2 were unaffected following m-CD154 stimulation of BJAB B cells incubated in the presence of 10 μm SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 phosphorylation (data not shown). To further support the role of CD40/CD40 homodimers in CD40-induced, PI 3-kinase-dependant expression of B7.2, BJAB B cells were stimulated with G28-5 alone or G28-5 followed by a secondary cross-linker Ab. As shown in Fig. 5B, stimulation with G28-5 slightly increased the activation of PI 3-kinase after a 15-min period of stimulation. In the same experiment, BJAB B cells were stimulated with G28-5 for 5 min, washed, and incubated in the presence of secondary Abs for 10 min. Under these conditions, PI 3-kinase activation was enhanced at level similar to that with m-CD154 (Fig 5, A versus B) and, as shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of CD40 dimers were significantly increased in BJAB B cells (data not shown). On the other hand, the expression of B7.2 mRNA was induced when G28-5 was cross-linked, but not in the presence of G28-5 alone (Fig. 5B). On the basis of these results, we concluded that CD40-mediated activation of PI 3-kinase and the subsequent up-regulation of B7.2 mRNA expression are critically dependent on CD40/CD40 dimer formation. CD40-induced Homotypic B cell Adhesion Was Totally Independent of CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation—Engagement of CD40 molecules induces B cells to proliferate, differentiate, and form homotypic cellular aggregates. Cell-cell adhesion events play critical roles in the sequential migrations and multiple specific cell-cell interactions that B cells undergo during normal development and function. A recent study demonstrated that the interference of CD40 signaling in spontaneous or B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-mediated apoptosis of human B cells requires minimal cross-linking, whereas promoting homotypic cell-cell adhesion and proliferation requires intermediate and high levels of CD40 oligomerization, respectively (32Pound J.D. Challa A. Holder M.J. Armitage R.J. Dower S.K. Fanslow W.C. Kikutani H. Paulie S. Gregory C.D. Gordon J. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because strong B cell adhesion can be generated using bivalent anti-CD40 mAbs, such as G28-5, and given that this mAb does not induce high levels of CD40/CD40 homodimerization (Figs. 1 and 2), we hypothesized that activation via noncovalent ligation of CD40 monomers would provide the minimal signal to induce homotypic cell-cell adhesion. Strong cell-cell adhesion of BJAB B cells was induced after a 6-h incubation period in the co-culture system (Fig. 6A), a cell response that was inhibited in the presence of anti-CD154 5C8 Abs (data not shown). The formation of these cellular aggregates was unaffected by IA-pretreatment (1 mm) of BJAB B cells (Fig. 6A). These results were confirmed using IA-pretreated BJAB B cells stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb G28-5 (1 μg/ml). Strong cellular aggregates at levels similar to untreated cells were observed after a 3-h stimulation period (Fig. 6B). Taking together, these results indicate that B cell homotypic adhesion in response to CD40 ligation is totally independent of disulfide-linked CD40/CD40 homodimer formation. CD40/CD40 Homodimer Formation Was Totally Independent of TRAF1/2/3/5 Association with Cytoplasmic Threonine 254 of CD40 Molecules—CD40 multimerization during cell signaling seems to be a critical event in TRAF recruitment (36Pullen S.S. Dang T.T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14246-14254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 37Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Indeed, the threonine 254 residue mainly mediated CD40-induced signaling and CD40-association with different TRAF members, in particular TRAF1/2/3 and 5 (11Grammer A.C. Lipsky P.E. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 76: 61-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of this residue in CD40/CD40 dimer formation, HEK 293 cells expressing CD40 wild-type or CD40 mutated at residue T254 (CD40-T254A) were used. Cells were stimulated with G28-5 alone or G28-5 cross-linked with a secondary Ab and then analyzed for CD40/CD40 homodimer formation as above. Our results (Fig. 7) clearly demonstrate that CD40/CD40 homodimer formation was induced at similar levels on cells expressing the CD40 wild-type and the T254A mutant. This indicated that CD40/CD40 homodimer formation did not depend on a CD40-TRAF association, at least for TRAF1/2/3 and 5, which interact with the cytoplasmic threonine at position 254 in the CD40 molecule. Similarly to other ligand/receptor interactions, the binding of various members of the tumor necrosis factor family to their receptors triggers dimerization or even oligomerization of the relevant receptors (37Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Sco"

Here, we present the characterization of Hrb1, a novel component of the transported ribonucleoprotein complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The protein is similar to the other two serine/arginine (SR)-type proteins in yeast, Gbp2 and Npl3. Hrb1 is nuclear at steady state and its import is mediated by the karyopherin Mtr10. Hrb1 binds to poly(A)+ RNA in vivo and its binding is significantly increased in MTR10 mutants, suggesting a role for Mtr10 in dissociating Hrb1 from the mRNAs. Interestingly, by comparing the export requirements of all three SR proteins we find similarities but also striking differences. While the export of all three proteins is dependent on the export of mRNAs in general, as no transport is observed in mutants defective in transcription (rpb1-1) or mRNA export (mex67-5), we find specific requirements for components of the THO complex, involved in transcription elongation. While both Hrb1 and Gbp2 depend on Mft1 and Hpr1 for their nuclear export, Npl3 is exported independently of both proteins. These findings suggest that Hrb1 and Gbp2, but not Npl3, might be loaded onto the growing mRNA via the THO complex components Mtf1 and Hrp1.

The cellular separation of transcription and translation in eukaryotic cells, requires transport across the nuclear envelope from one compartment into the other. Although significant progress has been made in understanding nuclear transport, unraveling the export mechanisms for mRNAs remains to be a challenge. General transport requires transport receptors of the importin family, also termed karyopherins and the Ran GTPase cycle (1Barry D.M. Wente S.R.

Mex67 is recruited to the mRNA by Yra1, a component of the transcription and export complex that couples transcription with export. Transcription and export is composed of Yra1 and Sub2 and the heterotetrameric THO complex (consisting of Mft1, Hpr1, Thp2, and Tho2), which functions in transcription elongation (10Piruat J.I.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both proteins comprise a serine/arginine-rich region (SR domain), which is the target of the SR-specific protein kinase Sky1 (SRPK1 and SRPK2 in mammalia) (19Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, the SR domain of both RNA-binding proteins is important for the nuclear re-import mediated by the import receptor Mtr10 (transportin SR (TRN-SR1 and TRN-SR2) in mammalia) (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E.

Furthermore, the cap binding complex, the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CF IB) Hrp1, a DEAD-box helicase Dbp5/Rat8 (DBP5 in metazoans), and the poly(A)-binding protein Pab1 (PABP1 in metazoans) have been shown to be part of the exported mRNP (22Visa N.

Here, we present data that characterize Hrb1 as a shuttling mRNA-binding protein that accompanies mRNAs to the cytoplasm and can therefore be added to the list of proteins that comprise the exported mRNP. Hrb1 is highly homologues to the SR-type shuttling mRNA-binding proteins Gbp2 and Npl3. Interestingly, although the import requirements of all three proteins are very similar, we find striking differences in their export requirements. While both Hrb1 and Gbp2 are dependent on Mft1 and Hpr1, two components of the THO complex, the export of Npl3 is independent of both components, suggesting differences in the recruitment of the SR proteins to the mRNAs. Plasmid Constructs and Yeast Strains—The plasmids expressing NLS-GFP (pHK511), HRB1-GFP from the GAL1 promoter (pHK235), MTR10 (pHK414), and GBP2-GFP from the GAL1 promoter (pHK367) were described previously (18Windgassen M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All other plasmids were created by PCR with specific primers, subcloned in different vectors, and verified by sequencing. The complete open reading frame of HRB1 and 500 bp upstream (HRB1 promoter) was cloned into pHK12 (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a CEN plasmid with a URA3 marker, resulting in pHK537. The open reading frame of NPL3 was subcloned into pHK230 resulting in GAL1-GFP-NPL3 (pHK144). The yeast strains wild type (HKY36), mtr10-7 (HKY270), sky1::TRP1 (pHK267), rpb1-1 (HKY77), hmt1::HIS3 (HKY53), thp2::KAN (HKY325), mft1::KAN (HKY329), and hpr1::HIS3 (HKY327) were described previously (10Piruat J.I.

Expression and GFP Localization—All procedures were essentially carried out as described previously (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For fluorescent microscopy, strains were grown to the logarithmic growth phase (1 × 107 cells/ml) at 25 °C in appropriate media and then shifted to 37 °C for the indicated times. The GFP signal was analyzed directly in fluorescent microcopy and pictures were taken from fixed cells. For this purpose 5 ml of the cultures were mixed with 350 μl of 37% formaldehyde. Cells were immediately collected by centrifugation and washed once in 0.1 m K2HPO4-KH2PO4 at pH 6.5 and once in P solution (0.1 m K2HPO4-KH2PO4 at pH 6.5, 1.2 m sorbitol). For experiments with the GAL1 HRB1-GFP plasmid, strains were grown to the early log phase (5 × 106 cells/ml) in raffinose containing medium. The induction of the fusion protein was induced by addition of galactose and further incubation for 2 h. In this time the strains grew to ≈1 × 107 cells/ml and were than treated as described above. UV Cross-linking of Hrb1 to Poly(A)+RNA—Isolation of UV-cross-linked poly(A)+ RNA-RNP complexes and analysis of cross-linked Hrb1-GFP by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were done essentially as described previously (29Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 1.5 liters of the wild type strain HKY36 or mtr10-7 mutant strain (HKY270) was grown to A600 of 1.0 and if indicated shifted to 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were harvested, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and split in two equal portions each. The first portion was not UV-irradiated, and the second portion was UV-irradiated for 2 × 2.5 min on ice in the Stratalinker (Stratagene). All samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer. The poly(A)+ RNA was purified and the proteins analyzed as described previously (29Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Russell I. Tollervey D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 293-301PubMed Google Scholar). All eluate samples were loaded normalized to the purified RNA and 10 A260 units were loaded per lane. The Western blots were detected using anti-GFP antibodies (1:5000) and the SuperSignal® West Femto Kit (Pierce). Hrb1 Is a Nuclear SR-type Protein That Requires the Karyopherin Mtr10 and the SR-specific Protein Kinase Sky1 for Its Proper Nuclear Localization—Hrb1 is highly homologues to the SR-type mRNA-binding proteins, Gbp2 and Npl3. The protein shows an overall identity of 47% to Gbp2 and 23% to Npl3, respectively (Fig. 1A). It is comprised of three RNA recognition motifs and one serine/arginine-rich domain with 10 SR or RS motifs. This SR domain contains also two arginine/glycine/glycine (RGG) motifs, which for Npl3 have been shown previously to be substrates for arginine methylation by the arginine methyltransferase Hmt1 (31Henry M.F. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3668-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 32Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3128-3136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A functional GFP fusion of the protein is localized to the nucleus at steady state, and its import is mediated by the import receptor Mtr10 (Fig. 1, B and C). Strains with mutations in genes encoding different import receptors were grown to log phase before they were shifted to 37 °C for various times. Hrb1 keeps its nuclear localization in kap104-16, kap123Δ, and pse1-1 strains (data not shown). In contrast, it is localized to the cytoplasm of a mtr10-7 mutant strain at the non permissive temperature (Fig. 1C). Thus, Mtr10 is necessary for proper import of Hrb1. These data are further supported by affinity purification experiments that identified Hrb1 as a co-purifying protein of ProtA-tagged Mtr10 (21Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the localization of Hrb1 in a knock-out strain of SKY1, encoding the only SR-specific protein kinase in yeast, shifted slightly to the cytoplasm, indicating that phosphorylation of Hrb1 might be involved in localizing HRB1 properly to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). The observed mislocalization phenotype is very similar to the Npl3 localization in SKY1 deletion strains, and it has been discussed that phosphorylation of Npl3 is necessary for Mtr10 binding (19Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, cytoplasmic accumulation has been explained by a slowed import rate. It has also been discussed that phosphorylation increases the affinity of the SR proteins for specific mRNA targets (35Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 334-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 36Tacke R. Chen Y. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, in a different model lacking phosphorylation could result in an unspecific binding of the SR proteins to any mRNA, which also could lead to an increased cytoplasmic localization, observed in SKY1 knock-out strains. Hrb1 Binds to Poly(A)+RNA in Vivo—The overall structural features of Hrb1 indicate that it is an RNA-binding protein. We therefore tested its ability to bind to poly(A)+ RNA in vivo by UV cross-linking experiments. Yeast cell lysates of log phase cells were purified using oligo(dT)-cellulose columns and compared with the resulting eluates on Western blots (Fig. 2), clearly demonstrating that Hrb1 binds to poly(A)+ RNA in vivo. Interestingly, similar to what was shown for Npl3 and Gbp2 before (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), binding of Hrb1 to poly(A)+ RNA is significantly enhanced in mtr10 mutant strains, shifted to 37 °C for 30 min prior to cross-linking, indicating that Mtr10 might be involved in dissociation of Hrb1 from the mRNA in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). In fact, since all three SR proteins show an increased binding to poly(A)+ RNA when Mtr10 is not functional (Fig. 2 and Refs. 18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), Mtr10-induced dissociation of the SR proteins seems to be a general mechanism for this type of proteins. Overexpression of HRB1 Saturates Its Import Receptor—In expectance of Hrb1 to be a shuttling protein (33Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we searched for conditions in which the export rate of the protein exceeds its import rate and in this way would enable us to study the export requirements of Hrb1. To possibly saturate its import receptor Mtr10, we overexpressed HRB1-GFP from the strong GAL1 promoter, shifted the strain to 37 °C, and analyzed the cellular localization of the protein. Indeed, we found that high level Hrb1 results in a cytoplasmic localization phenotype (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, as expected, simultaneous overexpression of MTR10 rescues the cytoplasmic mislocalization (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that the steady state localization of Hrb1 can be shifted from one cellular compartment to the other by tuning the protein level, and moreover, Mtr10 seems to be a bottleneck for Hrb1 import. Overexpression of HRB1 is not toxic to cells (Fig. 3B). Wild type strains carrying either an empty vector or HRB1-GFP, GPB2-GFP, or NPL3-GFP under the strong GAL1 promoter were grown to log phase before 10-fold serial dilutions were spotted on either a glucose plate (uninduced) or a galactose plate (induced) and incubated for 3–4 days at 25 °C. In contrast to overexpression of GBP2 and NPL3, high copy HRB1 did not change the growth rate of wild type cells (Fig. 3B). The reason for this difference might be the altered localization of Hrb1 when overexpressed. High copy Hrb1 is cytoplasmic (Fig. 3A), whereas both Gbp2 and Npl3 are nuclear even when overexpressed (data not shown and (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Flach J. Bossie M. Vogel J. Corbett A. Jinks T. Willins D.A. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8399-8407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). This indicates a harmful interfering effect of elevated SR protein levels in the nucleus. Taken together, since overproduction of HRB1 is not toxic to cells and a simultaneous overexpression of MTR10 restores the nuclear localization of the otherwise cytoplasmic protein, we have established a method to shift the steady state localization of the protein allowing us to investigate the export requirements of Hrb1. Different Export Requirements for the Three Shuttling SR-type Proteins Hrb1, Gbp2, and Npl3—All three shuttling SR proteins in yeast are localized to the nucleus at steady state but shifted to the cytoplasm when either mutated in the SR domain (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) or overexpressed (Fig. 3A). Single amino acid residue exchanges in NPL3 and GBP2 (npl3-S411A and gbp2-S15A) alter the localization of each protein (Fig. 4, top row), and it has been discussed that either lack of phosphorylation and/or reduced binding to Mtr10 causes the observed phenotype (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Since the cytoplasmic presence of the SR proteins at steady state neither influence the growth rate of the yeast strains nor the intracellular localization of the mRNA (data not shown), we were able to compare the export requirements of all three SR proteins. All strains carrying plasmids with either GAL1-HRB1-GFP, gbp2-S15A-GFP, or npl3-S411A-GFP were shifted to 37 °C for 1 h prior to analysis. As expected, the nuclear export of all three SR proteins is dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription as shown in rpb1-1 mutants (Fig. 4). Similarly, when the mRNA export is blocked in mutants of the nuclear export receptor MEX67, mex67-5, the export of Hrb1, Gbp2, and Npl3 is inhibited (Fig. 4). At the same time, the localization of a control reporter protein is not affected under these conditions (data not shown and (18Windgassen M. Krebber H. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). Thus, all three SR proteins function similar in that ongoing transcription and a functional mRNA export machinery are required for their cytoplasmic entry. However, differences are indicated by analysis of their localization in hmt1 knock-out strains. Cells deleted for the arginine methyltransferase retain Npl3 and Hrb1 but not Gbp2 in the nucleus (Fig. 4). These findings are consistent with in vitro arginine methylation studies, in which Npl3 and Hrb1 were shown to be substrates of Hmt1 (33Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Most strikingly, however, differences in the export requirements are obvious in mutants of the THO complex, responsible for transcription elongation. While the export of both Hrb1 and Gbp2 is blocked in deletion strains of MFT1 and HPR1, only a slight nuclear accumulation is visible for Npl3 after a 1-h shift to 37 °C (Fig. 4). Interestingly, all three SR proteins are mislocalized to a similar extend in THP2 deletion strains (Fig. 4), indicating either a general function for Thp2 on all three SR proteins or on general mRNA elongation. Unfortunately, expression of all three genes is significantly reduced in THO2 knock-out strains not allowing the localization studies. Together, these data indicate an intimate relationship between Hrb1, Gbp2, and the THO complex. In contrast to 100% retained Hrb1 and Gbp2 in the nucleus of both hpr1 and mft2, we find a maximum of 15% nuclear Npl3 signal in hpr1 and even less in mtf2 mutants. This strict dependence of Hrb1 and Gbp2 on the THO complex components Hpr1 and Mft1 is in agreement with observations that Hrb1 and Gbp2 (13Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R. Hurt E. Nature. 2002; 417: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) but not Npl3 co-purify with the THO complex. 2K. Strässer, personal communication. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Hrb1 and Gbp2 might be loaded onto the mRNA via Mtf1 and Hpr1, two of the THO complex components during transcription elongation, while Npl3 loading might occur independent of Mft1 and Hpr1. In fact, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and co-immunoprecipitations with Npl3 revealed that the protein directly interacts with RNA-polymerase II and is recruited early to the growing mRNA (38Lei E.P. Krebber H. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1771-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Together, we have shown the characterization of Hrb1 as the third shuttling SR-type mRNA-binding protein in yeast, which accompanies the transported mRNAs to the cytoplasm. While the import requirements of all three SR proteins are similar, we reveal striking differences in the export requirements of these proteins and thus provide novel insights into the different mechanisms by which the SR proteins might be recruited to the growing mRNAs. We are grateful to A. Aguilera, C. Guthrie, E. Hurt, and P. A. Silver and K. Sträβer for strains and plasmids. We thank H. Bastians for discussion and critically reading the manuscript."

Interestingly, through yeast two-hybrid analysis, LMADS1 was found to be capable of forming homodimers. These results indicated that LMADS1 represents an ancestral form of the B function protein, which retains the ability to form homodimers in regulating petal and stamen development in lily. To explore the involvement of the conserved motifs in the C-terminal region of LMADS1 in forming homodimers, truncated forms of LMADS1 were generated, and their ability to form homodimers was analyzed using yeast two-hybrid and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The ability of LMADS1 to form homodimers decreased once the C-terminal paleoAP3 motif was deleted. When both paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs were deleted, the ability of LMADS1 to form homodimers was completely abolished. This result indicated that although the paleoAP3 motif promotes the formation of LMADS1 homodimers, the PI-derived motif is essential. Deletion analysis indicated that two amino acids, RV, of the 5 final amino acids, YEFRV, in the PI-derived motif are essential for the formation of homodimers. Further, point mutation analysis indicated that amino acid Val was absolutely necessary, whereas residue Arg played a less important role in the formation of homodimers. Furthermore, Arabidopsis AP3 was able to form homodimers once its C-terminal region was replaced by that of LMADS1.

In addition to AP3 and PI, many MADS box genes showing sequences similar to B function genes have also been identified (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on sequence diversity, B group genes were divided into one PI and three major AP3-like gene lineages (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B group genes have been proposed to have arisen from by two major duplication events from an ancestral gene possessing both paleoAP3 and PI motifs in the C-terminal end of the protein (4Theissen G.

The first duplication generated paleoAP3 and PI lineages. The paleoAP3 lineage composed of AP3 orthologues has been identified in gymnosperm, lower eudicots, magnolid dicot, and monocots (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Winter K.U. Weiser C. Kaufmann K. Bohne A. Kirchner C. Kanno A. Saedler H. Theissen G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Genes in this lineage contain both conserved paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs. Members of the PI lineage lost the paleoAP3 motif and were composed of PI orthologues in most plant species. The PI motif was, however, highly conserved throughout the PI lineage after duplication (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second duplication from the paleoAP3 lineage generated two genes. These two genes encounter significant sequence changes in dicots and generated the euAP3 and TM6 gene lineages during evolution (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hsu H.-F. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Vandenbussche M. Theissen G. Van de Peer Y. Gerats T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The paleoAP3 motif was retained in TM6 lineages and replaced by a conserved euAP3 motif in the AP3 lineage of most eudicot species (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vandenbussche M. Theissen G. Van de Peer Y. Gerats T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In contrast to the B function genes in the euAP3, paleoAP3, and PI lineages, which are known to be responsible for petal and stamen development, genes in the TM6 lineage have distinct expression patterns, although their real function remains unclear (8Kramer E.M. Dorit R.L. Irish V.F. Genetics. 1998; 149: 765-783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yu D. Kotilainen M. Pollanen E. Mehto M. Elomaa P. Helariutta Y. Albert V.A. Teeri T.H.

Different from other MADS box proteins, which form homodimers in regulating flower development, in various plant species, proteins in the euAP3 and paleoAP3 lineages were stable and functional in the cell, regulating petal and stamen development only in heterodimer form with a protein in the PI lineage (9Schwarz-Sommer Z.

A. 1996; 93: 4793-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For example, heterodimers were formed between AP3 and PI in Arabidopsis (29Vandenbussche M. Theissen G. Van de Peer Y. Gerats T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO) in Antirrhinum (9Schwarz-Sommer Z. Hue I. Huijser P. Flor P.J. Hansen R.

Biol. 1999; 40: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), respectively. This partnership was supported by the expression pattern for AP3 and PI orthologues. They are expressed at the same time and in the same areas, in petals and stamens, during flower development (11Tröbner W. Ramirez L. Motte P. Hue I. Huijser P. Lönnig W.E. Saedler H. Sommer H. Schwarz-Sommer Z. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4693-4704Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 31Goto K. Meyerowitz E.M.

Furthermore, expression of AP3 and PI orthologues is maintained by an autoregulatory circuit (6Jack T. Brockman L.L. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 683-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 7Jack T. Fox G.L. Meyerowitz E.M.

AP3/PI or DEF/GLO heterodimers autoregulated their own expression by binding to the specific CArG sequence elements in their promoter regions. Therefore, it is interesting to explore the origin of this obligate nature of heterodimerization for AP3/PI during evolution. Because there was only one B gene before duplication, it is postulated that the ancestral B protein should function as a homodimer in regulating gene expression (17Winter K.U. Weiser C. Kaufmann K. Bohne A. Kirchner C. Kanno A. Saedler H. Theissen G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The ability of B proteins to form homodimers was gradually lost and replaced by a preference to form heterodimers with other B proteins. This assumption was supported by a recent finding that the LMADS1 of the monocot lily (Lilium longiflorum) in paleoAP3 lineage was able to form homodimers in regulating flower development (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An orchid (Oncidium Gower Ramsey) AP3-like protein OMADS3 is also able to strongly form homodimers (28Hsu H.-F. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1198-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A similar result was observed for the lily (Lilium regale) PI orthologue and an ancestral B protein from the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon, which have the ability to bind DNA as a homodimer (17Winter K.U. Weiser C. Kaufmann K. Bohne A. Kirchner C. Kanno A. Saedler H. Theissen G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition to forming homodimers, LMADS1 was also able to form heterodimers with Arabidopsis PI and produced dominant negative ap3-like mutations in transgenic Arabidopsis plants (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Complete consensus sequence by LMADS1 to the paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs in the C-terminal region of the protein is an indication of its ancestry to the B function gene (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, LMADS1 has become an excellent candidate for studying the transition from homodimerization to heterodimerization of B function proteins during evolution. To explore the possible involvement of the conserved paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs in the C-terminal region of LMADS1 in forming homodimers, various deletions and point mutations in the two motifs within the truncated LMADS1 were executed, and the subsequent ability of truncated LMADS1 to form homodimers was analyzed. The result indicated that these two motifs were absolutely essential for LMADS1 to form homodimers. This conclusion was further supported by the result that Arabidopsis AP3 acquired the ability to form homodimers once its C-terminal region was replaced by that of LMADS1. Generation of Various Truncated cDNAs for LMADS1—The various truncated cDNA for LMADS1 were amplified by PCR using plasmid pGBKT7-LMADS1 (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates (see Fig. 1A). Specific 5′ primer used in PCR was L1–5 (5′-TTCTGCGAATTCTCCACAGAC-3′), and the specific 3′ primers for each construct are as follows: L1-C1, delete paleoAP3 motif (LMADS1–219; 5′-GGATCCCTAATGCAGGTTTGGCTG-3′); L1-C2, delete paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–203; 5′-GGATCCCTACAGATGAGAAGCCCC-3′); L1-C2–1, delete paleoAP3 and the last 2 amino acids of PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–214; 5′-GGATCCTTAGTTTGGCTGGCTCGG-3′); L1-C2–2, delete paleoAP3 and the last 4 amino acids of PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–212; 5′-GGATCCTTACTGGCTCGGTTGGAC-3′); L1-C2–3, delete paleoAP3 and the last 6 amino acids of PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–210; 5′-GGATCCTTACGGTTGGACTCGGAA-3′); L1-C2–4, delete paleoAP3 and the last 8 amino acids of PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–208; 5′-GGATCCTTAGACTCGGAACTCGTA-3′); and L1-C2–5, delete paleoAP3 and the last 10 amino acids of PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–206; 5′-GGATCCTTAGAACTCGTACAGATG-3′). Specific 5′ and 3′ primers contained either the generated EcoRI recognition site (5′-GAATTC-3′, underlined) or BamHI recognition site (5′-GGATCC-3′, underlined) to facilitate the cloning of cDNAs. For these constructs, all of the 3′ primers contained a TAG or TAA stop codon (bold type) created right before the BamHI recognition site. PCR fragments were digested with appropriate enzymes and ligated into either plasmid pGBKT7 (binding domain vector) or PGADT7 (activation domain vector) for yeast two-hybrid analysis. Generation of cDNAs with Point Mutation and Amino Acid Substitution for LMADS1—The various cDNA-contained point mutations for LMADS1 were amplified by PCR using plasmid pGBKT7-LMADS1 (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates (see Fig. 1A). The specific 5′ primer used in PCR was L1–5 (5′-TTCTGCGAATTCTCCACAGAC-3′) and the 3′ specific primers for each construct are as follows: L1-R207A, with Arg substituted by Ala at position 207 (LMADS1-R207A; 5′-GGATCCTTAGACTGCGAACTCGTA-3′); L1-V208A, with Val substituted by Ala at position 208 (LMADS1-V208A; 5′-GGATCCTTAGGCTCGGAACTCGTA-3′); L1-V208R, with Val substituted by Arg at position 208 (LMADS1-V208R; 5′-GGATCCTTAGCGTCGGAACTCGTA-3′); and L1-RV208AA, with Arg substituted by Ala at position 207 and Val substituted by Ala at position 208 (LMADS1-RV208AA; 5′-GGATCCTTAGGCTGCGAACTCGTA-3′). Specific 5′ and 3′ primers contained either the generated EcoRI recognition site (5′-GAATTC-3′, underlined) or BamHI recognition site (5′-GGATCC-3′, underlined) to facilitate the cloning of cDNAs. For these constructs, all of the 3′ primers contained a TAA stop codon created right before the BamHI recognition site. The DNA sequences mutated are in bold type and underlined. The PCR fragments were digested with appropriate enzymes and ligated into either plasmid pGBKT7 (binding domain vector) or PGADT7 (activation domain vector) for yeast two-hybrid analysis. Generation of Chimeric AP3 and PI cDNAs Containing C-terminal Portion of LMADS1—PCR was used to generate the chimeric cDNAs, AP3-L1C and PI-L1C in which the C-terminal region of AP3 or PI were replaced by that of LMADS1 (see Fig. 1B). For generation of AP3-L1C, two cDNAs (AP3-C and P3-L1C) were first produced by PCR. Primers P3-EI (5′-GAATTCATGCCTAACACCACAACGA-3′) and the P3-C (5′-CGAGTTTTTGTTCTTTTTCTTGGTG-3′) were used in PCR using pGBKT7-AP3-M (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as template to produce AP3-C that encoded 97 amino acids of intervening (I) 1The abbreviations used are: I, intervening; K, keratin-like; M, MADS; C, C-terminal; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase. and keratin-like (K) domains of AP3 protein (see Fig. 1B). Primers P3-L1C (5′-GAAAAAGAACAAAAACTCGGAAGAAG-3′) and the L1BI (5′-CAGGATCCGGGTTTCAAGCC-3′) were used in PCR using pGBKT7-LMADS1-M (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates to produce P3-L1C that encoded 73 amino acids of the C-terminal (C) domain of the LMADS1 protein (see Fig. 1B). A second round of PCR using P3-EI and the L1BI as primers and cDNAs AP3-C and P3-L1C as templates was performed to generate chimeric cDNA AP3-L1C that produced a protein fused with the N-terminal I and K domains of AP3 and the C-terminal domain of LMADS1 (see Fig. 1B). A similar strategy was used to generate PI-L1C. For generation of PI-L1C, two cDNAs (PI-C and I-L1C) were first produced by PCR. Primers I-EI (5′-GAATTCCATATGGGTAGAGGAAAGATCGA-3′) and the I-C (5′-CTTGTGTGCTTCTTCCGCCATCATCTT-3′) were used in PCR using pGBKT7-PI (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates to produce cDNA PI-C that encoded 154 amino acids of N-terminal portion (M, I, and K domains) of PI protein. Primers I-L1C (5′-ATGATGGCGGAAGAAGCACACAAGAACT-3′) and the L1BI (5′-CAGGATCCGGGTTTCAAGCC-3′) were used in PCR using pGBKT7-LMADS1-M (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates to produce cDNA I-L1C that encoded 71 amino acids of the C-terminal domain of LMADS1 protein. A second round of PCR using I-EI and the L1BI as primers and cDNAs PI-C and I-L1C as templates was performed to generated chimeric cDNA PI-L1C that produced a protein fused with the N terminus of PI and C-terminal domain of LMADS1. For generation of cDNAs truncated with paleoAP3 or PI-derived motifs in the 3′ end of AP3-L1C, combinations of specific primers were used in PCR. The 5′ specific primer is P3-EI. The 3′ specific primer for deletion of paleoAP3 motif (AP3-L1C-219) is L1-C1. The 3′ primer for deletion of paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs (AP3-L1C-203) is L1-C2. Specific 5′ and 3′ primers contained the generated EcoRI or BamHI recognition site to facilitate the cloning of cDNAs. PCR fragments were digested with appropriate enzymes and ligated into either plasmid pGBKT7 (binding domain vector) or PGADT7 (activation domain vector) for yeast two-hybrid analysis. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech). In this system, yeast strain Y187 was used for transformation, and lacZ was used as the reporter gene. Yeast transformation was performed by using the lithium acetate method (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiesti R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 201425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2882) Google Scholar). The transformants co-transformed with binding domain plasmid and activation domain plasmid were selected on selection medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (-Trp-Leu) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the analysis of β-galactosidase activity, positive transformants grown on selection medium were further grown and suspended into Z buffer (100 mm Na-PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) containing o-nitriphenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer) as a substrate. β-Galactosidase activity was calculated according to Miller (36Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 74Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The sequence of the CArG1 oligonucleotide (GCAACTCTTTTCCTTTTTAGGTCGCATATGGTC) used in the EMSA is derived from the Antirrhinum DEF promoter (17Winter K.U. Weiser C. Kaufmann K. Bohne A. Kirchner C. Kanno A. Saedler H. Theissen G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were labeled with 32P at their 5′ ends and gel purified prior to EMSA. The GST fusion proteins were all generated from recombinant pGEX-4T plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The various truncated cDNA for LMADS1 used to generate GST fusion proteins were amplified by PCR using plasmid pGBKT7-LMADS1 (24Tzeng T.-Y. Yang C.-H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) as templates (see Fig. 1A). 5′ primer specific used in PCR was L1–5BI (5′-GGATCCATGGGGCGGGGAAAGAT-3′) and the 3′ specific primers for each construct are as follows: L1–3EI, without deletion (LMADS1; 5′-GAATTCTCAAGCCAGTCGGAGAT-3′); L1-EIC1, delete paleoAP3 motif (LMADS1–219E; 5′-GAATTCTCAATGCAGGTTTGGCTG-3′); and L1-EIC2, delete paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–203E; 5′-GAATTCTCACAGATGAGAAGCCCC-3′). Specific 5′ and 3′ primers contained either the generated BamHI recognition site (5′-GGATCC-3′, underlined) or EcoRI recognition site (5′-GAATTC-3′, underlined) to facilitate the cloning of cDNAs. For these constructs, all 3′ primers contained a TGA stop codon created right before the EcoRI recognition site. The proteins were purified with glutathione-Sephadex beads (Amersham Biosciences). For EMSA, different amounts of the fusion proteins were preincubated with 100 ng of pBSKS and 8 mg of bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 5 min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol in a total volume of 20 ml. The labeled oligonucleotides were then added, and the samples were further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. To separate the protein-DNA complexes, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a running nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel that had been prerun for 30 min at 4 °C and 200 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Electrophoresis was further carried out at 4 °C and 200 V for 2.5 h. The gels were dried and exposed on x-ray film at -80 °C. For competition experiments, a 120-fold molar excess of the cold competitor DNAs was included in the binding reactions. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of antisera was individually incubated with the GST fusion proteins at room temperature for 15 min prior to their use in the binding reactions. paleoAP3 and PI-derived Motifs Are Required for The Formation of LMADS1 Homodimers—To explore the possible involvement of the paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs in the C terminus of LMADS1 in the formation of homodimers, constructs containing cDNAs with deletions of the paleoAP3 motif (LMADS1–219) or both the paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs (LMADS1–203) (Fig. 1A) were transformed into yeast followed by two-hybrid analysis. As shown in Figs. 1A and 2, the ability of LMADS1–219 to form homodimers was decreased to approximately 75% of that for full-length LMADS1. This suggested a positive role for the paleoAP3 motif in the formation of homodimers in LMADS1. Interestingly, the ability of LMADS1 to form homodimers was completely abolished once both the paleoAP3 and PI-derived motifs were deleted as seen in LMADS1–203 (Figs. 1A and 2). This result indicated that the PI-derived motif was essential for the formation of homodimers in LMADS1 once the paleoAP3 motif was absent. As controls, neither PI nor AP3 formed homodimers (Fig. 2). To further confirm the result obtained from yeast two-hybrid analysis, EMSA, a technique established for the investigation of dimerization and DNA binding of MIKC-type MADS domain proteins (9Schwarz-Sommer Z.

As shown in Fig. 3, LMADS1 proteins bound efficiently to probe CArG1. The binding of LMADS1 proteins to CArG1 was confirmed by the supershift assay in which the signal of protein-DNA complexes was shifted (from position of arrow 1 to that of arrow 2 in Fig. 3) once the GST antisera were added (Fig. 3)."
https://openalex.org/W2132881389,"The vacuolating cytotoxin VacA is an important virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori. Removing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-Ps) from the cell surface by phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C or disrupting the cell actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D reduced VacA-induced vacuolation of cells (Ricci V., Galmiche, A., Doye, A., Necchi, V., Solcia, E., and Boquet, P. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 3897-3909). Using the fluorescent dye 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium chloride, an indicator for cytosolic chloride, we have investigated the role of either GPI-Ps or actin cytoskeleton in the activity of the selective anionic channel formed by VacA at the plasma membrane level. Removal of GPI-Ps from HeLa cell surfaces did not impair VacA localization into lipid rafts but strongly reduced VacA channel-mediated cell influx and efflux of chloride. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of HeLa cells by cytochalasin D did not affect VacA localization in lipid rafts but blocked VacA cell internalization and inhibited cell vacuolation while increasing the overall chloride transport by the toxin channel at the cell surface. Specific enlargement of Rab7-positive compartments induced by VacA could be mimicked by the weak base chloroquine alone, and the vacuolating activities of either chloroquine alone or VacA were blocked with the same potency by the anion channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid shown to inhibit VacA channel activity (Tombola, F., Oregna, F., Brutsche, S., Szabo, I., Del Giudice, G., Rappuoli, R., Montecucco, C., Papini, E., and Zoratti, M. (1999) FEBS Lett. 460, 221-225). We suggest that formation of functional VacA channels at the cell surface required GPI-Ps and that endocytosis of these channels by an actin-dependent process increases the chloride content of late endosomes that accumulate weak bases, provoking their enlargement by osmotic swelling.

Tompkins L. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). VacA is a single chain protein (molecular mass, 90 kDa) that contains N-terminal (p34; molecular mass, 34 kDa) and C-terminal (p58; molecular mass, 58 kDa) polypeptide domains (4Cover T.L. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Cells such as HeLa incubated with monomeric VacA (but not with the oligomeric form of the toxin) in the presence of weak bases such as NH4Cl, developed large Rab7-positive intracellular vacuoles (i.e. late endosomes) (7Papini E. de Bernard M.

Purified VacA must be “activated” by a rapid acid or alkaline treatment to render it monomeric (2Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). VacA-induced vacuolation strictly requires an active V-ATPase on the endosomal membrane to allow vesicular acidification (2Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L.

The presence of similar anionic channels formed by VacA was then detected at the level of the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and found only when the toxin was activated (11Tombola F. Oregna F.

There is evidence that links the formation of VacA anionic channel to the toxin-induced vacuolation (2Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear where the VacA channel is formed in the cell because vacuolation can be induced by intracellular expression of the toxin (2Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The toxin may assemble a channel directly at the cell surface (12Szabò I. Brutsche S. Tombola F. Moschioni M. Satin B.

For instance, both the number of toxin oligomers and the characteristics of the molecular ultrastructure of the VacA channel were found to be different from those observed in artificial lipid bilayers (15Adrian M.

It has been furthermore reported that although GPI-Ps were not apparently required directly for the binding of VacA to cells (17Kuo C.H. Wang W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Although GPI-Ps appear to freely diffuse throughout the cell plasma membrane, they may reside preferentially in detergent-resistant membrane domains (named lipid rafts (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar)) (22Varma R. Mayor S.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In addition, treatment of cells with the cholesterol-sequestering drug nystatin or β-methylcyclodextrin, known to disrupt lipid rafts, strongly impaired VacA activity (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Schraw W. Li Y. McClain M.S. van der Goot F.G. Cover T.L. J. Biol.

Blanke S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4120-4123Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This indicated that lipid rafts are involved in the molecular mechanism of VacA-induced vacuolation. Accordingly, it has been shown that VacA is associated with lipid rafts (20Schraw W. Li Y. McClain M.S. van der Goot F.G. Cover T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34642-34650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Patel H.K. Willhite D.C. Patel R.M. Ye D. Williams C.L. Torres E.M. Marty K.B. MacDonald R.A. Blanke S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4120-4123Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton appears also to play an important role in VacA-induced vacuolation. It was first reported that conditional expression of dominant positive or negative mutant forms of Rho GTPases, well known regulators of F-actin structures organization, were able to modulate the vacuolation induced by VacA (25Hotchin N.A. Cover T.L. Aktar N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14009-14012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Then it was shown that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by CD was able to decrease the toxin-induced vacuolation of HEp-2 cells without impairing the intracellular activity by which VacA provokes the formation of large vacuoles (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present work we have examined the effects of the removal of GPI-Ps from the cell surface or the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, treatments both known to reduce VacA-induced vacuolation (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), on the activity of the anion-selective channel formed by the toxin in HeLa cells. We have shown that GPI-Ps are lipid raft components required for the formation of active or fully functional VacA channels at the level of the cell surface but not for the cell binding of the toxin. In contrast, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of HeLa cells did not interfere with the VacA pore transport of chloride ions and even increased its anion channel function. Finally, we have shown that specific swelling of Rab7-positive compartment, a characteristic feature of VacA (2Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), could also be achieved with low concentrations of the weak base chloroquine alone and that the anion channel blocker NPPB inhibited not only the VacA-induced vacuolation but also the chloroquine-induced vacuolation. Cell Line, Transfection, Bacterial Strain, VacA Toxin, and Antibodies—HeLa cells (human cervix carcinoma), a gift form Dr. T. L. Cover (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), were cultured and transfected as previously described (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with eukaryotic vectors allowing the expression of proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP), namely: GFP-Rab 7, a fusion at the N terminus of Rab 7 with GFP; and GFP-Rab 5, also a fusion at the N terminus of Rab 5 with GFP. These constructs were kindly provided by Dr. A. Galmiche (INSERM U452, Nice, France). The VacA-producing H. pylori 60190 strain (ATCC 49503, with a type s1a/m1 vacA genotype) was used to produced the cytotoxin. Purification of VacA was achieved according to Cover and Blaser (26Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 267: 10570-10575Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Immediately before use on cells, purified VacA was activated according to de Bernard et al. (27de Bernard M. Papini E. de Filippis V. Gottardi E. Telford J. Manetti R. Fontana A. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23937-23940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The anti-VacA rabbit polyclonal IgG 958 (16Garner J.A. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4197-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), kindly given by Dr. T. L. Cover (Vanderbilt University), was used throughout this work. The anti-CD55 was a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) directed against the GPI-P CD55 (28Davitz M.A. Low M.G. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1150-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse mAb anti-CD59 (29Deckert M. Ticchioni M. Bernard A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. M. Deckert (INSERM U576, Nice, France). The mAb anti-flotillin-1 was from BD Biosciences (Le Pont de Claix, France). Secondary antibody against rabbit IgG labeled with Texas Red was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Anti-mouse IgG antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate as well as anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Dako (A/S, Denmark). Phalloidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate was from Sigma-Aldrich. Neutral Red Dye Uptake, Acridine Orange Assay, Time Lapse Imaging, PI-PLC, CD and NPPB Cell Treatments, Immunofluorescence, and Immunoblotting—The degree of cell vacuolation was quantified by means of neutral red dye uptake assay and was expressed as micrograms of neutral red/micrograms of cell protein (30Ricci V. Sommi P. Fiocca R. Romano M. Solcia E. Ventura U. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In experiments using chloroquine without VacA to induce cell vacuolation, after triple rinsing in HBSS cells were incubated for 5 h in HBSS containing 1 mm chloroquine. In experiments testing the effect of NPPB (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) on cell vacuolation, NPPB was added in HBSS-NH4Cl or HBSS-chloroquine. The pH-sensitive fluorescent dye acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich) (5 μg/ml) was incubated with living cells for 10 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline in the dark. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the living cells where then directly observed by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS-SP, Heidelberg, Germany). For time lapse imaging, the cells were filmed for 2 h in constant conditions of 5% CO2 and 37 °C and observed by phase contrast optics using an Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) with shutter-controlled illumination (Carl Zeiss) and cooled digital CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Evry, France). The images were recorded at 1 frame/30 s and accelerated at 10 frames/s in the videos using Metamorph 2.0 image analysis software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Evry, France) and QuickTime pro 5 (Apple). The treatments with PI-PLC and CD (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed as previously described (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), excepted that the incubation of cells with PI-PLC (in HBSS containing cycloheximide to prevent further synthesis of GPI-anchored proteins) was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. The anion channels blocker NPPB was added, after VacA intoxication, at the indicated concentrations. The immunofluorescence studies were performed as described previously (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer on nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Patch Clamp and MEQ Chloride Transport Assays—The whole cell patch clamp configuration was used. To control the absence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channels in HeLa cells, 10 μm dibromo-AMPc (Sigma-Aldrich) plus 10 μm forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Whole cell currents were monitored with an RK 400 amplifier (Biologic, Münster, Germany). In all experiments the membrane potential was clamped at -50 mV, and 400-ms pulses were applied in 20-mV steps from -100 to +80 mV, with 3-s intervals between pulses. MEQ was synthesized in the laboratory and utilized according to Biwersi and Verkman (31Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Changes in fluorescence were recorded with a CCD camera (Photonics Sci, Robertsbridge, UK). The results were analyzed using the Axon software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). For each experiment, fluorescence from microscopic fields, each containing an average of 8-24 cells, was recorded and quantified. The results are expressed as relative fluorescence F/F0, where F is the fluorescence as a function of time, and F0 is the minimum fluorescence recorded after fluorescence quenching with the final thiocyanate substitution (140 mm potassium thiocyanate, 3 mm calcium gluconate, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4). The histograms represent the change rate of the fluorescence (absolute values) of three independent experiments during the substitutions with either NaCl medium (NM) or gluconate medium (GM). The osmolarity of all media was adjusted with mannitol to 340 milliosmoles. Analysis of Lipid Rafts by Density Gradient—The cells (3 × 106) were plated in 100-mm tissue culture dishes 24 h before use. Activated VacA was added to cells for 1 h in HBSS at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and transferred into warmed HBSS (37 °C) for the indicated period of time. After triple rinsing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were scraped off the dishes in calcium-free phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged (1000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The cells were then lysed 30 min at 4 °C in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mix of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Optiprep 60 (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) was added to the lysate at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) to obtain a 40% final concentration. A layer of Optiprep 30% (Optiprep 60 diluted in TNE) and a final layer of TNE were respectively added. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 2 h, 4 °C), eight fractions from the top to the bottom of the tube were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. The immunoblots were scanned, and quantification of the signals was performed using the NIH Image 1.63 software. Ultrastructural Studies and VacA Immunogold Labeling—HeLa cells treated with CD for 1 h and incubated with CD and acid-activated VacA (2 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) or with a mixture of 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 1 h. The cell pellets were washed with phosphate buffer, embedded in 10% (w/v) gelatin, and infused in 2.3 m sucrose. Mounted gelatin blocks were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ultrathin sections were prepared with an ultracryomicrotome (Leica, Vienna, Austria). Ultrathin cryosections were collected with 2% (w/v) methylcellulose, 2.3 m sucrose, and immunogold-labeled with VacA antibodies and anti-rabbit IgG coupled to 10-nm gold particles. The VacA Channel Activity, Inserted in the HeLa Cell Plasma Membrane, Can Be Tested by the Technique Using the Halide-sensitive Fluorescent Probe MEQ—Incubation of HeLa cells for 30 min at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml of acid-activated purified VacA induced a clear increase in the cell current studied by the whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (11Tombola F. Oregna F. Brutsche S. Szabò I. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Szabò I. Brutsche S. Tombola F.

The current was inhibited by the addition of 100 μm of the chloride channel blocker NPPB (Fig. 1A), indicating that VacA caused a chloride flux as previously reported (11Tombola F. Oregna F. Brutsche S. Szabò I. Del Giudice G. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12Szabò I. Brutsche S. Tombola F.

Channel activity required toxin acid activation (not shown), and as reported (12Szabò I. Brutsche S. Tombola F. Moschioni M. Satin B. Telford J.L. Rappuoli R. Montecucco C. Papini E. Zoratti M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5517-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), no interference with cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel in HeLa cells appeared to be possible because no current increase was detected after the addition of forskolin and dibromo-AMPc to the patched cell (Fig. 1A). Because the whole cell patch clamp technique does not allow observation of channels in a large number of cells for a long period of time or is cumbersome after various cell treatments (such as CD or PI-PLC), we decided to use the fluorescent dye MEQ, an indicator for cytosolic chloride (31Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In aqueous buffers, the fluorescence of MEQ is quenched by Cl-, thereby allowing a quantification of this ion in the cytosol (31Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7879-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with acid-activated VacA for 30 min at 37 °C, loaded with MEQ at 20 °C for 5 min, and tested at room temperature (20 °C) for the formation of chloride channels. Substitution of the NM by GM should lead to an increase of MEQ fluorescence (dequenching) if chloride channels are functional in the cell plasma membrane. A subsequent substitution by NM should induce an influx of Cl- ions and thus a quenching of MEQ fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the absence of VacA no modification of MEQ fluorescence was observed by 10-min substitutions by either GM or NM. When the cells were intoxicated with 2 μg/ml of acid-activated VacA, iterative substitutions by GM followed by subsequent additions of NM resulted in a series of increase and decrease in MEQ fluorescence (Fig. 1B). The MEQ fluorescence technique therefore allowed us to measure the presence of channels for chloride transport formed by the VacA toxin. VacA channels activity appeared to be stable for a long time without any significant decrease in the anion transport as expected if the toxin channels were endocytosed. This may be due to the fact that the MEQ assay was performed at 20 °C, a temperature at which there is a low activity of membrane internalization, thus possibly allowing toxin channels to stay at the cell surface. The chloride channel activity of VacA appeared concentration-dependent (Fig. 1C), and channel formation required the acid activation of the toxin (Fig. 1C). Depolymerization of Actin Cytoskeleton of HeLa Cells by CD Blocks Toxin Endocytosis—We next examined whether PI-PLC and CD treatments were also effective in reducing the VacA-induced vacuolation in HeLa cells. For this purpose we used the pH-sensitive indicator acridine orange that accumulates and decorates the large vacuoles formed by VacA. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of HeLa cells with 2 μg/ml of VacA in the presence of 5 mm NH4Cl for 4 h induced the formation of numerous, large, acidic vacuoles as compared with untreated preparation (Fig. 2A). Treatment of cells with PI-PLC before their incubation with VacA strongly reduced the formation of large vacuoles (Fig. 2A). The efficiency of PI-PLC treatment was controlled by the ability of this phospholipase to remove the GPI-P CD59 (29Deckert M. Ticchioni M. Bernard A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). As previously shown (18Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by CD also blocked the formation of large acidic vacuoles in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). We next investigated whether the entry of VacA was still occurring when cells were treated with the actin-depolymerizing agent CD. For that purpose we studied by indirect immunofluorescence and co"
https://openalex.org/W1985290691,"Abstract Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins and their functional homologs, replication protein A, are essential components of cellular DNA replication, repair and recombination. We describe here the isolation and characterization of multiple replication protein A homologs, RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, from the archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans. RPA1 comprises four single-stranded DNA-binding domains, while RPA2 and RPA3 are each composed of two such domains and a zinc finger domain. Gel filtration analysis suggested that RPA1 exists as homotetramers and homodimers in solution, while RPA2 and RPA3 form only homodimers. Unlike the multiple RPA proteins found in other Archaea and eukaryotes, each of the M. acetivorans RPAs can act as a distinct single-stranded DNA-binding protein. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence polarization anisotropy studies revealed that the M. acetivorans RPAs bind to as few as 10 single-stranded DNA bases. However, more stable binding is achieved with single-stranded DNA of 18-23 bases, and for such substrates the estimated Kd was 3.82 ± 0.28 nm, 173.6 ± 105.17 nm, and 5.92 ± 0.23 nm, for RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, respectively. The architectures of the M. acetivorans RPAs are different from those of hitherto reported homologs. Thus, these proteins may represent novel forms of replication protein A. Most importantly, our results show that the three RPAs and their combinations highly stimulate the primer extension capacity of M. acetivorans DNA polymerase BI. Although bacterial SSB and eukaryotic RPA have been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis by their cognate DNA polymerases, our findings provide the first in vitro biochemical evidence for the conservation of this property in an archaeon."

Our purpose was to determine the effect of a high glucose (HG) condition on the interleukin-6/soluble interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6/sIL-6R)-induced activation of signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). In this study, HGFs were cultured for at least two passages under a normal glucose (NG; 5.5 mm) condition or high glucose (25 mm) condition. Importantly, the HG condition significantly induced expression of gp130 mRNA in HGFs compared with levels in control cells. Consistent with the expression of its mRNA, the HG condition also increased the expression of gp130 protein, and phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue by gp130 was enhanced significantly by IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation. Furthermore, the HG condition enhanced the IL-6/sIL-6R-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and led to subsequent activation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein in nuclei. In contrast, there was no significant difference in phosphorylation of JNK between the HG and NG condition. Interestingly, HGFs increased IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 mRNA expression and VEGF165 secretion under the HG condition compared with levels under the NG condition. In contrast, the induction of VEGF165 secretion was partially inhibited by PD98059 (selective p44/42 MAPK inhibitor) under the HG condition. In addition, the VEGF165 secretion was completely inhibited by the combination of PD98059 and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor). Our findings suggest that the HG condition indirectly increases VEGF expression via activation of gp130-mediated p44/42 MAPK-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein signaling in HGFs. Thus, elevated VEGF secretion in HGFs under the HG condition may play a role in the development of the severe periodontitis observed in diabetic patients.

Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease with several major complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy (1Rogus J.J. Warram J.H. Krolewski A.S. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1655-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 2Ritz E. Orth S.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Several studies have reported that hyperglycemia and subsequent biochemical events were correlated with the development of their diseases, although the precise mechanism of them remains unclear (3Kahn B.B.

Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1973-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). It has been generally accepted that bacterial infection-induced inflammatory periodontal disease, so-called periodontitis, is one of the diabetic complications (5Soskolne W.A. Klinger A. Ann. Periodontol. 2001; 6: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Poor metabolic control of diabetes mellitus has often been associated with the severity of periodontitis (6Iacopino A.M. Ann.

Periodontol. 2001; 28: 840-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We reported previously that IL-6 signals in the presence of the soluble form of IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) are initiated in the phosphorylation of gp130 in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) (9Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Nishimura F. Chou H.H. Arai H. Yamada H. Murayama Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At least two distinct signaling cascades, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, have been activated in cytoplasm and lead to various responses in HGFs (9Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Nishimura F. Chou H.H. Arai H. Yamada H. Murayama Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that acts as a specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells through specific cell surface receptors (10Isner J.M. Vale P.R. Symes J.F. Losordo D.W. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 11Benjamin L.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1181-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of cDNAs for the VEGF family has revealed the existence of at least four isoforms of 206, 189, 165, and 121 amino acids produced as a result of alternative splicing (12Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). VEGF165 is the most abundant isoform expressed in the majority of normal human tissues (12Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). VEGF121 is also well expressed in many normal tissues, however its biological activity has been shown to be 10–100-fold weaker than that of VEGF165 (12Thomas K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). VEGF is also one of the major factors promoting diabetic complications and is implicated in the development of neovascularization and endothelial dysfunction in diabetic vascular complications (13Witmer A.N.

Periodontol. 2003; 74: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported that VEGF is increased in gingival tissues of diabetic patients, especially those with periodontitis. Therefore, VEGF could be as an important mediator in the severe periodontitis seen in diabetic patients, although the precise mechanism remains unknown. HGFs are the most abundant cells in gingival connective tissues and play an important role in the control of inflammation in inflamed gingiva (9Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Nishimura F. Chou H.H. Arai H. Yamada H. Murayama Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that VEGF165 expression is significantly induced by IL-6 in the presence of sIL-6R in HGFs (16Naruishi K. Nishimura F. Yamada-Naruishi H. Omori K. Yamaguchi M. Takashiba S. Transplantation. 2003; 76: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our finding suggests that IL-6 promotes angiogenesis in inflamed gingiva via VEGF expression by HGFs, resulting in progression of periodontitis. However, little has been known about the effects of the high glucose (HG) condition on VEGF expression in HGFs. Unveiling this precise mechanism may contribute to clarifying the pathogenesis of severe periodontitis in diabetic patients. In the present study, we have examined the regulation of VEGF expression by HGFs under the HG condition and further evaluated the effects of the HG condition on the IL-6-mediated signaling pathway involved in VEGF expression in HGFs. Cell Culture—HGFs were prepared as reported previously (9Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Nishimura F. Chou H.H. Arai H. Yamada H. Murayama Y. J. Dent. Res. 2001; 80: 1421-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and were divided into the normal glucose (NG) group, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal bovine serum containing 5.5 mm glucose, or the HG group, incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose. HGFs were cultured under the NG or HG condition and were stimulated with a combination of 50 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 and 50 ng/ml recombinant human sIL-6R at the indicated periods. As an osmotic control for HG, cells were also cultured in NG medium supplemented with mannitol (5.5 mm glucose + 19.5 mm mannitol). To examine the effect of the p44/42 MAPK pathway on IL-6-induced CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) activation or VEGF165 secretion, 50 μm PD98059 was added 60 min before and during stimulations. To examine the effect of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) pathway on IL-6-induced activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation or VEGF165 secretion, 50 μm SP600125 was added 60 min before and during stimulations. Informed consent was obtained from each volunteer before participation. Reagents—Recombinant human IL-6 and recombinant human sIL-6R were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies to phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-JNK were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Mannitol was purchased from Nakarai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Antibody to actin was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies to phosphotyrosine and to STAT3 were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibody to gp130 and consensus oligonucleotides for AP-1 and C/EBP were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Selective p44/42 MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 and specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 were obtained from Calbiochem. Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Messenger RNAs for gp130, VEGF, and β-actin were detected and semiquantified by the methods described previously (17Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Chou H.H. Arai H. Nishimura F. Murayama Y. J. Periodontal Res. 1999; 34: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HGFs using TriZol LS reagent (Invitrogen), and first strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript™ Preamplification System (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sets of PCR primers used were as follows: gp130, 5′-TCT CCT TGA GCA AAC TTT GGG G-3′ for forward and 5′-ACA TGC TTT GGG TGG AAT GG-3′ for reverse (17Naruishi K. Takashiba S. Chou H.H. Arai H.

The thermal cycle (25, 30 cycles) contained the following profile: denaturation, 95 °C for 1 min; annealing, 55 °C for gp130, 64 °C for VEGF and 60 °C for β-actin for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. For semiquantification, the amounts of mRNAs encoding both gp130 and VEGF were estimated by the relative intensity against the intensity of cDNA encoding β-actin. Western Blot Analysis—Total cellular protein was extracted with lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mix (Complete™; Roche Applied Science). The lysates (10 μg each) were separated in a denaturing 7.5–12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were then blocked with 6% skim milk in TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and subsequently incubated with antibodies against gp130, phosphotyrosine, STAT3, and each phospho-MAPK protein. Antibody against actin was used as an internal control of loading proteins. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PER™ Reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using Gel Shift Assay Systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Consensus double strand oligonucleotides for C/EBP and AP-1 were end labeled with 3,000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) and 0.5 ng of labeled probe were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.2 × TGE (0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 m glycine, 0.01 m EDTA) at 80 V. The gels were transferred to filter paper, vacuum dried, and autoradiographed at –80 °C for 48 h. Immunoassay for VEGF165—After cells were cultured under the indicated conditions, supernatants were collected and stocked at –80 °C until use. The amount of VEGF165 was measured using sandwich ELISA kits with antibody specific for human VEGF165 (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Statistical Analysis—Statistical evaluations were performed by Student's t test using a statistical program, StatView software (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Induction of Gp130 mRNA and Its Protein Expression in the HG Condition—To examine the effects of the HG condition on gp130 expression, HGFs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing either NG (5.5 mm glucose) or HG (25 mm glucose), for at least two passages in this medium. As an osmotic control for HG, cells were also cultured in NG medium supplemented with mannitol (5.5 mm glucose + 19.5 mm mannitol). As shown in Fig. 1, we demonstrated that accumulation of gp130 mRNA was enhanced significantly under the HG condition (25 cycle: p < 0.0001, versus NG, NG + mannitol; 30 cycle: p = 0.0023, versus NG, p = 0.0020, versus NG + mannitol). Also, there was no significant difference in gp130 mRNA levels between the NG alone and the NG + mannitol group. Consistent with the expression of gp130 mRNA, the HG condition also significantly increased expression of gp130 protein in HGFs, resulting in 1.8-fold higher than that under the NG condition (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). An equivalent concentration of mannitol had no significant effect on either gp130 mRNA or its protein expression, suggesting that glucose-induced up-regulation of gp130 was independent of osmolality.Fig. 2HG enhances gp130 expression. HGFs were cultured under the 25 mm glucose (HG) or 5.5 mm glucose (NG) condition. As an osmotic control for HG, cells were also cultured in NG medium supplemented with 19.5 mm mannitol (MN). A, cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody to gp130 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are representative of three independent experiments.

On the other hand, there was no significant difference in the amount of IL-6/sIL-6R-induced STAT3 phosphorylation between the HG and NG condition (Fig. 3). The signals downstream of gp130 phosphorylation were examined further. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was enhanced significantly by IL-6/sIL-6R under the HG condition, whereas there was no significant difference in the amount of IL-6/sIL-6R-induced JNK phosphorylation between the HG and NG conditions although it was induced by IL-6/sIL-6R (Fig. 4). In contrast, IL-6/sIL-6R did not activate the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at all. To determine whether the HG condition enhances IL-6/sIL-6R-induced DNA binding activity of C/EBP or AP-1, we examined the kinetics of their binding activity in IL-6/sIL-6R-treated cells cultured under the HG condition. As shown in Fig. 5, IL-6/sIL-6R-induced C/EBP binding activity increased 3.4-fold over the control levels at 4 h, whereas IL-6/sIL-6R had no significant effect on the AP-1 binding to activity at 4 h despite the stimulation. These bindings were competed efficiently with 200-fold molar excess of the same unlabeled oligonucleotides.Fig. 4HG enhances IL-6/sIL-6R-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK. HGFs were cultured under the HG or NG condition and stimulated by IL-6 and sIL-6R (50 ng/ml each) for the indicated periods of time. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-JNK as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The density of each protein band was analyzed by a densitometry measurement, and relative levels of each protein were expressed as percentage of control, normalized by the corresponding actin level.

In addition, accumulation of VEGF121 mRNA also increased similarly. The HG condition without IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation had no effect on the induction of VEGF mRNA accumulation. Increase of IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 Secretion in the HG Condition and Effects of p44/42 MAPK and JNK Inhibitors—To determine the effects of the HG condition on VEGF165 secretion in HGFs, the levels of VEGF165 secreted into the culture medium were measured using specific ELISA methods. As shown in Fig. 7, IL-6/sIL-6R significantly increased VEGF165 secretion in HGFs, even in the NG condition (24, 48 h, p < 0.001 versus untreated cells). Furthermore, IL-6/sIL-6R dramatically increased VEGF165 secretion under the HG condition (24 h, p < 0.01; 48 h, p < 0.001 versus NG). To confirm the effects of the p44/42 MAPK pathway on IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 secretion, we examined whether the selective p44/42 MAPK inhibitor PD98059 inhibits VEGF165 secretion. PD98059 partially inhibited VEGF165 secretion in HGFs. Furthermore, to confirm the effects of the JNK pathway on IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 secretion, we examined whether the JNK inhibitor SP600125 inhibits VEGF165 secretion. SP600125 also partially inhibited VEGF165 secretion in HGFs. In addition, VEGF165 secretion was inhibited completely by the combination of PD98059 and SP600125 to the base-line level. No Effect of Glucose Stimulation on VEGF165 Secretion— VEGF165 secretion by HGFs was observed constitutively under different concentration of glucose. As shown in Fig. 8, in the absence of added IL-6/sIL-6R, the amount of secreted VEGF165 remained base line at any concentration of glucose tested at 24 and 48 h. However, especially at 48 h, the addition of either 16.5 or 25 mm glucose to IL-6/sIL-6R resulted in a significantly greater degree of VEGF165 secretion compared with lower concentrations of added glucose. Cellular responses to elevated extracellular glucose are thought to contribute to the development of diabetic complications (19Lopes-Virella M.F. Virella G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 40-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including severe periodontitis (15Unlu F. Guneri P.G. Hekimgil M. Yesilbek B. Boyacioglu H. J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that chronic HG exposure significantly increased gp130 mRNA as well as its protein expression in HGFs (Figs. 1 and 2). This overexpression of gp130 is probably not related to the osmotic effects of HG because the same concentration of mannitol had no effect on gp130 expression. It has been widely accepted that gp130 is a common receptor for the IL-6 family such as IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (20Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether activation of gp130 could be enhanced by elevated glucose in HGFs. As shown in Fig. 3, HG significantly enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 by IL-6/sIL-6R. The intracellular signaling pathways evoked by gp130 activation include the Janus kinase/STAT pathway and the Ras-MAPKs pathway (20Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Funamoto et al. (21Funamoto M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Osugi T. Hirota H. Izumi M. Yoshizaki K. Walsh K. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10561-10566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) reported that gp130-mediated signals increase VEGF expression via the Janus kinase/STAT3 pathway in cardiac myocytes, whereas we demonstrated that HG showed no increase in IL-6/sIL-6R-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in HGFs (Fig. 3). This discrepancy might be caused by the difference in cell types used in experiments. Next, we examined the possibility that activation of MAPK cascades is enhanced by IL-6/sIL-6R in HGFs cultured under the HG condition. There are at least three distinct MAPK families: 1) p44/42 MAPK or extracellular-regulated kinases, 2) p38 MAPK or the stress/cytokine activated kinases, and 3) JNK/stress-activated protein kinases known as the JNKs/SAPKs (22Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3511) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was enhanced significantly by IL-6/sIL-6R in HGFs cultured under the HG condition. Phosphorylation of JNK by IL-6/sIL-6R was almost same level between NG and HG. In contrast, IL-6/sIL-6R had no effect on phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. These findings suggest that HG dramatically enhances the gp130-mediated p44/42 MAPK pathway in IL-6/sIL-6R-treated HGFs. We have found recently that IL-6/sIL-6R increases VEGF expression in HGFs via the JNK pathway (16Naruishi K. Nishimura F. Yamada-Naruishi H. Omori K. Yamaguchi M. Takashiba S. Transplantation. 2003; 76: 1380-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). AP-1 is one of the JNK-mediated transcription factors involved in the regulation of VEGF expression (23Wei D. Williams D. Browder W. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Importantly, as shown in Fig. 5, we demonstrated that HG significantly enhanced C/EBP-DNA binding rather than AP-1-DNA binding at 4 h after IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation. In addition, we obtained promoter sequences of VEGF gene from GenBank (accession no. AF095785) and searched possible binding sequences of C/EBP on the promoter using SIGSCAN version 4.05 (24Ghosh D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 445-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As expected, several consensus sequences, including a binding site for C/EBP, could be found in the promoter of the VEGF gene. These results support that overexpression of gp130 caused by HG results in the specific activation of p44/42 MAPK and its downstream transcription factor C/EBP, leading to VEGF expression in HGFs. The p44/42 MAPK is activated by phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by dual specificity kinase MEK1, which induces their translocation into the nucleus where they activate or suppress a variety of transcription factors involved in growth and differentiation (25Prusty D. Park B. Davis K.E. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46226-46232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the gp130-mediated p44/42 MAPK-C/EBP pathway we identified is involved in the regulation of VEGF expression, we examined the effect of HG on IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF mRNA expression and the amount of VEGF secretion in HGFs cultured with or without PD98059. As expected, HG enhanced IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 mRNA expression in HGFs (Fig. 6). Furthermore, we found that HG also significantly enhanced IL-6/sIL-6R-induced VEGF165 secretion and demonstrated that PD98059 partially inhibits the enhancement of VEGF165 secretion (Fig. 7). Also, we demonstrated that PD98059 completely inhibits the C/EBP-DNA binding (Fig. 5). These results suggest that induction of VEGF165 is dependent on the activation of the gp130-mediated p44/42 MAPK-C/EBP signaling pathway in HGFs cultured under the HG condition. Several transcription factors of the C/EBP family have been identified so far in different tissues, and the C/EBP family regulates a variety of cellular phenotypes in a wide range of cell types (26Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least six isoforms of this family, α, β, γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ, which can both homodimerize and heterodimerize with each other and bind to the same C/EBP regulatory element in the promoters of many different genes (27Hamm J.K. Park B.H. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18464-18471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To clarify the isoforms of C/EBP activated by IL-6/sIL-6R under the HG condition, further elucidation is needed using supershift analysis. In addition, we found that the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 also partially inhibits the enhancement of VEGF165 secretion (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we demonstrated that VEGF165 secretion is completely inhibited in HGFs cultured with a combination of PD98059 and SP600125. PD98059 especially is known as a highly selective inhibitor of p44/42 MAPK activation and does not inhibit activation of other protein kinases (28Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). However, this regulation would be subject to further experiments using dominant negative form of each MAPK because these pharmacological selective inhibitors may not fully reflect the outcome in an intracellular pathway. Interestingly, it was reported that the JNK/AP-1 pathway might be responsible for the greater induction and activation of C/EBP in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages (29Cho Y.H. Lee C.H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 512-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that VEGF expression by HGFs may be also mediated, directly or indirectly, at least in part, via the JNK/AP-1 signaling pathway, although IL-6/sIL-6R had no significant effect on the AP-1 binding to DNA under the HG condition. VEGF165 secretion remained at base-line level at any concentration of glucose at the 24-h time point, although it was slightly up-regulated at 16.5 mm glucose. However, it was up-regulated by IL-6/sIL-6R stimulation at 25 mm glucose at this time point. The IL-6 signaling pathway was also strongly activated under this condition. This tendency turned remarkable at the 48-h time point (Fig. 8). Although it is possible that the events observed in HGFs may occur in humans, direct experimental confirmation will be required. Furthermore, it has been reported that HG alone induces VEGF expression in vascular muscle cells (30Natarajan R. Bai W. Lanting L. Gonzales N. Nadler J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2224-H2231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and glomerular podocytes (31Hoshi S. Nomoto K. Kuromitsu J. Tomari S. Nagata M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In our study, we found that HG alone had no significant effect on the VEGF165 secretion in HGFs (Fig. 8). The distinctive feature of HGFs in VEGF expression might explain the difference of clinical observation in various tissues and organs in diabetic patients. VEGF is known as a vascular permeability factor based on its ability to induce vascular leakage (32Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In fact, VEGF-induced vascular permeability may be critical for its angiogenic action, as it provides a provision fibrin matrix essential for endothelial cell spouting and migration. Furthermore, in addition to its angiogenic activity and vascular permeable property, VEGF has an important role in indirect monocyte chemoattraction through the up-regulation of chemokines including MCP-1 and IL-8 (33Lee T.H. Avraham H. Lee S.H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10445-10451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, VEGF could be a key regulator of inflammatory responses, leading to severe periodontitis. Clinically in diabetic patients, we often experience the gingiva interrupted in the circulation such as ischemia rather than angiogenic. It is difficult to explain this discrepancy based on the roles of VEGF in hyperglycemic gingiva. However, HGFs stimulated by IL-6/sIL-6R might play an important role in this discrepancy of pathogenesis. It might be assumed that HGFs overexpressing gp130 under the HG condition enhance the VEGF secretion by IL-6/sIL-6R and lead to angiogenic and then severe destruction in inflamed gingiva. Therefore, IL-6 might be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of severe periodontitis in diabetic patients. Funatsu et al. (34Funatsu H. Yamashita H. Shimizu E. Kojima R. Hori S. Retina. 2001; 21: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that aqueous levels of VEGF and IL-6 were significantly correlated with the severity of diabetic retinopathy, although the role of IL-6 in diabetic retinopathy is unclear (34Funatsu H. Yamashita H. Shimizu E. Kojima R. Hori S. Retina. 2001; 21: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that oral infections such as periodontitis increase the risk of various systemic diseases after inflammatory cytokines including VEGF entered the bloodstream. Thus, VEGF produced by HGFs may affect the progression of nearby diabetic retinopathy. Appropriate periodontal therapy might exert beneficial effects on VEGF-mediated diabetic complications such as retinopathy. In summary, we demonstrated that HG indirectly increases VEGF expression via a gp130-mediated signaling pathway in HGFs (Fig. 9). This pathway could be an attractive target for clarifying the pathophysiology of severe periodontitis in diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2050301669,"In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, activation of receptors that couple to the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins causes hypertrophic growth, together with expression of “hypertrophic marker” genes, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and myosin light chain 2 (MLC2). As reported previously for other Gq-coupled receptors, stimulation of α1-adrenergic receptors with phenylephrine (50 μm) caused phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors as well as activation of ERK1/2, cellular growth, and ANP transcription. These responses depended on EGF receptor activation. In marked contrast, stimulation of Gq-coupled purinergic receptors with UTP caused EGF receptor phosphorylation, ERK1/2 activation, and cellular growth but minimal increases in ANP transcription. UTP inhibited phenylephrine-dependent transcription from ANP and MLC2 promoters but not transcription from myoglobin promoters or from AP-1 elements. Myocardin is a muscle-specific transcription enhancer that activates transcription from ANP and MLC2 promoters but not myoglobin promoters or AP-1 elements. UTP inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses to overexpressed myocardin but did not inhibit responses to c-Jun, GATA4, or serum response factor, all of which are active in nonmuscle cells. Thus, UTP inhibits transcriptional responses to phenylephrine only at cardiac-specific promoters, and this may involve the muscle-specific transcription enhancer, myocardin. These studies show that EGF receptor activation is necessary but not sufficient for ANP and MLC2 responses to activation of Gq-coupled receptors in ventricular myocytes, because inhibitory mechanisms can oppose such stimulation. ANP is a compensatory and protective factor in cardiac hypertrophy, and mechanisms that reduce its generation need to be defined.

ANP is a compensatory and protective factor in cardiac hypertrophy, and mechanisms that reduce its generation need to be defined. Hearts respond to a range of pathological insults by increasing muscle mass, caused primarily by hypertrophic growth of the cardiomyocytes and by specific changes in the program of gene transcription. Hypertrophy in response to pressure overload involves heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq/11 class (1Esposito G. Rapacciuolo A. Naga Prasad S.V. Takaoka H. Thomas S.A. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and activation of Gq is sufficient to cause hypertrophy in vivo (2Dorn G.W. Brown J.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as well as in cell models (3Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, activation of Gq-coupled receptors including α1-adrenergic receptors (α1-AR), 1The abbreviations used are: AR, adrenergic receptor; NRVM, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte(s); ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; MLC2, myosin light chain 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; PLC, phospholipase C; PE, phenylephrine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; DMEM, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium; 2xTRE, TRE2PRL(–36); JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SRF, serum response factor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine; InsP, [3H]inositol phosphate; DN, dominant negative; Mb, myoglobin; MKK, mitogen-activated kinase kinase. ETA receptors or AT1 receptors on neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM) causes increased growth of the cardiomyocytes, as well as increasing transcription from “hypertrophic” marker genes, such as ANP and MLC2 (3Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways associated with increased protein synthesis, and hence cell size, are known to be partly independent of those causing re-expression of ANP and MLC2, but both can be activated by Gq (4Boluyt M.O. Zheng J.S. Younes A. Long X.L. ONeill L. Silverman H. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be expected that any receptor that activates Gq would initiate hypertrophic growth and marker gene expression in NRVM. In agreement with this, we have recently reported that activation of Gq-coupled purinergic receptors with UTP increases cardiomyocyte size and stimulates downstream MAP kinase activation, in an apparently similar manner to activation of α1-AR with phenylephrine (PE) (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulating phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) isoforms, Gq-coupled receptors can induce transactivation of certain growth factor receptors (6Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In NRVM, exogenous AT1 receptors mediate phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), and this appears to be critical for subsequent growth responses (7Thomas W.G. Brandenburger Y. Autelitano D.J. Pham T. Qian H.W. Hannan R.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Direct activation of Gq by means of an activating toxin (from Pasteurella multocida) has similar effects, implying Gq mediation (8Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, whether all Gq-coupled receptors transactivate EGFR and whether EGFR activation is critical for growth or gene transcription are still not certain. Possibly of more importance, it is not known whether EGFR activation is sufficient for any of these responses and whether downstream responses to EGFR phosphorylation vary depending on the nature of the stimulus. In the current studies, we have compared responses to stimulation of purinergic receptors with UTP to stimulation of α1-AR with PE. Both factors caused phosphorylation of EGFR, and both activated ERK1/2 via mechanisms involving EGFR. However, α1-AR activation caused increased transcription of ANP, whereas UTP was relatively ineffective, even though it increased cell growth. Recent studies have presented evidence that ANP and the related peptides BNP and CNP have beneficial effects on the hypertrophying cardiomyocytes by limiting cellular growth responses (9Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that purinergic receptors initiate cardiomyocyte growth without substantial increases in ANP transcription suggests the possibility of a more malignant type of hypertrophy (10Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1275-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The current manuscript investigates the reason for this difference in ANP response to α1-AR agonists versus purinergic stimulation. Culture of Neonatal Cardiomyocytes—NRVM cultures were prepared from 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as previously described (11Woodcock E.A. Wang B.H. Arthur J.F. Lennard A. Matkovich S.J.

The cells were preplated twice for 30 min each to remove nonmyocytes and left to attach for 18 h in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate onto uncoated dishes. The medium was then replaced with a defined serum-free medium consisting of DMEM, 10 μg/ml human insulin, 10 μg/ml bovine apo-transferrin, 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine, 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 125 μg/ml fungizone. Bromodeoxyuridine was omitted after 3 days. Measurement of NRVM Hypertrophy—NRVM (400 cells/mm2) were treated with 100 μm UTP or 50 μm PE (plus 1 μm propranolol) with fresh additions of UTP every 8 h. After 48 h the cells were harvested into buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.7, and the samples were assayed for protein (12Peterson G.L. Anal.

ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—NRVM plated on 9-cm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer at pH 7.7 containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm NaF, together with 5 μm okadaic acid, 1 μm pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the protein content of the supernatants was measured (12Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Proteins from whole cell lysates (150–300 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (14Cannon-Carlson S. Tang J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 146-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma), blocked for 1 h in 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), and probed overnight at 4 °C with phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies (1:2000) diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T. Secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution, and the blots were incubated for 1 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were subsequently stripped and reprobed with antibodies to total ERK1/2 (1/2000). Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Activity—The ANP-luciferase plasmid (pANP(–638)LΔ5′) and the MLC2-luciferase plasmid (pMLC(–250)LΔ5), the AP-1-luciferase plasmid (TRE2PRL(–36)) (2xTRE), and the myoglobin-luciferase construct have been described previously (15Shubeita H.E.

Cytosolic fractions were harvested into lysis buffer containing 0.1 m K2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9. Luciferase activity was measured in 100 mm Tricine, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 75 μm luciferin, pH 7.8, for 2 min using a Lumat LB9507 Luminometer. EGF Receptor Phosphorylation—NRVM plated on 9-cm dishes were washed with ice-cold saline and harvested by rocking in 800 μl of lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation to remove particulate matter. Equal quantities of protein (1.5–3 mg) were diluted to 2.5 ml with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (JRH Biosciences), pH 7.0, and immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-EGFR antibody (1/200) at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were harvested using protein A-Sepharose, separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, and probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine and EGFR. Similar protocols were used for ErbB2 and ErbB4 phosphorylation. Quantification of ANP mRNA—Total RNA was extracted using acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (18Chomczynsky P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63171) Google Scholar). ANP mRNA was measured using RNase protection analysis, as described previously (19Harrison S.N. Autelitano D.J. Wang B.H. Milano C. Du X.J. Woodcock E.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1232-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Measurement of PLC Activity—NRVM were labeled with [3H]inositol (5 μCi/ml), washed with unlabeled medium, and pretreated with 10 mm LiCl in DMEM for 10 min prior to the addition of agonists. [3H]Inositol phosphates (InsPs) were extracted with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm phytic acid, and the supernatants were subsequently treated with a 1:1 mixture of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane:tri-n-octylamine to remove remaining trichloroacetic acid. The aqueous phase containing [3H]InsPs was subjected to chromatography on Dowex 1 columns for total [3H]InsP measurement. Treatment of Data—The differences between treatment groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons and accepted as statistically significant at p < 0.05. Unless otherwise noted, the results shown are from representative experiments performed in triplicate, which were performed in independent NRVM preparations at least three times. Materials—Fetal calf serum used during NRVM isolation was specially selected for low endotoxin and obtained from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Parkville, Australia). DMEM, Hepes, and other materials for the preparation of cell culture solutions and media were cell culture grade, obtained from Sigma, and dissolved in milliQ H2O. Other reagents were obtained from Sigma or BDH/AnalaR and were of analytical reagent grade. The antibodies were from the following sources: phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and ErbB2 were from Cell Signaling Technology; ErbB1 and phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10) were from Up-state Biotechnology, Inc.; and ErbB4 was from Santa Cruz. UTP and PE Cause Growth of NRVM, but Only PE Substantially Increases Transcription of ANP—We have recently reported that UTP causes hypertrophic growth of NRVM via Gq-coupled P2Y-purinergic receptors (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the current study we examined this hypertrophic response with a view to defining critical signaling pathways. NRVM were treated with the purinergic receptor agonist UTP (100 μm) or the α1-AR agonist PE (50 μm, plus 1 μm propranolol), for 48h. Total cell lysates were prepared and assayed for DNA and protein. As shown in Fig. 1, UTP and PE caused similar increases in the protein/DNA ratio. Furthermore, the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG-1478 (5 μm) reduced responses to both agonists, implying involvement of transactivated EGFR. We next compared the abilities of UTP and PE to induce ANP transcription, a well established marker for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. NRVM were treated with UTP (100 μm) or PE (50 μm, plus 1 μm propranolol) for 48 h. RNA was extracted, and ANP mRNA was quantified by RNase protection. PE caused a substantial increase in ANP transcription, but in contrast, UTP caused only a small increase when added alone and inhibited the ANP mRNA responses to PE when the two agonists were added together (Fig. 2). PE and UTP Phosphorylate EGF Receptors—Sustained intense activation of Gq in NRVM, either by stimulating overexpressed AT1 receptors (7Thomas W.G. Brandenburger Y. Autelitano D.J. Pham T. Qian H.W. Hannan R.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) or by treatment with an activating toxin (recombinant P. multocida toxin, rPMT) (8Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), causes phosphorylation of EGF receptors (ErbB1, EGFR) via a transactivation process and initiates downstream hypertrophic signaling pathways. Transactivation of EGFR by endogenously expressed receptors is less well documented. AG-1478 had inhibited growth responses to both UTP and PE, and we next measured EGFR phosphorylation in response to activation of endogenously expressed purinergic receptors with UTP or α1-AR with PE. NRVM were treated with UTP (100 μm) or PE (50 μm, plus 1 μm propranolol) for 10 min. The lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. PE and UTP both caused transactivation of EGFR (ErbB1), as shown by increased tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Neither UTP nor PE caused detectable phosphorylation of ErbB2 or ErbB4, even though these responded to neuregulin (NRGβ2). Thus, purinergic receptors and α1-AR transactivate ErbB family members in an apparently similar manner. UTP and PE Activate ERK1/2 via EGFR Transactivation—We next examined whether downstream signaling from these two receptor classes required EGFR transactivation. NRVM were pretreated with AG-1478 (5 μm) for 10 min and then UTP (100 μm) or PE (50 μm plus 1 μm propranolol) was added for a further 10 min. The cells were lysed, and the extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred, and probed with antibodies to phosphorylated ERK1/2. UTP and PE both caused activation of ERK1/2, and responses to both agonists were substantially inhibited by AG-1478 (Fig. 4). We have previously reported that neither of these agonists caused detectable activation of JNKs or p38 MAPKs in these cells under the conditions of our experiments (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PE Increases Transcription of ANP via Gq and EGFR Transactivation—Given the failure of UTP to induce a robust ANP transcriptional response, even though UTP couples to Gq and transactivates EGFR, we next examined the ANP response to PE and its dependence on Gq and EGFR. To do this, we transfected NRVM with an ANP-luciferase construct, together with other plasmids expressing Gαq or a dominant negative EGFR (EGFR-DN) and measured luciferase activity as an index of ANP gene transcription. PE (50 μm plus 1 μm propranolol) was added, and the cells were harvested after a further 20 h. Overexpression of Gαq increased ANP transcription and markedly enhanced responses to PE. PE responses were inhibited by overexpression of EGFR-DN or by the addition of 5 μm AG-1478 (Fig. 5). Neither the EGFR-DN nor AG-1478 inhibited ANP responses to overexpression of MKK7, the immediate activator of JNK (Fig. 5, inset), confirming that the inhibition by EGFR-DN and AG-1478 was not nonspecific nor a consequence of cytotoxicity. The experiments show that the ANP response to PE involves Gq and EGFR, even though UTP, which also activates Gq and EGFR, is relatively ineffective in increasing ANP transcription and inhibits responses to PE. Similar results were obtained when MLC2 transcription was measured using an MLC-luciferase construct (data not shown). UTP Inhibits ANP and MLC Transcription when Activated by PE or Gq, but Not Early Signaling Responses—We next investigated the UTP inhibition of PE-activated transcription from ANP and MLC2 promoters. NRVM were transfected with ANP-luciferase or MLC2-luciferase together with Gαq or blank vector and subsequently stimulated with 50 μm PE plus 1 μm propranolol, and then ANP and MLC2 responses were measured after 20 h. UTP inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses to PE, Gαq, and PE plus Gαq, as shown in Fig. 6. Such inhibition of PE responses might reflect cross-desenstization of α1-AR by purinergic receptors. To address this possibility, we examined effects of UTP on immediate signaling responses to PE, PLC activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. NRVM were labeled with [3H]inositol, pretreated with LiCl, and then stimulated for 20 min with 50 μm PE (plus 1 μm propranolol), with 100 μm UTP, or with the two agonists together. InsPs were extracted and quantified. Both PE and UTP activated PLC, as demonstrated by increased [3H]InsPs and the two agonists produced an additive response when added together (Fig. 7, upper panel). UTP also did not inhibit the ERK1/2 response to PE (Fig. 7, lower panel). Thus, UTP exerts an inhibitory effect on ANP and MLC2 responses but does not inhibit signaling responses proximal to the receptor. This argues against cross-desensitization of α1-ARs by purinergic receptor activation. The lack of inhibition of proximal events, as well as the finding that UTP inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses even in the presence of overexpressed Gαq, also shows that the purinergic inhibition of PE transcriptional responses is not due to competition for available Gq. UTP Does Not Inhibit Responses from an NFAT-sensitive Myoglobin Promoter or from AP-1 Response Elements—PE activates promoters other than ANP and MLC2 in cardiomyocytes, and we next examined whether UTP inhibited all of these responses. Similar experiments to those described above were performed using myoglobin (Mb)-luciferase or 2xTRE-luciferase, constructs responsive to NFAT or AP-1 elements, respectively. NRVM were transfected with Mb-luciferase or 2xTRE-luciferase, subsequently treated with 50 μm PE (plus 1 μm propranolol) or with 100 μm UTP and luciferase activity measured after 20 h. Both PE and UTP caused increased transcription from Mb-luciferase and 2xTRE-luciferase reporter constructs, and the response to UTP was quantitatively similar to the PE response. Furthermore, UTP did not inhibit responses to PE, in contrast to findings with ANP- and MLC2-luciferase constructs (Fig. 8). Thus, the inhibitory effect of UTP is restricted to cardiac-specific promoters, even though NFAT and AP-1 elements are activated by hypertrophic stimuli such as PE (20Pu W.T. Ma Q. Izumo S. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Omura T. Yoshiyama M. Yoshida K. Nakamura Y. Kim S. Iwao H. Takeuchi K. Yoshikawa J. Hypertension. 2002; 39: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). UTP Selectively Inhibits ANP and MLC Responses to Myocardin—The data had shown that UTP selectively inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses to PE but not events close to the receptors. This pointed to a UTP inhibited step beyond immediate signaling responses. The failure of UTP to inhibit PE responses at myoglobin promoters or AP-1 elements suggested selective inhibition of cardiac-specific promoters. Myocardin is a newly described transcription enhancer that confers muscle specificity on the ubiquitous transcription factor, SRF (17Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether UTP inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses to overexpression of myocardin. NRVM were transfected with ANP- or MLC-luciferase constructs together with plasmids expressing myocardin. UTP (100 μm) was added, and luciferase activity was measured after 20 h. Myocardin caused substantial activation of ANP transcription at all concentrations tested, with very high activation observed at the highest concentration of added DNA, as reported previously (17Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). UTP inhibited ANP transcription at all of these myocardin doses (Fig. 9A). For comparison, the experiments were also performed with overexpressed GATA4, c-Jun + JNK, and SRF, transcription factors not restricted to muscle-specific genes. All of the transcription factors increased ANP transcription, but in contrast to myocardin, the responses were not inhibited by UTP (Fig. 9B). Responses to myocardin were synergistic with the PE response, pointing to a role for myocardin in the ANP response to PE (Fig. 9C). Similar experiments were performed using MLC-luciferase. As with ANP-luciferase, GATA4, c-Jun + JNK, SRF, and myocardin all activated MLC2 transcription, but only the response to myocardin was inhibited by UTP. As described previously (17Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar), the maximal MLC2 response to myocardin was lower than the ANP response (Figs. 9A and 10A). Myocardin substantially increased PE-induced MLC2 transcription (Fig. 10B). Myocardin has been reported to activate muscle-specific promoters exclusively (17Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). In the current study we confirmed that myocardin did not activate Mb-luciferase or 2xTRE-luciferase constructs. NRVM were transfected with Mb-luciferase or 2xTRE-luciferase, 50 μm PE together with 1 μm propranolol was added, and luciferase activity measured after 20 h. Overexpression of myocardin did not increase transcription from either promoter and did not enhance the activation by PE. In contrast, Mb-luciferase expression was increased by the other transcription factors tested, and PE further enhanced activation (Fig. 11). Thus UTP inhibits PE-induced transcription of ANP and of MLC2, but transcription from myoglobin promoters or from AP-1 elements was not inhibited. UTP selectively inhibited ANP and MLC2 responses to myocardin, and myocardin in turn selectively activates ANP and MLC2 promoter elements. Given that the PE response is enhanced by myocardin, it is possible that the suppression of PE induced ANP and MLC2 transcription by UTP is related to its effect on the muscle-specific transcription enhancer, myocardin. Activation of Gq by appropriate receptor agonists, by Gαq overexpression, or by treatment with the Gq-activating toxin from P. multocida induces hypertrophic growth of NRVM that includes increases in cell size as well as re-expression of fetal genes (8Sabri A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 850-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown II, J.H. D G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both PE and UTP activate Gq-coupled receptors stimulate PLCβ subtypes, transactivate EGFRs, and phosphorylate ERK1/2 (23Arthur J.F. Matkovich S.J. Mitchell C.J. Biden T.J. Woodcock E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37341-37346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Figs. 3 and 4). Although other Gq-coupled receptors have been shown to transactivate EGFR in NRVM (7Thomas W.G. Brandenburger Y. Autelitano D.J. Pham T. Qian H.W. Hannan R.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), this is the first direct demonstration of transactivation by endogenous α1-AR and P2Y receptors. Both agonists also cause substantial increases in cardiomyocyte size (Fig. 1) (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). But, in marked contrast, only PE caused a robust ANP response (Fig. 2), even though our data showed that the ANP response to PE involves Gq and EGFR activation (Fig. 5). Subsequent experiments showed that UTP inhibited ANP responses to PE, consistent with the relative ineffectiveness of UTP as a transcriptional activator of ANP expression (Figs. 2 and 6). We also showed that overexpression of Gαq did not reduce the UTP inhibition; rather UTP inhibited the Gαq activation (Fig. 5). This ruled out competition for Gq as a mechanism of inhibition of PE responses by UTP. Moreover, UTP did not inhibit immediate responses to PE such as EGFR phosphorylation or ERK1/2 activation, as would be expected from competition for available Gq (Fig. 8). Thus, the UTP-inhibited step is subsequent to early signaling responses associated with ANP transcription. Inhibition by UTP was selective for the two cardiac-specific promoters regulating ANP and MLC2 transcription. When experiments were performed using luciferase constructs incorporating AP-1 sites or the myoglobin promoter that includes NFAT-responsive elements, UTP, like PE, was stimulatory (Fig. 7). Furthermore, UTP stimulation of AP-1 elements was additive with rather than inhibitory to the PE response. Thus, the UTP inhibition is selective for particular promoters, apparently those that are cardiac-specific. The finding that UTP selectively inhibited PE responses at ANP and MLC promoters suggested the likelihood of an effect mediated by transcription factors specific for those promoters. Myocardin is a newly described transcription enhancer that acts selectively on ANP and MLC2 promoters (17Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) (Figs. 9, 10, 11). Myocardin associates with SRF and confers muscle specificity on the activity of SRF, which, on its own, is functional in nonmuscle cells. Many of the other transcription factors known to bind the ANP promoter, including GATA4 and c-Jun, also activate promoters that are not muscle-specific (24Molkentin J.D. Lu J.R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar, 25Chang L.F. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we found that UTP treatment caused a selective inhibition of myocardin-induced ANP and MLC2 transcription. Responses to c-Jun, GATA4, or SRF were not inhibited. This myocardin selectivity potentially explains the selective inhibition of PE-induced transcription from ANP and MLC2 but not from myoglobin or AP-1 elements. The mechanism by which myocardin activity is regulated is not currently known, and a role in PE-mediated responses remains to be established. However, there are a number of factors that argue in favor of myocardin as the target of UTP inhibition of PE-induced ANP and MLC2 transcription. First, UTP treatment depressed transcriptional responses to myocardin. Second, PE responses were inhibited only at myocardin-sensitive promoters. Third, the PE response was markedly enhanced by overexpressed myocardin. Taken together these findings suggest that PE activation of ANP and MLC2 promoters involves myocardin, among other factors, and that UTP treatment reduces PE responses by interfering with myocardin functioning at these promoters. However, it must be stressed that direct evidence is lacking and that it is also possible that there are two separate and independent inhibitory actions of UTP one targeting myocardin and the other some other factor acting beyond immediate signaling responses to PE. It is also likely that other muscle-specific factors are involved in the responses described. Cardiomyocytes express a number of different purinergic receptors of which the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptors might be expected to respond robustly to UTP (26Vassort G. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 767-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In acute experiments, responses to UTP were mimicked by ATP (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP enhanced PLC activity and caused EGFR phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation, but because ATP is cytotoxic to cardiomyocytes with prolonged exposure (5Pham T. Morris J. Arthur J. Post G. Brown J. Woodcock E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 287-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it is impossible to evaluate effects on transcriptional responses. Similarly, we found suramin, an antagonist at P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y4 receptors (26Vassort G. Phys. Rev. 2001; 81: 767-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), to be toxic with chronic treatment. Therefore, it has not been possible to define the receptors responsible for the inhibitory action of UTP on ANP and MLv2 transcription. Pathological insults including chronically heightened blood pressure, myocardial infarction, valve disease, and some congenital defects lead to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes (27Schaub M.C. Hefti M.A. Harder B.A. Eppenberger H.M. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 901-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 28Homcy C.J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1890-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In most cases this is associated with increased expression and release of ANP from the ventricular myocytes. Increased plasma ANP would be expected to increase sodium excretion and to cause dilatation of the vasculature, thereby reducing afterload on the heart (29Calderone A. Heart Fail Rev. 2003; 8: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Costello-Boerrigter L.C. Boerrigter G. Burnett Jr., J.C. Med. Clin. North Am. 2003; 87: 475-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study has suggested direct beneficial effects of ANP on the cardiomyocytes themselves. Cardiac targeted knockout of ANP receptor type C lead to a worsened prognosis following pressure overload in vivo (9Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Schneider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Thus, a hypertrophic response that induces cellular growth without increased ANP expression might be expected to be particularly detrimental to the heart (10Molkentin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1275-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is not obvious how UTP would cause sustained myocardial responses in vivo, unless there is substantial local release from the heart under some circumstances. ATP, but not UTP, is released from cardiac sympathetic nerves during stimulation (31Sesti C. Koyama M. Broekman M.J. Marcus A.J. Levi R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 306: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and might cause chronic activation of purinergic receptors under some conditions. It is possible that the cytotoxic effect of ATP, observed in cell culture, is due to degradation products accumulating in the culture medium and that in vivo repeated release and clearance of ATP would allow for sustained growth responses, but this remains to be established. In any case, we have described an inhibition of ANP transcriptional responses by UTP, possibly involving the newly described transcription factor, myocardin. Further studies are needed to establish exactly how myocardin responses are regulated, whether myocardin is involved in α1-AR-mediated responses, and how inhibition is induced by chronic exposure to UTP. Prof. Richard Harvey (Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Sydney) kindly supplied neuregulin as well as plasmids encoding myocardin, SRF, and GATA4.

https://openalex.org/W1988186909,"Microtubules play a central role in coordinating various cellular functions that are orchestrated by their interaction with molecular motors. Anticancer drugs that target microtubule dynamics have been shown to be effective in cancer treatment. However, the effect of microtubule motor-associated molecules on cancer cell proliferation is not clear. Here, we investigated the role of NudC, a nuclear movement protein associated with the microtubule motor dynein, on prostate tumorigenesis. Recombinant adenovirus expressing NudC (Ad-NudC) was used to examine the effects of NudC on the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. Expression of NudC in LNCaP cells inhibited their anchorage-independent growth in a soft agar colony assay. Expression of NudC in DU145 or PC-3 cells inhibited tumor growth in a subcutaneous xenograft model. At the cellular level, expression of NudC in DU145 and PC-3 cells inhibited cell proliferation at 48 h after Ad-NudC infection. FACS analysis of cell cycle distribution showed that 50-60% of Ad-NudC-infected PC-3 cells have a G2/M-phase DNA content compared to about 16-19% in Ad-Luciferase (Ad-Luc)-infected control cells, suggesting that NudC overexpression resulted in aberrant cell cycle progression. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a significant increase in cells with a single enlarged nucleus and cells exhibiting multiple nuclei, along with a concomitant increase in cell size in Ad-NudC-infected cells. These results suggest that NudC overexpression led to a block in cell division of prostate cancer cells, and that Ad-NudC may provide a new anticancer drug approach targeting the function of a microtubule motor-associated protein."
https://openalex.org/W1994119264,"Leukotriene A4 (LTA4) is a chemically unstable triene epoxide product of 5-lipoxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid. Despite this chemical reactivity and its synthesis at the perinuclear membrane, LTA4 is enzymatically converted into the cysteinyl leukotrienes and leukotriene B4. Furthermore, LTA4 participates in transcellular biosynthesis and is thus transferred between cells as an intact molecule.

This protein was determined to be the stabilizing factor present in the cell cytosol responsible for increasing the effective chemical half-life of LTA4. Rat epithelial fatty acid-binding protein (E-FABP) was isolated using partial protein purification and immunoprecipitation. In-gel digestion with trypsin followed by peptide fingerprint analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and sequencing the major tryptic peptide obtained from liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis identified E-FABP in the active fraction. Semi-quantitative Western blot analysis indicated that E-FABP in the cytosolic fraction of RBL-1 cells was present at ∼1–3 pmol/106 cells. E-FABP (9 μm) was tested for its ability to stabilize LTA4, and at 37 °C E-FABP was able to increase the half-life of LTA4 from the previously reported half-life less than 3 s to a half-life of ∼7 min.

Leukotrienes are a family of biologically active metabolites of arachidonic acid known to play important roles in multiple physiological and pathophysiological processes by acting as lipid mediators through specific G protein-coupled receptors (1Yokomizo T.

The biosynthesis of these 20 carbon fatty acids is regulated within cells that express 5-lipoxygenase, the first committed enzyme of the leukotriene cascade. The 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes two separate reactions; the first is abstraction of a hydrogen atom from carbon 7 of arachidonic acid and the insertion of molecular oxygen at carbon 5 to generate 5-(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HpETE). 1The abbreviations used are: HpETE, 5-(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; LTA4, leukotriene A4; LTB4, leukotriene B4; LTC4, leukotriene C4; RBL, rat basophilic leukemia; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; E-FABP, epithelial FABP; A-FABP, adipocyte FABP; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; TOF, time-of-flight; LC, liquid chromatography. The second reaction involves abstraction of a hydrogen atom from carbon 10 of HpETE followed by internal rearrangement of double bonds, loss of the hydroxyl group, and formation of the chemically reactive conjugated triene epoxide, leukotriene A4 (LTA4) (3Shimizu T. Radmark O. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 4Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Gresser M. Young R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 383-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). LTA4 is a substrate for two enzymes that form the biologically active leukotrienes. LTA4 hydrolase converts LTA4 into leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a chemotactic factor for human neutrophils (5Haeggstrom J.Z. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S25-S31Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Leukotriene C4 synthase converts LTA4 into the glutathione adduct leukotriene C4 (LTC4), which is a myotropic agent (6Penrose J.F. Spector J. Baldasaro M. Xu K. Boyce J. Arm J.P. Austen K.F. Lam B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11356-11361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Once LTA4 is formed and released from the active site of 5-lipoxygenase, a competitive nonenzymatic reaction with water can also lead to the hydrolysis of the epoxide in a reaction in buffer measured to have a half-life of less than 30 s at 37 °C (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Morton D.R. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4680-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through formation of a carbocation intermediate (8Borgeat P. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The products of this nonenzymatic hydrolysis reaction include biologically inactive but chemical stable isomers of LTB4 including the Δ6-trans-5,12-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 5,6-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8Borgeat P. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3213-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In neutrophils, 5-lipoxygenase is found in the cytosol (9Rouzer C. Kargman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10980-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in other cell types, including the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell, 5-lipoxygenase is found in the nucleus (10Brock T.G. Paine III, R. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of RBL cells, 5-lipoxygenase translocates to the nuclear envelope, where together with 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (11Dixon R.A.F. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W. Miller D.K. Nature. 1990; 343: 282-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and arachidonic acid, which is released by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (12Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), the biosynthesis of LTA4 takes place. Studies of the fate of LTA4 produced within the human neutrophil revealed that greater than 50% of this lipid generated after cell activation is released to participate in the process of transcellular metabolism (13Sala A. Bolla M. Zarini S. Muller-Peddinghaus R. Folco G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although many of the details of this process are unclear, it is now established that LTA4 produced in the neutrophil can appear within other cell types that express synthetic enzymes for the biologically active leukotrienes. For example, erythrocytes, which express LTA4 hydrolase but do not express 5-lipoxygenase, have been shown to convert LTA4 into LTB4 (14McGee J. Fitzpatrick F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells and platelets, which express LTC4 synthase but have no 5-lipoxygenase, have been shown to convert LTA4 derived from the neutrophil into LTC4 (15Feinmark S.J. Cannon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 264: 16466-16472Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Maclouf J.A. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the chemical instability of LTA4, it is clear that some mechanism must protect LTA4 from exposure to water, preventing the nonenzymatic hydrolysis during transit between cells. Both the chemical instability and the extent of transcellular biosynthesis taking place in multi-cellular compartments suggest that LTA4 is stabilized by binding to an intracellular protein that protects LTA4 from water. Previous work has shown that serum albumin from various species can increase the half-life of LTA4 to more than 20 min at concentrations that are found in plasma (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Morton D.R. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4680-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, intracellular proteins that function to protect LTA4 from hydrolysis have not been identified (17Peters Jr., P. All About Albumin. Academic Press, New York1996: 76-132Google Scholar). The purpose of our study was to critically test for the presence of LTA4 stabilizing proteins within RBL cells and identify the stabilizing proteins. RBL-1 cells were chosen for these studies because this cell line expresses 5-lipoxygenase and therefore is likely to have a protein that functions in lipid stabilization (18Goetze A.M. Fayer L. Bouska L. Bornemeier D. Carter G.W. Prostaglandins. 1985; 29: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, leukotriene biosynthesis has been extensively studied and characterized in these cells (19Jakschik B.A. Kuo C.G. Prostaglandins. 1983; 25: 767-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our findings now identify epithelial fatty acid-binding protein as an important molecule for stabilizing LTA4 in these cells. Materials—LTA4 ethyl ester was a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Mancini at Merck-Frosst Canada (Pointe-Claire, Canada). All other eicosanoids were obtained from the Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). LTA4-free acid was prepared as previously described (20Carrier D.J. Bogri T. Cosentino G.P. Guse I. Rakhit S. Singh K. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1988; 34: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Anti-epithelial fatty acid-binding protein (anti-E-FABP) and anti-adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (anti-A-FABP) antibodies were prepared as previously described (21Hertzel A.V. Bennars-Eiden A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2105-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nonspecific rabbit IgG and triethylamine were purchased from Aldrich. All other solvents and reagents were HPLC grade and were purchased from Fisher. Cytosol Preparation—Rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-1) were cultured at the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). The cells were grown in suspension to a density between 0.85 × 106 and 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in Joklik's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g. The pellet was resuspended and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The final cell pellet was snap frozen and stored at –70 °C until use. Cytosol preparation was performed as previously described (22Zarini S. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11190-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Ammonium sulfate precipitation was performed as previously described (23England S. Seifter S. Deutscher M.P. Guide to Protein Purification. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 285-297Google Scholar) to remove any proteins insoluble at 30% saturation (w/v) or soluble above 75% saturation (w/v). The pellet from this centrifugation was resuspended in a total volume of 2 ml of 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, and injected onto a Superose 12 prep grade column (16 × 30 mm) (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A mixture of known proteins was chromatographed under the same conditions to create a molecular mass calibration curve. The active fractions from the size exclusion chromatography were pooled and exchanged into 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, using a desalting column (Econo-Pac® 10DG disposable desalting column; Bio-Rad). These fractions were injected onto an anion exchange column (Econo-Pac® High Q, 5-ml bed volume; Bio-Rad) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min and a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 25 min. The active fraction in this purification step was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM1 membrane (Amicon stirred ultrafiltration cell; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). In some purifications, the pooled fractions from size exclusion were exchanged into 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0. Some of these samples were delipidated as previously described (24Glatz J.F.C. Veerkamp J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The samples (delipidated or not) were applied to a cation exchange column (Econo-Pac® CM, 5-ml bed volume; Bio-Rad) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min 50 mm NaOAc, pH 5.0, and a gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in 25 min. Western Blots—SDS-PAGE was performed as previously described with a 16% acrylamide gel and a 4% acrylamide stacking gel (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The gel was then transferred to nitrocellulose, and a Western blot was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Bio-Rad; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody), using a 1:10,000 dilution of the anti-E-FABP antibody. The Western blot was quantified by densitometry using Alpha Ease on an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech Co, San Leandro, CA). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of solutions containing LTA4 stabilizing activity were performed by adding anti-E-FABP or anti-A-FABP antibodies or nonspecific rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:1000. The antibody was allowed to incubate with the protein solution overnight at 4 °C; then 50 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was added; and the mixture was allowed to incubate further for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then briefly centrifuged at 12,000 × g to remove antigen-antibody complexes, and the supernatant was examined for LTA4 stabilizing activity. The protein A beads containing immune complexes were boiled in SDS loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE to correlate antigen depletion and loss of LTA4 stabilizing activity. The proteins were visualized using Coomassie Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad). LTA4 Stabilization Assays—To determine chemical half-life, LTA4 (500 ng) was added to 250 μl of buffer or protein solution and incubated at 4 °C. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed at various time points between 2 and 30 min and added to ethanol (100 μl) containing 100 ng of internal standard, which was either 15-oxo-ETE or 20-trifluoro LTA4. These samples were analyzed using either an in-line photo diode array or a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API-3000; PE-Sciex, Thornhill, Canada) as previously described (26Dickinson J.S. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In either case, the log ratio (peak area of LTA4)/(peak area of its internal standard) versus time was plotted, and the half-life was calculated using the slope of the resulting line. Assessment of the stabilization capacity (units of protein activity) was used to follow protein purification. For these assays, LTA4 (100 ng) was added to either buffer or protein fraction (50 μl). Each sample was allowed to incubate at 4 °C for 20 min, and then ethanol (100 μl) containing 15-oxo-ETE (100 ng) was added. The sample was brought to initial HPLC conditions by the addition of 150 μl of 10 mm triethylamine, and the UV absorbance (280 nm) from LTA4 and 15-oxo-ETE was determined at their corresponding retention times. A reversed phase XTerra MS column (2.1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm C18; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) was used at a flow rate of 200 μl/min with a linear gradient using a mobile phase A consisting of 10 mm triethylamine at pH 11 and a mobile phase B consisting of acetonitrile:methanol (65:35 v/v) containing 10 mm triethylamine. The gradient started at 30% B for initial conditions and increased to 80% B in 5 min. Units of protein activity were defined as 10 times the ratio of milli absorbance unit LTA4/milli absorbance unit 15-oxo-ETE after the subtraction of the same ratio measured in buffer in the absence of protein. One complicating factor in these analyses was the lipophilicity of LTA4. Approximately 5% of the LTA4 added to the protein or buffer solutions adhered to the wall of the polypropylene tube (data not shown); this added to the variability of the measurements of stabilizing units. Protein Identification—In-gel tryptic digests were performed using a method previously described (27Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 28Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Henson P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Resulting peptide samples were analyzed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry after being spotted on a MALDI plate and cocrystallized with an equal volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. This plate was then loaded into an Applied Biosystems Q-Star XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The samples were analyzed using a N2 laser intensity of 2.4 μJ and a pulser frequency of 4.993 kHz. The mass spectrometer was operated in enhance mode over the entire mass range (m/z 400–3800). Autolytic trypsin peaks were used as internal standards for the samples; this resulted in mass accuracies of less than 10 ppm. Some peptide samples were also injected onto a 75-μm internal diameter column with a gravity pulled tip containing 7.5 cm of C18 packing (Jupiter 10 μm, 300 Å; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) and eluted using reversed phase solvents consisting of mobile phase solvent A, water containing 0.5% HOAc, and mobile phase solvent B, acetonitrile containing 0.5% HOAc. The gradient started at 5% B and ramped to 85% B in 40 min at a flow rate of 500 ml/min achieved with a passive split from pumps flowing at 0.5 ml/min. The effluent was introduced into a Finnigan LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) using a source voltage of 1.6 kV. The stainless steel capillary held a potential of 38 V, the heated capillary was set at 200 °C, and the tube lens offset was –10 V. The MS/MS experiments were carried out with a scan speed of 3 s and a mass isolation width of 2 Da; the collision energy for these experiments was set at 35% relative collision energy, and the collision gas was helium. Data from both MALDI-TOF and LC/MS/MS experiments were entered into the Mascot search algorithm (www.matrixscience.com) (29Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J.C. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6776) Google Scholar). Initial studies were designed to critically examine the hypothesis that cells involved in LTA4 synthesis contain proteins that stabilize this leukotriene and protect it from spontaneous hydrolysis. Cytosol obtained from RBL-1 cells was incubated with LTA4, and the chemical half-life of LTA4 in this preparation was compared with the chemical half-life in buffer. The experiments were performed at 4 °C because the half-life of LTA4 had been previously shown to be substantially longer at lower temperatures (17Peters Jr., P. All About Albumin. Academic Press, New York1996: 76-132Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, RBL-1 cytosol was able to increase the half-life of LTA4 to 7.5 ± 0.67 min, a 5.4-fold increase over lysis buffer alone (t12=1.4±0.27min). Standardized units of stabilizing activity (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used to monitor the protein preparations through subsequent purification steps. Ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytosolic proteins demonstrated that the activity precipitated between 30 and 75% salt saturation. The number of total activity units found in cytosol decreased when the protein was subjected size exclusion chromatography as shown in Fig. 1 (B and C). However, the specific activity at this stage increased 3.6-fold following size exclusion chromatography. The active fraction eluted from the size exclusion column at a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 10–25 kDa (Fig. 1B). Without delipidation, the active cytosolic component eluted in the flow through from both cation and anion exchange columns (Fig. 1C and Table I) with up to a 23-fold increase in specific activity. When the protein preparations were delipidated prior to cation exchange, the active component bound to the column and eluted with 160–200 mm sodium chloride (Table I) with essentially the same specific activity.Table IPurification of RBL-1 cytosol by size exclusion chromatography and cation exchange chromatographyPurification stepTotal unitsSpecific activityaSpecific activity units correspond to an assessment of LTA4 remaining after 20 min in incubated buffer, normalized to the protein content as measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay.

Open table in a new tab The molecular mass of the stabilizing protein together with its physiochemical behavior on ion exchange and behavior following delipidation were consistent with a known family of low molecular mass proteins known as the fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs). To test whether FABPs accounted for the activity found in the anion exchange flow through, this fraction was subjected to an immunoprecipitation, and the supernatant from the immunoprecipitation was tested for any LTA4 stabilizing activity (Fig. 2). Treatment of the anion exchange flow through with the antibody to E-FABP, followed by precipitation of the antibody complex with protein A-Sepharose, completely abolished the stabilizing activity that was previously found in the anion exchange flow through; the units per milliliter decreased from 56 ± 5 to 1.9 ± 2.5 units/ml. When the partially purified proteins present in the anion exchange flow through fraction were incubated with either nonspecific rabbit IgG or with an antibody to the A-FABP (21Hertzel A.V. Bennars-Eiden A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2105-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the stabilizing activity remained in the supernatant following the precipitation. The pelleted protein A beads from the immunoprecipitation were boiled with SDS loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. This gel was stained (Fig. 3A), and regions covering the entire gel were analyzed by tryptic digestion followed by MALDI-TOF to determine those proteins bound to the E-FABP antibody. The tryptic peptides obtained from bands at 25 and 50 kDa (bands I and II) in lane 2 of the gel (Fig. 3A) were found to contain peptides derived from rabbit IgG. The only protein identified from the gel, other than rabbit antibody and low levels of keratin, was E-FABP (Band III). The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of band III in Fig. 3A is shown in Fig. 3B. All peaks marked with asterisks in Fig. 3B were found to match peptides from E-FABP with an average error of 4 ppm. These peptides provided 69% sequence coverage of the protein. Other ions in the mass spectrum result from the autolytic trypsin fragments (m/z 842.49, 1045.57, and 2211.10, marked with T) and tryptic fragments of keratin (m/z 1307.67, 1475.76, and 1791.76). A separate in-gel tryptic digest of the same gel region was analyzed by electrospray ionization LC/MS/MS, and the resultant spectrum of the HPLC that corresponded to the most abundant MALDI ion at m/z 927.56 was observed as a doubly charged ion (m/z 464.3). Collisional activation of this ion generated a family of product ions consistent with specific peptide cleavages corresponding to y1–y7 for a nonapeptide (Fig. 3C). The most abundant product ions were observed at m/z 529.4 (y5) and m/z 359.2 (y3) (Fig. 3C and Table II). The remaining fragment ion in the y ion series was not seen when the doubly charged peptide was collisionally activated, but this y8 ion (m/z 798.5) was seen in the MS/MS spectrum of the singly charged peptide (data not shown) consistent for the tryptic fragment ELGVGLALR. The other major ions seen in the MALDI spectrum (Fig. 3B) were also observed by LC/MS/MS, and the abundant fragment ions from two of these peptides are listed in Table II.Table IIMost abundant product ions resulting from ESI-LC/MS/MS collisional activation (see “Experimental Procedures”) of major peptides from the tryptic digest of the immunoprecipitated protein with anti-E-FABP antibodyMALDI m/zaIons correspond to the peptides seen in Fig. 3B.ESI ion collisionally activatedMost abundant product ions (peptide fragment)927.55464.4 (+2)529.4 (y5); 359.2 (y3); 381.0 (b4-H2O); 551.6 (b6-H2O)1454.661454.7 (+1)1014.5 (b9); 1177.5 (b10); 1308.6 (b11); 1436.7 ([M + H]+ - H2O)1934.92968.3 (+2)880.5 (y8); 1096.5 (y10); 752.9 (y6); 853.3 (b7)a Ions correspond to the peptides seen in Fig. 3B. Open table in a new tab A semi-quantitative Western blot was used to estimate the amount of E-FABP present in RBL-1 cytosol (Fig. 4). Based upon densitometry, the cytosol contained ∼0.4 ng of E-FABP/μg of total protein corresponding to ∼1–3 pmol/106 RBL-1 cells. For stabilization of LTA4 by E-FABP, the stabilizing properties of purified delipidated E-FABP were examined using LTA4 stability units and the half-life of LTA4. Using a constant concentration of LTA4 (6 μm), E-FABP reached its maximum of 380 ± 15 units/ml at ∼40 μm E-FABP (Fig. 5A). The half-life of LTA4 (1.5–25 μm) in the presence of 9 μm E-FABP reached a maximum half-life of 29 ± 0.7 min with 3 μm LTA4, but higher concentrations of LTA4 had substantially shorter half-lives (Fig. 5B). Separate studies compared the ability of E-FABP to stabilize LTA4 relative to bovine serum albumin at both 4 and 37 °C (Fig. 6). The half-life of LTA4 in buffer alone at 4 °C was 0.6 ± 0.01 min; at 37 °C, the half-life of LTA4 in buffer was too short to measure. As a negative protein control, ovalbumin was found to have no significant stabilizing activity (data not shown). When bovine serum albumin (10 μm) was tested for its ability to stabilize LTA4 at 4 °C, LTA4 had a half-life of 24 ± 1.5 min, and E-FABP (10 μm) stabilized LTA4 to a half-life of 23 ± 2.5 min. At 37 °C, E-FABP stabilized LTA4 to a half-life of 7 ± 0.7 min, whereas bovine serum albumin increased the half-life of LTA4 to 5 ± 0.3 min. Fatty acid-binding proteins are a family of low molecular mass proteins (∼15 kDa) found in the cytosol of most cells (30Storch J. Thumser A.E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 28-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The members of this family have between 20 and 70% sequence identity; however, they all share similar tertiary structures consisting of 10 antiparallel β-strands linked by hydrogen bonds to form a β-barrel (31Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The fatty acid-binding protein family has been studied for its involvement in transport of long chain fatty acids as well as various hydrophobic ligands in a number of different tissues (32Zimmerman A.W. van Moerkerk H.T.B. Veerkamp J.H. Intl. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This protein family has been implicated as a soluble carrier of insoluble lipids found in the cytoplasm. FABPs also have been proposed to facilitate transport of lipids into cells by sequestration of these hydrophobic molecules in the cytosol. Even though the binding properties of these proteins with various ligands have been extensively examined in vitro, there is still some controversy as to their exact physiological role in vivo (33Krieg P. Feil S. Furstenberger G. Bowden G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17362-17369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial studies with crude RBL-1 cell cytosol suggested the presence of a factor that was able to stabilize LTA4 as measured by an increased half-life of the leukotriene in the cytosol, compared with buffer alone (Fig. 1A). The specific activity of this stabilization was increased by greater than 10-fold using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, size exclusion, and anion chromatography and almost 20-fold using size exclusion chromatography in combination with cation exchange chromatography (Fig. 1B and Table I). The physical and molecular properties of this factor including its molecular mass (10–25 kDa) and retention upon cation exchange chromatography after delipidation suggested that it might be a member of the FABP family. Immunoprecipitation of partially purified RBL-1 cytosol (Fig. 2) with antibodies to E-FABP removed all of the LTA4 stabilization activity in this fraction. In contrast, when antibodies to A-FABP were utilized, there was little stabilization of LTA4. E-FABP and A-FABP exhibit ∼50% amino acid identity and have very similar fatty acid binding properties, which would suggest that either E-FABP was uniquely active in LTA4 stabilization or more likely that little if any A-FABP is expressed in RBL-1 cells. Although the antibody to A-FABP cross-reacts with E-FABP protein only slightly (2%), the antibody to E-FABP does not show any measurable cross-reactivity with any other member of the FABP family. Analysis of the antibody-precipitated proteins removed from the purified fraction by the E-FABP antibody led to the identification of rat E-FABP based upon MS analysis of several tryptic peptides (Fig. 3). Epithelial FABP (also called keratinocyte FABP) was first identified in murine skin carcinomas and is normally expressed to high levels in epithelial cells of the skin, tongue, lens, lung, and retina and to lesser levels in adipocytes, macrophages, and mammary tissue. Ligand binding studies have revealed high affinity for oleate and arachidonate but little or no affinity for prostaglandin E2 (34Kane C.D. Coe N.R. Vanlandingham B. Krieg P. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2894-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Palmitic acid binding to E-FABP has been structurally defined by a combination of x-ray crystallography and high field NMR (35Gutierrez-Gonzalez L.H. Ludwig C. Hohoff C. Rademacher M. Hanhoff T.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12229-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The region of the protein in proximity to the C-5 C-6 methylene groups of the bound fatty acid is structurally restricted and excludes crystallographically ordered water. Of particular interest is the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr22 that is 4.6 Å from the C-5 carbon. Assuming that the orientation of bound LTA4 is similar to that of palmitic acid, the Tyr22 -OH would be in close proximity of the bridging epoxide oxygen. Interestingly, Tyr22 is structurally conserved in a number of FABPs, including A-FABP. Recently, E-FABP was also found to covalently bind to 4-hydroxynonenal, suggesting this unique fatty acid-binding protein could play a role in lowering the concentration of some chemically reactive lipid intermediates (37Bennaars-Eiden A. Higgins L. Hertzel A.V. Kapphahn R.J. Ferrington D.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50693-50702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here we present an additional novel function for E-FABP as a binding protein that can stabilize the epoxide intermediate, LTA4, by markedly reducing the nonenzymatic hydrolysis within the RBL cell. Involvement of E-FABP in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway has not been previously described, but this protein could play a critically important role in the ultimate production of the biologically active leukotrienes (LTB4 and LTC4). Biochemical studies of the effect of E-FABP on LTA4 stability revealed a saturable process in prolonging the existence of the conjugated triene when present in aqueous solutions. The concentration of E-FABP estimated in the RBL-1 cells (1–3 pg/106 cells) should extend the half-life of this triene epoxide up to ∼5 min at 37 °C. Within such a time frame it would then be possible for LTA4 to distribute throughout the RBL cell cytosol and reach membrane-bound LTC4 synthase, as well as cytosolic LTA4 hydrolase. Furthermore, this prolonged half-life would be consistent with the ability of LTA4 to participate in transcellular biosynthetic reactions, which involve the transfer of intact LTA4 from the cell of synthesis to a partner cell expressing LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 synthase. Previous studies have examined the binding of different eicosanoids with fatty acid-binding proteins. E-FABP has been shown to bind 5-lipoxygenase products (HpETE and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) with reasonably high affinity (34Kane C.D. Coe N.R. Vanlandingham B. Krieg P. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2894-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, products of cytochrome P-450 metabolism of arachidonic acid, have also been found to be ligands for other FABPs. Recent investigations have shown that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids can be bound to heart FABP and protect the epoxyeicosatrienoic acid from hydrolysis when soluble epoxide hydrolase is added to the buffer (38Widstrom R.L. Norris A.W. Van Der Veer J. Spector A.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 40: 11762-11767Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the fatty acid-binding proteins play an important role in eicosanoid biosynthesis and metabolism. In summary, after purification and immunoprecipitation, a cytosolic protein present in the RBL-1 cell that increased the half-life of LTA4 from less than 3 s in buffer at 37 °C to greater than 7 min was unambiguously identified as the rat keratinocyte lipid-binding protein. Although the role of E-FABP in leukotriene biosynthesis has not been previously recognized, it is clear that it can play a central role in facilitating distribution of the reactive chemical intermediate, LTA4, into cellular compartments where subsequent chemical transformations take place to yield the biologically active leukotrienes, LTC4 and LTB4. It is also possible that such fatty acid-binding proteins are also critically important in the process termed transcellular biosynthesis where LTA4 is transferred from one cell to another.

Thus, unlike the mammalian protein, the primary regulation of dCREB2 may occur at a different step from serine 231 phosphorylation. Although bacterially expressed dCREB2 bound cAMP-response element sites, protein from Drosophila extracts was unable to do so unless treated with phosphatase. Phosphorylation of recombinant protein by casein kinase (CK) I or II, but not calcium-calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase A, inhibited DNA binding. Up to four conserved CK sites likely to be phosphorylated in vivo were responsible for this effect, and these sites were phosphorylated by a kinase present in Drosophila cell extracts that biochemically resembles CKII. We propose that the relative importance of different signaling pathways in regulating CREB activity may differ between Drosophila and mammals. In Drosophila, the dephosphorylation of CK sites appears to be the major regulatory step, while phosphorylation of serine 231 is necessary but secondary.

Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). It is a transcription factor that binds to CRE sites and is involved in adaptive responses to a wide variety of stimuli, including neuronal activity, memory formation, drugs of abuse, growth factors, hormones, and peptide signaling. These responses contribute to its transcriptional role in circadian biology, the stress response, neuritogenesis, developmental plasticity, and memory formation (2Redmond L. Kashani A.H. Ghosh A.

Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Although their protein products are very similar, minor sequence differences exist, and the physiological distinctions between them are not entirely clear. Genetic knock-out studies indicate that these genes probably have similar functions since loss-of-function mutations in individual genes result in compensatory changes in expression of the others (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Schmid W. Gass P. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1098-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Hummler E. Cole T.J. Blendy J.A. Ganss R. Aguzzi A. Schmid W. Beermann F. Schutz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5647-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of CREB genes from many species identifies two regions of the protein that are highly conserved (1Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), a basic region-leucine zipper structural motif involved in dimerization and DNA binding and a 60-amino acid kinase-inducible domain (KID) (Fig. 1). CREB activity is regulated by phosphorylation of sites within the KID. Notably phosphorylation of a protein kinase A (PKA) site at serine 133 (Ser-133) allows CREB to interact with the co-activator CREB-binding protein, which in turn activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase II complexes to CRE-containing promoters and by acetylating histones (8Chrivia J.C.

A variety of other kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase/ribosomal S6 kinase cascade, protein kinase C, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs), have also been shown to target Ser-133 (13West A.E. Chen W.G. Dalva M.B. Dolmetsch R.E. Kornhauser J.M. Shaywitz A.J. Takasu M.A. Tao X. Greenberg M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11024-11031Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Other regulatory sites within the KID include Ser-129 and Ser-142 (14Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III, W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Ser-129 is believed to be a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase 3. Phosphorylation of this site occurs only after phosphorylation of Ser-133 and can function to reduce DNA binding of CREB (15Bullock B.P. Habener J.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3795-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Ser-142 can be phosphorylated by CaMKII and is implicated in either inhibiting CREB activity (17Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) or stimulating CREB-binding protein-independent CREB activation (18Kornhauser J.M. Cowan C.W. Shaywitz A.J. Dolmetsch R.E. Griffith E.C. Hu L.S. Haddad C. Xia Z. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2002; 34: 221-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In addition, serine residues thought to be targets for casein kinases (CKs) are found at residues 108, 111, 114, 117, and 121. The Drosophila CREB homolog, dCREB2, is of particular interest since it is a critical molecule in long term memory formation in flies. Studying its regulation may yield insights to the regulation of memory formation. Similar to CREB from other species, dCREB2 has a conserved KID domain (Fig. 1). Ser-231, which is homologous to the critical mammalian Ser-133 residue, can be phosphorylated by PKA, and a serine to alanine mutation at this site completely abolishes activity (19Yin J.C. Del Vecchio M. Zhou H. Tully T. Cell. 1995; 81: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Mammalian Ser-129 and Ser-142 are also conserved as Thr-227 and Ser-240, respectively. In addition, the CK sites are positionally conserved N-terminal to Ser-133/231 and are similarly surrounded by acidic amino acids (20Yin J.C. Wallach J.S. Wilder E.L. Klingensmith J. Dang D. Perrimon N. Zhou H. Tully T. Quinn W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CKII is a ubiquitous, highly conserved serine/threonine kinase (21Hathaway G.M. Traugh J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1982; 21: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Currently its regulation and precise biological roles are poorly understood, but it is essential for viability of eukaryotes. It has been reported to interact with the basic-leucine zipper domains of several transcription factors, including ATF-1 and CREB (22Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Suzuki F. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3854-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In some cases, phosphorylation by CKII has been reported to regulate binding to DNA. It is proposed that CKII inhibits DNA binding of the c-Jun transcription factor (23Lin A. Frost J. Deng T. Smeal T. al-Alawi N. Kikkawa U. Hunter T. Brenner D. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and enhances the DNA binding properties of CREM (24de Groot R.P. den Hertog J. Vandenheede J.R. Goris J. Sassone-Corsi P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3903-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The CK sites of CREB are phosphorylated during early S phase in a cell cycle-dependent manner, although the role of this phosphorylation has not been elucidated (25Saeki K. Yuo A. Takaku F. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, CKII interacts with and phosphorylates basic-helix-loop-helix proteins (26Trott R.L. Kalive M. Paroush Z. Bidwai A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that a large proportion of dCREB2 Ser-231 exists in a phosphorylated state. This suggested to us that, in flies, an alternate regulatory mechanism might be preferentially utilized. We propose that the CK sites of dCREB2 may provide this mechanism by regulating DNA binding. In support of this model, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the CK sites prevents DNA binding, while dephosphorylation allows dCREB2 to bind. Furthermore we showed that phosphorylation of these sites is likely to occur in vivo and that a kinase that shares similarities to CKII is present in Drosophila extracts and phosphorylates these sites. Regulation of DNA binding through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these sites may be a novel mechanism of controlling CREB activity separate from Ser-133 phosphorylation. Extract Preparation—Drosophila head extracts were made by freezing flies in liquid nitrogen, isolating heads, and crushing them with a pestle. For Western analysis, heads were crushed directly in SDS loading buffer (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) and used at a concentration of 5 μl/head. For extracts used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), crushed heads were extracted by addition of 3 μl/head cold homogenization buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Extracts were centrifuged twice at 14,000 × g to remove debris. An equal volume of 2× HEMG (200 mm KCl, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. Extracts containing 100 mm EDTA were made as above except that the EDTA concentration was raised to 100 mm in all solutions used. For extracts fractionated using phosphocellulose, the 2× HEMG was supplemented with 1 m NaCl to make a final extract concentration of 500 mm NaCl. Schneider-2 (S2) cells were grown and passaged as described previously (28Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Extracts were made by resuspending cells in 3 times their packed cell volume of homogenization buffer and lysing by freeze/thawing in liquid nitrogen three times in rapid succession. Debris were removed from extracts by centrifugation, and an equal volume of 2× HEMG was added. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. For phosphocellulose fractionation of extracts, cellulose phosphate P-11 was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer (Whatman BioSystems Ltd.) and equilibrated in 1× HEMG with 500 mm NaCl. Head extracts were added to the phosphocellulose at a ratio of 100 μl of extract to 50 μl of phosphocellulose and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a rotator. Mixtures were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to separate a supernatant (flow-through) fraction from the pellet fraction. After washing with HEMG containing 500 mm NaCl, the pellet fraction was mixed with 0.5 times the original extract volume of HEMG with 1.5 m NaCl. Mixtures were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then the 1.5 m NaCl solution was collected (elution fraction). Both flow-through and elution fractions were dialyzed against 1× HEMG. Mutagenesis, Plasmid Construction, Purification of Recombinant dCREB2 Protein, and Generation of Transgenic Flies—In vitro oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed on pJY386 (20Yin J.C. Wallach J.S. Wilder E.L. Klingensmith J. Dang D. Perrimon N. Zhou H. Tully T. Quinn W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a cDNA of the dCREB2-b isoform originally isolated from a Drosophila head cDNA library and subcloned into Bluescript pKS+ (Stratagene). The mutations that were made were: S231A (TCG codon changed to GCG), (CK1–4)A, S210A (AGC changed to GCC), S213A (AGT changed to GCT), S215A (TCG changed to GCC), S219A (TCC changed to GCC), and S240A (AGC changed to GCC). All derivatives were sequenced on both strands. These were subcloned into pET30C to express protein in bacteria and into CaSpeR-HS to make transgenic flies expressing the open reading frames under the control of the heat shock promoter. Plasmid names are as follows: pJY1048 = S231A in pBluescript, pJY1060 = S231A in pET30C, pJY1056 = S231A in CaSpeR-HS, pJY1049 = (CK1–4)A in pBluescript, pJY1061 = (CK1–4)A in pET30C, pJY1057 = (CK1–4)A in CaSpeR-HS, pJY1051 = S240A in pBluescript, pJY1062 = S240A in pET30C, and pJY1058 = S240A in CaSpeR-HS. Growth of bacteria, induction, and purification of proteins on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Transgenic flies were produced using standard techniques. Transgenes were induced using a 30-min temperature shift from 25 °C to 37 °C followed by 3 h at 25 °C prior to extract preparation. Kinase and Phosphatase Treatment—CKI, CKII, PKA, CaMKII, and λ protein phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Phosphorylation and phosphatase reactions were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. For gel shift phosphatase treatments, 10 μg of extract or 6 ng of recombinant dCREB2 were dephosphorylated in a total volume of 10 μl using 200 units of phosphatase. Recombinant dCREB2 was phosphorylated using S2 extract by mixing 10 ng of recombinant protein with 20 μg of extract in a total volume of 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm ATP. Mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. For 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibition experiments, DRB was added at the indicated concentrations. EMSAs—Sequences of the 3xCRE double-stranded oligonucleotide probe and the mutated 3xCRE oligonucleotide have been described previously (20Yin J.C. Wallach J.S. Wilder E.L. Klingensmith J. Dang D. Perrimon N. Zhou H. Tully T. Quinn W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5123-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 200 ng of probe were radiolabeled using polynucleotide kinase in the presence of 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Probe (4–5 × 105 cpm) was incubated with 5 μgof Drosophila extract, 4 μg of mouse extract, or 3 ng of recombinant dCREB2 for each gel shift experiment. Incubations were carried out in a volume of 10 μl at room temperature for 1 h in 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.4 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). Mixtures were then run on a 4% acrylamide (acryl:bis = 80:1), Tris-glycine (380 mm glycine, 50 mm Tris base, 2 mm EDTA, 3.6 mm MgCl2, and 1% glycerol) gel, transferred to Whatman No. 3MM paper, and exposed to film. For antibody supershift experiments, 0.5 μl of anti-mouse CREB antibody (New England Biolabs) or anti-dCREB2 antibody (3Belvin M.P. Zhou H. Yin J.C. Neuron. 1999; 22: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were added to each binding reaction. Peptide Analysis—Recombinant dCREB2 was phosphorylated with S2 extract as described above except that the recombinant protein used was between 50 ng and 1 μg, and the ATP concentration was 60 pm cold ATP and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation reactions were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The radiolabeled CREB band, identified by Coomassie staining and exposing the wet gel to film, was excised, and gel slices were extensively washed with 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid and then with 50% methanol before being lyophilized. Slices were then treated with 1 ml of trypsin (75 mg/ml in 50 mm NH4CO3H, pH 8.0) for 20 h at 37 °C. Supernatants from the trypsin digestion were lyophilized, resuspended in 200 μl of H2O, lyophilized, resuspended in 100 μl of 10% acetic acid, 1% pyridine, lyophilized, and finally resuspended in 10 μl of 25% acetonitrile, 7.5% acetic acid, 0.75% pyridine. Samples were applied with phenol red tracking dye to TLC plates and electrophoresed at 400 V at pH 3.5 until the phenol red migrated halfway to the anode. Following electrophoresis, plates were dried and subjected to thin layer chromatography in a solvent of 25% 1-butanol, 7.5% acetic acid, and 37.5% pyridine until the phenol red migrated close to the top of the plate. Plates were dried and exposed to film at –80 °C with intensifying screens or analyzed by PhosphorImager. Denaturing Non-SDS-PAGE—Denaturing non-SDS-polyacrylamide gels were similar to standard SDS gels (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1994Google Scholar) except that SDS was omitted and replaced with 8 m urea in the resolving and stacking gels and sample loading buffer. The concentration of the reducing agent dithiothreitol in sample loading buffer was 100 mm. Ser-231-phosphospecific Antibody—Two peptides were synthesized, one with the sequence H-Cys-Glu-Leu-Thr-Arg-Arg-Pro-Ser-Tyr-Asn-Lys-Ile-Phe-Thr-NH2 and another with the identical sequence but with the serine phosphorylated. The phosphorylated peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using an Imject Immunogen EDC conjugation kit (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer and injected into rabbits using standard techniques (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). To purify rabbit polyclonal serum, both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides were reduced (Reduce-Imm reducing kit, Pierce) and cross-linked to agarose beads in a column (AminoLink immobilization kit, Pierce). Columns were run sequentially, and purified sera consisted of the flow-through of the column containing unphosphorylated peptide and the elution of the column containing the phosphorylated peptide. Most dCREB2 Ser-231 Exists in a Phosphorylated Form—In mammals, CREB activity has been correlated with Ser-133 phosphorylation, and Ser-133-phosphospecific antibody has been used widely to identify tissues or areas where CREB has been activated (30Impey S. Smith D.M. Obrietan K. Donahue R. Wade C. Storm D.R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 595-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 31Obrietan K. Impey S. Smith D. Athos J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17748-17756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We wanted to quantify the total amount of dCREB2 present in fly heads and determine the percentage of this protein that was phosphorylated at Ser-231, the equivalent site to mammalian Ser-133 (Fig. 1). Recombinant dCREB2-b protein (an inhibitory isoform) was purified from bacteria and is referred to as rec-dCREB2-wt. Various dilutions of the rec-dCREB2-wt protein and varying amounts of Drosophila head extracts were analyzed on Western blots using dCREB2-specific monoclonal and Ser-231-phosphospecific antibodies. Fig. 2 shows that our monoclonal antibody had similar affinity for non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated protein and results in linearity of band intensity with protein levels in the range tested. Using this antibody, we estimated that a single Drosophila head contains ∼0.67 ng of dCREB2 protein (based on three to five heads). An equivalent blot, probed with the Ser-231-phosphospecific antibody, demonstrates the specificity of the antibody since 30 ng of non-phosphorylated protein gave no signal, while 2 ng of PKA-phosphorylated protein produced a clear band. Similar to the monoclonal antibody, the band intensity produced by the phosphospecific antibody varied proportionally with rec-dCREB2-wt levels (Fig. 2, lower panel, lanes 1–6). Comparison of band intensities between head extracts and recombinant protein led to an estimate of ∼0.67–0.8 ng of Ser-231-phosphorylated dCREB2/head (based on three to five heads). This result indicates that a large proportion, if not all, of the dCREB2 present in Drosophila heads exists in a Ser-231-phosphorylated state. This is a surprising result since the majority of mammalian CREB seems to exist in a non-phosphorylated and inactive form. Activation of mammalian CREB critically depends upon stimulation of pathways that lead to phosphorylation of Ser-133. Phosphatase Treatment Unmasks dCREB2 DNA Binding Activity—We next wanted to determine whether our identified dCREB2 was able to bind DNA. When extracts were tested for CRE DNA binding using EMSAs, one shifted band was detected (Fig. 3A, lane 2). If the extracts were treated with λ phosphatase prior to the binding reactions, a second, slower migrating band was observed (lane 3). The proteins in both of these complexes bound specifically to CRE sites since excess cold CRE, but not mutated CRE, oligonucleotides competed for binding (lanes 5 and 6). To determine which of these two complexes contains dCREB2, supershift studies were performed using dCREB2 monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, lane 4, antibody was able to supershift only the phosphatase-dependent band. The phosphatase-independent band seemed to be unrelated to dCREB2 and was not studied further. Thus, in Drosophila head extracts, there are at least two CRE-binding protein complexes, but only the phosphatase-dependent one contains dCREB2 protein. The phosphatase dependence of dCREB2 binding was not limited to head extracts since dCREB2 from Drosophila S2 cell extracts behaved identically (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that, in Drosophila, the dCREB2 protein exists in a phosphorylated state that is unable to bind DNA and that binding requires the dephosphorylation of one or more residues. Casein Kinase Treatment Inhibits Recombinant dCREB2 DNA Binding Activity—If Drosophila contain a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates dCREB2 binding activity, then bacterially expressed dCREB2 should be free from this phosphorylation and able to bind DNA. As expected, rec-dCREB2-wt was able to bind CRE sites as assayed using EMSA (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of the protein using CKI or CKII severely inhibited binding (Fig. 4, left panel), while phosphorylation using PKA or CaMKII had only slight or negligible effects. In all cases, the incorporation of phosphate into dCREB2 was verified in parallel experiments using [γ-32P]ATP as a phosphate source (Fig. 7 and data not shown).Fig. 7Peptide analysis of phosphorylated sites on dCREB2. A, the indicated amounts of rec-dCREB2-wt were phosphorylated using S2 extract or CKII in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The position of dCREB2 is marked. B, rec-dCREB2-wt phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP using the indicated kinases or S2 extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as in A. Gel slices containing phosphorylated rec-dCREB2-wt were excised and trypsinized. Resulting peptides were eluted, separated in two dimensions by electrophoresis and chromatography, and analyzed by autoradiography. A peptide phosphorylated by PKA and CaMKII is labeled “A,” and a second peptide/peptides phosphorylated by CKI, CKII, and S2 extract is labeled “B.” C, rec-dCREB2-wt and rec-dCREB2-CK were phosphorylated using S2 extract and subjected to tryptic peptide mapping as in B. The position of peptide “B” is marked. In B and C, all blots were aligned such that electrophoresis proceeded in the horizontal direction with the cathode to the right. Chromatography was performed in the vertical direction proceeding upward. Samples were loaded in an equivalent position on each blot, labeled with an “O” on one blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One trivial explanation for the disappearance of DNA binding subsequent to the addition of CKI or CKII would be proteolysis of rec-dCREB2-wt due to the presence of contaminating proteases in these samples. We demonstrated that this was not the case since addition of excess phosphatase after the kinase reactions restored binding activity (Fig. 4, right panel). This reversal of kinase-mediated inhibition suggests that CKI and CKII exert their effects through phosphorylation. Furthermore the inhibition of binding was dependent on the presence of ATP as a phosphate source during incubation with the kinase (data not shown). Thus we propose that CKI, CKII, and/or another kinase with similar site specificity is present in Drosophila and prevents dCREB2 from binding to CRE sites. Mutating Serines 210, 213, 215, and 219 Prevents Casein Kinase II-mediated Inhibition of DNA Binding—We hypothesized that the conserved CK sites in the KID of dCREB2 might be involved in regulating binding. Thus we mutated a number of different sites on the dCREB2-b isoform, including the CK sites, and tested mutant recombinant protein for DNA binding activity. rec-dCREB2-133 contains a mutation of Ser-231 to Ala. rec-dCREB2-CK contains Ser to Ala substitutions at the four putative CK sites located at residues 210, 213, 215, and 219. rec-dCREB2-142 is dCREB2 with residue 240 mutated to Ala. As shown in Fig. 5, all recombinant proteins bound similarly. However, only the rec-dCREB2-CK protein bound DNA after treatment with CKII. Phosphorylation of serines corresponding to mammalian residues 133 and 142 appear not to be involved in regulating DNA binding. Treatment with excess phosphatase after kinase treatment led to a recovery of DNA binding. Schneider Cell Extracts Contain a Kinase That Inhibits Binding—Incubation of bacterially expressed dCREB2 protein in an S2 extract inhibited DNA binding (Fig. 6, lane 3). However, when rec-dCREB2-CK was incubated, it was still able to bind DNA (lane 4). Subsequent phosphatase treatment restored DNA binding of dCREB2-wt (lanes 5 and 6). These observations indicate that there is an active kinase present in S2 extracts that phosphorylates dCREB2 at the CK sites and inhibits DNA binding. The bands present in Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6, are somewhat darker and broader than the bands present in lanes 1 and 2 (recombinant proteins alone). This broadening is likely due to two separate factors. Phosphatase treatment allows not only recombinant rec-dCREB2-wt to bind but also unmasks binding of endogenous dCREB2 proteins present in S2 extracts (see Fig. 3B). Gel shift species containing recombinant dCREB2 migrated at a position slightly higher than those containing endogenous dCREB2 (see Figs. 2 and 8A), resulting in a darkening and broadening of the shifted band, which now included recombinant dCREB2, endogenous dCREB2, and possibly heterodimers of the two. In addition, phosphatase treatment may have slightly enhanced binding of recombinant dCREB2 (see Fig. 3), suggesting that the recombinant protein may be phosphorylated at unknown sites when"

Previously, biochemical binding, in vivo yeast studies, and structural studies of human methionine aminopeptidase-2 bound to TNP-470 and its analogs fumagillin and ovalicin revealed that these compounds exhibit specificity for MetAP-2 over its family member MetAP-1. To further elucidate the nature of this specificity, we developed a yeast-based screen for human MetAP-2 mutations that confer ovalicin resistance. Of the three resistant alleles, A362T appeared in the majority of clones and was found to be the most resistant to the ovalicin class of inhibitors. Alignment of human MetAP-2 with human MetAP-1, which is naturally ovalicin-resistant, revealed that the analogous residue in MetAP-1 is also a threonine. Mutation of this residue to alanine resulted in an ovalicin-sensitive MetAP-1 allele, demonstrating that an alanine at this position is critical for inhibition by ovalicin. These results provide a molecular explanation for the specificity exhibited by this class of anti-angiogenic agents for MetAP-2 over MetAP-1 and may prove useful in the development of additional MetAP-2-specific therapeutic agents.

Because of the clinical potential of TNP-470, it is of great interest to elucidate the mechanism of action of this compound. The cellular target of fumagillin was purified by natural product affinity chromatography and identified as methionine aminopeptidase-2 (10Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6099-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In subsequent studies, it was found that methionine aminopeptidase-2 is also the binding protein of TNP-470 and ovalicin, another structural analogue of fumagillin (11Griffith E.C. Su Z. Turk B.E. Chen S. Chang Y.H. Wu Z. Biemann K. Liu J.O. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Methionine aminopeptidase-2 is a member of the methionine aminopeptidase family of metal-coordinating proteases whose function is to cleave the N-terminal methionine from nascent proteins. Recently it was shown that manganese is the physiologically relevant cofactor for methionine aminopeptidase-2 (12Wang J. Sheppard G.S. Lou P. Kawai M. Park C. Egan D.A. Schneider A. Bouska J. Lesniewski R. Henkin J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5035-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because cleavage of the N-terminal methionine is a process essential to life for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the methionine aminopeptidases are highly conserved from bacteria to humans (13Chang S.Y.

Methionine aminopeptidases (MetAPs) 1The abbreviation used is: MetAP, methionine aminopeptidase. are divided into two classes, type I and type II (also known as MetAP-1 and MetAP-2, respectively) (15Arfin S.M. Kendall R.L. Hall L. Weaver L.H. Stewart A.E. Matthews B.W. Bradshaw R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7714-7718Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae at least one MetAP is essential for viability, as loss of both MetAPs is lethal (14Li X. Chang Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12357-12361Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Studies on isogenic yeast strains revealed that fumagillin, TNP-470, and ovalicin specifically inhibit yeast MetAP-2 but not yeast MetAP-1 (10Sin N. Meng L. Wang M.Q. Wen J.J. Bornmann W.G.

Biol. 1997; 4: 461-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular basis of MetAP sensitivity to the fumagillin/TNP-470/ovalicin class of angiogenesis inhibitors, a library of mutant human methionine aminopeptidase-2 alleles was generated and screened for ovalicin resistance in a yeast-based system. After screening more than 106 colonies in three independent screens, we found 3 alleles that were verified to be ovalicin-resistant: A362T, Y444C, and H382Y. These results suggest that the determinants of MetAP-2 ovalicin sensitivity lie not only in the ligand binding pocket (such as Y444C) but also may exert some effect from a distance (such as A362T and H382Y). The A362T allele was present in almost 80% of all ovalicin-resistant yeast colonies obtained from the screen and was found to be the most resistant of the three alleles to ovalicin and its analogues fumagillin and TNP-470. Protein sequence alignment revealed that the analogous residue in human MetAP-1 is a threonine, and interestingly, mutation of this residue to alanine conferred ovalicin sensitivity to MetAP-1. Taken together, these findings imply that A362 is critically important to the sensitivity of human MetAP-2 to the ovalicin class of inhibitors, thus providing a molecular explanation for the specificity of the fumagillin class of compounds for MetAP-2 over MetAP-1.

All PCR amplifications described above were done with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) for 35 cycles. Complementation of YMAP2 with Human MetAP-2—Genomic DNA from the W303 map1::HIS3 MATα strain was isolated with lyticase and the Qiagen Genomic Tip prep kit.

Gap Repair and Error-prone PCR—p415GPD with insert human methionine aminopeptidase-2 was cut internally with BsaBI and PstI enzymes to create a gapped vector.

The human methionine aminopeptidase-2 was PCR-amplified with Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in 4 separate reactions in which one of the dNTPs was 40 μm and the remaining three were 200 μm. The reactions were then pooled (24Weisman R. Finkelstein S. Choder M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24736-24742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For the gap repair in each screen, 500 ng of gapped vector was transformed with 2.5 μg of pooled mutagenized human methionine aminopeptidase-2 PCR products (25Muhlrad D. Hunter R. Parker R.

Isolation of Plasmids from Yeast and DNA Sequencing—Human methionine aminopeptidase-2 plasmids were rescued from yeast by the glass bead lysis procedure (26Fink G. Guthrie C. Methods Enzymol.: Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology.Vol. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 322-323Google Scholar). The DNA isolated from the yeast was then transformed into competent DH5α bacteria, and individual colonies were picked and mini-prepped. DNA was sequenced by the Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale. Sequence analysis was performed with DNASTAR Seqman. Dot Titrations and Yeast Quantitation Assay—Yeast colonies were inoculated into minimal medium lacking leucine and grown overnight at 30 °C with shaking. A600 was measured, and the yeast were diluted to 0.200 absorbance units, then serially diluted 10-fold to 0.00002. Using a 1-10-μl multichannel pipettor, 3-μl aliquots of diluted yeast were plated onto extract-peptone-dextrose agar plates with various concentrations of ovalicin, fumagillin, and TNP-470. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 2-7 days and then photographed. In the yeast quantitation assay, 3-μl aliquots of yeast diluted to A600 = 0.200 were plated onto extract-peptone-dextrose agar plates with various concentrations of ovalicin, fumagillin, and TNP-470. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 2-4 days, and the yeast colonies were scraped from the plate and resuspended in 1 ml of double-distilled H2O. The amount of yeast was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 600 nm, and % growth was determined by the following formula.AbsorbanceofyeastgrowninthepresenceofdrugAbsorbanceofyeastgrownintheabsenceofdrug×100(Eq. 1) Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used to PCR amplify the supercoiled double-stranded DNA template plasmid. Primers complementary to opposite strands of the vector were extended using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene) for 18 cycles. The resulting PCR product was digested with DpnI to eliminate parental DNA and transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli.

Sequence Analysis—Protein sequence alignments were performed with the DNAssist 2.0 computer program (DNAssist cc, South Africa). Human Methionine Aminopeptidase-2 Complements the Function of Yeast Methionine Aminopeptidase-2—Because of the nature of gap repair as a method for creating a library of mutant MetAP-2 alleles, it was undesirable to screen yeast MetAP-2 because it preferentially recombines with the yeast genome. It was, therefore, desirable to screen MetAP-2 from a different species. Alignment of human and yeast methionine aminopeptidase-2 reveals that these proteins share a modest 54% amino acid sequence identity and 69% similarity. A demonstration of the functionality of the human MetAP-2 gene in S. cerevisiae was necessary to perform a fruitful screen; therefore, human MetAP-2 was tested for its ability to complement the function of yeast MetAP-2 or YMAP2. Because loss of both MetAPs in yeast is lethal, the overall strategy was to rescue a ΔMAP1ΔMAP2 yeast strain with human MetAP-2. The MetAP null strain, containing the ade2-1 mutation, was constructed and rescued with episomal human MetAP-2 and YMAP2. Growth of the resulting strain under non-selective conditions led to loss of the YMAP2 gene, and surviving yeast were viable due to the presence of functional human MetAP-2. The ade2-1 mutation in the MetAP null strain causes the buildup of adenine precursor, which colors the yeast red. However, the plasmid into which YMAP2 is cloned also contains an ade2-1 suppressor gene and eliminates the red color when present. As shown in Fig. 1, the yeast are either completely red or have sectored, indicating loss of the YMAP2 plasmid and evidence that human MetAP-2 is sufficient for yeast viability in the absence of YMAP1 and YMAP2. Further evidence for the functionality of human MetAP-2 in yeast was provided by its ability to confer a growth advantage to ΔMAP1 yeast in the presence of fumagillin (data not shown). Given that fumagillin, TNP-470, and ovalicin all target MetAP-2, it was important to determine whether these three analogues were equivalently effective in inhibition of yeast growth. Although wild type yeast are resistant to fumagillin, yeast with a deleted MetAP-1 gene (ΔMAP1) cannot grow in the presence of fumagillin. Comparison of the growth of human MetAP-2-overexpressing ΔMAP1 yeast in response to the fumagillin analogues showed that ovalicin was the most potent, followed by fumagillin and TNP-470 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore ovalicin was the inhibitor of choice for the screening procedure. Screening and Discovery of Ovalicin-resistant Mutations of Human Methionine Aminopeptidase-2—To determine the optimal concentration of ovalicin for screening, ΔMAP1 yeast expressing wild type human MetAP-2 were plated in the presence of various ovalicin concentrations. These pilot studies revealed that no colonies grew above 10 nm ovalicin. Mutant alleles of human methionine aminopeptidase-2 were generated by error-prone PCR and co-transformed with gapped p415GPD yeast expression vector into ΔMAP1 yeast to simultaneously create and screen a library of mutant human MetAP-2 alleles. These yeast were then plated directly onto plates of minimal medium lacking leucine with 10 nm ovalicin. Plasmids were rescued from the colonies that grew in the presence of 10 nm ovalicin, and the identities of the alleles was determined by sequencing. As shown in Table I, the screen was performed independently three times, generating greater than 106 colonies. Of the 23 colonies confirmed to be resistant, 18 of them had the A362T mutation, 3 had the Y444C mutation, and 2 had the H382Y mutation. To confirm that these mutations were the cause of ovalicin resistance, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate single point mutations. Yeast expressing these alleles were dot-titrated onto plates containing 20 nm ovalicin. As shown in Fig. 2, there was significant growth of the mutants in comparison with the wild type in the presence of 20 nm ovalicin. To determine whether these alleles were also resistant to other ovalicin analogs, yeast expressing wild type or mutant MetAP-2 alleles were dot-titrated in the presence of fumagillin and TNP-470. All three alleles found in the screen were resistant to TNP-470, but only A362T and H382Y were found to be resistant to fumagillin (Supplemental Fig. 2). To exclude the possibility that these alleles cause hyperproliferation, doubling times were measured for the strains expressing wild type, A362T, Y444C, and H382Y alleles. No significant difference in doubling times was observed (Supplemental Fig. 3).Table ITabulation of screen resultsScreen No.Total123No. colonies screened1055 × 1055 × 1051.1 × 106Total No. OvR colonies/screen69823No. colonies with A362T47718No. colonies with Y444C1113No. colonies with H382Y1102 Open table in a new tab Quantitation of Yeast Growth in the Presence of Ovalicin, Fumagillin, TNP-470—To quantitatively determine the relative resistance of the mutants to wild type human MetAP-2 and to each other, yeast growth in the presence of ovalicin, fumagillin, and TNP-470 was measured spectrophotometrically. Ovalicin was tested at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 nm. Significant growth differences between yeast expressing wild type or mutant MetAP-2 began appearing at 10 nm and were the most dramatic at 20 nm ovalicin (Table II). At this concentration, A362T exhibited ∼63-fold more growth than wild type followed by Y444C at 33.5 and H382Y at 19. Also of note is the fact that A362T is about twice as resistant as Y444C and three times as resistant as H382Y in the presence of 20 nm ovalicin.Table IIQuantitation of growth of yeast expressing mutant MetAP-2 in the presence of ovalicin (Ov), fumagillin (Fg) and TNP-470MetAP-2 allele-Fold growth over wild type at 20 nm Ov-Fold growth over wild type at 50 nm Fg-Fold growth over wild type at 750 nm TNPA362T63.3553.295.33Y444C33.55No growth4.32H382Y19.1818.951.84 Open table in a new tab Fumagillin was tested at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 35, 50, 100, 250, and 500 nm. Growth differences between yeast expressing wild type or mutant MetAP-2 in the presence of fumagillin were observed over a larger range than with ovalicin (between 10 and 500 nm), with the maximal difference occurring at 50 nm. Table II summarizes the growth of strains expressing wild type and mutant human MetAP-2 in the presence of 50 nm fumagillin. A362T exhibits about a 53-fold increase in growth relative to wild type and H382Y displays a 19-fold increase. The A362T allele is more than twice as resistant as H382Y and continues to grow up to concentrations of 500 nm. Consistent with the previous dot titration observations, allele Y444C is not resistant to fumagillin. Finally, TNP-470 was tested at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 750, and 1000 nm. The concentrations are much higher due to our previous observation that TNP-470 is much less potent in arresting growth of S. cerevisiae than either ovalicin or fumagillin. The growth differences between wild type and mutant MetAP-2 are most clear at 750 nm, with A362T displaying greater than 5-fold growth over wild type followed by Y444C at about 4-fold and H382Y at almost 2-fold (Table II). Because of the superior resistance of A362T to ovalicin, fumagillin, and TNP-470 and its abundant appearance in all three screens, this allele warranted further study. Alignment of MetAP-2 protein sequences demonstrated that alanine 362 of human MetAP-2 is completely conserved. In addition, alignment of MetAP-1 and MetAP-2 amino acid sequences revealed that a threonine residue at the corresponding position to A362 is completely conserved in MetAP-1 (Fig. 3). The fact that the A362T ovalicin-resistant allele of MetAP-2 has a threonine at this position led to the hypothesis that this threonine residue in wild type MetAP-1 might be responsible for its lack of ovalicin sensitivity. Generation of an Ovalicin-sensitive Human Methionine Aminopeptidase-1 Allele—Based on sequence analysis with the MetAP-2 amino acid sequences, it was hypothesized that mutation of threonine 334 to alanine might render the MetAP-1 enzyme sensitive to ovalicin. Given that human MetAP-1 complements yeast MAP1 function (27Dummitt B. Fei Y. Chang Y.H. Protein Pept. Lett. 2002; 9: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), wild type and T334A human MetAP-1 were transformed into ΔMAP1 yeast and compared for ovalicin sensitivity. Interestingly, this mutation indeed renders human MetAP-1 sensitive to ovalicin (Fig. 4, panel A). The sensitivity of the T334A allele is not due to reduced in vivo function, as yeast strains expressing wild type and mutant human MetAP-1 do not differ significantly in their doubling times (Supplemental Fig. 4). All of the structural evidence to date suggests that the ovalicin analogue, fumagillin, is not easily accommodated by MetAP-1 due to the narrow specificity pocket (28Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the bulk of the fumagillin hydrocarbon tail would prohibit its entry to the narrow MetAP-1 pocket. To test this hypothesis, yeast expressing wild type human MetAP-1 and T334A MetAP-1 were compared for sensitivity in the presence of fumagillin. Fig. 4, panel B, shows that although wild type MetAP-1 is resistant, T334A retains its sensitive phenotype when grown in the presence of fumagillin. Therefore we conclude that the hydrocarbon tail of fumagillin does not play a role in MetAP-1 resistance. To determine whether the sensitivity of T334A extends to the analog TNP-470, growth of yeast expressing wild type or T334A MetAP-1 was compared in the presence of TNP-470. The T334A allele was also sensitive to TNP-470 (Fig. 4C). To quantitatively determine the relative resistance of wild type and T334A human MetAP-1, growth of yeast expressing these alleles was measured spectrophotometrically. As shown in Table III, yeast expressing the wild type allele of human MetAP-1 are ∼60-fold more resistant to ovalicin and fumagillin than yeast expressing the T334A allele. In the presence of TNP-470 there is 2.5-fold difference in growth between strains expressing wild type and T334A. This is consistent with our previous studies on MetAP-2 alleles in the presence of TNP-470 and its poor efficacy in arresting yeast growth.Table IIIQuantitation of growth of yeast expressing T334A allele of MetAP-1 in the presence of ovalicin, fumagillin, and TNP-470Drug, concentration of maximum effect-Fold decrease in growth relative to wild typeOvalicin, 100 nm59.2Fumagillin, 500 nm58.8TNP-470, 1 μm2.5 Open table in a new tab Although much has been learned about the structure and function of the metal-coordinating and catalytic residues of the MetAPs, the molecular basis for the specificity of the fumagillin class of angiogenesis inhibitors for MetAP-2 has remained elusive. Through the identification and characterization of ovalicin-resistant alleles of MetAP-2, we were able to further study the interaction between ovalicin and MetAP-2 and pinpoint the most critical residues underlying this specificity. The conclusions drawn from these results are strongly supported by 1) the reproducibility of obtaining these mutants among independent screens, 2) the conservation of key residues among MetAPs, and 3) the biological relevance of these mutations due to the fact that they were selected in vivo. The alleles found in this screen offer some interesting insight into the manner in which the ovalicin class of compounds inhibits MetAP-2. According to Liu et al. (28Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) tyrosine 444 of human MetAP-2 provides hydrophobic contacts to fumagillin, which may serve to stabilize the drug in the active site. Although Y444C is resistant to both ovalicin and TNP-470, it was a surprise to discover that Y444C was not resistant to fumagillin. This suggests that although tyrosine 444 is critical to ovalicin and TNP-470 stabilization in the active site, this residue is not critical for fumagillin. It is important to note that this tyrosine is conserved; thus, the provision of such hydrophobic contacts to ovalicin is conserved among MetAP-2 enzymes as well. Our surprise finding that Y444C is not resistant to fumagillin suggests that fumagillin forms critical hydrophobic contacts with residues other than 444. These hydrophobic contacts would most likely occur between MetAP-2 and the long hydrocarbon tail present in fumagillin that is lacking in both ovalicin and TNP-470. In contrast to the insight gained from the Y444C mutation, the mechanism of H382Y ovalicin resistance is elusive. Previously, superimposition of the crystal structures of human MetAP-2 and E. coli MetAP (a Type I MetAP) revealed that His-382 of human MetAP-2 corresponds in space to Tyr-65 of E. coli MetAP (29Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Protein sequence alignment of the type I MetAPs revealed that Tyr-65 of E. coli MetAP corresponds to a phenylalanine in human, yeast, and worm MetAP-1. However, the importance of an imidazole versus a phenyl group at position 382 for ovalicin sensitivity remains unknown. Because of the fact that the A362T mutation occurred in the majority of the resistant colonies isolated in the screen and was the most resistant to ovalicin/fumagillin/TNP-470, this allele was extensively characterized. In the absence of structural determination of the A362T mutant human MetAP-2 protein, the mechanism by which this allele functions is currently speculative. One possibility is that mutation of 362 from an alanine to a larger threonine residue may push histidine 331 into the space where histidine 339 resides after ovalicin binding (28Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and as such could prevent entry of the drug into the binding site. To test this hypothesis we attempted to reverse the ovalicin resistance phenotype of the A362T allele by constructing a double mutant (A362T,H339A) to relieve potential steric hindrance between 339 and 331. Unfortunately we were not able to confirm this model because the double mutant allele was not functional (data not shown), suggesting a critical role for His-339 in catalysis. This finding was supported by Griffith et al. (30Griffith E.C. Su Z. Niwayama S. Ramsay C.A. Chang Y.H. Liu J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15183-15188Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), who found that the H339N mutant allele lost almost all catalytic activity. Another possible explanation for resistance of the A362T mutant is that threonine 362 may simply force histidine 331 directly into the space where ovalicin would reside when bound. Either of these two hypotheses could account for the prevention of ovalicin binding and the lack of inactivation of the peptidase activity of MetAP-2. Given the similarity in enzymatic function of the MetAPs, the specificity for MetAP-2 over MetAP-1 of the fumagillin class of angiogenesis inhibitors is quite remarkable. Previously, in an attempt to explain this specificity, the structures of E. coli MetAP, a type I MetAP (31Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and human MetAP-2 were compared (28Liu S. Widom J. Kemp C.W. Crews C.M. Clardy J. Science. 1998; 282: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). This comparison suggested that the active sites of Type I and Type II MetAPs are very similar except for the fact that the catalytic histidine in E. coli MetAP appears sufficiently distant from fumagillin so as not to form a bond, thus suggesting a reason for the difference in specificity. However, support for the ability of fumagillin to interact with MetAP-1 comes from a study by Lowther et al. (32Lowther W.T. McMillen D.A. Orville A.M. Matthews B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12153-12157Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which showed that fumagillin covalently modifies the active site histidine in E. coli MetAP in vitro, albeit at significantly higher concentrations (2.4-2.7 mm ovalicin or fumagillin) than needed to inhibit the T334A allele of human MetAP-1 (20 nm). A potential application of the discovery of ovalicin-resistant alleles is to answer definitively the question of whether MetAP-2 mediates the cytostatic response of endothelial cells to the fumagillin class of angiogenesis inhibitors. Although there is much evidence to support this hypothesis, it has not been proven conclusively. These resistant alleles may also have the potential to explain differential responses of humans to TNP-470 in clinical trials. Such varied responses may be due to differential progression of the cancer among subjects and possibly also to genetic predisposition. A study of angiogenesis in inbred mouse strains demonstrates that there is angiogenic heterogeneity in mice (33Rohan R.M. Fernandez A. Udagawa T. Yuan J. D'Amato R.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the strains in the study exhibited resistance to TNP-470 in the corneal micropocket assay. If the genetic basis for response to angiogenesis inhibitors is shared by humans, perhaps a resistant allele of MetAP-2 that is functional but blocks drug efficacy (such as A362T) could be responsible in some of the cases that are not responsive to TNP-470 therapy. The discovery of ovalicin-resistant MetAP-2 alleles and an ovalicin-sensitive MetAP-1 allele suggests that the geometry of the active sites of these enzymes is far more similar than had originally been presumed and that, remarkably, this specificity is due to a single amino acid difference between the two enzymes. Based on the mutant phenotypes, sequence alignments, and information obtained from the crystal structures, it appears that an alanine residue at this crucial position is the determining factor for ovalicin interaction and inhibition of the MetAP enzymes. Our work highlights the similarities of the active sites of these enzymes while providing an explanation for their sensitivity to ovalicin in vivo. Determination of the crystal structures of A362T human MetAP-2 and T334A human MetAP-1 would elucidate how these mutations affect the movement of amino acids in the binding pocket in response to ovalicin binding. Such studies would enable structure-based drug development of new MetAP-1 and MetAP-2 inhibitors, which is of considerable interest both from a chemical synthesis perspective (34Kwon J.Y. Jeong H.W.

https://openalex.org/W2151907381,"CD43 or leukosialin is a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein, whose extracellular domain participates in cell adhesiveness and the cytoplasmic tail regulates a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation. CD43 is abundantly expressed on the surface of hematopoietic cells, but CD43 expression is also frequently found in the tumor cells of nonhematopoietic origin. In the early stages of some tumors, the accumulation of tumor suppressor protein p53 has been described. Here, we show that the expression of CD43 causes the induction of functionally active p53 protein. Moreover, we found that the activation of p53 by CD43 is mediated by tumor suppressor protein ARF. The coexpression of CD43 and ARF in ARF-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted in programmed cell death, but that was not the case when CD43 alone was expressed in these cells. These data provide the first evidence of the connection between p53- and CD43-dependent pathways."

For instance, Abs found in myasthenia gravis (reviewed in Ref. 1Vincent A. Nat. Rev.

Hemostasis. 2000; 26: 151-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bind important epitopes of the acetylcholine receptor and Factor VIII, respectively, that interfere with the biological activity of these proteins by a steric hindrance mechanism. Other Abs utilize their constant region to mediate pathogenic effects, but antigen recognition by Ab variable domains is the stimulus initiating these effects, e.g. Ab recognition of erythrocyte antigens stimulates complement activation by the constant region in autoimmune hemolytic anemia and incompatible blood transfusions. Similarly, allergen recognition by IgE bound to receptors for the constant region on the surface of mast cells stimulates their degranulation. In other diseases, the mechanism of Ab pathogenicity is less clear. For example, Abs to nucleic acids in lupus (reviewed in Ref. 3Rekvig O.P. Nossent J.C.

Recently, a novel variable domain mechanism underlying Ab pathogenicity has emerged, viz. the catalytic cleavage of antigens. Hydrolytic catalysts such as Abs to polypeptides (5Paul S. Volle D.J.

Moreover, catalysts are endowed with turnover capability, i.e. a single Ab molecule can hydrolyze multiple antigen molecules, suggesting that such Abs may exert functional effects that are more potent than Abs dependent on stoichiometric antigen recognition. Abs that catalyze the cleavage of VIP have been identified in patients with autoimmune disease (10Bangale Y. Karle S. Planque S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Nishiyama Y. Li L. Kalaga R. Paul S.

Proteolytic Abs to VIP appear to utilize a covalent catalytic mechanism reminiscent of serine proteases. This is suggested by studies in which replacement of the active site Ser residue resulted in the loss of catalytic activity (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol.

These compounds form adducts with the activated nucleophiles of enzymes by virtue of the covalent reactivity of the electrophilic phosphorus atom (reviewed in Ref. 16Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C.

As in the case of ordinary Abs, traditional noncovalent antigen recognition is hypothesized to underlie the specificity of the proteolytic Abs for VIP. Therefore, CRAs of the VIP sequence represent a potentially specific means to target the Abs by virtue of offering a reaction surface that combines covalent binding to the Ab active site with noncovalent binding at neighboring peptide epitope(s). Here we describe the antigen-specific covalent reaction of monoclonal and polyclonal Abs with a synthetic VIP-CRA compound. Despite positioning of the phosphonate group at a single site, Lys20, the covalent reaction resulted in irreversible inhibition of polyclonal Abs that cleave VIP at several peptide bonds located between residues 7 and 22. The results suggest the feasibility of targeted inactivation of individual Ab populations based on their antigenic specificity.

The peptide resin was treated with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane (5 min × 10) to remove the 4-methyltrityl group, and the deprotected amino group of Lys20 was acylated with compound 2 in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone containing 0.1 mmN,N-diisopropylethylamine. The peptide resin was treated with trifluoroacetic acid-ethanedithiol-thioanisole-phenol (90:1:1:8) at room temperature for 2 h. After removing the resin by filtration, diethyl ether was added to the solution to afford a precipitate, which was collected by centrifugation and washed with diethyl ether. The HPLC-purified material (retention time 50.25 min, purity 96% (220 nm); Vydac 214TP C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm); A:B from 90:10 to 60:40 in 60 min (1.0 ml/min)) was characterized by electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry (observed m/z 4071.4 (MH+; calculated MH+ for C185H282N49O49PS2, 4072.0)) and stored as 10 mm solution in Me2SO at -70 °C. Abs—Monoclonal anti-VIP IgG clone c23.5 and control isotypematched IgG clone UPC10 (IgG2a, κ, Sigma) were purified from ascites by affinity chromatography on immobilized protein G-Sepharose (23Paul S.

Polyclonal IgG from the serum of a human subject with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (designated HS-2 in Ref. 24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol.

The recombinant light chain of anti-VIP Ab clone c23.5 (GenBank™ accession number L34775) was expressed in bacterial periplasmic extracts and purified by the binding of the His6 tag to a nickel-affinity column (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All of the Abs were electrophoretically homogeneous. Protein concentrations were determined with Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). CRA Adducts—Covalent binding assays were carried out as described previously (17Paul S. Tramontano A. Gololobov G.

IgG (1 μm) was incubated with compound 1 or 3 (10 μm) in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.137 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CHAPS and 0.1% Me2SO (in compound 3 binding experiments) or 0.1% DMF (in compound 1 binding experiments) at 37 °C. In some experiments, the reaction was conducted in the presence of human plasma collected in EDTA (pooled from eight healthy blood donors; 1% v/v). Aliquots of the reaction mixtures at 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min were boiled in 2% SDS containing 3.3% 2-mercaptoethanol in a water bath (5 min) and then subjected to electrophoresis (4-20% polyacrylamide gels, Bio-Rad). Following electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes (TransBlot, Bio-Rad), biotin-containing adducts were stained with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate and a chemiluminescent substrate kit (Supersignal, Pierce). Band density was expressed in arbitrary area units (AAU) determined using a Fluoro-STM Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad), ensuring that the densities were within the linear response range. Catalysis Assays—Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC (0.2 mm, Peptides International, Louisville, KY) was incubated with Ab (0.8 μm) in 96-well plates in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 0.1 m glycine, pH 8.0, containing 0.6% Me2SO and 0.025% Tween 20 at 37 °C, and the release of AMC was determined by fluorometry (λem 470 nm; λex 360 nm, Cary Eclipse spectrometer, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Preparation and assay of cleavage of [Tyr10-125I]VIP were described previously (24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the CRAs inhibit Abs irreversibly, IgG (2 μm) was incubated (37 °C) with compound 1 or 3 for 16 h in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 0.1 m Gly, pH 8.0, containing 2.5% Me2SO and 0.025% Tween 20. Unreacted compound 1 or 3 was then removed by chromatography of the reaction mixtures (0.2 ml) on protein G columns as described previously (23Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (50 μl of settled gel; washed with 0.8 ml of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4; eluted with 0.2 ml of 0.1 m Gly·HCl, pH 2.7; neutralized with 1 m Tris·HCl, pH 9). 50-μl aliquots of the recovered IgG (and IgG·CRA complexes) were incubated with [Tyr10-125I]VIP (86,000 cpm) for 18 h, and peptide cleavage was determined by measuring the radioactivity soluble in trichloroacetic acid. Control IgG samples were incubated without CRA, chromatographed, and analyzed for VIP-cleaving activity in the same way. VIP-CRA—Important features in design of the VIP-CRA (compound 3 in Fig. 1A) are as follows. (a) Inclusion of the electrophilic phosphonate diester group capable of selective reaction with activated nucleophiles, for example, is found in serine proteases (16Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 423-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). (b) The location of the positively charged amidino group is in proximity to the phosphonate to allow recognition by the model proteolytic IgG clone c23.5, which cleaves peptide bonds preferentially on the C-terminal side of basic amino acids (Arg/Lys) (23Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sun M. Gao Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). (c) The incorporation of these groups is on the side chain of Lys20 in the sequence of VIP. Hapten CRA 1 contains the phosphonate diester and amidino groups but is devoid of the VIP sequence. Location of the covalently reactive moiety at Lys20 is based on observations that the Lys20-Lys21 peptide bond is one of the bonds cleaved by monoclonal Ab clone c23.5 (23Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and polyclonal human IgG preparations containing Abs to VIP (24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide inhibitors of proteases customarily contain the covalently reactive group located within the peptide backbone or at the peptide termini (e.g. Refs. 26Oleksyszyn J. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and 27Sampson N.S. Bartlett P.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2255-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, our purpose was to maximize the opportunity for approach of the phosphonate group within covalent binding distance of the nucleophile contained in diverse Ab active sites. For this reason, the phosphonate group was placed at the side chain of Lys20 using a flexible linker, which allows rotation at several C-C bonds (as opposed to inclusion of the phosphonate within the peptide backbone, which may impose a greater level of conformational constraints on accessibility of this group). VIP-CRA 3 was synthesized by the regioselective on-resin acylation as outlined in Fig. 1B. The VIP sequence was constructed by solid-phase peptide synthesis with standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry with the exception that the 4-methyltrityl group was used for side-chain protection of Lys at position 20 (compound 4a). After selective removal of 4-methyltrityl, peptide resin 4b was acylated with compound 2, which was prepared from diphenyl amino(4-amidinophenyl)-methanephosphonate and disuccinimidyl suberate. The resulting peptide resin 4c was treated with anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid to give compound 3, which was purified with HPLC, yielding a single species with the anticipated mass (m/z, 4071.4; calculated value, 4072.0). Covalent Ab Labeling—Monoclonal Ab c23.5, raised by hyperimmunization with VIP, is characterized by strong recognition of the ground state of VIP (Kd 1.9 nm; Km 0.34 nm) made possible by traditional noncovalent Ab paratope-epitope interactions (23Paul S. Sun M. Mody R. Tewary H.K. Stemmer P. Massey R.J. Gianferrara T. Mehrotra S. Dreyer T. Meldal M. Tramontano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13142-13145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic site of the Ab is located in the light chain subunit and is composed of a serine protease-like catalytic triad (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the covalent binding of this Ab by VIP-CRA 3 and hapten CRA 1. The isotype-matched Ab UPC10 (IgG2a, κ) served as the control to determine background Ab nucleophilic reactivity independent of noncovalent recognition of VIP. The covalent reaction was visualized by boiling the reaction mixtures followed by denaturing SDS-electrophoresis and detection of biotin-containing adducts (Fig. 2A, inset). Accumulation of covalent VIP-CRA 3 adducts with the anti-VIP Ab increased linearly as a function of time 2The CRA-Ab reactions were predicted to follow the second-order rate law, but linear adduct accumulation occurred in the initial stage of the reaction. with the light chain subunit accounting for the majority of the adducts (nominal mass 29 kDa determined by comparison with molecular mass standards). Adducts of VIP-CRA 3 with the control Ab were formed at lower levels. Similarly, hapten CRA 1 reacted with anti-VIP and control Abs slowly compared with the VIP-CRA and there was no preference for covalent binding of the hapten CRA at the light chain subunit. Apparent reaction velocities (Vapp) were obtained from the slopes of linear regression curves fitted to the progress data by least square analysis ([Ab-CRA] = Vapp × t, where [Ab-CRA] represents the intensity of Ab-CRA adduct band in AAU and t is the reaction time). Vapp values are compiled in Table I. For the anti-VIP Ab, Vapp of the VIP-CRA 3 reaction with the light chain was 6.6-fold greater than the heavy chain. Hapten CRA 1Vapp values for the two subunits of this Ab were nearly equivalent. Vapp for the reaction of VIP-CRA with the anti-VIP light chain was 66-fold greater than the corresponding reaction with the control Ab light chain. These observations indicate the selective nucleophilic reactivity of the anti-VIP light chain. Inclusion of VIP devoid of the phosphonate group in the reaction mixture inhibited the formation of VIP-CRA 3 adducts with the anti-VIP light chain (Fig. 2B; inhibition in three repeat experiments, 41.0 ± 7%). It may be concluded that selective covalent binding of VIP-CRA 3 by the anti-VIP Ab is made possible by noncovalent interactions due to the presence of the VIP sequence.Table IInitial velocities (Vapp) for the formation of VIP-CRA 3 and hapten-CRA 1 Ab adducts Vapp values were determined as shown in Fig. 2 legend.

As expected, the predominant VIPCRA 3 adduct appeared at the position of the light chain subunit of the VIPase Ab (Fig. 2C). Little or no reaction of the VIP-CRA with plasma proteins and the control IgG subunits was observed. Similarly, the reaction mixtures of hapten CRA 1 yielded little or no adduct formation with plasma proteins or the exogenously added monoclonal Abs. Faint biotin bands were observed upon prolonged exposure in each of the lanes shown in Fig. 2C at a mass of 67-70 kDa. These bands presumably reflect a low level adduct formation of the hapten-CRA and VIP-CRA with albumin, the major protein present in plasma (see silver-stained electrophoresis lane in Fig. 2C). Covalent reactions of albumin with organophosphorus compounds have been reported previously (28Means G.E. Wu H.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Schwartz M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 124: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), a well established serine hydrolase inhibitor, was previously reported to inhibit catalysis by anti-VIP light chain c23.5 (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this study, DFP inhibited the covalent VIP-CRA binding to the light chain (Fig. 2D), consistent the presence of a serine protease-like binding site(s). Inhibition of Catalytic Activity—The cleavage of the model peptide substrate Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC by the recombinant light chain of anti-VIP Ab c23.5 has been reported previously (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have suggested that the light chain contains a catalytic triad similar to the active site of serine proteases (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, the progress of Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC cleavage by the light chain was measured fluorimetrically by determining AMC generated due to cleavage at the Arg-AMC amide bond. As expected, a linear increase of AMC fluorescence was evident (Fig. 3A). Inclusion of VIP-CRA 3 in the reaction mixture inhibited the reaction in a time-dependent manner. The deviation of the progress curve from linearity in the presence of VIP-CRA suggests an irreversible inhibition mode (30Marangoni A.G. Enzyme Kinetics: A Modern Approach. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar). Inhibitory potency comparisons using VIP-CRA 3 and hapten CRA 1 indicated the superior potency of the former compound (IC50 = 1.5 and 27 μm, respectively; Fig. 3B). The superior potency of VIP-CRA 3 is consistent with the covalent adduct data reported in the preceding section and may be attributed to improved noncovalent recognition of the peptidyl component of VIP-CRA 3. The stoichiometry of the inhibition was determined by titration with limiting amounts of VIP-CRA 3 ([3]/[light chain] ratio = 0.0375-3.75 in Fig. 3C). The x-intercept of the residual activity (%) versus [VIP-CRA 3]/[light chain] plot was 0.89, suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. This finding is consistent with the observed molecular mass of the light chain:VIP-CRA adduct, i.e. 29 kDa (light chain, 25 kDa; VIP-CRA, 4 kDa). Next, we turned to a human polyclonal IgG preparation isolated from a subject with airway disease (designated HS-2 in Ref. 24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of VIP by this preparation has been attributed to IgG autoantibodies based on retention of the activity in Fab fragments, adsorption of the activity by IgG binding reagents, and absence of VIP cleavage by control identically purified human IgG preparations. N-terminal sequencing of VIP fragments generated by this IgG has identified the following scissile bonds: Thr7-Asp8, Arg14-Lys15, Gln16-Met17, Met17-Ala18, Ala18-Val19, Lys20-Lys21, and Lys21-Tyr22 (24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we initially confirmed the ability of the polyclonal IgG preparation to cleave multiple peptide bonds in VIP. Three new radioactive peaks were generated from [Tyr10-125I]VIP by treatment with the IgG (Fig. 4A). The observed radioactive product peaks in Fig. 4A probably represent mixtures of peptide fragments, as the VIP fragments generated by cleavage at the aforestated peptide bonds have previously been noted to elute from the HPLC with similar retention times (24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16128-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether VIP-CRA 3 is an irreversible inhibitor, aliquots of the IgG treated with varying concentrations of this compound (10, 20, 40, and 80 μm) were subjected to affinity chromatography on protein G to remove the unreacted inhibitor followed by assay of the cleavage of [Tyr10-125I]VIP (Fig. 4B). Control IgG was subjected to an identical incubation without VIP-CRA followed by the chromatographic procedure. Dosedependent inhibition of catalytic activity was evident, and near-complete inhibition of catalysis was observed at VIP-CRA concentrations >20 μm. The observed irreversible inhibition suggests that VIP-CRA forms covalent adducts with the polyclonal Abs, similar to its behavior with the monoclonal Ab examined in the preceding section. Selectivity of the VIP-CRA inhibitory effect was confirmed by comparison with hapten CRA 1. As expected, the VIP-CRA inhibited the cleavage of VIP more potently than the hapten CRA (IC50 = 7 and 36 μm, respectively). The following conclusions may be drawn from these data. (a) Functionally coordinated noncovalent and covalent interactions allowed nucleophilic anti-VIP Abs to form specific and covalent adducts with the VIP-CRAs. (b) The VIP-CRA inhibits each of the reactions involving cleavage of VIP at several peptide bonds, indicating its potential as a universal inhibitor of diverse anti-VIP catalytic Abs. The importance of noncovalent Ab paratope-antigen epitope binding in directing the VIP-CRA to the Ab nucleophile is evident from the following observations: lower reactivity of the anti-VIP monoclonal Ab with the hapten CRA devoid of the VIP sequence; limited reactivity of the irrelevant isotype-matched Ab and plasma proteins with the VIP-CRA; and inhibition of the anti-VIP Ab covalent reaction with the VIP-CRA by VIP devoid of the CRA moiety. Recently, CRA derivatives of other polypeptide antigens (human immunodeficiency virus glycoprotein 120 and epidermal growth factor receptor) have also been reported to form covalent adducts with specific Abs directed to these antigens with only minor levels of reactions evident with Abs directed to irrelevant Abs (31Planque S.

Taken together, these considerations open the route toward permanent inhibition of individual Ab subpopulations based on their antigenic specificity. The light chain subunit accounted for most of the covalent reactivity of the anti-VIP monoclonal Ab with the VIP-CRA. Reactivity with the hapten CRA serves as an index of Ab nucleophilicity independent of traditional noncovalent forces responsible for Ab-antigen complexation. Hapten CRA reactivities of the anti-VIP heavy and light chain subunits were comparable, suggesting that differences in intrinsic nucleophilic reactivity do not account for rapid formation of adducts of the light chain with the VIP-CRA. It may be concluded that the light chain nucleophile is in the immediate vicinity of the Ab noncovalent binding site and that the noncovalent binding interactions facilitate covalent binding. This statement is consistent with observations that the purified light chain of this Ab is capable of specifically catalyzing the cleavage of VIP (25Sun M. Gao Q.S. Kirnarskiy L. Rees A. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previously, the purified light and heavy chain subunits of the Ab were reported to bind VIP independently determined by a conventional assay for noncovalent Ab-antigen complexes (Kd for light chain, heavy chain, and intact IgG, respectively, 10.1, 6.8, and 1.9 nm) (33Sun M. Li L. Gao Q.S. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 734-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the light chain, the heavy chain subunit appears to contribute noncovalent binding energy for Ab complexation with VIP but the heavy chain nucleophile does not seem to be sufficiently in register with the phosphonate group of the VIP-CRA to participate in the covalent reaction. Additional evidence for irreversible and specific Ab recognition by the VIP-CRA is available from the catalysis assays. VIP-CRA adducts of the Abs obtained following the removal of unreacted VIP did not display catalytic activity. Catalytic cleavage of Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC by the recombinant light chain of the monoclonal Ab has been documented previously (15Gao Q.S. Sun M. Rees A.R. Paul S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This reaction is characterized by 57.5-fold higher Km than the cleavage of VIP by the light chain and is attributed to cross-reactivity of the catalytic site with peptide substrates devoid of an antigenic epitope capable of participating in high affinity noncovalent binding. Pro-Phe-Arg-AMC cleavage by the light chain was inhibited more potently by the VIP-CRA than the hapten CRA. Similarly, the cleavage of VIP by polyclonal human autoantibodies to VIP was inhibited more potently by the VIP-CRA than the hapten-CRA. Ab diversity poses an interesting challenge in achieving antigen-specific covalent inactivation of pathogenic Abs. Structural differences in the variable domains underlies Ab specificity for individual antigenic epitopes, and even Abs to small molecules presenting a limited surface area can contain structurally distinct binding sites (e.g. Refs. 34Kaartinen M. Pelkonen J. Makela O. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 35Mitchell T.J. Reilly T.M. Pept. Res. 1990; 3: 277-281PubMed Google Scholar). Catalytic IgG preparations from patients with autoimmune disease cleave several backbone bonds in polypeptide (7Lacroix-Desmazes S. Moreau A. Sooryanarayana Bonnemain C. Stieltjes N. Pashov A. Sultan Y. Hoebeke J. Kazatchkine M.D. Kaveri S.V. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1044-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Paul S. Mei S. Mody B. Eklund S.H. Beach C.M. Massey R.J. Hamel F. J.

Science. 1992; 256: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) antigens. This may be due to the presence of multiple Ab species in polyclonal IgG preparations, each with a distinct scissile bond specificity. We have suggested previously that the nucleophiles enjoy some measure of mobility within Ab active sites that is not subject to restriction when noncovalent binding of Abs and antigens takes place (31Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Paul S. Planque S.

To the extent that this hypothesis is valid, Abs with differing peptide bond specificity could react covalently with the VIP-CRA even if the phosphonate group is located somewhat imprecisely in the antigenic epitope. In this study, the placement of the phosphonate on the Lys20 side chain (as opposed to the peptide backbone) and inclusion of a flexible linker represent attempts to expand further the conformational space available for the covalent reaction. Complete inhibition of catalytic hydrolysis of VIP by polyclonal Abs that cleave several bonds between VIP residues 7 and 22 by the VIP-CRA was evident. Therefore, promising means to obtain antigen-specific covalent inhibition of diverse Abs include the exploitation of intrinsic conformational properties of Ab catalytic sites and the provision of enhanced access to the phosphonate group by manipulating the linker structure. In comparison, if Ab antigen binding is conceived as a rigid body interaction involving inflexible surface contacts, covalent inhibitor design must entail close topographical simulation of the transition state of each scissile bond and individual inhibitors must be developed to effectively inhibit different catalytic Abs. The importance of evaluating conformational factors in inhibitor design is supported by previous reports suggesting a split-site model of catalysis (31Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Paul S. Planque S. Zhou Y.X. Taguchi H. Bhatia G. Karle S.

As noted previously, catalytic Abs are proposed to contribute in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. Specific covalent inhibitors represent a novel means to help define the precise functional effects of the Abs. Such inhibitors may serve as prototypes for the development of therapeutic agents capable of ameliorating harmful Ab effects. In addition to inactivation of secreted Abs, reagents such as the VIP-CRA may be useful in targeting antigen-specific B cells. The feasibility of this goal is indicated by evidence that CRAs bind covalently to Abs expressed on the surface of B cells as components of the B cell receptor (36Planque S. Bangale Y. Song X.T. Karle S. Taguchi H. Poindexter B. Bick R. Edmundson A. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; (January 15)10.1074/jbc.M312152200Google Scholar). Ab nucleophilicity may be viewed as an indication of their competence in completing the first step in covalent catalysis, i.e. formation of an acyl-Ab reaction intermediate. This is supported by observations that the magnitude of Ab nucleophilic reactivity is correlated with their proteolytic activity (31Planque S. Taguchi H. Burr G. Bhatia G. Karle S. Zhou Y.X. Nishiyama Y. Paul S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that noncatalytic Abs also contain nucleophiles but are unable to facilitate steps in the catalytic cycle following covalent attack on the antigen, viz. water attack on the acyl-Ab intermediate and product release (31Planque S.

Regardless of the physiological functions of nucleophiles expressed by noncatalytic Abs, their presence may allow CRA targeting of Ab populations with established pathogenic roles, e.g. anti-factor VIII Abs in hemophilia.
