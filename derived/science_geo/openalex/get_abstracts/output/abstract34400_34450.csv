https://openalex.org/W2020453274,"The myelin sheath is a multilayered membrane, unique to the nervous system, which functions as an insulator to increase greatly the velocity of axonal impulse conduction. We have used the techniques of differential screening and hybrid selection to identify a cDNA clone encoding the Schwann cell glycoprotein P0, the major structural protein of the peripheral myelin sheath. The sequence of this protein, deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA, indicates that P0 is an integral membrane protein containing a single membrane-spanning region, a large hydrophobic extracellular domain, and a smaller basic intracellular domain. The structure of the protein suggests that each of these domains plays an essential role in generating the highly ordered structure of the myelin sheath. Furthermore, we find that the induction of P0 mRNA coincides with the initiation of myelin formation, and we propose a model in which the glycoprotein serves as a molecular guidepost for this process."

https://openalex.org/W1979482491,"Single filaments, dissociated from the extruded axoplasm of the squid giant axon and visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy, transport organelles bidirectionally. Organelles moving in the same or opposite directions along the same filament can pass each other without colliding, indicating that each transport filament has several tracks for organelle movement. In order to characterize transport filaments, organelle movements were first examined by video microscopy, and then the same filaments were examined by electron microscopy after rapid-freezing, freeze-drying, and rotary-shadowing. Transport filaments that supported bidirectional movement of organelles are 22 nm to 27 nm in diameter and have a substructure indicative of a single microtubule. Immunofluorescence showed that virtually all transport filaments contain tubulin. These results show that single microtubules can serve as a substratum for organelle movement, and suggest that an interaction between organelles and microtubules is the basis of fast axonal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2031316544,"A reconstituted system for examining directed organelle movements along purified microtubules has been developed. Axoplasm from the squid giant axon was separated into soluble supernatant and organelle-enriched fractions. Movement of axoplasmic organelles along MAP-free microtubules occurred consistently only after addition of axoplasmic supernatant and ATP. The velocity of such organelle movement (1.6μ/sec) was the same as in dissociated axoplasm. The axoplasmic supernatant also supported movement of microtubules along a glass surface and movement of carboxylated latex beads along microtubules at 0.5 μ/sec. The direction of microtubule movement on glass was opposite to that of organelle and bead movement on microtubules. The factors supporting movements of microtubules, beads, and organelles were sensitive to heat, trypsin, AMP-PNP and 100 μM vanadate. All of these movements may be driven by a single, soluble ATPase that binds reversibly to organelles, beads, or glass and generates a translocating force on a microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W2054320393,"Three monoclonal antibodies selected for their recognition of parts of the T3-T cell receptor complex on human T lymphocytes were found to induce an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) in the T cell leukemia line HPB-ALL as measured by Quin2 fluorescence. These reagents are directed against T3 (OKT3), a nonvariable T3-associated structure (WT-31) and the variable region of the T3-associated antigen receptor (T40/25) of this cell line. The rise in Ca2+i was dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, occurred within 30 sec of stimulation, and was sustained for at least 10 min. Fab fragments of OKT3 also caused a rapid increase in Ca2+i, indicating that cross-linking is not necessary to induce a Ca2+ response. Alterations in plasma membrane potential and La3+ blocked the Ca2+ influx induced by OKT3 and T40/25. These data suggest that the T3-T cell receptor complex of human T lymphocytes may be an antigen-regulated Ca2+ channel."

https://openalex.org/W2028704064,"Cytoplasmic filaments, separated from the axoplasm of the squid giant axon and visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy, support the directed movement of organelles in the presence of ATP. All organelles, regardless of size, move continuously along isolated transport filaments at 2.2 +/- 0.2 micron/sec. In the intact axoplasm, however, movements of the larger organelles are slow and saltatory. These movements may reflect a resistance to movement imposed by the intact axoplasm. The uniform rate of all organelles along isolated transport filaments suggests that a single type of molecular motor powers fast axonal transport. Organelles can attach to and move along more than one filament at a time, suggesting that organelles have multiple binding sites for this motor."

https://openalex.org/W2114396107,"A transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking process characteristic of keratinocytes leads to the formation of the insoluble corneocyte envelope. The essentials of this process take place in vitro in a reconstituted system derived from subcellular fractions. A particulate fraction containing membrane-bound envelope precursor proteins and the enzyme transglutaminase is combined with cytosolic proteins; when the enzyme is activated by Ca++, cytosolic proteins are removed from solution and cross-linked to particulate proteins. This interaction is cell-type-specific, since particulates derived from fibroblasts and also containing transglutaminase activity cannot substitute for those of keratinocytes. Involucrin, a cytosolic protein known to be a precursor of the envelope, is more efficiently cross-linked than other cytosolic proteins. The cross-linking of proteins of the particulate fraction (membrane proteins) is promoted by the presence of involucrin."

https://openalex.org/W2015826666,"Replication of ColE1-type plasmids is known to be regulated by a plasmid-specific RNA (RNA I), whose binding to the transcript (RNA II) from the primer promoter results in inhibition of formation of the primer for DNA replication. In this paper, it is shown that binding of RNA I to the homologous RNA II is inhibited by an RNA I specified by a plasmid of different compatibility. The inhibition is caused by the reversible interaction of RNA II with the heterologous RNA I, which competes with reversible interaction of the two homologous RNAs at a step preceding their stable binding. As predicted from these results, the copy numbers of both ColE1 and RSF1030 are increased when both plasmids are present in the same cell. The Rom protein enhances the reversible interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2040230707,"We previously reported that silent muscle genes in fibroblasts could be activated following fusion with muscle cells to form heterokaryons. This activation did not require changes in chromatin structure involving significant DNA synthesis. We report here that muscle gene activation was never observed when HeLa cells were used as the nonmuscle fusion partner. However, if HeLa cells were treated with 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) prior to fusion, muscle gene expression was induced in the heterokaryons. The genes for both an early (5.1H11 cell surface antigen) and a late (MM-creatine kinase) muscle function were activated, but were frequently not coordinately expressed. These results suggest that the expression of two muscle genes, which is usually sequential, is not interdependent. Furthermore, changes induced by 5-aza-CR, presumably in the level of DNA methylation, are required for muscle genes in HeLa cells to be expressed in response to putative trans-acting regulatory factor(s) present in muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1987215843,"Exocytosis is initiated by the receptor-mediated influx of calcium that results in fusion of the secretory vesicle with the plasma membrane. We examined the possibility that calcium-dependent exocytosis in mast cells and adrenal chromaffin cells requires metalloendoprotease activity. Metalloendoprotease inhibitors and dipeptide substrates block exocytosis in these cells with the same specificity and dose dependency as that with which they interact with metalloendoproteases. Metalloendoprotease activity is identified in these cells with fluorogenic synthetic substrates, which also blocked exocytosis. Metalloendoprotease activity is highest in the plasma membrane of chromaffin cells. The metalloendoprotease appears to be required in exocytosis at a step dependent on or after calcium entry, since exocytosis initiated by direct calcium introduction in both mast cells and chromaffin cells is blocked by metalloendoprotease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1573680303,"A Drosophila melanogaster cDNA clone was isolated based on its more intense hybridization to RNA sequences from copper-fed larvae than from control larval RNA. This clone showed strong hybridization to mouse metallothionein I cDNA at reduced stringency. Its nucleotide sequence includes an open reading segment which codes for a 40-amino acid protein; this protein is identified as metallothionein based on its similarity to the amino-terminal portion of mammalian and crab metalloproteins. The 10 cysteine residues present occur in five pairs of near vicinal cysteines (Cys-X-Cys). This cDNA sequence hybridized to a 400-nucleotide polyadenylated RNA whose presence in the cells of the alimentary canal of larvae was stimulated by ingestion of cadmium or copper; in other tissues this RNA was present at much lower levels. Mercury, silver, and zinc induced metallothionein to a lesser extent. The level of metallothionein RNA increased very soon after the initiation of metal treatment and reached a maximum after approximately 36 h."
https://openalex.org/W1557473640,"The path and synchrony of intracellular transport of 12 secretory proteins of the guinea pig exocrine pancreas have been studied in pulse-chase amino acid labeling experiments by quantitative analysis of the individual proteins recovered in subcellular fractions and extracellular samples. Protein fractionation was accomplished by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-gel electrophoresis. Use of a double-label protocol allowed correction of the data on a protein-by-protein basis for leakage and adsorption artifacts which accompany tissue homogenization. All the labeled secretory (pro)enzymes, including their isoenzymic forms, were recovered in rough microsomal, Golgi-enriched and granule fractions during their transport to the cell surface. However, major asynchrony was observed at four levels: exit from the rough endoplasmic reticulum; transit through the Golgi complex; entry into granules; and discharge from the cell. Rapid transport rates were observed for trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen 2, procarboxypeptidase A2, and lipase 2. Slow transport rates were observed for amylase and procarboxypeptidase B. In the presence of carbamylcholine or cholecystokinin stimulation, the times required for 40% discharge of labeled chymotrypsinogen 2, trypsinogen, amylase, and procarboxypeptidase B were 98, 102, 148, and 180 min, respectively. Transport rates did not correlate with isoelectric point, molecular weight, or the presence of carbohydrate. These data suggest that interactions occur within the rough endoplasmic reticulum, either between secretory (nonglyco)-proteins themselves or between such proteins and the cisternal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1577788703,"Two species of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors in human placenta have been delineated on the basis of their immunoreactivity with an autoantiserum (B-2) to the insulin receptor. When all the IGF-I binding sites in solubilized human placenta were assayed by polyethylene glycol precipitation, a curvilinear Scatchard plot was obtained which could be resolved into two single classes of binding sites: one immunoprecipitable by B-2 IgG and the other, nonimmunoprecipitable. The B-2 reactive sites bound IGF-I with lower affinity (Kd = 7.1 X 10(-10) M) than the B-2 nonreactive sites (Kd = 2.1 X 10(-10) M) and cross-reacted more readily with insulin, the IGF-I/insulin-binding potencies being congruent to 120 and congruent to 1100, respectively. Both receptor subtypes bound IGF-I with congruent to 30-fold higher affinity than multiplication-stimulating activity, and, after affinity cross-linking with 125I-IGF-I, migrated as specific reduced bands of Mr = 138,000 during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The subunit sizes of the B-2 reactive IGF-I receptor were similar to those of the insulin receptor. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-labeled receptors immunoprecipitated by autoantiserum B-2 or autoantiserum B-10 (which recognizes only insulin receptors) revealed, in both cases, specific reduced bands of Mr = 130,000 and 90,000; the same bands were also seen after sequential precipitation with B-10 and B-2 antisera to enrich the proportion of IGF-I receptors recovered. The presence of two distinct binding and immunoreactive species of IGF-I receptors in human placenta raises the possibility that cell- or tissue-specific isotypes of the IGF-I receptor could mediate the different biological actions of IGF-I."
https://openalex.org/W1600304436,"Loading isolated rat hepatocytes with high concentrations of the fluorescent Ca2+-chelator quin-2 in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ decreases by about 3-fold the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). In these low [Ca2+]i cells, the initial 45Ca2+ uptake rate, assumed to represent the Ca2+ influx, is stimulated to a level close to that promoted by maximal doses of vasopressin and angiotensin II in control cells. The subsequent addition of Ca2+ to the quin-2-loaded hepatocytes results in a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i and a return of Ca2+ influx towards the basal level usually observed in nonloaded cells. This indicates that the Ca2+ influx is dependent on [Ca2+]i but not on the quin-2 load itself. In the low [Ca2+]i cells, both the apparent Km and the apparent Vmax of the Ca2+ influx are increased as compared to the controls, indicating that the properties of the channels activated by lowering [Ca2+]i are apparently identical to those initiated by the hormones (Mauger, J.-P., Poggioli, J., Guesdon, F., and Claret, M. (1984) Biochem. J. 221, 121-127). It is proposed that in the isolated rat hepatocytes there is an inverse relationship between the Ca2+ influx and [Ca2+]i. Under resting conditions, [Ca2+]i might be high enough to partially inhibit the Ca2+ influx via a Ca2+ binding to an inhibitory site presumably located at the inner membrane surface. The role of the site in the hormonal action is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1526091223,"The total collagen gene expression as well as the specific expression of two sequenced Caenorhabditis elegans collagen genes, col-1 and col-2, has been investigated. Northern blots of RNA isolated from animals at different developmental stages were probed under conditions that allow cross-hybridization of all collagen sequences. The majority of hybridization is to transcripts of 1.1-1.4 kilobases (kb) in length, with weak hybridization to some larger transcripts. Different size patterns, within the 1.1-1.4-kb ranges, are seen in RNAs from different developmental stages. Gene-specific probes were produced from the C. elegans collagen genes col-1 and col-2, and each was shown to hybridize to a single size transcript in the 1.1-1.4-kb region. The col-1 transcript was found in all the developmental stages examined, but its abundance varied between stages. The col-2 transcript was detected only in a single developmental stage, during formation of the dauer larvae. The 5' and the 3' ends of the col-1 and col-2 transcripts were determined by S1 nuclease digestion experiments. Both genes have the common TATA and CAAT box sequences preceding the 5' end of their transcripts and there is strong sequence homology in their 5' untranslated regions. Multiple copies of an eight-nucleotide repeat sequence were found upstream from both col-1 and col-2."
https://openalex.org/W1492178396,"The nearly homogeneous 9 S DNA polymerase alpha from calf thymus contains a primase activity that allows priming of DNA synthesis on single-stranded templates in the presence of ribonucleoside triphosphates. Both on synthetic and natural single-stranded templates, RNA primers of 8-15 nucleotides in length are formed. In the absence of dNTPs, primers of some hundred nucleotides in length are observable. ATP and/or GTP are required for the priming reaction. UTP and CTP cannot initiate the RNA synthesis. M13 single-stranded DNA can be converted to the nicked double helical form upon primase-primed replication by the 9 S enzyme. Priming occurs mostly at specific sites on the M13 genome and replication products of up to 6000 nucleotides in length are formed. In the presence of the single-stranded DNA binding protein from Escherichia coli, specificity of priming is strongly increased. The primase is inhibited by salt and actinomycin; it is insensitive to alpha-amanitin and N-ethylmaleimide. Due to the strong complex formation between DNA polymerase and primase, it has not been possible to separate the two activities of the multisubunit 9 S enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1499080952,"Three mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for human apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and one specific for human apo-A-II were characterized with respect to their binding of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in solution. The apo-A-II-specific antibody bound 85% of 125I-HDL and 100% of soluble 125I-apo-A-II. However, none of the apo-A-I-specific antibodies bound greater than 60% of either HDL or soluble apo-A-I. Technical issues such as limiting amounts of antibody or antigen, radioiodination of the ligands, unavailability of the epitopes for reaction with antibody, selective binding of apo-A-I isoforms, and individual allotypic differences in apo-A-I were not responsible for the observed incomplete binding of all HDL and apo-A-I. The results suggested the existence of intrinsic immunochemical heterogeneity of apo-A-I both as organized on HDL as well as in free apo-A-I in solution. The validity of this observed heterogeneity was supported by demonstrating that (i) increased binding of HDL occurred when each of the apo-A-I antibodies was combined to form an oligoclonal antibody mixture, and (ii) 100% binding of HDL occurred when two apo-A-I antibodies were combined with the single apo-A-II antibody. To understand the basis for the heterogeneity of expression of apo-A-I epitopes on HDL, two hypotheses were examined. The first hypothesis that these apo-A-I antibodies distinguished apo-A-I molecules from different synthetic sources was not substantiated. Two of the antibodies bound epitopes on apo-A-I molecules in both thoracic duct lymph as an enriched source of intestinal HDL and the culture supernatants of the hepatic cell line Hep G2 as a source of hepatic HDL. The second hypothesis that the antibodies identified differences in the expression of apo-A-I on HDL subpopulations that were distinguished on the basis of size or net particle charge, i.e. organizational heterogeneity, appeared to provide the best available explanation for the immunochemical heterogeneity of apo-A-I in HDL. Relative differences in the expression of three distinct apo-A-I epitopes were demonstrated in HDL subpopulations obtained by either density gradient ultracentrifugation or chromatofocusing. In light of these studies, we conclude that there is intrinsic heterogeneity in the expression of intramolecular loci representing the apo-A-I epitopes identified by our monoclonal antibodies. Such heterogeneity must be considered in analysis of the biology and physiology of apo-A-I and lipoprotein particles bearing this chain."
https://openalex.org/W1534548422,"To study regulation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH)-responsive adenylate cyclase of osteoblast-like cells by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), cAMP levels and adenylate cyclase activity were assayed in the hormone-responsive ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cell line. Treatment of cells with 1,25(OH)2D3: alone markedly attenuated the cAMP response to subsequent PTH; decreased adenylate cyclase stimulated by PTH; and completely antagonized the positive regulatory effects of cell treatment with glucocorticosteroid (GC) on these responses to PTH. Sterol receptor mediation was indicated by specificity for the 1,25(OH)2D metabolite and high sensitivity (half-maximal attenuation at 7 X 10(-11) M). The effects of 1,25(OH)2D and GC were primarily on the maximal activity of adenylate cyclase and not on sensitivity to Mg2+, guanine nucleotide, or PTH. GC augmentation of ROS 17/2.8 cell cAMP accumulation was also seen with another receptor agonist (beta-adrenergic), cholera toxin or forskolin; 1,25(OH)2D antagonized all these GC effects. Opposing effects of GC and 1,25(OH)2D were seen as well on activation of the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (Ns) by guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate and F- and on activation of the catalyst (C) by Mn2+. In contrast, with the activators other than PTH, cell treatment with 1,25(OH)2D in the absence of GC produced only minor attenuation of cAMP accumulation and no effect on adenylate cyclase activities. The data suggest that GC acts strongly on or near the PTH receptor-Ns complex in ROS 17/2.8 and to a lesser degree on the Ns-C interaction. Direct GC enhancement of C could not be concluded because of the influence of Ns on forskolin action and present data that Mn2+ does not uncouple Ns from C in this system. A GC effect on membrane structure or composition, as seen in other cell types, could explain these changes in adenylate cyclase function without the need to postulate multiple mechanisms. The data dissociate two 1,25(OH)2D effects, direct attenuation of activation of Ns via the PTH receptor and interference with the as yet undefined mechanism(s) of GC augmentation. These may represent dissimilar pathways of 1,25(OH)2D action on osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1596686502,"A triantennary galactose-terminated cholesterol derivative, N-(tris(beta-D-galactopyranosyloxymethyl) methyl)-N alpha-(4-(5-cholesten-3 beta-yloxy)succinyl)glycinamide (Tris-Gal-Chol), which dissolves easily in water, was added to human low density lipoproteins (LDL) in varying quantities. Upon addition to LDL, Tris-Gal-Chol was immediately incorporated, and after intravenous injection into rats, the iodine-labeled apolipoprotein B radioactivity was readily associated with the liver. The incorporation of 5 or 13 micrograms of Tris-Gal-Chol into LDL (20 micrograms of protein) stimulates the parenchymal cell association of LDL 6- and 10-fold, respectively, at 10 min after injection. For non-parenchymal cells, the cell association is 60- and 70-fold stimulated, respectively. It can be calculated that non-parenchymal cells (mainly Kupffer cells) are for 80-90% responsible for the increased, galactose-mediated, interaction of Tris-Gal-Chol LDL with the liver. The increased interaction of LDL with the cells upon Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation is followed by degradation of the apolipoprotein B in the lysosomes. Incorporation of Tris-Gal-Chol into unilamellar liposomes (10 mol %) leads to an increased cell association of the enclosed [3H]inulin to parenchymal cells (1.4-fold) and non-parenchymal cells (11.8-fold). It is concluded that Tris-Gal-Chol incorporation into LDL leads to a markedly increased catabolism of LDL by the liver which might be used for lowering serum LDL levels. The possibility of increasing the interaction of LDL or liposomes with specific liver cell types by Tris-Gal-Chol might also have an application for targeting drugs or other compounds of interest to these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1587028629,"The ligand binding subunit of the D2 subtype of the dopamine receptor has been identified by photoaffinity labeling. In order to develop a specific covalent receptor probe, an analogue of the potent D2 selective antagonist spiperone, N-(p-aminophenethyl)spiperone (NAPS) has been synthesized. The aminophenethyl substituent of NAPS can be radioiodinated to theoretical specific radioactivity (2,175 Ci/mmol) and then the arylamine group converted to an arylazide to yield a photosensitive probe [( 125I]N3-NAPS). In rat striatal membranes, the nonradiolabeled azide probe (N3-NAPS) binds to the receptor with high affinity (KD congruent to 1.6 +/- 0.05 nM) and upon photoactivation irreversibly decreases the number of available receptors in these membranes as measured by [3H]spiperone binding. More importantly, however, incubation of rat striatal membranes with [125I]N3-NAPS leads to the photodependent covalent incorporation of the probe into a peptide of Mr = 94,000 as assessed by autoradiography of gels after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Labeling of this Mr = 94,000 peptide can be blocked specifically and stereoselectively by dopaminergic antagonists such as (+)- and (-)-butaclamol but not by non-dopaminergic antagonists. Moreover, dopaminergic agonists also attenuate the covalent labeling of this peptide with an order of potency which is typically D2-dopaminergic. Therefore, the specificity of [125I]N3-NAPS labeling of the Mr = 94,000 peptide suggests that this peptide represents the ligand binding subunit of the D2-dopamine receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1585414188,"Hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCCH) are chlorinated analogs of inositol; the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isomers of HCCH have the stereochemical configurations of (+/-)-, scyllo-, muco-, and myo-inositol, respectively. To assess their potential as specific tools for the study of agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide metabolism, we examined the effects of these four HCCH isomers on phosphatidylinositol (PI) synthase (CDP-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol:myo-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase), PI:inositol exchange enzyme, and several membrane-associated enzymes unrelated to inositol metabolism. In pancreas microsomes, in the presence of saturating myo-inositol, the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta isomers (4 mM) inhibited PI synthase activity by 9, 4, 22, and 69%, respectively. Half-maximal inhibition by delta-HCCH occurred at 0.25 mM. A similar pattern of HCCH inhibition was obtained using n-octylglucopyranoside-solubilized and partially purified PI synthase preparations. The inhibition by delta-HCCH was noncompetitive versus myo-inositol. The PI:inositol exchange enzyme in mouse pancreas microsomes was inhibited 90% by 1 mM delta-HCCH in the presence of 0.25% Triton X-100, but not in its absence; half-maximal inhibition occurred with 0.5 mM delta-HCCH. delta-HCCH (4 mM) also inhibited to varying extents the following enzymes: pancreas CDP-choline:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (75%), brain and erythrocyte (Na+,K+)-ATPase (87 and 70%), brain and erythrocyte Mg2+-ATPase (38 and -5%), brain 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol kinase (22%), and liver glucose 6-phosphatase (16%). gamma-HCCH (4 mM) inhibited these enzymes to a lesser extent, or not at all. The order of inhibition by HCCH stereoisomers was the same as the order of their saturation level in phospholipid vesicles (delta greater than gamma greater than alpha greater than beta). This suggests that the inhibitory action is due to insertion of the compounds either into hydrophobic domains of the enzymes or into annular lipid. The results indicate that the HCCHs are not selective inhibitors of inositol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1520458024,"Human fibrinogen exposed to protease III from Crotalus atrox venom is cleaved near the NH2 terminus of the B beta chain yielding a species of Mr 325,000 (Fg325) with impaired thrombin clottability. The derivative was compared with intact fibrinogen in a number of ways to determine whether the functional defect resulted from a conformational change or from the loss of a polymerization site. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of isolated A alpha, B beta, and gamma chains showed that Fg325 contained intact A alpha and gamma chains, but differed from fibrinogen by the absence of the first 42 residues of the B beta chain. Fibrinopeptide A was present and was cleaved at the same rate in both fibrinogen and Fg325. The rate and extent of A alpha and gamma cross-linking by factor XIIIa was also indistinguishable. In contrast, the thrombin-catalyzed coagulation of Fg325 was 46% less in extent and 180-fold slower than observed for intact fibrinogen. A conformational comparison of Fg325 and fibrinogen was made using immunochemical and spectroscopic approaches. Antisera specific for different regions of the fibrinogen molecule were used to characterize the epitopes in Fg325. The only significant differences were found in the NH2-terminal region of the B beta chain, probed with antiserum to B beta 1-118. The conformational similarity of Fg325 and fibrinogen was confirmed by the identity of both near and far UV CD spectra of the two proteins. Structural, functional, and immunochemical results imply that cleavage of 42 NH2-terminal residues from the B beta chain is not accompanied by a measurable conformational change. The residues of this B beta chain segment, which are evidently located on the surface of the molecule, in conjunction with the NH2-terminal part of the A alpha chain appear to play an important role in the expression of a fibrin polymerization site."

https://openalex.org/W1570988466,"We are interested in determining whether carbohydrates are important regulatory determinants in the intracellular transport and secretion of glycoproteins. In the present study, we have used swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid, to modify the structure of N-glycosidically linked complex oligosaccharides. By inhibiting Golgi mannosidase II, swainsonine prevents the trimming of GlcNAc(Man)5(GlcNAc)2 to GlcNAc-(Man)3(GlcNAc)2, resulting in the formation of hybrid-type oligosaccharides. We find, from pulse-chase experiments using [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation of individual proteins from culture media, that swainsonine treatment (1 microgram/ml) accelerated the secretion of glycoproteins (transferrin, ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and alpha 1-antitrypsin) by decreasing the lag period by 10-15 min relative to untreated cultures. The enhanced secretion was specific for glycoproteins since the secretion of albumin, a nonglycoprotein, was unaffected. When alpha 1-antitrypsin was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fluorographic analysis demonstrated that the conversion of the high-mannose precursor to the hybrid form in swainsonine-treated cells occurred more rapidly (by about 10 min) than the conversion to the complex form in control cells. Since both the hybrid and complex forms of alpha 1-antitrypsin are terminally sialylated by sialyltransferase in the trans-Golgi, these results suggest that swainsonine-modified glycoproteins traverse the Golgi more rapidly than their normal counterparts. Therefore, accelerated transport within this organelle may account for the decreased lag period of glycoprotein secretion in the swainsonine-treated cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1541655913,"The receptor responsible for the transepithelial transport of IgA dimer antibodies is a transmembrane glycoprotein known as membrane secretory component (SCm). During transport, the membrane anchoring domain is cleaved and the ectoplasmic domain of the receptor (SCs) remains tightly bound to the IgA dimer in exosecretions. We have produced monoclonal antibodies with distinct specificities against both cytoplasmic and ectoplasmic epitopes of rabbit SCm. One antibody (anti-SC303) reacted both with SCm and free SCs but not with SCs bound to IgA dimer (SIgA). Therefore, it recognized an epitope close to the IgA dimer binding site. The other monoclonal antibody (anti-SC166), which was unable to react with SCs, bound to the 15-kDa cytoplasmic extension of the membrane-spanning domain of the receptor. A polyclonal antibody (GaR-SC), raised in a goat against rabbit milk SCs, reacted with a subpopulation of SCs not recognized by the anti-SC303 monoclonal antibody and in addition also reacted with covalently bound sIgA. The three antibodies cross-reacted with rat SCm. We demonstrate the ability of the anti-SC166 monoclonal antibody to immunoadsorb subcellular organelles as a result of the cytoplasmic orientation of its epitope. Our data indicate that there are functional differences between the high- and low-molecular-weight families of SC in terms of IgA dimer binding."
https://openalex.org/W1659021293,"A transcript from the yeast mitochondrial tRNAMetf gene has been isolated from a petite deletion mutant, ND40. RNA sequence analysis demonstrates that it has a 5' unprocessed extension of 28 nucleotides, and capping experiments with guanylyltransferase reveal that the first nucleotide has a 5' di- or triphosphate. A comparison of the RNA sequence with the tRNAMetf gene sequence reported here shows that transcription initiation occurs at a sequence homologous to a nonanucleotide segment implicated as a promoter element of yeast mitochondrial DNA. The 3' end of this transcript is identical to the mature tRNAMetf and carries a CCA sequence. The transcript can be processed in vitro to yield a mature tRNAMetf and thus appears to be a bona fide tRNA precursor. This tRNA precursor accumulates in the absence of the mitochondrial tRNA synthesis locus whereas mature tRNAMetf can be made from the same gene in the presence of the locus. This data provides clear and convincing evidence that the synthesis locus codes for a 5' tRNA processing function."
https://openalex.org/W2101575102,"Synchronized single-round transcriptions, in vitro, from templates encoding the leader RNA of the ilvB and ilvGEDA operons result in the accumulation of a transcript consistent with RNA polymerase pausing after the 1:2 stem that could form in each of the leader RNAs. Addition of L-factor or guanosine 5'-diphosphate,3-diphosphate extended the pause half-life obtained with the ilvB template; addition of L-factor and guanosine 5'-diphosphate,3'-diphosphate together had an additive effect on the pause half-life. L-factor also extended the pause half-life of the pause obtained with the ilvGEDA template; however, addition of guanosine 5'-diphosphate,3'-diphosphate did not. The results obtained are consistent with the model for attenuation proposed by Yanofsky et al. (Yanofsky, C., Das, A., Fisher, R., Kolter, R., and Berlin, V. (1984) UCLA Symposium of Gene Expression (Hamer, D., and Rosenberg, M., eds) pp. 295-310, Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York) in which transcriptional pausing after the synthesis of the 1:2 stem-loop closely couples transcription and translation of the leader region."
https://openalex.org/W1607383818,"The EDP208 pilus contains a major antigenic determinant in the N-terminal dodecapeptide, as shown by E. A. Worobec, A. K. Taneja, R. S. Hodges, and W. Paranchych ((1983) J. Bacteriol. 153, 955-961). This peptide was chemically synthesized, coupled to bovine serum albumin with N-hydroxysuccinimidyl p-azido-benzoate, and used in immunoblot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to show it was capable of reacting with anti-EDP208 pilus antibodies. Antibodies raised against the synthetic peptide conjugate were also capable of reacting with whole pili in these assays. To further examine the specific residues responsible for the antigenicity of this site, several peptide analogs were chemically synthesized. The relative affinity of these peptides for anti-EDP208 pilus antibodies was determined by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Fab fragment of anti-EDP208 pilus immunoglobulin G. From these results we established that the antigenic region of this peptide was the N-terminal pentapeptide, N-acetyl-Thr-Asp-Leu-Leu-Ala, and the key residues responsible for the antibody-antigen interaction are the N-acetyl-Thr1, Leu3, and Leu4. Hydrophobic interactions involving the methyl of the acetyl group and the leucine side chains make the largest contributions to the antigen-antibody interaction, while a lesser contribution is made by the Thr1 hydroxyl. The side chains of Asp2 and Ala5 contribute only weakly to the stabilization of the antigen-antibody complex."
https://openalex.org/W1593020328,"Radiation inactivation was used in situ to determine the functional unit sizes of the neurotoxin receptors of the voltage-dependent sodium channel from rat brain. Frozen or lyophilized synaptosomes were irradiated with high energy electrons generated by a linear accelerator and assayed for [3H]saxitoxin, 125I-Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus (alpha-scorpion toxin), 125I-Centruroides suffusus suffusus (beta-scorpion toxin), and batrachotoxinin-A 20 alpha-[3H]benzoate binding activity. The functional unit size of the neurotoxin receptors determined in situ by target analysis are 220,000 for saxitoxin, 263,000 for alpha-scorpion toxin, and 45,000 for beta-scorpion toxin. Analysis of the inactivation curve for batrachotoxinin-A 20 alpha-benzoate binding to the channel yields two target sizes of Mr approximately 287,000 (50%) and approximately 51,000 (50%). The results are independent of the purity of the membrane preparation. Comparison of the radiation inactivation data with the protein composition of the rat brain sodium channel indicates that there are at least two functional components."

https://openalex.org/W1605813297,"Monoclonal antibodies specific for the lactose repressor protein have been purified from three mouse hybridoma cell lines, and ascitic fluids from five other cell lines producing repressor antibodies have been assayed for immunoglobulin subclass and antigenic specificity. The chymotryptic core region (amino acids 57-360) of the repressor reacted with all antibodies examined, while no reaction with the NH2-terminal domain (1-56) could be detected. All of the purified antibodies and ascitic fluids reacted with the carboxyl-terminal fragment (amino acids 281-360) produced by cyanylation and base-catalyzed cleavage at the cysteine residues. Although none of the purified antibodies associated with native, tetrameric lac repressor, reaction was observed with repressor which had been denatured or dissociated into monomers by treatment with low levels of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Additionally, a mutant repressor which exists as a monomer in solution reacted with the antibodies in the absence of any denaturing treatments. These data indicate the carboxyl-terminal region is inaccessible in the intact repressor tetramer and further suggest that denaturation/dissociation of a protein during the initial immunologic challenge may result in the production of monoclonal antibodies to antigenic areas of the protein which are not exposed in the native conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1563674694,"Abstract The neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) activates a specific K+ conductance in the identified Aplysia neuron R15. This response to 5HT has been shown previously to be mediated by cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. We have measured protein phosphorylation within neuron R15 in vivo, following the intracellular injection of [gamma-32P]ATP, and have demonstrated that 5HT modulates the phosphorylation of a number of proteins in R15. The present study was undertaken to determine which of these phosphoproteins are closely associated with, and may be responsible for, the K+ conductance increase. Treatment of neuron R15 with a cAMP analog produces some but not all of the 5HT-induced phosphoprotein changes, indicating that some are not cAMP-dependent and thus can be dissociated from the cAMP-dependent K+ conductance increase. Similar results are obtained by intracellular injection of the adenylate cyclase inhibitor guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate), which completely blocks the 5HT-evoked K+ conductance increase but fails to block some of the 5HT-induced phosphorylation changes. Examination of the phosphoprotein pattern at short times after 5HT application has demonstrated that some of the phosphoprotein changes, but not others, are closely associated in time with the appearance of the physiological response. These and other pharmacological and kinetic experiments have allowed the identification of two phosphoproteins, of Mr = 29,000 and 70,000, which cannot be dissociated from the 5HT-induced K+ conductance increase whatever the experimental manipulation. Thus, one or both of these phosphoproteins may be involved in the regulation of the 5HT-sensitive K+ channel in neuron R15."
https://openalex.org/W1591229391,"We have isolated monoclonal antibodies against myosin from the eukaryotic microorganism Dictyostelium discoideum. Immunoblot analysis using chymotryptic fragments of myosin has shown that the 17 antibodies are directed against at least five different sites on the myosin heavy chain. Using an antibody (M342) that reacts with an epitope on the tail portion of the myosin molecule, we have developed an assay to quantitate myosin in whole cells and subcellular fractions. Samples are deposited on nitrocellulose paper using a filtration manifold and are probed with metabolically labeled M342 antibodies. The assay is rapid and sensitive; it permits the measurement of myosin even in crude cell lysates that contain detergent. By use of the filtration immunoassay, we have found that myosin constitutes 0.72% of the total protein in vegetative amoebae. We have also determined that Triton-resistant cell residues (cytoskeletons or cortical actin matrices) prepared in the absence of ATP contain nearly half of the cell's myosin. If ATP is present, 98% of that myosin is released, although actin levels do not diminish."
https://openalex.org/W1497167025,"A polyclonal sheep antibody to rat heart glycogen synthase has been used for immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation of both rat heart and liver synthase. The purified antibody completely inhibits glycogen synthase activity in rat heart preparations and specifically blots to a 93-kDa band in the 10,000 X g supernatants of both heart and liver homogenates. Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products from rat heart or liver poly(A+) RNA yields a unique band with a molecular mass of 93 kDa. Thus the subunit molecular mass of active glycogen synthase in rat heart is 93 kDa. In rat liver at least one form of glycogen synthase also appears to have a molecular mass of 93 kDa. Protocols used to purify rat liver synthase yield a subunit of 80-87 kDa, which retains activity, but which is no longer recognized by the antibody. This suggests that 1) a specific antigenic sequence has been proteolytically removed from the NH2 or COOH terminus of the protein, or 2) that limited proteolysis has led to a conformational change in the enzyme such that the antibody binding site is no longer recognized. Either or both of these possibilities represent a significant alteration in the enzyme due to proteolysis. In vitro studies using synthase preparations having molecular masses less than 93 kDa must be interpreted with caution due to possible structural changes which occur during purification which may alter the regulation or covalent modification of synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1496591808,"4.5 SI RNA is an abundant, noncapped, small nuclear RNA found in rodent cells. The 4.5 SI RNA is 98 or 99 nucleotides long and contains no modified nucleotides; it is synthesized by RNA polymerase III, is partly hydrogen-bonded to poly(A+) hnRNA, and was the first small nuclear RNA to be purified and sequenced (Busch, H., Reddy, R., Ruthblum, L., and Choi, Y. C. (1982) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 51, 617-654). In studies on the structure and organization of genes coding for this abundant RNA, it was found that this RNA is homologous to an apparently novel family of repetitive sequences. Two clones were characterized; one clone showed that its sequence is identical to the RNA in the first 92 residues and differed only in the last six nucleotides. In addition, the 3'-end of the sequence contained an A,T-rich region, and the sequence was flanked by a 15-nucleotide long direct repeat of AAAATATAGACACTG. The second clone characterized contained nucleotide sequences 1-57 corresponding to the RNA and was flanked by a 15-nucleotide long direct repeat. The structural features of these two DNAs are consistent with RNA-mediated DNA synthesis and integration of this DNA into the genome at random sites. It is estimated that there are about 10,000 copies of this family of sequences in the haploid rat genome."
https://openalex.org/W1482532377,"A significant increase in the molecular weights of lamin A and more so of lamin C was observed when isolated Novikoff hepatoma chromatin was incubated in the presence of Ca2+. This increase did not occur to any significant degree in similar preparations of normal rat liver nuclei. Although detectable in Coomassie Brilliant Blue stained gels, this increase to a higher molecular weight (by approximately 2000 Mr) was much more visible when the electrophoretically separated lamins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets and stained (using peroxidase-antiperoxidase) with polyclonal antiserum to the three major lamin proteins. This modification could also be induced when whole Novikoff hepatoma cell lysates were incubated in the presence of calcium. Again, this change did not occur in normal rat liver cells treated in the same manner. Further analysis has provided evidence that this modification is most likely mediated by the transaminating activity of an intrinsic nuclear transglutaminase forming a cross-link between the affected lamins and an unknown low molecular weight (approximately equal to 2000 Mr) moiety."
