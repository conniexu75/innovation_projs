https://openalex.org/W3147596910,"Metal halide perovskites of the general formula ABX3—where A is a monovalent cation such as caesium, methylammonium or formamidinium; B is divalent lead, tin or germanium; and X is a halide anion—have shown great potential as light harvesters for thin-film photovoltaics1–5. Among a large number of compositions investigated, the cubic α-phase of formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) has emerged as the most promising semiconductor for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells6–9, and maximizing the performance of this material in such devices is of vital importance for the perovskite research community. Here we introduce an anion engineering concept that uses the pseudo-halide anion formate (HCOO−) to suppress anion-vacancy defects that are present at grain boundaries and at the surface of the perovskite films and to augment the crystallinity of the films. The resulting solar cell devices attain a power conversion efficiency of 25.6 per cent (certified 25.2 per cent), have long-term operational stability (450 hours) and show intense electroluminescence with external quantum efficiencies of more than 10 per cent. Our findings provide a direct route to eliminate the most abundant and deleterious lattice defects present in metal halide perovskites, providing a facile access to solution-processable films with improved optoelectronic performance. Incorporation of the pseudo-halide anion formate during the fabrication of α-FAPbI3 perovskite films eliminates deleterious iodide vacancies, yielding solar cell devices with a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.21 per cent and long-term operational stability."

https://openalex.org/W3146171909,"Serotonin (5-HT) is a phylogenetically conserved monoamine neurotransmitter modulating important processes in the brain. To directly visualize the release of 5-HT, we developed a genetically encoded G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-activation-based 5-HT (GRAB5-HT) sensor with high sensitivity, high selectivity, subsecond kinetics and subcellular resolution. GRAB5-HT detects 5-HT release in multiple physiological and pathological conditions in both flies and mice and provides new insights into the dynamics and mechanisms of 5-HT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3149090762,"Genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) can enable a wide range of important applications including environmental sensing and responsive engineered living materials. However, containment of GMMs to prevent environmental escape and satisfy regulatory requirements is a bottleneck for real-world use. While current biochemical strategies restrict unwanted growth of GMMs in the environment, there is a need for deployable physical containment technologies to achieve redundant, multi-layered and robust containment. We developed a hydrogel-based encapsulation system that incorporates a biocompatible multilayer tough shell and an alginate-based core. This deployable physical containment strategy (DEPCOS) allows no detectable GMM escape, bacteria to be protected against environmental insults including antibiotics and low pH, controllable lifespan and easy retrieval of genomically recoded bacteria. To highlight the versatility of DEPCOS, we demonstrated that robustly encapsulated cells can execute useful functions, including performing cell-cell communication with other encapsulated bacteria and sensing heavy metals in water samples from the Charles River."
https://openalex.org/W3139572365,"Although high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has greatly advanced small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) discovery, the currently widely used complementary DNA library construction protocol generates biased sequencing results. This is partially due to RNA modifications that interfere with adapter ligation and reverse transcription processes, which prevent the detection of sncRNAs bearing these modifications. Here, we present PANDORA-seq (panoramic RNA display by overcoming RNA modification aborted sequencing), employing a combinatorial enzymatic treatment to remove key RNA modifications that block adapter ligation and reverse transcription. PANDORA-seq identified abundant modified sncRNAs—mostly transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs)—that were previously undetected, exhibiting tissue-specific expression across mouse brain, liver, spleen and sperm, as well as cell-specific expression across embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and HeLa cells. Using PANDORA-seq, we revealed unprecedented landscapes of microRNA, tsRNA and rsRNA dynamics during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, tsRNAs and rsRNAs that are downregulated during somatic cell reprogramming impact cellular translation in ESCs, suggesting a role in lineage differentiation. Shi et al. profiled small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) through PANDORA-seq, which identified tissue-specific transfer RNA- and ribosomal RNA-derived small RNAs, as well as sncRNAs, with dynamic changes during induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W3142043333,"During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, dozens of proteins assemble into an interconnected network at the plasma membrane. As initiators of endocytosis, Eps15 and Fcho1/2 concentrate downstream components, while permitting dynamic rearrangement within the budding vesicle. How do initiator proteins meet these competing demands? Here we show that Eps15 and Fcho1/2 rely on weak, liquid-like interactions to catalyse endocytosis. In vitro, these weak interactions promote the assembly of protein droplets with liquid-like properties. To probe the physiological role of these liquid-like networks, we tuned the strength of initiator protein assembly in real time using light-inducible oligomerization of Eps15. Low light levels drove liquid-like assemblies, restoring normal rates of endocytosis in mammalian Eps15-knockout cells. By contrast, initiator proteins formed solid-like assemblies upon exposure to higher light levels, which stalled vesicle budding, probably owing to insufficient molecular rearrangement. These findings suggest that liquid-like assembly of initiator proteins provides an optimal catalytic platform for endocytosis. Phase separation promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis; Day et al. show that Eps15 and Fcho1 rely on weak, liquid-like interactions to efficiently catalyse endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W3143565028,"Bronchiectasis, a progressive chronic airway disease, is characterized by microbial colonization and infection. We present an approach to the multi-biome that integrates bacterial, viral and fungal communities in bronchiectasis through weighted similarity network fusion ( https://integrative-microbiomics.ntu.edu.sg ). Patients at greatest risk of exacerbation have less complex microbial co-occurrence networks, reduced diversity and a higher degree of antagonistic interactions in their airway microbiome. Furthermore, longitudinal interactome dynamics reveals microbial antagonism during exacerbation, which resolves following treatment in an otherwise stable multi-biome. Assessment of the Pseudomonas interactome shows that interaction networks, rather than abundance alone, are associated with exacerbation risk, and that incorporation of microbial interaction data improves clinical prediction models. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of an independent cohort validated the multi-biome interactions detected in targeted analysis and confirmed the association with exacerbation. Integrative microbiomics captures microbial interactions to determine exacerbation risk, which cannot be appreciated by the study of a single microbial group. Antibiotic strategies probably target the interaction networks rather than individual microbes, providing a fresh approach to the understanding of respiratory infection."
https://openalex.org/W3143658323,"Cognition depends on integrating sensory percepts with the memory of recent stimuli. However, the distributed nature of neural coding can lead to interference between sensory and memory representations. Here, we show that the brain mitigates such interference by rotating sensory representations into orthogonal memory representations over time. To study how sensory inputs and memories are represented, we recorded neurons from the auditory cortex of mice as they implicitly learned sequences of sounds. We found that the neural population represented sensory inputs and the memory of recent stimuli in two orthogonal dimensions. The transformation of sensory information into a memory was facilitated by a combination of 'stable' neurons, which maintained their selectivity over time, and 'switching' neurons, which inverted their selectivity over time. Together, these neural responses rotated the population representation, transforming sensory inputs into memory. Theoretical modeling showed that this rotational dynamic is an efficient mechanism for generating orthogonal representations, thereby protecting memories from sensory interference."
https://openalex.org/W3152365143,"Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) maintain transcriptional silencing of developmental genes largely by catalyzing the formation of mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), respectively. How Polycomb domains are reprogrammed during mammalian preimplantation development remains largely unclear. Here we show that, although H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are highly colocalized in gametes, they undergo differential reprogramming dynamics following fertilization. H3K27me3 maintains thousands of maternally biased domains until the blastocyst stage, whereas maternally biased H2AK119ub1 distribution in zygotes is largely equalized at the two-cell stage. Notably, while maternal PRC2 depletion has a limited effect on global H2AK119ub1 in early embryos, it disrupts allelic H2AK119ub1 at H3K27me3 imprinting loci including Xist. By contrast, acute H2AK119ub1 depletion in zygotes does not affect H3K27me3 imprinting maintenance, at least by the four-cell stage. Importantly, loss of H2AK119ub1, but not H3K27me3, causes premature activation of developmental genes during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and subsequent embryonic arrest. Thus, our study reveals distinct dynamics and functions of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in mouse preimplantation embryos."
https://openalex.org/W3148247179,"Social interactions and relationships are often rewarding, but the neural mechanisms through which social interaction drives positive experience remain poorly understood. In this study, we developed an automated operant conditioning system to measure social reward in mice and found that adult mice of both sexes display robust reinforcement of social interaction. Through cell-type-specific manipulations, we identified a crucial role for GABAergic neurons in the medial amygdala (MeA) in promoting the positive reinforcement of social interaction. Moreover, MeA GABAergic neurons mediate social reinforcement behavior through their projections to the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and promote dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, activation of this MeA-to-MPOA circuit can robustly overcome avoidance behavior. Together, these findings establish the MeA as a key node for regulating social reward in both sexes, providing new insights into the regulation of social reward beyond the classic mesolimbic reward system."

https://openalex.org/W3149775180,"Rational During pandemics, including the most recent COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of university healthcare students’ is expected to be affected negatively, impacting the students’ learning process. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the level of anxiety and depression of healthcare students living in Jordan, and the effect on their learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey completed by students studying a healthcare-oriented degree in a university in Jordan. Participants were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The validated previously published Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was used as a part of the online survey to assess students’ anxiety/depression scores. Students’ responses regarding their learning process during the COVID-19 was also assessed. Results The mean age of participants was 21.62 (SD = 4.90), with the majority being females (67.1%). The HADs’ assessment revealed that 43.8% and 40.0% of participants had normal anxiety and depression scores, while 22.4% showed borderline abnormal anxiety/depression scores (33.8%). Many students (33.8%) were classified to have abnormal anxiety scores, while a smaller proportion (26.2%) was classified to have abnormal depression scores. Smoking (p = 0.022), lower family income (p = 0.039), and use of medications (p = 0.032) were positively associated with higher (worse) anxiety scores. Ranking the learning process during COVID-19 showed that 45.8% of the participants believed it was a ‘good/very good/excellent’ process. Conclusions Anxiety and depression levels amongst university healthcare students in Jordan were found to be high when assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the learning process during the pandemic was not accepted by more than half of the students. Implementing psychological interventions for healthcare students during pandemics is strongly recommended in order to optimize students’ mental health and their learning process alike."
https://openalex.org/W3144951232,"Evidence from model organisms and clinical genetics suggests coordination between the developing brain and face, but the role of this link in common genetic variation remains unknown. We performed a multivariate genome-wide association study of cortical surface morphology in 19,644 individuals of European ancestry, identifying 472 genomic loci influencing brain shape, of which 76 are also linked to face shape. Shared loci include transcription factors involved in craniofacial development, as well as members of signaling pathways implicated in brain-face cross-talk. Brain shape heritability is equivalently enriched near regulatory regions active in either forebrain organoids or facial progenitors. However, we do not detect significant overlap between shared brain-face genome-wide association study signals and variants affecting behavioral-cognitive traits. These results suggest that early in embryogenesis, the face and brain mutually shape each other through both structural effects and paracrine signaling, but this interplay may not impact later brain development associated with cognitive function."

https://openalex.org/W3151581762,"Pasteurella multocida is a bacterial pathogen with the ability to infect a multitude of hosts including humans, companion animals, livestock, and wildlife. This study used bioinformatic approaches to explore the genomic diversity of 656 P . multocida isolates and epidemiological associations between host factors and specific genotypes. Isolates included in this study originated from a variety of hosts, including poultry, cattle, swine, rabbits, rodents, and humans, from five different continents. Multi-locus sequence typing identified 69 different sequence types. In-silico methodology for determining capsular serogroup was developed, validated, and applied to all genome sequences, whereby capsular serogroups A, B, D, and F were found. Whole genome phylogeny was constructed from 237,670 core single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and demonstrated an overall lack of host or capsular serogroup specificity, with the exception of isolates from bovine sources. Specific SNVs within the srlB gene were identified in P . multocida subsp. septica genomes, representing specific mutations that may be useful for differentiating one of the three known subspecies. Significant associations were identified between capsular serogroup and virulence factors, including capsular serogroup A and OmpH1, OmpH3, PlpE, and PfhB1; capsular serogroup B and HgbA and PtfA; and capsular serogroup F and PtfA and PlpP. Various mobile genetic elements were identified including those similar to ICE Pmu 1, ICE hin1056 , and IncQ1 plasmids, all of which harbored multiple antimicrobial resistance-encoding genes. Additional analyses were performed on a subset of 99 isolates obtained from turkeys during fowl cholera outbreaks from a single company which revealed that multiple strains of P . multocida were circulating during the outbreak, instead of a single, highly virulent clone. This study further demonstrates the extensive genomic diversity of P . multocida , provides epidemiological context to the various genotyping schemes that have traditionally been used for differentiating isolates, and introduces additional tools for P . multocida molecular typing."
https://openalex.org/W3147216348,"Recent reports provide evidence that the platinum chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin causes cell death via ribosome biogenesis stress, while cisplatin causes cell death via the DNA damage response (DDR). Underlying differences in mechanisms that might initiate disparate routes to cell death by these two broadly used platinum compounds have not yet been carefully explored. Additionally, prior studies had demonstrated that cisplatin can also inhibit ribosome biogenesis. Therefore, we sought to directly compare the initial influences of oxaliplatin and cisplatin on nucleolar processes and on the DDR. Using pulse-chase experiments, we found that at equivalent doses, oxaliplatin but not cisplatin significantly inhibited ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis by Pol I, but neither compound affected rRNA processing. Inhibition of rRNA synthesis occurred as early as 90 min after oxaliplatin treatment in A549 cells, concurrent with the initial redistribution of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM1). We observed that the nucleolar protein fibrillarin began to redistribute by 6 h after oxaliplatin treatment and formed canonical nucleolar caps by 24 h. In cisplatin-treated cells, DNA damage, as measured by γH2AX immunofluorescence, was more extensive, whereas nucleolar organization was unaffected. Taken together, our results demonstrate that oxaliplatin causes early nucleolar disruption via inhibition of rRNA synthesis accompanied by NPM1 relocalization and subsequently causes extensive nucleolar reorganization, while cisplatin causes early DNA damage without significant nucleolar disruption. These data support a model in which, at clinically relevant doses, cisplatin kills cells via the canonical DDR, and oxaliplatin kills cells via ribosome biogenesis stress, specifically via rapid inhibition of rRNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W3146228361,"The lack of knowledge about extreme conservation in genomes remains a major gap in our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation. Here, we reveal an unexpected role of extremely conserved 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in noncanonical translational regulation that is linked to the emergence of essential developmental features in vertebrate species. Endogenous deletion of conserved elements within these 5' UTRs decreased gene expression, and extremely conserved 5' UTRs possess cis-regulatory elements that promote cell-type-specific regulation of translation. We further developed in-cell mutate-and-map (icM2), a new methodology that maps RNA structure inside cells. Using icM2, we determined that an extremely conserved 5' UTR encodes multiple alternative structures and that each single nucleotide within the conserved element maintains the balance of alternative structures important to control the dynamic range of protein expression. These results explain how extreme sequence conservation can lead to RNA-level biological functions encoded in the untranslated regions of vertebrate genomes."
https://openalex.org/W3152015584,"Habitat quality is an important indicator for evaluating the biodiversity provided by ecosystem. Estimating and scenario-simulating the dynamic evolution and future development trends of habitat quality under the influence of land-use change is significant in regional biodiversity conservation, formulating land-use planning, and maintaining the ecological environmental sustainability. In this article, we included the Huaihe River Economic Belt as the area of study because of its vital location in China and applied the CA–Markov and InVEST models to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of habitat quality and to simulate the future development trends of habitat quality under three different land-use scenarios: fast urban growth scenario, farmland conservation-oriented scenario, and ecological conservation-oriented scenario. The results showed that the land-use change in the Huaihe River Economic Belt was mostly represented by the continuous increase of the built-up area, whereas other land types all declined in area from 1995 to 2015. The land-use changes under these three abovementioned alternative future scenarios with different development orientations were considerably different. The built-up area has been shown to expand rapidly to occupy other land types on a large scale under the fast urban growth scenario. Urban land increased slightly and a large area of rural residential land would be converted into farmland under the farmland conservation-oriented scenario. The built-up area and farmland might decrease while woodland, grassland and water would increase in extent of areas under the ecological conservation-oriented scenario. Habitat quality has been shown to be generally poor, continuing to decline from 1995 to 2015, while its spatial distribution was higher in the southwest and northeast areas and lower in the central regions. The future habitat quality would display a downward trend under the fast urban growth and farmland conservation-oriented scenarios with a further deterioration of the ecological environment, while the ecological conservation-oriented scenario predicted the converse trend that the ecological environment would be improved productively. This study may be useful for understanding the impact of land-use dynamics on biodiversity. The research results can provide a scientific basis for the decision-makers to formulate biodiversity conservation and land management policies."
https://openalex.org/W3080479734,"We study correlations between the structure and properties of a free association network of the English language, and solutions of psycholinguistic Remote Association Tests (RATs). We show that average hardness of individual RATs is largely determined by relative positions of test words (stimuli and response) on the free association network. We argue that the solution of RATs can be interpreted as a first passage search problem on a network whose vertices are words and links are associations between words. We propose different heuristic search algorithms and demonstrate that in “easily-solving” RATs (those that are solved in 15 seconds by more than 64% subjects) the solution is governed by “strong” network links (i.e. strong associations) directly connecting stimuli and response, and thus the efficient strategy consist in activating such strong links. In turn, the most efficient mechanism of solving medium and hard RATs consists of preferentially following sequence of “moderately weak” associations."
https://openalex.org/W3142285965,"Loot boxes are digital containers of randomised rewards present in some video games which are often purchasable for real world money. Recently, concerns have been raised that loot boxes might approximate traditional gambling activities, and that people with gambling problems have been shown to spend more on loot boxes than peers without gambling problems. Some argue that the regulation of loot boxes as gambling-like mechanics is inappropriate because similar activities which also bear striking similarities to traditional forms of gambling, such as collectable card games, are not subject to such regulations. Players of collectible card games often buy sealed physical packs of cards, and these ‘booster packs’ share many formal similarities with loot boxes. However, not everything which appears similar to gambling requires regulation. Here, in a large sample of collectible card game players (n = 726), we show no statistically significant link between in real-world store spending on physical booster and problem gambling (p = 0.110, η 2 = 0.004), and a trivial in magnitude relationship between spending on booster packs in online stores and problem gambling (p = 0.035, η 2 = 0.008). Follow-up equivalence tests using the TOST procedure rejected the hypothesis that either of these effects was of practical importance (η 2 &gt; 0.04). Thus, although collectable card game booster packs, like loot boxes, share structural similarities with gambling, it appears that they may not be linked to problem gambling in the same way as loot boxes. We discuss potential reasons for these differences. Decisions regarding regulation of activities which share structural features with traditional forms of gambling should be made on the basis of definitional criteria as well as whether people with gambling problems purchase such items at a higher rate than peers with no gambling problems. Our research suggests that there is currently little evidence to support the regulation of collectable card games."
https://openalex.org/W3143467821,"Background Vitamin B 12 deficiency during pregnancy has been associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes. Few prospective studies have investigated vitamin B 12 status early in pregnancy, and its links to infant vitamin B 12 status, particularly in India where the burden of vitamin B 12 deficiency is estimated to be the highest globally. The objective of this study was to examine the associations of maternal vitamin B 12 biomarkers with neonatal vitamin B 12 status. Methods Pregnant women (~12 weeks’ gestation) were enrolled in a perinatal cohort study in Bangalore, India. Total vitamin B 12 , methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine concentrations were evaluated in maternal samples at enrollment and in neonates at birth using cord blood. Linear and binomial regression models were used to evaluate the associations of maternal vitamin B 12 biomarkers with neonatal vitamin B 12 status and perinatal outcomes. Results A total of 63.2% of women had vitamin B 12 deficiency (&lt;148 pmol/L), 87.2% had vitamin B 12 insufficiency (&lt;221 pmol/L), and 47.3% had impaired vitamin B 12 status (vitamin B 12 &lt;148 pmol/L and MMA&gt;0.26μmol/L) at enrollment; 40.8% of neonates had vitamin B 12 deficiency, 65.6% were insufficiency, and 38.1% had impaired vitamin B 12 status at birth. Higher maternal vitamin B 12 concentrations at enrollment were associated with increased neonatal vitamin B 12 concentrations (β(SE): 0.40 (0.05); p&lt;0.0001) and lower risk of neonatal vitamin B 12 deficiency (Risk Ratio [RR]: 0.53; 95% CI: [0.43, 0.65]; p&lt;0.0001). Maternal vitamin B 12 deficiency (RR: 1.97 [1.43, 2.71]; p&lt;0.001), insufficiency (RR: 2.18 [1.23, 3.85]; p = 0.007), and impaired vitamin B 12 status (RR: 1.49 [1.13, 1.97]; p = 0.005) predicted a two-fold increase in the risk of neonatal vitamin B 12 deficiency at birth. Conclusions The prevalence of vitamin B 12 deficiency was high early in pregnancy and predicted neonatal vitamin B 12 status. Future research is needed to determine the role of vitamin B 12 in the development of pregnancy and infant outcomes, and to inform screening and interventions to improve maternal and child health."

https://openalex.org/W3148075259,"Objectives Septic acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) carries a mortality risk nearing 50%. Risk factors associated with mortality in AKI patients undergoing CRRT with blood culture positive sepsis remain unclear as sepsis has been defined according to consensus criteria in previous studies. Methods Risk factors associated with intensive care unit (ICU), 90-day and overall mortality were studied in a retrospective cohort of 126 patients with blood culture positive sepsis and coincident severe AKI requiring CRRT. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical data were gathered at ICU admission and CRRT initiation. Results 38 different causative pathogens for sepsis and associated AKI were identified. ICU mortality was 30%, 90-day mortality 45% and one-year mortality 50%. Immunosuppression, history of heart failure, APACHE II and SAPS II scores, C-reactive protein and lactate at CRRT initiation were independently associated with mortality in multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Blood lactate showed good predictive power for ICU mortality in receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with AUCs of 0.76 (95%CI 0.66–0.85) for lactate at ICU admission and 0.84 (95%CI 0.72–0.95) at CRRT initiation. Conclusions Our study shows for the first time that lactate measured at CRRT initiation is predictive of ICU mortality and independently associated with overall mortality in patients with blood culture positive sepsis and AKI requiring CRRT.

All DCE analyses (p&lt;0.01–0.05), except v e (p = 0.02), showed significantly different results for PCa and benign lesions in the peripheral zone (PZ) with area under the curve (AUC) values of up to 0.92 for PI-RADS v2.1 overall classification. In the transition zone (TZ) only the qualitative DCE evalulation within PI-RADS (v1 and v2.1) could distinguish between PCa and benign lesions (p&lt;0.01; AUC = 0.95). None of the DCE parameters could differentiate csPCa from non-significant (ns) PCa (p ≥ 0.1). Qualitative analysis of DCE within mpMRI according to PI-RADS version 2.1 showed excellent results regarding (cs)PCa detection. Semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters provided no additional improvements. DCE alone wasn’t able to discriminate csPCa from nsPCa."
https://openalex.org/W3151092130,"Background Fatty Liver Index (FLI) is strongly associated with changes in glycemic status and incident Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The probability of reverting to normoglycemia from a state prediabetes could be determined by FLI, however such relationship remains poorly understood. Aim To determine the clinical interest of using FLI to estimate prediabetes reversion at 5 years in patients with impaired fasting plasma glucose at baseline, and identify those factors associated with changes in FLI, that could contribute to the reversion of prediabetes. Methods This 5-year cohort study included 16,648 Spanish working adults with prediabetes. Prediabetes was defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 100 and 125 mg/dl according to the ADA criteria, while prediabetes reversion was defined as a FPG &lt;100 mg/dL. The population was classified as: FLI &lt;30 (no hepatic steatosis), FLI 30–59 (intermediate status), and FLI ≥60 (hepatic steatosis). Results At 5 years follow-up, 33.7% of subjects reverted to normoglycemia (annual rate of 6.7%). The adjusted binomial logistic regression model showed that scoring FLI &lt;30 (OR 1.544; 95% CI 1.355–1.759), performing at least 150 min/week of physical activity (OR 4.600; 95% CI 4.088–5.177) and consuming fruits and vegetables daily (OR 1.682; 95% CI 1.526–1.855) were associated with the probability of reverting form prediabetes to normoglycemia. The ROC curve for prediction of reversion showed that FLI (AUC 0.774;95% CI 0.767–0.781) was a better predictor than FPG (AUC 0.656; 95% CI 0.648–0.664). Conclusions Regular physical activity, healthy dietary habits and absence of hepatic steatosis are independently associated with the probability of reversion to normoglycemia in adult workers with prediabetes at baseline. Low FLI values (especially FLI&lt; 30) may be useful to predict the probability of prediabetes reversion, especially in active subjects with healthy eating habits, and thus identify those who might benefit from early lifestyle intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3152250687,"Inhibins and activins are dimeric ligands belonging to the TGFβ superfamily with emergent roles in cancer. Inhibins contain an α-subunit ( INHA ) and a β-subunit (either INHBA or INHBB ), while activins are mainly homodimers of either β A ( INHBA ) or β B ( INHBB ) subunits. Inhibins are biomarkers in a subset of cancers and utilize the coreceptors betaglycan ( TGFBR3 ) and endoglin ( ENG ) for physiological or pathological outcomes. Given the array of prior reports on inhibin, activin and the coreceptors in cancer, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis, assessing their functional prognostic potential in cancer using a bioinformatics approach. We identify cancer cell lines and cancer types most dependent and impacted, which included p53 mutated breast and ovarian cancers and lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, INHA itself was dependent on TGFBR3 and ENG/CD105 in multiple cancer types. INHA , INHBA , TGFBR3 , and ENG also predicted patients’ response to anthracycline and taxane therapy in luminal A breast cancers. We also obtained a gene signature model that could accurately classify 96.7% of the cases based on outcomes. Lastly, we cross-compared gene correlations revealing INHA dependency to TGFBR3 or ENG influencing different pathways themselves. These results suggest that inhibins are particularly important in a subset of cancers depending on the coreceptor TGFBR3 and ENG and are of substantial prognostic value, thereby warranting further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3141242801,"The purpose of this study was to detect nutrient uptake and assimilation in woody plants subjected to growing media with some peat replaced by spent mushroom residue (SMR). Fragrant rosewood ( Dalbergia odorifera T.C. Chen) seedlings were cultured in five types of growing media with SMR and peat in volumetric proportions of 0% (control), 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. With the increase of SMR proportion, ammonium- and nitrate-nitrogen (N) concentrations declined but available phosphorus (P) concentration and electrical conductance both increased. Seedlings in the full SMR substrates showed obvious mortality. Seedlings in substrates with SMR in proportions higher than 25% showed symptoms of excessive N and P toxicities. The utilization efficiency for P was highest in the 25% SMR growing-media. Mineral N in substrates had a positive relationship with growth and biomass but not with glutamine synthetase activity. Available P was negatively related with acid phosphatase activity in both leaves and roots. Un-composted SMR can replace 25% of peat in growing media for fragrant rosewood seedlings, benefitting P uptake and assimilation."
https://openalex.org/W3145325318,"Hip extensor muscle size is related to sprint running performance. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. To gain insights into this issue, the present study examined the relationships between the individual hip extensor sizes, spatiotemporal variables (step frequency and length, and their determinants), and sprint velocity during maximal velocity sprinting. Magnetic resonance images of the hip and right thigh were obtained from 26 male sprinters to determine the volumes of the gluteus maximus, individual hamstrings and adductors, and gracilis. Muscle volumes were normalized to their respective body mass and recorded as relative muscle volumes. The sprinters performed a 100-m sprint with their maximal effort. Their sprint motions were recorded using cameras to calculate the mean sprint velocity and the spatiotemporal variables at 50–60 m interval. The sprint velocity was significantly correlated with the relative volume of the semitendinosus ( r = 0.497, P = 0.010), but not with the volumes of the other examined muscles. The relative volume of semitendinosus significantly correlated with the stance distance ( r = 0.414, P = 0.036) and the stance distance adjusted by the stance time ( r = 0.490, P = 0.011). Moreover, there were significant correlations between the stance distance and step length ( r = 0.592, P = 0.001), and between the step length and sprint velocity ( r = 0.509, P = 0.008). These results suggest that the semitendinosus contributes to attaining long stance distance and thereby high sprint velocity during maximal velocity sprinting."
https://openalex.org/W3150370388,"Excluding large native mammals is an inverse test of rewilding. A 25-year exclosure experiment in an African savanna rangeland offers insight into the potentials and pitfalls of the rewilding endeavor as they relate to the native plant community. A broad theme that has emerged from this research is that entire plant communities, as well as individual plants, adjust to the absence of herbivores in ways that can ill-prepare them for the return of these herbivores. Three lines of evidence suggest that these “naïve” individuals, populations, and communities are likely to initially suffer from herbivore rewilding. First, plots protected from wild herbivores for the past 25 years have developed rich diversity of woody plants that are absent from unfenced plots, and presumably would disappear upon rewilding. Second, individuals of the dominant tree in this system, Acacia drepanolobium , greatly reduce their defences in the absence of browsers, and the sudden arrival of these herbivores (in this case, through a temporary fence break), resulted in far greater elephant damage than for their conspecifics in adjacent plots that had been continually exposed to herbivory. Third, the removal of herbivores favoured the most palatable grass species, and a large number of rarer species, which presumably would be at risk from herbivore re-introduction. In summary, the native communities that we observe in defaunated landscapes may be very different from their pre-defaunation states, and we are likely to see some large changes to these plant communities upon rewilding with large herbivores, including potential reductions in plant diversity. Lastly, our experimental manipulation of cattle represents an additional test of the role of livestock in rewilding. Cattle are in many ways ecologically dissimilar to wildlife (in particular their greater densities), but in other ways they may serve as ecological surrogates for wildlife, which could buffer ecosystems from some of the ecological costs of rewilding. More fundamentally, African savannah ecosystems represent a challenge to traditional Western definitions of “wilderness” as ecosystems free of human impacts. We support the suggestion that as we “rewild” our biodiversity landscapes, we redefine “wildness” in the 21 st Century to be inclusive of (low impact, and sometimes traditional) human practices that are compatible with the sustainability of native (and re-introduced) biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W3145235152,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most widespread natural and anthropogenic pollutants, and some PAHs are proven developmental toxicants. We chemically characterized clean and heavily polluted sites and exposed fish embryos to PAH polluted sediment extracts during four critical developmental stages. Embryos were collected from Fundulus heteroclitus populations inhabiting the clean and heavily polluted Superfund estuary. Embryos of parents from the clean sites are sensitive to PAH pollutants while those of parents from the heavily polluted site are resistant. Chemical analysis of embryos suggests PAH accumulation and pollution-induced toxicity among sensitive embryos during development that ultimately kills all sensitive embryos before hatching, while remarkably, the resistant embryos develop normally. The adverse effects on sensitive embryos are manifested as developmental delays, reduced heart rates, and severe heart, liver, and kidney morphological abnormalities. Gene expression analysis of early somitogenesis, heartbeat initiation, late organogenesis, and pre-hatching developmental stages reveals genes whose expression significantly differs between sensitive and resistant embryo populations and helps to explain mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to polluted environments during vertebrate animal development."
https://openalex.org/W3145622682,"The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) predicts that personality and metabolism should be correlated if they function as an integrated unit along a slow-fast continuum. Over the last decade, this conceptual framework has been tested in several empirical studies over a wide array of non-human animal taxa, across multiple personality traits and using standardized measures of metabolism. However, studies associating metabolic rate and personality in humans have been surprisingly scarce. Here, we tested whether there was covariation among personality scores, measured using the Big Five Inventory test, resting metabolic rate (RMR) and preferred walking speed (PWS) in a cohort of young human adults aged between 18 and 27 years old. We found a significant, negative relationship between RMR and Extraversion; less extraverted individuals had a 30% higher RMR than the most extraverted ones. No other personality traits correlated with RMR and none correlated with PWS. The negative correlation between Extraversion and RMR may suggest an allocation energy trade-off between personality and basal metabolism. Our results yielded equivocal support for the POLS and emphasized the need for more research on human to test the generality of this conceptual framework and further assess its validity."
https://openalex.org/W3140780247,"Objective To examine whether proximity and density of public open spaces, public parks, street connectivity, and serious and violent crimes were associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) within and across levels of urbanicity, sex and socioeconomic status (SES) in Jamaica, a small island developing state (SIDS). Methods Secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey 2008 (JHLS II). All respondents were geocoded to area of residence in Enumeration Districts (EDs). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were derived and multilevel mixed effects regression models applied to 2529 participants nested within 101 EDs from all 14 parishes in Jamaica. Results There was significant clustering across neighborhoods for mean BMI (ICC = 4.16%) and mean WC (ICC = 4.42%). In fully adjusted models statistically significant associations included: increased mean BMI among men, with increased intersection density/ km 2 (β = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.96 x10 -3 , 0.04, p = 0.032); increased mean WC among urban residents with increased crimes/km 2 /yr (β = 0.09; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.16, p &lt;0.01) and among persons in the middle class, with further distance away from public parks (β = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.08, 0.53, p &lt;0.01). Conclusions Neighborhood physical and crime environments were associated with obesity-related outcomes in Jamaica. Policymakers in SIDS such as Jamaica should also note the important differences by urbanicity, sex and SES in prevention efforts designed to stem the growing obesity epidemic."

Objective To identify moderating factors that may help explain the difference in the prevalence of anemia in children from poor urban vs . rural areas of Haiti. Methods This cross-sectional study used secondary data from urban and rural school-based trials that assessed the effectiveness of a nutrition intervention. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT02747524. A total of 300 rural- and 981 urban- children between 2.5–13 years of age were included in this analysis. Effect modification in a binary logistic generalized linear mixed model was conducted using sample weights in SPSS ® version 26. Models were adjusted for age and income. School cluster was included as random effect. Results In rural areas, stunting was more prevalent in children with anemia vs . no anemia, (16.6%, and 6.3%, P = 0.008), respectively. Also, rural children with anemia lived with fewer adults vs . rural children with no anemia, ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:mover accent=""true""><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">x</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math> = 2.83±1.29, and 3.30±1.54, P = 0.005), respectively. In poor urban areas, helminth morbidities were more frequent in children with anemia vs . no anemia, (21.9% vs. 13.9, P = 0.011), respectively. In the combined sample, stunting, [AOR = 2.05; 95%CI (1.32–3.18)], age [AOR = 0.89; 95%CI (0.85–0.93)], and households with more adults [AOR = 0.77; 95%CI (0.67–0.87)] were associated with anemia. Effect modification by place of residence was observed in households with more adults (t = 3.83, P&lt;0.001). No other nutritional, dietary, sanitation or morbidity factors or effect modifiers were observed. Conclusions In this sample, factors associated with anemia differed in poor urban and rural children from Haiti including family structure and helminth morbidities. Stunting and lower age increased the odds of anemia in the combined sample. Family structure appears to have an important role in anemia, and further research understanding the influence of family structures in anemia is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3143131531,"Background Some studies have indicated that the use of prokinetic agents may reduce pneumonia risk in some populations. Nasogastric tube insertion is known to increase the risk of pneumonia because it disrupts lower esophageal sphincter function. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether prokinetic agents could protect long-term nasogastric tube-dependent patients in Taiwan from being hospitalized for pneumonia. Methods A case-crossover study design was applied in this study. Long-term nasogastric tube-dependent patients who had a first-time admission to a hospital due to pneumonia from 1996 to 2013 that was recorded in the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database were included. The case period was set to be 30 days before admission, and two control periods were selected for analysis. Prokinetic agent use during those three periods was then assessed for the included patients. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for pneumonia admission with the use of prokinetic agents. Results A total of 639 first-time hospitalizations for pneumonia among patients with long-term nasogastric tube dependence were included. After adjusting the confounding factors for pneumonia, no negative association between prokinetic agent use and pneumonia hospitalization was found, and the adjusted OR was 1.342 (95% CI 0.967–1.86). In subgroup analysis, the adjusted ORs were 1.401 (0.982–1.997), 1.256 (0.87–1.814), 0.937 (0.607–1.447) and 2.222 (1.196–4.129) for elderly, stroke, diabetic and parkinsonism patients, respectively. Conclusion Prokinetic agent use had no negative association with pneumonia admission among long-term nasogastric tube-dependent patients in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W3143329691,"Expressed emotion (EE) and self-esteem (SE) have been implicated in the onset and development of paranoia and positive symptoms of psychosis. However, the impact of EE on patients’ SE and ultimately on symptoms in the early stages of psychosis is still not fully understood. The main objectives of this study were to examine whether: (1) patients’ SE mediated the effect of relatives’ EE on patients’ positive symptoms and paranoia; (2) patients’ perceived EE mediated the effect of relatives’ EE on patients’ SE; (3) patients’ SE mediated between patients’ perceived EE and patients’ symptomatology; and (4) patients’ perceived EE and patients’ SE serially mediated the effect of relatives’ EE on patients’ positive symptoms and paranoia. Incipient psychosis patients (at-risk mental states and first-episode of psychosis) and their respective relatives completed measures of EE, SE, and symptoms. Findings indicated that: (1) patients’ perceived EE mediated the link between relatives’ EE and patients’ negative, but not positive, SE; (2) patients’ negative SE mediated the effect of patients’ perceived EE on positive symptoms and paranoia; (3) the association of relatives’ EE with positive symptoms and paranoia was serially mediated by an increased level of patients’ perceived EE leading to increases in negative SE; (4) high levels of patients’ distress moderated the effect of relatives’ EE on symptoms through patients’ perceived EE and negative SE. Findings emphasize that patients’ SE is relevant for understanding how microsocial environmental factors impact formation and expression of positive symptoms and paranoia in early psychosis. They suggest that broader interventions for patients and their relatives aiming at improving family dynamics might also improve patients’ negative SE and symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3146746203,"Culicoides are one of the smallest hematophagous flies measuring 1–5 mm in size with only females seeking blood for egg development. The present study investigated spatio-temporal distribution of Culicoides species trapped between 1990 and 2018 at 13 sites in the New England region of NSW, Australia using automated light traps. Trapping locations were divided into three subregions (tablelands, slopes and plains). Nineteen Culicoides species were identified. Culicoides marksi and C . austropalpalis were the most abundant and widespread species. Culicoides brevitarsis , the principal vector of livestock diseases in New South Wales comprised 2.9% of the total catch and was detected in 12 of the 13 locations in the study. Abundance as determined by Log 10 Culicoides count per trapping event for the eight most abundant species did not vary significantly with season but trended towards higher counts in summer for C . marksi (P = 0.09) and C . austropalpalis (P = 0.05). Significant geographic variation in abundance was observed for C . marksi , C . austropalpalis and C . dycei with counts decreasing with increasing altitude from the plains to the slopes and tablelands. Culicoides victoriae exhibited the reverse trend in abundance (P = 0.08). Greater abundance during the warmer seasons and at lower altitudes for C . marksi and C . austropalpalis was indicative of temperature and rainfall dependence in this region with moderate summer dominance in rainfall. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index of species was higher on the tablelands (H = 1.59) than the slopes (H = 1.33) and plains (H = 1.08) with evenness indices of 0.62, 0.46 and 0.39 respectively. Culicoides species on the tablelands were more diverse than on the slopes and plains where C . marksi and C . austropalpalis dominated. The temporal and spatial variation in abundance, diversity and evenness of species reported in this diverse region of Australia provides additional insight into Culicoides as pests and disease vectors and may contribute to future modelling studies."
https://openalex.org/W3151437774,"Introduction The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus—2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of ≥ 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of ≥ 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of ≥ 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost."

https://openalex.org/W3143151569,"Serine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) was recently reported as being necessary to preserve RNA stability via an mTOR mechanism in a cardiac mouse model in adulthood. Here, we demonstrate the link between Srsf3 and mitochondrial integrity in an embryonic cardiomyocyte-specific Srsf3 conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model. Fifteen-day-old Srsf3 cKO mice showed dramatically reduced (below 50%) survival and reduced the left ventricular systolic performance, and histological analysis of these hearts revealed a significant increase in cardiomyocyte size, confirming the severe remodeling induced by Srsf3 deletion. RNA-seq analysis of the hearts of 5-day-old Srsf3 cKO mice revealed early changes in expression levels and alternative splicing of several transcripts related to mitochondrial integrity and oxidative phosphorylation. Likewise, the levels of several protein complexes of the electron transport chain decreased, and mitochondrial complex I-driven respiration of permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers from the left ventricle was impaired. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy analysis showed disordered mitochondrial length and cristae structure. Together with its indispensable role in the physiological maintenance of mouse hearts, these results highlight the previously unrecognized function of Srsf3 in regulating the mitochondrial integrity."

To our knowledge, however, no studies have examined the nature of FBC exclusively among young females, even though they are overrepresented in media stories of breast cancer. Given that no instruments are available to assess FBC in the Spanish language, we sought to 1) evaluate the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Champion Breast Cancer Fear Scale (CBCFS), and 2) offer preliminary data on the nature of FBC among young women. Participants (N = 442, mean age = 21.17, range 17–35) completed the translated CBCFS (CBCFS-es) and the Spanish version of the Short Health Anxiety Inventory. The CBCFS-es demonstrated good concurrent validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Confirmatory factor analysis showed adequate fit to a one-factor solution. The majority of participants reported considerably high levels of FBC, as 25.34% and 59.73% of them scored above the moderate- and high-FBC cut-offs, respectively. Moreover, FBC could not be explained by general concerns regarding health and illness, given that levels of health anxiety were low. Implications for health education, research, and clinical practice are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3152086622,"Background Early initiation of the antenatal clinic is vital as it allows early detection, management, and prevention of problems that may occur during pregnancy time. The analysis aimed to determine the prevalence and factors which influence early antenatal booking among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. Method The study used data from the 2015–16 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicators Survey (2015–16 TDHS-MIS). A total of 6924 women of active reproductive age from 15 to 49 were included in the analysis. Both univariate and multiple regression analyses were used to determine predictors of early antenatal booking. Results Only 1586 (22.9%) of pregnant women had early antenatal booking. After adjusted for the confounders, factors which influenced early antenatal booking were age of a woman [20 to 34 years, Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.554 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.213–1.993, and more than 34 years, AOR = 1.758 at 95% CI = 1.306–2.368]; wealth status [rich, AOR = 1.520 at 95% CI = 1.282–1.802]; education level [higher education, AOR = 2.355 at 95% CI = 1.36–4.079]; parity [Para 2 to 3, AOR = 0.85 at 95% CI = 0.727–0.994 and Para 5+, AOR = 0.577 at 95%CI = 0.465–0.715]; zones [Unguja, AOR = 0.433 at 95% CI = 0.284–0.658 and Pemba, AOR = 0.392 at 95% CI = 0.236–0.649]. Conclusion Early antenatal booking in Tanzania is extremely low. Women who were more likely to initiate antenatal visits within the first 12 weeks are those from well-off families, those with higher education, primiparity women, and those from Tanzania mainland urban. The innovative interventional study is highly recommended to come up with an effective strategy to improve timing for antenatal booking."

Data on the genetically identified river stock of origin of individual fish from commercial mixed stock catches were used to compare the catch size-at-age of mature Atlantic salmon catch fish ( Salmo salar ) from different rivers in the Baltic Sea. In this application of genetic mixed stock modeling, individual assignments of the river stock of origin were analyzed together with length- and weight-at-age data for individual catch fish. The use of four genetic stock identification based methods was compared for defining the length distributions of caught mature salmon in different river stocks. The catch data included information on maturing salmon in the northern Baltic Sea over the years 2000–2013. DNA microsatellite data on 17 loci and information on the smoltification age were used to assign spawners to their stock of origin. All of the compared methods for using probabilistic stock of origin data in our case yielded very similar estimates of the final mean length distributions of the stocks. The Bayesian mixture model yielded slightly more conservative estimates than the direct probability method, threshold method, or the modified probability method. The catch size between spawners of a same sex and age from river stocks differed significantly and the differences were large. The mean catch weight of 1-sea-winter old mature males in different rivers varied from 1.9 kg to 2.9 kg, from 5.1 kg to 7.5 kg for 2-sea-winter old males, from 5.0 kg to 7.2 kg for 2-sea-winter old females, and from 8.2 kg to 10.8 kg for 3-sea-winter-old females. The mean size of caught wild salmon spawners in each year-class was on average smaller than that of the hatchery-reared and sea ranched stocks."
https://openalex.org/W3148560618,"Since their first sequencing 40 years ago, Dengue virus (DENV) genotypes have shown extreme coherence regarding the serotype class they encode. Considering that DENV is a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus with a high mutation rate, this behavior is intriguing. Here, we explore the effect of various parameters on likelihood of new serotype emergence. In order to determine the time scales of such an event, we used a Timed Markov Transmission Model to explore the influences of sylvatic versus peri-urban transmission, viral mutation rate, and vertical transmission on the probabilities of novel serotype emergence. We found that around 1 000 years are required for a new serotype to emerge, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of extant dengue serotypes. Furthermore, we show that likelihood of establishing chains of mosquito-human-mosquito infection, known as consolidation, is the primary factor which constrains novel serotype emergence. Our work illustrates the restrictions on and provides a mechanistic explanation for the low probability of novel dengue virus serotype emergence and the low number of observed DENV serotypes."

For example, thoracostomies, tracheotomies and intubations/extubations produce aerosols that can linger in the air. The lingering time is dependent on particle size where, e.g., 500 μm (0.5 mm) particles may quickly fall to the floor, while 1 μm particles may float for extended lengths of time. Here, a method is presented to characterize the size of &lt;40 μm to &gt;600 μm particles resulting from surgery in an operating room (OR). The particles are measured in-situ (next to a patient on an operating table) through a 75mm aperture in a ∼400 mm rectangular enclosure with minimal flow restriction. The particles and gasses exiting a patient are vented through an enclosed laser sheet while a camera captures images of the side-scattered light from the entrained particles. A similar optical configuration was described by Anfinrud et al .; however, we present here an extended method which provides a calibration method for determining particle size. The use of a laser sheet with side-scattered light provides a large FOV and bright image of the particles; however, the particle image dilation caused by scattering does not allow direct measurement of particle size. The calibration routine presented here is accomplished by measuring fixed particle distribution ranges with a calibrated shadow imaging system and mapping these measurements to the in-situ imaging system. The technique used for generating and measuring these particles is described. The result is a three-part process where 1) particles of varying sizes are produced and measured using a calibrated, high-resolution shadow imaging method, 2) the same particle generators are measured with the in-situ imaging system, and 3) a correlation mapping is made between the (dilated) laser image size and the measured particle size. Additionally, experimental and operational details of the imaging system are described such as requirements for the enclosure volume, light management, air filtration and control of various laser reflections. Details related to the OR environment and requirements for achieving close proximity to a patient are discussed as well."
https://openalex.org/W3145232640,"This paper analyzes the imbalance of interprovincial population flow during the Spring Festival travel rush in China, using big data obtained through Baidu Migration, in terms of population flow during the festival and the normalized unbalanced coefficients of edge and node method for analysis, from which the following findings emerge: (1). The imbalance in population flow network during the Spring Festival travel rush is significant, with unbalanced coefficients and relevant frequencies of the population flow network in the Eastern and Western Regions being significantly higher than in other regions. The unbalanced coefficients in the Central Region are lower, followed by corresponding frequencies, while the unbalanced coefficients in the Northeast Region are evenly distributed with the lowest frequencies. The population flow toward the West and Northwest are relatively concentrated, while the population flow toward the South and Southwest are relatively scattered. (2). The regional imbalance during the Spring Festival travel rush has characteristics of spatial agglomeration, where a strongly-connected Southeast Subsystem and a weakly-connected Western Subsystem are formed; there is a significant leverage effect in Guangdong Province, which greatly affects the regional imbalance. Three characteristics emerge in the distribution of regional population flow—the outflow, inflow, and outflow along the Eastern, Central and Western strips/lines, respectively. The paper emphasizes the importance of researching imbalance issues, clarifies the difference between the imbalance of the population flow network and the imbalance involved in previous population research fields, and discusses the Spring Festival Effect in terms of population flow and deficiencies in research."
https://openalex.org/W3148684946,"Monophasic Salmonella 4,[5]:12:i:- are a major public health problem because they are one of the top five Salmonella serotypes isolated from clinical cases globally and because they can carry resistance to multiple antibiotics. A total of 811 Salmonella 4,[5]:12:i:- and S . Typhimurium whole genome sequences (WGS) were generated. The various genetic lesions causing the Salmonella 4,[5]:12:i:- genotype were identified and assessed with regards to their distribution in the population of 811 Salmonella 4,[5]:12:i:- and S . Typhimurium isolates, their geographical and temporal distribution, and their association with non-human sources. Several clades were identified in the population structure, and the largest two were associated almost exclusively with a short prophage insertion and insertion of a mobile element carrying loci encoding antibiotic and mercury resistance. IS26 -mediated deletions and fljB point mutants appeared to spread clonally. ‘Inconsistent’ Salmonella 4,[5]:12:i:- isolates associated with specific, single amino acid changes in fljA and hin were found in a single clade composed of water, shellfish, and avian isolates. Inclusion of isolates from different case clusters identified previously by PFGE validated some of the clusters and invalidated others. Some wgMLST clusters of clinical isolates composed of very closely related isolates contained an isolate(s) with a different genetic lesion, suggesting continuing mobility of the implicated element responsible. Such cases may need to be left out of epidemiological investigations until sufficient numbers of isolates are included that statistical significance of association with sources is not impaired. Non-human sources were frequently found in or near clinical case clusters. Prospective surveillance and WGS of non-human sources and retrospective analysis by WGS of isolates from existing culture collections provides data critical for epidemiological investigations of food- and waterborne outbreaks."
