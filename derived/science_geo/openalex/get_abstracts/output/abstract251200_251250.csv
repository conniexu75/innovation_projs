https://openalex.org/W1964395868,"With energy conservation high on the political agenda, the search for economical light sources is a hot topic. An advance reported this week could be an important step in the field. It introduces a new architecture for making organic light-emitting devices that produce white light suitable for solid-state lighting. What is new is the use of fluorescent and phosphorescent light-emitting dopants arranged to optimize harvesting of the electric charge and achieve potentially 100% internal quantum efficiency. Technology of this type has the potential to make OLEDs (organic light emitting devices) much more efficient than incandescent lighting. Even at an early stage of development this new source is up to 75% more efficient than today's incandescent sources at similar brightnesses. Through careful management of the bound electron–hole pairs responsible for light emission, efficiencies can be achieved that should challenge those of the incandescent sources responsible for a substantial amount of domestic and commercial electricity consumption. Lighting accounts for approximately 22 per cent of the electricity consumed in buildings in the United States, with 40 per cent of that amount consumed by inefficient (∼15 lm W-1) incandescent lamps1,2. This has generated increased interest in the use of white electroluminescent organic light-emitting devices, owing to their potential for significantly improved efficiency over incandescent sources combined with low-cost, high-throughput manufacturability. The most impressive characteristics of such devices reported to date have been achieved in all-phosphor-doped devices, which have the potential for 100 per cent internal quantum efficiency2: the phosphorescent molecules harness the triplet excitons that constitute three-quarters of the bound electron–hole pairs that form during charge injection, and which (unlike the remaining singlet excitons) would otherwise recombine non-radiatively. Here we introduce a different device concept that exploits a blue fluorescent molecule in exchange for a phosphorescent dopant, in combination with green and red phosphor dopants, to yield high power efficiency and stable colour balance, while maintaining the potential for unity internal quantum efficiency. Two distinct modes of energy transfer within this device serve to channel nearly all of the triplet energy to the phosphorescent dopants, retaining the singlet energy exclusively on the blue fluorescent dopant. Additionally, eliminating the exchange energy loss to the blue fluorophore allows for roughly 20 per cent increased power efficiency compared to a fully phosphorescent device. Our device challenges incandescent sources by exhibiting total external quantum and power efficiencies that peak at 18.7 ± 0.5 per cent and 37.6 ± 0.6 lm W-1, respectively, decreasing to 18.4 ± 0.5 per cent and 23.8 ± 0.5 lm W-1 at a high luminance of 500 cd m-2."

https://openalex.org/W2166536235,"Although much speculated on, no microorganisms had been shown capable of anaerobic methane oxidation using nitrate as the sole electron acceptor. Now this reaction has been demonstrated in the laboratory in a microbial community with two members, one a slow-growing bacterium of a type that has not cultured before, and one an archaeal organism. Nucleic acid markers characteristic of both are present in freshwater samples worldwide, suggesting that this reaction is important in the biological methane and nitrogen cycles. It also has the potential to be used to counteract the increases in methane production associated with intensive agriculture. Although much speculated on, this is the first unambiguous report demonstrating the isolation of a consortium of microorganisms capable of anaerobic methane oxidation using nitrate as the sole electron acceptor. Modern agriculture has accelerated biological methane and nitrogen cycling on a global scale1,2. Freshwater sediments often receive increased downward fluxes of nitrate from agricultural runoff and upward fluxes of methane generated by anaerobic decomposition3. In theory, prokaryotes should be capable of using nitrate to oxidize methane anaerobically, but such organisms have neither been observed in nature nor isolated in the laboratory4,5,6,7,8. Microbial oxidation of methane is thus believed to proceed only with oxygen or sulphate9,10. Here we show that the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification of nitrate is possible. A microbial consortium, enriched from anoxic sediments, oxidized methane to carbon dioxide coupled to denitrification in the complete absence of oxygen. This consortium consisted of two microorganisms, a bacterium representing a phylum without any cultured species and an archaeon distantly related to marine methanotrophic Archaea. The detection of relatives of these prokaryotes in different freshwater ecosystems worldwide11,12,13,14 indicates that the reaction presented here may make a substantial contribution to biological methane and nitrogen cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2135792715,"Enhanced plant biomass accumulation in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration could dampen the future rate of increase in CO2 levels and associated climate warming. However, it is unknown whether CO2-induced stimulation of plant growth and biomass accumulation will be sustained or whether limited nitrogen (N) availability constrains greater plant growth in a CO2-enriched world. Here we show, after a six-year field study of perennial grassland species grown under ambient and elevated levels of CO2 and N, that low availability of N progressively suppresses the positive response of plant biomass to elevated CO2. Initially, the stimulation of total plant biomass by elevated CO2 was no greater at enriched than at ambient N supply. After four to six years, however, elevated CO2 stimulated plant biomass much less under ambient than enriched N supply. This response was consistent with the temporally divergent effects of elevated CO2 on soil and plant N dynamics at differing levels of N supply. Our results indicate that variability in availability of soil N and deposition of atmospheric N are both likely to influence the response of plant biomass accumulation to elevated atmospheric CO2. Given that limitations to productivity resulting from the insufficient availability of N are widespread in both unmanaged and managed vegetation, soil N supply is probably an important constraint on global terrestrial responses to elevated CO2."

https://openalex.org/W2157445945,"Runx2/Cbfa1/Pebp2aA is a global regulator of osteogenesis and is crucial for regulating the expression of bone-specific genes. Runx2 is a major target of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. Genetic analysis has revealed that Runx2 is degraded through a Smurf-mediated ubiquitination pathway, and its activity is inhibited by HDAC4. Here, we demonstrate the molecular link between Smurf, HDACs and Runx2, in BMP signaling. BMP-2 signaling stimulates p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation, increasing transactivation activity and inhibiting Smurf1-mediated degradation of Runx2. HDAC4 and HDAC5 dea-cetylate Runx2, allowing the protein to undergo Smurf-mediated degradation. Inhibition of HDAC increases Runx2 acetylation, and potentiates BMP-2-stimulated osteoblast differentiation and increases bone formation. These results demonstrate that the level of Runx2 is controlled by a dynamic equilibrium of acetylation, deacetylation, and ubiquitination. These findings have important medical implications because BMPs and Runx2 are of tremendous interest with regard to the development of therapeutic agents against bone diseases.

Runx2/Cbfa1/Pebp2αA is a transcription factor belonging to the Runx family, which contains three members: Runx1, Runx2, and Runx3 (1van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Gergen J.P. Groner Y. Hiebert S.W.

The importance of Runx proteins in mammalian development has been clearly demonstrated by gene disruption studies (2Ito Y. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4198-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos with homozygous mutations in Runx1 showed normal morphogenesis and yolk sac-derived primitive hematopoiesis, they lacked fetal liver hematopoiesis, indicating that Runx1 is required for definitive hematopoiesis (3Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). Runx3 functions as a tumor suppressor of gastric cancer. Runx3-null gastric mucosa develops hyperplasia because of the activation of proliferation and suppression of apoptosis in epithelial cells. Runx3-null gastric epithelial cells are less sensitive to the growth-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing activities of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). 2The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; HDAC, histone deacetylase; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein-2; OC, osteocalcin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HA, hemagglutinin; Smurf1, Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1; TSA, Tricostatin A; ALP, alkaline phosphatase; RT, reverse transcriptase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CMV, cytomegalovirus. Thus, Runx3 is a major growth regulator of gastric epithelial cells. Previously, we showed that the extent of the Runx3 acetylation is up-regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway and down-regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities (4Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L.

The p300 protein functions primarily as a co-activator of transcription for a number of nuclear proteins including Runx family members (21Lill N.L. Grossman S.R. Ginsberg D. DeCaprio J.

Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Acetylation of specific lysine residues on histone tails is believed to neutralize the positive charge, and to generate a more accessible chromatin structure for transcription factors (26Wolffe A.P. Pruss D. Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). p300 is also capable of acetylating a number of non-histone proteins (27Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). For example, E2F1 is acetylated by p300, and the acetylation is reversed by histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), indicating that reversible acetylation is also a mechanism for regulation of non-histone proteins (28Marzio G. Wagener C. Gutierrez M.I. Cartwright P. Helin K. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10887-10892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The increase in half-life through acetylation appears to protect the protein from ubiquitination, since acetylation and ubiquitination occur only at lysine residues (29Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H.

Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitination at lysine residues plays a crucial role in defining substrate specificity and subsequent protein degradation by proteasome. Runx2 is degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated pathway (31Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito K. Wee H.J. Yokomizo T. Ito Y.

Recently, Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1) was identified as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitin-dependent Runx2 degradation (4Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L. Lee Y.H. Choi J.K.

Overexpression of Smurf1 in osteoblast precursor cells inhibits BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation (34Zhao M. Qiao M. Harris S.E. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol.

Consistent with these findings, targeted inactivation of Smurf1 resulted in enhanced bone formation (35Yamashita M. Ying S.X. Zhang G.M. Li C. Cheng S.Y. Deng C.X. Zhang Y.E.

In contrast, HDAC4-null mice displayed premature ossification of developing bones, mimicking the phenotype that results from constitutive Runx2 expression.

A recent study demonstrated that HDAC4 or- 5 is required to inhibit Runx2 function (39Kang J.S. Alliston T. Delston R. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), suggesting that HDAC4 is a physiological repressor of Runx2. Although these results clearly demonstrate that Smurf and HDAC play opposing roles in BMP signaling of Runx2 regulation, the underlying molecular links have not been clearly defined. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism that mediates HDAC and Smurf1 effects on Runx2. Our finding that BMP-2 induces Runx2 acetylation furnishes for the first time an important molecular link between four factors involved in osteogenesis, BMP-2, Runx2, HDAC, and Smurf1, and provides one mechanism that assembles a great deal of previously unconnected data into one coherent model. Cell Culture—All cell culture media and antibiotics were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). C2C12 and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and anti-mycotics, at 37 °C, in 5% CO2. Runx2–/– cell line (H1–127-21-2) was established from calvaria-like tissue of Runx2 knock-out mouse and maintained in α-MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). C2C12 cells were used for the analysis, which required intact BMP signaling pathway. Runx2–/– cell line was used when discrimination of Runx2-specific response from nonspecific response was required. 293 cells were used when high transfection efficiency was required and intact BMP signaling pathway was not required. Plasmids and Antibodies—The Runx2 full-length type I isoform with MRIPV N-terminal sequence (Q08775-3) and its deletion mutants were tagged with Myc or HA, in a CMV promoter-derived mammalian expression vector (pCS4–3Myc and pCS4–3HA, respectively). Mutations affecting the Runx2 acetylation site were introduced by PCR and cloned into the pCS4–3Myc vectors. The BMP receptor 1 (BMPR1) and HA-p300 expression vectors were obtained from Dr. K. Miyazono (Tokyo University) and Dr. M. Ewen (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively. The expression plasmids for the Myc-HDAC series were cloned into pCS4–3Myc. The luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-TβRE, which contains two copies of TβRE (originally identified in the immunoglobulin Cα promoter (40Shi M.J. Stavnezer J. J.

In this study, antibodies against acetyl-lysine (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and HA (12CA5, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were used. The anti-Runx2 monoclonal antibody (Runx2–865) was obtained by immunizing a mouse with a Runx2 polypeptide (amino acids 272-362). DNA Transfections and Reporter Assay—Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method for 293 cells or Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) for the Runx2–/– cell line. Luciferase assays were performed using the Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The pCMV β-gal plasmid was included as an internal control to determine the efficiency of transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Following transfection, the C2C12 and 293 cells were lysed in ice-cold MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and cleared by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, and protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. All incubations were conducted at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed extensively and bound proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.

After washing, the reactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences). For HDAC inhibitor treatments, both C2C12 and 293 cells were cultured in fresh medium for 1 day following transfection, and then treated with the inhibitors (Tricostatin A (TSA), CHAP27 [cyclo(-LAsu(NHOH)-DPhe-LPhe-DPro)] (43Komatsu Y.

In Vivo Sodium [3H]Acetate Labeling—The 293 cells (2 × 106 cells) were incubated for 90 min in 4 ml of medium containing 4 mCi of sodium [3H]acetate (3.1 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 50 nm Trichostatin A. The cells were lysed in MLB buffer, and the protein extract was incubated with anti-Myc antibody. The antibody complex was then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose. Precipitates were washed four times with MLB buffer, separated using SDS-PAGE, fixed, enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to x-ray film at –70 °C for 10 days. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—One day prior to transfection, 293 cells (3 × 105 cells per well) were plated in 6-well plates and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of antibiotics. Cells were transfected with pCS4–3Myc-Runx2. Five hours post-transfection, a second transfection was performed with 20 μm Smad1 siRNA and Smad5 siRNA (Invitrogen), HDAC4 siRNA, and HDAC5 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). pCS4–3Myc-Runx2 and siRNA were transfected using Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. A commercially available nonspecific random siRNA was used as a control. Cells were harvested 48 h after the second transfection, and subjected to immunoblot analysis and RT-PCR. Mouse Calvarial Organ Culture—Neonatal calvarial bones were obtained from 4-day-old pups of ICR mice and analysis of new bone formation was performed as described by Ref. 45Garrett I.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 183-198PubMed Google Scholar. The amount of new bone formation was assessed morphologically using the Bioquant Nova Prime software (Nashville, TN). BMP-2 Increases Runx2 Protein Levels via a Transcription-independent Mechanism—The pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12 provides a model system to study the early stage of osteoblast differentiation during bone formation. In this model, BMP-2 inhibits the differentiation of C2C12 into multinucleated myotubes and induces osteoblast differentiation (46Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Komaki M. Abe E. Takahashi N. Ikeda T. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Fujisawa-Sehara A. Suda T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1755-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Runx2 is a major target of the BMP-2 signaling pathway at the transcriptional level (15Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y. Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). To address whether BMP-2 regulates Runx2 post-translationally as well, C2C12 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged Runx2, in the presence or absence of BMP-2, and the protein levels were compared by immunoblotting. The level of exogenously expressed Runx2 was much higher in BMP-2-treated cells (Fig. 1A). This result was confirmed by coexpression of HA-tagged Runx2 and increasing amounts of the BMP receptor 1 (BMPR1). Runx2 levels increased in proportion to the abundance of BMPR1 (Fig. 1B). The half-life of Runx2 was ∼5.3 h in the absence of BMPR1 and extended to 50.2 h in the presence of BMPR1 (Fig. 1, C and D). To eliminate the possibility of BMP-2 mediated transcriptional activation of the transfected gene, we measured mRNA levels of exogenous and endogenous Runx2, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Although BMP-2 increased the level of endogenous Runx2 mRNA, the exogenous level was not affected (Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggest that, in response to BMP-2 signaling, the accumulation of exogenous Runx2 is independent of the increase in transcription, but is associated with increased stability. BMP-2-mediated Runx2 Acetylation and Stabilization—Because Runx2 and Runx3 are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway (4Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L. Lee Y.H. Choi J.K. Kim W.J. Lee K.Y.

Immunoblot analysis of BMP-2-transfected cells revealed that Runx2 is acetylated by BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 2A). Because p300 is associated with TGF-β superfamily signaling pathways, and Runx1 and Runx3 are targets for p300 acetyltransferase activity (4Jin Y.H. Jeon E.J. Li Q.L. Lee Y.H. Choi J.K. Kim W.J.

Cell. 2002; 10: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we examined whether p300 is associated with BMP-2-mediated Runx2 acetylation. p300-acetylated Runx2, and p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation increased in the presence of BMP-2 (Fig. 2A, top panel). Notably, the total amount of exogenous Runx2 was proportional to acetylation levels (Fig. 2A, third panel). Similarly, overexpression of BMPR1 alone, or in combination with p300, resulted in an increase in Runx2 acetylation and an accumulation of the protein (Fig. 2, B and C). Transcription of exogenous Runx2 was unchanged by p300 and/or BMP-2 (Fig. 1E). Confirmation of Runx2 acetylation by p300 and BMP-2 was provided using 293 cells, in which Runx2 was metabolically labeled with [3H]acetate. Acetylation of Runx2 increased when p300 was overexpressed and further increased in response to BMP-2 treatment (Fig. 2D). To determine whether endogenous Runx2 is acetylated by p300, C2C12 cells were transfected with p300 expression plasmid and the acetylation status of Runx2 was assessed. Overexpression of p300 increased endogenous Runx2 acetylation and total Runx2 levels (Fig. 2E). These results demonstrate that the BMP-2 signaling pathway stimulates p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation, thereby promoting Runx2 accumulation. Smad Is Required for p300-mediated Runx2 Acetylation—To understand how BMP-2 stimulates p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation, we transfected 293 cells with Smads and Runx2 expression plasmids and examined Runx2 acetylation. Smad2, -4, and -5 strongly increased, and Smad1 and -3 weakly increased, the level of Runx2 acetylation (Fig. 3A). Because Smad1 and Smad5 are known mediators of BMP-2 signaling, we examined the effect of Smad1 and Smad5 siRNA on p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation. siRNA knock-down of Smad1 and Smad5 was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, B and C). The level of Runx2 acetylation was weakly decreased by Smad1 siRNA and strongly decreased by Smad5 siRNA. Combined Smad1 and Smad5 siRNA treatment further decreased Runx2 acetylation (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, coexpression of Smad5 and BMPRI synergistically increased Runx2 acetylation (Fig. 3E), suggesting that Smads mediate Runx2 acetylation in response to BMP-2. To determine the specific role of Smads in Runx2 acetylation, Smad1 and Smad5 were overexpressed in 293 cells. The physical interaction between Runx2 and p300 increased when Smad1 or Smad5 were overexpressed (Fig. 3F). Notably, Smad5 more effectively helped the interaction than Smad1. The correlation between the effect of Smad1 and Smad5 on Runx2 acetylation and the Runx2-p300 interaction suggests that BMP-2-activated Smads (mainly Smad5) stimulate p300-mediated Runx2 acetylation by facilitating the interaction between Runx2 and p300. Acetylation Protects Runx2 from Smurf1-mediated Degradation—Runx2 contains ten lysine residues that are potential acetylation sites (Fig. 4A). To identify which residues are targets for acetylation, a series of Runx2 deletion mutants were co-expressed with p300, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Acetylation was detected in the central and C-terminal regions of Runx2 (data not shown). To identify the acetylated residues, various Runx2 mutants with lysine-to-arginine (KR) substitutions were examined for p300-dependent acetylation. The Runx2-KR-225/230/350/351 mutant removed virtually all Runx2 acetylation by p300 (Fig. 4B). Using this mutant, we examined whether acetylation is responsible for stabilization of the protein. Runx2 had a half-life of ∼5 h, but became very stable when co-expressed with p300 (half-life > 24 h) (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the Runx2-KR-225/230/350/351 mutant was extremely stable, even in the absence of p300 (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that the presence of unmodified lysine residues increases the susceptibility of the protein to degradation, and that acetylation of the lysine residues protects Runx2 from degradation. Because Runx2 is degraded through the ubiquitin-mediated pathway and Smurf1 is the ubiquitin ligase for this pathway (33Zhao M. Qia"
https://openalex.org/W2028984447,"A guiding hypothesis for cell-cycle regulation asserts that regulated proteolysis constrains the directionality of certain cell-cycle transitions. Here we test this hypothesis for mitotic exit, which is regulated by degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activator, cyclin B. Application of chemical Cdk1 inhibitors to cells in mitosis induces cytokinesis and other normal aspects of mitotic exit, including cyclin B degradation. However, chromatid segregation fails, resulting in entrapment of chromatin in the midbody. If cyclin B degradation is blocked with a proteasome inhibitor or by expression of non-degradable cyclin B, Cdk inhibitors will nonetheless induce mitotic exit and cytokinesis. However, if after mitotic exit, the Cdk1 inhibitor is washed free from cells in which cyclin B degradation is blocked, the cells can revert back to M phase. This reversal is characterized by chromosome recondensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, assembly of microtubules into a mitotic spindle, and in most cases, dissolution of the midbody, reopening of the cleavage furrow, and realignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate. These findings demonstrate that proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin B provides directionality for the M phase to G1 transition."

The cytosolic enzyme cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) 3The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; PDB, Protein Data Bank; QDO, quercetin dioxygenase. 3The abbreviations used are: CDO, cysteine dioxygenase; SAD, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction; PDB, Protein Data Bank; QDO, quercetin dioxygenase. (EC 1.13.11.20) catalyzes the irreversible oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinate (Reaction 1). This reaction is required for a variety of critical metabolic pathways (1Stipanuk M.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 539-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). CDO initiates the catabolism of cysteine to pyruvate and sulfate, which is essential for the provision of adequate inorganic sulfate and allows pyruvate to enter central pathways of metabolism. Also, the oxidation and excretion of the sulfur of methionine depends on CDO, because the sulfur atoms of methionine and homocysteine are only oxidized after their transfer, via the transsulfuration pathway, to serine to yield cysteine. In addition, CDO activity is essential for the biosynthesis of taurine, which is formed by the decarboxylation of cysteine sulfinate to hypotaurine and further oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine. Clinical evidence indicates that a block in cysteine catabolism, thought to be at CDO, leads to an altered cysteine to sulfate ratio that is associated with sulfate depletion and other adverse effects (1Stipanuk M.H. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 539-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The prevalence of impaired cysteine catabolism has been reported to be increased in patient populations afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, liver diseases, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, motor neuron disease, and systemic lupus erythematosus (2Heafield M.T.

These patients frequently exhibit low levels of sulfate in plasma (and in synovial fluid), elevated fasting plasma cysteine concentrations, elevated plasma cysteine to sulfate ratios, and an impaired capacity for sulfation reactions in vivo. Reduced cysteine catabolism would cause both depletion of the products sulfate and taurine and an accumulation of the substrate cysteine, either of which would lead to adverse effects. Large doses of cysteine or cystine have been shown to be toxic in several species (6Pedersen O.O. Karlsen R.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1980; 19: 886-892PubMed Google Scholar, 7Karlsen R.L.

Res. 1996; 21: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cysteine is thought to be neuroexcitotoxic, acting via effects on glutamate transport by systems mathrmXC− and mathrmXAG− and on the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor (9McBean G.J. Flynn J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schubert D. Piasecki D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7455-7462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cysteine can form toxins by reacting with other compounds (11Li H. Dryhurst G. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1530-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Taurine status is associated with sulfur amino acid intake and thus with its synthesis from cysteine, and a lack of adequate taurine has been associated with a number of abnormalities, most commonly with dilated cardiomyopathy, impaired neurological development, and retinal photoreceptor cell abnormalities and photoreceptor cell death (12Huxtable R.J. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 101-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). CDO was first described by Ewetz and Sorbo (13Ewetz L. Sorbo B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), who postulated that it might be a mixed function oxidase. Subsequently, Lombardini et al. (14Lombardini J.B. Singer T.P. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1172-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the enzyme was a dioxygenase and did not require NAD(P)H as an electron donor. CDO was purified from rat liver by Yamaguchi et al. (15Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Kori Y. Sakakibara S. Ueda I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 83: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), who showed it to have a high specificity for cysteine as compared with various cysteine analogs. Little additional work had been done to further characterize the structure or catalytic mechanism of CDO until our recent purification of catalytically active recombinant CDO with kinetic properties that match those observed for CDO in rat liver homogenates: a Km for cysteine of 0.45 mm, a requirement for ferrous ions, and a pH optimum of 6.1 (16Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S. Stipanuk M.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 47: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study also demonstrated that recombinant CDO is expressed as both active and inactive isoforms, indicating that significant attention to isolation of the active species would be necessary for structural studies. The function of CDO has been studied most thoroughly in mammals, where it is expressed primarily in liver hepatocytes (17Hirschberger L.L. Daval S. Stover P.J. Stipanuk M.H.

Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 117-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the rat and mouse, CDO is expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, but CDO abundance in tissues where it is expressed is regulated largely, if not entirely, by cysteine-mediated regulation of CDO degradation (20Dominy J.E.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The reaction catalyzed by CDO is notably different from those catalyzed by other classes of dioxygenases that have been studied. First, cysteine dioxygenation involves the oxidation of a sulfhydryl group rather than cleavage of a C-C bond or hydroxylation of a carbon atom, and second, both oxygen atoms from the oxygen molecule are transferred to a single sulfur atom rather than distributed between two carbon atoms. These other classes of dioxygenases are: (i) the Fe(II)-containing vicinal oxygen chelate or type I extradiol dioxygenases that catalyze aromatic ring cleavage of catechols at a C-C bond adjacent to an ortho-hydroxyl substituent; (ii) the Fe(II)/Fe-S-center-containing Rieske dioxygenases that catalyze the cis-hydroxylation of an arene double bond; (iii) the Fe(III)-containing intradiol dioxygenases that cleave aromatic rings between two carbons that each bear a hydroxyl group; (iv) several transition metal-dependent dioxygenases that belong to the cupin superfamily and cleave C-C bonds; and (v) the α-ketoglutarate-dependent Fe(II) dioxygenases (hydroxylases), many of which have also been described as cupins, that couple the oxidative decomposition of α-ketoglutarate to the hydroxylation of a cosubstrate. Mammalian CDO was assigned to the cupin superfamily (24Dunwell J.M. Khuri Sawsan Gane P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) by the presence of two short but partially conserved sequence motifs, GX5HXHX3-6EX6G and GX5-7PXGX2HX3N, that are separated by 29 residues. Proteins in the cupin family have a wide range of enzymatic and biological functions and often show very low overall sequence similarity but share a canonical cupin “jelly roll” β-barrel (25Dunwell J.M. Culham A. Carter C.E. Sosa-Aguirre C.R. Goodenough P.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 740-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Determined as part of a structural genomics effort, the recently reported structure of recombinant Mus musculus CDO-1 (26McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr. G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To give mechanistic work on CDO a firm foundation, we independently initiated crystallographic studies of recombinant Rattus norvegicus CDO (identical in sequence to mouse CDO). Here, we describe structures at 1.5-Å resolution of both the native iron-containing CDO and a substrate-inhibited complex. The observed iron metallocenter geometry is distinct from that of the nickel center reported for the mouse CDO structure, and this has major ramifications for mechanistic proposals. The active site geometry reported here provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in thiol dioxygenation and sets the stage for exploring the chemistry of this new type of mononuclear iron center. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of CDO—Native R. norvegicus cysteine dioxygenase (SwissProt/TrEMBL P21816) was prepared as described previously (27Simmons C.R. Hao Q. Stipanuk M.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The purified protein used for crystallization had a kcat of ∼43 min-1 and a Km of 0.45 mm for l-cysteine when assayed in the presence of ferrous ions (16Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S.

Inhibition of bacterial methionine biosynthesis was targeted by the addition of lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine at 100 mg/liter each, isoleucine, leucine, and valine at 50 mg/liter, and Se-Met at 60 mg/liter. After 15 min, the expression of CDO was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cells were incubated at 25 °C overnight. The cells were harvested via centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Cell lysis and protein purification were performed as described for native CDO (16Simmons C.R. Hirschberger L.L. Machi M.S.

F. 2005; 61: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in sitting drops at 25 °C using a reservoir of 0.1-0.25 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m tri-sodium citrate, pH 5.6, with 22-26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 (28Doublié S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Equivalent crystals could also be grown using a reservoir of 0.15 m ammonium sulfate, 0.2 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, with 26% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and the co-crystal with 5 mm cysteine were grown under these conditions. In all crystallization setups 1.5 μl of concentrated protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Cryomounting of CDO crystals was done as described previously (27Simmons C.R. Hao Q. Stipanuk M.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Data Collection—Crystallographic data collection of native CDO crystals was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source X12b beamline on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector as reported elsewhere (27Simmons C.R. Hao Q. Stipanuk M.H. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data on cryo-cooled Se-Met CDO crystals were collected at the selenium K-edge (peak) at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source F2 station using an ADSC Q210 CCD detector. The x-ray wavelength was set at 0.9790 Å based on a fluorescence scan. A total of 360 1° frames (180 + 180 by inverse beam geometry with 5° wedges) were recorded from one crystal. Diffraction data from frozen CDO-cysteine co-crystals were also collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source F2 station. All data were reduced using the HKL package (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38432) Google Scholar); the data quality statistics are summarized in Table 1. All CDO crystals used in this study were isomorphous, belonging to space group P43212.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statistics NSLS, National Synchrotron Light Source; CHESS, Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source; NA, not applicable; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.NativeSe-MetCys co-crystalData collection Experimental stationNSLS X12bCHESS F2CHESS F2 X-ray wavelength (Å)1.00.97900.9790 Exposure time (s)301520 Oscillation range (°)1.01.01.0 Cell dimensions (Å)a = b = 57.55, c = 123.06a = b = 57.49, c = 122.27a = b = 57.48, c = 122.80 Space groupP43212P43212P43212 Resolution (Å)1Values in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell30–1.50 (1.55-1.50)30–1.80 (1.86-1.80)30–1.50 (1.53-1.5) Unique reflections334531986532390 Multiplicity13.117.813.8 I/σ52.4 (7.0)31.8 (8.6)25.1 (1.4) Rsym (%)4.6 (31.8)8.7 (46.9)8.4 (71.3) Completeness (%)98.2 (95.8)100.0 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)Refinement R (%)/Rfree (%)18.0/20.8NA19.6/22.3 r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.02NA0.01 r.m.s.d. angles (°)2.06NA1.93a Values in parentheses are from the highest resolution shell Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The CDO structures were solved by SAD phasing. Four Se sites were located using the SAPI program (30Hao Q. Gu Y.X. Yao J.Y. Zheng C.D. Fan H.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1274-1276Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The correct space group, P43212, was selected by using the program ABS (31Hao Q. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 498-499Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) based on the four Se sites and SAD data to 3.0-Å resolution. The Se substructure was then fed into the program SOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) for refinement and phase calculation, resulting in an average figure of merit of 0.43 for all reflections between 20 and 2.3 Å. Combined with the native data set, the 2.3-Å SAD phases were gradually extended to 1.5 Å by solvent flipping implemented in the program SOLOMON (33Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), and an initial model accounting for 97% of the structure (r = 19.2 Rfree = 28.0) was automatically built with ArpWarp (34Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Manual model building was performed in O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar), alternating with crystallographic refinement using CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) software (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16944) Google Scholar) until final completion of the model. Rfree calculations were based on 10% of the reflections. During further refinement, water molecules were added in places with difference density >3.5 rrms, 2Fo - Fc density >1.0 rrms and having a reasonable environment. A close approach of Cys93-Sγ to Tyr157-Cϵ2 indicated the presence of a covalent link, and this led us to loosely restrain it to a bond length of 1.93 Å (based on an Sδ-Cϵ bond distance of methionine). Refinement was terminated when the remaining significant difference peaks were associated with alternate conformations of some water sites and of a few disordered side chains that were not near the active site (His20 and Val36). When refinement was complete, water molecules were numbered based on electron density strength, with Wat1 having the strongest density and Wat339 the weakest. The structure of the CDO-cysteine co-crystal was solved by difference Fourier, using as the initial model the final native CDO structure with active site waters removed. Clear movements indicated for the side chains of Arg60, Cys164, and Met179 and the backbone near Cys164 were accounted for manually, but solvent structure in the active site pocket and the density for a molecule apparently covalently attached to Cys164 were initially left uninterpreted. As refinement progressed, it became apparent that the active site was a mixture of a minor component indistinguishable from the native structure and a major component having Cys164 in an apparent disulfide link with an unknown ligand. Given this mixture, we decided to model the residual active site density (including the disulfide-linked sulfur site) as a series of water sites at the significant density maxima even though these sites were in some cases too close to each other and to protein atoms. These waters are numbered 401-428. Some residual density for the original native positions of Met179 and Arg60 remained. Final statistics for both refined models are given in Table 1. Coordinates—The atomic coordinates and structure factors of native CDO and the CDO-cysteine co-crystal have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 2B5H and 2GH2, respectively. Overall Structure of CDO—The crystal structure of R. norvegicus CDO, solved by SAD phasing using Se-Met-substituted protein, yielded a final refined model with r = 18.0 and Rfree = 20.8 at 1.5-Å resolution. A total of 186 of the 200 residues in the protein (residues 5-190) were well defined in the electron density map (Fig. 1) and are included in the final model. No non-Gly residues have outlier ϕ,Ψ angles, and there is one cis-peptide preceding Pro159. The structure as a whole is highly similar to that of murine CDO (PDB accession code 2ATF; 100% sequence identity; root-mean-square deviation = 0.2 Å), including the cysteinyl-tyrosine linkage (Fig. 1). The only salient difference involves the metallocenter, as further discussed below. Briefly, the overall structure of CDO consists of a small α-helical domain containing three α-helices near the N terminus followed by 13 β-strands subdivided into a main β-sandwich domain and two β-hair-pins at the C terminus (Fig. 2). A short 310 helix is observed between β1 and β2. The entire β-sandwich is composed of seven anti-parallel β-strands (β1, β2, β4, β7, β9, β12, and β13) on the lower side and six anti-parallel β-strands (β3, β5, β6, β8, β10, and β11) on the upper side. N-terminal helices pack against the outside of the lower face of the sandwich to build a second non-polar core. Alignment of CDO sequences across multiple species reveals that the elements of secondary structure seen in the core β-sandwich of rat CDO are conserved in other CDOs, with all insertions and deletions occurring between the secondary structural elements (Fig. 3). In contrast, the C-terminal β-hairpins may be dispensable. The sequence alignment also reveals notably strong conservation of 18 residues (yellow in Fig. 3). Among these, 14 are present in the active site area, and their roles will be discussed below. The remaining four residues are likely important for structural reasons: Gly100 at the end of cupin motif 1 at a corner of the β-sandwich has a Gly-specific conformation of ϕ,Ψ = (+85, -157); Asn144, the terminal residue of cupin motif 2, is fully buried, stabilizing a loop spanning residues 144-150 by hydrogen bonding to three backbone groups (Ser146-N, Gly78-O, and Glu149-O) and a water molecule; Asn61 is fully buried and hydrogen bonds to Ser183-Oγ, Thr59-Oγ and the Ile74-O, apparently significant for formation of the zigzag chain path of segment 180-188 that contains two of the metal ligands; and Asn67, with ϕ,Ψ = (+55, +28), is in a G-N-G tripeptide with each residue in the α-L conformation, creating a short left-handed 310 helix. CDO Active Site—The CDO active site is identified by the mononuclear iron center that is fully occupied and is coordinated via a roughly tetrahedral geometry by the conserved residues His86, His88, His140 and the water molecule Wat4 (Figs. 1 and 4A). The B-factors for the iron (12 Å2) and Wat4 (10 Å2) are similar to those of the coordinating His residues (11-14 Å2), indicating full occupancy of the metal and no heterogeneity in the coordination geometry. The metallocenter is located in the central portion of the cupin β-sandwich (Fig. 2), consistent with what has been observed in other cupin structures. This metallocenter geometry appears different from the hexacoordinated Ni(II) center seen in the M. musculus CDO structure (26McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr. G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), but the difference can be seen simply to involve the additional presence in M. musculus CDO of two waters with long coordination distances (Fig. 4B). However, although geometrically small, this difference has major ramifications for mechanistic proposals (see “Discussion”). The iron is roughly 8 Å away from the protein surface and is surrounded by a solvent-filled pocket that connects to bulk solvent (Fig. 5). The remaining 14 conserved residues not mentioned above are all associated with the active site pocket, either lining it or adjacent to it (Fig. 5). Conspicuous among the conserved residues within the substrate binding pocket is Tyr157. Tyr157-OH forms a short (2.6 Å) hydrogen bond with Wat4, and as observed previously by McCoy et al. (26McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips Jr. G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), very clear electron density shows that Cys93-Sγ is covalently bonded to Tyr157-Cϵ2 forming a cysteinyl-tyrosine linkage (Fig. 1). That Cys93-Sγ and Cys93-Cβ are roughly coplanar with the aromatic ring of Tyr157 indicates that the Cys93-Sγ to Tyr157-Cϵ2 bond has partial double bond character. This geometry was first observed by Ito et al. (37Ito N. Phillips S.E. Stevens C. Ogel Z.B. McPherson M.J. Keen J.N. Yadav K.D. Knowles P.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) in galactose oxidase and more recently by Schnell et al. (38Schnell R. Sandalova T. Hellman U. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27319-27328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in NirA, a sulfite reductase. These are the only other structurally known examples of proteins containing a cysteinyl-tyrosine linkage. Additional highly conserved residues directly lining the active site include Tyr58, Arg60, Ser153, and His155 (Fig. 6). Tyr58 and Arg60 H-bond to waters in the active site and are thus well positioned to be directly involved in substrate coordination/catalysis. Ser153-Oγ H-bonds to His155-Nϵ2 (2.68 Å), and His155-Nδ2 H-bonds to Tyr157-OH (2.69 Å), forming a Ser153·His155·Tyr157 triad reminiscent of the Asp·His·Ser catalytic triad in chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (39Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 40Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The conservation of Leu154, buried in a neighboring aliphatic pocket, and cis-Pro159-Pro160, located in a loop between β9 and β10, would seem related to ensuring accurate positioning of this triad of residues. Similarly, the conservation of Ser83, which H-bonds to the backbone NH of residue 142 (very close to the metal ligand His140), and Phe167, packed behind the main chain containing the metal ligands His86 and His88, may play a role in maintaining the integrity of the metallocenter. In addition, Asp87 is positioned between the iron-coordinating residues His86 and His88, and the Asp87 carboxylate interacts electrostatically with Asp87-N and Thr89-N, maintaining the position of the iron ligands, as well as with the backbone and side chain of His165 in the neighboring β-strand that contributes to the active site. Other residues that provide a non-polar lining to the active site pocket are Leu75, Trp77,Val142, Phe161, Cys164, Val177, and Met179. Overall, the pocket corresponds reasonably well to the space that would be required for a single molecule of cysteine. In addition to this main pocket, there is a smaller pocket located behind Wat4 immediately adjacent to Cys9"

In the present study, we investigated the role of Nrf2 in the regulation of osteoblastic differentiation. nrf2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated in femur isolated from ovariectomized mice, whereas in situ hybridization analysis revealed that up-regulation of nrf2 mRNA was mainly found in osteoblasts attached on cancellous bone in femur of ovariectomized mice. Expression of Nrf2 protein was also seen in osteoblasts in neonatal mouse tibia and calvaria. In osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nrf2 expression vector, significant inhibition was seen in the maturation-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase activity as well as the mineralized matrix formation. Stable overexpression of nrf2 significantly impaired Runx2 (runt-related transcription factor 2)-dependent stimulation of osteocalcin promoter activity and recruitment of Runx2 on osteocalcin promoter without affecting the expression of runx2 mRNA. Coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian two-hybrid assay revealed a physical interaction between Runx2 and Nrf2, whereas cellular distribution of endogenous Runx2 was not apparently changed by nrf2 overexpression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Alternatively, Nrf2 bound to antioxidant-responsive element-like-2 sequence of osteocalcin promoter. The inhibition by nrf2 on runx2-dependent osteocalcin promoter activity was partially prevented by the introduction of reporter of deletion mutant for ARE-like-2 sequence of osteocalcin promoter.

In bone tissues, both formation and maintenance are sophisticatedly regulated by bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). The osteoblast lineage is derived from primitive multipotent mesenchymal stem cells with potentiality to differentiate into bone marrow stromal cells, chondrocytes, muscles, and adipocytes (4Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), whereas osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from the fusion of mononuclear hematopoietic precursors (3Teitelbaum S.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (3083) Google Scholar). The development and differentiation of these two distinct cells are under tight regulation by a number of endogenous substances. These include growth factors, cytokines, and hormones, which are individually secreted through endocrine, paracrine/autocrine, and neurocrine systems essential for the delicate balancing between bone formation and resorption by the two different cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. An imbalance between these two cells leads to pathogenesis and etiology of certain bone metabolic diseases, including osteoporosis and osteopetrosis (5Chien K.R. Karsenty G.

In ovariectomized animals, osteoblast indices, such as osteoblast number and osteoblast surface, are increased, as revealed by histomorphometric analysis, in addition to the reduction of bone mineral density (8Lean J.M.

In mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone of ovariectomized mice, moreover, marked reduction of mRNA expression is seen for a variety of osteoblastic differentiation marker genes, including type I collagen and ALP, 2The abbreviations used are: ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; PPR, parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RT, reverse transcription; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. in addition to runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) (9Zhou S. Zilberman Y. Wassermann K. Bain S.D. Sadovsky Y. Gazit D. J. Cell Biochem. 2001; 81: 144-155Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar).

Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Runx2, a cell-specific member of the Runt family of transcription factors, plays a critical role in cellular differentiation processes in osteoblasts.

On the other hand, the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2 p45-related factor 2) has a highly conserved basic region-leucine zipper structure and belongs to the cap-n-collar family together with nuclear factor E2 p45, Nrf1, and Nrf3 (22Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Nrf2 forms heterodimers with the small Maf proteins for the selective recognition of antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) or electrophile-responsive element on target genes, followed by regulation of gene expression of phase II detoxifying enzymes as well as oxidative stress-inducible proteins in different tissues, including bone and cartilage (23Lee J.S.

Surh Y.J. Cancer Lett. 2005; 224: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y. Gordon G.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 885-893PubMed Google Scholar). However, little attention has been paid to a role other than gene transcription in response to oxidative stress of Nrf2 in osteoblasts. In the present study, therefore, we have investigated the role of Nrf2 in mechanisms underlying the regulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and maturation processes using osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nrf2 expression vector. Ovariectomy and Analysis of Skeletal Morphology—The protocol employed here meets the guidelines of the Japanese Society for Pharmacology and was approved by the Committee for Ethical Use of Experimental Animals at Kanazawa University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to utilize alternatives to in vivo techniques. Eight-week-old female ddY mice were subjected to ovariectomy or a sham operation. Mice were killed by decapitation 28 days after ovariectomy, followed by dissection of femora and tibiae and subsequent removal of adhering muscles around the bone for fixation with 70% ethanol. Bone mineral density of samples obtained at 28 days after operation was measured by single energy x-ray absorptiometry using a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600R; Aloka Co., Tokyo, Japan), whereas micro-CT scans were done using a composite x-ray analyzing system (NX-HCP; NS-ELEX Inc., Tokyo, Japan). RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured osteoblasts as described previously (25Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized with the oligo(dT) primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from extracted total RNA. PCR amplification was performed using specific primers, and PCR products were subcloned into a TA cloning vector (Promega) for determination of DNA sequences by ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Although results obtained using RT-PCR are by definition not quantitative, apparent quantitative PCR analysis was done at around 30 cycles with relatively high linearity using primers for the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase toward the possible comparative reference. PCR products were quantified by using a densitograph, followed by calculation of ratios of expression of mRNA for each gene over that for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. In Situ Hybridization Analysis—In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (26Wang L. Hinoi E. Takemori A. Takarada T. Yoneda Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 732-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, sections mounted were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by prehybridization with HCl, proteinase K, and triethanolamine/acetic anhydride treatment. Sections were then incubated with digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes at 65 °C for 16 h. The slides were treated with RNase A, blocked with 1.5% blocking buffer, incubated with anti-digoxigenin-AP-Fab fragments (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 16 h and treated with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for different periods. Antisense probes were used for detection of expression of particular mRNA, whereas sense probes were invariably employed to confirm the validity of cRNA probes. Immunohistochemistry—Neonatal mouse tibiae were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, followed by decalcification with 20% EDTA and subsequent immersion in 30% sucrose. Tibiae were then dissected for frozen sections with a thickness of 5 μm in a cryostat. Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by treatment with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol. After blocking with normal goat serum or bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100, sections were incubated with primary antibodies and subsequently with biotinylated secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Reagent (Vector Laboratories). Finally, immunostaining was done using 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide. Cell Cultures—MC3T3-E1 cells were purchased from RIKEN Cell Bank. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For differentiation induction, culture medium was replaced with α-minimal essential medium containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate. Culture medium was changed every 2–3 days. Establishment of Stable Transfectants—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2. After 24 h, they were stably transfected with pEF containing the full-length coding region of nrf2, which was kindly donated by Dr. J. Alam (Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA), or with the empty vector using 2 μg of DNA and Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 24 h, and every 48 h thereafter for 2 weeks, media were replaced with fresh media containing 600 μg/ml of G418 (Sigma). Pools of 15 clones of MC3T3-E1-nrf2 were isolated for further studies. Pools of clones between passages 2 and 5 were used for these experiments. Constructs and Luciferase Assay—A pHO15-luc (27Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Ellerbe M. Figueroa Y.G. Blank V. Beckman B.S.

Karsenty (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). A cyclin D1-luc (28D'Amico M. Wu K. Fu M. Rao M. Albanese C. Russell R.G. Lian H. Bregman D. White M.A. Pestell R.G. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4122-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Dr. R. G. Pestell (Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, D. C.). pcDNA3.1-runx2 was kindly provided by Dr. S. C. Bae (Chungbuk National University, Korea), and pCMV-runx2 was a generous gift from Dr. J. B. Lian (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Reporter vectors were co-transfected with a TK-Renilla luciferase construct in either the presence or absence of expression vectors into MC3T3-E1 and COS7 cells. Two days after transfection, cells were lysed for determination of luciferase activity using specific substrates in a luminometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized by determining the activity of Renilla luciferase. Determination of ALP Activity and Ca2+ Accumulation and Alizarin Red Staining—Determination of ALP activity and Ca2+ accumulation was done as described previously (25Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, osteoblasts were solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by determination of the ALP activity in lysates using p-nitrophenol phosphate as a substrate. Protein concentration was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The lysates solubilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 were also treated with hydrochloric acid for 16–24 h, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and subsequent determination of Ca2+ content in the supernatant using the C-TEST kit (Wako). Osteoblasts were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 2% Alizarin Red S (pH 4.0; Sigma) solution for Alizarin Red staining. Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation Assay—Cultured cells were treated with diluted bromodeoxyuridine labeling solution for 2 h at 37°C, followed by immunohistochemical staining using a bromodeoxyuridine staining kit (Zymed Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's directions. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—TUNEL staining was performed to detect apoptotic cells based on labeling of DNA strand breaks. Cultured cells were fixed with 10% formalin neutral buffer solution, followed by a TUNEL assay with the TUNEL detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP experiments were performed essentially following the protocol provided with the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) using MC3T3-E1 cells. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link and subsequently subjected to sonication in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Immunoprecipitation was performed with the anti-Runx2 antibody generously given by Dr. G. Karsenty, followed by extraction of DNA with phenol/chloroform. PCR was performed using the primers 5′-CTTGTCTCTAGGGCGACCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCATCCAGTAGCATTTATA-3′ in the promoter region of the mouse osteocalcin gene. Immunocytochemistry—Cultured cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by incubation with primary antibodies and subsequently with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine. Cells were then observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—MC3T3-E1 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, followed by incubation with an antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequent immunoprecipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Samples were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) and subsequent immunoblotting assay as described previously (29Hinoi E. Wang L. Takemori A. Yoneda Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—The mammalian two-hybrid vectors (Promega) (pBIND, encoding GAL4 DNA-BD fusion protein, and pACT, encoding VP16AD fusion protein) were co-transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pG5luc, carrying five GAL4-binding sites upstream of the TATA box, and the TK-Renilla luciferase construct. Cells were incubated for 2 days and subjected to a luciferase reporter assay. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Yeast cells were co-transfected with pGBKT7 vector, encoding GAL4 DNA-BD fused to the full-length nrf2 gene, and pGADT7 vector encoding GAL4-AD fused to the full-length runx2 gene. Co-transformed cells were further cultured on plates lacking leucine and tryptophan in either the presence or absence of histidine. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (25Hinoi E. Fujimori S. Yoneda Y. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1532-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and assays were carried out using 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotide sequences used were as follows: GST-Ya, 5′-CTAATGGTGACAAAGCAACTTTAG-3′; ARE-like-1, 5′-TCTCCTTCCAAGTTGACATAA-3′; ARE-like-2, 5′-CCACTGAGCACATGACCCC-3′; ARE-like-2 mutant, 5′-CCACTGCATGCGCGACCCC-3′. After determining protein contents, an aliquot of nuclear extracts was incubated at a fixed amount of 3 μg of protein with a radiolabeled probe and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed and dried, followed by exposure to x-ray films for different periods to obtain autoradiograms appropriate for subsequent quantification by a densitograph. Supershift analysis was carried out using the anti-Nrf2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Data Analysis—Results are all expressed as the mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined by the two-tailed and unpaired Students' t test or one-way analysis of variance with a Bonferroni/Dunnett post hoc test. Up-regulation of nrf2 Expression in Bone of Ovariectomized Mice—To examine whether or not Nrf2 signaling is altered in bone under pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis, we conducted ovariectomy in mice for subsequent investigation of the expression level of nrf2 mRNA in bone by semiquantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization analyses. Ovariectomy drastically decreased uterine weight at 28 days after operation without markedly affecting body weight at any days examined (data not shown). Ovariectomy induced a significant reduction of bone mineral density in both total tibia and total femur when determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at 28 days after operation (Fig. 1A). Bone loss was evident in cancellous bone (Fig. 1B), but not in cortical bone (data not shown), by micro-CT analysis. mRNA was extracted from femur after removing bone marrows by flush out, followed by determination of nrf2 expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR. nrf2 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by 3-fold in femur isolated from ovariectomized mice when compared with that in sham-operated mice (Fig. 1C). In addition, in situ hybridization analysis revealed that up-regulation of nrf2 mRNA was mainly found in osteoblasts attached on cancellous bone in femur of ovariectomized mice (Fig. 1D). The use of sense probe did not result in detectable expression of nrf2 mRNA in femoral cancellous bone at 28 days after operation (data not shown). Expression of Nrf2 in Bone and Osteoblasts—In order to evaluate the possible expression of Nrf2 protein in bone, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on sections dissected from both tibia and calvaria of neonatal mouse at 1 day old (P1), in addition to staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, which is an osteoclastic marker, and for ALP, which is an osteoblastic marker, respectively. Both tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and ALP staining clearly confirmed the presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in neonatal P1 mouse tibia, respectively (Fig. 2A). Upon immunohistochemical analysis, expression of parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor (PPR) protein was highly restricted to osteoblasts attaching on the cancellous bone surface, with similarly selective localization of Nrf2 protein in osteoblasts on the cancellous bone surface. The similar presence of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts was confirmed in neonatal P1 mouse calvaria, whereas in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the expression of type I collagen mRNA and Nrf2 protein by osteoblasts in parietal bone, respectively (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, Nrf2 protein was also detected in osteocytes embedded in bone in both trabecular and parietal sections. In sections not treated with a primary antibody, however, no marked immunoreactivity was detected for either Nrf2 or PPR (data not shown). The osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured for 3–28 days in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, followed by determination of the expression profile of each Nrf2/Maf signaling machinery by RT-PCR. Expression of mRNA was drastically increased for osteocalcin in cells cultured for 14–28 days, whereas expression of mRNA for type I collagen was gradually increased from 3 to 14 days with a plateau up to 28 days (Fig. 2C). By contrast, sustained expression was seen with runx2 mRNA for a period up to 28 days. Under these conditions, expression of nrf2 mRNA was gradually increased from 3 to 14 days with a gradual decrease thereafter up to 28 days. Although both mafF and mafG mRNA were constitutively expressed during cultivation from 3 to 28 days, no marked alteration was seen in their mRNA expression at all stages examined. Weak expression was seen with mafK mRNA throughout the culture period. Effect of nrf2 Overexpression on Osteoblastic Differentiation—To assess the role of Nrf2 in osteoblastic differentiation toward maturation, MC3T3-E1 cells were stably transfected with pEF containing the full-length coding region of nrf2 (MC3T3-E1-nrf2) or with the empty vector (MC3T3-E1-EV). The expression level of nrf2 was examined by semiquantitative RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and reporter assay analyses. Several clones of cells transfected with nrf2 expression vector showed markedly elevated expression of nrf2 compared with cells transfected with empty vector alone. Among different clones of MC3T3-E1 cells stably transfected with nrf2 expression vector, relatively high expression was seen in the clone(1) for mRNA (Fig. 3A, a) and corresponding protein (Fig. 3A, b) in addition to promoter activity of heme oxygenase-1 (Fig. 3A, c), which is a target gene of nrf2, with relatively low expression in the clone(2). To investigate whether Nrf2 indeed affects cell differentiation of osteoblasts, these transfected cells were cultured for 4–28 days in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate for determination of different cellular differentiation markers. In control MC3T3-E1-EV cells, ALP activities were increased in proportion to the duration of culture from 4 to 14 days with relatively high levels up to 28 days, whereas ALP activities were significantly inhibited in both MC3T3-E1-nrf2 clone(1) and clone(2) cells cultured for 14–28 days (Fig. 3B, a). Calcium accumulation was not detectable in immature cultured control cells up to 14 days with a marked increase proportional to the duration of culturing from 14 to 28 days, whereas Ca2+ accumulation was not detectable in both MC3T3-E1-nrf2 clone(1) and clone(2) cells at 14 days as seen in control cells, with a markedly delayed and slight increase from 21 to 28 days compared with MC3T3-E1-EV cells (Fig. 3B, b). In MC3T3-E1-nrf2 clone(1) with high nrf2 expression, inhibitory effects were more efficient on both ALP activity and Ca2+ accumulation than those in MC3T3-E1-nrf2 clone(2) with low nrf2 expression.

NO regulates normal bone remodeling and pathological bone loss in part through affecting the recruitment, formation, and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Using murine RAW 264.7 and primary bone marrow cells or osteoclasts formed from them by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) differentiation, we found that inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and NO generation were stimulated by interferon (IFN)-γ or lipopolysaccharide, but not by interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor-α. Surprisingly, iNOS expression and NO release were also triggered by RANKL. This response was time- and dose-dependent, required NF-κB activation and new protein synthesis, and was specifically blocked by the RANKL decoy receptor osteoprotegerin. Preventing RANKL-induced NO (via iNOS-selective inhibition or use of marrow cells from iNOS–/– mice) increased osteoclast formation and bone pit resorption, indicating that such NO normally restrains RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Additional studies suggested that RANKL-induced NO inhibition of osteoclast formation does not occur via NO activation of a cGMP pathway. Because IFN-β is also a RANKL-induced autocrine negative feedback inhibitor that limits osteoclastogenesis, we investigated whether IFN-β is involved in this novel RANKL/iNOS/NO autoregulatory pathway. IFN-β was induced by RANKL and stimulated iNOS expression and NO release, and a neutralizing antibody to IFN-β inhibited iNOS/NO elevation in response to RANKL, thereby enhancing osteoclast formation. Thus, RANKL-induced IFN-β triggers iNOS/NO as an important negative feedback signal during osteoclastogenesis. Specifically targeting this novel autoregulatory pathway may provide new therapeutic approaches to combat various osteolytic bone diseases.

Normal bone remodeling requires a homeostatic balance between the activities of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs). 3The abbreviations used are: OCs, osteoclasts; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB; RANKL, RANK ligand; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; OPG, osteoprotegerin; IFN, interferon; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; IL-1, interleukin-1; RAW-OCs, RAW cell-derived osteoclasts; WT, wild-type; MA-OCs, marrow cell-derived osteoclasts; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CM, conditioned medium; AG, aminoguanidine; l-NIL, l-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine hydrochloride; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PDTC, 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one; (Rp)-cGMP-S, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphorothioate (Rp isomer triethylammonium salt); 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase.3The abbreviations used are: OCs, osteoclasts; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RANK, receptor activator of NF-κB; RANKL, RANK ligand; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; OPG, osteoprotegerin; IFN, interferon; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; IL-1, interleukin-1; RAW-OCs, RAW cell-derived osteoclasts; WT, wild-type; MA-OCs, marrow cell-derived osteoclasts; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CM, conditioned medium; AG, aminoguanidine; l-NIL, l-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine hydrochloride; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PDTC, 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid; pAb, polyclonal antibody; ODQ, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one; (Rp)-cGMP-S, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphorothioate (Rp isomer triethylammonium salt); 8-pCPT-cGMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine 3′:5′-monophosphate; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Excessive OC bone resorption leads to bone loss in many skeletal pathologies such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, postmenopausal osteoporosis, implant osteolysis, and tumor-associated bone loss (1Heymann D. Fortun Y. Redini F. Padrines M. Drug Discovery Today. 2005; 10: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). OCs develop from hematopoietic precursors that fuse and differentiate into multinucleated bone-resorbing OCs in response to the essential tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family-related signal molecule receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL) in the presence of permissive levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) (2Lerner U. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Hofbauer L. Heufelder A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). RANKL expressed on the surface of osteoblasts, bone marrow stromal cells, or vascular endothelial cells or secreted by activated T cells directly engages a membrane receptor, RANK, on OC precursors and mature OCs to trigger multiple intracellular signaling cascades that stimulate OC gene expression, development, function, and survival (2Lerner U. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Hofbauer L. Heufelder A. J. Mol. Med. 2001; 79: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). RANKL/RANK interactions are specifically blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor released by osteoblast, stromal, vascular endothelial, and other cells that binds RANKL to inhibit OC formation and bone resorption in vivo and in vitro (2Lerner U. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2004; 15: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Hofbauer L. Heufelder A. J. Mol.

The RANKL/OPG ratio critically determines net effects on OC formation and bone resorption, and increases in this ratio due to various inflammatory or proresorptive stimuli have been shown to significantly contribute to pathological bone loss in multiple skeletal disorders. Interestingly, although clearly essential for promoting OC formation and activity, RANKL was found recently to also trigger an autocrine negative feedback pathway in OC precursors that ultimately limits the extent of osteoclastogenesis concurrently stimulated by RANKL (5Takayanagi H.

A deeper understanding of NO regulation and actions in bone is needed, especially as NO modulators are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as osteoprotective agents. Here, we report our unexpected discovery that OC precursor cells developing in response to RANKL up-regulate iNOS expression and NO release in a persistent manner. This RANKL-induced iNOS-derived NO functions as a negative feedback signal to limit osteoclastogenesis concurrently stimulated by RANKL. On the basis of such findings, we therefore further investigated whether RANKL-induced IFN-β might somehow interface with RANKL-induced NO in this novel autocrine inhibitory feedback pathway.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and OC Differentiation—Murine RAW 264.7 cells (3.5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, passaged, and differentiated into bone pit-resorbing OCs (RAW-OCs) by treatment with soluble recombinant murine RANKL (35 ng/ml, prepared in house, given daily with refeeding) for 4 days, similar to previous reports (31Yu X.

Primary bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from the long bones of 6–8-week-old female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) or iNOS–/– mice (stock no. 002609, The Jackson Laboratory), and the marrow cells from one mouse were placed into a 75-cm2 flask and cultured in phenol red-free α-minimal essential medium and 10% fetal bovine serum with recombinant human M-CSF (25 ng/ml; R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h. Nonadherent stroma-depleted cells were replated at 1.2 × 106 cells/well in 24-well plates and differentiated into bone pit-resorbing OCs (MA-OCs) by further treatment with M-CSF (25 ng/ml) and RANKL (50 ng/ml) given every other day with refeeding until day 7 or later when OCs had formed (31Yu X.

Cells were fixed, stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity as a marker of OC development, and co-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to label nuclei, and the number of TRAP+ mononuclear and multinucleated cells (three or more nuclei/cell) and the number of nuclei/TRAP+ cell were counted across a constant number of sequential random fields using an Olympus light fluorescence microscope (33Yu X.

RANKL preparations were screened for negligible levels of bacterial endotoxin contamination using a commercial LAL kit (Cambrex Corp., Walkersville, MD).Modulator Treatments—Recombinant murine IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-1α (all from R & D Systems); Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (both from Sigma); or the calcium ionophore A23187 (Calbiochem) was given to RAW cells or RAW-OCs formed by 4 days of RANKL treatment (as described above), and the cells and conditioned medium (CM) were harvested after 24 h for analysis of iNOS mRNA expression and NO release. To inhibit iNOS-derived NO generation during RANKL-induced OC development, RAW or marrow cells were cultured with various doses of the iNOS-selective inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG; Sigma) or l-N 6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine hydrochloride (l-NIL; ALEXIS Biochemicals Corp., San Diego, CA), each of which was freshly dissolved in warm medium just prior to administration on day 1 and given daily thereafter with refeeding until the harvest day noted in the figure legends. Similarly, RANKL-differentiating RAW or marrow cells were incubated with the NF-κB inhibitor 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic acid (PDTC; Sigma), IFN-β (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ), neutralizing rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) to IFN-β (PBL Biomedical Laboratories), control non-immune rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the RANKL inhibitor OPG (OPG-Fc fusion peptide; ALEXIS Biochemicals Corp.), the cGMP inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; Sigma), the cGMP-dependent G-protein kinase inhibitor (Rp)-cGMP-S (Sigma), or the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP (Sigma) for the times and conditions given in the figure legends. Thereafter, NO production, gene expression, OC development, and/or OC bone pit resorption activity was analyzed in harvested cell and CM samples.Nitrite Assay—CM was harvested from cultured cells, briefly centrifuged, and stored at –20 °C prior to assay. NO production was evaluated based on measuring nitrite as a stable end product of NO using the Griess reagent in a microplate assay (13Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L. Bekker S. Anderson F. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 474-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Results were normalized for cell protein using the BCA assay (Pierce), and data are expressed as μm nitrite accumulated in CM/mg of cell protein for the times noted in the figure legends.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) and quantified by spectrophotometry. Semiquantitative RT-PCR amplifications for murine iNOS, TRAP, matrix metalloproteinase-9, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor, IFN-α, IFN-β, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were performed using gene-specific oligonucleotide forward and reverse primers (Table 1), 5–200 ng of total RNA, and Ready-To-Go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (31Yu X. Huang Y. Collin-Osdoby P. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1404-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Optimal cycling conditions, linear amplification ranges, lack of genomic DNA contamination, and the sizes and sequences of amplified products were determined (31Yu X. Huang Y. Collin-Osdoby P. Osdoby P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1404-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). PCRs were conducted by initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min (TRAP, matrix metalloproteinase-9, cathepsin K, calcitonin receptor), 94 °C for 2 min (IFN-α, IFN-β), or 95 °C for 2 min (iNOS, GAPDH), followed by cycling as detailed in Table 1. Products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, photographed using Gel-Doc (Bio-Rad), and quantified by density determination using Quantity One image analysis software (Bio-Rad). Results were normalized to GAPDH signals determined in parallel for each sample, and data are expressed as a ratio of gene to GAPDH expression. All amplicons were of the expected size (Table 1), and products were directly sequenced using an ABI PRISM cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm identities by comparison with published sequences using computation performed at NCBI and the BLAST network service.TABLE 1Primers and conditions used for RT-PCR amplification of murine genesGeneForward and reverse primer sequences (5′-3′)Temperature cycling/final extension (cycle no.)Product sizeGenBank™ accession no.bpiNOSACGGAGAAGCTTAGATCTGGAGCAGAAGTG95 °C, 60 s; 55 °C, 90 s;654NM_010927CTGCAGGTTGGACCACTGGATCCTGCCGAT72 °C, 3 min/72 °C, 5 min (38)TRAPAAATCACTCTTTAAGACCAG94 °C, 60 s; 51 °C, 60 s;317BC019160TTATTGAATAGCAGTGACAG72 °C, 2 min/72 °C, 2 min (26)MMP-9aMMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; Cath-K, cathepsin K; CTR, calcitonin receptor.CTGTCCAGACCAAGGGTACAGCCT94 °C, 60 s; 51 °C, 60 s;383NM_013599GTGGTATAGTGGGACACATAGTGG72 °C, 2 min/72 °C, 2 min (27)Cath-KCCTCTCTTGGTGTCCATACA94 °C, 60 s; 51 °C, 60 s;490NM_007802ATCTCTCTGTACCCTCTGCA72 °C, 2 min/72 °C, 2 min (27)CTRACCGACGAGCAACGCCTACGC94 °C, 60 s; 51 °C, 60 s;272NM_007588GCCTTCACAGCCTTCAGGTAC72 °C, 2 min/72 °C, 2 min (38)IFN-αCTCATAACCTCAGGAACAAGAGAGCCT94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s;288AY220462.1GCATCAGACAGGCTTGCAGGTCATT72 °C, 60 s/72 °C, 5 min (34)IFN-βCTTCTCCACCACAGCCCTCTC94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s;346AY414518.1CCCACGTCAATCTTTCCTCTT72 °C, 60 s/72 °C, 5 min (34)GAPDHCACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTG95 °C, 60 s; 55 °C, 90 s;315BC020407ATGATGTTCTGGGCAGCCCC72 °C, 3 min/72 °C, 5 min (22)a MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; Cath-K, cathepsin K; CTR, calcitonin receptor. Open table in a new tab Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from RAW cells stimulated with RANKL (35 ng/ml, 10–40 min) using an NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (Pierce) as recommended by the supplier. A double-stranded consensus NF-κB-binding site oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) was radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a gel shift assay system kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) and incubated with nuclear extracts (5 μg) as recommended by the manufacturer. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels, and dried gels were exposed to Kodak film (at –80 °C). Signal specificity was confirmed by competition in parallel reactions with a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe.Western Blot Analysis—All extraction steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. RAW cells (107 cells/100-mm dish) were cultured with 35 ng/ml RANKL for various times and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracts were prepared by addition of a lysis solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and a 1:100 dilution of protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem) and freezing (–80 °C) overnight. Extracts were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min; protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay; and equal amounts (50 μg) of protein were loaded per lane on 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred using a semidry apparatus to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), blocked, probed overnight with rabbit pAb to iNOS (1:5000 dilution; BD Biosciences), reacted for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary pAb (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and bands were immunodetected by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star (Roche Applied Science) and exposure to Kodak film (34Wright L. Maloney W. Yu X. Kindle L. Collin-Osdoby P. Osdoby P. Bone. 2005; 36: 840-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Band densities on films were quantified using Quantity One software.Bone Pit Resorption Analysis—RAW cells or primary bone marrow mononuclear cells of WT or iNOS–/– origin were plated in 24-well dishes containing small circular ivory discs (5-mm diameter, 0.4-mm thick) and induced to form OCs via RANKL treatment as described above. Cells on the ivory discs were rinsed, fixed, stained for TRAP activity, and analyzed for TRAP+ cell formation and bone pit resorption as described previously (13Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L. Bekker S.

https://openalex.org/W1969650644,"Hsp70 chaperones assist protein folding processes by a nucleotide-driven cycle of substrate binding and release. Although structural information is available for the isolated nucleotide-binding (NBD) and substrate-binding domains (SBD) in the high affinity conformation, the low affinity conformations and the conformational changes associated with mutual allosteric regulation remained largely enigmatic. By using amide hydrogen exchange in combination with mass spectrometry, we analyzed the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homologue DnaK as full-length protein and its individual domains in the nucleotide-free and ATP-bound conformation. We found a surprising degree of flexibility in both domains. The comparison of the full-length protein with the isolated domains demonstrates a mutual stabilization of both domains. This protection from solvent was most pronounced and in addition was nucleotide-dependent in the lowerβ-sheet of the SBD and the loop that connects the last β-strand with helix αA. Interestingly, the linker region, which connects NBD and SBD and which is close to the protected loop in the SBD, is solvent-exposed in the absence of nucleotide and completely protected from hydrogen exchange in the presence of ATP. Peptide binding to DnaK·ATP reverts the ATP-induced conformational changes in the linker and selected parts of the NBD. Our data outline a pathway for allosteric interdomain control and suggest an important role of the linker and the base of helix αA.

Hsp70 chaperones assist a large variety of cellular protein folding processes ranging from folding of newly synthesized and stress-denatured polypeptides to the control of activity and stability of many native regulatory proteins (1Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2034) Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar). All of these functions are performed by Hsp70 chaperones through nucleotide-regulated transient interactions with their substrates. Hsp70 proteins consist of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) 5The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; SBD, substrate-binding domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HX, hydrogen exchange.5The abbreviations used are: NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; SBD, substrate-binding domain; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; HX, hydrogen exchange. with an actin-like fold connected via a short, highly conserved linker to a C-terminal, structurally unique substrate-binding domain (SBD). The SBD is further subdivided in a β-sheet subdomain containing the substrate-binding pocket and a helical subdomain considered to function as a lid over the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 1c) (3Flaherty K.M.

Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The substrate peptide, cocrystallized in the SBD, was bound by hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone and by hydrophobic interactions mainly between a single leucine of the substrate and the substrate-binding pocket. The crystal structure of the SBD in the high affinity conformation made clear that conformational changes are necessary to allow binding and release of substrates in this state. However, which parts of the SBD move to allow substrate binding remained elusive. ATP binding at the bottom of a deep cleft in the NBD induces conformational changes in the SBD leading to the transition from the high affinity to the low affinity state. Conversely, substrate binding to the SBD in synergism with a cochaperone of the J-domain protein family triggers ATP hydrolysis in the NBD. How the mutual allosteric regulation is achieved and what the conformational changes are with which this regulation is associated remained largely enigmatic because of the lack of suitable structural information. The crystal structure of the NBD of wild-type and mutant bovine Hsc70 and human Hsp70 proteins in complex with different nucleotides did not reveal major nucleotide-dependent conformational changes (5O'Brien M.C.

Chem. 2004; 279: 33958-33967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). How these perturbations relate to conformational changes and allosteric regulation, however, remained largely unclear. More recently, the crystal structure of a two-domain construct of bovine Hsc70 in the nucleotide-free state containing the NBD, the β-sheet subdomain, and part of the helical subdomain was published showing the contact sites between NBD and SBD (11Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, which conformational changes are linked to the ATPase cycle of Hsp70 proteins is still enigmatic. To analyze the conformational dynamics in Hsp70 proteins that allow substrate binding in the high affinity state and the nucleotide-dependent conformational change, we used native state amide hydrogen exchange (HX) technology in combination with mass spectrometry (MS), and we mapped the solvent accessibility of the backbone amides in Escherichia coli DnaK in dependence of bound nucleotide. Proteins—Wild-type DnaK, DnaK-T199A, DnaK-R151A, and DnaK-(2–385) were purified and made nucleotide-free as described (12Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The SBD of DnaK was purified as N-terminally histidine-tagged protein on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid fast flow Sepharose and subsequent ion exchange chromatography. Mass Spectrometry and Data Processing—Electrospray ionizationmass spectra were acquired on a quadrupole time of flight instrument (QSTAR pulsar, Applied Biosystems). Protein mass spectra were deconvoluted using the BioAnalyst software (Applied Biosystems). For full-length proteins, spectra were externally calibrated using apomyoglobin. Peptides of DnaK were identified either by their MS/MS spectra or by their exact masses. The deuterium content of the peptides was calculated by using the average mass difference between the isotopic envelopes of deuterated and undeuterated peptides. The average masses were determined by the MagTran software (14Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). HX Experiments—Nucleotide-free DnaK proteins were preincubated with an excess of ATP for 1 min or a peptide substrate (σ32-Met195–Asn207 (15McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)) for 1 h at 30 °C. HX experiments were performed similar to those described earlier (16Rist W. Jørgensen T.J.D. Roepstorff P. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51415-51421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Amide hydrogen exchange was initiated by a 20-fold dilution of 200 pmol of DnaK into D2O containing 25 mm HEPES, pD 7.6, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. After various time points (10 s-90 min), exchange reaction was quenched by decreasing the temperature to 0 °C and the pH with quench buffer (400 mm KH2PO4/H3PO4, pH 2.2). Quenched samples were directly injected into an HPLC setup and analyzed on an electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight-mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, Applied Biosystems) as described (17Rist W. Mayer M.P. Andersen J.S. Roepstorff P. Jorgensen T.J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 160-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For full-length protein analysis samples were trapped on a reversedphase column (1 × 20 mm; POROS 10 R 1 media, PerSeptive Biosystems), desalted for 1 min with buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O) at 400 μl·min–1, and eluted with 80% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) at 20 μl·min–1 for analysis. All HPLC components that come into contact with the samples are immersed in an ice-bath to minimize back exchange. For the analysis of peptide fragments samples were mixed 1:1 with quench buffer additionally containing 2 m guanidinium hydrochloride. The HPLC setup contained in these cases a combination of two columns (2 × 20 mm) packed with pepsin and Protease XIII (Aspergillus saitoi) immobilized on POROS-20AL beads (PerSeptive Biosystems). The resulting peptides were trapped on a reversed-phase column (POROS 50 R 2, PerSeptive Biosystems) and eluted from the trap column over a 0.75-mm inner diameter × 6-cm analytical reversed-phase column packed with Zorbax 300SB-C8 (3.5-μm particles) with a 10-min gradient of 15–55% buffer B into the electrospray source. The whole setup was immersed in an ice-bath to minimize back-exchange. A fully deuterated DnaK sample was analyzed under the same conditions to correct for back-exchange. Calculation of the Global Protection Factor—Experimental data were fit by nonlinear least squares to a sum of three exponential terms resulting in three exchange rates with the amplitudes corresponding to the number of exchanging amide hydrogens. The average chemical exchange rate was determined by simulating deuteron incorporation for different time intervals and back-exchange during the desalting step using the exchange rates for pD 7.6 and pH 2.4 calculated with the HXPep program (courtesy Z. Zhang) and fitting a single exponential equation to the values. Protection factors were calculated according to the equation for the EX2 exchange regime, p = 1/Kunf = kch/kobs (where Kunf indicates the unfolding equilibrium constant; kch indicates the average chemical exchange rate; kobs indicates the observed exchange rate (18Hvidt A. Nielsen S.O. Adv. Protein Chem. 1966; 21: 287-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar)). The lower limit of ΔG for the unfolding reaction was estimated according to ΔG =–RT ln(Kunf) =–RT ln(kobs/kch) setting for the non-exchanging amide hydrogens the lowest exchange rates (0.0001 s–1) detectable in our experiments. Conformational Flexibility of DnaK—We initially measured deuteron incorporation into wild-type DnaK in the absence of nucleotides or substrates to analyze the overall kinetics of the HX reaction. We therefore incubated DnaK for different time intervals in D2O, quenched the reaction by lowering the pH to 2.2 and the temperature to 0 °C, and subsequently analyzed the reaction on an HPLC-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry setup (16Rist W. Jørgensen T.J.D. Roepstorff P. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51415-51421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Rist W. Rodriguez F. Jorgensen T.J. Mayer M.P. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deuterons incorporated into full-length DnaK with apparent triple exponential kinetics leaving ∼40% of amide protons unexchanged after 1 h (data not shown; see Fig. 2). A protected core of 40–50% of all amide protons, which do not exchange under such conditions, is typical for a well folded native protein. To localize fast and slow exchanging regions in DnaK and to elucidate the flexible parts in the SBD, which allow substrate binding in the high affinity state, we performed the analysis of the HX reaction on our HPLC-MS setup, including two columns with immobilized pepsin and A. saitoi protease XIII, both of which are active under quench conditions at 0 °C, to generate on-the-fly peptide fragments of DnaK. The average peptide size was around 17 residues, and the overall sequence coverage with peptides that could be detected in every run was about 80% (Fig. 1a). Sample spectra are shown in Fig. 1, b and c; secondary structure representations of the NBD and SBD of DnaK are shown color-coded according to the relative deuteron incorporation after 10 and 60 s and 10 and 60 min. Overall there is good agreement between crystallographic data and the protection against HX. Well folded secondary structure elements incorporate deuterons to a lower degree than coil regions or less well defined helices and sheets. After 10 s of incubation in D2O, only the C-terminal region of the SBD exchanged its amide protons almost completely for deuterons. This is not surprising because the corresponding peptide includes most of the 30 C-terminal residues not contained in the crystal structure and therefore not visible in Fig. 1c, which were shown by NMR to be unstructured (20Bertelsen E.B. Zhou H. Lowry D.F. Flynn G.C. Dahlquist F.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The outer loops (L3,4 and L5,6) of the β-sheet subdomain of the SBD exchange amide protons faster than the inner loops (L1,2 and L4,5), which are packed against helices αA and αB. Interestingly, helix αB incorporates deuterons surprisingly fast with 20 of the 32 amide protons (62%) exchanged after 10 min and 26 (81%) after 60 min, leaving only 12 and 6 amide protons protected corresponding to three and one and a half-helix turns, respectively. These data indicate significant flexibility of this helix with transient opening of hydrogen bonds. The NBD subdomain IA appears to incorporate deuterons more rapidly than other parts of the NBD. However, because the resolution of our method is limited by the size of the peptides analyzed, close inspection of the data showed that most of the deuteron incorporation into subdomain IA can be accounted for by the unstructured coil regions. For example, the peptide, which includes the C-terminal helix of the NBD and the N-terminal part of the SBD, residues 371–391 6When referring to peptides, the actual residue numbers are given starting the count with the initiator methionine, which is removed in vivo and is therefore not present in our DnaK preparations. When referring to exchanged amide protons, the first residue of the analyzed peptide is omitted because it carries an amino group instead of an amide group, which rapidly back-exchanges any incorporated deuterons during the desalting step. (yellow in the 60-s time point in Fig. 1c), incorporates 11 deuterons within 60 s leaving 9 amide protons unexchanged. Even after 1 h, seven amide protons remain protected from exchange, corresponding to two helix turns, which is exactly the number of turns of the C-terminal helix of the NBD that is included in the peptide. It is therefore likely that this helix is very stable and that the part, which links the NBD to the SBD (indicated as dotted line in Fig. 1c), is almost completely solvent-accessible, consistent with the recent crystal structure of the two-domain construct of Hsc70 (11Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-dependent Solvent Accessibility Changes in Full-length DnaK—To assess the effects of nucleotides on the solvent accessibility of amide protons of DnaK, we first determined the overall kinetics of nucleotide-induced changes in HX. To analyze HX in DnaK in the presence of ATP over longer incubation times without interference with ATP hydrolysis, we used the DnaK-T199A mutant protein that is deficient in ATP hydrolysis but still proficient in ATP binding and undergoes ATP-induced conformational changes in the SBD like the wild-type protein (21Barthel T.K. Zhang J. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5482-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This protein was incubated in D2O in the nucleotide-free or ATP-bound state and analyzed after different time intervals by our HPLC-MS setup excluding the columns with immobilized proteases. As for wild-type DnaK deuteron incorporation into DnaK-T199A occurred with apparent triple exponential kinetics (τ1 = 2.5 s; τ2 = 110 s; τ3 = 1430 s) leading to the exchange of 354 (58%) of a total of 613 amide protons after 60 min (Fig. 2a). HX in the ATP-bound state occurred with similar kinetics (τ1 = 2.0 s; τ2 = 73 s; τ3 = 1670 s) but, surprisingly, leveled off at a significantly lower number of total incorporated deuterons (327) as compared with the nucleotide-free state (Fig. 2a). Because biochemical evidence, including substrate association and dissociation measurements and partial tryptic digestion, clearly demonstrated that ATP binding induces an opening of the SBD, we hypothesized that ATP-induced increase in solvent accessibility in the SBD may be counteracted by a decrease in solvent accessibility in other parts of the protein. We therefore repeated the experiment adding ATP at a later time point (20 min, >10 τ2) when most of the rapidly exchanging amides in nucleotide-free DnaK were already deuterated. Under these conditions addition of ATP led to the incorporation of seven additional deuterons as compared with the control without addition of ATP (Fig. 2b). These data show that ATP binding to the NBD leads to an increased solvent accessibility in some parts of the proteins that is counterbalanced by a decreased solvent accessibility in other parts. Localization of Nucleotide-induced Conformational Alterations—To localize the regions within DnaK with increased and decreased solvent accessibility, we repeated the analysis using the HPLC-MS setup with included protease columns (Fig. 3). 24 of 29 analyzed segments of DnaK incorporated less deuterons in the presence of ATP as compared with the nucleotide-free state consistent with our data on the full-length protein. The β-sheet subdomain of the SBD (fragments 413–437 to 486–511) exchanged amide protons more rapidly in the ATP-bound state as compared with the nucleotide-free state. In contrast, helix αB and the C-terminal part of the SBD exchanged amide protons more slowly (Fig. 3, a and b). Most segments of the NBD incorporated deuterons more slowly in the ATP-bound state as compared with the nucleotide-free state indicating a tightening of the NBD conformation (Fig. 3, a and b). Although the differences are small, they are highly reproducible and well reflected in the kinetics of deuteron incorporation as shown for selected segments in Fig. 3c. Most prominent is the difference between nucleotide-free and ATP-bound states in the linker region (Fig. 3, a and b, segments 372–391 and 389–392). In the nucleotide-free state, segment 389–392 exchanges all exchangeable amide hydrogens within 10 s indicating complete exposure to solvent consistent with the recent crystal structure (11Jiang J. Prasad K. Lafer E.M. Sousa R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 513-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3b). In contrast, in the ATP-bound state this segment does not exchange its amide hydrogens indicating complete protection. The overlapping segment 372–391 shows a similar behavior, high solvent accessibility in the nucleotide-free state, and almost complete protection in the ATP-bound state (Fig. 3, a and b). As comparison we analyzed the DnaK-R151A variant, which we recently identified as completely devoid in interdomain communication (22Vogel M. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 359-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3d). ATP-induced changes in deuteron incorporation into the NBD during a 1-min incubation in D2O were similar in this variant protein as compared with the wild-type protein (compare Fig. 3, a and d, segments 3–15 to 358–370). However, ATP-induced changes in deuteron incorporation into the SBD were strongly reduced (compare Fig. 3, a and d, segments 401–408, 413–437, 486–511, and 602–628). Most notable was the difference in segment 372–391. Upon ATP binding, six amide protons were protected from exchange in the wild-type protein, but only 1 was protected in the DnaK-R151A variant. Together these data demonstrate that ATP binding leads to pronounced changes in solvent accessibility in the NBD and in the substrate enclosing loops in the SBD. If communication between the two domains of DnaK is compromised by a mutational replacement in subdomain IA of the NBD, the changes in the SBD are no longer observed. HX analysis thus allows us to monitor the conformational changes occurring in DnaK during ATP-dependent interdomain communication. Mutual Influence of the Two Domains on Each Other—To analyze the mutual influence of the two domains on each other, we compared deuteron incorporation of the isolated domains with the incorporation into full-length protein in the nucleotide-free state and in the presence of ATP. Fig. 4a shows the difference plot of deuteron incorporation into wild-type DnaK (DDnaK-(2–638)) minus incorporation into the NBD (DDnaK-(2–385)). Most segments of the NBD incorporated a similar number of deuterons when the full-length protein was incubated for 1 min in D2O as when the isolated NBD was incubated. For some segments scattered throughout the NBD, deuterons were incorporated more rapidly in the isolated domain as compared with the full-length protein, indicating a slightly increased flexibility of the isolated domain. In the presence of ATP, four additional segments (segments 139–163, 164–177, 338–356, and 372–382) exhibit slower deuteron incorporation in the full-length protein as compared with the isolated NBD (Fig. 4, a and c). These four segments represent two regions of the NBD, the subdomain IA and parts of subdomains IIA and IIB that are located on the opposite face of the NBD as compared with the region in subdomain IA. The comparison of the deuteron incorporation into the isolated SBD (DnaK-(389–638)) with the incorporation into full-length DnaK also revealed surprising results (Fig. 4b). Overall, the isolated SBD exchanged in five of the eight segments investigated more amide protons than the full-length protein in the nucleotide-free state (Fig. 4b, white bars). This is most pronounced in segment 486–511, comprising half of β-strand 7, β-strand 8, and the first turn of helix αA, which exchanges on average 6.6 of the 26 amide protons in the full-length protein but 13.9 amide protons in the isolated SBD. Because helix αA of the SBD contains the major contact sites with the NBD in the recent crystal structure of the two-domain construct of Hsc70, we were eager to see whether these contacts would be measurable in solvent accessibility of this helix. By using an altered solvent gradient of the reversed-phase column, we were able to analyze a peptic peptide that contained the C-terminal part of helix αA and the N-terminal half of helix αB (Fig. 4d, 512–532). This peptide showed one deuteron difference when incubating the isolated SBD as compared with full-length DnaK in the nucleotide-free state suggesting only a slight stabilizing influence of the NBD on this region. When the isolated SBD is compared with full-length DnaK in the ATP-bound state, significant differences are still observed (Fig. 4b, black bars). The four C-terminal segments of the SBD still incorporate less deuterons in the full-length protein as compared with the isolated SBD, and only two segments (413–437 and 439–457) exchanged more in the full-length protein demonstrating the ATP-induced opening of the substrate-binding pocket. Similarly, the region 512–532 incorporates at least four deuterons more in the full-length protein in the presence of ATP than in the isolated domain, indicating that ATP-induced conformational changes also lead to an increased solvent accessibility of the amides of helices αA and αB (Fig. 4d). Taken together our comparison of HX into the isolated domains of DnaK with HX of full-length DnaK indicates that the two domains stabilize each other, an effect that is much more pronounced in the SBD than in the NBD. Substrate-induced Conformational Alterations—To analyze possible substrate-induced conformational changes in the SBD and the NBD, we compared the HX of full-length DnaK in the absence and presence of the peptide σ32-Met195–Asn207, which was identified earlier to be a high affinity substrate for DnaK (15McCarty J.S. Rüdiger S. Schönfeld H.-J. Schneider-Mergener J. Nakahigashi K. Yura T. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and in the absence and presence of ATP. In the absence of ATP, overall little changes in deuteron incorporation were observed except for the segments that form the substrate-enclosing loops L1,2 and L3,4. The HX kinetics of these two segments are shown in Fig. 5. The segment representing the inner loop L1,2 (residues 401–408) incorporates one to two deuterons very rapidly and a third over a period of about 1 h in the absence of the substrate peptide, whereas in the presence one of the three amide protons is completely protected from exchange (Fig. 5a). This result is consistent with the crystal structure that shows one amide proton completely free, one in a loose internal hydrogen bond (distance between amid N and carbonyl O 3.4 Å), and one forming a hydrogen bond to the backbone of the substrate peptide (4Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The HX kinetics of the segment representing the outer substrate enclosing loop L3,4 (residues 413–437) changed in a more surprising way upon substrate binding. In the absence of the substrate peptide, about six deuterons were incorporated within the shortest time interval measured (10 s). Consistent with the x-ray structure, 6 of the 24 amide protons directly coordinated to water (Protein Data Bank entry code 1DKX). Deuteron incorporation continued more slowly to arrive at 15 after 1 h, leaving 9 amide protons protected and consistent with the number of strong hydrogen bonds (O-N distance below 3 Å) within this segment in the x-ray structure. In the presence of a substrate deuteron incorporation was much slower. Only three amide protons exchanged within the first 10 s, and after 1 h deuteron incorporation approached 10 leaving 14 amide protons completely protected within this time frame. Because only two hydrogen bonds are formed with the substrate in the crystal structure, it must be concluded that parts of the segment represented by the analyzed peptide are stabilized upon substrate binding. To analyze the allosteric mechanism by which substrates induce ATP hydrolysis, we wanted to measure HX in the presence of peptide and ATP. To circumvent the problem of ATP hydrolysis during the incubation in D2O, we made use of the DnaK-T199A variant. None of the resulting mass spectra showed indications for a bimodal distribution of the isotopic peaks, indicating that all DnaK molecules were in the same conformation. Fig. 5c shows the comparison of deuteron incorporation after 1 min in D2O into selected segments of nucleotide-free DnaK-T199A in the absence or presence of the peptide σ32-Met195–Asn207 and in the absence or presence of ATP. Three different situations can be distinguished. First, the effects of ATP are dominant over the effects of peptide (segments 17–41 and 401–408) indicating that ATP was not hydrolyzed during the incubation time. Second, the effects of peptide are dominant over the effects of ATP (segments 139–163, 165–177, and 372–391) suggesting conformational changes that could be linked to allosteric control (discussed in det"

We have recently shown that nitric-oxide (NO) synthase 3 and cGMP-dependent protein kinase stimulate platelet secretion and aggregation. Here we show that PI3K-mediated Akt activation plays an important role in agonist-stimulated platelet NO synthesis and cGMP elevation. Agonist-induced elevation of NO and cGMP was inhibited by Akt inhibitors and reduced in Akt-1 knock-out platelets. Akt-1 knock-out or Akt inhibitor-treated platelets showed reduced platelet secretion and aggregation in response to low concentrations of agonists, which can be reversed by low concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP or sodium nitroprusside (an NO donor). Similarly, PI3K inhibitors diminished elevation of cGMP and inhibited platelet secretion and the second wave platelet aggregation, which was also partially reversed by 8-bromo-cGMP. These results indicate that the NO-cGMP pathway is an important downstream mechanism mediating PI3K and Akt signals leading to platelet secretion and aggregation. Conversely, the PI3K-Akt pathway is the major upstream mechanism responsible for activating the NO-cGMP pathway in platelets. Thus, this study delineates a novel platelet activation pathway involving sequential activation of PI3K, Akt, nitric-oxide synthase 3, sGC, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase.

Platelets play a critical role in thrombosis and hemostasis. At sites of vascular injury, platelets are activated by various soluble agonists such as thrombin and ADP and adhesive proteins such as collagen and von Willebrand factor. Although different agonists induce platelet activation via different signaling pathways, the signals induced by different agonists converge to common signaling events such as calcium mobilization and activation of the ligand binding function of the integrin αIIbβ3 that mediates platelet aggregation (1Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). An important feature of platelet activation is the ability to self-amplify the signals, which allows low concentrations of agonists to induce maximal platelet responses. This feature is particularly important in arteries where fast flow of blood may quickly dilute soluble agonists. One important mechanism of self-amplification is the secretion of platelet granule contents such as platelet agonists ADP and serotonin and adhesive proteins von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen (3Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). The secreted platelet agonists and adhesive proteins, via various pathways, form “positive feedback loops” that greatly amplify and stabilize platelet aggregation, thus sensitizing platelets to low doses of platelet agonists. The signaling mechanism leading to platelet granule secretion is not totally understood. We have recently shown that nitric oxide (NO) 3The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; SNP, sodium nitroprusside. synthesized by NO synthase 3 (NOS3, also called eNOS) stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase and induces cGMP elevation and activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), leading to secretion of platelet granules and the second wave of platelet aggregation (4Li Z.

Furthermore, our findings show that the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway plays a time- and concentration-dependent biphasic role in platelet activation, a stimulatory role at low concentrations of NO and cGMP synthesized following agonist stimulation, and an inhibitory role when platelets are exposed to high concentrations of NO and cGMP (4Li Z.

We have recently shown that PI3K plays an important role in signaling the aggregation-dependent secretion and thus the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PI3K, via phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1 activates Akt, which is a family of intracellular serine/threonine protein kinases (also called protein kinase B) (for reviews, please see Refs. 13Brazil D.P.

There are three isoforms of Akt: Akt-1, Akt-2, and Akt-3. Recent studies show that both Akt-1 and Akt-2 are important in low dose agonist-induced platelet activation and in platelet-dependent thrombus formation in vivo (16Woulfe D. Jiang H. Morgans A. Monks R. Birnbaum M. Brass L.F. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 17Chen J. De S. Damron D. Chen W.S. Hay N. Byzova T.V. Blood. 2004; 104: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the downstream signaling pathways that are responsible for PI3K- and Akt-mediated platelet activation have been unclear. Although Akt-1 has been shown to phosphorylate and activate NOS3 in endothelial cells (18Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar), the possibility that Akt may promote platelet secretion and aggregation via the NOS-sGC pathway has not been considered, partly because the dogma for the past 30 years has been that NO inhibits platelet activation. In this study, we present data showing that the PI3K-Akt pathway stimulates platelet NO synthesis and cGMP elevation during platelet activation and stimulates platelet secretion and secretion-dependent second wave platelet aggregation by activating the NO-cGMP pathway. Together with our recent findings, this study delineates a novel platelet activation signaling pathway in which platelet agonists activate PI3K and thus Akt, which stimulates NO synthesis and cGMP elevation, activates PKG, and induces secretion of granule contents such as ADP, thus amplifying and stabilizing platelet aggregation. Materials and Animals—Thromboxane A2 analog U46619, membrane-permeable cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP, PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and Ly294002, and Akt inhibitor SH-6 (19Kozikowski A.P. Sun H. Brognard J. Dennis P.A. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1144-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and Akt inhibitor 1 were purchased from Calbiochem. In some experiments, 8-bromo-cGMP from Axxora (San Diego, CA) was also used. Human α-thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was obtained from Sigma. Collagen was from Chronolog, Havertown, PA. The generation of Akt-1 knock-out mice has been previously described (20Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Akt-1 knock-out mice are on a mixed 129R1(50%)/C57BL (50%) background. Wild type control mice and Akt-1–/– mice used in this study were 8–15-week-old littermates generated from heterozygous breeding (20Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Platelet Aggregation and Secretion—Preparation of washed human platelets has been previously described (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For preparation of mouse platelets, blood from 5–6 mice of either genotype was pooled and platelets were isolated and washed as previously described (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Final concentration of resuspended platelets was 3 × 108/ml. Platelets were allowed to rest for at least 1 h at 22°C before use. Platelet aggregation and secretion of granule ATP were determined simultaneously in a Chronolog lumiaggregometer at 37 °C with stirring (1000 rpm) after addition of the luciferin-luciferase reagent and platelet agonists (U46619, collagen, and α-thrombin). To examine the effects of PI3K and Akt inhibitors on platelet function, platelets were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of inhibitors or corresponding vehicle controls, prior to addition of platelet agonists. To investigate the role of cGMP and NO donor SNP in Akt-mediated platelet aggregation and secretion, low concentrations of 8-Br-cGMP or SNP were added to platelets immediately following addition of the agonist. Experiments were repeated at least three times, and statistical significance was examined using Student's t test. Agonist-stimulated Platelet cGMP Elevation—Washed platelets (400 μl) were preincubated with Akt inhibitor (SH-6, dissolved in Me2SO) or Me2SO control for 1 min at 37 °C. After stimulation with agonists, platelets were stirred at 37 °C for 5 min and the reaction stopped by addition of 400 μl of ice-cold 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Samples were mixed and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant extracted with diethyl ether. The samples were lyophilized and cGMP concentration determined using a cGMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Amersham Biosciences. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by t test. Nitric Oxide Measurement—Washed platelets in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 12.1 mm NaHCO3, 2.5 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm d-glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) were stimulated with thrombin or collagen with stirring at 37 °C. NO release was measured in real time using a nafion-coated porphyrinic microsensor as previously described (21Brovkovych V. Stolarczyk E. Oman J. Tomboulian P. Malinski T. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NO concentrations were calibrated with standard nitric oxide solutions (21Brovkovych V. Stolarczyk E. Oman J. Tomboulian P. Malinski T. J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 1999; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some experiments, NO release was also measured using APOLO 4000 analyzer from World Precision Instruments (MPI), Sarasota, FL, with ISONOPF 100 NO sensor (WPI membrane and nafion-coated carbon fiber). Statistical analysis was performed using a t test. The Role of Akt in the Activation of Platelet Nitric Oxide Synthesis—We have recently shown that NOS 3 plays a stimulatory role in platelet activation by producing nitric oxide, thus stimulating cGMP synthesis and PKG activation (6Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the upstream mechanism of NOS activation during platelet activation, we examined the role of Akt-1 in agonist-stimulated NO synthesis in platelets. Platelet agonists such as thrombin and collagen induce elevation of platelet NO levels. Fig. 1 shows that NO production stimulated by thrombin was significantly reduced in Akt-1–/– platelets. Similarly, collagen-induced NO production was inhibited in Akt-1–/– platelets, suggesting that Akt-1 plays an important role in stimulating NO production during platelet activation in mice. To investigate whether Akt and PI3K play a role in human platelet NO production, human platelets were preincubated with Akt inhibitor SH6 (Fig. 1, E and F) or Akt inhibitor-1 (Fig. 1H) or PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (Fig. 1I) and wortmannin (not shown) and then stimulated with collagen. Platelet NO production was significantly inhibited by these inhibitors (Fig. 1C), indicating that Akt and PI3K are important in the activation of human platelet NO synthesis. Interestingly, although NO production was dramatically reduced, NO was still detectable in either Akt-1–/– platelets or Akt inhibitor-treated platelets stimulated with agonists. These results suggest the possible presence of an Akt-1-independent NO synthesis mechanism but do not exclude the roles of other Akt isoforms or possible incomplete inhibition of PI3K or Akt by inhibitors. These data indicate that Akt-1 is an important, but not the only, signal mediator in the activation of platelet NO synthesis. The Role of Akt and PI3K in Agonist-induced cGMP Production—A major role for NO in platelets is to stimulate soluble guanylyl cyclase that synthesizes cGMP. Therefore, we investigated whether Akt is important in agonist-induced cGMP elevation. Fig. 2 shows that the platelet agonists collagen, thrombin, and U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analog), induced significant elevation of cGMP in mouse and human platelets, which is consistent with results from previous studies (4Li Z.

Agonist-induced elevation was significantly reduced in Akt-1–/– cGMP mouse platelets (Fig. 2, A–C) and was also inhibited in human platelets treated with the Akt inhibitor SH6 (Fig. 2, D–F). These data indicate that Akt is indeed important in platelet cGMP elevation induced by platelet agonists. Because it is known that Akt-1 is activated by PI3K, we also examined the effect of a PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, on agonist-induced cGMP elevation. Fig. 3 shows that cGMP elevation was inhibited by wortmannin. Thus, the PI3K-Akt pathway stimulates platelet cGMP elevation by activating platelet NO synthesis.FIGURE 3Role of PI3K in thrombin-induced cGMP production. Washed human platelets were treated with PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm, dissolved in Me2SO) or with Me2SO (0.1%) and then stimulated with thrombin (0.02 units/ml) at 37 °C in a platelet aggregometer for 5 min. After stopping the reaction, platelet cGMP levels were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay. Bars represent mean ± S.D. (n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reduced Platelet Responses in Akt-1–/– Mouse Platelets and Rescue by cGMP—To determine whether the role of Akt in stimulating platelet NO and cGMP elevation is a mechanism responsible for its stimulatory role in platelet activation, we investigated the responses of Akt-1 knock-out platelets to platelet agonists, collagen, thrombin, and U46619. Compared with wild type platelets, Akt-1 knock-out mouse platelets showed reduced platelet aggregation in response to low concentrations of collagen and thrombin and a significantly retarded aggregation response to U46619 (Fig. 4). At high concentrations of agonists, the inhibitory effect of Akt knock out on platelet aggregation was not significant. These results indicate a role for Akt-1 in low dose agonist-induced platelet aggregation, consistent with previous studies indicating the stimulatory role of PI3K and Akt in platelet activation (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Woulfe D. Jiang H. Morgans A. Monks R.

Blood. 2004; 104: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The reduction in platelet aggregation in Akt-1–/– platelets is characteristic of reduced secretion-dependent secondary platelet activation and is similar to the reduced platelet secretion and aggregation in platelets with deficiencies in NOS3 or PKG (5Li Z. Zhang G. Marjanovic J.A. Ruan C. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42469-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, platelet secretion of ATP was significantly reduced in Akt-1-knock-out platelets (Fig. 4). These results suggest that, similar to platelet defects caused by PKG- or NOS3-knock-out, the Akt-1-knock-out platelets are mainly defective in platelet secretion and secretion-dependent secondary platelet aggregation. To exclude the possibility that the defect in ATP secretion is caused by the reduced total ATP in Akt-1–/– platelets, we have also determined total ATP contents in wild type and Akt-1–/– platelets and found that they are similar (data not shown). Thus, reduced secretion in Akt-1-deficient platelets is caused by defect in the secretion mechanism. Because Akt-1–/– platelets are defective in NO-mediated cGMP synthesis, we further investigated whether the reduced platelet responses in Akt-1 knock-out platelets could be rescued by a membrane-permeable cGMP analog. Indeed, low concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of Akt-1 knock out on platelet secretion and aggregation (Fig. 4A). As previously reported, the rescuing effect of 8-bromo-cGMP was shown only at low concentrations. High concentrations of cGMP inhibited platelet aggregation (Fig. 4B). The reversal by 8-bromo-cGMP is partial, possibly due to one or more of the following factors: the membrane-permeable cGMP analog may differ from endogenous cGMP in concentration, the site and timing of elevation, affinity for cGMP-binding proteins, or degradation by phosphodiesterases. The partial reversal may also indicate a possible cGMP-independent downstream pathway of Akt-1. Nevertheless, the significant reversal by the cGMP analog suggests that the NO and cGMP pathway is one of the important signaling mechanisms downstream of Akt-1 in promoting platelet secretion and aggregation. Inhibition of Platelet Secretion and Aggregation by an Akt Inhibitor and Rescue by cGMP—To confirm the role of Akt in cGMP-dependent platelet activation, we tested the effects of the Akt inhibitors SH6 and Akt inhibitor 1 on platelet activation. SH6 (Fig. 5) and Akt inhibitor 1 (not shown) inhibited platelet aggregation and secretion induced by low concentrations of platelet agonists thrombin, U46619, and collagen in human and mouse (not shown) platelets. As with the Akt-1–/– platelets, 8-bromo-cGMP significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of SH6 (Fig. 5) and Akt inhibitor 1 (not shown). Similar to the effect of the cGMP analog on Akt-1–/– platelets, the ability of cGMP to reverse the effect of SH6 or Akt inhibitor 1 only occurred when low concentrations of cGMP analogs were used. The concentrations of cGMP analog required for rescue varied with different agonists and different donors in different experiments. High concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP, as previously described, inhibited platelet aggregation (not shown, cf. Fig. 4B), which is consistent with our previous results that cGMP plays biphasic roles in platelet activation (4Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 6Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol.

Blood. 2003; 101: 4423-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the results obtained with either Akt-1 knock-out platelets or platelets treated with Akt inhibitors are consistent and show that Akt is an important component of the signaling mechanisms upstream of the cGMP signaling pathway. These results also suggest that human and mouse platelets share a similar dependence on an Akt-mediated pathway that is responsible for cGMP elevation and thus promotes cGMP-dependent platelet secretion and aggregation. Akt Inhibitor-induced Platelet Inhibition Is Reversed by an NO Donor—To further verify that NO-mediated cGMP elevation is downstream of Akt in promoting platelet activation, we determined whether the NO donor SNP reversed the effect of Akt inhibitor SH6. Similar to 8-bromo-cGMP, low concentrations of SNP significantly but partially reversed the inhibitory effects of SH6 on platelet secretion and aggregation in response to three different platelet agonists (Fig. 6A). These data indicate that Akt-mediated NO production is an important signal in promoting platelet activation. As with the cGMP analog, the reversal with SNP only occurred at low concentrations (Fig. 6B), and we found that the concentrations required for reversal can vary significantly in platelets from different donors used in different experiments (not shown). However, the biphasic effect of SNP (stimulatory at low concentrations and inhibitory at high concentrations) has always been consistent (Fig. 6B). Effects of cGMP Analogs in Rescuing the PI3K Inhibitor-induced Platelet Inhibition—Akt is activated by PI3K, which is also known to play an important role in mediating platelet secretion and the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of PI3K in cGMP signaling, human platelets were pretreated with wortmannin and then stimulated with thrombin. As reported previously (11Li Z. Zhang G. Le Breton G.C. Gao X. Malik A.B. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30725-30731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), wortmannin diminished platelet secretion and the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (Fig. 7). The wortmannin-induced reduction in platelet secretion and aggregation was partially rescued by low concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP (Fig. 7), suggesting that cGMP is downstream of PI3K and contributes to the mechanism by which PI3K promotes platelet aggregation. The data presented here define an important role for PI3K and Akt in stimulating platelet secretion and aggregation via the activation of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway. This study also links two apparently different platelet signaling pathways, the PI3K-Akt and the NO-cGMP pathways, and reveals the importance of this linkage in mediating platelet granule secretion and in amplifying and stabilizing platelet aggregation. The finding that the NO-cGMP pathway serves as one of the important downstream mediators of the PI3K-Akt pathway is a significant advance in our understanding of the roles of PI3K-Akt pathway in platelet activation. Several previous studies indicated that PI3K promotes platelet activation. PI3K inhibitors inhibited platelet aggregation (8Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C.

Consistent with the role of Akt in transmitting PI3K-mediated signals, two different isoforms of Akt, Akt1 and Akt2, have been found to be important in platelet activation (16Woulfe D. Jiang H.

Blood. 2004; 104: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The downstream mediators of the PI3K-Akt pathway have been unclear. Early studies suggested that PI3K promotes integrin activation in platelets (8Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol.

However, the defects in platelet aggregation caused by inhibitors of either PI3K or Akt as well as the defects in platelets from PI3K or Akt knock-out mice showed a characteristic of inhibition in the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (8Kovacsovics T.J.

Blood. 2004; 104: 1703-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed recently that PI3K in fact plays an important role in stimulating aggregation-dependent platelet secretion and thus amplifies the integrin-activation signal, inducing the second wave of platelet aggregation (11Li Z.

Several signaling molecules have been implicated as the downstream targets of Akt (13Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar, 14Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp.

These include glycogen synthase kinase-3β, p70S6 kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and NOS3 (18Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). Although the roles for most of these molecules in platelet activation are not clear, we have recently found that the NOS3-generated NO induces cGMP production by soluble guanylyl cyclase and activates the PKG-dependent platelet secretion pathway (6Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Stojanovic A. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37430-37438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that Akt induces NO synthesis and cGMP elevation during platelet activation and thus promotes platelet secretion and aggregation, as Akt-1–/– platelets or Akt inhibitor-treated platelets were defective in NO and cGMP elevation, platelet secretion, and the second-wave platelet aggregation induced by platelet agonists. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Akt knock-out or Akt inhibitors was corrected by supplementation with low concentrations of 8-bromo-cGMP or NO donor, SNP. Therefore, an important mechanism by which Akt stimulates platelet secretion is to activate NOS3 and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. The conclusion that the NO-cGMP pathway is an important downstream mediator of the PI3K-Akt signals in platelet activation does not exclude the possibility that PI3K and/or Akt may have other downstream effector pathways. In fact, the defect in platelet secretion and aggregation in Akt-1–/– platelets or in SH6-treated platelets were only partially corrected by supplementation with cGMP analogs and NO donors. It is possible that NO donor SNP or the membrane-permeable cGMP analog may not completely substitute for the endogenously produced NO and cGMP due to the differences in structure, location, and timing of elevation, etc. However, the observation of partial restoration of platelet aggregation by NO donors and cGMP analogs in Akt-1–/– platelets may also suggest the possibility that other downstream effectors of Akt are important in Akt-mediated platelet activation. Although the role of PI3K and Akt in stimulating platelet activation is generally accepted, the role of NO and cGMP in platelet activation has been controversial (26Feil R. Feil S. Hofmann F. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 71-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although early studies suggested a stimulatory role for cGMP (22Chiang T.M. Beachey E.H. Kang A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6916-6922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Haslam R.J. Davidson M.M.

Med. 1976; 88: 215-221PubMed Google Scholar), it has been dogma for the past 30 years that NO and cGMP play inhibitory roles in platelet activation, as it was demonstrated that high concentrations of NO donors and cGMP analogs inhibited platelet function (28Saxon A. Kattlove H.E. Blood. 1976; 47: 957-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mellion B.T. Ignarro L.J. Ohlstein E.H. Pontecorvo E.G. Hyman A.L. Kadowitz P.J.

Med. 1999; 189: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, we have recently found that low concentrations of endogenously synthesized NO and cGMP in fact promote platelet secretion and aggregation (4Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 5Li Z. Zhang G. Marjanovic J.A. Ruan C. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42469-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These apparently controversial results are well explained by the difference in the concentrations and timing of the NO donors and cGMP analogs used in different studies (4Li Z. Xi X. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X. Cell. 2003; 112: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 7Li Z. Ajdic J. Eigenthaler M. Du X. Blood. 2003; 101: 4423-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that NO and cGMP play a biphasic role in platelet activation: a stimulatory role at low concentrations of cGMP induced during platelet activation and an inhibitory role at high concentrations. In addition, a major mechanism by which the NO-cGMP pathway stimulates platelet activation is to induce platelet secretion and the secretion-dependent second wave of platelet aggregation (5Li Z. Zhang G. Marjanovic J.A. Ruan C. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42469-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vitro effect of NO and cGMP on platelet activation is apparent only when low dose platelet agonists are used, with which aggregation-dependent secretion is required for full-scale platelet aggregation. In contrast, some previous studies used platelets that failed to respond to low dose platelet agonists and showed aggregation traces characteristic of a lack of platelet secretion (32Marshall S.J. Senis Y.A. Auger J.M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Salmon G. Peterson J.T. Burslem F. Watson S.P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Du X. Marjanovic J.A. Li Z. Blood. 2004; 103: 4371-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Because high dose agonist-induced platelet aggregation as reported in such studies did not require aggregation-dependent platelet secretion, it is reasonable that the role of the NO-cGMP pathway in secretion would not be manifested under these conditions. Because the stimulatory roles of P13K and Akt in platelet activation are known, the present finding that the PI3K-Akt pathway is the major upstream activator of the NOS and requires NO and cGMP for its stimulatory effect provides further support for the stimulatory role of agonist-induced endogenous NO and cGMP production in platelet activation. More importantly, our findings delineate a novel signaling pathway that stimulates platelet granule secretion and aggregation. In this new pathway, platelet agonists sequentially activate PI3K, Akt, and NOS3, which synthesizes NO. NO stimulates guanylyl cyclase, which elevates intracellular cGMP levels. Elevation of cGMP activates PKG, which activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (34Li Z. Xi X. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 35Li Z. Zhang G. Feil R. Han J. Du X.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42469-42475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Secreted granule contents such as ADP amplify platelet activation signals, leading to the further activation of platelet integrins and the second wave of platelet aggregation (Fig. 7B). Platelet secretion is also likely to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2083629460,"Although the initial growth and development of most multicellular animals depends on the provision of yolk, there are many varied contrivances by which animals provide additional or alternative investment in their offspring. Providing offspring with additional nutrition should be favoured by natural selection when the consequent increased fitness of the young offsets any corresponding reduction in fecundity. Alternative forms of nutrition may allow parents to delay and potentially redirect their investment. Here we report a remarkable form of parental care and mechanism of parent-offspring nutrient transfer in a caecilian amphibian. Boulengerula taitanus is a direct-developing, oviparous caecilian, the skin of which is transformed in brooding females to provide a rich supply of nutrients for the developing offspring. Young animals are equipped with a specialized dentition, which they use to peel and eat the outer layer of their mother's modified skin. This new form of parental care provides a plausible intermediate stage in the evolution of viviparity in caecilians. At independence, offspring of viviparous and of oviparous dermatotrophic caecilians are relatively large despite being provided with relatively little yolk. The specialized dentition of skin-feeding (dermatophagous) caecilians may constitute a preadaptation to the fetal feeding on the oviduct lining of viviparous caecilians."

Recent studies demonstrate that chondrocyte maturation was completely absent in Runx2 and Runx3 double knock-out mice (19Yoshida. C. A. Yamamoto Fujita H. Furuichi T. Ito T. Inoue K. Yamana K.

The mechanism through which Runx2 induces osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation involves both the withdrawal from cell cycle and the activation of osteoblast and chondrocyte-specific genes. Runx2 is expressed in proliferating osteoblasts and chondrocytes and causes efficient withdrawal from the cell cycle prior to the differentiation process. Recent data demonstrate a direct link between Runx2 and cell cycle regulation (20Galindo M. Pratap J. Young D.W. Hovhannisyan H. Im H.-J. Choi J.Y. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. J.

Cell cycle regulation is controlled by a combination of cyclins, Cdks, and Cdk inhibitors, which together with the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (Rb) are involved in the tight control of cell cycle machinery. Cdks, in association with their regulatory partners, the cyclins, are key regulators of cell cycle progression. Cyclin D (D1, D2, D3)-Cdk4/Cdk6 and cyclin A/E-Cdk2 are involved in regulation of the G1/S transition (21Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 79: 547-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 22Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). Cyclin D-Cdk4/Cdk6 promotes the phosphorylation of Rb. The hypophosphorylated Rb proteins are known to inhibit the function of the E2F proteins, which promote transcription of factors essential for DNA synthesis (23Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Rb by the cyclin D-Cdk complexes relieves inhibition of Rb on the E2F function, promoting the entry of cells into S phase. Recent observations implicate that in addition to their function as cell cycle regulators, the cyclin D proteins also serve as regulators for transcription factors and signaling proteins (24Hirai H.

In this report, we show that cyclin D1-Cdk4 induces Runx2 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome degradation and thereby inhibits differentiation while stimulating proliferation. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS and C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 condition. DNA plasmids were transiently transfected into COS or C3H10T1/2 cells in 6-cm culture dishes using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen). Empty vector was used to keep the total amount of DNA transfected constant. FLAG-EGFP plasmid was co-transfected as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Western blot and immunoprecipitation (IP) assays were performed 24 h after transfection. Western Blot Analysis and IP Assays—Western blot and IP assays were performed as described previously (27Shen R. Chen M. Wang Y.J. Kaneki H. Xing L. O'Keefe R.J. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3569-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis—FLAG-tagged mouse Runx2 cDNA (MASN isoform, NCBI accession number: NM_009820) was amplified by PCR, sequenced, and cloned into pcDNA3 and pCMV-Tag2 expression vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutant Runx2 constructs (SA-Runx2 and SE-Runx2) were generated using Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and cloned into pcDNA3 and pCMV-Tag2 vector (Stratagene). In Vivo Protein Decay Assay—Cells were seeded in 15-cm culture dishes, and equal amounts of FLAG-Runx2, FLAG-SA-Runx2, and FLAG-SE-Runx2 were transfected, respectively. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and split into five 10-cm dishes. 12 h after recovery, each sample was cultured in regular medium with 80 μg/ml cycloheximide (Calbiochem), and samples from time 0, 20, 60, 120, and 300 min were harvested. Western blot was performed to detect the decay of wild-type (WT) and mutant Runx2 proteins. In Vitro Runx2 Phosphorylation by Reconstituted Cyclin D1-Cdk4—GST-Runx2 and GST-SA-Runx2 plasmids were generated by PCR-based cloning. GST-Rb-(379–928) and GST-Smad4 were used as controls. GST-tagged WT and mutant cDNAs were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The induction of protein expression was detected by Coomassie Blue staining. To isolate soluble proteins, 100 ml of bacterial cultures are spun down, and pellets are resuspended in 10 ml of bacterial lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 15 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mg/ml lysozyme) at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysate was sonicated until no longer viscous and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant is subjected to 100 μl of GST beads pulldown. After columns have been washed three times with sample buffer, the recombinant proteins were washed off with 5 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Active cyclinD1-Cdk4 was obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions (Charlottesville, VA). The cyclinD1-Cdk4 enzyme mix was used to phosphorylate recombinant substrates for 40 min in 20-μl reactions containing 35 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 μm ATP at 30 °C. After phosphorylation, the recombinant Runx2 or control proteins were directly denatured by sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE gel analysis. After protein samples have been analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel, the whole gel was subjected to Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein staining (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase Assay—The 6xOSE2-Luc reporter construct (4Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with Runx2 expression plasmid and different amounts of cyclin D1 expression plasmid into C3H10T1/2 cells. Cell lysates were extracted 24 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a Promega Dual Luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Alkaline Phosphatase Assay and Real-time Reverse transcription-PCR Analysis—The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and p27 mRNA expression was examined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay (28Kaneki H. Guo R. Chen D. Yao Z. Schwarz E.M. Zhang Y.E. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4326-4333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and ALP activity measurements were performed as described previously (29Zhao M. Qiao M. Harris S.E. Oyajobi B.O. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12854-12859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 Induces Runx2 Degradation—To determine whether cell cycle proteins regulate Runx2 function, we first examined the effect of cyclin proteins on Runx2 degradation. FLAG-Runx2 expression plasmid was co-transfected with expression plasmids of cyclin A and cyclin D1 into COS cells, and changes in Runx2 protein levels were detected by Western blot. Transfection of cyclin D1 significantly reduced Runx2 protein level in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, cyclin A did not alter Runx2 protein levels (Fig. 1a). These results suggest that cyclin D1 induces Runx2 degradation. Cyclin D1 normally forms a complex with Cdk4, which induces phosphorylation of substrate proteins. To determine whether Cdk4 interacts with Runx2, we performed an IP assay. FLAG-Runx2 and cyclin D1 expression plasmids were transfected into COS cells, and IP was performed using an anti-Cdk4 antibody. The interaction of Runx2 with Cdk4 was detected by Western blot using an anti-FLAG antibody. The interaction of cyclin D1 with Cdk4 was also detected by Western blot as a positive control (Fig. 1b). These results demonstrate that the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex directly interacts with Runx2 and induces Runx2 degradation. Cyclin D1 Targets the C-terminal Domain of Runx2—A putative SP motif was identified in the C terminus of the murine Runx2 protein at amino acids 472–475 (MASN isoform, amino acid 1–528). To determine whether the C-terminal region of Runx2 is important for the protein stability, a truncated Runx2 construct with a C-terminal 79-aminoacid deletion was generated (mRunx2, 1–449). We found that the mRunx2-(1–449) was more stable than WT-Runx2 in COS cells (Fig. 1c). When cyclin D1 was co-transfected with WT or mutant Runx2, cyclin D1 induced the degradation of WT but not mutant Runx2 containing a C-terminal 79-amino-acid deletion (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of Runx2 is important for Runx2 protein stability. Serine-472 Is Required for Runx2 Degradation—To determine the importance of the serine-472 residue for Runx2 stability, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace serine-472 with alanine (SA-Runx2) or glutamic acid (SE-Runx2). Prior work has established that replacement of serine with alanine abolishes phosphorylation, whereas replacement with glutamic acid mimics constitutive phosphorylation of cyclin-Cdk substrate proteins (26Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 30Wee H.J. Huang G. Shigesada K. Ito Y. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As expected, the Western blot analysis revealed that the SA-Runx2 was more stable than WT-Runx2 and that the SE-Runx2 was very unstable in COS cells and mesenchymal pluripotent C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 2a). The results were further confirmed by the protein decay assay. Runx2 protein levels were significantly reduced at 300 min after protein synthesis was stopped by the treatment of cells with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. The SA-Runx2 was stable during the entire 300-min period after cells were treated with cycloheximide. In contrast, the SE-Runx2 was significantly degraded at the 60–120-min period after cells were treated with cycloheximide (Fig. 2b). To determine whether the serine-472 residue of Runx2 plays a critical role in cyclin D1-induced Runx2 degradation, cyclin D1 expression plasmid was co-transfected with either WT- or SA-Runx2 plasmid into COS cells. Cyclin D1 induced WT-Runx2 degradation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). In contrast, cyclin D1 had no effect on SA-Runx2 degradation (Fig. 2d). These results indicate that serine-472 is critical for Runx2 stability. Cyclin D1 Induces Runx2 Phosphorylation—We then examined the role of cyclin D1 in Runx2 phosphorylation. Cyclin D1 plasmid was co-transfected with FLAG-Runx2 or FLAG-SA-Runx2 plasmids into COS cells, and IP was performed with the anti-FLAG antibody followed by the Western blot using the anti-phosphoserine antibody. Although WT-Runx2 was phosphorylated, minimal phosphorylation of SA-Runx2 was observed (Fig. 3a). To confirm this finding, GST-Runx2 and GST-SA-Runx2 fusion proteins were generated, and the in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed. The GST-Rb-(379–928) was used as a positive control, and GST-Smad4 was used as a negative control (Matsuura et al. (26Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar)). The in vitro phosphorylation was induced by the incubation of recombinant proteins with purified cyclin D1-Cdk4 enzymes. Although strong phosphorylation was detected for WT-Runx2, a weak phosphorylation was detected for SA-Runx2. As reported previously, Rb protein was phosphorylated by cyclin D1-Cdk4 in this assay, but Smad4 protein was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3b). The results demonstrate serine-472 as a target for cyclin D1-Cdk4-induced Runx2 phosphorylation. Cyclin D1-induced Runx2 Degradation Is Ubiquitin-Proteasome-dependent—To determine the role of cyclin D1 in Runx2 ubiquitination, FLAG-Runx2 plasmid was co-transfected with cyclin D1 in the presence or absence of proteasome inhibitor 1 (PS1). The IP was performed using the anti-FLAG antibody, and Runx2 ubiquitination was detected by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. Cyclin D1 significantly induced Runx2 ubiquitination. In the presence of PS1, cyclin D1-induced Runx2 ubiquitination was increased (Fig. 3c). To determine the role of serine-472 in Runx2 ubiquitination, the expression plasmids of WT-, SA-, and SE-Runx2 were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin into COS cells in the presence of PS1. The ubiquitinated protein ladder of WT-Runx2 was detected. When the SE-Runx2 was immunoprecipitated, a stronger Runx2 ubiquitination band was observed. In contrast, no ubiquitination was detected when SA-Runx2 was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3d). To determine whether cyclin D1-induced Runx2 degradation is proteasome-dependent, cells were treated with PS1 after they were co-transfected with Runx2 and different amounts of cyclin D1 plasmid. Cyclin D1 induced a dose-dependent degradation of Runx2, which was completely reversed by the addition of PS1 (Fig. 3e). To further determine whether the serine-472 site is critical for Runx2 degradation, COS cells were transfected with WT- and SA-Runx2 and then treated with PS1. The results showed that treatment with PS1 increased the protein level of WT-Runx2 but not SA-Runx2 (Fig. 3f). These results further demonstrate that cyclin D1 induces Runx2 ubiquitination and that proteasome-dependent degradation and serine-472 is critical for cyclin D1-induced Runx2 degradation. The Biological Significance of Cyclin D1-induced Runx2 Degradation—To determine whether the cyclin D1-induced Runx2 degradation alters Runx2 transcriptional activity, Runx2 expression plasmid was co-transfected with different amounts of cyclin D1 plasmid and the Runx2 reporter, 6xOSE2-Luc, into C3H10T1/2 cells. Although Runx2 significantly increased reporter activity (6-fold), co-transfection with cyclin D1 dose-dependently inhibited Runx2-induced reporter activity (Fig. 4a). To determine the effect of serine-472 on Runx2 transcriptional activity, WT-, SA-, and SE-Runx2 expression plasmids were co-transfected with 6xOSE2-Luc reporter into C3H10T1/2 cells. The SA-Runx2 had higher activity, and SE-Runx2 had lower activity on activation of the 6xOSE2-Luc reporter when compared with WT-Runx2 (Fig. 4b). The results demonstrate that cyclin D1 induces Runx2 degradation, leading to changes in Runx2 transcriptional activity. Runx2 plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation and regulates the expression of osteoblast marker genes such as ALP. To further determine the biological significance of serine-472 of Runx2, WT-, SA-, and SE-Runx2 plasmids were transfected into C3H10T1/2 cells, and changes in ALP mRNA expression and ALP activity were examined. We found that transfection of WT-Runx2 significantly stimulated ALP mRNA expression (2.83-fold increase) and activity (3.56-fold increase) in C3H10T1/2 cells. SA-Runx2 had much higher stimulatory effects on ALP mRNA expression (8.1-fold increase) and activity (11.63-fold increase). In contrast, the effects of SE-Runx2 on ALP mRNA expression and activity were 65 and 72% lower, respectively, when compared with the WT-Runx2 transfection group (Fig. 4c). In addition, Runx2 has also been shown to inhibit the activity of S-phase cyclin complex through inducing the expression of p27KIP1, leading to the dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) and a G1 cell cycle arrest (31Thomas D.M. Johnson S.A. Sims N.A. Trivett M.K. Slavin J.L. Rubin B.P. Waring P. McArthur G.A. Walkley C.R. Holloway A.J. Diyagama D. Grim J.E. Clurman B.E. Bowtell D.D. Lee J.S. Gutierrez G.M. Piscopo D.M. Carty S.A. Hinds P.W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 925-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we found that transfection of WT-Runx2 stimulated p27 mRNA expression (2.4-fold increase) in C3H10T1/2 cells. Transfection of SA-Runx2 caused a 6.6-fold increase in p27 expression. In contrast, the effect of SE-Runx2 on p27 expression is 68% lower than WT-Runx2 (Fig. 4d). These results demonstrate that Ser-472 of Runx2 plays an important role in Runx2-induced osteoblast differentiation, p27 expression, and cell cycle regulation. In the present studies, we demonstrate for the first time that cell cycle proteins regulate the key transcription factor Runx2 by inducing its phosphorylation and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The serine-472 residue plays a critical role in cyclin D1-induced Runx2 phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, cyclin D1-Cdk4 controls Runx2 transcriptional activity and physiological function in osteogenic progenitor C3H10T1/2 cells. Although regulation by cell cycle proteins has not been characterized for Runx2 in bone and cartilage, regulation of differentiation-associated transcription factors by cell cycle proteins has been well established in other cell types, such as myoblasts. MyoD is a key transcription factor controlling the myoblast differentiation. Its phosphorylation and degradation is controlled and regulated by cyclin B-Cdk1/Cdk2. Cyclin B induces phosphorylation of serine-200 of MyoD protein and triggers MyoD ubiquitination and rapid degradation (32Song A. Wang Q. Goebl M.G. Harrington M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 33Kitzmann M. Vandromme M. Schaeffer V. Carnac G. Labbe J.C. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3167-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). An inverse relationship between proliferation and differentiation has been reported in many developmental processes, such as myogenesis and neural development. Previous findings suggest that this inverse relationship is regulated at different levels. For example, cyclin-Cdk complexes phosphorylate MyoD and induce its degradation (10Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T.

In addition, hypophosphorylated Rb acts as a co-repressor for E2F-induced gene expression of cell cycle proteins, and it also serves as a co-activator for Runx2-induced osteoblast differentiation (34Thomas D.M.

In the present studies, we report that cyclin D1-Cdk4 directly phosphorylate Runx2 and induce Runx2 ubiquitination and proteasome degradation, suggesting that coordinated relationship between proliferation and differentiation also exists during skeletal development (Fig. 4e). The existence of these mutual inhibitions provides the handles for regulation of cellular functions by different signaling pathways. Previously, we have shown that the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) Smurf1 induces Runx2 degradation (35Zhao M. Qiao M. Oyajobi B. Mundy G.R. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27939-27944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and that Smad6 enhances Smurf1-induced Runx2 degradation (27Shen R. Chen M. Wang Y.J. Kaneki H. Xing L. O'Keefe R.J. Chen D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3569-3576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have analyzed the effect of Smurf1 on the degradation of WT- and SA-Runx2 and found that Smurf1 induced WT as well as SA mutant Runx2 in a similar efficiency, suggesting that Smurf1 is not involved in the cyclin D1-induced, phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Runx2. Further investigation is required to identify the novel E3 ligase that is involved in the cyclin D1-Cdk4-induced Runx2 ubiquitination and degradation. Proper development of bone tissues requires precise spatial and temporal control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Although Runx2 is expressed during early skeletal development (embryonic days 11.5–14.5), the formation of hypertrophic chondrocytes and mature osteoblasts does not occur in most bones until embryonic days 14.5–15.5 (15Kim I.S. Otto F. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Runx2 function must be suppressed during early bone development to allow chondrocyte and osteoblast pools to proliferate and expand. One possible mechanism for the suppression of Runx2 function during early bone development is through cyclin D1-Cdk4-induced degradation. More detailed in vivo studies need to be conducted to further investigate this hypothesis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex phosphorylates Runx2 and induces Runx2 degradation in an ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent manner. This study reveals a tightly regulated mechanism between bone cell growth and differentiation."

Recent evidence suggests that STAT3 activation may also occur downstream of receptor-tyrosine kinase activation. In the current study we have identified STAT3 as a novel signal transducer for TrkA, the receptor-tyrosine kinase that mediates the functions of nerve growth factor (NGF). Activation of TrkA by NGF triggered STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser-727, and enhanced the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of STAT3. More importantly, neurotrophin-induced increase in STAT3 activation was observed to underlie several downstream functions of neurotrophin signaling. First of all, knockdown of STAT3 expression using the RNA interference approach attenuated NGF-induced transcription of immediate early genes in PC12 cells. Furthermore, reduced STAT3 expression in PC12 cells suppressed NGF-induced cyclin D1 expression, thereby inhibiting growth arrest normally triggered by NGF treatment. Finally, inhibition of STAT3 expression decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor-promoted neurite outgrowth in primary hippocampal neurons.

Neurotrophins are a family of trophic factors critical for the survival and development of neurons within the peripheral and central nervous systems. Members of the family include the prototypic member nerve growth factor (NGF), 3The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; Erk, extracellular-regulated kinase; Ros, roscovitine; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DIV, days in vitro; SIE, Sis-inducible element.3The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Cdk5, cyclin-dependent kinase 5; Erk, extracellular-regulated kinase; Ros, roscovitine; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DIV, days in vitro; SIE, Sis-inducible element. brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and NT-4/5 in the mammals, and NT-6/7 in the fish species (1Ip N.Y.

The actions of neurotrophins are mediated by Trks, a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Binding of neurotrophins to their cognate receptors TrkA, TrkB, or TrKC induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors, resulting in their transactivation. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptors then serve as docking sites for various adaptor molecules, thereby activating multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways including Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and phospholipase Cγ. Although the intricate signaling cascade activated may directly take part in mediating the downstream functions of neurotrophins, initiation of gene transcription also plays an important role (3Huang E.J. Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 609-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 4Ng Y.P. Lo K.Y. Cheung Z.H. Ip N.Y. Handbook of Neurochemistry and Molecular Neurobiology.3rd Ed.

Among the transcription factors triggered by Trk signaling, for example, phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein) is involved in neurotrophin-mediated neuronal differentiation and survival (6Finkbeiner S.

Activation of Egr-1 has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in the initiation of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (9Cao X.M. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Induction of AP-1 activity, on the other hand, is implicated in the pro-survival property of NGF in serum-deprived PC12 cells (10Tong L. Werrbach-Perez K. Perez-Polo J.R. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest and importance to further elucidate the roles of various transcription factors in neurotrophin/Trk signaling. Recently, activation of STAT3, a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family, has been observed after activation of several RTKs such as ErbB and Eph receptors (11Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I.

STAT3 was originally identified as a crucial downstream component in cytokine signaling (13Lai K.O. Chen Y. Po H.M. Lok K.C. Gong K. Ip N.Y. J. Biol.

The canonical STAT3 activation pathway involves recruitment of STAT3 to the cytokine receptors, such as gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, upon cytokine stimulation. The phosphorylation of STAT3 by receptor-associated Janus kinases at tyrosine 705 (Tyr-705) subsequently leads to activation and homo- or heterodimerization of the STAT1/3 transcription factors. These homo- or heterodimers of STAT1/3 then translocate to the nucleus, activating multiple target gene transcription via interaction with specific DNA-response elements (14Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). In addition to Tyr-705 phosphorylation, phosphorylation of STAT3 at serine 727 (Ser-727) has also been demonstrated to play a regulatory role in STAT3 activation. The precise function of Ser-727 phosphorylation nonetheless remains obscure. It is generally believed that Ser-727 phosphorylation is required for STAT3 to achieve its maximal transcriptional activity (16Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 17Schuringa J.J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, Ser-727-phosphorylated STAT3 has also been suggested to mediate transcription activation without a detectable Tyr-705 phosphorylation (18Ceresa B.P. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12121-12124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol.

On the other hand, studies demonstrating an inhibitory effect of Ser-727 phosphorylation on Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3 have been reported (19Lim C.P. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Chung J. Uchida E. Grammer T.C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

The apparently contradictory findings are likely due to the use of different cellular systems and treatment paradigms, as different kinases are implicated to mediate STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation in different experimental systems (12Fu A.K.

Several studies have investigated the functional roles of STAT3 in neural stem cell differentiation, survival, and inflammatory response of neurons after injury and regulation of leptin signaling in the hypothalamus (30Taga T. Fukuda S. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2005; 28: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 31Qiu J. Cafferty W.B. McMahon S.B. Thompson S.W. J.

Life Sci. 2003; 62: 642-652Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, information on the functions of STAT3 in developing neurons remains limited. In this study we present evidence that STAT3 is activated upon NGF stimulation through TrkA receptor in PC12 cells. NGF treatment resulted in the induction of DNA binding and transcriptional activities of STAT3, suggesting that activation of STAT3 might partially contribute to the transcription of NGF-induced genes. Moreover, inhibition of STAT3 expression by RNA interference attenuated the antiproliferative effect of NGF in PC12 cells via the suppression of cyclin D1 expression. Finally, reduction of STAT3 expression also markedly attenuated the promoting effect of BDNF on neurite extension in cultured hippocampal neurons. These findings reveal an essential role of STAT3 in the downstream functions of neurotrophin signaling and provide novel insights on the roles of STAT3 in the nervous system. Antibodies, DNA Constructs, and siRNAs—The antibodies against phosphorylated forms of STAT3 and threonine/tyrosine-phosphorylated Erk1/2 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Polyclonal antibodies that recognize Cdk5, cyclin D1, Egr-1, and p300 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody specific for actin was from Sigma. Antibody that recognized STAT3 was from Transduction Laboratories. The expression vectors for STAT3, STAT3M (Ser-727 to Ala-727 (12Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K. Chien W.W. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc.

The luciferase construct that was linked to the STAT3-responsive enhancer (pSTAT3-Luc) was a kind gift from Prof. Yung-hou Wong (The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology). Stealth™ RNA interference molecules for STAT3 and Cdk5 were designed with the on-line software from Invitrogen. The sequences used were: STAT3 siRNA, GGAAAUUUAACAUUCUGGGCACGAA; control siRNA (STAT3), GGAUUUCAAUUAGUCCGGCAAAGAA; Cdk5 siRNA, CCUCCGGGAGAUCUGUCUACUCAAA; control siRNA (Cdk5), CCUAGGGCUAGCUGUUCAUCCCAAA. Cell Cultures—PC12 cells were cultured and maintained as described (33Ng Y.P. He W. Ip N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38731-38739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 6% heat-inactivated horse serum, 6% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Cells were routinely grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 7.5% CO2, and medium was changed every 3 days. For NGF-induced differentiation, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 1% serum and 50 ng/ml NGF (Alomone Labs). For analysis of protein phosphorylation, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 4 h and then stimulated with NGF or BDNF for the times indicated. For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with K252a (100 nm), U0126 (10 μm), H7 (100 μm), roscovitine (Ros, 25 μm), or wortmannin (100 nm) for 1 h before NGF treatment. Transient transfection of STAT3 or STAT3 mutant constructs was carried out using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen) reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection of Stealth™ RNA interference molecules was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) reagent as suggested by the manufacturer. Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 (E18) rat embryos. Cortices were dissected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, dissociated in the same medium, and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated culture plates. Cells were cultured in neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement, 0.5 mm glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. In the study of STAT3 phosphorylation, cultures at DIV7 (7 days in vitro) were washed with neurobasal medium twice and kept in the same medium for 1 h. BDNF at 50 ng/ml was added for the time indicated. Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from E18 embryos and cultured using similar procedures as described above for cortical neurons. Transfection of Stealth™ RNA interference and green fluorescent protein-expressing vector was performed on culture at DIV2 with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent as described by the manufacturer. BDNF at 50 ng/ml was added for 2 days after the transfection. Immunohistochemical Analysis—After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, PC12 cells were blocked with 4% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with STAT3 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:1000), anti-phosphotyrosine STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000), or anti-phosphoserine STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:1000) at 4 °C overnight and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences, 1:1000) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were mounted with Mowiol and analyzed under Olympus confocal microscope. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—PC12 cells were harvested and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer with 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The proteins separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron). After blocking with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody (1:1000) at 4 °C overnight and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h and detected using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blot System (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates (1 mg) were incubated with 1 μg of indicated antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by the addition of 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with the lysis buffer, immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis as described above. Immunoblots were scanned, and the band intensity was measured using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). Quantification was performed with results from three separate experiments. DNA Binding Assay—Total cellular extract of PC12 cells was prepared using the lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol) as previously described (12Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Ng A.K. Chien W.W. Ng Y.P. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6728-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and incubated with 10 μg of SIE oligo-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the beads were washed extensively with the lysis buffer. The SIE bead-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody against STAT3. Promoter Luciferase Assay—PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 per well in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transfected with the corresponding reporter construct and STAT3, STAT3M, or empty vector in a ratio of 1:9. β-Galactosidase-pCMV construct (25 ng, Clontech) was included in the transfection mix for normalization. Luciferase assay was performed 1 day after the transfection using a kit purchased from Promega, and β-galactosidase activity was measured using luminescent β-galactosidase enzyme kit (BD Biosciences). Luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity to correct for the variation in transfection efficiency. For cells transfected with siRNA, siRNA transfection was performed after 1 day of DNA transfection of the reporter constructs. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained for at least three independent experiments. Reverse Transcription-PCR, Southern and Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA of PC12 cells was extracted using acid guanidinium thiocyanate method as previously described (34Ip F.C. Fu A.K. Tsim K.W. Ip N.Y. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2393-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Total RNA was analyzed by formaldehyde RNA gel, and Northern hybridization against cDNA probes corresponding to partial sequence of egr-1, junB, or gapdh was performed as described previously. For the synthesis of cDNA, 5 μg of total RNA was mixed with 0.5 μm oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen) and denatured at 70 °C for 10 min. After cooling on ice, reverse transcription mixture (1× PCR buffer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units/ml Superscript II reverse transcriptase) was added. The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 50 min and terminated at 70 °C for 15 min. One-tenth of the cDNA mixture was used as the template for the subsequent PCR amplification. PCR primers were: cyclin D1, 5′-primer, 5′-ATGGAACACCAGCTCCTGTGC-3′, and 3′-primer, 5′-ATGTCCACATCTCGGA-3′; stat3, 5′ primer, 5′-ATTGACCTGCCGATGTCCCCCCGCACTTTAGATTCA-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TCACATCGGGGAGGTAGC-3′; gapdh, 5′ primer, 5′-TGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTG-3′, and 3′ primer, 5′-TCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGGCCAT-3′. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and then transferred onto nylon membranes. DNA blots were hybridized with appropriate probes and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. XAR-5 x-ray film at –80 °C overnight. Cell Proliferation Assay for Transfected PC12 Cells—PC12 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 per well in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transfected with the control or STAT3 siRNAs. Cells were treated with NGF for the times indicated. Growth of the transfected PC12 cells were measured by counting the number of cells using a hemocytometer. The 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine labeling method was performed to examine cell proliferation by measuring DNA replication in NGF-treated PC12 cells with or without STAT3 siRNA transfection. Cells were seeded and transfected as described. The transfected cells were treated with NGF for 4 days and then labeled with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine for 3 h. Cells were then fixed and stained as described (35Chow J.P. Siu W.Y. Ho H.T. Ma K.H. Ho C.C. Poon R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40815-40828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Neurite Extension in Hippocampal Neurons—Morphological analysis of transfected hippocampal neurons (DIV4) was performed using the images acquired with phase-contrast microscope (Zeiss). The length of the longest neurite was traced using MetaMorph Version 5.0r1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). For each measurement at least 50 cells per slide were counted from randomly selected fields and n = 3 slides. Each experiment was repeated three times. Statistical Analysis—Results from the morphological studies and luciferase assays were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Phosphorylation of STAT3 Was Induced by Neurotrophins in Neuronal Cells—PC12, a rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line, has been widely used as a model system for examining NGF-induced differentiation of neuronal cells due to its expression of TrkA and the well characterized downstream signaling triggered by NGF treatment. We have, therefore, adopted this cell line to examine the activation of STAT3 in response to NGF stimulation and the functional significance of STAT3 activation. In agreement with previous findings, treatment of PC12 cells with NGF induced rapid Erk1/2 activation (Fig. 1A (36Loeb D.M. Tsao H. Cobb M.H. Greene L.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1053-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, we found that NGF also induced Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 within 5 min. The levels of Ser(P) STAT3 remained elevated up to 30 min of NGF stimulation (Fig. 1A). It is noteworthy that Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was barely detected in PC12 cells before and after NGF stimulation (Fig. 1A). To determine whether neurotrophin treatment also induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in neurons, primary cortical neurons (DIV7) were treated with BDNF, and phosphorylation of STAT3 was also observed (Fig. 1B). Application of BDNF to cortical neurons for 5 min triggered phosphorylation of STAT3 at Ser-727 and Tyr-705. The level of Tyr(P) STAT3 declined after 15 min of BDNF treatment, but Ser(P) STAT3 remained elevated. Taken together, these results indicate that neurotrophins induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in neuronal cells. The induction of Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3 in cortical neurons may reflect the possibility that different regulatory mechanisms for STAT3 phosphorylation are involved in PC12 cells and in primary neurons. We next examined the subcellular localization of STAT3 and its phosphorylated forms after NGF treatment using immunocytochemistry. In untreated PC12 cells, STAT3 was located at both the cytoplasm and nuclei. Treatment with NGF for 10 min induced the translocation of STAT3 to the growth cones (Fig. 1C). Using the phospho-specific antibodies of STAT3, we found that before NGF treatment, Ser(P) STAT3 and Tyr(P) STAT3 expression was undetectable. Upon NGF stimulation, Ser(P) STAT3 was localized to the cytoplasm, nuclei, and growth cones of PC12 neurites, but Tyr(P) STAT3 remained below detectable level (Fig. 1C, right panel). Our data, therefore, verified that in PC12 cells NGF treatment mainly resulted in Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3. NGF Stimulation Induced Increases in DNA Binding and Transcriptional Activity of STAT3—Because the relative importance of Ser-727 and Tyr-705 phosphorylation of STAT3 on its transcriptional activity appears to vary depending on the cellular context, it is crucial for us to examine if the induction of Ser-727 phosphorylation of STAT3 by NGF affects STAT3 activity. We first examined if NGF treatment modulated the DNA binding activity of STAT3 using SIE oligo-agarose beads. We found that NGF induced STAT3 DNA binding in PC12 cells, which was not observed in the absence of NGF stimulation (Fig. 1D). When we stripped the blot and re-probed with phospho-specific STAT3 antibodies, only Ser(P) STAT3 (Fig. 1D), but not Tyr(P) STAT3 (data not shown), was detected. Because STAT3 can form heterodimer with STAT1, we used a STAT1-specific antibody to examine if the association between STAT3 and SIE oligo involved STAT1/STAT3 heterodimer. STAT1 could not be detected in the SIE oligo-agarose bead precipitated complex (Fig. 1D), suggesting that NGF stimulation mainly led to STAT3 homodimerization. Acetylation of STAT3 at Lys-685 by p300 has recently been reported to be critical for cytokine-mediated dimerization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity of STAT3 (37Wang R. Cherukuri P. Luo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11528-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 38Yuan Z.L. Guan Y.J. Chatterjee D. Chin Y.E. Science. 2005; 307: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Because Ser-727 of STAT3 is suggested to play a crucial role in the association of STAT3 with p300 upon cytokine stimulation (17Schuringa J.J. Schepers H. Vellenga E. Kruijer W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37Wang R. Cherukuri P. Luo J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 325: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the induction of STAT3 Ser-727 phosphorylation by NGF might affect the association of p300 with STAT3, thereby modulating its transcriptional activity. Consistent with this notion, we found that STAT3 associated with p300 after 15 min of NGF treatment, whereas no interaction between these two molecules was observed in the absence of NGF (Fig. 1E). Our data, therefore, demonstrated that not only did NGF treatment induce phosphorylation of STAT3, but it also facilitated association of STAT3 with p300, enabling potential acetylation and activation of STAT3 in PC12 cells. The association of STAT3 with SIE oligo and p300 together with the induction of Ser-727 phosphorylation only in the presence of NGF indicates that NGF treatment initiated STAT3 transcription in PC12 cells. To further characterize if NGF also affects STAT3 transcriptional activity, PC12 cells were transfected with luciferase construct linked to the STAT3-response enhancer element (pSTAT3-Luc). Corroborating with the NGF-induced binding of STAT3 to SIE oligo, NGF treatment induced the promoter activity of STAT3 (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our data demonstrated that NGF could induce both STAT3 DNA"

Here we examine the histone H3 post-translational modifications occurring at the promoters of key adipogenic genes during adipocyte differentiation. We show that the promoters of apM1, glut4, gpd1, and leptin are enriched in dimethylated histone H3 Lys4 (H3-K4) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, where none of these genes are yet expressed. A detailed study of the apM1 locus shows that H3-K4 dimethylation is restricted to the promoter region in undifferentiated cells and associates with RNA polymerase II (pol II) loading. The beginning of apM1 transcription at the early stages of adipogenesis coincides with promoter H3 hyperacetylation and H3-K4 trimethylation. At the coding region, H3 acetylation and dimethylation, as well as pol II binding, are found in cells at later stages of differentiation, when apM1 transcription reaches its maximal peak. This same pattern of histone modifications is detected in mouse primary preadipocytes and adipocytes but not in a related fibroblast cell line that is not committed to an adipocyte fate. Inhibition of H3-K4 methylation by treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with methylthioadenosine results in decreased apM1 gene expression as well as decreased adipogenesis. Taken together, our data indicate that H3-K4 dimethylation and pol II binding to the promoter of key adipogenic genes are distinguishing marks of cells that have undergone determination to a preadipocyte stage.

The influence exerted by the post-translational modifications of histones over the regulation of gene expression has been extensively studied in the past few years. Numerous studies have shown a clear link between the pattern of histone modifications found at promoter regions and gene transcription, thus leading to the statement of the histone code hypothesis (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar), which postulates that the pattern of histone post-translational modifications in a locus considerably extends the amount of information conveyed by the genomic code. Histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation in promoter regions is closely correlated with gene activation in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, and transcriptionally active euchromatin regions are highly enriched in acetylated histones (1Jenuwein T.

O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Moreover, lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated in vivo, thus providing a further layer of complexity and exponentially increasing functional diversity (9Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4918-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lachner M. O'Sullivan R.J. Jenuwein T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The recent identification of LSD1, the first histone demethylase to be characterized, which shows specificity for the mono- or dimethylated lysine 4 residue of histone H3 (11Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C.

Therefore, histone methylation may play a role in acute regulation of gene expression, just like histone acetylation does. Histone acetylation and methylation can also be detected at the coding regions of genes, in some cases correlating with elongation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (7Schneider R. Bannister A.J.

Thus, epigenetics has become a factor that cannot be overlooked when unraveling the regulation of gene transcription in cells, either acutely during interphase or programmatically throughout complex processes of development and differentiation.Adipogenesis, or the development of adipocytes from undifferentiated precursor cells, is a complex process that has been extensively studied at the hormonal and transcriptional levels. Mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblasts provide an in vitro model that recapitulates faithfully the main steps of the in vivo differentiation process (17Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). A well established hormonal stimulation initiates differentiation in these cells by activating a cascade of transcription factors that culminates with activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and PPARγ (17Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). These two factors are the main regulators of adipocyte gene expression and are between them responsible for the transcription in differentiated cells of many genes, including the adipokine apM1 (adiponectin) (18Iwaki M.

Thus, induction of high level PPARγ expression in fibroblasts requires recruitment of SWI/SNF to its hyperacetylated promoter (22Salma N. Xiao H. Mueller E. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4651-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). PPARγ, in its turn, recruits to its target promoters the histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein and p300, and this interaction is essential for adipocyte differentiation (23Chen S.

On the other hand, the retinoblastoma protein RB is associated with the histone deacetylase HDAC3 and blocks adipogenesis in cycling fibroblasts by binding to PPARγ, thus resulting in recruitment of deacetylase activity to the target promoters of the factor (25Fajas L.

In accordance with these results, histone deacetylase inhibitors have been recently shown to facilitate adipogenesis from undifferentiated fibroblasts (25Fajas L. Egler V. Reiter R. Hansen J.

Taken together, all of these data indicate that the post-translational modification of histones participates in the regulation of gene expression during the differentiation process of adipocytes.In the present study, we examine the pattern of histone H3 acetylation and methylation found across the adiponectin locus throughout adipocyte differentiation. We describe a role for histone H3-K4 dimethylation in recruiting Pol II and marking the adiponectin gene as “poised” for transcription in undifferentiated fibroblasts that do not yet express it. Decrease of the H3-K4 methylation mark at the apM1 promoter by incubation of the cells in the presence of an inhibitor of methyltransferase activity results in decreased expression of the gene and reduced adipogenesis. The same pattern can be extended to other adipogenic genes such as glut4 or gpd1 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Differentiation—Mouse 3T3-L1 and 10T1/2 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells to adipocytes was induced by treatment of 48 h postconfluent cells (designated D0) with an adipogenic mixture consisting of 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 0.5 mm IBMX (all reagents from Sigma) in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum. The differentiation medium was withdrawn 2 days later (D2) and replaced with medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml insulin. After 3 more days in insulin-containing medium (D5), the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum.In order to inhibit AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase activity during differentiation, 1 mm 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) was added to 3T3-L1 fibroblasts 24 h after reaching confluence (D1) and maintained for 24 h more (thus reaching D0). The medium was then changed to fresh medium containing insulin, dexamethasone, and IBMX as described above but supplemented in this case with 0.5 mm MTA. For the rest of the differentiation process, the medium was replaced every 24 h in order to add fresh MTA.Isolation of Mouse Preadipocytes and Adipocytes—Isolated epididymal fat tissue obtained from 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice was rinsed briefly with PBS and minced with a razor blade in collagenase solution (0.2 mg/ml collagenase A in 100 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 4.9 mm glucose, pH 7.4). The mixture was then allowed to digest for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The resulting cell suspension was allowed to settle for 5 min to separate into a supernatant containing adipocytes and an inferior layer composed mainly of preadipocytes. The adipocyte-containing supernatant was recovered by pipetting, and the infranatant was filtered through a 60-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to obtain the preadipocytes.Oil Red O Staining—To assess the progression of cytoplasmic fat accumulation, intracellular triglyceride was stained by Oil Red O (Sigma). Briefly, growing cells were washed gently with PBS and stained with Oil Red O solution (0.36% Oil Red O in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 1 h at 37 °C. Excess stain was removed with 60% isopropyl alcohol, and cells were washed with water before being photographed under a light microscope.RNA Isolation, Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Random-primed cDNA synthesis was performed at 37 °C starting with 1 μg of RNA, using the high capacity cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Adiponectin gene expression was measured by real time PCR in an ABI Prism 7900HT real time PCR system using the DNA double strand-specific SYBR green I dye for detection (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized to abl1 expression levels. Expression levels of the other genes studied were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Gene products of interest were co-amplified with an internal control gene (β-actin or tbp (TATA-box-binding protein)) at a low cycle number to ensure that the two products were in the exponential phase of amplification. Amplification products were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained acrylamide gels, and low exposure images were analyzed using Image J software (28Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics International. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Primers were designed to span an intron using Primerselect 4.0 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) software. The primer sequences used are listed on supplemental Table 1.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—ChIPs were performed and analyzed as described (29Parrizas M. Maestro M.A. Boj S.F. Paniagua A. Casamitjana R. Gomis R. Rivera F. Ferrer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3234-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Parrizas M. Boj S.F. Luco R.F. Maestro M.A. Ferrer J. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 83: 61-71PubMed Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, in the case of 3T3-L1 cells and primary preadipocytes, cells fixed for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde were lysed with SDS (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). In the case of primary adipocytes, nuclei were prepared prior to SDS lysis by incubating the fixed cells in an adipocyte lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, 80 mm KCl, and 0.5% Igepal, pH 7.9) for 1 h at room temperature. DNA was sonicated to obtain 500–1000-bp fragments with a Branson 150 sonifier at 50% maximal power for six pulses of 30 s. The antibodies used were anti-acetyl-H3-K9/K14, anti-dimethyl-H3-K4, anti-trimethyl-H3-K4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and anti-Pol II C-terminal domain (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Protein A-Sepharose blocked with bovine serum albumin and salmon sperm DNA was used to immunoprecipitate the complexes, except in the case of the Pol II ChIPs that were recovered using pan-mouse IgG-Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech).ChIPs were analyzed by co-amplification of the PCR product of interest with both a positive control (the housekeeping β-actin or pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) promoters) and a negative control (ins2 (insulin II), glut2, or myod1, all of them genes that are expressed in neither fibroblasts nor adipocytes). Multiplex PCR conditions were adjusted to ensure nonsaturation kinetics and similar amplification efficiencies for all amplicons within a reaction. Primers were designed to amplify segments located in a region of ∼100 bp from the transcription initiation site of selected genes for analysis of promoter regions. In the case of apM1, primers were also designed within an exon and in the 3′-untranslated region zone for analysis of the coding and terminal regions, respectively. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1. Amplification products were run in a 12% acrylamide gel and stained with ethidium bromide, and low exposure images were analyzed using Image J software. Each PCR was performed at least twice with samples resulting from three independent ChIP experiments.Acid Extraction of Histones and Western Blotting—3T3-L1 cells at different days of the differentiation process were scraped into ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.9). Hydrochloric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.2 n, and samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The clarified lysates containing acid-soluble proteins were dialyzed sequentially against 0.1 n acetic acid and H2O. Protein concentration was determined with the μBCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 16% SDS-PAGE using the Tris-Tricine buffer system and transferred to a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The primary antibodies were diluted 1:2,000 in PBS supplemented with 1% nonfat milk and visualized by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Chemiluminescence was detected using the ECL reagents (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), in a LAS3000 Lumi-Imager (Fuji Photo Film Inc., Valhalla, NY).Immunocytochemistry—Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells were plated on 4-well LabTek chambers (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) the day before staining. Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes growing in 6-well dishes were trypsinized, and 5,000 cells were placed onto glass slides using a cytospin centrifuge. Cells were fixed in 9:1 ethanol/acetic acid for 1 min, rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (diluted 1:1,000) were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a wet chamber. Slides were then washed with PBS and incubated with the fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) at a final dilution of 1:500 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed in PBS, the preparations were mounted and coverslipped using FA mounting fluid (Difco). Images were collected using a Leica DC-300F fluorescence microscope and processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San José, CA).Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance of the changes of histone modifications detected at the apM1 promoter throughout adipogenesis was assessed by two-tailed Student's t test using the mean ± S.D. calculated from six independent determinations performed for each differentiation day and obtained from three separate experiments performed in duplicate. Correlation coefficients that assess the linear association between transcriptional activity and promoter acetylation or methylation were computed between the log-transformed real time RT-PCR values for the apM1 RNA at different days of the differentiation process and the log-transformed densitometric analysis of each modification at the same day, referred to the level of that same modification found at the actb (β-actin) promoter, which was co-amplified and used as an endogenous control for immunoprecipitation efficiency.RESULTSDimethylation of Histone H3-K4 Is the First Modification Observed at the Promoters of Adipogenic Genes during Adipocyte Differentiation—The mouse 3T3-L1 cell line is frequently used as a model to study adipocyte differentiation. The striking morphological and transcriptomic changes taking place during this process have been extensively detailed (31Sadowski H.B. Wheeler T.T. Young D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4722-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), but the role of histone post-translational modifications has not yet been thoroughly established. We focused our attention on a set of genes that are activated throughout adipogenesis. The adipokines apM1 and leptin, the glucose transporter glut4, and the enzyme gpd1 were not expressed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts; transcription of these genes started during the early stages of adipogenesis, slowly rising and reaching a peak in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1A). The adiponectin receptors adipor1 and adipor2 and the enzyme sod2 (superoxide dismutase, mitochondrial), on the other hand, were already expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, although at low levels; transcription of these genes increased steadily throughout adipogenesis (Fig. 1A). We studied the presence of histone H3-K9/K14 acetylation, usually considered to be a mark for transcriptional activation (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar, 33Roh T.Y. Cuddapah S. Zhao K. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 542-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), at the promoter region of the apM1 gene in 3T3-L1 cells at different days of the differentiation process by means of ChIP assays. Interestingly, H3-K9/K14 acetylation was not detected in undifferentiated fibroblasts, slowly rising and reaching a peak in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1B, top). This pattern closely mirrors the expression profile of the apM1 gene.Another histone modification linked to transcriptional activation, H3-K4 trimethylation, followed a pattern similar to that of acetylation, with trimethylation slightly preceding the appearance of acetylation on the same region (Fig. 1B, middle). In contrast, H3-K4 dimethylation was already detected in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells and increased throughout adipogenesis, following a biphasic pattern (Fig. 1B, bottom). A similar study of the promoters of glut4, gpd1, and leptin shows that this temporal sequence of events is conserved in those other genes, with H3-K4 dimethylation the only mark detected in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, the promoter regions of adipor1, adipor2, and sod2, which were already expressed in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, were associated with hyperacetylated histone H3 in addition to dimethylated H3-K4 in undifferentiated cells. Moreover, H3-K4 trimethylation was also detected at the promoters of sod2 and adipor1 but not adipor2 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. However, the levels of histone acetylation and di- and trimethylation of these promoters increased slightly in mature adipocytes, coinciding with the maximal transcription of the genes, particularly in the case of adipor1 and adipor2 (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1).To strengthen the link between active transcription and histone acetylation and methylation, we examined the promoter of pref1 (preadipocyte factor-1), a gene that is expressed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells but whose expression decreases throughout adipogenesis and is finally silenced in mature adipocytes (34Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). At the promoter of pref1, all of these histone modifications associated with transcription were detected in undifferentiated fibroblasts but steadily decreased as adipogenesis progressed and transcription of the gene was silenced. In mature adipocytes, only low levels of H3-K4 dimethylation could be detected at the silenced pref1 promoter, as a lingering mark of past transcriptional events on that locus (supplemental Fig. 1).To check if this recurring pattern is a peculiarity of this cell line or if it is also found in vivo, we isolated primary mouse preadipocytes and adipocytes. apM1 was not expressed in preadipocytes but was highly expressed in mature mouse adipocytes (Fig. 2A). Supporting our findings with 3T3-L1 cells, the promoter region of the gene was already dimethylated in preadipocytes, whereas the three histone modifications studied were detected at the same region in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2The same pattern of histone modifications is detected in primary preadipocytes and adipocytes.

https://openalex.org/W1979414872,"Insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is found in obesity and type 2 diabetes. A mechanism for impaired insulin signaling in peripheral tissues is the inhibition of insulin action through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (Irs) proteins that abolish the coupling of Irs proteins to the activated insulin receptor. Recently, we described serine-318 as a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation site in Irs1 (Ser-318) activated by hyperinsulinemia. Here we show in various cell models that the adipose hormone leptin, a putative mediator in obesity-related insulin resistance, promotes phosphorylation of Ser-318 in Irs1 by a janus kinase 2, Irs2, and PKC-dependent pathway. Mutation of Ser-318 to alanine abrogates the inhibitory effect of leptin on insulin-induced Irs1 tyrosine phosphorylation and glucose uptake in L6 myoblasts. In C57Bl/6 mice, Ser-318 phosphorylation levels in muscle tissue were enhanced by leptin and insulin administration in lean animals while in diet-induced obesity Ser-318 phosphorylation levels were already up-regulated in the basal state, and further stimulation was diminished. In analogy, in lymphocytes of obese hyperleptinemic human subjects basal Ser-318 phosphorylation levels were increased compared to lean individuals. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, the increment in Ser-318 phosphorylation observed in lean individuals was absent in obese. In summary, these data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-318 in Irs1 mediates the inhibitory signal of leptin on the insulin-signaling cascade in obese subjects."

The GRK1 subfamily consists of rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) and GRK7; the GRK2 subfamily consists of β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 and -2 (GRK2 and GRK3); and the GRK4 subfamily consists of GRK4–6. All GRKs have an ∼500-amino acid structural core consisting of a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) homology (RH) domain (4Siderovski D.P. Hessel A. Chung S. Mak T.W. Tyers M. Curr.

However, each GRK subfamily has distinct N and C termini containing elements known to regulate kinase activity and to mediate membrane targeting (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

The GRK1 subfamily is thus far found only in vertebrates. To date, the defining structural features of the GRK family have been surmised primarily through crystal structures of only one member, bovine GRK2. In the crystal structures of GRK2 (9Lodowski D.T.

Tesmer J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), the RH and kinase domains of GRK2 are intimately associated via a bipartite interaction that is reminiscent of the inhibited structures of Src family tyrosine kinases (12Xu W.

Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the GRK2 RH domain has two additional protein interaction sites. The first binds the C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of GRK2, by which the enzyme is recruited to the membrane via binding activated Gβγ subunits (16Haga K. Haga T. J. Biol.

Based on how PH domains and Gβγ are expected to associate with lipid bilayers, a membrane-bound orientation was proposed for GRK2 (10Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). However, it was not known if the structural and functional correlates established for GRK2 necessarily apply to the other GRK subfamilies, which do not have PH domains and are not known to bind directly to Gα subunits (19Carman C.V. Parent J.L. Day P.W. Pronin A.N. Sternweis P.M. Wedegaertner P.B. Gilman A.G. Benovic J.L. Kozasa T. J. Biol.

Whereas the GRK kinase domain is relatively well conserved among the subfamilies (∼45% sequence identity), the RH domain is much less so (∼27% identity), and the GRK N and C termini have little or no sequence homology. Therefore, the structure and interdomain contacts of the RH-kinase domain core, the kinase domain conformation, and the membrane orientation in other GRK subfamilies could be substantially different. Moreover, it is not clear whether the RH domains of GRK1 and GRK4 subfamily members will serve a role in mediating intermolecular protein-protein interactions. To address these issues, we determined the 2.6-Å crystal structure of GRK6, the most ubiquitously expressed member of the GRK4 subfamily (3Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Aparicio S.A. Kendall H.E.

Unlike any of the GRK2 structures, the GRK6 crystal structure was determined in complex with AMPPNP, illuminating details of the GRK active site that may be important for the development of GRK-selective kinase inhibitors. We compare the arrangement of the RH and kinase domains of GRK6 with those of GRK2 and assess the significance of an extensive, hydrophobic dimer interface formed by the GRK6 RH domain. One end of the predicted peptide-binding channel of GRK6 appears to be blocked by a loop within its kinase domain, and a putative phospholipid-binding site is revealed near the N terminus of the enzyme. Expression and Purification of GRK6—To ensure a homogeneous preparation of GRK6 and to eliminate the need for detergent during the protein purification, human GRK6 was expressed in both Sf9 and High5 insect cells as a soluble, palmitoylation-deficient mutant in which three potential palmitoylation sites (located at Cys561, Cys562, and Cys565) were converted to Ser (33Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27422-27427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This mutant protein retains its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin, albeit with a 5-fold higher Km and 2-fold lower Vmax compared with those of wild-type GRK6 (33Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27422-27427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At ∼48 h post-viral addition, 4–6 liters of infected cells were pelleted and resuspended in ∼80 ml of ice-cold harvesting buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm leupeptin, 2 mm lima bean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone. The suspended cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. GRK6 was purified with the same protocol used for GRK2 (34Lodowski D.T. Barnhill J.F. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although GRK6 eluted from the final Source S column at ∼130 mm NaCl, as opposed to 140 mm for GRK2. After gel filtration on a Superdex 200 16/600 preparative column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, GRK6 was pooled, concentrated to 12 mg/ml in a 50-kDa cutoff Centriprep filter (Millipore Corp.), and flash-frozen as 50-μl pellets in liquid nitrogen. The yield of pure GRK6 varied from 2 to 4 mg/liter of culture. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of the purified GRK6 protein yielded a molecular mass of 66,050 Da, slightly larger than expected (65,986 Da for acetylated, full-length, palmitoylation-deficient GRK6). This could indicate that GRK6 is post-translationally modified (e.g. via phosphorylation) when expressed in insect cells, as is GRK2 (7Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.J. Freeman J.L. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Crystallization—GRK6 was crystallized at 4 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 4 mm AMPPNP (final concentration). The presence of Mg2+·AMPPNP was required for crystallization. The drop consisted of 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of well solution containing 100 mm succinic, malic, or citric acid (pH 4.9–5.1), 8.7–10.8% polyethylene glycol 3350, 4 mm MgCl2, 5% ethylene glycol, and 500 mm NaCl. Crystals appeared in 5 days and grew over the course of 2–3 weeks as stacks of thin plates, with maximum dimensions of 1 × 0.3 ×<0.05 mm. GRK6 crystals belong to the space group C2, with unit cell parameters a = 120.2, b = 59.3, and c = 221.1 Å and β = 102.6°, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data Collection and Structure Determination—Crystals were harvested by excising single plates with an eye knife (BD Biosciences) and transferred by CryoLoop into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm fumaric acid (pH 5.0), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm AMPPNP, 9.45% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 5% ethylene glycol. The crystals were then stepped through a gradient of ethylene glycol (3.25% increments up to 20% final) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction maxima were collected from crystals maintained at 100 K at Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 on an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector. To avoid overlaps due to the long c cell axis, which was perpendicular to the plane of the crystal plates, it was necessary to crimp the base of the crystal mounting pin by ∼45° while in the cryostream. Diffraction maxima were collected in two sweeps using 0.5° or 0.75° oscillations and 7- or 8-s exposures, respectively, for a total of 220° (368 images). During this process, the crystal was translated once in the beam to extend data collection. The data were reduced and scaled using ELVES (35Holton J. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1537-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and associated programs from CCP4 (36Winn M.D. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2003; 10: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and solved by molecular replacement as implemented by the program Phaser (37Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar), with the RH and kinase domains of GRK2 serving as search models (Protein Data Bank code 1OMW). Data sets were also collected from crystals soaked with 17 mm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) or 4 mm glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) peptide (38Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, electron density was not observed for either molecule. Modeling—The molecular replacement model was refined for two cycles of simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement in CNS_SOLVE (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) to reduce phase bias. The GRK6 model was then refined using both 2-fold NCS restraints and TLS groups in REFMAC5 (36Winn M.D. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2003; 10: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After each round of refinement, the model was manually fit into σA-weighted electron density maps using the molecular graphics program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the model was monitored using PROCHECK (41Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Atomic representations and electrostatic surfaces were created with PyMOL (42DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. 2002; (DeLano Scientific LLC, San Carlos, CA)Google Scholar) and APBS (43Baker N.A. Sept D. Joseph S. Holst M.J. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10037-10041Crossref PubMed Scopus (5905) Google Scholar). Functional Analysis of the RH Dimerization Interface—To create the wild-type GRK6 expression vector pcDNA3-GRK6A, a 2038-bp fragment of human GRK6 cDNA (23Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was excised with EcoRI and ligated into EcoRI-digested pcDNA3. Single mutations I39E, I165E, and F527D and double mutations I39E/I165E and I165E/F527D were made in pcDNA3-GRK6 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the full coding region of the resulting vector was sequenced for verification. GRK6 and its mutants were partially purified from transiently transfected COS-1 cells and analyzed in phosphorylation reactions following previously described procedures (44Pronin A.N. Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After standardizing protein levels by Western analysis with a mouse anti-GRK4–6 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), GRK6 and its mutants were assayed in phosphorylation reactions containing light-exposed, urea-stripped rod outer segments. Parallel reactions performed in the dark did not reveal rhodopsin phosphorylation. Chemiluminescence detection (Western blotting) and PhosphorImager analysis (phosphorylation assay) were performed using a Typhoon imaging system and analyzed with ImageQuant software. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Palmitoylation-deficient GRK6 samples were prepared at three concentrations (corresponding to A280 = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.6) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed in an An50Ti rotor at 4 °C at three rotor speeds (10,000, 15,000 and 25,000 rpm) in a Beckman XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge. Data were analyzed using Ultrascan Version 7.2 software (available at www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu) by modeling the sample as a single ideal solute with a calculated partial specific volume of 0.735 ml/g to obtain a buoyant molecular mass of 60 ± 1 kDa and a variance of 1.4 × 10–5. This result suggests that GRK6 (expected molecular mass of 66 kDa) is predominantly monomeric at each concentration tested. Gel filtration analysis performed at a higher concentration (40 μm) was also consistent with a monomeric protein. The crystal structure of the human GRK6·AMPPNP complex was determined using diffraction data extending to 2.6-Å spacings, with phases provided by molecular replacement (Table 1). Two monomers of GRK6 (chains A and B) are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystals and form a homodimer that buries 2700 Å2 of accessible surface area (Fig. 1). The final model contains residues 24–474 and 492–532 in chain A and residues 24–387, 391–473, and 492–535 in chain B (supplemental Fig. S1). Mass spectroscopic analysis of the protein used for crystallization suggests that the missing regions are disordered and not proteolyzed. The missing residues from positions 474/475 to 491 in each chain correspond to the so-called “nucleotide gate” region of the kinase domain (45Narayana N. Cox S. Nguyen-huu X. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 921-935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which was similarly disordered in structures of GRK2. A polyvalent anion modeled as inorganic phosphate is bound to residues near the basic N terminus of the protein (Fig. 1), which may represent part of an anionic phospholipid-binding site in each monomer (46Pitcher J.A. Fredericks Z.L. Stone W.C. Premont R.T. Stoffel R.H. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24907-24913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Discontinuous but strong electron density was observed adjacent to the phosphate anion in each chain and was tentatively modeled as residues 14–16 of each GRK6 monomer due to its proximity to Lys24, the first identified residue in each chain. However, this density could also correspond to residues from the C terminus of each chain, which are also nearby and disordered.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsCrystallographic data X-ray sourceALS beamline 8.3.1 Wavelength (Å)1.000 Resolution (Å)2.6 Space groupC2 Cell constantsa = 120.2, b = 59.3, and c = 221.1 Å; β = 102.6° Unique reflections46,028 (6200)aNumbers in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell of data (2.74 to 2.6 Å).

Open table in a new tab The region of greatest sequence conservation among GRKs is the kinase domain, which spans residues 180–507 in GRK6. As in other protein kinases, the catalytic site of the GRK6 kinase domain is situated in a cleft between a “small lobe” (residues 180–318 and 492–507) and a “large lobe” (residues 319–471) (Fig. 1). Despite the presence of Mg2+·AMPPNP in the active site (Fig. 2), the kinase domain of GRK6 crystallized in an “open,” inactive conformation with a disordered nucleotide gate. This is atypical for an AGC kinase, wherein the binding of nucleotide analogs correlates well with kinase domain closure and ordering of the nucleotide gate region (15Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Upon superimposing the small lobes of GRK6 and GRK2, their large lobes are rotated ∼10° with respect to each other. However, neither assumes a more “closed” conformation because both require an ∼18° rotation to match the AMP-PNP-bound conformation of PKB (supplemental Fig. S2) (38Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In either case, the axis of rotation required to achieve the closed conformation is roughly parallel to the αD helix of the kinase domain, passing adjacent to GRK6 Ser328 (GRK2 Ser334) within the active site. The structure of AMPPNP bound in the GRK6 active site allows comparison of a GRK catalytic site with other AGC kinases (38Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 47Bossemeyer D. Engh R.A. Kinzel V. Ponstingl H. Huber R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). As in PKA or PKB, the catalytic lysine residue (Lys215) interacts with the α- and β-phosphates of the ATP analog, and the purine ring fits snuggly into a hydrophobic specificity pocket. Only weak density for one of the two expected magnesium ions is observed in GRK6, perhaps because active-site residues donated by the large lobe (e.g. Asn316 and Asp329, both of which coordinate magnesium) are displaced due to the open conformation of the kinase domain. Thus, the active-site cleft presented by nucleotide-bound GRKs is substantially broader than that of nucleotide-bound PKA or PKB (Fig. 3, compare A and D). Furthermore, the position of the triphosphate tail and associated glycine-rich “P-loop” is shifted by 2–3 Å toward the large lobe relative to that of AMPPNP-bound PKA or PKB (Fig. 2) and has the same conformation as it does in the nucleotide-free structures of GRK2. Therefore, no evidence exists for a conformational change in this loop upon binding ATP, as there is in PKA and other protein kinases (15Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 48Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this difference is not clear, although we speculate that it could be due to substitutions within the adjacent αB helix. The αD–αE and αF–αG loops of the GRK6 large lobe correspond to loops in other characterized AGC kinases that form the walls of the peptide-binding channel. In GRK6, these loops are 2 and 1 residue(s) longer, respectively, than in GRK2 (supplemental Fig. S1) and adopt strikingly different conformations. In the GRK6 A chain, 387QRKKK391 of the αF–αG loop obstruct the end of the peptide channel where the N terminus of peptides bind to PKA and PKB. In contrast, 388RKK390 in the B chain are disordered. This difference probably results from the facts that the A chain is generally better ordered than the B chain and that the A chain αF–αG loop is directly stabilized by a crystal contact. It is possible that this contact could also influence the structure of the αF–αG loop. However, the positions of residues 387 and 391 in the B chain strongly suggest that their intervening residues also most occupy the peptide channel. Thus, either GRK6 binds substrates in a manner that is not strictly analogous to how PKB binds the GSK3β peptide (Fig. 3) (38Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D."
https://openalex.org/W2108191968,"Calcium concentration within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an essential role in cell physiopathology. One of the most enigmatic mechanisms responsible for Ca2+ concentration in the ER is passive calcium leak. Previous studies have shown that the translocon complex is permeable to calcium. However, the involvement of the translocon in the passive calcium leak has not been directly demonstrated. Furthermore, the question whether the passive store depletion via the translocon could activate SOC (store operated channels) replenishing the ER, remains still unresolved. In this study, for the first time, we show that thapsigargin and calcium chelators deplete ER via translocon. Indeed, using confocal imaging, we demonstrate that when the number of opened translocons was lowered neither thapsigargin nor calcium chelators could induce ER store depletion. We also demonstrate that calcium leakage occurring via the translocon activates store-operated current, which is, by its kinetic and pharmacology, similar to that evoked by thapsigargin and EGTA (but not IP3), thus highlighting our hypothesis that calcium leakage via the translocon is a first step for activation of the specific iPLA2-regulated SOC. As the translocon is present in yeast and mammalian cells, our findings suggest that translocon-related calcium signaling is a common phenomenon."

In HEK293 cells stably expressing AT1 receptor-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), MAS-yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression from an inducible locus caused strong up-regulation of AT1 receptor-CFP amounts and [3H]angiotensin II binding levels. The time course of AT1 receptor-CFP up-regulation was also markedly slower than that of induction of MAS expression. These effects were not mimicked by induced expression of I138D MAS-YFP, a mutant unable to cause constitutive loading of [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) onto the phospholipase Cβ-linked G protein Gα11. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and the selective Gαq/Gα11 inhibitor YM-254890 fully blocked MAS-induced up-regulation of AT1 receptor-CFP amounts, whereas the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate produced strong up-regulation of AT1 receptor-CFP without induction of MAS-YFP expression and in the presence of I138D MAS-YFP.

II is one of the key components of the renin-angiotensin system and, as such, plays a major role in the regulation of blood pressure and cardiovascular homeostasis (1Fleming I. Kohlstedt K. Busse R.

Ang II exerts its effects through at least two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) receptors. Whereas the functional role of the AT2 receptor is not fully understood (2Carey R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2005; 14: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3Reudelhuber T.L.

However, in a number of situations, the AT1 receptor is modulated by other coexpressed GPCRs. For example, interactions with the AT2 receptor have been demonstrated in which the AT2 receptor acts as a functional antagonist of the AT1 receptor (5AbdAlla S. Lother H. Abdel-tawab A.M.

However, although suggested in early studies to be a potential candidate as an Ang II receptor (10Jackson T.R. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Goedert M. Hanley M.R. Nature. 1998; 335: 437-440Crossref Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11Jackson T.R. Hanley M.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it remained an “orphan” until recently, when it was demonstrated that the Ang II metabolite Ang-(1–7) is an endogenous agonist of MAS (12Santos R.A. Simoes e Silva A.C. Maric C. Silva D.M. Machado R.P. de Buhr I. Heringer-Walther S. Pinheiro S.V. Lopes M.T. Bader M. Mendes E.P. Lemos V.S. Campagnole-Santos M.J. Schultheiss H.P. Speth R. Walther T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8258-8263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). In the last decade, there has been emerging evidence that, although not able to bind or respond directly to Ang II, MAS has a physiological role in modulating the functions of Ang II in both the neuronal (13Von Bohlen Und Halbach O. Walther T. Bader M. Albrecht D. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and cardiovascular (14Kostenis E. Milligan G. Christopoulos A. Sanchez-Ferrer C.F. Heringer-Walther S. Sexton P. Gembardt F. Kellett E. Martini L. Vanderheyden P. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) systems. In MAS knock-out mice, AT1 receptor signaling is altered in the amygdala (13Von Bohlen Und Halbach O. Walther T. Bader M. Albrecht D. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 2012-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); and, recently, Castro et al. (15Castro C.H. Santos R.A. Ferreira A.J. Bader M. Alenina N. Almeida A.P. Hypertension. 2005; 46: 937-942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported functional interactions between MAS and both the AT1 and AT2 receptors in mouse heart. In a previous study, we showed that MAS and the AT1 receptor interact in heterologous expression systems and that MAS acts as an functional antagonist of the AT1 receptor both in cotransfected CHO-K1 cells and in mesenteric microvessels of mice because greater levels of Ang II-mediated contraction were observed in vessels from MAS knock-out mice compared with wild-type controls (14Kostenis E. Milligan G. Christopoulos A. Sanchez-Ferrer C.F. Heringer-Walther S. Sexton P. Gembardt F. Kellett E. Martini L. Vanderheyden P. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, although Ang II produced lower levels of inositol phosphate accumulation and reduced increases in intracellular [Ca2+] in CHO-K1 cells coexpressing MAS and the AT1 receptor compared with those expressing the AT1 receptor alone, we also observed that MAS coexpression with the AT1 receptor resulted in an increase in [3H]Ang II binding capacity (14Kostenis E. Milligan G. Christopoulos A. Sanchez-Ferrer C.F. Heringer-Walther S. Sexton P. Gembardt F. Kellett E. Martini L. Vanderheyden P. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MAS increases [3H]Ang II binding has remained elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that it is due to the constitutive capacity of MAS to stimulate the G proteins Gαq/Gα11 and hence the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and that this effect is cell type-independent. Materials—All materials for tissue culture were from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). The PKC inhibitor Ro 31-8220, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), doxycycline, and Ang II were from Sigma. GF 109203X was from Tocris (Avonmouth, UK), and YM-254890 was the kind gift of Astrellas Pharma Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To introduce amino acid substitutions into the primary structure of the human MAS receptor, site-directed mutagenesis of the encoding nucleotide sequence was performed using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were designed for the production of the I138D mutation (with the bases underlined): GTCCTTTACCCCGACTGGTACCGATGC (forward) and GCATCGGTACCAGTCGGGGTAAAGGAC (reverse). Flp-In Constructs—To create MAS receptor constructs N-terminally tagged with the vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) epitope sequence and fused at the C terminus with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), the human MAS receptor and I138D MAS were used as PCR templates. An oligonucleotide encoding a BamHI restriction site, the VSV-G epitope sequence, and the first 21 bases of the MAS receptor sequence was used as the forward primer (CGGGATCCATGTACACCGACATCGAAATGACCCGCCTTGGTAAGGATGGGTCAAACGTGACATCA), and an oligonucleotide containing the last 21 bases of the MAS sequence without its stop codon and a NotI restriction site was employed as the reverse primer (TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTGACGACAGTCTCAACTGTGACCGT). The PCR product was then inserted into vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) already containing YFP and previously digested with BamHI and NotI. c-Myc-AT1 receptor (AT1R)-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) was obtained using the same strategy as described above with the human AT1 receptor as a template; a forward primer encoding a HindIII restriction site, the c-Myc epitope sequence, and the first 21 bases of the receptor sequence (CCCAAGCTTATGGAACAAAAACTTATTTCTGAAGAAGATCTGATTCTCAACTCTTCTACTGAAGATTGG); and a reverse primer containing the last 21 bases of the AT1 receptor without its stop codon and a KpnI restriction site (CGGGGTACCCTCAACCTCAAAACATGGTGC). The PCR product was then inserted in pcDNA3.1 already containing CFP and previously digested with HindIII and KpnI. c-Myc-AT1R-YFP in pcDNA5/FRT/TO was subcloned by digesting c-Myc-AT1R-CFP with HindIII and KpnI and inserting it into pcDNA5/FRT/TO already containing YFP and previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The truncated form of the AT1 receptor, c-Myc-Δ325AT1R-CFP, was obtained using the same strategy as described above with the human AT1 receptor as a template. The same primer encoding a HindIII restriction site, the c-Myc epitope sequence, and the first 21 bases of the receptor sequence was used as the forward primer, and the reverse primer contained the last 21 bases up to amino acid 325 of the AT1 receptor without its stop codon and a KpnI restriction site (CGGGGTACCTTTTGGGGGAATATATTT). The PCR product was then inserted in pcDNA3.1 already containing CFP and previously digested with HindIII and KpnI. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.292 g/liter l-glutamine and 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were grown to 60–80% confluence before transient transfection. Transfection was performed using Effectene® transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc., West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/liter l-glutamine. Cells at 50–80% confluence were transfected transiently with the indicated cDNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Generation of Stable Flp-In™ T-REx™ HEK293 Cells—To generate Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells able to inducibly express the receptors of interest, the cells were transfected with a mixture containing the desired receptor cDNA in the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector and pOG44 vectors (1:9) using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell maintenance and selection were as described (16Milasta S. Pediani J. Appelebe S. Trim S. Wyatt M. Cox P. Fidock M. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Resistant clones were screened for receptor expression by both fluorescence and Western blotting. To induce expression of receptors cloned into the Flp-In locus, cells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline for varying periods of time. PKC activation and inhibition, as well as Gαq/Gα11 inhibition treatments, were performed 6 h after inducing the receptors for an overnight period. Live Cell Epifluorescence Microscopy—Cells expressing the appropriate receptors tagged with CFP or YFP were grown on poly-d-lysine-treated coverslips. The coverslips were placed into a microscope chamber containing physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4). Fluorescent images of the cells were acquired using a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) equipped with a ×40 (numerical aperture = 1.3) oil immersion Plan Fluor lens and a cooled digital CoolSNAPHQ charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) (see Ref. 17Carrillo J.J. López-Gimenez J.F. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1123-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar for details). Visualization of the Plasma Membrane—To fluorescently visualize the plasma membrane in live HEK293 cells expressing CFP- or YFP-fused receptors, cells were treated (as specified by the manufacturer) with the reagents in the Image-iT plasma membrane and nuclear labeling kit (Invitrogen), in which the plasma membrane is specifically labeled with wheat germ agglutinin-Alexa Fluor 594, and nuclei are stained simultaneously with Hoechst 33342. CFP and YFP were excited as described above, and Alexa Fluor 594 was excited at 575/12 nm and imaged using the following filter set: dichroic, Q595LP; and emitter, HQ645/75m. Using these filters, no bleed-through was observed, and the resultant sequential 12-bit images were overlaid using MetaMorph software (Version 6.3.5, Universal Imaging Corp., Downingtown, PA). For three-dimensional imaging, stacks of images (2 × 2 binning, 150–200-ms exposure/image) with a 0.339-μm Z step (∼20–25 frames/stack) were sequentially acquired for each fluorescent dye. [35S]GTPγS Binding—[35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of membranes to assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm GDP, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, and 100 nCi of [32S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of receptor ligands. Nonspecific binding was determined under the same conditions but in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm ascorbic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% SDS. Samples were precleared with Pansorbin (Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK), followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum CQ (18Mitchell F.M. Mullaney I. Godfrey P.P. Arkinstall S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Cell-surface Receptor Measurement and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Cells were grown in 96-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates and induced with different concentrations of doxycycline for 24 h. Afterward, cell-surface receptors were labeled with anti-VSV-G antibody (1:1000) in growth medium for 30 min at 30 °C. The cells were then washed once with 20 mm HEPES and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for another 30 min at 37 °C in growth medium supplemented with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody and 1 μm Hoechst nuclear stain (Sigma) to determine the number of cells in each well. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the Hoechst fluorescence was measured. Finally, the cells were incubated with SureBlue (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 5 min in the dark at room temperature, and the absorbance was read at 620 nm using a VICTOR2 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Endoglycosidase Treatment—Endoglycosidase treatment was carried out overnight at 32 °C using peptide N-glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at a final concentration of 1 unit/μl. Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were obtained by harvesting the cells with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 5% ethylene glycol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), pH 7.4). Cell extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. After samples were heated at 65 °C for 15 min, cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis using 4–12% BisTris gels (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and MOPS buffer. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were incubated in a solution of 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature on a rotating shaker for 2 h to block nonspecific binding sites. The membrane was incubated overnight with anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, Hertfordshire, UK) or anti-VSV-G antiserum and detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG secondary antiserum (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Immunoblots were developed by application of enhanced chemiluminescence solution (Pierce). Cell-surface Biotinylation Experiments—For cell-surface biotinylation, cells were grown in 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine and induced as described. Confluent cells were washed with ice-cold borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, and 1.8 CaCl2, pH 9.0) and incubated on ice with 1 ml of 0.8 mm EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) in borate buffer for 15 min. The cells were then rinsed with a solution of 0.192 m glycine and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, to quench the excess biotin and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was recovered. An aliquot of the lysates was saved for Western blotting. Cell-surface biotinylated proteins were isolated using 100 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C with constant rotation, samples were spun, and the streptavidin beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Finally, the biotinylated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of SDS sample buffer for 1 h at 37 °C, and SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described above. Intact Cell Radioligand Binding Assays—Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells expressing the wild-type or I138D MAS receptor with the constitutively expressed AT1 receptor were subcultured in 6-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine and grown to confluence. Each well was washed twice with prewarmed Krebs-Ringer buffer (145 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaPO4, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Then, the Krebs-Ringer buffer was replaced with 0.8 ml of prewarmed [3H]Ang II (Amersham Biosciences) in Krebs-Ringer buffer supplemented with 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled Ang II. After 30 min at 37 °C (5% CO2 and 95% air), each well was washed twice with ice-cold Krebs-Ringer buffer, and the cells were solubilized by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH and 2% (w/v) SDS and incubated overnight at room temperature (20–25 °C). 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl was added to each well to neutralize the NaOH. The samples were mixed, and 1.6 ml was mixed with scintillation mixture and counted (Packard 2000 CA scintillation counter) to measure bound [3H]Ang II. The remaining cell lysates from each well were pooled and used for protein determination. A radioligand concentration of 10 nm [3H]Ang II was used for single point studies. We recently reported that coexpression of the GPCR MAS with the AT1 receptor in CHO-K1 cells results in a decreased capacity of Ang II to increase intracellular [Ca2+] and inositol phosphate accumulation (14Kostenis E. Milligan G. Christopoulos A. Sanchez-Ferrer C.F. Heringer-Walther S. Sexton P. Gembardt F. Kellett E. Martini L. Vanderheyden P. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, however, this is associated with an increase in [3H]Ang II-binding sites, although MAS does not bind this ligand (14Kostenis E. Milligan G. Christopoulos A. Sanchez-Ferrer C.F. Heringer-Walther S. Sexton P. Gembardt F. Kellett E. Martini L. Vanderheyden P. Schultheiss H.P. Walther T. Circulation. 2005; 111: 1806-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We resolved to explore the molecular basis for this up-regulation of Ang II binding. Generation of Flp-In T-REx HEK293 Cell Lines—A Flp-In T-REx HEK293 clonal cell line was established in which a form of the human AT1 receptor C-terminally tagged with CFP and N-terminally tagged with the c-Myc epitope sequence (c-Myc-AT1R-CFP) was expressed stably and constitutively. These cells also harbored, at the Flp-In locus, a form of human MAS C-terminally tagged with YFP and N-terminally tagged with the VSV-G epitope sequence (VSV-G-MAS-YFP). The Flp-In locus ensures a single defined site of chromosomal integration; and in the T-REx form of these cells, expression from this locus is controlled in a Tet-on-inducible fashion by the addition of either tetracycline or the related antibiotic doxycycline (16Milasta S. Pediani J. Appelebe S. Trim S. Wyatt M. Cox P. Fidock M. Milligan G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the absence of doxycycline, cell imaging demonstrated expression of c-Myc-AT1R-CFP predominantly in punctate intracellular vesicles, likely to represent recycling endosomes, and a lack of expression of VSV-G-MAS-YFP (Fig. 1A). The addition of doxycycline (0.1 μg/ml, 24 h) resulted in induction of VSV-G-MAS-YFP expression. This receptor construct had an unusual, widespread, cellular distribution, with at least some of the YFP signal overlapping with the nucleus (Fig. 1B). With expression of VSV-G-MAS-YFP, the fluorescent signal corresponding to c-Myc-AT1R-CFP was markedly increased (Fig. 1B), with much of the signal apparently inside the cell. MAS Constitutively Activates Gα11—Transient transfection of MAS into HEK293 cells along with the phospholipase Cβ-linked G protein Gα11 resulted in loading of ∼4-fold greater amounts of [35S]GTPγS onto the G protein than observed in the absence of MAS, consistent with the substantial ligand-independent, constitutive activity of this GPCR (Fig. 2). We have demonstrated previously that mutation of key hydrophobic residues in the second intracellular loop of many rhodopsin-like class A GPCRs ablates their capacity to activate cognate G proteins (18Mitchell F.M. Mullaney I. Godfrey P.P. Arkinstall S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42578-42587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Conversion of Ile138 to Asp in MAS (I138D MAS) and expression of this form of the receptor with Gα11 failed to enhance [35S]GTPγS binding to the G protein (Fig. 2). I138D MAS Is Delivered to the Cell Surface but Does Not Up-regulate the AT1 Receptor—Based on the ability of the I138D mutation to eliminate constitutive MAS-induced loading of [35S]GTPγS onto Gα11, we generated additional Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cell lines that constitutively expressed c-Myc-AT1R-CFP but also harbored VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP at the Flp-in locus (Fig. 3A). Induction of VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP expression by treatment with doxycycline resulted in a completely different distribution pattern compared with VSV-G-MAS-YFP. The I138D MAS construct appeared to be located largely at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). Expression of VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP neither up-regulated c-Myc-AT1R-CFP nor markedly altered its cellular distribution (Fig. 3B). To confirm substantially more effective plasma membrane localization of VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP, we performed a series of intact cell anti-VSV-G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Although induction of VSV-G-MAS-YFP expression with increasing concentrations of doxycycline resulted in little increase in anti-VSV-G cell-surface immunoreactivity (Fig. 3C), a clear, doxycycline concentration-dependent increase in signal was obtained when VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP expression was induced (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, staining and image overlay of cells induced to express either VSV-G-MAS-YFP or VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP with Image-iT membrane dye confirmed effective plasma membrane delivery of VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP, but not VSV-G-MAS-YFP (Fig. 3D). Cell-surface biotinylation studies also confirmed cell-surface delivery of VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP, but not VSV-G-MAS-YFP (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4AT1 receptor glycosylation, biotinylation, and up-regulation studies. A, shown is the cell-surface biotinylation of Flp-InT-RExHEK293 cells harboring VSV-G-MAS-YFP or VSV-G-I138D MAS-YFP at the Flp-In locus. Cells were left untreated or were treated with doxycycline (Dox; 0.1 μg/ml) for 24 h to induce expression of the forms of MAS-YFP, and cell-surface receptors were biotinylated and pulled down with streptavidin-agarose beads. Total lysates (l) and precipitated samples (b) were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-VSV-G antibody. B, membranes of cells induced to coexpress VSV-G-MAS-YFP and c-Myc-AT1R-CFP were treated with or without peptide N-glycosidase F (NGaseF), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc antibody to identify forms of c-Myc-AT1R-CFP.

Lysates of these cells as well as from cells expressing only VSV-G-MAS-YFP in an inducible fashion were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-c-Myc antibody.

Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, tags ENaC with ubiquitin for internalization and degradation, but when it is phosphorylated by the aldosterone-induced kinase, SGK1, Nedd4-2 is inhibited and apical ENaC density and sodium absorption increase. We evaluated the hypothesis that 14-3-3 proteins participate in the aldosterone-mediated regulation of ENaC by associating with phosphorylated Nedd4-2. Mouse cortical collecting duct (mCCD) epithelia cultured on filters expressed several 14-3-3 isoforms; this study focused on an isoform whose expression was induced 3-fold by aldosterone, 14-3-3β. In polarized mCCD epithelia, aldosterone elicited significant, time-dependent increases in the expression of α-ENaC, SGK1, phospho-Nedd4-2, and 14-3-3β without altering total Nedd4-2. Aldosterone decreased the interaction of α-ENaC with Nedd4-2, and with similar kinetics increased the association of 14-3-3β with phospho-Nedd4-2. Short interfering RNA-induced knockdown of 14-3-3β blunted the aldosterone-induced increase in α-ENaC expression, returned α-ENaC-Nedd4-2 binding toward prealdosterone levels, and blocked the aldosterone-stimulated increase in transepithelial sodium transport. Incubation of cell extracts with a selective phospho-Nedd4-2 antibody blocked the aldosterone-induced association of 14-3-3β with Nedd4-2, implicating SGK1 phosphorylation at Ser-328 as the primary site of 14-3-3β binding. Our studies show that aldosterone increases the expression of 14-3-3β, which interacts with phospho-Nedd4-2 to block its interaction with ENaC, thus enhancing sodium absorption by increasing apical membrane ENaC density.

The first step in sodium transport across epithelial cells lining the distal nephron is facilitated by the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; CCD, cortical collecting duct; Nedd4-2, neural precursor cells expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4 isoform 2; SGK1, serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; siRNA, short interfering RNA; mCCD, murine CCD; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; IP, immunoprecipitation.2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; CCD, cortical collecting duct; Nedd4-2, neural precursor cells expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4 isoform 2; SGK1, serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1; siRNA, short interfering RNA; mCCD, murine CCD; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; IP, immunoprecipitation. a constituent of the apical (lumen-facing) membrane. These channels are identified by their sensitivity to the diuretic, amiloride, by their high selectivity to sodium over potassium, and by their single channel conductance of ∼5 picosiemens (1Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Schild L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cloning of ENaC identified its three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ (3Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 4Canessa C.M.

Barbry P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and has facilitated studies of sodium transport regulation. The physiological importance of ENaC is illustrated by human genetic diseases in which dysfunction of the channel results in clinical defects in salt and water balance (2Schild L. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Mutations in the genes encoding the α-, β-, or γ-subunits occur in families with pseudohypoaldosteronism, type 1, characterized by a loss of ENaC function (6Bonny O. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2399-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), or with genetic hypertension, which results from a gain in ENaC function (7Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). Liddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of hypertension that is sensitive to amiloride, reflecting a chronic elevation of ENaC activity. Acute and chronic regulation of ENaC contribute to salt and water homeostasis by controlling the rate of sodium absorption across renal collecting duct epithelia where ENaC constitutes the rate-determining step in sodium absorption (8Reif M.C. Troutman S.L. Schafer J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1986; 77: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Chronic regulation of ENaC in response to reduced extracellular fluid volume is mediated by aldosterone, the primary mineralocorticoid of vertebrates. A lag of approximately 1 h precedes the response to aldosterone, and this involves binding of the hormone to mineralocorticoid receptors in the cytosol and their translocation to the nucleus. The resulting induction of gene transcription alters the levels of transport and regulatory and metabolic proteins to elicit a concerted increase in distal nephron sodium absorption (9Stokes J.B. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 2318-2333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 10Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F559-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). During sodium repletion (low aldosterone), the β- and γ-subunits of ENaC are present in distal nephron principal cells, but the low expression of α-ENaC is limiting for channel function because the α-ENaC subunit is essential for the assembly of functional sodium channels that can traffic to the apical surface (11Loffing J. Zecevic M. Feraille E. Kaissling B. Asher C. Rossier B.C. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F675-F682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of α-ENaC transcription by aldosterone permits assembly of the heterotrimeric channel in the endoplasmic reticulum and its trafficking to the apical membrane, providing an important control point for enhancing sodium absorption. Once ENaC is delivered to the apical surface, its residency and turnover kinetics are governed by endocytic processes and associated protein interactions that involve recognition of PY motifs within the ENaC subunit C termini. These motifs constitute binding sites for the tryptophan-rich WW domains of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2. ENaC binding and ubiquitination by Nedd4-2 cause the channel to engage with the endocytic machinery (12Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Thomas B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). By promoting channel internalization and degradation, these protein interactions reduce apical ENaC surface density and maintain a low rate of sodium absorption during salt repletion. Accordingly, genetic mutation of the PY motifs in ENaC, or their elimination by premature stop codons, obviates the interaction of the channel with Nedd4-2, accounting for the increase in apical membrane ENaC density observed in patients with Liddle hypertension (14Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of aldosterone on sodium absorption is mediated primarily by increases in the number of active sodium entry channels in the apical membranes of collecting duct cells (1Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Alvarez de la Rosa D. Li H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Alterations in ENaC-Nedd4-2 interactions contribute to increased apical ENaC density during aldosterone stimulation. This action of the steroid involves post-translational modifications in Nedd4-2 by the serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, SGK1, a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases whose expression is induced as part of the early response of cells to mineralocorticoids. After its induction by aldosterone, SGK1 phosphorylates residues corresponding to its consensus motif, RXRXX(S/T), and recent studies have demonstrated that Nedd4-2 contains three phosphorylation sites for the kinase (13Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.-D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by SGK1 interferes with its binding to ENaC, blocking channel endocytosis and increasing ENaC surface expression and sodium transport rate. Exactly how Nedd4-2 phosphorylation interferes with its ability to bind ENaC, however, has remained unclear. 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of highly conserved regulatory molecules that generally bind to phosphorylated residues (motifs) within their protein targets. In this way, they play important roles in a wide range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycling, protein biogenesis, and membrane trafficking (17Wilker E. Yaffe M.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 18Aitken A. Baxter H. Dubois T. Clokie S. Mackie S. Mitchell K. Peden A. Zemlickova E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There are seven mammalian isoforms of 14-3-3 (β, ϵ, γ, η, θ, σ, and ζ), each encoded by a distinct gene, and they may function as homo- or heterodimers (19Yaffe M.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Varied motifs have been associated with 14-3-3 binding, but two high affinity, phosphorylation-dependent motifs (RSXpSXP and RXXpSXP) were identified classically as 14-3-3 protein-binding sites (20Toker A. Ellis C.A. Sellers L.A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Freed E. Symons M. Macdonald S.G. McCormick F. Ruggieri R.

Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). These clearly resemble the SGK1 phosphorylation motifs on Nedd4-2 (see above); therefore, we sought to determine the role of 14-3-3 proteins in ENaC regulation. Since this project was initiated, two other groups have reached this conclusion, and their studies have implicated Nedd4-2 as a substrate for 14-3-3 protein binding in response to SGK1 phosphorylation (24Ichimura T. Yamamura H. Sasamoto K. Tominaga Y. Taoka M. Kakiuchi K. Shinkawa T. Takahashi N. Shimada S. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13187-13194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Bhalla V. Daidie D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Those studies, performed primarily in Xenopus oocytes and HEK cells, demonstrated interactions of the 14-3-3η and σ isoforms with Nedd4-2 and increases in ENaC activity when these isoforms were co-expressed (discussed further below). The present study focuses on the role of 14-3-3 proteins in the response of mCCD epithelia to aldosterone. We evaluated 14-3-3 isoform expression in polarized mCCD cells, determined the influence of aldosterone on 14-3-3 isoform expression, and evaluated the impact of an aldosterone-induced isoform, 14-3-3β, on the protein interactions involved in the stimulation of transepithelial sodium transport by the steroid hormone. Antibodies—Antibodies specific for 14-3-3 isoforms were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) as follows: β (A-15), γ (C-16), ϵ (T-16), θ (C-17), σ (N-14), η (K-12), and ζ (C-16). Santa Cruz Biotechnology indicates isoform specificity of their 14-3-3 antibodies, except for cross-reactivity of anti-14-3-3η with two other isoforms. However, no signal for this isoform was detected at either the RNA or protein level (see below). Anti-Nedd4-2 phosphopeptide antibody was generously provided by Dr. Oliver Staub, University of Lausanne, Switzerland; it was generated, affinity-purified, and characterized as described (26Flores S.Y. Loffing-Cueni D. Kamynina E. Daidie D. Gerbex C. Chabanel S. Dudler J. Loffing J. Staub O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Antibodies to SGK1 and Nedd4-2 were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). For α-ENaC, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against an epitope of the extracellular loop corresponding to the human amino acid sequence 138YRYPEIKEELEELDRITEQT. Cysteine was added at the N terminus for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin; the mouse sequence in this region differs by one amino acid. Secondary antibodies against mouse or rabbit were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies to β-actin and the HA epitope were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—mpkCCDc14 cells (provided by A. Vandewalle and M. Bens, INSERM, Paris, France) were grown in flasks (passage 30–40) in defined medium as described previously (27Vinciguerra M. Deschenes G. Hasler U. Mordasini D. Rousselot M. Doucet A. Vandewalle A. Martin P.Y. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2677-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The growth medium was composed of equal volumes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, plus 60 nm sodium selenate, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2 mm glutamine, 50 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 5 μg/ml insulin, 20 mm d-glucose, 2% v/v fetal calf serum, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (reagents from Invitrogen and Sigma). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, and the media were changed every 2nd day. For both biochemical and electrophysiological experiments, mCCD cells were subcultured onto permeable filter supports. Transepithelial currents were measured across Transwell filters (0.4-μm pore size, 0.33-cm2 surface area; Corning Costar). For the biochemical experiments, mCCD epithelia were polarized on 45-cm2 filters (Corning Costar) for ∼7 days prior to use. Development of a polarized monolayer was assessed by recordings of open circuit voltage (typically ∼50 mV) and transepithelial resistance (typically ∼2 kiloohms·cm2) using “chopstick” electrodes (Millipore). To ensure a regulatory base line, the growth medium bathing cells on filters was replaced with a minimal medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (without drugs or hormones) for at least 24 h prior to experiments. Thereafter, mCCD epithelia were either maintained without additives or treated with aldosterone (10 nm; Sigma) for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. This concentration of aldosterone activates mineralocorticoid but not glucocorticoid receptors in CCD cells (28Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Helms M.N. Stokes J.B. Fejes-Toth G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 217: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and it corresponds to plasma aldosterone levels that are reached during severe salt restriction (29Hou J. Speirs H.J. Seckl J.R. Brown R.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1190-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RNA Expression—Total RNA was extracted from polarized CCD cells and reverse-transcribed to single-stranded cDNA as described previously (30Liang X. Zhang H. Zhou A. Wang H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1443-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze gene expression in polarized mCCD epithelia. According to published protocols, cDNA was amplified using 20 pmol of specific primers for α-ENaC, SGK1 (31Velic A. Gabriels G. Hirsch J.R. Schroter R. Edemir B. Paasche S. Schlatter E. Am. J. Transplant. 2005; 5: 1276-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), 14-3-3 isoforms (32Qi W. Liu X. Qiao D. Martinez J.D. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), Nedd4-2, and β-actin (31Velic A. Gabriels G. Hirsch J.R. Schroter R. Edemir B. Paasche S. Schlatter E. Am. J.

Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the optimal number of PCR cycles that yielded products in the linear range of amplification. The abundance of each detected transcript was normalized to that of β-actin.TABLE 1PCR primer sequences and reaction parametersGenePrimer sequencesCycleTannealSize°Cbp14-3-3βSense5′-TTG AGG GTA CAG AGT GAC-3′3058840Antisense5′-CAT TCG GCT GTG GAT AGA GA-3′14-3-3γSense5′-CAG TGT CCT CCT CCT TCT CC-3′3058836Antisense5′-TAA AGA CTG CAG TAG TAG CAT-3′14-3-3ϵSense5′-AGT CGG AGA CAC TAT CCG CTT C-3′30581089Antisense5′-AGC CTC TAT GTA GTC CTG TTA G-3′14-3-3ηSense5′-CTA GCG AGC CAG CGG TGT GA-3′3058980Antisense5′-GCA ACC ATC AGT CCA GCA ATG CC-3′14-3-3σSense5′-AGA GAC ACA GAG TCC GGC ATT GG-3′30581012Antisense5′-TAG GTG CGC TCA ACA GCT GC-3′14-3-3θSense5′-CGT GAA GCT CTC GAG GCT CCT-3′3058858Antisense5′-TGA AGG AAA GAA GGA TGA CAC C-3′14-3-3ζSense5′-CGA TCA GTC ACA ACA AGC AT-3′3058571Antisense5′-GCC TGT GAG CAG CGA GAT CC-3′α-ENaCSense5′-CGT TTC TGT CCT CAC CCT AC-3′3060493Antisense5′-GAT GGC TGT TCT ATT TGT TCC TT-3′SGK1Sense5′-TCC CAA CCC TTG CGT ATT TCC C-3′3064350Antisense5′-TGC CCA TTT TGC AGG TGA CAT T-3′Nedd4-2Sense5′-TGA AGT GGA TCT TGG AAA ACG ACC C-3′3064344Antisense5′-GGC AGT AGC CGT TCT TGT AAA TGG A-3′β-ActinSense5′-ATG GAT GAC GAT ATC GCT GCG C-3′3064202Antisense5′-TCA GGG TCA GGA TGC CTC TCT T-3′β-ActinSense5′-GTG GGG CGC CCC AGG CAC CA-3′3058539Antisense5′-CTC CTT AAT GTC ACG CAC GAT TTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Co-immunoprecipitation and Antibody Competition Assays—Protein assays (BCA; Pierce) ensured that equivalent amounts of protein were used for Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Pre-cleared mCCD cell lysates (∼1 mg of protein) were mixed with the appropriate primary antibodies for 1.5 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (0.4% deoxycholate acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Twenty five μl of washed protein A- or G-Sepharose beads was added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer four times and precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 s. The immunocomplexes were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting (see below). For the phospho-Nedd4-2 competition assay, the phosphopeptide antibody was added to lysates from polarized mCCD cells for 2 h at 4 °C before mixing with precipitating antibodies; the co-IP was then performed as above. Controls for the immunoprecipitations were performed using a concentration of HA antibody equal to that of the primary precipitating antibody. Immunoblot Analyses—Equal amounts of protein from either aldosterone-treated or nontreated polarized mCCD cells or the immunoprecipitates described above were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Unbound sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20). The blots were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-14-3-3 isoform, each 1:1000; anti-phospho-Nedd4-2, 1:500; anti-Nedd4-2, 1:1000; anti-SGK1, 1:1000; anti-α-ENaC, 1:1000; or anti-β-actin, 1:3000) at room temperature for 2 h. The blots were then washed three times for 10 min each with TBST and incubated for 1 h with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Amersham Biosciences) in TBST with 5% milk, followed by three TBST washes. The reactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). β-Actin expression provided an internal control. mCCD Transfection with siRNA—Control siRNA and siRNA for 14-3-3β were obtained from Dharmacon Inc. (Chicago) as SMART-pool® reagents. This contains four SMARTselection designed siRNAs targeting four regions of the same mRNA without targeting related gene family members (see Fig. 5 for verification). In vitro transfections with 14-3-3 or control siRNAs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, mCCD cells were seeded on filters and were transfected with siRNAs when they were ∼80% confluent. A total of 100 pmol of siRNA was used for 5 × 105 cells in 2 ml of culture medium. The filters were washed 24 h after transfection and then maintained under control conditions or treated with aldosterone (10 nm) for 48 h. Thus, 3 days elapsed between siRNA transfection and the biochemical or functional assays to evaluate the influence of 14-3-3 knockdown on protein expression, protein interactions, or sodium transport. In addition to the siRNA control, the results were compared with data obtained from untreated CCD cells. Short Circuit Current Recordings—Epithelia cultured on filter supports were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Costar), and the cultures were continuously short circuited by an automatic voltage clamp (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa City) as described previously (33Butterworth M.B. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. Frizzell R.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 125: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The bathing solution consisted of (in mm) the following: 120 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 3.3 KH2PO4, 0.8 K2HPO4, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 CaCl2, and 10 d-glucose. Chambers were maintained at 37 °C and gassed continuously with a mixture of 95% O2, 5% CO2, which fixed the pH at 7.4. Amiloride (10 μm) was added to the apical bath to determine ENaC-mediated transepithelial currents. Statistical Analysis—Data were obtained from experiments performed 3–4 times, and values are presented as mean ± S.E. p values were calculated by analysis of variance followed by unpaired t test as appropriate. A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Aldosterone Regulates the Expression of 14-3-3 Isoforms—The expression of 14-3-3 isoforms in mCCD cells was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. cDNA generated from polarized mCCD epithelia under basal, nonstimulated conditions was used with isoform-specific primers (Table 1) to perform semi-quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A). Products of appropriate size and sequence corresponded to the 14-3-3 isoforms β, γ, ϵ, θ, and σ; 14-3-3η and -ζ were not detected. In other experiments, cell lysates were obtained from both control and aldosterone-treated mCCD monolayers; the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for 14-3-3 proteins using the seven isoform-specific antibodies described above. The results obtained under basal conditions, shown in Fig. 1B, agree qualitatively with the evaluation of isoform expression at the RNA level. Isoforms β, γ, and σ were most abundantly expressed in mCCD epithelia under basal conditions; relatively weak expression of the ϵ and θ isoforms was observed. As in the PCR study, the 14-3-3η and -ζ isoforms were not detected at the protein level using the available antibodies (not shown). The aldosterone sensitivity of 14-3-3 protein expression was determined in mCCD epithelia treated with 10 nm aldosterone for 24 h (Fig. 1B). This treatment increased the expression of the 14-3-3β and -ϵ isoforms by 2.8- and 8.2-fold, respectively. The β isoform predominated in the presence of aldosterone even though the fold increase in 14-3-3ϵ was greater. This is the first demonstration of steroid sensitivity of 14-3-3 protein expression, and it implies that these isoforms may play an important role in the functional response of CCD epithelia to aldosterone. Significant changes were not observed in the expression of 14-3-3γ, -θ, or -σ, and as under basal conditions, 14-3-3η and -ζ were not detected following treatment with aldosterone. These data indicate selectivity of the steroid response, and they imply that there is specificity among the expressed isoforms regarding their binding partners in mCCD epithelia. 14-3-3 Proteins Interact Directly with Nedd4-2 in Vivo—As discussed above, prior studies have suggested that 14-3-3η and -σ interact physically with Nedd4-2 in heterologous expression systems (24Ichimura T. Yamamura H. Sasamoto K. Tominaga Y. Taoka M. Kakiuchi K. Shinkawa T. Takahashi N. Shimada S. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13187-13194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Bhalla V. Daidie D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 3073-3084Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction of the five expressed 14-3-3 isoforms with Nedd4-2 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed using lysates from polarized mCCD epithelia. Protein complexes were isolated from epithelia maintained under basal or aldosterone-treated conditions using anti-Nedd4-2, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with isoform-selective 14-3-3 antibodies. Representative data are illustrated in Fig. 2. IPs performed with an anti-HA IgG as a control yielded no 14-3-3 signal. Under basal conditions, Nedd4-2 interacted primarily with the 14-3-3β and -σ isoforms. Much weaker interactions were observed between Nedd4-2 and 14-3-3γ, -ϵ, and -θ isoforms (the latter two under longer exposure), but 14-3-3ϵ was expressed at lower levels under these conditions (see Fig. 1). Relative to its basal expression level, the 14-3-3γ interaction was particularly weak, suggesting isoform selectivity for Nedd4-2 binding. Nedd4-2 binding to 14-3-3β and 14-3-3ϵ was markedly increased by aldosterone, the latter reflecting largely the 8-fold induction of its expression by the steroid (Fig. 1B). The interaction of Nedd4-2 with 14-3-3σ was not affected by aldosterone treatment. Presumably, the interactions detected in the absence of aldosterone represent binding to phosphorylated Nedd4-2. Previous studies have detected tonic activity of SGK1 in mCCD cells (34Boyd C. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F505-F512Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 35Zhou R. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4518-4523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, we detected a small amount of phosphorylated Nedd4-2 in the absence of aldosterone treatment (Fig. 3). This basal level of interaction may also result from lingering effects of dexamethasone, which is present in the mCCD cell growth media and removed 1 day prior to study. The identification of 14-3-3β as an aldosterone-induced protein, and its predominant association with Nedd4-2 during stimulation, prompted us to examine the functional significance of this interaction and its influence on ENaC-mediated sodium transport during the aldosterone response. Pattern of ENaC Regulatory Protein Expression during the Action of Aldosterone—We used RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses to examine the expression of α-ENaC, SGK1, Nedd4-2, and 14-3-3β as a function of time during the stimulation of mCCD epithelia by 10 nm ald"
https://openalex.org/W1983918041,"The homotrimeric copper-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) contains one type-1 and one type-2 copper center per monomer. Electrons enter through the type-1 site and are shuttled to the type-2 site where nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide. To investigate the catalytic mechanism of NiR the effects of pH and nitrite on the turnover rate in the presence of three different electron donors at saturating concentrations were measured. The activity of NiR was also measured electrochemically by exploiting direct electron transfer to the enzyme immobilized on a graphite rotating disk electrode. In all cases, the steady-state kinetics fitted excellently to a random-sequential mechanism in which electron transfer from the type-1 to the type-2 site is rate-limiting. At low [NO–2] reduction of the type-2 site precedes nitrite binding, at high [NO–2] the reverse occurs. Below pH 6.5, the catalytic activity diminished at higher nitrite concentrations, in agreement with electron transfer being slower to the nitrite-bound type-2 site than to the water-bound type-2 site. Above pH 6.5, substrate activation is observed, in agreement with electron transfer to the nitrite-bound type-2 site being faster than electron transfer to the hydroxyl-bound type-2 site. To study the effect of slower electron transfer between the type-1 and type-2 site, NiR M150T was used. It has a type-1 site with a 125-mV higher midpoint potential and a 0.3-eV higher reorganization energy leading to an ∼50-fold slower intramolecular electron transfer to the type-2 site. The results confirm that NiR employs a random-sequential mechanism. The homotrimeric copper-containing nitrite reductase (NiR) contains one type-1 and one type-2 copper center per monomer.

The type-2 copper is coordinated by three histidines and forms the active site together with a water network, an aspartate, and a histidine.

Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar) is whether nitrite binds to the oxidized type-2 copper first after which the electron is transferred to the type-2 site (5Adman E.T.

Among key observations indicating that nitrite binds first to the oxidized copper are that the reduced type-2 site in NiR prefers a low occupancy of the fourth coordination position (14Murphy M.E.

Howes B.D. Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) than its Michaelis constant (Km).Here we report on investigations of the catalytic mechanism of NiR by kinetic techniques for which solutions of NiR with three different electron donors at saturating concentrations have been employed. The experiments have been complemented by electrochemical experiments on NiR that was immobilized on a rotating disk graphite electrode. It appears that the results can be analyzed and fitted satisfactorily on the basis of a random sequential mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterial—Wild-type NiR (from Alcaligenes faecalis S-6) and NiR M150T were prepared as described (20Wijma H.J. Canters G.W. de Vries S. Verbeet M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10467-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 4H. J. Wijma, I. MacPherson, M. Alexandre, R. E. M. Diederix, G. W. Canters, M. E. P. Murphy, and M. P. Verbeet, submitted for publication. The copper content of native NiR and NiR M150T used for electrode experiments was 1.7 copper/monomer, as determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (32Brenner A.J. Harris E.D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). For assays in solution, native NiR with a copper content of 2.0 per monomer was used.Activity Assays in Solution—Unless reported otherwise, the buffer was 25 mm malate-MES-HEPES (MMH). The pH was adjusted with NaOH. Reported pH values are those of the assay buffer and were determined at the temperature of the assay. Nitrite reductase activity assays using saturating concentrations of reduced pseudoazurin (400 μm, which is well above Km) as the electron donor were carried out as described (20Wijma H.J. Canters G.W. de Vries S. Verbeet M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10467-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. The activity was measured by monitoring the increase of the absorption band at 590 nm, typical of oxidized pseudoazurin (ϵ590 nm = 2900 m–1 cm–1 (33Kakutani T. Watanabe H. Arima K. Beppu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar)). A linear increase of absorbance with time (providing real initial rates) was observed in all cases.Activity assays that employed benzyl viologen as the electron donor at saturating concentrations were carried out at 25 °C in a sealed cuvette that had been flushed with argon to make it anaerobic. The benzyl viologen (200 μm) was reduced by dithionite to an initial absorbance at 600 nm of 1.2–1.6. Alternatively, reduced benzyl viologen was prepared electrochemically with a platinum working electrode and an auxiliary electrode (34Stankovich M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity was calculated from the rate of decrease in absorbance of reduced benzyl viologen (ϵ603 nm = 14,500 m–1 cm–1 (35van Leeuwen J.W. van Dijk C. Veeger C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 135: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) after addition of NiR, corrected for baseline drift. The decrease in absorbance was linear with respect to time after addition of NiR and remained so until >95% of the reduced viologen had been oxidized.The activity with benzyl viologen as an electron donor was higher than the activity determined from the rate of reduction of nitrite (results not shown). This discrepancy arises because the nitric oxide product is reduced further, non-enzymatically, by the viologen to give nitrous oxide or ammonia (1Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar). Because the stoichiometry between nitrite conversion and viologen consumption depended on the precise reaction conditions and varied from case to case (not further investigated) the catalytic activity is reported in arbitrary units when benzyl viologen was used as a reductant (see for instance Figs. 1C and 3B, a.u.). In some assays methyl viologen was used instead of benzyl viologen. The activities with a viologen as the electron donor, as quantified by nitrite disappearance, are similar to the activities with pseudoazurin as the electron donor (for A. faecalis S-6 NiR at pH 7 the kcat of nitrite reduction is 338 s–1 with methyl viologen (36Wijma H.J. Boulanger M.J. Molon A. Fittipaldi M. Huber M. Murphy M.E. Verbeet M.P. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4075-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and 392 s–1 with pseudoazurin (20Wijma H.J. Canters G.W. de Vries S. Verbeet M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10467-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as the electron donor).FIGURE 3Deviations from Henri-Michaelis-Menten kinetics at high pH.

Closed and open circles represent the different batches that are fitted to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3) by a continuous and a broken line, respectively.

During the experiments, the cell was kept anaerobic by flushing the head space with argon. The pyrolytic graphite edge electrode, constructed in the laboratory, had a surface area of 4 mm2. Pyrolytic graphite (GE Advanced Ceramics) was embedded in epoxy (Araldite CY1300:HY1300 mixed 3:1 w/w from Ciba/Robnor) so that the basal plane was perpendicular with respect to the surface that contacts the solution. For NiR immobilization, the pyrolytic graphite edge electrode was polished thoroughly using a polishing cloth (Buehler) covered with 6 micron diamond, sonicated in H2O, washed with buffer, then exposed to NiR (>100 μm) for ∼30 s, rinsed with H2O, and inserted in the buffer. After sealing the cell, the electrode was cycled between 560 and –140 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to check that oxygen was absent. Observed currents were corrected for background currents measured in the absence of nitrite.Experiments were initiated by holding the electrode at a potential of 560 mV versus NHE for 10 s, followed by a “jump” to the desired value. After the background current had stabilized, the dependence of activity on nitrite concentration was measured by stepwise increases in nitrite concentration. The current at each nitrite concentration was averaged over 10 s, and the current in the absence of nitrite was subtracted. The temperature was kept at 0 °C to improve the stability of the protein film on the electrode; from control experiments it was established that the loss of active coverage during the time of the experiment was <10%.For reliable determination of enzymatic constants by PFV, the electrode rotation rate should be sufficiently fast to prevent transport of substrate to the electrode (or accumulation of product near the electrode) becoming rate-limiting (37Heering H.A. Hirst J. Armstrong F.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 6889-6902Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Varying the rate of rotation between 500 and 9000 rpm did not influence the catalytic current, not even at the lowest nitrite concentrations. Thus, the catalytically active coverage of NiR on the electrodes is sufficiently low to maintain steady-state levels of substrate close to the surface of the electrode during turnover. Also the low currents observed (∼300 nA) were consistent with a low catalytically active coverage. The coverage was estimated by assuming that the turnover rate/active site (kt) is the same as measured in solution and is linearly related to the catalytic current (it) by Equation 1, it =–FAΓ kt (Equation 1), in which A is the surface area of the electrode, Γ is the enzymatic coverage (catalytically active subunits/unit of surface), F is the Faraday constant, and a negative sign signifies a reduction reaction. By combining the data from Figs. 1 and 4 the enzymatic coverage was estimated from Equation 1 to be 0.03 pmol cm–2. As a comparison, for fumarate reductase (38Léger C. Heffron K. Pershad H.R. Maklashina E. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Ackrell B.A. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11234-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) no transport limitation is observed at the much higher coverage of 13 pmol cm–2. Also for hydrogenase (39Jones A.K. Lamle S.E. Pershad H.R. Vincent K.A. Albracht S.P.J. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 8505-8514Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), a far more active enzyme, no substrate depletion is observed provided the coverage is below 1 pmol cm–2. These observations justify the assumption that in our case no complications because of transport limitations affect the observations. The typical rotation speed during the experiments was 2000 rpm. The data were fitted using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Inc.).FIGURE 4Kinetic constants of electrode-immobilized NiR versus pH. Open circles denote the kinetic constants of wt NiR determined on a pyrolytic graphite edge electrode held at –70 mV versus NHE, closed circles denote those determined at +110 mV versus NHE, and gray-filled squares denote the data points of NiR M150T determined at –70 mV versus NHE (no data points are shown in B because icatB was difficult to determine because of the low amplitude). The thin line in D is a linear fit of log KmB versus pH of the data points at +110 mV, the dashed line is a fit to the data points at –70 mV for wt, and the thick line is a fit to the data points of M150T. In B and D no data points are shown above pH 7 because above this pH no saturation is observed and thus no data could be obtained.

Depicted are the type-2 site and the various changes it may undergo during turnover. In the starting configuration the oxidized Cu(II) carries water as the fourth ligand. Replacement of the water (step 1, k1 and k–1) by nitrite and subsequent electron transfer from the type-1 site to the type-2 site (step 3, k3 and k–3) leads to the reduced nitrite-bound type-2 site. These two steps constitute the B route. The A route consists of step 2 (electron transfer from type-1 to type-2) and the subsequent step 4 (nitrite binding) and leads to the same nitrite-bound reduced type-2 site, which is subsequently returned to the initial state (step 6) by conversion of nitrite to NO, dissociation of the NO, and binding of a water molecule. Conversion of the H2O-bound reduced type-2 site to an inactive three-coordinate (14Murphy M.E. Turley S. Adman E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28455-28460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 22Strange R.W. Murphy L.M. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H. Eady R.R. Smith B.E. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reduced form (step 5) is included in the scheme. The effect of this step (or equilibrium) on the reaction kinetics can be observed with freshly prepared enzyme in the initial phase of the reaction. 5H. J. Wijma, L. J. C. Jeuken, M. P. Verbeet, F. A. Armstrong, and G. W. Canters, unpublished results. Scheme 1 applies at low pH; at high pH the same scheme applies but with the water replaced by OH–. This also means that the kinetic constants in Scheme 1 are pH-dependent. In a random sequential mechanism as in Scheme 1, at low nitrite concentration electron transfer to the type-2 site will be faster than nitrite binding, and catalysis will mainly occur via the A route (step 2 and 4). At higher nitrite concentration, the nitrite binding will become faster than the electron transfer to the H2O/OH–-bound type-2 site, and catalysis will follow the B route (via steps 1 and 3).SCHEME 1Proposed catalytic mechanism of NiR. The catalytic and product release step k6 is in fact reversible (20Wijma H.J. Canters G.W. de Vries S. Verbeet M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10467-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which is not modeled because in the current experiments the build-up of the product nitric oxide is prevented. The nitrite is depicted as deprotonated but it may also be protonated in the catalytic cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)When Scheme 1 applies the dependence of kt on the nitrite concentration ([S]) can be shown to obey Equation 2 (see supplemental materials for derivation and details), kt(S)=(kcatA[S]+kcatB[S]2/KmB)/(KmA+[S]+[S]2/KmB) (Equation 2). Equation 2 also applies when the isomerization (step 5) is omitted from Scheme 1. The terms kcatA and KmA, and kcatB and KmB are primarily associated with the A and B routes, respectively. Thus, the Michaelis constants KmA and KmB are a measure of Kdred(k−1/k1) and Kdox(k−4/k4), respectively. Michaelis constants approximate to dissociation constants when (a) the catalytic step is much faster than the electron-transfer steps, (b) the isomerization (step 5) is slow, and (c) the dissociation of nitrite is faster than the other steps (see Table S1 in supplemental material). Furthermore, when step 6 is not rate-limiting we find that (Table S1 in supplemental material) the ratio of kcatB/kcatA approximately equals the ratio of the electron transfer rates k3 and k2. In the case that NiR follows an ordered mechanism (only steps 2, 4, and 6 or only steps 1, 3, 5, and 6) standard Henri-Michaelis-Menten (HMM) behavior should be observed, as given by kt(S) = kcat[S]/(Km + [S]) (Equation 3).RESULTSDeviations from Henri-Michaelis-Menten Kinetics by NiR—The investigations were started by measuring the catalytic activity (kt) of nitrite reductase as a function of pH with pseudoazurin as the electron donor at saturating concentrations. With 500 μm nitrite maximum activity was observed around pH 5.6, whereas at 5 mm nitrite maximum activity occurred at pH 6.0 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the maximum activity was 25% higher with 500 μm nitrite than with 5 mm nitrite. To investigate this phenomenon further, we assayed the activity as a function of nitrite concentration. At pH 4.9, the activity with increasing nitrite concentration reached a maximum followed by a steady decrease at higher nitrite concentrations (Fig. 1B) that could be fitted to Equation 2 resulting in kcatB/kcatA<0.4.To investigate the possible dependence of these kinetics on the nature of the electron donor, we used benzyl viologen instead of pseudoazurin, again at saturating concentrations. Benzyl viologen is a far stronger reductant (EM =–350 mV versus NHE) than pseudoazurin (EM = 295 mV at pH 6 (20Wijma H.J. Canters G.W. de Vries S. Verbeet M.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10467-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)). Furthermore, benzyl viologen is expected to reduce NiR via a nonspecific collisional mechanism, whereas pseudoazurin forms a specific complex with NiR (40Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Ohnuki T. Turley S. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 41Kukimoto M. Nishiyama M. Tanokura M. Adman E.T. Horinouchi S. J. Biol.

Soc. 2004; 126: 5658-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), so we might also ascertain the role of complex formation in the overall mechanism. Our results showed that with benzyl viologen as the electron donor, the catalytic rate also diminished at higher nitrite concentrations (Fig. 1C).Finally, in a separate experiment the catalytic activity of NiR immobilized on a rotating disk electrode was measured by observing the reductive current (Fig. 2A). The activity displayed the same dependence on nitrite concentration (Fig. 2B) as observed before in the bulk experiments, both at electrode potentials of –70 and +110 mV versus NHE. The latter observation shows that the measured activities do not depend on the kinetics of the electron transfer between electrode and type-1 site. If the experiment was started at high nitrite concentration, and the solution was diluted, an increase in catalytic current was observed (results not shown). In addition, the M150T mutant of NiR (in which intramolecular electron transfer from type-1 to type-2 is retarded), also displayed a decrease in icat at higher nitrite concentrations (Fig. S1 of supplemental materials). Thus, it was established that regardless of the nature of the electron donor the catalytic activity of NiR is optimized at a particular nitrite concentration and drops when this level is exceeded.FIGURE 2Kinetic constants measured by protein film voltammetry. A, reductive current versus time upon subsequent nitrite additions. After the electrode was held at –70 mV versus NHE for 200 s, the background current was stable, and the nitrite concentration was increased stepwise.

NF-κB is restricted to the cytoplasm by inhibitory proteins that are degraded when specifically phosphorylated, permitting NF-κB to enter the nucleus and activate target genes. Phosphorylation of the inhibitory proteins is mediated by an IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which can be composed of two subunits with enzymatic activity, IKKα and IKKβ. The preferred substrate for IKKβ is IκBα, degradation of which liberates p65 (RelA) to enter the nucleus where it induces genes important to innate immunity. IKKα activates a non-canonical NF-κB pathway in which p100 (NF-κB2) is processed to p52. Once produced, p52 can enter the nucleus and induce genes important to adaptive immunity. This study shows that Akt binds to and increases the activity of IKKα and thereby increases p52 production in cells. Constitutively active Akt augments non-canonical NF-κB activity, whereas kinase dead Akt or inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase have the opposite effect. Basal and ligand-induced p52 production is reduced in mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in Akt1 and Akt2 compared with parental cells. These observations show that Akt plays a role in activation of basal and induced non-canonical NF-κB activity. NF-κB is a family of transcription factors important for innate and adaptive immunity.

In unstimulated cells, binary complexes of subunits are restricted to the cytoplasm by interaction with inhibitors of κB, IκB proteins. Cytokines, or UV radiation, promote the phosphorylation and degradation of the IκB proteins, permitting NF-κB to move into the nucleus and alter gene expression.

Homozygous deletion of IKKβ diminishes cytokine-induced NF-κB activation and results in embryonic lethality in mice due to apoptosis of the liver (6Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T.

IKKβ plays a predominant role in TNF- and interleukin-1-induced phosphorylation of IκB, whereas IKKα is largely dispensable for this process. The IKKβ-mediated pathway that leads to IκB degradation and translocation of RelA/p50 heterodimers into the nucleus is the canonical pathway that plays an essential role in innate immunity (1Verma I.M.

Production of p52 is important to immunity and the development and progression of cancer. In mice, overexpression of p52 in the absence of p100 leads to lymphocyte hyperplasia and transformation (27Ishikawa H. Carrasco D. Claudio E. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. J. Exp.

Here we demonstrate that Akt promotes processing of p100 to p52 and therefore regulates non-canonical NF-κB activity. Reagents—Recombinant human TNF was from Genentech Inc. Antibodies to IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ, p52, and RelB were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-Akt and anti-Akt were from Cell Signaling, Inc., anti-RelA from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-p50 from Geneka Biotechnology. An agonist, monoclonal antibody to the murine LTβR was from Apotech Inc. Cell Culture—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Spontaneously immortalized wild-type MEFs and Akt1–/–, Akt2–/–MEFs were a gift from Dr. Morris Birnbaum. Transfections, Immunoprecipitations, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate procedure and MEFs with Fugene-6. After transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations were conducted by modification of our previously described procedure (41Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After lysates were centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4 °C) for 5 min, equal amounts of supernatant protein were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P. For immunoprecipitations, 1 μg of specified antibody was absorbed to Protein A/G Plus-agarose. Lysate was added to the antibody/bead conjugates, which were shaken for 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P. For in vitro kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with kinase assay buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm NaF, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitates in 15 μl of kinase assay buffer were incubated with 0.25 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-IκBα-(1–51) at 30 °C for 30 min before the reaction was stopped. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Fractions—MEFs were scraped into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged, and the supernatant was aspirated. The cells were washed with ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.8 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in buffer A, which contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40 during a 5-min incubation on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 4,500 rpm for 3 min, and cytosolic supernatants were retained. Pellets were washed twice with buffer A, which contained 1.7 m sucrose, being centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min after each wash. The nuclear fraction was isolated by incubating the pellet for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the protease inhibitors in buffer A. Gene Reporter Assays—MEFs were transiently co-transfected with 5xNF-κB reporter and Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were incubated with 1 nm TNF or vehicle for 6 h, and luciferase activity was divided by β-galactosidase activity to normalize for variances in transfection efficiencies. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from MEFs using TRIzol. 1 μg of RNA was assayed using Superscript One-Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Primer pairs for mouse cIAP-2 are sense, 5′-CGGGAAATTGACCCTGCG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GTGCGCACTGTGCCCTTG-3′. The expected size for mouse cIAP2 is 259 bp. The primer pairs for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are sense, 5′-GAGGACCAGGTTGTCTCC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CCTTGGAGGCCATGTAGG-3′. This yields a product of 232 bp. RT-PCR products were fractionated on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Confocal Microscopy—MEFs were treated with vehicle or LY294002 for 8 h, fixed, permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with phosphate-buffered saline/2% bovine serum albumin, probed with anti-RelB, and then incubated with a Texas red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody. Syto 16 stain detected the cell nucleus. Excitation was performed using a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 krypton/argon laser confocal imaging system, and cells were visualized at 60× magnification. To assay the fraction of nuclear RelB, the fluorescence intensity of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was analyzed using ImageJ 1.33u software (National Institutes of Health). The nucleus of each cell in a field was highlighted, and its density was measured. Then the cytoplasm of each cell was highlighted, and its density was likewise determined. This was repeated for each cell in two fields for each experimental condition described in the Fig. legends. The graphical representation of the data is shown as a bar graph and depicts the average ratios of the nuclear to cytoplasmic mean fluorescence intensities (MFI (N)/MFI (C)) of all the cells in two fields for each condition tested. Akt Induces p100 Processing to p52—To determine whether Akt activates non-canonical NF-κB, HEK 293 (Fig. 1, A and B) or HeLa (Fig. 1C) cells were transfected with CA-Akt or KD-Akt and p52 expression was assayed. CA-Akt, but not KD-Akt, increased p52 production. Evaluation of the effect of CA-Akt in replicate experiments showed this to be significant in 293 cells (Fig. 1B). Increased expression of p52 in HeLa cells was comparable to that in 293 cells (Fig. 1C). Activated IKKα phosphorylates p100, initiating its degradation to p52, leading us to test whether Akt activates IKKα. An in vitro kinase assay revealed that Akt increases IKKα activity (Fig. 2, A and B). We also tested whether Akt and IKKα associate by immunoprecipitating IKKγ, which binds IKKα and IKKβ, from lysates of wild type (WT) MEFs or MEFs deficient in Ikkα or Ikkβ. Immunoblots show that WT MEFs contain a low level of IKKα relative to Ikkβ–/–MEFs and that Akt and IKKα co-immunoprecipitate from both cell types (Fig. 3). Akt was not immunoprecipitated from Ikkα–/–MEFs, showing that it does not complex IKKβ. These observations provide evidence that Akt complexes and activates IKKα and induces processing of p100 to p52.FIGURE 3IKKα and Akt complex.

Activation of canonical NF-κB is initiated by degradation of IκBα, whereas non-canonical NF-κB activity results from processing of p100 to p52. TNF induced degradation of IκBα in WT and Ikkα–/–but not in Ikkβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 4A), showing that IKKβ plays a predominant role in activation of canonical NF-κB. Spontaneously immortalized MEFs were used for these experiments, because responses of these cells were less variable than those of primary MEFs. 4Q. Li and I. Verma, unpublished observations. WT MEFs express a low level of p52, which is undetectable in Ikkα–/– cells but highly expressed in Ikkβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 4B) showing the necessity of IKKα for processing of p100 to p52. Because IKKα homodimers predominate in the IKKβ knock-out cells, p100 degradation to p52 is the predominant pathway activated, whereas in WT MEFs canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activity can be induced. p100 complexes RelB and restricts it to the cytoplasm, whereas p52 shuttles RelB into the nucleus. The basal activity of IKKα led us to test whether it could induce production of p52 and affect RelB localization in cells not stimulated with a cytokine or factor previously associated with activation of non-canonical NF-κB. RelB, or p100/52, was immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions of actively growing MEFs, in which Akt was active (data not shown). Western blots showed association of RelB and p100/p52 (Fig. 5). RelB was in the cytoplasm and nucleus of WT and Ikkβ–/– MEFs, whereas in Ikkα–/– MEFs, in which processing of p100 to p52 was not observed, RelB was cytoplasmic. Confocal microscopy shows significant nuclear RelB in Ikkβ–/– MEFs and less in WT or Ikkα–/– MEFs (Fig. 6A). The mean fluorescence intensity of stained RelB in two independent microscopic fields was also assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results presented in Fig. 6B show that more RelB is nuclear in IKKβ–/– cells than WT MEFs, which in turn contain more nuclear RelB than IKKα–/– cells. Thus, the greater fraction of nuclear RelB in Ikkβ–/– compared with WT MEFs correlates with elevated p52 in these cells. Also, in cells that express IKKα basal NF-κB2 activity promotes translocation of RelB into the nucleus.FIGURE 6RelB localization in MEFs determined by confocal microscopy. A, WT, Ikkα–/–, and Ikkβ–/– MEFs were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and probed with anti-RelB. Confocal microscopy analyzed RelB localization. B, a bar graph of the mean fluorescence intensity of RelB nuclear staining (N) is divided by the mean cytoplasmic intensity of RelB staining (C) for WT, IKKα–/–, and IKKβ–/– MEFs as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results are presented as the standard error of results from two microscopic fields.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TNF stimulates canonical but not non-canonical NF-κB as it activates IKKβ, which promotes IκBα degradation, but not NIK, which is essential for p100 processing to p52 (42Ramakrishnan P. Wang W. Wallach D. Immunity. 2004; 21: 477-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Gene reporter assays using serum-starved MEFs and a consensus reporter that assays canonical and non-canonical activity show that TNF increased NF-κB transactivation 3.5- and 2.2-fold in WT and Ikkα–/– cells, respectively, but did not increase NF-κB activity in Ikkβ–/– cells (Fig. 7A, left). The -fold stimulation of NF-κB gene reporter activity in WT MEFs reported here is comparable to that found by Sizemore et al. (43Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) using the same cell type. By determining NF-κB activity without comparison to control (Fig. 7A, right) one finds that TNF activated NF-κBinWTand Ikkα–/– cells; however, basal activity was 10-fold greater in WT than in Ikkα–/– cells. TNF did not stimulate NF-κB in Ikkβ–/– cells, but basal transactivation in Ikkβ–/– cells was 3 times greater than in WT and 200 times greater than in Ikkα–/– cells. To validate the gene reporter assays we assayed expression of the mRNA for an NF-κB target gene, cIAP2, in control- and TNF-stimulated MEFs by RT-PCR (Fig. 7B). TNF induced c-IAP2 mRNA in WT and Ikkα–/–, but not in Ikkβ–/–, MEFs. The basal level of c-IAP2 mRNA in Ikkβ–/– cells was higher than in WT cells and much higher than in Ikkα–/– cells. As these latter cells were deficient in IKKβ, expression of c-IAP2 mRNA must have resulted from activation of non-canonical NF-κB by IKKα. Thus, p100 processing to p52 and gene induction associated with non-canonical NF-κB is observed due to basal IKKα activity in growing cells. Because p52/RelB binds DNA and activates genes, we postulated that by increasing p52, Akt would augment NF-κB transactivation. To test the effect of p52 on NF-κB, we assayed transactivation in WT and Ikkα–/– MEFs transfected with p52 or empty vector. p52 elevated NF-κB transactivation. These results show that factors that activate IKKα and induce p52 diminish the response to TNF (Fig. 7C). This suggests that NF-κB activity in WT MEFs is a composite of the canonical and non-canonical pathways. A unique site in the promoters of some genes specifically binds p52/RelB (44Bonizzi G. Bebien M. Otero D.C. Johnson-Vroom K.E. Cao Y. Vu D. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. Ghosh G. Rickert R.C. Karin M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Other sites are activated rapidly by p50/RelA and more slowly by p52/RelB (45Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 46Saccani S.

This results from dimer exchange at promoter binding sites, and permits intersection of adaptive and innate immunity (44Bonizzi G. Bebien M. Otero D.C. Johnson-Vroom K.E. Cao Y. Vu D. Jegga A.G. Aronow B.J. Ghosh G. Rickert R.C. Karin M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 45Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1563-1574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), which require activation of distinct and common genes in a temporally correct manner. That p52 expression diminishes the effect of TNF on a consensus NF-κB promoter probably results from competition for binding and supports the view that signaling important to innate and/or adaptive immunity may induce distinct and common genes. PI 3-Kinase/Akt Signaling Affects Non-canonical NF-κB Activity in IKKα Knock-out Cells—TNF and lymphotoxin β activate Akt in WT, Ikkα–/–, and Ikkβ–/– MEFs (data not shown), permitting us to test for a role for PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling in production of p52. In MEFs treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, p52 production was diminished (Fig. 8A). Detection of residual p52 in cells with impaired PI 3-kinase activity likely resulted from failure of p52 present at the initiation of the experiment to turn over. This experiment supports a role for Akt and IKKα in establishing the basal level of cellular p52. The demonstration that Akt is important for p52 production led to the hypothesis that inhibition of PI 3-kinase function would impair nuclear localization of RelB and it did (Fig. 8B). Assay of the mean fluorescence intensity of RelB in IKKβ–/– MEFs and IKKβ–/– MEFs preincubated with LY294002 shows that inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity diminishes the amount of nuclear RelB (Fig. 8C). These results led us to test whether KD-Akt, which acts as a dominant-negative to block Akt action (36Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), would diminish NF-κB transactivation in WT or Ikkβ–/– MEFs, with a positive result (Fig. 8D). That this results from an effect of KD-Akt on NF-κB2 is supported by confocal microscopy showing that inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt in Ikkβ–/– MEFs restricts nuclear localization of RelB (Fig. 8B), which is mediated by its interaction with p52, and by the obligate role of IKKα in activation of non-canonical NF-κB (16Bonizzi G.

https://openalex.org/W2006062243,"Development and repair of the skeletal system and other organs is highly dependent on precise regulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), their receptors, and their intracellular signaling proteins known as Smads. The use of BMPs clinically to induce bone formation has been limited in part by the requirement of much higher doses of recombinant proteins in primates than were needed in cell culture or rodents. Therefore, control of cellular responsiveness to BMPs is now a critical area that is poorly understood. We determined that LMP-1, a LIM domain protein capable of inducing de novo bone formation, interacts with Smurf1 (Smad ubiquitin regulatory factor 1) and prevents ubiquitination of Smads. In the region of LMP responsible for bone formation, there is a motif that directly interacts with the Smurf1 WW2 domain and can effectively compete with Smad1 and Smad5 for binding. We have shown that small peptides containing this motif can mimic the ability to block Smurf1 from binding Smads. This novel interaction of LMP-1 with the WW2 domain of Smurf1 to block Smad binding results in increased cellular responsiveness to exogenous BMP and demonstrates a novel regulatory mechanism for the BMP signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2114816633,"Inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) counterbalancing protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) offers a strategy for augmenting PTK actions. Conservation of PTP catalytic sites limits development of specific PTP inhibitors. A number of receptor PTPs, including the leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) receptor and PTPmu, contain a wedge-shaped helix-loop-helix located near the first catalytic domain. Helix-loop-helix domains in other proteins demonstrate homophilic binding and inhibit function; therefore, we tested the hypothesis that LAR wedge domain peptides would exhibit homophilic binding, bind to LAR, and inhibit LAR function. Fluorescent beads coated with LAR or PTPmu wedge peptides demonstrated PTP-specific homophilic binding, and LAR wedge peptide-coated beads precipitated LAR protein. Administration of LAR wedge Tat peptide to PC12 cells resulted in increased proliferation, decreased cell death, increased neurite outgrowth, and augmented Trk PTK-mediated responses to nerve growth factor (NGF), a phenotype matching that found in PC12 cells with reduced LAR levels. PTPmu wedge Tat peptide had no effect on PC12 cells but blocked the PTPmu-dependent phenotype of neurite outgrowth of retinal ganglion neurons on a PTPmu substrate, whereas LAR wedge peptide had no effect. The survival- and neurite-promoting effect of the LAR wedge peptide was blocked by the Trk inhibitor K252a, and reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated LAR/TrkA association. The addition of LAR wedge peptide inhibited LAR co-immunoprecipitation with TrkA, augmented NGF-induced activation of TrkA, ERK, and AKT, and in the absence of exogenous NGF, induced activation of TrkA, ERK, and AKT. PTP wedge domain peptides provide a unique PTP inhibition strategy and offer a novel approach for augmenting PTK function."

Collagen VI is composed of three genetically distinct subunits, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), each of which contain a relatively short triple helix (∼335 amino acids), and N- and C-terminal globular regions. The α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains are similar in size and contain one N- and two C-terminal subdomains of around 200 amino acids that show homology to the type A domains of von Willebrand factor (12Chu M.L.

The α3(VI) chain is much larger than the other two, containing up to ten N-terminal A subdomains (N10-N1), and two C-terminal A subdomains (C1 and C2) (13Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R. Mayer U. Mann K. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of an α3(VI) N9-N2 fragment demonstrated that each A domain is an autonomous folding unit (14Specks U. Mayer U. Nischt R. Spissinger T. Mann K. Timpl R. Engel J. Chu M.-L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4281-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition, the α3(VI) chain has three C-terminal subdomains that are not found in α1(VI) or α2(VI). C3 is praline-rich and is similar to some salivary proteins, C4 shows homology to fibronectin type III repeats, and C5, the most C-terminal subdomain, has 40–50% identity to members of the Kunitz family of serine protease inhibitors (13Chu M.L.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The complex process of collagen VI assembly begins with intracellular association of α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains and folding of the triple helix. These heterotrimeric monomers are stabilized by disulfide bonds that are likely to involve the clusters of cysteine residues that flank the triple helical domain of each chain (12Chu M.L. Pan T.C.

Unlike the other collagens, collagen VI undergoes further intracellular polymerization prior to assembly and is secreted as a tetramer. The hierarchy of assembly and organization of the monomers in the final secreted tetramers have been defined by biosynthetic studies (16Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Ainger K. Bressan G.M. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14454-14460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and detailed electron microscopy examination of the structure of purified collagen VI (17Engel J. Furthmayr H.

Engel J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Dimers form intracellularly by antiparallel alignment of the monomers with a 30-nm stagger, involving interactions of the C-terminal globular region of one monomer with the triple helix of the other. Tetramers, the secreted form of collagen VI, then form by lateral association of dimers. Dimers and tetramers are each linked by two disulfide bonds (18Furthmayr H. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Odermatt E.

J. 1983; 211: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The final stage of collagen VI assembly occurs outside of the cell where tetramers associate end-to-end to form the beaded microfibrils. Although the basic steps in assembly and the structure of the tetramers and microfibrils are well defined, details of the interacting protein domains involved in assembly are still poorly understood. Some insights have resulted from examination of naturally occurring mutations. Detailed biosynthetic studies on a Bethlem myopathy patient with a heterozygous 18-amino acid deletion toward the N-terminal end of the α1(VI) triple helical domain (amino acids 79–96 of the helix) demonstrated that dimer formation is dependent on the native structure of the triple helix in that region (4Lamande S.R.

Triple helical glycine mutations that are N-terminal to this region allow dimer and tetramer formation but reduce the efficiency of microfibril formation (20Lamande S.R. Morgelin M. Selan C. Jobsis G.J. Baas F. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and exon skipping mutations in the N-terminal end of the triple helix interfere with both tetramer and microfibril formation (10Baker N.L.

The use of site-directed mutagenesis to produce alterations in the collagen VI chains is another powerful approach that can be used to identify the protein domains important for correct assembly. Using this approach we have previously shown in transfected SaOS-2 cells that the α3(VI) N5 subdomain is critical for microfibril formation (21Fitzgerald J. Morgelin M. Selan C. Wiberg C. Keene D.R. Lamande S.R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further delineated the α3(VI) subdomains involved in intracellular and extracellular assembly by production and expression of α3(VI) cDNAs containing C-terminal truncations. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the α3(VI) Chain—Four α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs containing premature stop codons within the C-terminal domain were produced using strand overlap extension PCR (22Horton R.M. Pease L. Directed Mutagenesis. 1991; (IRL Press, Oxford): 217-247Google Scholar). To introduce a stop mutation at amino acid 2599 (α3(VI) protein domains N10-C5, bases and amino acids numbered from the start of translation), bases 7000–7803 and 7783–8102 were amplified by PCR in separate reactions using the α3(VI) N6-C5 plasmid (23Lamande S.R.

The overlapping primers each contained two nucleotide substitutions that resulted in the F2599X mutation (TTT-TAG). These primary amplification products were gel-purified and 100 ng of each used as the template in a second round of overlapping PCR. The resulting PCR product (bases 7000–8102) was digested with BbrPI and Eco47III and used to replace the corresponding 130-bp fragment of the α3(VI) N6-C5 plasmid to produce the expression plasmid α3(VI) N6-C1. Similarly, a stop mutation at residue 2864 was introduced by PCR amplification of bases 8302–8598 and 8584–9172 in which the overlapping primers contained the S2864X (TCA-TAG) change. The second round overlapping PCR product (bases 8302–9172) was digested with Bst1107I and RsrII and used to replace the corresponding fragment of a 3-kilobase ApaI-NotI subclone in pGEM5 (Promega). The Eco47III-NotI fragment of α3(VI) N6-C5 was replaced with the mutant fragment to produce the expression plasmid α3(VI) N6-C2. The α3(VI) N6-C3 construct was produced by PCR amplification of bases 8302–8997 and 8962–9172. The overlapping primers contained a Q2995X change (CAG-TAG). The second round overlapping PCR product was digested with Bst1107I and RsrII and the 775 bp product ligated into the ApaI-NotI subclone described above. Finally, the 1950 bp Bst1107I-NotI fragment of this subclone was used to replace the corresponding fragment of α3(VI) N6-C5 to produce the α3(VI) N6-C3 expression plasmid. A similar strategy was used to introduce the M3097X (ATG-TAG) mutation. Bases 8998–9303 and 9283-the polylinker of pRc/CMV were PCR amplified using the α3(VI) N6-C5 plasmid and a template and the second round overlapping PCR product was digested with RsrII and NotI. The 1130 bp fragment was ligated into the ApaI-NotI subclone and then the Bst1107I-NotI fragment of this subclone was used to replace the corresponding fragment of α3(VI) N6-C5 to produce the α3(VI) N6-C4 expression plasmid. To confirm the sequence changes and ensure that no errors had been introduced during PCR and cloning the regions of the mutant constructs that were generated by PCR were sequenced (AmpliCycle™, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (data not shown). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS-2 (ATCC HTB-85) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described previously (23Lamande S.R. Sigalas E. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7423-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). SaOS-2 cells were transfected with the α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into cell lines. G418 was removed from the culture medium after the fourth passage. Collagen VI Biosynthetic Labeling and Analysis—SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 10 cm2 dishes, incubated overnight in the presence of 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, then biosynthetically labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label™ 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc) in 750 μl of methionine-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was removed to a sterile tube and protease inhibitors added to the following final concentrations; 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF), 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 5 mm EDTA. The cell layer was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 containing 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm AEBSF and 20 mm NEM (cell lysis buffer). Cell lysates and medium samples were clarified by centrifugation, and precleared for 1 h with 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Collagen VI was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using either an α3(VI) polyclonal antibody made to the recombinant N1 domain, monoclonal antibody 5C6 that recognizes the collagen VI triple helix (24Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Hessle H. Engvall E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3955-3961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or a polyclonal antibody made to the recombinant C5 domain of the α3(VI) chain (15Mayer U. Poschl E. Nischt R. Specks U. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with NET buffer, then once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min each. Immunoprecipitated collagen VI was eluted into gel loading buffer at 65 °C for 15 min and analyzed following reduction with 25 mm dithiothreitol by SDS-PAGE on 3–8% gradient NuPAGE® gels (Invitrogen). Collagen VI triple helical monomers, dimmers, and tetramers were analyzed on 2.4% (w/v) acrylamide/0.5% (w/v) agarose composite gels under non-reducing conditions as described previously (23Lamande S.R.

Radioactively labeled proteins were detected by fluorography (26Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 4-well chamber Permanox slides (Nalge Nunc International) and then supplemented daily for 15 days with 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. To visualize collagen VI that had been deposited into the extracellular matrix, cell layers were washed with cold PBS 2The abbreviation used is: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. then incubated with either the collagen VI monoclonal antibody 3C4 (24Engvall E.

Bound antibody was detected using Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), and the cell layers were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. In some experiments cell layers were washed with PBS then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The fixed cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min and then 70% ethanol for 1 min prior to incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies as described above. For co-localization experiments cell layers were incubated simultaneously with 3C4 and C5 and bound antibody detected with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-mouse IgG. Slides were mounted in FluorSave™ reagent (Calbiochem) and then viewed and imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope or a Leica TCS CP2 S.E. laser scanning confocal microscope. Human articular cartilage was obtained, from the talus of a 15-year-old boy undergoing surgery for club foot, following informed consent and the approval of the Ethics in Human Research Committee of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne. The tissue was fixed in Histochoice (Amresco) overnight at 4 °C, then 10-μm sections were digested with 0.2% (w/v) hyaluronidase (bovine, type IV, Sigma) for 15 min to unmask epitopes. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with 3C4 (1:1000) and C5 (1:500) in PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, washed with PBS and bound antibodies detected with Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. Sections were imaged with a Leica TCS CP2 S.E. laser scanning confocal microscope. Mica Sandwich Squeezing Rotary Shadowing Electron Microscopy—Confluent SaOS-2 cultures in 80-cm2 flasks were incubated for 18 h in 10 ml of serum-free medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was collected, the protease inhibitors described earlier were added, and sodium azide was included at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). Culture medium was clarified by centrifugation and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate, pH 7.9, in an apparatus designed for small volumes (Biowerk). Samples were mixed with equal volumes of 80% (v/v) glycerol, squeezed between two freshly cleaved mica surfaces and dried under high vacuum for 2 h. They were then shadowed with 2-nm platinum/carbon on a rotating table, and coated with a stabilizing 10-nm carbon film from above. Replicas were floated off on distilled water, picked up on 400 mesh copper grids and observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Collagen VI Intracellular Assembly in Transfected Cells—To explore the role of the α3(VI) C-terminal globular domains in collagen VI intracellular assembly and extracellular microfibril formation, we produced α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs containing premature stop codons. These constructs were designed to direct the synthesis of α3(VI) chains containing subdomains N6-C1, N6-C2, N6-C3, and N6-C4 (Fig. 1). SaOS-2 cells, which express α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNA and protein but no α3(VI) mRNA (23Lamande S.R. Sigalas E. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7423-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were transfected with the control expression plasmid α3(VI) N6-C5, and the mutant constructs and individual cell clones were selected in medium containing G418. To determine if the truncated α3(VI) chains were able to assemble intracellularly with α1(VI) and α2(VI), the cell lines were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and cell and medium fractions immunoprecipitated with the α3(VI)-specific antibody N1. Samples were analyzed on 3–8% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions to visualize the individual collagen VI chains. The five stably transfected cell lines produced comparable amounts of α3(VI) protein (Fig. 2a). The α3(VI) chains migrated with a molecular mass consistent with the expected size of the truncated proteins when compared with the control α3(VI) N6-C5 (Fig. 2a). In all of the cell lines, α1(VI) and α2(VI) were co-immunoprecipitated with the α3(VI)-specific antibody (Fig. 2a) indicating that these chains had formed collagen VI heterotrimers that were able to be secreted. Co-assembly of α1(VI) and α2(VI) with α3(VI) N6-C1 chains clearly demonstrated that subdomains C2-C5 are not required for the initial steps of collagen VI assembly, chain selection, and heterotrimer (monomer) formation. In addition to the α3(VI) N6-C5, N6-C4, N6-C3, and N6-C2 chains, we also consistently observed a small amount of immunoprecipitated protein in the medium of these cell lines that had the same migration as α3(VI) N6-C1 (Fig. 2a, lanes 8–12). This band was not immunoprecipitated from the medium of untransfected parental SaOS-2 cells (Fig. 2a, lane 7) indicating that it was an α3(VI) chain that was recognized by the N1 antibody. This suggested that subdomains C2-C5 may have been specifically cleaved from a proportion of the larger chains by a secreted protease. A second band, that co-migrated with the α3(VI) N6-C2, was also consistently seen (Fig. 2a, lanes 9–12) although in much lower amounts than the smaller N6-C1 co-migrating band. The next stages of collagen VI assembly, the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers and tetramers, were assessed by analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins on non-reducing agarose/acrylamide gels. Tetramers were the predominant form of collagen VI secreted by all of the transfected cell lines (Fig. 2b, lanes 8–12), demonstrating that subdomains C2-C5 are not required for collagen VI dimer and tetramer formation. Collagen VI Microfibril Formation—To determine which cell lines could incorporate collagen VI into an extracellular matrix, parental and transfected SaOS-2 cells were grown for 15 days post-confluence in the presence of sodium ascorbate. To ensure that only extracellular collagen VI was detected the cell layers were stained prior to fixation with the collagen VI antibody 3C4, then examined by fluorescence microscopy. An abundant collagen VI matrix was present in cells expressing α3(VI) N6-C5 (Fig. 3f). In contrast, only weak extracellular collagen VI staining was seen in the parental cell line (Fig. 3a), and the cells expressing α3(VI) N6-C1 (Fig. 3b), and α3(VI) N6-C2 (Fig. 3c). This minute amount of collagen VI extracellular matrix deposition is most likely because of the low level of endogenous α3(VI) mRNA expression that is induced after extended culture of these cells in the presence of sodium ascorbate (23Lamande S.R. Sigalas E. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7423-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In cells expressing α3(VI) N6-C3 and N6-C4 a small amount of collagen VI extracellular staining was seen (Fig. 3, d and e); however, the staining was much less intense than in the N6-C5-expressing cells. These data demonstrate that while the α3(VI) C3 and C4 domains may play a small role in the end-to-end assembly of tetramers into microfibrils the C5 domain is critical for efficient microfibril formation. Secreted collagen VI was also examined by rotary shadowing electron microscopy to visualize the end-to-end assembly of tetramers (Fig. 4A). Microfibril formation in the transfected cell lines was quantified by examination of a large number of micrograph fields (Fig. 4B). The occurrence of “microfibrils” containing 1–10 tetramers is shown as a percentage of the total number of microfibrils. In cells expressing control α3(VI) N6-C5 chains, 86% of the microfibrils contained 2–10 tetramers and only 14% were single tetramers. In stark contrast, almost none of the tetramers containing α3(VI) N6-C2 chains had associated end-to-end with another tetramer and assemblies containing more than three tetramers were never observed. Some association of the N6-C3 and N6-C4 containing tetramers was seen, although at low levels when compared with the N6-C5 containing tetramers. In N6-C3 and N6-C4 cell lines around 70% of the “microfibrils” were single tetramers and around 30% of the microfibrils contained 2–6 tetramers. This is consistent with the small amount of collagen VI immunostaining that was present in the extracellular matrix of these cell lines. Together, the immunostaining and microfibril quantitation data indicate that the α3(VI) C5 subdomain is critical for the interactions between tetramers that promote efficient microfibril formation. The α3(VI) C5 Domain Is Present in the Extracellular Matrix—A number of studies have suggested that the C-terminal end of the α3(VI) chain is cleaved after secretion. The most recent have used an antibody specific for the α3(VI) C5 domain and have shown that C5 is present on α3(VI) chains synthesized and secreted by cultured cells, but C5 cannot be detected in the extracellular matrix of cultured cells or tissues (15Mayer U.

Poschl E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggesting that processing of the α3(VI) chain may be an obligatory step in microfibril formation. The precise cleavage site in the C-terminal domain was not determined in these studies. Our observation that each of the transfected SaOS-2 cell lines contained an α3(VI) band in the medium that had the same migration as the α3(VI) N6-C1 chain (Fig. 2a, lanes 8–12) raised the possibility that the protease cleavage site was between the C1 and C2 domains. To explore the nature and origin of the α3(VI) N6-C1 band further, radiolabeled collagen VI secreted by SaOS-2 cells expressing α3(VI) N6-C5 was immunoprecipitated with three different antibodies and analyzed under reducing conditions on polyacrylamide gels. As observed previously, the antibody to the α3(VI) N1 domain immunoprecipitated α3(VI) N6-C5 chains as well as the α3(VI) N6-C1 band (Fig. 5, lane 8), indicating that the N1 domain was included in this protein. Despite efficient immunoprecipitation of the α3(VI) N6-C5 chains with the C5 antibody, only minute amounts of the N6-C1 band could be seen (Fig. 5, lane 9) indicating that this band lacked the C5 domain and did indeed result from cleavage in the C terminus of the α3(VI) chain, between C1 and C2. The monoclonal antibody 5C6 recognizes a"

It protects the parasite from hostile environments in the sandfly vector and mammalian host and supports steps of development and invasion. Therefore, new therapeutic concepts concentrate on disturbing glycocalyx biosynthesis. Deletion of genes involved in the metabolism of galactose and mannose have been shown to drastically reduce Leishmania virulence. Here we report the identification of Leishmania major UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP). UGP catalyzes the formation of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP. This activation step enables glucose to enter metabolic pathways and is crucial for the activation of galactose. UDP-galactose is made from UDP-glucose by nucleotide-donor transfer to galactose 1-phosphate or by epimerization of the glucose moiety. Isolated in a complementation cloning approach, the activity of L. major UGP was proven in vitro. Moreover, purified protein was used to investigate enzyme kinetics, quaternary organization, and binding of ligands. Whereas sequestration by oligomerization is a known regulatory mechanism for eukaryotic UGPs, the recombinant as well as native L. major UGP migrated as monomer in size exclusion chromatography and in accord with this showed simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward all substrates. In saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR studies, we clearly demonstrated that the molecular geometry at position 4 of glucose is responsible for substrate specificity. Furthermore, the γ-phosphate group of UTP is essential for binding and for induction of the open conformation, which then allows entry of glucose 1-phosphate.

Our data provide the first direct proof for the ordered bi-bi mechanism suggested in earlier studies. Leishmania are protozoan parasites that cause severe diseases in human and animals. Depending on the Leishmania strain, disease manifestations can range from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral forms (1WHO Expert Committee The Leishmaniasis. 1984; (World Health Organization, Geneva)Google Scholar). Based on records of the World Health Organization, 12 million people are infected worldwide, but no vaccine or specific drug is available to prevent or treat Leishmaniasis. Leishmania are covered by a dense glycoconjugate layer, the glycocalyx, which helps the parasite to withstand hostile environments in the sandfly vector and mammalian host. Moreover, structural changes in glycocalyx components accompany the life cycle of the parasites and are crucial for the transmission of the parasite (2Naderer T. Vince J.E. McConville M.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 649-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 3Sacks D.L. Modi G. Rowton E. Spath G. Epstein L. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A major component of the glycoconjugates is galactose, which is dynamically added in the Golgi apparatus. Both transport of galactose to the Golgi lumen and insertion into glycoconjugates depend on the synthesis of the nucleotide sugar UDP-Gal in the cytoplasm of the cell. Whereas synthesis of most nucleotide sugars is catalyzed by pyrophosphorylases using the respective nucleotide triphosphate as substrate (for a review, see Ref. 4Reiter W.D. Vanzin G.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 95-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), activation of galactose is achieved by nucleotide exchange between UDP-Glc and galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P). 3The abbreviations used are: Gal-1-P, galactose 1-phosphate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UGT, UDP-galactose transporter; UGP, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; STD, saturation transfer difference; Glc-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; Rib, ribose; Uri, uridine.3The abbreviations used are: Gal-1-P, galactose 1-phosphate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; UGT, UDP-galactose transporter; UGP, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; STD, saturation transfer difference; Glc-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; Rib, ribose; Uri, uridine. Alternatively, epimerization of sugar position 4 in UDP-Glc leads to UDP-Gal (for a review, see Ref. 5Holden H.M. Rayment I. Thoden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43885-43888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The two ways of galactose activation are shown in Fig. 1. The scheme in addition highlights the fact that UDP-Gal synthesis essentially depends on the availability of UDP-Glc. Knowing the importance of galactose-containing glycoconjugates for Leishmania major virulence (6Zhang K. Barron T. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 7Spath G.F. Garraway L.A. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9536-9541Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the aim of this study was to identify potential L. major UDP-Gal transporters (UGTs). In this context, it is important to mention that galactose in Leishmania exists in two conformers, as pyranose and furanose (8McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 9Turco S.J. Orlandi Jr., P.A. Homans S.W. Ferguson Dwek M.A. Rademacher R. A.T.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7385-7394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas galactopyranose is ubiquitously present in the animal kingdom (referred to as galactose), galactofuranose is unknown (11Pedersen L.L. Turco S.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) but is believed to be an essential virulence (sometimes even viability) factor for various pathogens (12Pan F. Jackson M. Ma Y. McNeil M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3991-3998Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because the formation of UDP-Gal and the synthesis of UDP-galactofuranose from UDP-Gal by the enzyme UDP-galactopyranose mutase (13Bakker H. Kleczka B. Gerardy-Schahn R. Routier F.H. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Beverley S.M. Owens K.L. Showalter M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Jones V.C. McNeil M.R. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) proceeds in the cytoplasm, Golgi transport systems for both UDP-Gal conformers should exist in L. major. To identify these transporters, a heterologous complementation cloning approach was initiated using an L. major cDNA library and UGT-negative Lec8 cells as hosts. Different from the expected results, we identified the L. major UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP; EC 2.7.7.9), an enzyme located upstream of the Golgi transporters. As shown in Fig. 1, UGP catalyzes the synthesis of UDP-Glc from glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) and UTP and thus provides an essential substrate for UDP-Gal formation. Moreover, UGP activity is required for the entry of galactose into glycolysis and thus for its availability in energy production. Finally, UDP-Glc itself is transported into the Golgi and used by glucosyltransferases that dynamically decorate glycoconjugates (15McConville M.J. Mullin K.A. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 122-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The strategically important position of the newly identified gene prompted us to carefully investigate its catalytic properties and thus eventually evaluate a novel target for future therapeutic approaches. Cells and Reagents—The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line Lec8 (Stanley) was obtained from ATCC and cultured in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). A cDNA library was constructed from the promastigote form of L. major in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Script (Stratagene). The rat glucuronyltransferase cDNA clone in the vector pEFBOS (16Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) was used in cotransfection experiments (pEFBOS-GlcAT). The rat monoclonal antibody L2-412 recognizing the HNK-1 epitope was kindly provided by M. Schachner (Hamburg, Germany), and goat anti-rat alkaline phosphatase was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Plasmids pOTB7-hUGP1 and pCMV-hUGP2 containing cDNAs of the human UGP isoforms a and b, respectively, were kindly provided by the RZPD Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum für Genomforschung GmbH (library number 958 clone IMAGp958H18235Q2 and library number 998 clone IMAGp998K047340Q3, respectively). pET expression vectors and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen. The E. coli DEV6 galU mutant strain (17Remes B. Elseviers D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the coli genetic stock collection at the E. coli genetic resource center, Yale University (New Haven, CT). Complementation Cloning in CHO Lec8 Cells—Since isolation of a L. major UGT was the initial goal of this study, complementation cloning in CHO Lec8 cells was used as a strategy. For the heterologous complementation cloning approach, an L. major cDNA library was constructed from 5 μg of mRNA using the pCMV-ScriptXR cDNA library construction kit from Stratagene. The mRNA sample was purified from total RNA of the promastigote form of L. major (V121) with the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen). To enable sibling selection, the cDNA library was subdivided into 86 pools of 20,000 independent colonies. The plasmid DNA was transiently transfected into CHO Lec8 cells, and positive pools were identified by immunocytochemistry as described below. Of 22 tested pools, eight were able to complement Lec8 cells. The Me2SO stock corresponding to the positive pool 19 was selected and subdivided into pools of 1500 individual colonies. Plasmid DNA was isolated from subpools, and transfection and monitoring were repeated. After six rounds of sibling selection, a single cDNA clone (pACM1), which efficiently complemented Lec8 cells, was isolated. For transient expression of human UGPs (isoforms a and b) in CHO Lec8 cells, the corresponding cDNAs were amplified from the plasmids pOTB7-hUGP1 and pCMV-hUGP2 with the primer pairs ACM 10 (CGCGGGATCCTCGAGATTTGTACAAGATC)/ACM 9 (ATATGCGGCCGCTCAGTGGTCCAAGATGC) and ACM8 (CGCGGGATCCTCTCAAGATGGTGCTTC)/ACM9 (ATATGCGGCCGCTCAGTGGTCCAAGATGC), respectively. Because the primers contained BamHI and NotI restriction sites (underlined), products could be digested with BamHI/NotI and, after gel purification (Qiagen), ligated into the corresponding restriction sites of pcDNA3-FLAG (18Munster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Muhlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids pFL-hUGP1 and pFL-hUGP2 drive the expression of N-terminally FLAG-tagged proteins. For comparison, the L. major UGP was similarly amplified from cDNA library pool 19 using the primer pair ACM5 (CGCGGGATCCGAAAACGACATGAAGTCCCTCAGC) and ACM6 (CGTGGCGGCCGCTTAGGCACCATCGGGGATCACAAAC), containing BamHI and NotI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. After endonuclease digestion and gel purification, the DNA fragments were inserted into pcDNA3-FLAG as described above. The resulting vector was named pFL-LmUGP. Complementation by the hamster UGT (pcNDA3-FLAG-SO1) (19Oelmann S. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol.

All constructs were transiently transfected into CHO Lec8 cells and analyzed by immunocytochemistry (see below). Transient Transfection and Immunocytochemistry—For transient transfections, 3 × 105 Lec8 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and 24 h later co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the respective cDNA plus 0.5 μg of the plasmid pEFBOS-GlcAT, encoding the rat glucuronyltransferase (16Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and stopped after 6–8 h by medium exchange. Complementation was analyzed by immunocytochemistry with the monoclonal antibody L2-412 directed against the HNK-1 epitope (20Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This methodology used to monitor complementation of Lec8 cells has been recently developed and approved in our laboratory (21Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h after transfection, CHO Lec8 cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, fixed with 1.5% glutaraldehyde (10 min), blocked in 2% milk powder/Tris-buffered saline (30 min), and stained with the rat monoclonal antibody L2-412 for 1 h. After washing with Tris-buffered saline, bound monoclonal antibody L2-412 was detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody. Fast-Red (Sigma) was used as substrate. Recombinant Expression of L. major UGP—To recombinantly express L. major UGP, the entire open reading frame was amplified with the primer pair ACM112 (CTGACTCCATATGGAAAAGCACATGAAGTCCCTC) and ACM69 (CTTAGCGGCCGCCTTGTTGGTCGACTGCTGCG), containing NdeI and NotI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and NotI, gel-purified, and ligated into the corresponding sites of pET22b (Novagen). The resulting plasmid pET-UGP-His encodes the full-length, C-terminally His6-tagged L. major UGP. To generate the vector pET-UGP, allowing the expression of an untagged L. major UGP, the primer pair ACM 112 and ACM 7 (CTTAGCGGCCGCCATTACTTGTTGGTCGACTGCTGCG) was used, and the PCR product was ligated into the NdeI and NotI restriction sites of pET22b. Integrity of the constructs was confirmed by sequencing. For expression, E. coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with the corresponding plasmid, and cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 200 μg/ml carbenicillin at 15 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6. Then protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture continued for 20 h. Thereafter, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and pellets were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl) if used for Ni2+-chelating chromatography or in buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) if used for anion exchange chromatography, both supplemented with 40 μg/ml bestatin (Sigma), 4 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Applied Science). Bacteria were lysed by sonification with a microtip (Branson Sonifer, 50% duty cycle, output control 5) using eight pulses of 30 s intermitted by breaks of 30 s. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the soluble fractions were used for SDS-PAGE analyses or submitted to Ni2+-chelating or anion exchange chromatography to purify the recombinant protein. Ni2+-chelating and Anion Exchange Chromatography—To purify the His6-tagged L. major UGP, soluble fractions of transformed bacteria, prepared as described above, were passed over a 5-ml HisTrapHP Ni2+-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 300 mm NaCl) followed by 30 ml of buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in buffer A using a step gradient. For anion exchange chromatography, the soluble bacterial fraction was passed over a 1-ml Q-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences), and the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0). The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in 20 ml. The fractions containing L. major UGP were pooled and for buffer exchange passed over a HiPrep 26/10 column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified protein samples were stored at –80 °C in buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2). Preparation of L. major Cytosolic Fraction—Promastigote L. major (MHOM/SU/73/5ASKH) was grown in M199 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm adenine, 0.0005% hemin, 0.0002% biotin, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin to a density of 4–5 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing in buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2), and the 100,000 × g supernatant was used for size exclusion chromatography. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) was used to determine the quaternary organization of the recombinant L. major UGP. Before sample loading, the column was equilibrated with 50 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2). In consecutive runs, the column was loaded with 100 μl of standard proteins (bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml), bovine carbonic anhydrase (3 mg/ml), and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (5 mg/ml)) as described by the manufacturer (protein standard kit; Sigma). Purified recombinant His6-tagged or untagged L. major UGP (4 mg/ml) was loaded in the absence or presence of the substrates UTP (1 mm) and Glc-1-P (1 mm). Similarly, the L. major cytosolic fraction (3.5 mg/ml) was loaded to investigate the native protein. Complementation of E. coli DEV6 galU Mutant—E. coli DEV6 galU mutants lack a functional UGP. This defect renders the bacterium unable to grow on galactose-containing MacConkey agar. For complementation assays, chemically competent E. coli DEV6 galU mutants were transformed with the plasmid pET-UGP-His or pET-UGP or the empty vector pET22b and grown on 2% Luria-Bertani agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were streaked on 2% MacConkey (base) (BD Biosciences) agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 2% galactose as carbohydrate source. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Complementation of the galU mutation was indicated by the size of colonies and a color change from white to red in the presence of the pH indicator phenol red. In Vitro Testing of UGP Activity—Under in vitro conditions, UGPs are able to catalyze both forward (formation of UDP-Glc and PPi from UTP and Glc-1-P) and reverse reaction (UDP-Glc and PPi are used to produce UTP and Glc-1-P). The in vitro activity was measured by coupled enzymatic assays resulting in the reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H + H+, which was determined at 340 nm and 25 °C. The assay mixture to analyze the forward reaction contained the following (22Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar): 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm UTP (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm Glc-1-P (Sigma), 1 mm NAD+ (Roche Applied Science), and 0.05 units of UDP-Glc dehydrogenase (Calbiochem). The assay mixture for the reverse reaction contained the following (modified from Ref. 23Duggleby R.G. Chao Y.C. Huang J.G. Peng H.L. Chang H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar): 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm UDP-Glc (Sigma), 50 mm PPi (Sigma), 25 mm NADP+ (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm glucose 1,6-bisphosphate (Sigma), 2.5 units of phosphoglucomutase (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Applied Science). The total assay volume was 750μl. Enzyme reactions were started by the addition of UGP. The initial linear rates of cofactor reduction were used to calculate the enzymatic activities by conversion of the increase in A340 nm to micromoles of NAD(P)H + H+ production based on its extinction coefficient. When the assay system was used to determine UGP activity with Gal-1-P as substrate, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm UTP, 2 mm Gal-1-P (Calbiochem), 1 mm NAD+, 0.05 units of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase and 0.05 units of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (Calbiochem). All other assay conditions were identical. To determine Km values, one substrate was present at a saturating concentration, whereas the concentration of the second substrate was varied. The initial rates were plotted against the substrate concentration, and the Excel Solver program (Microsoft) was used to approximate the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (V = Vmax ([S]/([S] + Km)). In addition, Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to show the linear dependence and to calculate the Km values. Antibody Preparation—An antiserum against L. major UGP was prepared by subcutaneous injection of New Zealand rabbits with 500 μg of purified recombinant protein. For the first injection, protein was mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco), followed by six injections at 6-week intervals using incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Difco). Blood was collected 10 days after the last injection. The prepared serum specifically recognizes both recombinant and native forms of the L. major UGP. SDS-PAGE Analysis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels composed of a 5% stacking gel and a 10% separating gel. Protein bands were visualized by silver staining (25Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). His6-tagged proteins were detected using the penta-His antibody (Qiagen) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and goat anti-mouse Ig alkaline phosphatase-conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Untagged L. major UGP was detected using a 1:60,000 dilution of antiserum and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). DNA and Protein Sequence Analysis—Homology searches were performed at the National Centre for Biotechnology Information using the program BLASTX2.2.3. For multiple alignments, the program MultAlin version 5.4.1 (26Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4306) Google Scholar) was used. NMR—All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance DRX 600 MHz spectrometer at 298 K in deuterated 50 mm Trisd5, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.8. NMR-based Enzyme Assays—In a typical 1H NMR experiment, a spectrum of a mixture containing 1 mm Glc-1-P and 1 mm UTP was acquired at t = 0 min. After the addition of 200 ng of purified UGP, 1H NMR spectra were recorded in 10-min time intervals over 1 h. Suppression of the residual HDO signal was achieved by presaturation with a weak radio frequency field for 1.5 s during the relaxation delay. Data acquisition and processing were performed with XWINNMR software (Bruker) on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station. Fourier transformation and base-line correction were performed for the 1H NMR experiment at t = 0 min. STD-NMR Experiments—STD-NMR experiments (27Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) were performed at 298 K and pH 7.8. The protein was saturated on resonance at 0.7 ppm and off resonance at 40 ppm with a cascade of 40 selective Gaussian-shaped pulses of 50-ms duration with a 100-μs delay between each pulse in all STD-NMR experiments. The total duration of the saturation time was set to 2 s. For STD-NMR experiments, 0.6 μm recombinant UGP was used. All investigated ligands were added at a molecular ratio (protein/ligand) of 1:100. A total of 1024 scans/STD-NMR experiment were acquired, and a WATERGATE sequence was used to suppress the residual HDO signal. A spin lock filter with a strength of 5 kHz and a duration of 10 ms was applied to suppress protein background. Relative STD effects were calculated according to the equation ASTD = (I0 – Isat)/I0 = ISTD/I0 by comparing the intensity of the signals in the STD-NMR spectrum (ISTD) with signal intensities of a reference spectrum (I0). The STD signal with the highest intensity was set to 100%, and other STD signals were calculated accordingly (28Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Isolation and Functional Characterization of the L. major UDP-glucose Pyrophosphorylase—Because the initial goal of our study was the characterization of UGT from L. major, heterologous complementation in UGT-deficient CHO Lec8 cells was selected as a strategy to clone the gene. Technically, the complementation approach followed a recently established protocol, which allowed the isolation of UGT activities from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library (21Bakker H. Routier F. Oelmann S. Jordi W. Lommen A. Gerardy-Schahn R. Bosch D. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To enable sibling selection, a cDNA library constructed from the promastigote (sandfly) form of L. major in the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV-Script was subdivided into pools of 2 × 104 cDNAs. Plasmid cDNA was isolated from individual pools and transiently transfected into Lec8 cells together with a cDNA encoding the rat glucuronyltransferase (16Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Complementation of the UGT defect in the presence of the rat glucuronyltransferase results in the cell surface expression of glucuronic acid β1,3-linked to galactose, an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody L2-412 (20Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). After six rounds of sibling selection, a complementing cDNA clone named pACM1 was isolated (data not shown). The isolated cDNA contained an open reading frame of 1485 bp and encoded a protein of 494 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 54.5 kDa. To prove that the cloned gene belonged to the nucleotide sugar transporter family, a data base alignment was carried out with the program BLASTX2.2.3 (NCBI). Unexpectedly, this analysis showed that the protein encoded in pACM1 exhibited about 30% identity to eukaryotic UGPs (supplemental Fig. S1). Like the other eukaryotic enzymes, the L. major sequence harbors the characteristic pyrophosphorylase consensus motif (KLNGGLGTXMGX4K; Fig. S1) known to be essential for catalytic activity (29Peneff C. Ferrari P. Charrier V. Taburet Y. Monnier C. Zamboni V. Winter J. Harnois M. Fassy F. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6191-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Different from all other eukaryotic UGPs, the L. major enzyme contains an insertion of 14 amino acids at position 263 (Fig. S1). L. major UGP Complements the E. coli Mutant DEV6 galU—UGPs catalyze the synthesis of UDP-Glc and PPi from Glc-1-P and UTP. UDP-Glc is a central compound in carbohydrate synthesis and in metabolic pathways, since it is required for the entry of galactose into the glycolytic pathway in bacterial and eukaryotic cells (Fig. 1). Consequently, the E. coli galU mutant strain DEV6, which exhibits a defect in the ugp, has lost its ability to ferment galactose. This defect renders the bacterium unable to grow on agar containing galactose as the only carbohydrate source. Upon transformation with the L. major UGP cDNA, the phenotype of the E. coli galU mutant strain DEV6 could be restored, and the mutant was able to grow on MacConkey-galactose agar (data not shown). Taken together, these results unequivocally identified pACM1 to encode a functional UGP. In contrast, the ques"

MPO-derived reactive chlorinating species attack membrane plasmalogens releasing α-chloro fatty aldehydes including 2-chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA), which have been found to accumulate in activated neutrophils, activated monocytes, infarcted myocardium and human atheromas. The present study employed synthetically prepared 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA as well as stable isotope-labeled 2-ClHDA to elucidate the metabolism of 2-ClHDA. The results herein demonstrate that human coronary artery endothelial cells oxidize and reduce 2-ClHDA to its respective chlorinated fatty acid (α-ClFA) and chlorinated fatty alcohol (α-ClFOH). Within the first hour of incubations of human coronary artery endothelial cells with 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA, the label was incorporated into the α-ClFOH and α-ClFA pools. After 1 h, the radiolabel was predominantly found in the α-ClFOH pool. Cell-derived α-ClFOH and α-ClFA were also released into the cell culture medium. Additionally, chlorinated fatty acid was incorporated into complex endothelial cell glycerolipids, including monoglycerides, triglycerides, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The oxidation and reduction of 2-ClHDA to α-ClFA and α-ClFOH, respectively, was further supported by mass spectrometric analyses of human coronary artery endothelial cells incubated with either 2-ClHDA or stable isotope-labeled 2-ClHDA (2-Cl-[d4]-HDA). 2-ClHDA was also oxidized to α-ClFA and reduced to α-ClFOH in both control and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated neutrophils. Taken together, these results show that a family of chlorinated lipidic metabolites is produced from α-chloro fatty aldehydes derived from reactive chlorinating species targeting of plasmalogens.

The accumulation of α-chloro fatty aldehyde in atherosclerotic lesions and in infarcted myocardium, coupled with the potential role this lipid may have on cardiovascular function, underscore the importance of determining the mechanisms responsible for α-chloro fatty aldehyde catabolism. Many aldehydes found in vivo are produced through free radical mechanisms. The cytotoxicity of aldehydes is attenuated by reduction, oxidation, or conjugation with glutathione (25O'Brien P.J.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase oxidizes the aldehyde to its carboxylic acid. Human liver microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase is specific for medium- and long-chain fatty aldehydes (31Kelson T.L. Secor McVoy J.R. Rizzo W.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1335: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A mutation in this fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase has been linked to Sjögren-Larsson syndrome (32De Laurenzi V. Rogers G.R. Hamrock D.J. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. Compton J.G. Markova N. Rizzo W.B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Alternatively, long-chain fatty aldehydes can be reduced to their respective fatty alcohols (33Kawalek J.C. Gilbertson J.R.

Additionally, aldehydes can diffuse within, or escape from, their cells of origin and form covalent adducts with proteins and phospholipids. Reactive aldehydes have been shown to react with primary amines on proteins to form Schiff base adducts and Michael addition products (formed by the nucleophilic attack on an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde such as 4-hydroxynonenal). In fact, 4-hydroxynonenal has been shown to covalently modify low density lipoprotein apolipoproteins contributing to the formation of a high uptake form of low density lipoprotein and to form protein adducts during ischemia-reperfusion injury (36Eaton P.

Understanding the metabolism of α-chloro fatty aldehyde may be critical in revealing the role of this novel plasmalogen oxidation product in cardiovascular disease. Accordingly, the present study was designed to elucidate the metabolism of the α-chloro fatty aldehyde, 2-chlorohexadecanal (2-ClHDA). The results herein demonstrate that both endothelial cells and neutrophils oxidize and reduce 2-ClHDA to its respective chlorinated fatty acid and chlorinated fatty alcohol, which are subsequently incorporated into complex glycerolipids. Synthesis and Purification of 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA and 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA—2-Cl-[d4]-HDA was synthesized and purified as previously described (24Thukkani A.K. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. Wysolmerski R.B. Albert C.J. Ford D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3842-3849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA was synthesized and purified by a modification of the synthetic scheme employed for 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA (24Thukkani A.K.

For this scheme, [9,10-3H]-hexadecanol was prepared by the reduction of [9,10-3H]-hexadecanoic acid (0.256 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The purity of the synthetic 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA was determined by TLC of underivatized 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA and TLC of its corresponding dimethylacetal and pentafluorobenzyl oxime derivatives using petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (90/10/1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. Synthesis of 2-Chlorohexadecanoic Acid and 2-Chlorohexadecanol—Hexadecanoic acid (16:0 fatty acid (FA)) and [d4]-16:0 FA were subjected to α-chlorination with chlorine(g) using the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction and phosphorous as the catalyst (40Van den Bergen H. Daloze D. Braekman J.C. J. Braz. Chem. Soc. 1999; 10: 1-12Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Briefly, 16:0 FA was melted at 80 °C before an equimolar amount of phosphorous trichloride in dichloromethane was added to the reaction vial. Chlorine(g) was then slowly bubbled into the reaction mixture for 1 h. The crude product was sequentially extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer method (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar), TLC-purified (silica gel G TLC plates with a mobile phase composed of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v) (RF = 0.24)), and then further purified on a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor liquid chromatograph equipped with a Beckman RP Ultrasphere™ ODS (5 μ, 4.6 mm × 25 cm) column coupled to a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Products were eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min from the stationary phase with a mobile phase composed of 85/15 MeOH/H2O containing 0.02% formic acid (A) for 3 min followed by a linear gradient from 100% A to 100% MeOH (B) over 7 min. The solid phase was further eluted with 100% B for 10 min. The LC eluate was split 10:1, and the LC-purified reaction products were detected by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry using selected ion monitoring (SIM) of m/z 289 ([M – H]– of 2-Cl-16:0 FA) or m/z 293 ([M – H]– of [d4]2-Cl-16:0 FA) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the loss of HCl of m/z 289 → m/z 253 or m/z 293 → m/z 257 in the negative ion mode (electrospray needle voltage = 5 kV, capillary T = 320 °C, collision energy = 15 eV) (tr for the 2-Cl-16:0 FA and [d4]2-Cl-16:0 FA were 8.55 and 8.53 min, respectively). 2-ClHDA and 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA were resuspended in 2 ml of radical free ethyl ether and 0.5 ml of benzene and treated with Vitride™ reagent (sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride) for 30 min at 37 °C (42Ford D.A. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1216-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resultant 2-chlorohexadecanol (α-ClFOH) was purified by TLC (petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v)) (RF = 0.41). 2-ClHDA Metabolism in Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells—Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) (Cell Applications, Inc.) were grown to confluency on 60-mm tissue culture plates (Corning) in EGM®-2-MV medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum following the supplier's instructions at 37 °C with 100% humidity and 5% CO2 (passages 4–10). Confluent HCAEC were incubated with selected concentrations of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA (0.1 μm (256 mCi/mmol), 1 μm (256 mCi/mmol), or 10 μm (25.6 mCi/mmol)) in 5 ml of normal growth medium at 37 °C for selected time intervals. At the end of each experimental interval, lipids in the cell culture medium were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). The cell culture plates containing the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Subsequently, the cells were scraped with methanol:water (1:1, v/v) prior to lipid extraction by the method of Bligh and Dyer (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). Lipids extracted from the cells or culture medium lipids were stored in chloroform under nitrogen prior to analyses by chromatography. For pulse-chase experiments, HCAEC were incubated (pulse) with 1 μm 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA (256 mCi/mmol) for 30 min. Following this 30-min pulse radiolabeling interval, the cell culture medium was removed from HCAEC, and the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with cell culture medium containing 10 μm 2-ClHDA for selected time intervals (chase). At the end of each chase interval, radiolabeled lipid metabolites of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA associated with the HCAEC, as well as the cell culture medium, were prepared for analyses (see above). Parallel experiments were performed using stable isotope-labeled 2-ClHDA. In these experiments, HCAEC were incubated with 10 μm 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA for either 3 or 24 h. Extracting the lipids from the cells and cell culture medium terminated the incubations, as described above. Stable isotope-labeled metabolites of 2-ClHDA were subsequently purified by TLC and analyzed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry or GC-MS. 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA Metabolism in Human Neutrophils—Whole blood (50 ml) was taken from healthy volunteers and anti-coagulated with EDTA (final concentration 5.4 mm) prior to the isolation of neutrophils using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient as previously described (43Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Pelleted neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/condition) were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.3) supplemented with both MgSO4 and CaCl2 at 1 mm and immediately incubated with 1 μm 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA (256 mCi/mmol) in the presence or absence of 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 0, 15, 30, or 60 min at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted and washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution before the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar). Thin Layer Chromatographic Analyses of 2-ClHDA Metabolites—Neutral lipid metabolites of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA were purified from crude lipid extracts using silica gel 60 TLC plates (Whatman) as a solid phase with a mobile phase composed of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v) (44Ford D.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2644-2650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, polar lipid metabolites of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA were purified on the same solid phase but with a mobile phase composed of chloroform/methanol/water (65/35/4, v/v/v). Lipid metabolites were further characterized by two-dimensional TLC plates using silica gel 60 TLC plates and an initial mobile phase composed of chloroform/methanol/ammonia (65/25/5, v/v/v) followed by development in the second dimension with a mobile phase composed of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (3/4/1/1/0.5, v/v/v/v/v). Radioactivity associated with lipid metabolites of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA that was resolved on TLC plates was detected by fluorography. In brief, the developed TLC plates were treated with EN3HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to exposure to x-ray film (Kodak) at –80 °C. Alternatively, parallel TLC plates or lanes (on TLC plates) were developed with lipid standards, and silica from regions associated with specific lipids was scraped from the plate. Radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Additionally, silica associated with regions of TLC plates detected by fluorography was also scraped from the plate and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Chlorinated Fatty Alcohols—TLC-purified chlorinated fatty alcohols were converted to their respective pentafluorobenzoyl esters using 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzoyl chloride (PFB-Cl) at 60 °C for 45 min (45Wildsmith K.R. Albert C.J. Hsu F.-F. Kao J.L.-F. Ford D.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 139: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis of PFB esters was performed using a Hewlett Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 6890 gas chromatograph and 5973 mass spectrometer using the negative ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. The source temperature was set at 150 °C. The electron energy was 240 eV, and the emission current was 300 mA. The PFB derivatives were separated on a J & W Scientific (Folsom, CA) DB-1 column (12.5 m, 0.2 mm inner diameter, 0.33 mm film thickness). The injector and the transfer line temperatures were maintained at 250 °C. The GC oven was maintained at 150 °C for 3.5 min, increased at a rate of 30 °C/min to 270 °C, and held at 270 °C for an additional 2 min. Chlorinated Fatty Acids—For fatty acid analyses, cells treated with 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA and [d4]-chlorinated fatty acids were first TLC-purified and subsequently subjected to LC-MS as described above for the synthesis of 2-Cl-16:0 FA. For these analyses, fatty acid molecular species were resolved using a Supelco Discovery® HS C18 5 μ column (15 cm × 2.1 mm) as the stationary phase at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The 2-Cl-16:0 FA was detected by SRM as described above, and [d4]-16:0 FA was detected by SIM m/z 259 in the negative ion mode (electrospray needle voltage = 3.5 kV, capillary T = 320 °C). Chlorinated Fatty Acid Residues in Phosphatidylcholine—TLC-purified phosphatidylcholine (PC), from lipid extracts of cells treated with either 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA or 2-Cl-[d4]-HDA, was incubated with lipase from Rhizopus arrhizus (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C in a bilayer consisting of 0.1 m borate buffer (pH 6.5) and ethyl ether. Lipase reaction products were then extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method and were purified using silica gel 60 TLC plates with a mobile phase composed of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v). TLC-purified reaction products were first visualized by fluorography. Silica associated with regions of the TLC plate containing radioactivity (visualized by fluorography) were subsequently scraped and quantified by scintillation spectroscopy. For experiments employing stable isotope labeling, bands corresponding to authentic FA and α-ClFA were extracted and analyzed by LC-MS for [d4]-16:0 FA and [d4]2-Cl-16:0 FA content. Additionally, radiolabeled TLC-purified PC was subjected to either base or acid methanolysis. The resultant 2-ClFAME and FAME was analyzed by TLC and fluorography. Synthetic 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA—2-Cl-[3H]-HDA was synthesized, purified, and used to elucidate α-chloro fatty aldehyde metabolism in both HCAEC and neutrophils. Fig. 1A demonstrates that synthetic 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA migrates to the same region as that of unlabeled authentic 2-ClHDA. Furthermore, conversion of the synthetic 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA as well as authentic 2-ClHDA to their dimethylacetal derivatives or their pentafluorobenzyl oxime derivatives further demonstrated the purity of the radiolabel. Additionally, Fig. 1B is an overdevelopment of a fluorograph of the synthetic 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA, which demonstrates the purity of this radiolabeled aldehyde. Metabolism of 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA in HCAEC—HCAEC were incubated with cell culture medium containing 1 μm 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA for either 1 min, 3 or 24 h, and the incorporation of the radiolabel into the lipid metabolites was analyzed by two-dimensional TLC (Fig. 2). These experiments demonstrated that 2-ClHDA was taken up rapidly by HCAEC, and radiolabel derived from 2-ClHDA was eventually incorporated into complex glycerolipids in the HCAEC, including phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Radiolabel in these complex glycerolipids remained in the HCAEC and was not released. Additionally, radiolabel derived from 2-ClHDA was found in the α-chloro fatty alcohol (α-ClFOH) and α-chloro fatty acid (α-ClFA) pools of the cells, as well as these same lipid pools in the cell culture medium (Fig. 2). 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA was not metabolized by cell culture medium without cells present (data not shown). Thus, these results revealed that radiolabeled 2-ClHDA is readily oxidized and reduced to fatty acids and fatty alcohols, respectively, in the cells and that these metabolites are released from the cells. It is likely that the radiolabeled fatty acid is incorporated into the complex glycerolipids. The temporal course of the incorporation of radiolabel from 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA into cellular lipid pools is shown in greater detail in Fig. 3. For these experiments, lipid classes were separated by one-dimensional TLC using mobile phases that separate either neutral or polar lipid classes. After 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA enters the HCAEC, it is rapidly reduced to α-ClFOH within the first hour of labeling (Fig. 3, inset). Radiolabel also is found in the α-ClFA pool within the first hour. Fig. 3B shows the incorporation of the radioactivity derived from 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA into the polar lipid pools. The majority of the radioactivity in the polar lipid pools is associated with phosphatidylcholine, and this appears after the first hour of radiolabeling, which suggests that 2-Cl-[3H]-HDA is first oxidized to fatty acids prior to its incorporation into phosphatidylcholine. It should be noted that the migrations of α-ClFA and α-ClFOH using TLC are considerably different from non-chlorinated FA and FOH. The assignment of radiolabel to α-ClFA and α-ClFOH is based on the co-migration of radiolabel during TLC with regions of authentic α-ClFA and α-ClFOH. Using a mobile phase of petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70/30/1) and a silica gel 60 solid phase, the RF for FA and α-ClFA are 0.34 and 0.24, respectively. The attenuation of α-ClFA migration on TLC compared with FA is likely because of the electron-withdrawing properties of the α-chlorine on the carbanion of the carboxylic group, thus reducing its pKa.FIGURE 3Temporal course of 2-ClHDA incorporation into HCAEC lipids.

We have recently developed a human tissue-engineered blood vessel comprising the three tunicae of a native blood vessel using the self-assembly approach. To investigate the role of the adventitia in the modulation of vascular tone, this tissue-engineering method was used to produce three vascular constructs from cells explanted and proliferated from donor vessel tunicae 1) an adventitia + a media, or only 2) an adventitia, or 3) a media. The vasoconstriction responses of these 3 constructs to endothelin, the most potent vasopressor known up-to-date, as well as to nonselective and selective agonists and antagonists, were compared. The adventitia contracted to endothelin-1, -2, whereas the media and the media+adventitia contracted to all three endothelins. Endothelin-induced contraction of the adventitia was dependent on ET(A) receptors, whereas that of the media and the adventitia+media was ET(A) and ET(B) receptor-dependent. RT-PCR studies corroborated these results. SNP induced a dose-dependent relaxation of the three tissue constructs. We also demonstrated that the endothelin-converting enzyme, responsible for the formation of the active endothelin peptides, was present and functional in the adventitia. In conclusion, this is the first direct demonstration that the adventitia has the capacity to contract and relax in response to vasoactive factors. The present study suggests that the adventitia of a blood vessel could play a greater role than expected in the modulation of blood vessel tone."

Although several actin regulatory systems have been implicated in cell-cell adhesion, it remains unclear how such systems drive cadherin-actin network formation and how they are regulated to coincide with initiation of adhesion. Previous work implicated VASP in assembly of cell-cell junctions in keratinocytes and the VASP-binding protein zyxin colocalizes with VASP at cell-cell junctions. Here we examine how domains in zyxin and its relative LPP contribute to cell-cell junction assembly. Using a quantitative assay for cell-cell adhesion, we demonstrate that zyxin and LPP function to increase the rate of early cell-cell junction assembly through the VASP-binding ActA repeat region. We also identify the LIM region of zyxin and LPP to be a regulatory domain that blocks function of these proteins. Deletion of the LIM domains drives adhesion and increases VASP level in detergent insoluble cadherin-actin. Dominant-negative zyxin/LPP mutants reduce the rate of adhesion, lower VASP levels in detergent-insoluble cadherin-actin networks, and allow for the accumulation of capping protein at cell-cell contacts.

Understanding actin assembly mechanisms has been greatly improved by studies of the intracellular pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (15Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 741-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Listeria ActA protein hijacks host actin polymerization machinery, directing assembly of actin comet tails that propel the bacterium through the cytosol (16Domann E. Wehland J. Rohde M. Pistor S.

In addition to actin nucleation by the Arp2/3 complex, normal motility requires the activity of VASP family members (18Chakraborty T. Ebel F. Domann E. Niebuhr K. Gerstel B. Pistor S. Temm-Grove C.J. Jockusch B.M. Reinhard M. Walter U. Wehland J.

Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that VASP competes with capping protein (CapZ) for available barbed ends of actin filaments, protecting the barbed end and allowing continued polymerization (20Bear J.E. Svitkina T.M. Krause M. Schafer D.A. Luoreiro J.J. Strasser G.A. Maly I.V. Chaga O.Y. Cooper J.A. Borisy G.G. Gertler F.B.

In such a model, local control of VASP concentration is critical in cellular regulation of actin organization. How cells control local VASP availability to regulate actin dynamics remains unclear. ActA repeats are observed in several mammalian proteins, including zyxin (21Drees B. Friedrich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard J. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and its close relative, LPP (22Petit M.M.R. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Menichi B.

Interestingly, zyxin and LPP are both present at cadherin-based cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells and tissues (13Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E.

Introduction of ActA repeats into cells displaces VASP, but not zyxin, from cell-substratum and cell-cell junctions (13Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar, 21Drees B. Friedrich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard J. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Expression of the tetramerization domain of VASP, which has been postulated to act as a VASP dominant-negative, in mouse skin results in defects in cell-cell adhesion that generate a skin blistering phenotype (13Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it has been predicted that zyxin recruits VASP to drive actin rearrangements observed during cell-cell junction assembly. Consistent with a role for zyxin in actin dynamics, membrane targeting of zyxin results in local actin assembly (21Drees B. Friedrich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard J. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Likewise, expression of zyxin fragments that target to mitochondria in cells induces local actin polymerization (25Fradelizi J. Noireaux V. Plastino J. Menichi B. Louvard D. Syked C. Golsteyn R.M. Friedrich E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, despite broad evidence for a role for zyxin in promoting actin dynamics, cell-cell junction organization appears normal in mice null for zyxin (24Hoffman L.M. Nix D.A. Benson B. Boot-Hanford R. Gustafsson E. Jamora C. Menzies A.S. Goh K.L. Jensen C.C. Gertler F.B. Fuchs E. Fassler R. Beckerle M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here the role of zyxin and LPP in cell-cell junction assembly is examined in detail in MDCK 2The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. cells. Results demonstrate that zyxin and LPP drive cell-cell adhesion through their arrays of ActA repeats. Expressing constitutively active mutants of zyxin or LPP drives rapid cell-cell adhesion and induces VASP incorporation into actin networks. Conversely, expressing dominant-negative mutants of zyxin or LPP slows cell-cell adhesion and prevents displacement of capping protein from cell-cell junctions. Expression of full-length zyxin or LPP does not affect adhesion. Deletion of the LIM region is required to elicit constitutive activity of zyxin or LPP, demonstrating that the LIM region of zyxin and LPP acts as a regulatory domain that prevents uncontrolled activation of the zyxin/LPP pathway. Together these results demonstrate a role for zyxin/LPP and VASP in cell-cell junction formation and suggest a novel mechanism for controlling VASP activity in cellular processes. Cell Culture—MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. Synchronous initiation of adhesion by a calcium switch was performed as described (4Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Quantitative measurement of the rate of cell-cell adhesion was performed as described (26Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and resuspended at 2.5 × 105 cells per ml. 20-μl drops of cell suspension were placed on the inner lid of a tissue culture plate, resulting in an inversion of the drop. Following 0–4-h incubation, cell aggregate sizes were determined either immediately or following trituration of the suspension. Cells were scored as part of small (1–10 cells), medium (11–50 cells), or large (>50 cells) aggregates of cells. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 6.0. To generate cell lines, MDCK cells were transfected using effectene reagent (Stratagene) with pDSred2.C1 or pEGFP.N2 plasmids containing zyxin or LPP sequence inserts, as generated by PCR. Following 14 days of G418 selection, expression of fusion proteins in the resistant cells was determined by Western blot analysis. Cells were extracted with 1% SDS, then the extract separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with anti-DSred2 or -GFP antibodies. Antibody binding was detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. A subpopulation of cells expressing DSred2 or GFP fusion protein was then isolated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The same collection parameters were selected for all cell lines. Analysis of cell-cell adhesion in cell lines was performed within two passages of sorting. Fluorescence—Cells grown on collagen-coated coverslips were washed with ice-cold Ringer's saline containing 1.8 mm CaCl2. Cells were extracted on ice in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100) for 10 min prior to fixation where appropriate. Cells were fixed on ice for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and 0.075% saponin and then stained with the appropriate primary antibodies. Antibodies used were cadherin, vinculin (Sigma), VASP (Transduction), capping protein α subunit, zyxin/LPP (B38), zyxin (B71), and LPP (MP2). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse or -rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 or -594. DSred2 or GFP fusion proteins were observed directly. All coverslips were mounted in VectaShield (Vector) and viewed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with 40× and 100× (both with a 1.30 numerical aperture) oil immersion objective lenses. Images were acquired using a Princeton Instruments RTE/CCD-1300-Y camera and Open-Lab software. Pairs of extracted and whole cells were imaged with identical exposure settings. Zyxin and LPP Localize to Cell-Cell Junctions in MDCK Cells—To explore the roles of zyxin and LPP in cell-cell junction assembly and strengthening we employed MDCK cells, a well established epithelial cell line that has been extensively used to study cadherin-based adhesion and is amenable to exogenous expression of recombinant proteins. To test whether antibodies raised against mammalian zyxin and/or LPP recognize the canine forms of these proteins, MDCK cell extracts were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to Western blot analysis with these antibodies. A single band of the appropriate molecular weight was observed when B38 (anti-zyxin and -LPP), B71 (anti-zyxin), and MP2 (anti-LPP) antibodies were used (Fig. 1A). Zyxin/LPP have been previously observed at cell-cell junctions of primary mouse keratinocytes using the B38 antibody (13Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). In MDCK cells, B38 antibody, as well as antibodies specific for either zyxin or LPP, stain cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1, B–D). Staining was most commonly observed in small colonies or at the edges of large colonies, where cell-cell junctions are less mature (data not shown). Zyxin was observed in specific actin-rich structures at early cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1, E–G). At higher resolution, zyxin staining resolved into two distinct regions, one at the end of each bundle of actin filaments that terminate at the same position within the cell-cell contact (Fig. 1, H–J). LPP also localizes to the ends of bundles of actin filaments that terminate at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1, K–M). These structures occur most commonly at the vertex, where multiple cells come into contact, and at sites at the edge of colonies where the cortical band of actin is joined at cell-cell contacts to form a continuous structure. Structures staining with zyxin and LPP antibodies are reminiscent of focal adhesions. However, radial bundles of actin that terminate in plaques of cadherin staining have also been described during the early stages of cell-cell contact formation in MDCK cells (11Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two types of structures, we tested whether focal and cadherin-based adhesion components would colocalize with zyxin at these sites. An intensely staining plaque of cadherin staining was observed to localize precisely between the two regions of zyxin staining (Fig. 1, N–P). Components of focal adhesions were also observed to colocalize precisely with zyxin in these actin-rich structures, namely VASP (Fig. 1, Q–S) and vinculin (Fig. 1, T–V). It should be noted that VASP and vinculin are known to target to cadherin-based adhesions in addition to focal adhesions and that VASP is a known binding partner of zyxin and LPP. In contrast, paxillin did not colocalize with zyxin at these cell-cell contact sites, even though paxillin and zyxin colocalize precisely at focal adhesions at the edge of colonies of MDCK cells (Fig. 1, W–Y). We conclude that bundles of actin filaments terminate at cell-cell junctions in dense plaques of cadherin, as described previously (11Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), and that zyxin, LPP, VASP, and vinculin localize to these structures. The dense cadherin plaque described by Adams et al. (11Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 12Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) could be analogous to structures observed in primary keratinocytes, where zyxin, VASP, and vinculin colocalize with cadherin at the tips of actin rich filopodia between contacting cells (13Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Expression of Zyxin and LPP Deletion Mutants in MDCK Cells—To define zyxin and LPP function in cell-cell adhesion, DSred2-zyxin and -LPP fusion proteins were designed and expressed in MDCK cells. Zyxin and LPP share organization of several key protein domains that were targeted for deletion from zyxin or LPP fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). These sites include an α-actinin binding site in the N-terminal 50 amino acids (27Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1381-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), a series of ActA repeats (four in zyxin, two in LPP) that have been demonstrated to bind the EVH1 domains of VASP family members (21Drees B.

Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J.M. Friedrich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and a series of three C-terminal LIM domains. MDCK cells were transfected with constructs encoding the depicted zyxin or LPP fusion proteins. Expression of fusion proteins tagged with DSred2 or EGFP was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cells were subjected to drug selection and a subpopulation of these cells was isolated using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter sorting allowed isolation of cell populations that express different DSred2 fusion proteins within a specific range of fluorescence intensity, eliminating the possibility of different deletion mutants generating distinct effects due to a variation in fusion protein expression. MDCK cells expressing zyxin or LPP fusion proteins were plated onto collagen-coated coverslips and the cell-cell junction localization of the protein fragments determined by direct DSred2 fluorescence. Importantly, DSred2 displayed a diffuse cytosolic distribution; specific targeting of the DSred2 protein to membrane sites, including cell-cell contacts, was not observed (Fig. 2B). In contrast, DSred2-zyxin (Fig. 2C) and -LPP (Fig. 2D) both exhibited some cell-cell junction localization when expressed in MDCK cells. When the α-actinin binding site, ActA repeats, or LIM domains were deleted from either zyxin or LPP, distinct localization patterns were observed (Fig. 2, E–J). Although strong localization in the cytosol and in the nucleus were observed for some fragments, it should be noted that varying levels of cell-cell junction staining was observed for every fragment tested. This junction staining did colocalize with the junction marker cadherin (data not shown). Involvement of the LIM Domain Region of Zyxin and LPP in Cell-Cell Adhesion—Cells expressing zyxin or LPP fusion proteins were then analyzed in a quantitative assay for cell-cell junction assembly and strengthening (26Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Kim A.S. Kakalis L.T. Abdul-Manan N. Liu G.A. Rosen M.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were placed in suspension culture and their ability to incorporate into aggregates measured as a function of time. Aggregates were also subjected to trituration forces that break weak cell-cell interactions, revealing the level of cell-cell junctions that have been strengthened. The average values from three experiments are presented here. To confirm that any observed differences in the rate of aggregate formation and strengthening were statistically relevant, multivariate logistical regression analysis was performed on the rate at which cells formed large aggregates. Based upon these data, a log-odds value (one half of the natural logarithm that a cell will be found in a large aggregate relative to the reference cell line, parental MDCK cells) was calculated for each cell line, both before and after trituration. A positive log-odds score indicates that it is more likely that a cell will be found in a large aggregate relative to the reference cell line, while a negative log-odds score indicates that it is less likely that a cell will be part of a large aggregate relative to the reference cell line. The log-odds value is computed with high fidelity, as indicated by p values that did not exceed 10–10 for any calculation. We established the following criteria for determining that a cell line demonstrates a statistically relevant difference in the rate of cell-cell junction formation. First, the two log-odds scores (for before and after trituration) must both be either positive or negative to be considered biologically relevant. Second, both log-odds scores for the cell line must exceed the error range (either positively or negatively), which we compute as double the standard error of the mean for all experiments. These values are 0.346763 and 0.358388 for before and after trituration scores, respectively. Using such stringent statistical criteria, any experimental variation is eliminated from consideration. Thus, for the adhesion assays, we present the raw count data for each cell line (Fig. 3, A–E), as well as log-odds calculations for cell lines in reference to parental MDCK cells (Fig. 3F). Parental MDCK cells (Fig. 3A) assemble into large aggregates (>50 cells) by 2 h, accounting for 68.1% of cells. After 3 and 4 h, large aggregates account for 85.2 and 92.2% of cells, respectively. Aggregation approaches maximum after 3 h in suspension, indicating that a plateau phase is reached. When cells are triturated prior to scoring, thus disrupting any weak cell-cell interactions, cells found in large aggregates after 2 h is reduced to 7.2%. Similarly, only 49.0 and 66.8% of parental cells are found in large aggregates after 3 and 4 h in suspension, respectively. Plateau phase for aggregation, as measured following trituration, is reached only by 4 h or later, demonstrating the occurrence of a lag between initial contact events and junction strengthening. MDCK cells expressing DSred2 fusion protein containing either full-length zyxin or LPP assemble and strengthen cell-cell junctions at a rate that does not significantly differ from parental MDCK cells (Fig. 3, B and F). Similarly, deletion of either the α-actinin binding sites or the ActA repeats from either full-length zyxin or full-length LPP resulted in no striking effect on the rate of cell-cell junction formation and strengthening according to our criteria (Fig. 3, C, D, and F). In contrast, expression of DSred2 fusion proteins containing either zyxin or LPP that lack the LIM domain region alters the rate of cell-cell contact assembly and strengthening to a degree that satisfies all statistical criteria (Fig. 3, E and F). Aggregation of both DSred2-zyxinΔLIM and DSred2-LPPΔLIM cells approaches maximum much earlier than the parental MDCK cells (Fig. 3E). After 2 h, large aggregates account for 92.2% of DSred2-zyxinΔLIM cells, compared with 68.1% of parental MDCK cells. Only 2.4% of DSred2-zyxinΔLIM cells occur in small aggregates (10 or fewer cells), compared with 17.4% of the parental cell line. Large aggregates account for 96.6% of DSred2-LPPΔLIM cells after 2 h, while small aggregates account for only 2.0%. The rate of strengthening initial cell-cell contacts is also very markedly increased in cell expressing DSred2-zyxinΔLIM or -LPPΔLIM. After 2 h in suspension, 77.1% of DSred2-zyxinΔLIM cells remain in large aggregates after trituration, compared with only 7.2% of parental MDCK cells. After 4 h, 96.3% of DSred2-zyxinΔLIM cells remain in large aggregates following trituration, compared with 66.8% of MDCK cells. Following trituration, large aggregates account for 92.8 and 80.5% of DSred2-LPPΔLIM cells after 2 and 4 h, respectively. Importantly, the rate of aggregation as measured before and after trituration is reached nearly simultaneously in these cell lines. Thus, a large percentage of cells in large aggregates have strengthened their cell-cell interactions sufficiently enough to withstand disruption by trituration. After 2 h in suspension, 83.6% of DSred2-zyxinΔLIM cells remain in large aggregates following trituration, compared with only 10.6% of parental MDCK cells. 96.1% of DSred2-LPPΔLIM cells remain in large aggregates following trituration after 2 h in suspension. Clearly the LIM region is critical for zyxin and LPP function in cell-cell adhesion. That the results observed can be accounted for by the DSred2 tag is unlikely. All of the fusion proteins contain the DSred2 tag and it is only by deletion of the LIM region that an effect is observed. Clearly the LIM region, and not the DSred2 tag, accounts for changes in cell-cell adhesion rates observed. We also observed that MDCK cells expressing GFP fusion proteins containing LIM domain deleted zyxin at high levels displayed an aberrant morphology, while those expressing a GFP fusion protein containing full-length zyxin at high levels did not. 3M. D. H. Hansen, unpublished results. This is consistent with the results observed with DSred2 fusion proteins: that deletion of the LIM domain unmasks the function of zyxin and LPP in cell-cell adhesion. Zyxin/LPP Localize to Sites of Early Cadherin-based Adhesion—Expression of either zyxin or LPP mutants lacking LIM domains results in faster aggregate formation and more immediate strengthening of cell-cell interactions within aggregates. Thus, both zyxin and LPP appear to function in early cell-cell contact formation. Given that zyxin and LPP mutants drive changes in cell-cell junction formation after 2 h of cell-cell contact in the adhesion assay, we sought to define how endogenous zyxin/LPP was distributed in MDCK cells relative to cadherin when cell-cell adhesion had been synchronously induced and allowed to proceed for 2 h. MDCK cells were maintained in culture at single cell density for 48 h and then seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips at confluent density in low calcium medium. Under this condition, cells are unable to convert cell-cell interactions into cadherin-based adhesions. Normal calcium levels are restored 3 h following plating in low calcium medium, resulting in"

CDO plays an important role in the formation of essential metabolites such as taurine and sulfate. Because cysteine is toxic at high levels (1Weinstein C.L. Haschemeyer R.H. Griffith O.W. J. Biol.

Because CDO is at a crucial branching point of cysteine catabolism, and several diseases have been linked to this metalloenzyme (6Perry T.L. Norman M.G. Yong V.W. Whiting S. Crichton J.U. Hansen S.

Many of the cysteine analogs utilized in our current work are metabolites that are present in mammalian cells, and their interaction with CDO could aid in unraveling thiol homeostasis and regulation.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—Cysteine, cysteine sulfinic acid, and heptafluorobutyric acid were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Sodium phosphate, sodium chloride, and ferrous sulfate were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Yeast extract, Tryptone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were obtained from Sigma.Overexpression, Purification, and Activity Measurement of the Recombinant CDO—BL21(D3)pLysS cells containing the pET-14b/CDO-ORF plasmid were grown in LB media at 22 °C, and the recombinant CDO was purified from the cells by immobilized nickel affinity chromatography as previously reported (9Chai S.C.

All assays were performed at pH 7.5 in 50 mm phosphate buffer. Gas chromatographic analysis with atomic emission detection was performed on derivatized samples using the procedure reported by Uden et al. (10Uden P.C. Boakye H.T. Kahakachchi C. Hafezi R.

The sulfhydryl-specific alkylating reagent iodoacetamide was removed by ultra-filtration followed by incubation of the enzyme with 30 mm cysteine for 4 h at 37 °C. The apo-CDO was reconstituted with ferrous ammonium sulfate prior incubation with the substrate, as previously described (9Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I. Pinkham J.L. Uden P.C.

A fraction of the purified enzyme was incubated with 5.3 mm cysteine under anaerobic condition in a Coy chamber, which is approximately the concentration needed to reach Vmax. The samples were contained in polycarbonate holders that were inserted into a slotted aluminum holder and held near 50 K using a helium displex cryostat. The XAS data were collected under dedicated conditions at ∼2.8 GeV and 160–260 mA as previously described (11Bagyinka C. Whitehead J.P. Maroney M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3576-3585Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), except that a sagittally focusing Si(111) double-crystal monochromator was used for these studies. The x-ray energy of the focused monochromatic beam was internally calibrated to the first inflection point of iron foil (7112.0 eV).X-ray fluorescence data were collected using a 13-element germanium detector (Canberra) over the range from ∼6.9 to 8.1 KeV, with the vertical primary aperture of 1.0 mm. Harmonic rejection was achieved by use of a nickel focusing mirror left flat. An average of 15 scans for resting CDO and 19 scans for the CDO ES complex was used for EXAFS analysis. The summed, energy-calibrated data files were background-corrected using two third-order polynomial fits and normalized. Single-scattering EXAFS arising from atoms in the first coordination shell of the iron was analyzed using WinXAS (12Ressler T. J. Phys. IV. 1997; 7: 269-270Google Scholar) according to standard procedures (13Davidson G. Clugston S.L. Honek J.F. Maroney M.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4569-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Theoretical phases and amplitudes for EXAFS analyses were obtained from FEFF 8.2 calculations of crystallographic characterized model compounds, (Et4N)2[Fe(p-SC6H4CH3)4] (14Kang B. Cai J. Jiegou Huaxue. 1985; 4: 119-122Google Scholar) and catena-(hexakis(μ-2-imidazoyl-N,N′)bis(imidazole) tri-iron) (15Lehnert R. Seel F. Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 1978; 444: 91-96Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Integer values for the number of scattering atoms in a shell were used in the fits without refinement. This led to the following running parameters for each shell in the first coordination sphere: the distance (r), the disorder parameter (σ2), and phase shift parameter (ΔE0). Models incorporating histidine imidazole ligands were used to fit data due to scattering from atoms in the second and third coordination spheres. These models used imidazole parameters, including multiple scattering pathways contributing >20% intensity that were calculated using FEFF 8.2, as previously described (13Davidson G. Clugston S.L.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 128: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, kinetic studies of the inhibition of the enzyme with molecules structurally analogous to the substrate can provide insights into the requirements for substrate binding (Scheme 1). The effect of cysteine analogs on CDO activity was assessed using an in vitro assay that monitors cysteine sulfinic acid formation from cysteine in the presence of varying concentrations of cysteine analogs, where 100% activity is described as CDO activity in the absence of the analogs tested.Our initial characterization of recombinant CDO showed that the enzyme is inhibited by homocysteine but not by methionine (9Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I. Pinkham J.L. Uden P.C. Maroney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9865-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assays with homocysteine indicated that alkyl chain extension by the addition of an extra methylene in the backbone does not prevent binding to the active site. However, the terminal methyl group attached to the sulfhydryl prevents inhibition by methionine. Studies with S-methylcysteine (data not shown) also show no inhibition, as in the case with methionine. On the other hand, S-carboxymethylcysteine (addition of a terminal carboxylate group) exhibited 50% inhibition at a concentration of 2.3 mm (Fig. 1A).FIGURE 1A, CDO inhibition by S-carboxymethylcysteine. Five samples containing 0.024 mg/ml CDO and 3.7 mm cysteine were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with either 0, 0.4, 1.0, 5.9, or 11.8 mm S-carboxymethylcysteine. B, CDO inhibition by aspartic acid. Five samples containing 0.026 mg/ml CDO and 3.7 mm cysteine were incubated with varying concentrations of aspartic acid (0, 0.5, 1.0, 6.1, or 12.2 mm, respectively) at 37 °C for 3 h. C, CDO inhibition by α-ketoglutarate. 0.5 mg/ml CDO and 21 mm cysteine were incubated in the presence of either 0, 1.7, 5.0, 13.5, and 26.9 mm α-ketoglutarate. These five samples were left in a water bath at 37 °C for 4 h. In all three experiments, the reaction was terminated by addition of heptafluorobutyric acid prior to analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The studies reported above indicated that a charged side chain was required for inhibitor binding and that a sulfhydryl might not be required for inhibition of the enzyme. This was confirmed in studies using aspartic acid, which decreases enzyme activity by half at a concentration of 1.5 mm (Fig. 1B). However, replacing the sulfhydryl by the uncharged hydroxyl group of serine did not affect enzyme activity (data not shown).The inhibition of CDO by aspartate ion suggested that the enzyme might be inhibited by α-ketoglutarate, which is a common cofactor for non-heme iron dioxygenases (16Costas M. Mehn M.P. Jensen M.P. Que L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 939-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). In fact, α-ketoglutarate was found to inhibit CDO with 50% inhibition at 6.8 mm (Fig. 1C).We also examined the importance of the functional groups at the α-carbon of the amino acid. Mercaptopropionic acid is a cysteine analog lacking the amine group, and at a concentration of 1.2 mm inhibited CDO activity by 50% (Fig. 2A). Cysteamine (2-aminoethanethiol) is synthesized in mammalian tissues from pantetheine (17Novelli G.D. Schmetz F.J. Kaplan N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 206: 533-545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to mercaptopropionic acid, it was surprising to discover that cysteamine enhances the activity of recombinant significantly (Fig. 2B). At a reaction time of 45 min, CDO activity increases almost 20 times in the presence of 5.8 mm cysteamine. Cysteamine is not an alternative substrate for the enzyme, because cysteine sulfinic acid can be detected by the assay when similar concentrations of cysteine and cysteamine are present. Furthermore, no oxidation product of cysteamine was detected by the reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method or by gas chromatography analysis with an atomic emission detector. In fact, we did not observe product formation on any of the cysteine analogs tested, including d-cysteine (data not shown).FIGURE 2A, CDO inhibition by mercaptopropionic acid. Five samples were prepared containing 0.038 mg/ml CDO and 2.5 mm cysteine with increasing concentrations of mercaptopropionic acid (0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2.4, and 4.7 mm, respectively). The five samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. B, CDO activity in the presence of cysteamine. Five samples containing 0.028 mg/ml CDO, 6.4 mm cysteine, and varying concentrations of cysteamine (0, 0.7, 1.5, 2.9, 3.9, and 5.9 mm) were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (250 μl) were taken from each of the five samples at 45, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 210 min. Heptafluorobutyric acid was added to terminate the reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observation that cysteamine is an activator of CDO but not a substrate suggested a possible redox role. The possibility that an active site sulfhydryl group might be oxidized to a disulfide, but could be reduced by cysteamine, was an attractive possibility given the literature on the activity of the enzyme with preincubation with cysteine (18Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, CDO treated with the sulfhydryl-binding agent iodoacetamide had no effect on the enzyme activity. The same result was obtained by incubating apo-CDO with iodoacetamide after removal of the reagent and reconstitution with iron. We conclude that there is no essential sulfhydryl group in the active site.CDO is a metalloenzyme that requires ferrous ion to be active (18Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi K. Hosokawa Y. Kohashi N. Ueda I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 422: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We also investigated the inhibition of recombinant CDO using metal-binding anions. Azide (Fig. 3A) and cyanide (Fig. 3B), also inhibit CDO with a 50% activity reduction at 1.4 and 2.7 mm, respectively, suggesting that these anions bind to the active site iron.FIGURE 3A, CDO inhibition by azide. Five samples were prepared containing 0.015 mg/ml CDO and 5.8 mm cysteine with varying concentrations of azide (0, 0.5, 1.0, 6.1, and 12.2 mm, respectively). The five samples were left at 37 °C for 3 h. B, CDO inhibition by cyanide. 0.4 mg/ml CDO and 5.9 mm cysteine were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 0, 0.6, 1.5, 4.1, or 8.3 mm cyanide. Heptafluorobutyric acid was added to terminate the reaction in both experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)X-ray absorption spectroscopy was employed to examine the interaction of the iron center with cysteine. The data obtained are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4. X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis shows that the iron K-edge 3K-edge is defined as follows: The “K” stands for the K shell of the Bohr atom (or the 1 s orbital). “Edge” is the word given for the sharp rise in x-ray absorbance that occurs when one irradiates an element at the binding energy of a particular electron. Thus, the K-edge corresponds to the sharp rise in x-ray absorbance that occurs at the energy level where a 1 s electron is ejected. occurs at 7123.1 and 7121.2 eV in the resting and substrate-bound enzyme. The pre-edge feature assigned to a 1s → 3d transition has an area of 9.0 × 10–2 eV in the resting enzyme and 8.1 × 10–2 eV in the oxidized enzyme, indicating that both contain six coordinate iron atoms (19Roe A.L. Schneider D.J. Mayer R.J. Pyrz J.W. Widom J. Que L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 1676-1681Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The results of EXAFS analysis of the first coordination sphere show that the ligand environment of the resting enzyme is composed of six N/O-donor ligands. Upon binding substrate, the structure of the iron site is perturbed but is still consistent with six O/N donors, indicating that cysteine may bind to the iron center, but is not bound via the sulfur atom. Models incorporating histidine imidazole ring atoms showed that the data are consistent with the presence of two or three histidine ligands.TABLE 1Selected fits of iron K-edge EXAFS data for resting CDO and ES complexSample/fit no.Nrs2ΔE0ResidualÄ×103 Ä2%Resting R016Fe-N/O = 2.04113.439.3 R023Fe-N/O = 2.116.47.036.63Fe-N/O = 1.946.4-4.8 R035Fe-N/O = 2.079.76.233.51Fe-S = 1.936.9-53 R042Fe-N/O = 2.182.68.430.12Fe-N/O = 2.030.46.12Fe-N/O = 1.854.0-20 R053Fe-N/O = 2.060.66.133.32Fe-N/O = 1.901.8-7.21Fe-S = 2.282.3-22 R063Fe-N/O = 1.887.7-2125.43Fe-N/O = 2.086.96.7Fe-C = 2.90233.5Fe-C/N = 4.08119.0ES Complex ES016Fe-N/O = 2.12125.743.0 ES023Fe-N/O = 2.215.56.539.83Fe-N/O = 2.064.75.5 ES035Fe-N/O = 2.14116.940.51Fe-S = 2.0110-59 ES042Fe-N/O = 2.234.27.738.82Fe-N/O = 2.041.64.71Fe-N/O = 2.160.47.0 ES051Fe-N/O = 2.180.27.943.32Fe-N/O = 2.051.45.01Fe-S = 2.316.9-14 E5063Fe-N/O = 2.043.33.528.23Fe-N/O = 2.173.0-3.1Fe-C = 2.988.83.4Fe-C/N = 4.24124.6 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 4Iron K-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure of the resting (dashed line) and the ES complex (solid line) of CDO.

This negative charge may be supplied by a thiolate, as in the substrate l-cysteine or the inhibitor, homocysteine, or by a carboxylate, as in S-carboxymethylcysteine, aspartic acid, and α-ketoglutarate. Analogs having an uncharged side chain, such as serine or the methylthioethers of cysteine or homocysteine, have no effect on the enzyme activity.S-Carboxymethylcysteine is a mucoactive drug used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20Brown D.T. Drug Intel. Clin. Phar. 1988; 22: 603-608PubMed Google Scholar). Even though initially speculated that CDO might be responsible for the S-oxidation of S-carboxymethylcysteine (21Khan S. Mitchell S.C. Steventon G.B. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2004; 56: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it is noteworthy to consider the effects of this drug on cysteine metabolism due to its interaction with CDO.Additional support for the essentiality of an anionic side chain came from kinetic studies of CDO in the presence of α-ketoglutarate. There are several non-heme iron dioxygenases that make use of α-ketoglutarate as an essential cofactor (16Costas M. Mehn M.P. Jensen M.P. Que L. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 939-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar, 22Ryle M.J. Hausinger R.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These oxygenases are classified as intermolecular dioxygenases, because one of the oxygen atoms of dioxygen is inserted into the substrate, whereas the α-keto acid acts as the second oxygen acceptor. CDO is clearly not a member of this group of enzymes, because CDO incorporates both oxygen atoms in the substrate (23Lombardini J.B. Singer T.P. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1172-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, CDO is the first known dioxygenase that has been shown to be inhibited by α-ketoglutarate. This inhibition fits with the other inhibitors in that α-ketoglutarate is an amino acid with a negatively charged side chain.The iron center plays an essential role in catalysis. Previously we have studied enzyme deactivation by the chelating agents EDTA and o-phenanthroline (9Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I. Pinkham J.L. Uden P.C. Maroney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9865-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our current work illustrates enzyme deactivation by binding of azide or cyanide, anions that typically bind to metals. One possible mechanism that accounts for the requirement that the substrate have an anionic side chain is that the anionic side chain is involved in binding to the active site iron center. The interaction of cysteine with the active site iron was addressed using XAS. This experiment suffered from the facts that the enzyme does not bind iron tightly, cannot be purified from iron-containing solutions, and cannot retain more than 10% of stoichiometric iron (9Chai S.C. Jerkins A.A. Banik J.J. Shalev I. Pinkham J.L. Uden P.C. Maroney M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9865-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, information regarding the structure of the primary coordination sphere of the iron could be obtained from analysis of the XAS arising from the iron that was bound to the enzyme following removal of unbound and nonspecifically bound iron with Chelex.Fits of the EXAFS arising from the iron center in the resting enzyme are consistent with six O- or N-donors bound to the iron at an average distance of 2.04 Ä (Table 1, fit R01). Separating the single shell of scattering atoms into two shells at 2.11 Ä and 1.94 Ä gives a modest improvement in the fit (Table 1, fit R02). More improvement in the fit can be obtained by incorporating scattering atoms at three different distances (2.18 Ä, 2.03 Ä, and 1.85 Ä) (Table 1, fit R04), although the shift in E0 for the shortest distance is rather large. Attempts to incorporate an S-donor ligand in the fits led to unreasonably large shifts in E0, unrealistically short Fe–S distances, or poorer fits compared with those with an equivalent number of shell but lacking S-donors (Table 1, fits R03 and R05). Thus, there is no evidence to support S-coordination in the resting enzyme.The fits obtained from the ES complex are also consistent with a six-coordinate iron center with only O- or N-donors in the primary coordination sphere. A single shell fit (Table 1, fit ES01) gives an average Fe-O/N distance of 2.12 Ä. Splitting the single shell of scattering atoms into two shells at 2.21 Ä and 2.06 Ä gives a modest improvement in the fit (Table 1, fit ES02). Incorporation of three shells of O- or N-donors does not significantly improve the fit (Table 1, fit ES04). The distances obtained for the ES complex are longer than those obtained for the resting enzyme, showing that the iron site is perturbed by substrate binding. The data are consistent with binding of cysteine to the iron center via the carboxylate group, but because there is no change in coordination number or donor-atom set, the data are also consistent with a binding site close to the metal that changes the M-L distances. However, incorporation of an S-donor ligand into any fit leads to poorer residuals compared with fits with the same number of shells but lacking S-donors. Thus, there is no evidence to support that the cysteine is bound to the iron via the sulfur atom. Another difference between the EXAFS data from the resting enzyme and the ES complex is the intensity of features near 2.3 Ä (uncorrected for phase shift) in the Fourier-transformed spectra. Whereas this might indicate the presence of a long Fe–S distance (∼2.7 Ä), no fits with a long Fe–S bond were obtained.The crystal structure of cysteine dioxygenase from Mus musculus was recently obtained (PDB code 2ATF), with a bound nickel ion instead of a non-heme ferrous ion (24McCoy J.G. Bailey L.J. Bitto E. Bingman C.A. Aceti D.J. Fox B.G. Phillips G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3084-3089Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The structure indicates a nickel center formed by three histidine ligands and three solvent-derived ligands. Our XAS data from the resting state CDO are consistent with three N-donor ligands and three O-donor ligands at typical Fe-aqua distances. Although the data do not show a significant peak in the Fourier-transformed spectra near 4 Ä that is typical of coordinated histidine imidazole side chains, the data are not inconsistent with histidine coordination. Models incorporating imidazole rings show that the features near 2.3 Ä in the Fourier-transformed ES spectrum can be accounted for by three histidine ligands (Table 1, fit ES06, and Fig. 4). Similarly, incorporation of three histidine ligands in the model for the resting enzyme also leads to a successful fit of the data. The smaller intensity of the features arising from the imidazole ligands in the resting enzyme result in a larger value of σ2, suggesting that the intensity differences between the two sets of data are due to greater disorder in the resting enzyme iron site (Table 1, fit R06, and Fig. 4). We conclude that the iron site in CDO is consistent with the crystal structure reported for the nickel-substituted enzyme.None of the substrate derivatives tested gave any indication of product formation. However, the fact that l-cysteine is the only known substrate that undergoes oxidation suggests that a specific enzyme-substrate geometry at the active site is required for the oxidative chemistry to occur. According to our observations, d-cysteine was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor, suggesting the importance of the chirality at the α-carbon for active site binding. One possibility is that the geometry and distances between the sulfur atom of cysteine, the ferrous center, and oxygen are crucial. The data are consistent with a model where the cysteine binds at or near the iron center in a way that positions the sulfur atom near to where the oxygen molecule binds to the ferrous center. Perturbations in the EXAFS spectrum are consistent with substrate binding to iron via a N/O-donor atom. Such binding could be used to position the sulfur atom of cysteine. Inhibition by aspartate would result from the replacement of the S-atom, whereas inhibition by homocysteine would result from misplacement of the sulfur atom due to the longer side chain (Scheme 2).

https://openalex.org/W2061100764,"Fibrillar collagens have an absolute requirement for Gly as every 3rd residue, whereas breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern are found normally in the triple helix domains of non-fibrillar collagens, such as type IV collagen in basement membranes. In this study, a model 30-mer peptide is designed to include the interruption GPOGAAVMGPOGPO found in the α5 chain of type IV collagen. The GAAVM peptide forms a stable triple helix, with Tm = 29 °C. When compared with a control peptide with Gly as every 3rd residue, the GAAVM peptide has a marked decrease in the 225 nm maximum of its CD spectrum and a 10 °C drop in stability. A 50% decrease in calorimetric enthalpy is observed, which may result from disruption of ordered water structure anchored by regularly placed backbone carbonyls. NMR studies on specific 15N-labeled residues within the GAAVM peptide indicate a normal triple helical structure for Gly-Pro-Hyp residues flanking the break. The sequence within the break is not disordered but shows altered hydrogen exchange rates and an abnormal Val chemical shift. It was previously reported that a peptide designed to model a similar kind of interruption in the peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, (GPOGPOPOGPO), is unable to form a stable triple helix, and replacement of GAA by GPO or VM by PO within the GAAVM break decreases the stability. Thus, rigid imino acids are unfavorable within a break, despite their favorable stabilization of the triple helix itself. These results suggest some non-random structure typical of this category of breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeat of the triple helix. Fibrillar collagens have an absolute requirement for Gly as every 3rd residue, whereas breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern are found normally in the triple helix domains of non-fibrillar collagens, such as type IV collagen in basement membranes. In this study, a model 30-mer peptide is designed to include the interruption GPOGAAVMGPOGPO found in the α5 chain of type IV collagen. The GAAVM peptide forms a stable triple helix, with Tm = 29 °C. When compared with a control peptide with Gly as every 3rd residue, the GAAVM peptide has a marked decrease in the 225 nm maximum of its CD spectrum and a 10 °C drop in stability. A 50% decrease in calorimetric enthalpy is observed, which may result from disruption of ordered water structure anchored by regularly placed backbone carbonyls. NMR studies on specific 15N-labeled residues within the GAAVM peptide indicate a normal triple helical structure for Gly-Pro-Hyp residues flanking the break. The sequence within the break is not disordered but shows altered hydrogen exchange rates and an abnormal Val chemical shift. It was previously reported that a peptide designed to model a similar kind of interruption in the peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10, (GPOGPOPOGPO), is unable to form a stable triple helix, and replacement of GAA by GPO or VM by PO within the GAAVM break decreases the stability. Thus, rigid imino acids are unfavorable within a break, despite their favorable stabilization of the triple helix itself. These results suggest some non-random structure typical of this category of breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeat of the triple helix. The repeating (Gly-X-Y)n sequence of the collagen triple helix allows for easy identification of this structural motif from amino acid sequences. The collagen triple helix structure consists of three supercoiled polypeptide chains, each in a polyproline II-like conformation (1Ramachandran G.N. Kartha G. Nature. 1955; 176: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Rich A. Crick F.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 483-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 3Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B.

The repeating pattern of Gly as every 3rd residue is generated by steric requirements of the close packing of the three supercoiled polypeptide chains near a central axis. The collagen amino acid sequence is also characterized by a high frequency of proline and hydroxyproline (Hyp 4The abbreviations used are: Hyp, hydroxyproline; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; deg, degrees. 4The abbreviations used are: Hyp, hydroxyproline; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; deg, degrees.) in the X and Y positions, respectively, which serves to stabilize the polyproline II-like helix of the individual chains. The collagen triple helix is the defining motif of all extracellular matrix proteins classified as collagens and is also found as a domain in various other proteins, including C1q, macrophage scavenger receptor, collagenous tail of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase, and the bacterial proteins Streptococcus pyogenes scl and Bacillus anthraces bcl1 (5Hoppe H.J.

Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspect. 2002; (Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York): 159-222Crossref Google Scholar). Although the (Gly-X-Y)n repeating sequence is a requirement to form a collagen triple helix, this pattern is perfectly maintained in some collagen domains but not in others (9Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspect. 2002; (Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York): 159-222Crossref Google Scholar). The most abundant collagens are those found in fibrils with a 670 Å axial period (types I, II, III, V, XI), and these all maintain a precise Gly-X-Y repeat throughout their ∼1000-residue triple helix domain. The replacement of even one Gly by another residue as a result of a single base change results in a pathological condition (10Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). For instance, missense mutations leading to osteogenesis imperfecta have been identified at more than 200 Gly sites along the α1 and α2 chains of type I collagen (13Byers P.H. Cole W.G. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspect. 2002; (Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York): 385-430Crossref Google Scholar). However, such a strict regularity of Gly as every 3rd residue throughout the triple helix domain is not required in non-fibrillar collagens, which may be found as membrane proteins, on the surface of periodic collagen fibrils, as networks, or in anchoring fibrils (9Kielty C.M. Grant M.E. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders Molecular, Genetic, and Medical Aspect. 2002; (Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York): 159-222Crossref Google Scholar). For instance, type IV collagen, which forms a network-like array in basement membranes, contains more than 20 breaks in the (Gly-X-Y)n pattern of its ∼1350-residue long triple helix (14Zhou J. Hertz J.M. Leinonen A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hudson B.G. Tryggvason K. Sundaramoorthy M. Neilson E.G. N. Engl. J.

Biochem. 1987; 168: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These normal interruptions found in non-fibrillar collagens may play a role in molecular structure, self-association within the network, or binding (17Yurchenco P.D. Ruben G.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 132: 278-291PubMed Google Scholar). A number of possible structural perturbations have been proposed to occur at interruptions in the Gly-X-Y repeating pattern of a triple helix. A kink in the triple helix is known to occur in C1q at a site where the A chain has an extra Thr, the C chain has a Gly-to-Ala replacement, and the B chain has an uninterrupted Gly-X-Y sequence (18Kilchherr E. Hofmann H. Steigemann W. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Brodsky-Doyle B. Leonard K.R. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an interruption could lead to a flexible site within the triple helix (16Brazel D. Oberbaumer I. Dieringer H. Babel W. Glanville R.W. Deutzmann R. Kuhn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Hofmann H. Voss T. Kuhn K. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 325-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Visualization of type IV collagen chains by rotary shadowing shows some flexible sites, and the positions of flexible sites within the molecule correlate with several sequence interruptions. Two crystal structures were solved for the homotrimeric model peptide (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 containing an interruption. Peptides containing either a Gly-to-Ala replacement (3Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) or a deletion of one Hyp residue 5J. Bella, J. Liu, and H. M. Berman, personal communication. 5J. Bella, J. Liu, and H. M. Berman, personal communication. show straight rod-like triple helices but with a loss of angular or axial register at the interruption site. In addition to affecting molecular and higher order structure, breaks in the (Gly-X-Y)n pattern can also serve as interaction sites of biological importance. For example, the sequence of the α1 chain of type IV collagen contains a break GAKGEPGEFYFDLRLKGDKGDP, which was shown to promote the adhesion of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and Jurkat cells (21Miles A.J. Skubitz A.P. Furcht L.T. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30939-30945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Furcht L.T. Skubitz A.P. Fields G.B. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 781-783PubMed Google Scholar). In the mannose-binding protein, the serine proteinases are shown to bind near a kink in the triple helix domain (23Wallis R. Shaw J.M. Uitdehaag J. Chen C.B. Torgersen D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14065-14073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A kink, flexible site, or loss of loss of helix registration would introduce a structurally distinct site that could be involved in recognition. Structural and functional consequences could be influenced by the nature of the break and by the sequence of surrounding residues (24Long C.G. Thomas M. Brodsky B. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Breaks can be classified by the way in which they interrupt the Gly-X-Y pattern. In many cases, the presence of Gly as every 3rd residue is altered such that glycines are separated by 1 or 4 residues, rather than the normal 2 residues, whereas in other cases, there are larger stretches of non-repeating residues separating Gly-X-Y repeats. It has been suggested that the Gly-X-Y residues surrounding breaks have some characteristic features with respect to charges and imino acids (24Long C.G. Thomas M. Brodsky B. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Peptide models provide an approach to characterizing the effects of breaks on triple helix structure and stability (3Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 25Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Baum J. Brodsky B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here, studies are presented on a peptide that models a break in the triple helix found in a chain of type IV collagen. Type IV collagen is a family of six chains, α1(IV), α2(IV), α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV), which can form three distinct heterotrimeric collagen molecules with tissue-specific locations: (α1(IV))2α2(IV) in all mammalian basement membranes; α3(IV)α4(IV)α5(IV) in renal glomerular basement membrane; and (α5(IV))2α6(IV) in smooth muscle basement membrane (27Borza D.B. Bondar O. Ninomiya Y. Sado Y. Naito I. Todd P. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28532-28540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Each molecule has a long triple helix domain, with a globular C terminus involved in chain selection and dimerization of molecules. There are over 20 breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeat of each type IV chain (14Zhou J. Hertz J.M. Leinonen A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the presence of these interruptions in native type IV collagen, an additional break due to the replacement of one Gly residue in the Gly-X-Y repeat is not tolerated. More than 150 mutations leading to Alport syndrome have been defined within the X-linked α5(IV) chain, and these are predominantly single base mutations replacing one Gly by another residue (15Hudson B.G. Tryggvason K. Sundaramoorthy M. Neilson E.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2543-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 28Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Mutat. 1997; 9: 477-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Studies are presented here on a homotrimer peptide model for a natural break found in the α5(IV) chain of type IV collagen, GPOGAAVMGPOGPO (residues 386-399) and a set of homologous peptides with imino acids introduced within the break. A peptide in which the Gly as every 3rd residue is restored was designed as a control. CD spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and NMR studies indicated that the GAAVM break is successfully incorporated within a stable triple helical structure, and information was obtained concerning the energetics and conformation within the break. Peptides—Peptides are denoted by the single amino acid code for the residues surrounded by Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets. In this notation, Hyp is denoted as O. Peptides GAAVM, GAAGVM, GAAPO, GPOVM, GPOPO, and GPGPO were synthesized by Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). The peptides include a Tyr at the C terminus, and the concentration was determined using the molar extinction coefficient 1400 (M-1cm-1) at 275 nm on a Beckman model DU640 spectrophotometer. Peptides were purified on a Shimadzu reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system, and the identity of the peptides was confirmed by laser desorption mass spectrometry. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter. Cuvettes of 1- and 0.2-mm path lengths were used, and the temperature of the cells was controlled using a Peltier temperature controller. Samples were prepared at different concentrations in either phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7, or 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.2, and equilibrated at 0 °C for at least 48 h prior to recording spectra. Wavelength scans were collected in 0.5-nm steps with 4-s averaging time and repeated three times. For temperature-induced denaturation, the ellipticity was monitored at 225 nm. The peptides were equilibrated for 2 min at each temperature, and the temperature was increased at an average rate of 0.1 °C/min. The melting curves are obtained under standard conditions used in our laboratory for comparison, although equilibrium is not fully reached (30Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The Tm was determined as the temperature at which the fraction folded is equal to 0.5 in a trimer-to-monomer transition that was fit to the experimental curve. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC transition curves were recorded on a NANO-DSC II model 6100 (Calorimetry Sciences Corp.) calorimeter. Samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl), pH 7, and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.2, respectively, before each run. Samples were equilibrated at 0 °C for at least 48 h prior to recording the melting curves. The melting transition curves were monitored at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. Since this heating rate gives a scan that is far from equilibrium (30Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the denaturation temperature Tm observed is scan rate-dependent and higher than that observed for CD studies done at slower rates. The enthalpy was calculated from the first scan since the scans were not reversible upon cooling. Enthalpy measurements under these conditions should be valid since it was shown for similar collagenous peptides that the calorimetric enthalpy determined by DSC is independent of the heating rate (30Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Two GAAVM peptides of identical sequence were synthesized with 15N amino acids labeled at different positions to optimize NMR assignments. One peptide is selectively 15N-labeled at positions Gly-13, Ala-15, Gly-24, whereas a second peptide is labeled at positions Gly-7, Gly-13, Ala-14, and Val-16. Samples for both peptides were prepared in 10% D2O/90% H2O at pH 1.9 with concentrations of 5.3-5.6 mm. NMR experiments were performed on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer. 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) at 0 °C and three-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC-TOCSY experiments at 25 °C with a mixing time of 45 ms were carried out for assignment of NMR resonances. All data were processed on a Silicon Graphics work station using the FELIX 2004 software package (MSI, San Diego, CA). HSQC spectra of GAAVM peptides 1 and 2 were overlaid using NMRView (31Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Hydrogen exchange experiments were carried out at 10 °C, pD 2.5-2.6, where the pD includes the correction for the glass electrode solvent isotope artifact (32Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-189Crossref Scopus (2126) Google Scholar). The sample was equilibrated in H2O at 10 °C for a minimum of 72 h to ensure that the monomer-trimer interconversion had reached equilibrium. The sample was then lyophilized and dissolved in D2O. The HSQC spectra were acquired with a 5-min acquisition time for the first 14 spectra and a 44-min acquisition time for the following spectra to allow the measurements of both fast- and slow-exchanging amide protons. Peak volumes were measured as a function of time. The volumes were normalized by the integration of the non-exchangeable resonance of DSS in one-dimensional spectra collected before and after the HSQC experiments. The hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates were single exponential with a non-zero asymptote I∞ in the equation I(t)=(I0−I∞)exp(−kex∗t)+I∞ The error in kex was the fitting error from the variance-covariance matrix. The protection factors (P) were calculated by the equation P=kint/kex where kint is the theoretical monomer exchange rate for the amide proton at a specific pH and temperature (33Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The error in the intrinsic rate was estimated by assuming an experimental uncertainty of ±0.2 °C and ±0.1 pH units. The error in the protection factor σP was then calculated using the equation σP=P∗(σkex/kex)2+(σkint/kint)2 where σkex is the error in the measured exchange rate and σkint is the error in the intrinsic rate. Statistical Analyses of Amino Acids within Breaks—The χ2 test of statistical significance at a level of p < 0.001 was applied to test whether amino acids within the Gly-AA1-AA2-AA3-AA4-Gly breaks differ from amino acids in the X- and Y-position of the triple helical region. Since the number of Gly-AA1-AA2-AA3-AA4-Gly breaks in all type IV chains is only 28, the amino acids were grouped in categories as follows: hydrophobic residues, Ile, Leu, Met, Val; small residues, Ala, Cys, Gly, Ser; charged residues, Asp, Glu, His, Lys, Arg; imino acid, Pro; aromatic residues, Phe, Trp, Tyr; and polar residues, Asn, Gln, Thr. Peptide Design—In the α5 chain of human type IV collagen, there are 22 breaks in the Gly-X-Y repeating sequence distributed all along the triple helix (14Zhou J. Hertz J.M. Leinonen A. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A set of peptides was synthesized to investigate one of these naturally occurring breaks, by incorporating the sequence GPOGAAVMGPOGPO (residues 386-399) into a peptide model. Additional Gly-Pro-Hyp sequences were added on each side to ensure stability and to create a 30-mer peptide that could be compared with earlier peptides of this length (3Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B.

All peptides in this study are designated by the single-letter code for the central sequence, which is flanked by Gly-Pro-Hyp units, so this peptide is labeled the GAAVM peptide (Table 1). Two peptides were synthesized with this sequence, with 15N-Gly, 15N-Ala, or 15N-Val at various positions, so that residue-specific NMR assignments could be made.TABLE 1Thermal stability, mean residue ellipticity, and calorimetric enthalpy of peptide modeling a natural break in the α5 chain of type IV collagen and a control peptide with an artificial Gly insertion Peptides were both blocked at the termini and were characterized in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml.PeptideSequenceTm[Θ]225 nmΔHcal°Cdegrees cm2 dmol–1kJ/molGAAVMAc-(GPO)4 GAAVM(GPO)4-CONH229.1 ± 0.52360188 ± 4GAAGVMAc-(GPO)4 GAAGVM(GPO)4-CONH239.7 ± 0.54950354 ± 8 Open table in a new tab CD Spectroscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry of the GAAVM and GAAGVM Peptides—The peptide including the native GPOGAAVMGPOGPO sequence was found to form a structure with a substantial amount of triple helix. The GAAVM peptide has a CD spectrum with a maximum at 225 nm (MRE225 nm = 2360 deg cm2/dmol) and a minimum at 198 nm (MRE198 nm = -33866 deg cm2/dmol). This spectrum is characteristic of the collagen triple helix. Monitoring the ellipticity at 225 nm as a function of temperature showed a cooperative thermal transition with a Tm value of 29.1 °C (Fig. 2). As shown below, NMR studies support a trimeric nature throughout this peptide at low temperature, suggesting that this is a trimer-to-monomer transition (see Fig. 5).FIGURE 5HSQC spectra and hydrogen exchange studies of the GAAVM paptide. A, overlaid 1H-15N HSQC spectra of two GAAVM peptides, each labeled at different positions as indicated in the given sequences in red in one peptide and blue in the other peptide at 0 °C.

B, histogram of hydrogen/deuterium protection factors for the labeled residues in both GAAVM peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the consequences of the interruption, comparison was made with a homologous peptide, with the Gly inserted to recreate the Gly-X-Y pattern: GPOGAAGVMGPOGPO. The magnitude of the 225 nm maximum and the 198 nm minimum are both greater for the GAAGVM peptide (MRE225 nm = 4950 deg cm2/dmol, MRE198 nm = -41127 deg cm2/dmol) when compared with the GAAVM peptide. The thermal stability of GAAGVM is 39.7 °C, 11 °C higher than that of GAAVM, indicating that the absence of the Gly also caused a substantial decrease in stability (Fig. 2). The observed Tm value of 39.7 °C is high and close to that predicted (Tpred = 36 °C) on the basis of host-guest peptides using the collagen stability calculator (37Persikov A.V. Ramshaw J.A. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19343-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Temperature-induced refolding profiles were very similar for both GAAVM and GAAGVM peptides at concentration of 1 mg/ml (data not shown), which may reflect a similar nucleation step. Differential scanning calorimetry indicates that the calorimetric enthalpy for GAAGVM is 354 kJ/mol in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7), whereas the value for GAAVM is 188 kJ/mol (Fig. 3, Table 1), suggesting a substantial loss of hydrogen bonding. The decrease in thermal stability is again observed, although the DSC Tm values are higher than the CD Tm values because of the faster heating rate. The ΔHcal values for both peptides are considerably higher at lower ionic strength (50 mm sodium phosphate), at both neutral and acidic pH (428 kJ/mol for GAAGVM; 259 kJ/mol for GAAVM). Such large ionic strength effects were not observed for other peptides (30Persikov A.V. Xu Y. Brodsky B. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consequence of Increasing Imino Acid Content in the Break—The effect of an artificial break with 4 adjacent non-Gly residues was previously studied in an all Gly-Pro-Hyp environment (25Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The stable (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10 peptide was compared with (Pro-Hyp-Gly)4-Pro-Hyp-Pro-Hyp-Gly-(Pro-Hyp-Gly)4, which is denoted here as the GPOPO peptide (previously designated as the Gly deletion peptide) (25Long C.G. Braswell E. Zhu D. Apigo J. Baum J. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11688-11695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2027044098,"Ca2+ stimulation of adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) is mediated by calmodulin (CaM). An earlier study identified two CaM binding sites in AC8; one that was apparently not essential for AC8 activity, located at the N terminus, and a second site that was critical for Ca2+ stimulation, found at the C terminus (Gu, C., and Cooper, D. M. F. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 8012-8021). This study explores the role of these two CaM binding domains and their interaction in regulating AC8 activity, employing binding and functional studies with mutant CaM and modified AC8 species. We report that the N-terminal CaM binding domain of AC8 has a role in recruiting CaM and that this recruitment is essential to permit stimulation by Ca2+ in vivo. Using Ca2+-insensitive mutants of CaM, we found that partially liganded CaM can bind to AC8, but only fully liganded Ca2+/CaM can stimulate AC8 activity. Moreover, partially liganded CaM inhibited AC8 activity in vivo. The results indicate that CaM pre-associates with the N terminus of AC8, and we suggest that this recruited CaM is used by the C terminus of AC8 to mediate Ca2+ stimulation.

Although a modest sized protein (16.7 kDa), the bi-lobed structure of CaM provides enough interfaces, and conformational changes in response to the binding of four Ca2+ ions, to permit a range of mechanisms whereby it can modulate cellular activity (1Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Each lobe of CaM contains two EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs that are joined by a flexible linker (2Persechini A. Kretsinger R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12175-12178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM can associate with target proteins before it has bound Ca2+ (apo-CaM), when it is partially bound to Ca2+ or fully loaded with Ca2+ (3Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, the two lobes can act independently and bind to different regions within one or more proteins (4Vetter S.W. Leclerc E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Two broad CaM binding domain (CaMBD) classifications have arisen. The first is the “IQ motif,” with the sequence: (F/L/V/I)QXX(R/K)GXX(R/K). IQ motifs are commonly, but not always, Ca2+-independent CaMBDs. The second type of CaMBD usually binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner and is characterized by amphipathic helices with conserved hydrophobic amino acids. This type of CaMBD carries a net positive charge and consists of aromatic residues at either end and basic residues, particularly arginines, in between (5Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar).One important physiological role for CaM is its regulation of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), providing a critical link between the Ca2+ - and cAMP-signaling pathways (6Cooper D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Four of the nine known ACs are Ca2+-sensitive; in particular, adenylyl cyclase type 8 (AC8) is stimulated by Ca2+ /CaM by a mechanism that is not yet resolved. AC8 has two CaMBDs, an amphipathic helix in the N terminus and an IQ-like motif at the C terminus (7Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but their role in Ca2+ /CaM regulation of AC8 is not known. What is clear is that the C-terminal CaMBD is essential for Ca2+ stimulation of AC8. Mutagenesis studies revealed that removal of the C terminus of AC8 produced a Ca2+-insensitive enzyme, whereas removal of the N terminus of AC8 did not affect Ca2+ /CaM stimulation in vitro (7Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This observation raises questions concerning the purpose of the additional CaMBD in the N terminus of AC8.In the intact cell, Ca2+-sensitive ACs are regulated by capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE). CCE is a universally encountered mechanism of Ca2+ entry in non-excitable cells that is triggered by the emptying of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores (8Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Ca2+-sensitive ACs show a unique dependence on CCE for their regulation by Ca2+ in vivo (6Cooper D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Part of the dependence of AC8 on CCE relies on its presence in caveolae or lipid rafts (9Fagan K.A. Smith K.E. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26530-26537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Caveolae are small invaginations within the lipid bilayer that are enriched with cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (10Ikonen E. Simons K. Sem. Cell Devel. Biol. 1998; 9: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because Feron and colleagues (11Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) showed that a CaMBD within nitric-oxide synthase contributed to its targeting to caveolae, the possibility was considered that the N terminus of AC8 might also serve a raft/caveolar-targeting purpose. However, deletion of the N-terminal CaMBD did not affect raft targeting, although the response to CCE was greatly diminished (12Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). No further attempt to understand the role of the N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 has been made, although the speculation was advanced that the N terminus of AC8 might be a CaM-tethering site (7Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CaM certainly can pre-associate with some of its target proteins, prior to a rise in [Ca2+]i. For example, L, P/Q, and R type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) all pre-associate with CaM in resting cells (13Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and L type VGCCs can tether CaM (14Pitt G.S. Zuhlke R.D. Hudmon A. Schulman H. Reuter H. Tsien R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30794-30802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Thus, in the present study, we explore the role played by the N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 in light of its putative function as a tether for CaM. We examine the significance of such tethering in CaM recruitment and consider how this role might be reconciled with the purpose of the second CaMBD located at the C terminus of AC8. We have used mutants of both AC8 and CaM to specifically target the interaction between the two proteins in functional assays and in binding studies. Our results allow the proposal of a tethering and recruiting role for the N terminus of AC8, which is both elegant and conservative in the use of a limiting amount of a universal mediator within the cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Thapsigargin and forskolin were from Calbiochem. [3H]Adenine, [3H]cAMP, [α-32P]ATP, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, ECL Western blotting analysis system, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Promega (Madison, WI). Fura-2, Fura-FF, and Ca2+ standard solutions were obtained from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). AC8 antibody was a gift from Dr. J. J. Cali, as previously described (15Cali J.J. Parekh R.S. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1089-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CaM monoclonal antibody was from Upstate. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless stated otherwise.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures and were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml neomycin (all from Invitrogen), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.Transfection of HEK293 Cells—Cells were grown overnight on 92-mm diameter dishes and transfected the following day at ∼50% confluence, according to the calcium phosphate method described previously (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). Transfection reagent contained CaCl2 (250 mm), HEPES transfection buffer (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4,15 mm d-glucose, 42 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), and cDNA (2 μg for single transfections, 1.5 μg of AC8/AC8M1 with 2 μg of CaM/pcDNA3.1 for cotransfections). Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 12.1 mm Na2HPO4,4mm KH2PO4, 130 mm NaCl, at pH 7.4) 8-12 h after transfection.Preparation of HEK293 Cell Membranes—Membranes were prepared 48 h after transfection by the following procedure. Cells were lysed in homogenization buffer (2 mm MgCl2,50mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μgofDNase I (from Amersham Biosciences), pH 7.4) by repeatedly passing the cell suspension through a 22-gauge needle. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 200 × g (5 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was collected, and the process was repeated. The supernatant fractions from each homogenization were pooled and then centrifuged (23,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Where the non-membrane fraction was required for Western blotting analysis, the supernatant was saved and supplemented with SDS (1% w/v). The membrane pellet was resuspended in either 1% SDS for Western blotting analysis or assay buffer (40 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) for adenylyl cyclase activity measurements. Protein content was determined as previously described (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18446) Google Scholar).Adenylyl Cyclase Activity Measurements—Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined as described previously (18Boyajian C.L. Garritsen A. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4995-5003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes prepared from transfected HEK293 cells were assayed in the presence of the following components: 12 mm phosphocreatine, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 0.04 mm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm ATP, 2.5 units of creatine phosphokinase, 70 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 250 μm EGTA, 1 μm CaM (as indicated), 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP and Ca2+ (see “Determination of Free Ca2+ Concentrations” below). The reaction mixture (100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and terminated with the addition of 100 μl of stopper solution (0.5% w/v SDS, 22 mm ATP, 1.5 mm cAMP). [3H]cAMP (∼3000 cpm) was added as a recovery marker. The [32P]cAMP formed was quantified as previously described (19Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar).Determination of Free Ca2+ Concentrations—Free Ca2+ concentrations were initially established from a series of CaCl2 solutions buffered with 250 μm EGTA in the assay, using the computer program BAD4 (20Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentration was then confirmed by spectrofluorometric measurements (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer) at 340 and 380 nm, the excitation wavelengths of the Ca2+-sensitive dyes Fura-2 or Fura-FF. The Ca2+ concentration of each solution was calculated from the 340/380 nm fluorescence ratio by applying the Grynkiewicz equation (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Accumulation— cAMP accumulation was measured in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, 48 h after transfection. Cells were incubated (2 h, 37 °C) in minimum essential medium containing [3H]adenine (0.5 μCi/well) to label the ATP pool. Cells were washed once and incubated in 900 μl of nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.75 mm KCl, 1.44 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES, 11 mm d-glucose, pH 7.4), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) for 20 min at 30 °C. Cells were preincubated with EGTA (100 μm) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm) for 10.5 min and thapsigargin (100 nm) for 4 min, to passively deplete endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. cAMP accumulation was measured over a 1-min period, started by addition of forskolin (10 μm) and various CaCl2 concentrations. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (5%, w/v). Samples were incubated at 4 °C at least 30 min before addition of unlabeled cAMP (1 μm), unlabeled ATP (0.65 μm), and [α-32P]ATP (∼5000 cpm), used as a recovery marker. Cells were centrifuged (4000 × g, 6 min), and the [3H]cAMP and [3H]ATP content of the supernatant was determined as described previously (19Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar).Whole Cell [Ca2+]i Measurements—[Ca2+]i were measured in cell populations using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer as previously described. Briefly, cells were detached with PBS containing 0.01% EDTA and loaded with 2 μm Fura-2/AM plus 0.02% Pluronic F-127 for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice, aliquoted into samples containing ∼1 × 106 cells, and finally resuspended in 3 ml of nominally Ca2+-free Krebs buffer and placed in a stirred cuvette just prior to the experiment. For zero-Ca2+ Krebs buffer, 100 μm EGTA was added. Test substances were added from 100-fold concentrated stocks. Fura-2 340/380 nm fluorescence ratios were converted to [Ca2+]i values as described previously (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Western Blotting—Proteins were resolved using 7.5 and 12% w/v SDS-polyacrylamide gels for AC8 and CaM, respectively. AC8 gels were prepared in the presence of 8 m urea. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% w/v skimmed milk powder for 30 min, followed by two 10-min washes in TBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-AC8 polyclonal antibody (1:5000) or anti-CaM monoclonal antibody (1:5000) in TTBS containing 1% skimmed milk powder (antibody buffer). The membranes were washed (3 × 10 min) in TTBS and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 dilution of stock) or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:3000) in antibody buffer for 1 h. Finally, the membranes were washed in TTBS (2 × 15 min), rinsed in TBS, and visualized with ECL reagent. The light intensity of each band was detected and quantified on the Gene Gnome Western blot imaging system (Syngene Bio Imaging) using Gene Snap software. The AC8 antibody detects both wild-type AC8 and the deletion mutant, AC8M1, and each protein is detected as two bands, representing the glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the enzyme. The CaM antibody detects the wild type and all mutant species of CaM.Production and Purification of His-tagged CaM—The CaM mutant constructs were a gift from J. H. Caldwell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). CaM mutants contain aspartate to alanine substitutions in either 1) the first and second EF-hand motifs (CaM12) rendering the N lobe of CaM insensitive to Ca2+, 2) the third and fourth EF-hand motifs (CaM34) rendering the C lobe of CaM insensitive to CaM, or 3) All four EF-hand motifs (CaM1234) rendering both lobes of CaM insensitive to Ca2+. To obtain fragments containing either wild-type CaM or the desired CaM mutant, the cDNA was PCR-amplified and then digested using BamHI and NcoI restriction enzymes. The CaM cDNA fragment was then ligated into the vector pQE30 (Qiagen, UK), which had also been digested with BamHI/NcoI. This added a His tag to the N terminus of each CaM construct. His-tagged CaM was produced in Escherichia coli cell cultures, which were induced at A600 = 0.4 to produce the CaM protein with 2 mm isopropyl β-d-thio galactopyranoside at 37 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), and supplemented with lysozyme. Samples were gently mixed for 5 min at room temperature before sonication. The bacterial cell lysates were centrifuged (25,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatants were applied to a Talon metal affinity resin column (BD Biosciences). After several washes with wash buffer, the His-tagged CaM was eluted with sample buffer (10 mm Tris, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.6). Protein concentration was determined following the method of Smith and colleagues (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18446) Google Scholar).Preparation and Purification of GST and GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins of the N terminus (GST-AC8Nt) and C terminus (GST-AC8Ct) of AC8 were generated. The N terminus of AC8 up to amino acid A97 was PCR-amplified from the full-length rat cDNA with primers that introduced an EcoRI site at the 5′-end and a SalI site at the 3′-end. The product was digested with EcoRI/SalI and ligated into the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), which had also been digested with EcoRI/SalI. The C terminus of AC8, from amino acids Asp-1106 to Pro-1248 was generated following the same method. The fusion proteins were produced using bacterial cell cultures, which were induced and then harvested as described above (see “Production and Purification of His-tagged CaM”). Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (20 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm EDTA, 1.3 μm bestatin, 140 nm E-64, 10 nm leupeptin, 3 nm aprotinin) and lysozyme. After sonication and addition of Triton X-100 (1% (v/v)), cell lysates were centrifuged (25,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST-AC8 peptide bound to the beads was washed with PBS to remove contaminants and stored at 4 °C until required.GST Pulldown Assay—GST, GST-AC8Nt, or GST-AC8Ct glutathione-Sepharose beads were added to PBS supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 μm CaM, and either 20 μm CaCl2 or 200 μm EGTA for high and low Ca2+ condition, respectively. Samples were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged (19,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and washed three times in PBS. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using a CaM antibody, as described above (see “Western Blotting”).RESULTSThe N Terminus of AC8 Recruits CaM to Mediate Ca2+ Stimulation—It has been noted previously that the amphipathic helix CaMBD within the N terminus of AC8 is not of obvious significance in in vitro adenylyl cyclase activity assays. Deletion of the first 106 N-terminal amino acids of AC8 yielded an enzyme (AC8M1) that was fully stimulated by Ca2+ /CaM in vitro (7Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present study followed on from this observation by initially comparing the Ca2+ stimulation of full-length AC8 and AC8M1 and their dependence on exogenous CaM. To address CaM recruitment by AC8, we evaluated our ability to deplete membrane CaM by our washing procedure, which used 1 mm EGTA. Washing the membranes in EGTA reduced the CaM content of the membrane preparation by ∼80%, compared with washing in EGTA-free assay buffer (Fig. 1A). The activity of EGTA-washed membranes prepared from cells transfected with either AC8 or AC8M1 or untransfected cells was then compared in vitro. AC activity was stimulated by a range of [Ca2+] in the presence and absence of exogenously applied CaM (1 μm). AC activity is a measure of cAMP converted from ATP. The maximum activity value produced by Ca2+ stimulation depends on transfection efficiency. The greater the expression level of AC8, the higher the maximum production of cAMP that can be attained. Untransfected HEK 293 cells have a low basal activity, which is slightly inhibited by Ca2+ in a CaM-independent manner, due to the presence of endogenous Ca2+-inhibitable AC6 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). Efficient transfection of AC8 is detected by the robust -fold stimulation of basal activity in response to Ca2+ /CaM, not the maximum activity value. The -fold stimulation ranged from 5- to 11-fold (mean = 7.9 ± 2; n = 7) for AC8 and 5- to 13-fold (mean = 8.0 ± 2.5; n = 7) for AC8M1. Fig. 1 shows a representative experiment of Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 (Fig. 1B) and AC8M1 (Fig. 1C). The -fold stimulation in this example was 11-fold and 13-fold, respectively, and is in good agreement with earlier work (7Gu C. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8012-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A Western blot confirms similar expression levels for each construct (Fig. 1E). The pattern of Ca2+ stimulation was very similar for both constructs, with mean half-activation (Kd value) occurring at 0.8 μm ± 0.2 and 1.2 μm± 0.2 Ca2+ (n = 3) for AC8 and AC8M1, respectively. Without exogenous CaM, Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 was retained compared with untransfected cells but was reduced to only a 4-fold increase over basal activity (Fig. 1B). Typical Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 in the absence of CaM ranged from 2.3- to 4-fold over basal (mean = 3.1 ± 0.7; n = 7). The mean Kd value was 1.7 μm± 0.2 (n = 3). The persistence of Ca2+ stimulation of AC8 suggests that residual CaM had been retained by AC8, despite the extensive washing with EGTA. In contrast, AC8M1 activity was not enhanced above basal levels in the absence of added CaM (Fig. 1C, open circles), implying that any associated CaM had been removed. This finding suggests that, (i) the N terminus of AC8 associates with endogenous CaM and (ii) the CaM retained by the N terminus of AC8 can be utilized by the C terminus to mediate Ca2+ stimulation in vitro, in the absence of added CaM. These data imply that the N terminus could be an excellent device for recruiting CaM.If indeed the N terminus serves to recruit CaM to AC8, the CaMBD within the N terminus is the most likely site. However non-contiguous sequences surrounding a CaMBD can be involved in CaM interaction (22Xiong L. Kleerekoper Q.K. He R. Putkey J.A. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7070-7079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), so we considered the possibility that other amino acids of the N terminus could also participate. To delimit the CaM recruitment site specifically to the obvious CaMBD, a second AC8 mutant (AC8M34) was explored. The helical CaMBD of AC8 is located between residues 34 and 51. In AC8M34, 6 of these amino acids, specifically tryptophan, glutamine, threonine, arginine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine, have all been substituted to alanine, rendering the CaMBD very unlikely to bind CaM (12Smith K.E. Gu C. Fagan K.A. Hu B. Cooper D.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6025-6031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The AC8M34 mutant was expressed in HEK293 cells, and activity was measured in EGTA-washed membrane preparations. AC8M34 was stimulated by CaCl2 in the presence and absence of CaM. The Ca2+-concentration effect profile of AC8M34 was the same as AC8M1, with 7-fold Ca2+ stimulation in the presence of exogenous CaM (Fig. 1D). The Kd value was higher (1.9 μm) than the mean Kd for AC8M1 (1.2 μm) but not significantly so. AC8M34 activity was not stimulated above basal levels in the absence of CaM. The similar dependence of AC8M1 and AC8M34 on CaM for Ca2+ stimulation establishes that the N-terminal CaMBD is the principal CaM binding site within the N terminus of AC8.The N Terminus of AC8 Is Essential for Ca2+ Stimulation in Vivo— The N terminus of AC8 evidently binds to CaM, which can then be used to activate AC8. However, this recruitment is redundant in vitro when CaM is provided and is in excess. In vitro measurements do not reflect the environment that AC8 experiences within the intact cell, where free CaM levels are regulated and limited (23Persechini A. Cronk B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6827-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our initial results prompted the question of whether AC8M1 would be active in the intact cell, where the free CaM concentration is restricted. To resolve this issue, whole cell cAMP accumulation was measured in response to CCE, using HEK293 cells that had been transiently transfected with either AC8 or AC8M1 and compared with untransfected cells. EGTA and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were added to chelate extracellular Ca2+ and inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, respectively. The sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase was inhibited with thapsigargin to passively deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores, priming the cells for CCE upon addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2A (panel (i)) shows the increase in [Ca2+]i following activation of CCE. AC8 was stimulated by Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner compared with untransfected cells, which did not respond to CCE. AC8M1, however, had lower basal activity and was not significantly stimulated by the addition of up to 4 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 2A, panel (ii)). These data reveal that the N terminus of AC8 is essential for Ca2+ stimulation and support the proposal that the N terminus is needed to recruit CaM for AC8 activation.FIGURE 2The sensitivity of AC8 and AC8M1 to capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) in vivo. In A: Panel (i), CCE in HEK293 transiently transfected with AC8. Cell populations were loaded with Fura-2 to measure changes in [Ca2+]i during the induction of CCE by 1, 2, and 4 mm CaCl2, respectively. Panel (ii), the effect of CCE on cAMP accumulation, measured over a 1-min assay, using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with AC8 and pcDNA3.1 vector, AC8M1, and pcDNA3.1 or untransfected cells. Data are plotted as mean ± S.D. and are representative of five separate experiments, with similar results.

Because application of exogenous CaM permits full activity of AC8M1 in vitro, we wondered whether overexpression of CaM in vivo would rescue AC8M1 activity, thereby overcoming the absence of CaM recruited by the N terminus. AC8 and AC8M1 were co-"

We used human cDNA microarrays to identify, in infected cells, genes differentially expressed after PKR expression and analyzed the requirement of catalytic activity of the enzyme. To express PKR, we used vaccinia virus (VV) recombinants producing wild type PKR (VV-PKR) and the catalytically inactive mutant K296R (VV-PKR-K296R). Most regulated genes were classified according to biological function, including apoptosis, stress, defense, and immune response. Transcriptional changes detected by microarray analysis were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR. A total of 111 genes were regulated specifically by PKR catalytic activity. Of these, 97 were up-regulated, and 14 were down-regulated. The ATF-3 transcription factor, involved in stress-induced β-cell apoptosis, was up-regulated. Activation of endogenous PKR with a VV mutant lacking the viral protein E3L (VVΔE3L), a PKR inhibitor, triggered an increase in ATF-3 expression that was not observed in PKR-/- cells. Using null cells for ATF-3 and for the p65 subunit of NF-κB, we showed that induction of apoptosis by PKR at late times of infection was dependent on ATF-3 expression and regulated by NF-κB activation. Here, we identified human genes selectively induced by expression of active PKR in infected cells and linked ATF-3 to a novel mechanism used by PKR to induce apoptosis.

The genes involved in PKR-induced apoptosis in infected human cells have not been defined. We previously described an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible VV system in which PKR expression triggers apoptosis (5Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 18Gil J. Esteban M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). When PKR was expressed, the antiviral action against VV and vesicular stomatitis virus provoked a translational block by phosphorylation of eIF-2α and triggered NF-κB activation through the IκB kinase complex (5Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 10Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1993; 193: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Lee S.B.

Results using this inducible virus-cell system have been validated in transfected cells or cells derived from PKR gene knock-out mice (6Der S.D. Yang Y.L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3279-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 18Gil J. Esteban M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The VV inducible system was also used to identify apoptotic viral genes (21Suarez P. Diaz-Guerra M. Prieto C. Esteban M. Castro J.M. Nieto A. Ortin J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2876-2882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as cellular and viral inhibitors of apoptosis (18Gil J. Esteban M. J.

To identify host genes involved in PKR-induced apoptosis of cells infected with VV recombinants, we used cDNA microarray high-throughput screening of over 15,000 human genes. With RNAs obtained from VV-PKR-infected HeLa cells at late but not at early times postinfection, we found transcriptional alteration in defined gene subsets. Comparison of VV-PKR with the catalytically inactive VV-PKR-K296R mutant showed that PKR catalytic activity was required for regulation of these genes. When grouped into functional categories, a significant proportion of altered transcripts consisted of genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, stress, defense, and immune response. The genes up-regulated by PKR activity included ATF-3, a stress-inducible gene that encodes a member of the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein family of transcription factors (23Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). ATF-3 is induced by PERK and GCN4 (25Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), but this is the first report of ATF-3 up-regulation by PKR. Here, we provided evidence that ATF-3 is specifically induced by PKR and is involved in PKR-induced apoptosis and that induction of apoptosis by PKR is regulated by NF-κB. These findings add the transcription factor ATF-3 to the specific mechanisms used by PKR to induce apoptosis. Cells and Viruses—HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum and antibiotics. Mouse 3T3-like fibroblasts derived from homozygous PKR-deficient mice (PKR-/-) (26Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) were obtained from C. Weissmann (University of Zurich, Switzerland) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. ATF-3-/- cells and their wild type counterparts were kindly provided by T. Hai (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Briefly, MEF cells were isolated by trypsinization of embryos from ATF-3-/- mice and immortalized by infection with a recombinant retrovirus expressing simian virus 40 large T antigen (25Jiang H.Y. Wek S.A. McGrath B.C. Lu D. Hai T. Harding H.P. Wang X. Ron D. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). p65-/- cells and wild type counterparts were a gift from A. Martín (Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, Valencia, Spain). p65-/- MEF cells were also isolated from embryos of p65-/- mice and immortalized by several passages (27Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). MEF cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. VV recombinants expressing PKR (wild-type enzyme, VV-PKR), VV-PKRK296R (the catalytically inactive point mutant K296R), and VV-Hsp70 (VV expressing the human heat shock protein Hsp-70) were grown on monkey BSC-40 cells, purified by sucrose gradient banding, and titrated on BSC-40 cells by plaque assay. Unless otherwise indicated, VV infections were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell. Microarray Production—To generate cDNA arrays, we used the Research Genetics 40K sequence-verified clone human cDNA library (available on the World Wide Web at www.resgen.com/products/SVHcDNA.php3), as described (28Guerra S. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. Pascual-Montano A. Munoz M. Harshman K. Esteban M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6493-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Slides contained 15,360 cDNAs, of which 13,295 corresponded to known genes and 2,257 corresponded to control genes. DNA was printed on CMT-GAPS II slides (Corning) with a Microgrid II (BioRobotics) at 22 °C and 40-45% relative humidity. Microarray Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from VV-PKR-, VV-, or VV-PKR-K296R-infected HeLa cells cultured in 10-cm plates with Ultraspect-II RNA (Biotecx) following the manufacturer's instructions. At 6 and 16 h postinfection (hpi), two RNA samples (1 μg each) were processed for analysis from each infected HeLa cell culture; each sample was used for two distinct hybridizations (dye swapping). Two different microarray approaches were used. In the first approach, we hybridized cDNA from VV-PKR-infected cells against VV-infected HeLa cells; in the second, we hybridized cDNA from VV-PKR-infected cells against VV-PKR-K296R-infected cells. In both cases, we performed four hybridizations for each postinfection time. Labeling and hybridization conditions were as described (28Guerra S. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. Pascual-Montano A. Munoz M. Harshman K. Esteban M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6493-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Guerra S. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. Conde R. Pascual-Montano A. Harshman K. Esteban M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5820-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Slides were dried by centrifugation and scanned on a ScanArray 4000 (Packard Biosciences) using ScanArray 3.1 software. Raw data were obtained from Cy5 and Cy3 images using QuantArray 3.0 software (Packard Biosciences) and processed using SOLAR software (BioALMA, Spain). Briefly, background was subtracted from the signal, and the log 10 (signal) was plotted versus log 2 (ratio) and Lowess-normalized to adjust most spots to log ratio 0. This was calculated for all four replicates, and a table was obtained with mean signal, x-fold change, log ratio, S.D. of the log ratio, and z-score (30Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32 (suppl.): 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Gene Expression Analysis—The original data set contained 13,295 clones/slide. In each analysis, genes with an interreplicate S.D. value of >1 were removed. The resulting data set was reduced to the transcripts that showed a consistent expression value among the four replicates. The z-score value (a measure of the proximity of one value (log ratio) to other values with a similar signal) was used to eliminate genes that did not show significant expression in at least one experimental condition (30Quackenbush J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32 (suppl.): 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). A 1:40 dilution of the RT reaction mixture was used for quantitative PCR. Primers and probe sets used to amplify H2BFB, caspase-9, ATF-3, NFκBIA, NFκB-2, interleukin-6, and IFN-γ were purchased from Applied Biosystems. RT-PCRs were performed according to Assay-on-Demand, optimized to work with TaqMan Universal PCR MasterMix, No AmpErase UNG, as described (29Guerra S. Lopez-Fernandez L.A. Conde R. Pascual-Montano A. Harshman K. Esteban M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 5820-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All samples were assayed in duplicate. Threshold cycle (Ct) values were used to plot a standard curve in which Ct decreased in linear proportion to the log of the template copy number. The correlation values of standard curves were always >99%. Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were infected in 6-well plates with VVPKR, VV, or VV-PKR-K296R (5 pfu/cell) and collected at 6 and 16 hpi in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS). Protein lysates were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer, and equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by 14 or 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with primary anti-PKR (31Gil J. Garcia M.A. Esteban M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), anti-PKR-P (Calbiochem), anti-Hsp70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-caspase-9 (Oncogene), anti-ATF-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ATF-4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GADD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PARP-1 (Cell Signaling), eIF-2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), eIF-2α-P (BIOSOURCE), actin (Sigma), or NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by peroxidase-conjugated mouse or rabbit secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Metabolic Labeling of Proteins—HeLa cell monolayers in 12-well plates were infected with VV-PKR, VV, or VV-PKR-K296R (5 pfu/cell). At the postinfection times indicated, cells were washed with methionine-free medium and incubated in methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (50 μCi/well, 30 min, 37 °C). Proteins from cell extracts prepared in lysis buffer were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and developed by autoradiography. Immunofluorescence—HeLa or PKR-/- cells cultured on coverslips were infected with the recombinant viruses indicated. At 16 hpi, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized (10 min, room temperature) with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, washed, and blocked with 20% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with anti-PKR, anti-Hsp-70, or anti-ATF-3 antibody; coverslips were washed extensively with PBS and were further incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with ToPro (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and appropriate fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated isotype-specific secondary antibodies. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using Mowiol (Calbiochem). Images were obtained using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal laser microscope. Apoptosis Measurement by ELISA—HeLa, ATF-3-/-, and p65-/- cells and their wild type counterparts were grown in 12-well plates, infected (5 pfu/cell) with the viruses indicated, and harvested at 24 hpi. We used the cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Roche Applied Science) to determine the absorbance at 405 nm. This assay is based on the quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle and uses mouse monoclonal antibodies against DNA and histones to estimate the amount of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA. Duplicate samples were measured in two independent experiments. Measurement of Apoptotic Cell Death by Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle stages and the percentage of cells with sub-G0 DNA content were analyzed by propidium iodide staining (32Martin A.G.

ATF-3-/- and p65-/- cells and their wild type counterparts were uninfected or infected at 5 pfu/cell with VV or VV-PKR strains in the presence or absence of benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, a general caspase inhibitor (40 μm; Calbiochem), or staurosporine, an apoptosis activator (0.5 μm; Sigma). Cells were permeabilized at 24 hpi with 70% ethanol in PBS (4 °C, 30 min). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with RNase A (0.1 mg/ml, 37 °C, 45 min) and stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml). The percentage of cells with hypodiploid DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. Data were acquired on 6000 cells/sample and analyzed as described (32Martin A.G. Fearnhead H.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50834-50841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Gel Retardation Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts (3 μg) from the indicated cells grown in 6-cm well plates, either uninfected or infected with VV or VV-PKR at 5 pfu/cell for the indicated times, were analyzed using the synthetic [α-32P]dCTP-labeled double-stranded wild-type HIV enhancer oligonucleotide 5′-AGCTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3′, containing two κB consensus motifs, following protocols described previously (33Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thompson J. Rodriguez M.S. Bachelerie F. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA (1 μg) was used to identify ATF-3 and ATF-3ΔZip2a mRNAs using the Superscript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription (Invitrogen). The PCR was performed at 95 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min for 26 cycles. To amplify the full-length ATF-3 and ATF-3ΔZip2a mRNAs, the pair of primers used were 5′-ATGATGCTTCAACACCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-TTAGCTCTGCAATGTTCCTTC-3′ (described in Ref. 34Hashimoto Y. Zhang C.

Bands of 546 and 858 bp represented products of full-length ATF3 and the spliced form ATF-3ΔZip2a. Gene Profiling of HeLa Cells Infected with VV Recombinants Expressing Wild Type PKR or the Catalytically Inactive PKR Mutant K296R— Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible VV recombinants that express wild type (VV-PKR) or the K296R mutant PKR (VV-PKRK296R) were used to study the cell transcriptional response after PKR expression in HeLa cells. In this virus-cell system, we previously reported that PKR is produced between 2 and 4 hpi, it is autophosphorylated by 6-9 hpi (10Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1993; 193: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Gil J. Alcami J. Esteban M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its substrate eIF-2α is phosphorylated from 6 to 10 hpi, leading to severe protein synthesis inhibition by 16 hpi (10Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1993; 193: 1037-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 19Lee S.B. Rodriguez D. Rodriguez J.R. Esteban M. Virology. 1997; 231: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, in HeLa cells infected with VV-PKR, protein synthesis is strongly inhibited at late times postinfection, and this translational block correlated with phosphorylation of PKR and of eIF-2α. The reduced protein synthesis was not due to a decrease in protein load in the gels, since the levels of actin and of total eIF-2α were similar in all lanes of Fig. 1. A clear phosphorylation of wild type PKR was shown from 6 hpi. However, the absence of catalytic activity of the mutant PKR correlates with the lack of autophosphorylation (Fig. 1). We used cDNA microarray technology to compare the relative abundance of specific PKR-induced mRNAs in VV-PKR-versus VV-infected HeLa cells at 6 and 16 hpi. At 6 hpi, we observed, with the exception of PKR mRNA, very few altered genes after PKR expression, validating the virus-cell system (not shown). At 16 hpi, analysis of the list of cellular genes up-regulated by PKR expression indicated several gene families with distinct biological functions (supplemental Table 1); these included genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, stress, defense, and immune modulation. The levels of PKR were enhanced 15-fold in VVPKR-versus VV-infected HeLa cell, indicating the correct induction of PKR (supplemental Table 1). In parallel, we analyzed the specific mRNAs induced by PKR catalytic activity, for which we performed a microarray analysis comparing VV-PKR-with VV-PKRK296R-infected HeLa cells at 6 and 16 hpi. Again, very few altered genes were found at 6 hpi (not shown). However, clear differences were observed at 16 hpi. Genes regulated by PKR catalytic activity were classified according to biological function, which included cell cycle regulation and immune modulation (supplemental Table 2). We chose selected regulated genes identified in microarray analysis for target verification by quantitative RT-PCR. The RNA preparation used was the same as that used in the microarray. We analyzed five up-regulated genes (NFκBIA, NFκB-2, interleukin-6, ATF-3, caspase-9, and H2BFB) and one unaltered gene (IFN-γ); HPRT was used as internal control. The RT-PCR data confirmed microarray results, showing the same relative transcription regulation of the selected genes (Table 1) and validating microarray analysis. Absolute values are not identical when comparing microarray and RT-PCR data, probably due to differences intrinsic to the techniques.TABLE 1Validation of microarray data by real time RT-PCR RT-PCR conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The name of each gene product, values of microarray data at different experimental conditions, and values obtained after RT-PCR are indicated.Gene product-Fold changeVV-PKR versus VVVV-PKR versus VV-PKR-K296RMicroarrayRT-PCRMicroarrayRT-PCR-foldH2BFB3.482.244.214.78NFκBIA2.923.22.313.10Interleukin9.38.712.610.5IFN-γ1.21.121.131.03NFκB-24.525.273.694.03Caspase-92.593.211.251.35ATF-37.016.53.694.82 Open table in a new tab Although changes in mRNA levels do not necessarily represent changes in protein expression, we analyzed whether changes in gene expression detected in microarray analysis correlated with expression and activation of selected gene products. To confirm the microarray data, we analyzed two proteins, one that is up-regulated (caspase-9) and another that is down-regulated (Hsp70). Transcriptional activation of caspase-9 detected by microarray does not correlate with an apparent increase in the caspase-9 protein level, as measured by Western blot. However, in VV-PKR-infected HeLa cells, there is enhanced caspase-9 activation, as indicated by cleavage of the procaspase-9 (Fig. 2A). Activation of caspase-9 was not observed in cells infected with VV-PKR-K296R or VV or in uninfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). Apoptosis is mediated by activation of caspase-8 or -9, leading to induction of effector caspase-3 and -7, which cleave specific substrates, including PARP-1. This enzyme catalyzes formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers on acceptor proteins involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure, indicating activation of the apoptotic cascade (36Soldani C. Scovassi A.I. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Since PKR expression induced changes in caspase-9 activation, we analyzed whether PKR activation correlated with PARP-1 cleavage using an antibody that recognizes only the cleaved protein. After VV-PKR infection, we found the 89-kDa PARP-1 cleavage product, indicating that effector-caspases were activated (Fig. 2A). To confirm catalytic activation of PKR, we measured phosphorylation of eIF-2α as a PKR substrate. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α was observed only in VV-PKR-infected cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast to caspase-9 activation, Hsp70 protein levels decreased after PKR expression, concurring with the Hsp70 transcript down-regulation observed in microarray analysis (Fig. 2A). Since Hsp70 suppresses PKR activity in hematopoietic cells (37Pang Q. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Koretsky T. Bagby G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49638-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we analyzed the subcellular localization of Hsp70 and PKR in HeLa cells by triple confocal microscopy, using anti-PKR and anti-Hsp70 antibodies and ToPro to detect DNA (Fig. 2B). Hsp70 expression by VV resulted in characteristic punctate cytosolic localization of endogenous protein (not shown). PKR expression was mainly cytosolic, with strong perinuclear localization. When PKR and Hsp70 were coexpressed, we detected PKR and Hsp70 colocalization in the merged images (Fig. 2B). To evaluate the functional effect of Hsp70 on PKR activity, we coexpressed these proteins and measured PKR-induced cell death. VV-PKR infection induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, whereas in the presence of Hsp70, the percentage of PKR-triggered apoptotic cells was reduced by more than 70%. Apoptosis was not detected following expression of Hsp70 alone (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that Hsp70 inhibits the proapoptotic effect of PKR. Since PKR down-regulates Hsp70, reduced Hsp70 synthesis would promote more active PKR in the cells. PKR Induces ATF-3 Protein Expression—ATF-3, a 181-amino acid protein, is a member of the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding protein family of transcription factors and is maintained at low levels in quiescent cells (23Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 321-335PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the increase in the ATF-3 messenger after PKR expression, we used Western blot to analyze the effect of PKR on ATF-3 protein levels in PKR-/- cells. Whereas overall protein levels were reduced, ATF-3 was increased after VV-PKR infection in comparison to mock-, VV-, or V"
https://openalex.org/W2017540458,"Expression of surfactant protein C (SP-C), which is restricted to alveolar type II epithelial cells of the adult lung, is critically dependent on thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). In the present study we have demonstrated that Erm, a member of the Ets family of transcription factors, is expressed in the distal lung epithelium during development and is also restricted to alveolar type II cells in the adult. Erm was up-regulated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) in culture, and blocking FGF signaling inhibited Erm expression both in vivo and in vitro. The SP-C minimal promoter was found to contain two potential Ets binding sites, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that two 20-bp wild-type oligonucleotides containing the 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′ Ets consensus binding motif were shifted by nuclear extracts from MLE15 cells. Co-transfection assays showed that Erm by itself had little effect on SP-C promoter activity but that Erm significantly enhanced TTF-1-mediated SP-C transcription. Mutation of one of the Ets binding sites reduced SP-C transcription to background levels, whereas mutation of the other site resulted in increased SP-C transcription. Protein-protein interactions between Erm and TTF-1 were demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Mapping studies showed that the Ets domain of Erm and the combined N terminus and homeodomain of TTF-1 were critical for this interaction. Treatment of primary cultures of adult alveolar type II cells with siRNA targeting Erm diminished expression of both Erm and SP-C but had no effect on β-actin or GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Erm is involved in SP-C regulation, which results from an interaction with TTF-1.

After a series of dichotomous and lateral branchings that form the pulmonary tree, the most distal epithelium continues to expand and mature during late gestation and early postnatal life to give rise to mature alveoli. Two cell types constitute the alveolar epithelium, alveolar type I and type II cells. Type I cells have a highly attenuated morphology that is ideally suited for gas exchange (1Williams M.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), whereas the more cuboidal type II cells function in a number of capacities. These include serving as progenitor cells for type I cells, directionally transporting sodium from apical to basolateral cell surfaces to minimize alveolar fluid, producing molecules involved in innate host defense, and synthesizing and secreting pulmonary surfactant (2Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. 1997; ((R.G. Crystal, J. B. W., et al., Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA): 543-555Google Scholar). Proximate tissue interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme play a critical role in lung morphogenesis and differentiation. Tissue recombination studies have shown that distal lung epithelial differentiation is induced as a specific response to signals produced by lung mesenchyme (3Shannon J.M. Nielsen L.D. Gebb S.A. Randell S.H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Shannon J.M. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 600-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, tissue recombination experiments in which epithelial and mesenchymal rudiments are physically separated by an interposed filter have shown that these inductive cues are diffusible (5Taderera J.T. Dev. Biol. 1967; 16: 489-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Shannon J.M. J. Jpn. Med. Soc. Biol. Interface. 1996; 26: 47S-65SGoogle Scholar).

SP-C, which is found only in the lung, is expressed in the distal epithelium during early lung development (12Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), then is restricted to alveolar type II cells late in gestation and postnatally. Restriction of SP-C expression to the lung epithelium is conferred by regulatory elements located within –215 bp of the human SP-C promoter (13Glasser S.W. Burhans M.S. Eszterhas S.K. Bruno M.D. Korfhagen T.R. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2000; 278: L933-L945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region, which is highly homologous between humans and mice, contains conserved binding sites for thyroid transcription factor 1, a phosphorylated, homeodomain-containing member of the Nkx nuclear transcription factor family (TTF-1; also called Nkx2.1 and T-EBP; mouse genomic designation Titf1) (14Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). TTF-1 is expressed in the epithelium of the developing lung, thyroid, and in the central nervous system. TTF-1 is critical for normal lung formation, since Titf1 null mutant mice die at birth from a lack of peripheral lung tissues (15Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The phenotype of mice in which the serine phosphorylation sites of TTF-1 are mutated (Titf1PM/PM) is also neonatal lethal, and the expression of known TTF-1 target proteins is decreased (16DeFelice M. Silberschmidt D. DiLauro R. Xu Y. Wert S.E. Weaver T.E. Bachurski C.J. Clark J.C. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35574-35583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The effects on lung morphogenesis are not as severe in the phosphorylation mutant, since lobulation and early branching morphogenesis are maintained, but formation of peripheral structures late in development is still compromised. Experiments done in our laboratory using tissue recombinants (3Shannon J.M. Nielsen L.D. Gebb S.A. Randell S.H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and mesenchyme-free culture (10Shannon J.M. Gebb S.A. Nielsen L.D. Development. 1999; 126: 1675-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the entire embryonic respiratory tract epithelium exhibits a substantial plasticity in its eventual phenotype. These observations led us to speculate that the differences in embryonic trachea and lung are defined by a limited subset of genes and that a molecular comparison of these two tissues might provide new information on genes that are important for both lung and trachea development. We, therefore, used microarray analysis to identify genes differentially regulated in the embryonic lung and trachea (17Lin S. Shannon J.M. Chest. 2002; 121: 80S-81SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the differentially expressed genes we identified was Erm (Ets-related molecule), a member of the Ets transcription factor family. In the present study we demonstrate that Erm is increasingly restricted to the distal epithelium as lung development progresses and is found only in type II cells in the adult lung. Embryonic tracheal epithelium does not contain Erm or SP-C but can be induced by lung mesenchyme to express both genes in the same spatial domain. Erm, like SP-C, is regulated by FGF signaling both in vivo and in vitro. We show that, although Erm by itself does not affect SP-C expression, it interacts with TTF-1 to increase SP-C transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated suppression of Erm in primary cultures of type II cells concomitantly decreases expression of SP-C. Animals—All protocols involving the use of mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center. Lung and tracheal tissues that were used for the isolation of Erm cDNA, the ontogenetic expression of Erm, tissue recombination studies, and mesenchyme-free culture were obtained from FVB/N mice. Adult type II cells were obtained from C57Bl/6 mice. Titf1–/– mice were generated on a C57Bl/6 background (15Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The generation of transgenic FVB/N mice that conditionally express a soluble dominant-negative FGF receptor (FGFR-Hc) in the lung has been described elsewhere (18Hokuto I. Perl A.K. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Generation of transgenic mice conditionally expressing the FGF antagonist Sprouty-4 (Spry-4) in the developing lung epithelium has been described (19Perl A.K. Hokuto I. Impagnatiello M.A. Christofori G. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 2003; 258: 154-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Timed-pregnant females of both transgenic strains were given doxycycline in their food (625 mg/kg; Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI) beginning on day E0.5, and embryonic lungs were harvested on day E13.5. Generation of Erm Construct—All procedures involving oligonucleotide and cDNA manipulations were performed essentially as described in Sambrook et al. (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1989; (Cold Spring Harbor, New York): 153-185PubMed Google Scholar). We generated the Erm construct by reverse transcription-PCR using total lung RNA from E11.5 embryos. A cDNA fragment comprising the Erm coding sequence to which a FLAG tag was added to the 3′ end was generated using the primers 5′-primer (5′-GCGGATCCACCATGGATGGGTTTTGT-3′) specific to Erm and adding a BamHI restriction site (underlined) to the 5′ end and 3′-primer (5′-GCTCTAGATTActtgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtcGTAAGCGAAGCCTTC-3′) specific to the last 15 bp of Erm coding sequence (uppercase letters) and 24 bp of the FLAG epitope tag (lowercase letters) followed by a stop codon and adding a XbaI site (underlined) to the 3′ end. The PCR product was subsequently digested with BamHI and XbaI restriction enzymes (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) that had been digested with BamHI and XbaI. The resulting expression construct, hereafter pErmFLAG, was sequenced in both directions, and no mutations were detected. Plasmids, Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Assays—The reporter plasmid pGL3/SPCluc (a gift of Dr. C. Bachurski, Cincinnati Children's Hospital) was created by cloning the 0.32-kb minimal mouse SP-C promoter sequence (14Kelly S.E. Bachurski C.J. Burhans M.S. Glasser S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6881-6888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL3 (Promega, Madison, WI). The two putative Ets binding sites in this promoter were mutated by PCR to XhoI (CTCGAG) sites to generate the single mutations M2 (–200 to –195) and M1 (–125 to 120) as well as a M1M2 double mutation (Fig. 5A). The three mutated fragments were subcloned into pGL3 to generate SPC/M1luc, SPC/M2luc, and SPC/M1M2luc, and their sequences were confirmed. Genomatrix software was used to verify that no known enhancer/repressor sites were generated. The TTF-1 expression plasmid pCMV-TTF-1 was a gift of Dr. R. DiLauro (Stazione Zoologica, Naples, Italy). The pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was used to monitor and normalize transfection efficiency. Human JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. MLE-15 cells were grown in HITES medium (21Wikenheiser K.A. Vorbroker D.K. Rice W.R. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Oie H.K. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11029-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well dishes and grown to 50–70% confluence. The amount of plasmid DNA transfected into the cells was kept constant at 800 ng/well; any differences among groups were compensated using empty pcDNA3 vector. All plasmids were transiently transfected into JEG-3 or MLE-15 cells using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Expression constructs were transfected at the following concentrations: pGL3/SPCluc, 270 ng/well; pErmFLAG, 170 ng/well; pCMV-TTF-1, 170 ng/well; pRL-TK, 20 ng/well. Constructs for the Ets site mutation analysis were transfected into JEG-3 cells at the following concentrations: SPCluc, SPC/M1luc, SPC/M2luc, and SPC/M1M2luc, 380 ng/well; pErmFLAG, 200 ng/well; pCMV-TTF-1, 200 ng/well; pRL-TK, 20 ng/well. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were assessed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), with light units quantified by luminometry (Monolight 3010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Tissue Recombinations, Mesenchyme-free Epithelial Culture, and Explant Culture—Tissue recombinants composed of lung mesenchyme plus either lung epithelium or tracheal epithelium were prepared as previously described (3Shannon J.M. Nielsen L.D. Gebb S.A. Randell S.H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 212: 482-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tracheal epithelial rudiments for mesenchyme-free culture were isolated from E11.5 embryos and enrobed in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biomedical) as previously described (10Shannon J.M. Gebb S.A. Nielsen L.D. Development. 1999; 126: 1675-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rudiments were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 3% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml human transferrin (both from BD Biomedical), 1 μg/ml cholera toxin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA), 25 ng/ml mouse recombinant epidermal growth factor, 10 ng/ml human recombinant hepatocyte growth factor, 200 ng/ml bovine FGF1 (all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 25 ng/ml human recombinant FGF7 (PreproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Lungs from E12.5 embryos were cultured for 24 h on 8-μm pore nucleopore track-etch membranes (Whatman International, Clifton, NJ) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 plus 5% fetal bovine serum. Explants were treated with the FGF receptor antagonist SU5402 (EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) at 10 μm; controls were treated with 0.1% Me2SO. Real-time PCR—Gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR using a Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and DNA master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science). Template cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA as described above, and an equal amount of input cDNA was used in each set of PCR reactions. Template cDNA was mixed with 1× SYBR mix, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 μm concentrations of each primer. Reaction conditions were 95 °C for 15 s followed by 40 cycles of amplification step (95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s). β-actin and L32 were used as normalization standards. Changes in gene expression are given as percent changes versus controls. For the gels shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4, parallel real-time PCR reactions were performed, with the modification that all reactions were terminated when the sample(s) with the highest level of expression reached the plateau. The sequences of the primers used were: Erm (151 bp), forward primer 5′-GCAGGGGGAAGTAGTTCAAATCC-3′, reverse primer 5′-TGTGCCAGTCAAGGGACACG-3′; Pea3 (150 bp), forward primer 5′-GCCCCGCCACCTTAGTTGTG-3′, reverse primer 5′-GCACTCGCTGGTCCAAGTATCC-3′; TTF-1 (187 bp), forward primer 5′-GTTCCAGAACCACCGCTACA-3′, reverse primer 5′-GGGTTTGCCGTCTTTGACTA-3′, β-actin (350 bp), forward primer 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′, reverse primer 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′, L32 (257 bp), forward primer 5′-GTGAAGCCCAAGATCGTC-3′, reverse primer 5′-AGCAATCTCAGCACAGTAAG-3′.FIGURE 3Erm expression is enhanced by FGFs in vitro. E11.5 tracheal epithelium cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing insulin, transferrin, cholera toxin, epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, FGF1, and FGF7 showed widespread hybridization with an antisense Erm probe (A), whereas a sense probe gave no signal (B). Induction of SP-C also occurred in these cultures (C), and the pattern of expression was identical to that seen for Erm. Equivalent amounts of input cDNA from E11.5 tracheal epithelial rudiments cultured in the presence or absence of FGF1 and FGF7 were analyzed in parallel real-time PCR reactions. In one set, all reactions were terminated when the highest expressing sample(s) reached a plateau and run on a gel to give the qualitative image shown here (D) that accurately reflects the real-time PCR data. Elimination of FGFs from the medium (–FGFs lane) ablated expression of SP-C and reduced Erm expression by 67%. β-actin, Pea3, and TTF-1 expression were unaffected by the absence of FGFs. Controls containing no template cDNA (H2O) gave no signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4Inhibition of FGF signaling decreases Erm expression in vitro and in vivo. E12.5 lungs (A) cultured in medium containing Me2SO (B) continued to branch; note the increase in buds in the right middle lobe (arrow, B). Whereas treatment with the FGFR antagonist SU5402 completely blocked further branching (C), individual lobes appeared to continue elongating (arrow, C). Lungs from E13.5 wild-type fetuses (D) showed extensive branching, with many distal tips; only the left lung (LL) is shown here. In contrast, lungs from mice expressing FGFR-HFc (E), a soluble dominant-negative FGFR, were severely hypoplastic, and the left lung (LL) had few distal tips. Similarly, mice expressing the FGF antagonist Spry-4 (F) in the epithelium were hypoplastic and showed little branching. Note that the lack of lateral branching in the epithelium in lungs from mice expressing FGFR-HFc or Spry-4 results in an elongated appearance, similar to that seen in SU5402-treated explants (C). Equivalent amounts of input cDNA from the lungs of normal and transgenic fetuses and from lung explant cultures were analyzed in parallel real-time PCR reactions. In one set, all reactions were terminated when the highest expressing sample(s) reached a plateau and run on a gel to give the qualitative image shown here (G) that accurately reflects the real-time PCR data. Lungs from wild-type E13.5 fetuses expressed both Erm and SP-C. The lungs of fetuses expressing FGFR-HFc or Spry-4 expressed both Erm and SP-C but at lower levels (∼65 and ∼80% decreases, respectively). E12.5 lungs cultured for 24 h in medium containing 0.1% Me2SO expressed Erm and SP-C at levels similar to those seen in E13.5 lungs. Treatment with the FGFR antagonist SU5402 decreased expression of Erm by 83% and SP-C by 92%. Control PCR reactions that contained no template (H2O) were negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Situ Hybridization—The 2.2-kb mouse cDNA for the 3′-untranslated region of Erm contained in IMAGE clone IM2645600 (Invitrogen) and the 758-bp cDNA for mouse SP-C (12Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) were used as templates for generating riboprobes. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were used for whole mount in situ hybridization (22Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization, A Practical Approach. 1992; (IRL Press, New York): 75-83Google Scholar), and riboprobes labeled with [33P]UTP were used for tissue section in situ hybridization (7Deterding R.R. Shannon J.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2963-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Double-stranded wild-type oligonucleotide 1 (–132 to –113) and oligonucleotide 2 (–207 to –188) (Fig. 5A), each of which contains one of the two consensus Ets binding sites present in the 320-bp SP-C promoter, were end-labeled with γ-[32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA were performed as described elsewhere (23Bachurski C.J. Kelly S.E. Glasser S.W. Currier T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32759-32766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For antibody supershift assays, 2 μl of goat anti-Erm antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or control IgG were added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 20 min. The DNA-protein complex was separated from free probes by nondenaturing electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Erm and TTF-1 Co-precipitation Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from JEG-3 cells 48 h after co-transfection with the expression plasmids pErmFLAG and/or pCMV-TTF-1; in one set of controls pErmFLAG was omitted from the transfection. The nuclear extracts were incubated with 10 μl of a rabbit polyclonal Erm antibody (Santa Cruz) or normal rabbit serum (as a control) and protein G-Sepharose beads in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/μl Bacitracin, 1 mm o-phenanthroline) overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with immunoprecipitation buffer minus Triton X-100, the beads were boiled in Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of a monoclonal TTF-1 antibody (24Holzinger A. Dingle S. Bejarano P.A. Miller M.A. Weaver T.E. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mammalian Two-hybrid System Assays—The plasmid constructs pVP16/Erm-AD and pM/TTF-1-BD (hereafter AD/Erm and BD/TTF-1) were made by subcloning the coding sequences of Erm and TTF-1 into the vectors pVP16 and pM (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. The reporter construct pG5Luc, which contains the luciferase gene downstream of five GAL4 DNA binding sites and the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter (25Naltner A. Ghaffari M. Whitsett J.A. Yan C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 56-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. C. Yan (Cincinnati Children's Hospital). Erm deletion constructs, which included the N-terminal (Em-N), acidic (Em-AD), Ets (Em-Ets), and C-terminal (Em-C) domains as well as the Ets plus C-terminal (Em-ΔN), were generated by PCR and subcloned into pVP16 vector between EcoRI and XbaI sites. All constructs were sequenced, and no mutations were detected. TTF-1 deletions were excised from previously generated TTF-1 domain constructs in pVP16 (26Liu C. Glasser S.W. Wan H. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4519-4525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pMBD vector between EcoRI and XbaI sites. JEG-3 cells were transfected with 300 ng/well of the paired AD/Erm and BD/TTF-1 chimeric plasmids along with 180 ng/well of pG5Luc and 20 ng/well of pRL-TK. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed by luminometry as described above. Adult Type II Cell Culture and Transfection with siRNAs—Adult mouse type II cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum were prepared as previously described (27Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and seeded onto Matrigel in 12-well dishes. Non-adherent cells were removed after 24 h, and the cells were switched to BEGM medium (Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) minus hydrocortisone but additionally containing 5% rat serum and 12.5 ng/ml FGF7 (PreproTech). Cells were then transfected with 400 ng of siRNA targeting bases 194–214 (5′-AAGUUCCUGAUGAUGAGCAGU-3′) of Erm using Gene Silencer reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Sham-transfected cells and cells transfected with an equal amount of a Cy3-labeled siRNA targeting luciferase (Cy3luc; Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) served as controls. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection, and expression of Erm, SP-C, β-actin, and GAPDH was determined by real-time PCR. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Comparisons among groups were made by one-way analysis of variance using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. Data are presented as the means ± S.E., with p < 0.05 considered significant. Erm Is Expressed in Lung Epithelium—Using cDNA microarray analysis, we identified Erm, a member of the Ets transcription factor family, as differentially expressed in the E11.5 lung versus the trachea (17Lin S. Shannon J.M. Chest. 2002; 121: 80S-81SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In situ hybridization showed that Erm was expressed in both lung and tracheal epithelium on day E10.5 (Fig. 1A) but was restricted to the lung epithelium by E11.5 (Fig. 1B), an observation that was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Erm became progressively more restricted to the distal lung epithelium on days E13.5 (Fig. 1C) and E16.5 (Fig. 1D). In the adult lung we observed that Erm was expressed exclusively in alveolar type II cells (Fig. 1, E and F) but not in more proximal epithelial cell types, an expression pattern identical to that seen for SP-C (12Wert S.E. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 28Kalina M. Mason R.J. Shannon J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 6: 595-600Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The co-localization of SP-C and Erm in the adult lung was underscored by the fact that expression of both genes was similarly enriched in freshly isolated alveolar type II cells when compared with whole lung by real-time PCR (6.1- and 7.7-fold increases for Erm and SP-C, respectively; n = 4). We did not detect Pea3 in adult type II cells by reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). Erm Expression Is Associated with the Distal Lung Epithelial Cell Phenotype—Like Erm, SP-C is not expressed in the tracheal epithelium at stage E11.5 or later. We have previously shown, however, that embryonic tracheal epithelium can be reprogrammed by lung mesenchyme to express morphological, biochemical, and molecular markers of differentiated distal lung epithelium, including SP-C (3Shannon J.M.

https://openalex.org/W1967214802,"MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP are leukemogenic fusion proteins associated with therapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia. These proteins are thought to subvert normal gene expression in differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have previously shown that MOZ-TIF2 inhibits transcription by CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300-dependent activators such as nuclear receptors and p53. Here we have shown that MOZ-TIF2 associates with the RARβ2 promoter in vivo, resulting in altered recruitment of CBP/p300, aberrant histone modification, and down-regulation of the RARβ2 gene. In contrast, MOZ-TIF2 up-regulated transcription mediated by the MOZ/MYST3-dependent activator AML1/RUNX1. Both wild type MOZ and MOZ-TIF2 were found to colocalize with AML1, and MOZ-TIF2 was recruited to an AML1 target promoter. A MOZ-CBP fusion protein showed similar functions to MOZ-TIF2 in that it inhibited retinoic acid receptor-mediated transcription but enhanced AML1 reporter activation. Although it contains almost the entire CBP sequence, MOZ-CBP does not appear to associate with PML bodies. In summary, our results indicate that leukemogenic MOZ fusion proteins have differential effects on the activities of CBP-dependent and MOZ-dependent activators because of their ability to alter cofactor recruitment and chromatin modification at target promoters.

Genes identified at the breakpoints of these translocations include transcriptional regulators such as the DNA binding transcription factor AML1 and/or genes encoding transcriptional cofactors or chromatin modifiers such as MLL, CBP/p300, MOZ, MORF, and TIF2. Oncogenic fusion proteins resulting from these events are likely to cause both global and promoter-specific alterations in chromatin modification, thus perturbing gene expression programs required for myeloid differentiation, leading to leukemia.Chromosomal translocations that fuse the gene encoding the histone acetyltransferase MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein; also known as MYST3 or ZNF220) with genes encoding the nuclear receptor coactivators CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300 or TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor) are associated with M4/M5 subtypes of AML (1Aguiar R.C.

The CBP-binding domain (AD1) of MOZ-TIF2 was found to be required to extend the proliferative potential of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and induce AML in vivo (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J.

Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that MOZ-TIF2 interacts directly with CBP in vivo and as a consequence inhibits transcription by p53 and nuclear receptors, including the retinoic acid receptors (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression of MOZ-TIF2 in hematopoietic progenitors and various cell lines depletes cellular levels of CBP protein and mislocalizes CBP from PML bodies. Thus, the expression of genes that require CBP/p300 function, such as retinoic acid receptor target genes, are likely to be adversely affected.MOZ has been shown to acetylate histones in vitro (11Champagne N. Bertos N.R. Pelletier N. Wang A.H. Vezmar M. Yang Y. Heng H.H. Yang X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28528-28536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Champagne N. Pelletier N. Yang X.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 404-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be associated with a multiprotein complex containing AML1 (Runx1/CBFA2/PEBP2αB) and CBFβ, which are important regulators of hematopoiesis (9Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exogenously expressed MOZ was reported to enhance transcriptional activation by Runx family proteins such as AML1 and Runx2 (9Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Bristow C.A. Shore P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas a fusion protein resembling MOZ-CBP repressed AML1 activity (9Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7184-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether AML1 transcriptional activity is adversely affected by MOZ-TIF2 or whether MOZ-TIF2 can associate with AML1.To further understand the molecular mechanisms of MOZ-TIF2 inhibition of CBP-dependent gene expression, we have examined the effect of MOZ-TIF2 on histone modification and coactivator recruitment at the RARβ2 gene promoter in vivo. We also investigated whether MOZ and MOZ fusion proteins can modulate the transcriptional activity of AML1. Our results indicate that MOZ fusion proteins have differential effects on CBP/p300-dependent or MOZ-dependent activators, which may have important implications for the pathogenesis of these proteins in AML.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Plasmids—Expression vectors (based on pcDNA3.1) for epitope-tagged MOZ, MOZ-TIF2, TIF2, MOZ-N, and MOZ-TIF2ΔAD1 have been described previously (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged MOZ G657E and MOZ-TIF2ΔH/PHD (deleting amino acids 63–240) constructs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR, and the FLAG-MOZ-CBP expression vector was made by PCR generation of a HindIII site in the MOZ sequence to allow in-frame ligation of fragments released from existing vectors (MOZ-(1–1117) and CBP-(28–2004)). The pcDNA4/TO YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 construct was generated by ligation of a NheI/XbaI fragment into a modified pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen). The following plasmids were obtained as gifts: pT109 (3xAML1-luc), pRep4-RARE-Luc (A. Zelent), pcmv5-AML1b (D. E. Zhang), and pRARβ2-luc (G. Folkers).Antibodies—For Western blotting and immunofluorescence, the following primary antibodies were used: anti-AML1 N20, anti-CBP A22 (Santa Cruz), anti-acH3K9, anti-acH3K14 (Upstate), anti-α-tubulin, anti-β-actin, anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-GFP (Abcam), and anti-HA (Roche Applied Science). Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase, anti-mouse IgG peroxidase, anti-goat IgG peroxidase (Santa Cruz), anti-goat IgG Alexa Fluor 594, anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 594, and anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies used in ChIP assays were anti-RARα, anti-RARβ, anti-RARγ, anti-p300 N15, anti-MOZ N19 (Santa Cruz), anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-GFP (Abcam), anti-CBP CT, anti-AML1 ab-1 (Calbiochem), anti-diMeH3R17, anti-diMeH4R3, anti-acH3K9, anti-acH3K14, and anti-acH4K8 (Upstate).Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—U2OS and COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine at 5% CO2. For AML1 reporter assays, U2OS cells were seeded 6 h prior to transfection in 12-well plates, and the cells were transiently transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase reporter pCH110, 500 ng of the AML1-responsive reporter pT109-luc, 100 ng of AML1, and the indicated amounts of MOZ expression plasmids and variants thereof where applicable, along with empty vector to standardize the quantity of DNA in each well. For nuclear receptor (NR) transient transfections, COS-1 or U2OS cells were seeded 6 h prior to transfection in 12-well plates, and the cells were transiently transfected with 100 ng of β-galactosidase reporter pCH110, 500 ng of luciferase reporter (RARE-luc, RARβ2-luc, or p(Gal4)5-E1bΔ-luc), expression vectors (100 ng unless otherwise stated), and empty vector to standardize the quantity of DNA in each well. In the case of p(Gal4)5-E1bΔ-luc, fresh medium containing 10–7 m all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) or vehicle was added 24 h post-transfection and the cells incubated for an additional 24 h before harvesting. Transfections were carried out using the CalPhos™ mammalian transfection kit (Clontech), and cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed as follows. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (Dual Light® system kit; Applied Biosystems); 5 μl of extract were assayed (in duplicate) for luciferase activity and the results normalized using β-galactosidase activity.Immunofluorescence—Cells were plated onto coverslips in 6-well plates at 1–3 × 105 cells/well and transfected 24 h later using TransFast (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were washed, and after blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with primary antibodies (1:50 dilution for AML1b, 1:200 for FLAG, and 1:10 for CBP). After 1 h of incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:500 dilution). DNA was stained using 0.5 μg/ml of Hoechst 33258. The samples were viewed using a confocal microscope (LSM510 Meta; Zeiss).Generation of a Stable Cell Line for Inducible Expression of MOZ-TIF2—U2OS TREx cells (which contain the regulatory plasmid pcDNA6/TR) were transfected with 2.5 μg of pcDNA4/TO YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 using TransFast. After 48 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's complete medium that contained antibiotics (400 μg/ml of Zeocin™ and 200 μg/ml of Hygromycin) in order to select cells that contain both the regulatory plasmid (pcDNA6/TR) and the inducible plasmid (pcDNA4/TO YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2). The cells were maintained with antibiotics at all times. Once cells were selected, YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 was induced by incubation with 2 μg/ml of doxycycline for up to 5 days. Because of the short half-life of doxycycline (48 h), the appropriate amount of doxycycline was added every 2 days.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed essentially as described (14Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). In brief, U2OS-TRex cells (referred to as U2OST) or U2OST with stably integrated MOZ-TIF2 DNA (referred to as U2OST-MT2) were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum for 72 h. For ChIP studies of the RARβ2 promoter, cells were treated overnight with ATRA (unless otherwise stated) at a final concentration of 10–7 m. The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1.5 ml of collection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 100 mm dithiothreitol), and then placed on ice for 15 min and incubated for a further 15 min at 30 °C. The cells were then collected and washed with 1.5 ml of buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5) and then with buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). The cells were resuspended in 350 μl of ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5%), supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and sonicated twice for 15 s on and 30 s off at power setting 12 μ (yielding fragments of 200–1000 bp). DNA content was determined by measuring the OD 260/280, and 25 μg of DNA were used for each immunoprecipitate. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 10 μg of a specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice for 10 min with TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and once with buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The immunoprecipitate was eluted by incubation in 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) for 30 min. The supernatants were combined and the cross-link reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified through QIAquick PCR purification kit eluting into 50 μl of H2O. 1 μl of DNA was used in a 25-μl PCR reaction. Primers were designed to amplify the region –383 to –31, which contains a COUP-TF binding site, the canonical RARE, and the TATA box, to detect recruitment of factors at the endogenous RARβ2 promoter. For ChIP studies of the AML1 reporter, U2OST-MT2 cells were transfected with pT109-luc and an AML1 expression vector prior to induction of MOZ-TIF2 with doxycycline. ChIP assays were performed as outlined above, and primers were designed to amplify a 249-bp fragment containing the three AML1 binding sites in pT109-luc. PCR reactions were replicated several times and samples analyzed after 25–35 cycles to optimize the signal:noise ratio.RESULTSMOZ-TIF2 Alters Cofactor Recruitment at the RARβ2 Promoter—We have previously demonstrated that MOZ-TIF2 inhibits the transcriptional activity of CBP-dependent activators such as RARs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, and p53 in a variety of cell lines, including human embryonic kidney 293, U2OS, SaOS2, and U937 cells (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This inhibition of transcription factor activity is dependent on the interaction of the MOZ-TIF2 AD1 domain with CBP. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying MOZ-TIF2 action, we generated a stable U2OS cell line enabling the inducible expression of YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 in vivo. We have previously confirmed that YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 behaves in a similar fashion to MOZ-TIF2 in terms of subcellular localization, protein interactions, and transcriptional inhibition (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Stable hygromycin/zeocin-resistant cells that displayed inducible expression of YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 upon treatment with 2 μg/ml of doxycycline for 2–5 days were selected for further experiments (see Fig. 1C).Initially, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were optimized in U2OST cells to assess the effects of ATRA on recruitment of retinoic acid receptors and CBP/p300 to the RARβ2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 1A, RARα and RARβ were found to be associated with the RARβ2 promoter, both in the presence and absence of ligand. This is consistent with a recent report that, in P19 cells, RARα was bound to the RARβ2 promoter in the absence of cognate ligand, leading to corepressor recruitment and gene repression (15Pavri R. Lewis B. Kim T.K. Dilworth F.J. Erdument-Brumage H. Tempst P. de Murcia G. Evans R. Chambon P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RARγ was also detected on the RARβ2 promoter but only after treatment of the cells with ATRA, and Western blot analysis revealed that this isoform is expressed at very low levels in U2OST cells (data not shown). Similarly, by reducing the number of PCR cycles, we observed that ATRA enhanced recruitment of RARβ protein to the RARβ2 promoter (data not shown), although our data clearly indicate that RARs are constitutively associated with the proximal promoter of the RARβ2 gene. We also examined the effect of ATRA treatment on recruitment of histone acetyltransferases. As shown in Fig. 1A, ATRA treatment strongly induced the association of CBP and p300 proteins with the RARβ2 promoter, consistent with similar analyses in P19 cells (15Pavri R. Lewis B. Kim T.K. Dilworth F.J. Erdument-Brumage H. Tempst P. de Murcia G. Evans R. Chambon P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 83-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).To test the effect of MOZ-TIF2 on transcription from the RARβ2 promoter, we first performed reporter assays on extracts from U2OS cells co-transfected with MOZ-TIF2 and a RARβ2-luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 1B, reporter activation was inhibited by MOZ-TIF2 in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the RARβ2 promoter is down-regulated by MOZ-TIF2, consistent with our previous studies (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The induction of YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 expression in doxycycline-treated U2OST-MT2 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR, using primers specific for the fusion junction (data not shown). Consistent with this, YFP-positive cells were detectable 12 h post-doxycycline treatment, although prolonged exposure of up to 5 days was required to detect YFP in >60% of cells. The induced cells displayed YFP proteins in the nucleus in a mesh-like distribution typical for MOZ-TIF2 (Fig. 1C). Western blots confirmed the detection of the recombinant fusion protein at the expected molecular weight (Fig. 1C).Next, we used ChIP assays to assess whether promoter occupancy in the presence and absence of ATRA was similar in U2OST and U2OST-MT2 cells cultured in the absence of doxycycline, i.e. under conditions where MOZ-TIF2 was not expressed. As expected, RARα and RARβ were constitutively bound to the RARβ2 promoter (data not shown). In the absence of doxycycline (and therefore MOZ-TIF2), CBP was not detected on the RARβ2 promoter but was recruited in a ligand-dependent manner, (compare 0, 2, and 24 h ATRA treatment; Fig. 1D, upper right panel). However, in cells expressing MOZ-TIF2 (treated with doxycycline for 12 h), CBP was already found to be present on the promoter even in the absence of ATRA, albeit at lower levels. Paradoxically, treatment of these cells with ATRA led to a decrease in CBP levels detected at the RARβ2 promoter (Fig. 1D, upper right panel), which is consistent with our previous observations (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for both CBP and p300 where U2OST-MT2 cells were treated with doxycycline for 5 days to obtain maximal MOZ-TIF2 expression (Fig. 1D, lower panel). Thus, we conclude that MOZ-TIF2 expression can perturb the strict ligand-dependent recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to the RARβ2 promoter.To determine whether the MOZ-TIF2 protein itself can associate with the RARβ2 promoter in the U2OST-MT2 cells, ChIP assays were performed using an antibody recognizing the N terminus of MOZ. As shown in Fig. 1E, MOZ proteins were detected at the RARβ2 promoter in U2OST-MT2 cells treated with doxycycline. Although the antibody used will recognize both wild type and MOZ fusion proteins, the enhanced signal obtained in extracts from cells treated with doxycycline strongly suggests that the MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein is bound to the amplified region. To distinguish between endogenous MOZ proteins and recombinant YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2, we also performed ChIP assays using antibodies that recognize the YFP and HA tags that confirmed that YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 associates with the RARβ2 promoter region (Fig. 1E). However, in cells treated with ATRA the association of YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 with the RARβ2 promoter was reduced. Thus, ATRA treatment appears to result in lower levels of promoter-bound MOZ-TIF2 and associated CBP and p300 proteins, and our results indicate a correlation between MOZ-TIF2 and CBP/p300 occupancy on the RARβ2 promoter. In a previous study, we demonstrated that CBP levels are depleted in hematopoietic progenitor cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing MOZ-TIF2 (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M.

Western blots confirmed that cellular CBP levels were reduced in U2OST-MT2 cells treated with doxycycline (Fig. 1F), and longer exposure revealed that CBP was further reduced in the presence of ATRA (Fig. 1G). In contrast, MOZ-TIF2 expression did not alter the ligand-dependent association of RARs with the RARβ2 promoter (data not shown), consistent with its inability to interact directly with nuclear receptors (7Kindle K.B. Troke P.J. Collins H.M. Matsuda S. Bossi D. Bellodi C. Kalkhoven E. Salomoni P. Pelicci P.G. Minucci S. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 988-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).MOZ-TIF2 Alters Histone Modification at the RARβ2 Promoter—Wild type MOZ protein has previously been shown to acetylate histones H3 and H4 in vitro (11Champagne N. Bertos N.R. Pelletier N. Wang A.H. Vezmar M. Yang Y. Heng H.H. Yang X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28528-28536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Champagne N.

Induced expression of YFP-HA-MOZ-TIF2 in U2OST-MT2 cells increased bulk acetylation of H3, as detected using antibodies specific for acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 (Fig. 2A). ChIP assays were performed in the U2OST-MT2 cells to assess the effects of MOZ-TIF2 on histone modification at the RARβ2 promoter. In the absence of MOZ-TIF2, ATRA was found to induce acetylation of histones H3K9, H3K14, and H4K8 (Fig. 2B), which may be due in part to recruitment of CBP/p300. In addition, arginine methylation of H3R17 and H4R3 was increased after ATRA treatment, and it has been demonstrated in studies of other promoters that these modifications are mediated by the arginine methyltransferases CARM1 and PRMT1, respectively.FIGURE 2MOZ-TIF2 alters histone modification.

Levels of β-actin are shown as protein loading controls. B, ChIP experiments were performed on U2OST-MT2 cells grown in the presence (+) or absence (–) of ATRA. Histone modification at the RARβ2 promoter was studied in the presence or absence of MOZ-TIF2 (+ or – doxycycline). The effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (500 nm for 6 h) on the level of H3K9 acetylation is also shown (lower panel). C, ligand-independent activation of RARE-luc.

This altered chromatin modification appears to be specific, as in contrast, we did not observe an increase in acetylation of H4K8 in the absence of ligand. In addition, cells expressing MOZ-TIF2 displayed increased dimethylation of H3R17 and H4R3 compared with control both in the absence or presence of ATRA. This may be due to recruitment of CARM1 and PRMT1 proteins to the TIF2 AD2 domain that is present in the fusion protein. However, ChIP assays performed with antibodies against CARM1 were not successful (data not shown); therefore, it remains to be determined whether MOZ-TIF2 recruits CARM1 or PRMT1 to the RARβ2 promoter.Although MOZ-TIF2 induced ligand-independent acetylation of H3K9 or H3K14, treatment of cells expressing MOZ-TIF2 with ATRA did not lead to further increases in acetylation of H3K9 or H3K14. Indeed, under the conditions used, the levels of acetylation achieved in cells expressing MOZ-TIF2 were equivalent to those obtained by treatment of U2OST-MT2 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (Fig. 2B, lower panel). However, H4K8 acetylation, which was not enhanced by MOZ-TIF2, remained ATRA dependent (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that MOZ-TIF2 perturbs specific histone modifications at the RARβ2 promoter such as H3K9, H3K14, H3R17, and H4R3, whereas others are unaffected. As previous studies have detected no differences in substrate preferences of MOZ and MOZ fusion proteins (9Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoya"
https://openalex.org/W2073092895,"Protein kinase D (PKD) isoforms are protein kinase C (PKC) effectors in diacylglycerol (DAG)-regulated signaling pathways. Key physiological processes are placed under DAG control by the distinctive substrate specificity and intracellular distribution of PKDs. Comprehension of the roles of PKDs in homeostasis and signal transduction requires further knowledge of regulatory interplay among PKD and PKC isoforms, analysis of PKC-independent PKD activation, and characterization of functions controlled by PKDs in vivo. Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals share conserved signaling mechanisms, molecules, and pathways Thus, characterization of the C. elegans PKDs could yield insights into regulation and functions that apply to all eukaryotic PKDs. C. elegans DKF-1 (D kinase family-1) contains tandem DAG binding (C1) modules, a PH (pleckstrin homology) domain, and a Ser/Thr protein kinase segment, which are homologous with domains in classical PKDs. DKF-1 and PKDs have similar substrate specificities. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) switches on DKF-1 catalytic activity in situ by promoting phosphorylation of a single amino acid Thr(588) in the activation loop. DKF-1 phosphorylation and activation are unaffected when PKC activity is eliminated by inhibitors. Both phosphorylation and kinase activity of DKF-1 are extinguished by substituting Ala for Thr(588) or Gln for Lys(455) (""kinase dead"") or incubating with protein phosphatase 2C. Thus, DKF-1 is a PMA-activated, PKC-independent D kinase. In vivo, dkf-1 gene promoter activity is evident in neurons. Both dkf-1 gene disruption (null phenotype) and RNA interference-mediated depletion of DKF-1 protein cause lower body paralysis. Targeted DKF-1 expression corrected this locomotory defect in dkf-1 null animals. Supraphysiological expression of DKF-1 limited C. elegans growth to approximately 60% of normal length."

Concerned about the large divergence reported for a relatively conserved gene, and the absence of the sequence in any public database, we analysed an additional tissue sample from the specimen and found only 0.6% divergence from S. scrofa. Our more extensive analysis places the sample within the S. scrofa clade, calling into question the species status of S. bucculentus and demonstrating the need for both phylogenetic and morphological evidence in defining species."

Subsequent release from plasma membrane, intracellular transit to organelles, phosphorylation of substrates, and quenching of kinase activity must be precisely orchestrated in time and intracellular space to produce integrated physiological responses to signals carried by DAG. Dissemination and integration of DAG signals are accomplished by the division of tasks among PKD domains. According to one model, C1b alone binds DAG/PMA at the cell surface (21Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), whereas C1a routes PKD to Golgi membranes (22Maeda Y.

Nuclear import of PKD is governed by C1b, but the PH motif mediates nuclear egress (23Rey O. Sinnett-Smith J. Zhukova E. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49228-49235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation loop phosphorylation (catalyzed by PKC) switches on PKD activity (12Iglesias T.

Physiological consequences of coupled PKC-PKD pathways are determined, in part, by the substrate specificity of PKDs. A growing body of discordant evidence challenges current ideas about specific functions of individual PKD domains and, hence, the overall model. For example, recent studies show that: (a) both C1a and C1b (or C1a and C1b preceded by a complete N terminus) are essential for targeting PKD to Golgi membranes (24Hausser A. Link G. Bamberg L. Burzlaff A. Lutz S. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Rey O. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Science. 2002; 295: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); (c) the PH domain is a critical scaffold for a group of signaling proteins (PKCs, Gβγ subunits, tyrosine protein kinases, etc.) that activate PKDs (because these signaling proteins lack common, conserved domains/sequence motifs, it appears that the PH region is polyvalent and multifunctional (9Brandlin I.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); and (e) PKDs regulate physiological functions in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation (30Chen J. Lu G. Wang Q.J.

A possible explanation for observations that diverge from a unifying model is that domains comprising PKDs can accommodate more than one ligand and/or perform multiple tasks, thereby enabling functional flexibility (plasticity). Properties of multitasking domains could be further modulated by (a) cell-specific expression of interacting regulatory molecules, (b) intramolecular binding with isoform-specific segments of PKDs, and/or (c) “induced” plasticity generated by physical interaction with regulatory proteins or higher order molecular complexes in organelles or cytoskeleton. Ultimately, exhaustive characterization of domains in mammalian PKD isoforms will provide stringent testing of these ideas. An approach that synergizes with studies on classical PKDs, involves analysis of conserved and divergent properties of domains in a new member of the PKD family, DKF-1 (66Feng H. Ren M. Wu S.-L. Hall D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DKF-1 mediates DAG signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism that shares conserved signaling molecules, mechanisms, and pathways with mammals. We discovered that DKF-1 has the domain composition and organization as well as the substrate specificity and amino acid sequence conservation expected for an authentic PKD isoform (66Feng H. Ren M. Wu S.-L. Hall D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). DKF-1 is indispensable in vivo for neuromuscular coordination underlying locomotion. In addition, persistent elevation of DKF-1 content markedly reduces post-embryonic cell growth and overall organism size (66Feng H. Ren M. Wu S.-L. Hall D. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17801-17814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thorough studies on domain functions of DKF-1 may yield novel insights into conserved and divergent features of the C1a, C1b, PH, and kinase modules. DKF-1 can be studied facilely in vitro, in intact cultured cells, and in vivo. In principle, this strategy should promote progress in defining strictly conserved domain features, while simultaneously illuminating novel but physiologically crucial tasks governed and enabled by domain plasticity. Here we report that functional plasticity is superimposed on core conserved domain features. This enables the C1a, C1b, and PH domains of DKF-1 to support novel functions and mechanisms. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Thr588 in the kinase domain provides a “switch” and “timer” mechanism that controls DKF-1 activity and concentration when cells receive transient or persistent DAG input signals. DKF-1 Down-regulation—AV-12 (or HEK293) cells that stably express DKF-1 were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm PMA for 18 h (or for otherwise indicated time intervals). Cytosol and particulate proteins were isolated from mammalian cells as stated previously (34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100 was added or omitted from cell lysis buffer as indicated in the legends for Figs. 2, 4, 7, and 8 and under “Results.” Proteins were size-fractionated by electrophoresis in a denaturing polyacrylamide (8% or otherwise indicated) gel as reported previously (35Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BenchMarker™ prestained proteins (9–182 kDa, Invitrogen) or Precision Plus Protein™ (10–250 kDa, Bio-Rad) polypeptides were used as molecular size standards. Western blots of size-fractionated proteins were prepared, blocked, incubated with anti-DKF-1 IgGs (1:1000), and washed as indicated in previous studies (34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y.

Antigen·antibody complexes were visualized and quantified by recording enhanced chemiluminescence signals and utilizing image analysis software (ImageQuant, GE Healthcare) as reported previously (34Hirsch A.H.

A, AV-12 cells were transfected with equimolar amounts of expression plasmids that encode the bombesin BB2 receptor and either WT or doubly mutated (Pro109 to Gly,Phe197 to Gly) DKF-1. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of bombesin peptide for 2 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and WT, or mutant DKF-1 was precipitated with affinity-purified anti-DKF-1 IgGs and protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunopurified DKF-1 and DKF-1(Gly109,Gly197) were assayed for kinase activity as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” 32P-Phosphate incorporated into Syntide-2 was monitored by scintillation counting, and the data were plotted with Prism (GraphPad) software. These experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained in each instance. Representative data are shown. The Ka for activation of DKF-1 by bombesin is 2.5 nm. B, transfected cells expressing bombesin BB2 receptor and DKF-1 were incubated with 100 nm bombesin for the indicated time intervals. Cells were disrupted in buffer lacking detergent and soluble (S) cytosol and particulate (P) membrane fractions were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Samples of cytosolic and membrane proteins were size-fractionated by denaturing electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blot was probed sequentially with anti-DKF-1 IgGs and secondary antibodies coupled to peroxidase. Antigen·antibody complexes were visualized by incubation with Luminol, and chemiluminescence signals were recorded on x-ray film. C, cells described in B were treated with bombesin peptide for the indicated time intervals. Cells were then washed, fixed, permeabilized, and incubated sequentially with anti-DKF-1 IgGs (1:100 relative to antiserum) and secondary antibody tagged with FITC, as described previously (37Chen Q.

D, cells expressing WT DKF-1, DKF-1(Gly109) or DKF-1(Gly197) were incubated with 100 nm bombesin for 2 or 5 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed, WT and variant DKF-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated, and kinase assays were performed as described in A. Data are plotted (GraphPad) as -fold activation above basal activity (minus bombesin). Experiments in B, C, and D were performed three times, and each replicate yielded similar results.

A, Cytosolic (S) and membrane (P) proteins were isolated from cells stably transfected with a DKF-1 transgene. Cells were incubated with 1 μm PMA for the indicated time intervals. The location and levels of DKF-1 were monitored by Western immunoblot analysis using affinity-purified anti-DKF-1 IgGs, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, cells described in A were preincubated with vehicle, a PKC-selective inhibitor (3.5 μm GF109203X), or 30 μm MG132 for 60 min. Subsequently, 1 μm PMA was added to the medium, and incubation was continued for 18 h. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Samples of detergent-soluble proteins (30 μg/lane) were assayed for DKF-1, PKCϵ, or PKCδ content by Western immunoblot analysis. Chemiluminescence signals recorded on x-ray film are shown. C, cells described in A were incubated in the presence (right) or absence (left) of 1 μm PMA. The level and intracellular distribution of DKF-1 were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified anti-DKF-1 IgG as primary antibody (see “Experimental Procedures” and an accompanying article (66Feng H.

D, AV-12 cells stably transfected with a DKF-1 transgene were treated with 1 μm PMA for indicated time intervals. One batch of cells (lane 4) received 10 μm Lactacystin 30 min prior to initiation of phorbol ester treatment. Detergent-soluble proteins were extracted and processed as stated in B. DKF-1 was detected with affinity-purified IgGs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A Western immunoblot is shown.

AV-12 cells that express C-terminal myc-tagged DKF-1 were incubated with vehicle or 1 μm PMA for the indicated time period. To assess possible ubiquitinylation of DKF-1, replicate batches of cells were simultaneously treated with 30 μm MG132 (see labeling in A). A, after incubation, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Affinity-purified IgGs (1.5 μg) directed against myc peptide were added to samples containing 300 μg of detergent-soluble protein and IgG·DKF-1 complexes were isolated as described previously (34Hirsch A.H.

Immunoprecipitated DKF-1 was purified by denaturing electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (35Bregman D.B. Bhattacharyya N. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4648-4656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with affinity-purified primary antibodies directed against DKF-1 (lanes 1–3) or ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) (lanes 4–6). Blots were developed as described previously (34Hirsch A.H. Glantz S.B. Li Y. You Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2131-2134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Glantz S.B. Li Y.

The positions of molecular mass standards are marked on the left. Note that anti-DKF-1 IgGs react weakly with ubiquitinylated antigen (lanes 1–3). The smeared signal, corresponding to multiple forms of polyubiquitinylated DKF-1 (lanes 5 and 6), is a typical result for proteins modified by ligation of ubiquitin to subsets of a large population of target Lys ϵ-amino groups (52Lu Z.

B, a line of transgenic C. elegans that expresses DKF-1-GFP under the regulation of the authentic dkf-1 promoter was established. WT and TG nematodes were disrupted in a French press, and soluble (S) cytosol and particulate (P) membrane fractions were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B shows a Western immunoblot that was probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the GFP moiety in the DKF-1 fusion protein. C, samples of cytosol (S) and Triton X-100-solubilized membrane proteins (P) from WT and TG C. elegans were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP IgGs. Subsequently, DKF-1-GFP·IgG complexes were precipitated with protein G beads. Precipitated proteins were separated by size in a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blot was processed and probed with affinity-purified anti-ubiquitin IgGs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The smeared signal in the second lane corresponds to multiubiquitinylated DKF-1. No signals were obtained in A–C when immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation was performed with preimmune IgGs, anti-GFP IgGs incubated with excess GFP antigen (2 μg), or anti-ubiquitin IgGs incubated with excess ubiquitin (2 μg). To ensure that ubiquitinylated protein was DKF-1 (and not a DKF-1 binding partner), duplicate samples used for C or A were heated for 3 min at 95 °C in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.1% SDS to denature and disrupt protein complexes. Subsequently, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.4% sodium deoxycholate were added to generate mixed micelles (with 0.1% SDS) that would not impair anti-GFP (or anti-myc) IgGs used to precipitate DKF-1 fusion protein. Western immunoblot analysis yielded results indistinguishable from those shown in C and A. D, cells expressing DKF-1(Ser588) were treated with PMA and/or MG132 as described in A. Levels of DKF-1 protein were monitored by Western immunoblot analysis as indicated in A. E, cells expressing the indicated DKF-1 mutants were prepared and assayed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (36Ndubuka C. Li Y. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

In previous studies we have shown that Dbs is a Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor that can activate RhoA and/or Cdc42 in a cell-specific manner. In this current study we have used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to examine the relative contributions of RhoA·PRK and RhoA·ROCK signaling to Dbs transformation. Our analysis indicates that ROCK is activated in Dbs-transformed cells and that Dbs transformation is dependent upon ROCK I activity. In contrast, there appears to be no requirement for PRK activation in Dbs transformation. Dbs transformation is also associated with increased phosphorylation of myosin light chain and stress fiber formation, both of which occur in a ROCK-dependent manner. Suppression of myosin light chain expression by small interfering RNAs impairs Dbs focus formation, thus establishing a direct link between actinomyosin contraction and Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor transformation.

Members of the Rho subfamily of Ras-related GTPases regulate multiple aspects of cellular behavior including cell movement, cell cycle progression, transcriptional activation, and transformation (1Zohn I.M.

Treat. 2004; 84: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Like most GTPases, Rho proteins exist in the cell in two states; a biologically active GTP-bound conformation and a biologically inactive GDP-bound conformation. The ratio of active GTP·Rho to inactive GDP·Rho in the cell is regulated by several families of regulatory proteins. The Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) 4The abbreviations used are: RhoGEF, Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor; MLC, myosin light chain; HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; siRNA, small interfering RNA. bind to inactive GDP·RhoA and facilitate the release of GDP, which provides an opportunity for GTP to bind (3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Conversion of Rho to the inactive state is achieved through intrinsic GTP hydrolysis, which can be accelerated by interactions with GTPase-activating proteins (4Lamarche N. Hall A. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 436-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A third class of regulators, the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors compete with the RhoGEFs for binding to GDP·RhoA and sequester the inactive GTPase in the cytoplasm (5Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although recent studies have begun to reveal the broad assortment of normal biological activities that are regulated by members of the Rho-GEF family, historically the family has attracted the most attention for its role in transformation. Chromosomal rearrangements with breakpoints that fall within BCR and LARG occur in distinct subsets of human leukemias, and overexpression of Clg has been implicated in murine leukemias (6Maru Y. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 73: 308-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Kourlas P.J. Strout M.P. Becknell B. Veronese M.L. Croce C.M. Theil K.S. Krahe R. Ruutu T. Knuutila S. Bloomfield C.D.

Additionally, a large subset of the RhoGEFs has been isolated in screens for proteins whose expression cause deregulated growth in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Typically NIH 3T3 cells that are transiently transfected with oncogenic RhoGEFs fail to undergo contact inhibition when confluence is reached, forming large dense foci that are morphologically distinct. Cell lines that stably express these oncogenic RhoGEFs also exhibit transformation as measured by a variety of parameters including growth in low serum, anchorage independence, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Dbs is a RhoGEF family member that was isolated in a screen for cDNAs whose overexpression cause deregulated growth in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (9Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar, 10Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Like most RhoGEF family members, Dbs contains a tandem DH/PH domain motif that is both necessary and sufficient for Dbs transforming activity (9Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar). DH domains are the catalytic cores of RhoGEFs and contain virtually all of the residues that are required for substrate recognition, binding, and exchange. PH domains have multiple roles in the context of RhoGEF family members (11Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol.

Whereas the role of Rac1 in Dbs transformation remains unclear, mutations that block lipid binding are completely impaired in transformation (16Rossman K.L. Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Rojas R.J. Snyder J.T.

Like many members of the RhoGEF family, Dbs has potent transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells, and this activity has been mapped to the catalytic domain (9Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R.

Mahon, O. O. Olabisi, and I. P. Whitehead, unpublished observations. A recent determination of the crystal structures of Cdc42 in complex with RhoA and Cdc42 has allowed for the design of mutants with more restricted target specificities (18Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An analysis of the biological activity of these mutants has determined that Cdc42 activation is dispensable for Dbs transformation (18Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we are able to detect elevated levels of activated RhoA, but not Cdc42, in stable NIH 3T3 cell lines that express activated Dbs, and competitive inhibitors of RhoA specifically block Dbs transformation. Collectively, these observations suggest that RhoA is a relevant target for Dbs transformation in this cell type. A number of potential target kinases and structural proteins have been described that interact with RhoA and may mediate Dbs transformation. These include ROCK I (20Ishizaki T. Maekawa M. Fujisawa K.

Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). However, the evidence linking particular RhoA effector proteins to the transformation phenotype is still somewhat limited. RhoA mutants that are selectively impaired in their ability to interact with specific effectors have implicated ROCK I but not PRK I in RhoA transformation (30Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In support of this, a pharmacological inhibitor of ROCK I and a genetic inhibitor of its substrate ezrin, both, block transformation by the RhoGEF family members Net and Dbl (31Tran Quang C. Gautreau A. Arpin M. Treisman R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4565-4576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the RhoA(L-63,V-39) mutant interacts efficiently with ROCK I and is competent in transformation but fails to stimulate actin polymerization (30Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This suggests that ROCK I may mediate RhoA transformation independently of its ability to remodel the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this possibility, a recent study suggests that ROCK I can stimulate JNK-mediated transcriptional pathways independently of its ability to regulate actin (32Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Tanos T. Bernard O. Narumiya S. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 29-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Transformation by RhoA has also been linked to transcriptional activation through ROCK I-independent pathways. For example, dominant inhibitors of MKK3 and MKK6, which are responsible for PRK I-mediated activation of p38γ, also block RhoA transformation (33Marinissen M.J. Chiariello M. Gutkind J.S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 535-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggest that ROCK I- and PRK I-mediated signaling may be necessary for RhoA transformation, it is unclear whether these kinases are directly activated in the context of RhoA transformation or are simply cooperating with additional RhoA-mediated signaling pathways in transformation. Because both ROCK I and PRK I have been implicated in RhoA transformation, we wished to determine whether RhoA-mediated activation of either kinase contributes to Dbs transformation. Our analysis of the activation status and cellular distribution of these kinases in Dbs-transformed cells suggests a role for ROCK I, but not PRK I, in Dbs transformation. Consistent with this, pharmacological and genetic inhibitors that target ROCK I impair Dbs transformation. ROCK-mediated hyperphosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) was also observed in Dbs-transformed cells, and siRNA targeted against MLC also impaired Dbs transformation. These observations support a model whereby ROCK-mediated stimulation of actino-myosin contraction contributes directly to Dbs transformation. Molecular Constructs—The pAX142 and pCTV3H mammalian expression vectors have been described previously (9Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721PubMed Google Scholar). pAX142-dbs-HA6 and pCTV3H-dbs-HA6 contain cDNA fragments that encode a transforming derivative of murine Dbs (onco-Dbs) fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (12Whitehead I.P.

The plasmid pCDNA3-Src, which encodes a transforming derivative of murine Src, was provided by C. J. Der. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Transformation Assays—NIH 3T3 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (JRH Biosciences). Primary focus formation assays were performed as described previously (37Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Cells were maintained in growth media for 14 days, and then cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet to visualize foci. To examine a role for ROCK I in transformation, transfected cells were split into six 6-cm dishes, three of which were treated with 10 μm ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Calbiochem). Cell media was changed, and fresh inhibitor was added every 24 h. To generate NIH 3T3 cell lines stably transfected by pCTV3H-dbs-HA6 or its cognate vector, the transfected cells were selected in growth media supplemented with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for 10 days. Multiple drug-resistant colonies were pooled together to establish stable cell lines. Three independent cell lines were established and tested for each construct. GTPase Activation Assay—Affinity purification assays to measure the levels of endogenous GTP-bound RhoA and Cdc42 were performed using the Rho binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-C21) and the Cdc42 binding domain of PAK (GST-PAK) as described previously (17Cheng L.

Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 16 h before harvesting the lysates. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfections and Secondary Focus Formation Assay—Validated siRNA oligonucleotides, which were designed to suppress endogenous ROCK I (Santa Cruz, sc-36432), ROCK II (Santa Cruz, sc-36433), PRK I (Santa Cruz, sc-36262), or MLC (Santa, Cruz, sc-35940) were transfected by SiLentFect™ lipid reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol into NIH 3T3 cells, which were stably transfected by pCTV3H-dbs-HA6 or its cognate vector. Scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz, sc-37007) were also included in the analysis as negative controls. The medium was replaced 5 h after transfection, and cells were cultured in fresh medium for 2 h before they were used to perform a secondary focus formation assay. Secondary focus formation assays were performed as described previously (12Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 103 transfected cells were mixed with 1 × 106 untransfected NIH 3T3 cells and then plated on 60-mm-diameter dishes. Foci were scored after 7 days. Cells from parallel transfections were cultured in fresh medium overnight and then lysed and examined by Western blot analysis. In a parallel assay for growth inhibition, 1 × 102 transfected cells were plated on 60-mm-diameter dishes. Colonies were counted after 7 days. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (11Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). All cells were serum-starved for 18 h before lysis. The following antibodies were used for Western blots as indicated: mouse anti-HA (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc.), rabbit anti-HA (HA-Y11, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-ROCK I (G-6, Santa Cruz), goat anti-ROCK II (C-20, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-PRK I (610686, Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-PRK II (2612, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-phospho-PRK I(Thr-774)/PRK II(Thr-816) (2611, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-actin (C-2, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-RhoA (26C4, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-c-Myc (9E10, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-GST antibody (B-14, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-MKK3 antibody (9232, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-MLC2 antibody (FL-172, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-phospho-MLC2 (3671, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-cofilin (ACFL02, Cytoskeleton), and rabbit anti-phospho-cofilin (hSer3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Protein was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation Analysis—Cellular fractionations were performed as described previously (12Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7759-7770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells that stably express Dbs-HA6 or its cognate vector were serum-starved in Dul-becco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine calf serum for 18 h. Cells were washed by cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and incubated on ice for 30 min with saline containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). Cells were homogenized and then centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, supplemented with 1 m NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mm, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. The pellet was resolved in saline containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The protein concentrations of total, particulate, and supernatant fractions were determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (40 μg) from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, then transferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by Western blot. ROCK I Kinase Assay—The in vitro ROCK I kinase assay was performed as described previously (38Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells that stably express Dbs-HA6 or cognate vector were transiently transfected with 5 μg pCAG-ROCK I. Lysates were collected at 48 h, clarified by centrifugation, and then immunoprecipitated with an agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz). Beads were washed 3 times with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.03% Brij 35, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem). The immunoprecipitate was then split into two parts, one of which was subjected to Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz) to confirm equal expression of Myc-tagged ROCK I. The second fraction was used in an in vitro kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in kinase assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.03% Brij 35. Samples were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 μm cold ATP, 50 ng/μl histone H1 (Calbiochem) and 135 nCi/μl [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to autoradiography. Where indicated, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml recombinant Rat tumor necrosis factor-α (Sigma) for 3 h before harvesting the cells. Three independent experiments were performed on each of two independent cell lines. PRK I Kinase Assay—The in vitro PRK-I kinase assay was performed as described previously (39Zhu Y. Stolz D.B. Guo F. Ross M.A. Watkins S.C. Tan B.J. Qi R.Z. Manser E. Li Q.T. Bay B.H. Teo T.S. Duan W. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells that stably express Dbs-HA6 or cognate vector were transiently transfected with 5 μg of Myc-PRK I. Lysates were collected at 48 h, cleared, and then immunoprecipitated with an agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz). The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of buffer B containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, and proteases, twice with 1 ml of buffer C containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and proteases, and three times with 1 ml of buffer D containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and proteases. Immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with 1 ml of kinase assay buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were then resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay reaction buffer containing 10 μm unlabeled ATP, 50 ng/μl histone H1 (Calbiochem, 382151) and 135 nCi/μl[32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After a 7-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of stop solution (200 mm ATP, 500 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to autoradiography. As indicated, 40 mm arachidonic acid (Sigma, A3555) was added to the kinase assay reaction mix (40Mukai H. Kitagawa M. Shibata H. Takanaga H. Mori K. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Hirao K. Ono Y. Biochem.

Immunostaining—Immunostaining of transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells was performed as described previously (17Cheng L. Mahon G.M. Kostenko E.V. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pAX142-dbs-HA6 using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were replated on coverslips at low cell density 24 h post-transfection. Cells were serum-starved (0.5% serum) for 16–18 h before they were fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol on ice for 10 min. Fixed cells were then permeabilized and blocked in 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. Coverslips were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies for 1 h in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 3% bovine serum albumin and then in secondary antibodies for 1 h in the dark in 0.1% Triton X-100 with 3% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on glass slides using SlowFade Antifade kits (Molecular Probes). Cells were viewed with an Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with an ApoTome-based imaging system (Zeiss). Axial stacks were captured for each cell, and a single axial plane is shown. Images were analyzed using Axiovision software. Immunostaining of F-actin was performed as described above except that cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Where indicated, cells were treated with 10 μm Y-27632 for an additional 6 h of serum starvation. A Dbs Mutant That is Selectively Impaired in RhoA Exchange Activity Shows Reduced Transformation in NIH 3T3 Cells—Recent structural studies have identified the key residues in Dbs that are responsible for promoting exchange activity on RhoA and Cdc42 (18Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 468-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Using this information it is possible to design Dbs mutants that are selectively attenuated in their ability to productively interact with their substrates. For example, the Dbs(L759M/L766M) mutant shows normal exchange activity for RhoA but is completely impaired in Cdc42 exchange (18Cheng L. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Worthylake D.K. Korus M. Sondek J. Whitehead I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because this mutant exhibits normal transforming activity when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells, Cdc42 activation appears to be dispensable for Dbs-mediated transformation in this cell type. A new mutant of Dbs (Dbs(K758A)) was described recently that exhibits an opposite specificity to the Dbs(L759M/L766M) mutant when examined in an in vitro exchange assay (19Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K.
