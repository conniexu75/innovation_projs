https://openalex.org/W2039905869,"Classical conditioning of the eyelid response in the rabbit was used to investigate the neuronal structures mediating basic associative learning of discrete, adaptive responses. Lesions of the ipsilateral dentate-interpositus nuclei, but not of the cerebellar cortex, abolished the learned eyeblink response. Recordings from these nuclei have revealed neuronal responses related to the learning of the response. Stimulating these recording sites produced the eyelid response. The dentate-interpositus nuclei were concluded to be critically involved in the learning and production of classically conditioned responses."

Examination of the mesenteric microcirculation in situ revealed that dietary magnesium deficiency resulted in reduced capillary, postcapillary, and venular blood flow concomitant with reduced terminal arteriolar, precapillary sphincter, and venular lumen sizes. The greater the degree of dietary magnesium deficiency the greater the reductions in microvascular lumen sizes. These findings may provide a rationale for the etiology, as well as treatment, of some forms of hypertensive vascular disease."

https://openalex.org/W1593633078,"Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight, into 3 rats previously fed 1% acetone (v/v) in their drinking water resulted in the appearance in blood serum of 16 +/- 2 nmol of 1,2-propanediol/ml and 8 +/- 1 nmol of 2,3-butanediol/ml. No detectable 1,2-propanediol or 2,3-butanediol was found in the serum of animals after acetone or saline injection without prior addition of acetone to drinking water or in the serum of animals injected with saline after having been maintained on drinking water containing 1% acetone. These data suggest that acetone both acts to induce a critical enzyme or enzymes and serves as a precursor for the production of 1,2-propanediol. It is also clear from these data that chronic acetone feeding plays a role in 2,3-butanediol production in the rat. Microsomes isolated from the liver of animals maintained on drinking water supplemented with 1% acetone contained two previously unreported enzymatic activities, acetone monooxygenase which converts acetone to acetol and acetol monooxygenase which converts acetol to methylglyoxal. Both activities require O2 and NADPH. Prior treatment with acetone increased serum D-lactate from 9 nmol/ml +/- 9 nmol/ml in control animals to 77 +/- 36 nmol/ml in acetone-fed animals after injection with 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight. This is consistent with methylglyoxal being a by-product of acetone metabolism. Two pathways for the conversion of acetone to glucose are proposed, the methylglyoxal and the propanediol pathways. The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion of acetone to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, and the subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-Propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of acetone monooxygenase and acetol monooxygenase by acetone."
https://openalex.org/W2050905927,"Rodent cells transformed by adenovirus 2 (Ad2) express two highly related viral proteins of 289 and 243 amino acids encoded in early region 1A (E1A). Transformation studies were performed with adenovirus mutants that express only one or the other E1A protein. We found that the 289 amino acid protein, which has transcription inducing activity, and the 243 amino acid protein, which has little if any of this activity, were both required to produce the fully transformed phenotype. Expression of either E1A protein induced a partially transformed phenotype. The 243 amino acid protein was particularly important for anchorage independent growth. As found in previous studies with several other E1A mutants, the process of transformation by the mutant that expresses the 243 amino acid protein only was cold-sensitive. While the 289 amino acid protein is the only E1A protein required for efficient viral replication under standard cell culture conditions, the 243 amino acid protein in addition to the 289 amino acid protein was found to be required for efficient viral replication in growth-arrested human cells."

This virus, designated RA-1, elicits a syndrome in neonatal mice that includes neurological disturbances, permanent crippling of limbs, dwarfism, alopecia, blepharitis, ""masking,"" and a rigid curvature of the thoracic spine. Polyclonal antibodies against RA-1 display high virus neutralizing activity and in immunoassays detect reactive antigen in synovial cells from different rheumatoid arthritis patients but not persons with osteoarthritis. Putative parvoviruses isolated from several other rheumatoid arthritis patients are only weakly pathogenic for newborn mice but can generate RA-1 virus-specific antigens in tissues of these animals. It has not been established that RA-1 and existing parvoviruses of mammalian species are related."
https://openalex.org/W2083250206,"The crystalloid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) houses large amounts of HMG CoA reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. The crystalloid ER appears in UT-1 cells, a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells that has been chronically starved of cholesterol as a result of growth in the presence of compactin, an inhibitor of reductase. When cholesterol was provided to UT-1 cells in the form of low density lipoprotein (LDL), the reductase and crystalloid ER were destroyed. This destruction was preceded by an increase in the cholesterol content of crystalloid ER membranes, as judged by a 4- to 8-fold increase in their ability to form complexes with filipin, a cholesterol-binding compound that can be visualized in freeze-fracture electron micrographs. Filipin binding to other membranes was unchanged. Thus insertion of cholesterol into the crystalloid ER membrane may trigger the degradation of reductase and the membrane itself."
https://openalex.org/W1602226366,"Treatment of canine cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles with phospholipase D resulted in a large stimulation (up to 400%) of Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. The phospholipase D treatment decreased the apparent Km (Ca2+) for the initial rate of Nai+-dependent Ca2+ uptake from 18.2 +/- 2.6 to 6.3 +/- 0.3 microM. The Vmax increased from 18.0 +/- 3.6 to 31.5 +/- 3.6 nmol of Ca2+/mg of protein/s. The effect was specific for Na+-Ca2+ exchange; other sarcolemmal transport enzymes ((Na+, K+)-ATPase; ATP-dependent Ca2+ transport) are inhibited by incubation with phospholipase D. Phospholipase D had little effect on the passive Ca2+ permeability of the sarcolemmal vesicles. After treatment with 0.4 unit/ml of phospholipase D (20 min, 37 degrees C), the sarcolemmal content of phosphatidic acid rose from 0.9 +/- 0.2 to 8.9 +/- 0.4%; simultaneously, Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity increased 327 +/- 87%. It is probable that the elevated phosphatidic acid level is responsible for the enhanced Na+-Ca2+ exchange activity. In a previous study (Philipson, K. D., Frank, J. S., and Nishimoto, A. Y. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 5905-5910), we hypothesized that negatively charged phospholipids were important in Na+-Ca2+ exchange, and the present results are consistent with this hypothesis. Stimulation of Na+-Ca2+ exchange by phosphatidic acid may be important in explaining the Ca2+ influx which accompanies the phosphatidylinositol turnover response which occurs in a wide variety of tissues."

This injury is also associated with increased rates of glucose utilization in regions within the dorsomedial pontine tegmentum. Microinjection of carbachol into these regions produced behavioral suppression resembling that following concussion. These data, together with previously published observations on cholinergic responses to brain injury, suggest that concussive unconsciousness may be attributable in part to activation of cholinergic pontine sites."

The untranslated 3' end of this complementary DNA is homologous to two RNA transcripts present in postmeiotic cells of the testis but absent from meiotic cells and from several tissues including brain. The temporal expression of this alpha-tubulin complementary DNA provides evidence for the haploid expression of a mammalian structural gene.

https://openalex.org/W1602969101,"Mechanisms that have been proposed for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination require the utilization of 1 mol of H2O2 for organic binding of 1 mol of iodide. When we measured the stoichiometry of this reaction using thyroid peroxidase or lactoperoxidase at pH 7.0, we consistently obtained a ratio less than 1.0. This was shown to be attributable to catalase-like activity of these enzymes, resulting in unproductive cleavage of H2O2. This catalatic activity was completely iodide-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, the effects of various agents were investigated. The major observations may be summarized as follows: 1) The catalatic activity was inhibited in the presence of an iodine acceptor such as tyrosine. 2) The pseudohalide, SCN-, could not replace I- as a promoter of catalatic activity. 3) The inhibitory effects of the thioureylene drugs, methimazole and carbimazole, on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity were very similar to those reported previously for thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. 4) High concentrations of I- inhibited the catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in a manner similar to that described previously for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. On the basis of these observations and other findings, we have proposed a scheme which offers a possible explanation for iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Compound I of the peroxidases is represented as EO, and oxidation of I- by EO is postulated to form enzyme-bound hypoiodite, represented in our scheme as [EOI]-. We suggest that the latter can react with H2O2 in a catalase-like reaction, with evolution of O2. We postulate further that the same form of oxidized iodine is also involved in iodination of tyrosine, oxidation of thioureylene drugs, and oxidation of I-, and that inhibition of catalatic activity by these agents occurs through competition with H2O2 for oxidized iodine."

The folding of the polypeptide chain has been established and consists of two structural domains. The larger domain consists of eight beta-strand alpha-helix (beta alpha) units arranged in a configuration similar to that found for triose phosphate isomerase, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate aldolase, and pyruvate kinase. The smaller domain forms a loop away from the larger domain but overlapping the larger domain of another subunit so that a tightly bound dimer is formed. The tetramer then consists of two such dimers. The location of the active site in the enzyme has been tentatively identified from studies using a crystal grown from a solution containing the inhibitor xylitol."

https://openalex.org/W1591494572,"Epimerization of D-glucuronosyl residues to L-iduronosyl ones during biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate involves an abstraction of the C-5 hydrogen of the target sugar residue. After inversion, a hydrogen from the medium is reinserted into the uronosyl residue. In the present study, microsomal enzyme prepared from cultured embryonic skin fibroblasts was incubated with dermatan or chondroitin in the presence of 3H2O of high specific activity. Incubation resulted in incorporation of tritium on C-5 of uronosyl residues of the substrates. The rate of the reaction was highest for dermatan. Incubation of the products with chondroitinase ABC released essentially all the tritium. Dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were inactive as substrates, which indicates that epimerization takes place before sulfation. Analyses of the product obtained after incubation of chondroitin in 3H2O-containing medium for different incubation times showed that tritium accumulated first in L-iduronosyl residues. Later, tritium was also found in D-glucuronosyl residues. The reverse situation was observed when dermatan was used as substrate. After extended incubation times, the ratio of D-[3H]glucuronic acid to L-[3H]iduronic acid in both dermatan and chondroitin reached a value of 85/15, which may reflect the equilibrium value. Digestion of labeled chondroitin with chondroitinase AC and oxidation of labeled dermatan with periodate showed that after 96 h of incubation with the epimerase and 3H2O, most of the uronic acid residues had been involved in the reaction. Both products were composed of long blocks of D-glucuronic acid-containing disaccharides interrupted by a few L-iduronic acid-containing disaccharides arranged singly of in clusters of two to three. Reincubation of the 3H-labeled products originating from dermatan or chondroitin with the epimerase resulted in release of tritium, which was linear with time and with increasing protein concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1549926922,"Unidirectional transport (influx and efflux) of adenine nucleotides in rat liver mitochondria was examined using carboxyatractyloside to inhibit rapid exchange of matrix and external adenine nucleotides via the adenine nucleotide translocase. Influx of adenine nucleotides was concentration-dependent. ATP was the preferred substrate with a Km of 2.67 mM and V of the preferred substrate with a Km of 2.67 mM and V of 8.33 nmol/min/mg of protein. For ADP, the Km was 14.7 mM and V was 10.8 nmol/min/mg of protein. Efflux of adenine nucleotides was also concentration-dependent, varying directly as a function of the matrix adenine nucleotide pool size. Any increase in the influx of adenine nucleotides was coupled to an increase in efflux. However, as the external ATP concentration was increased, influx was stimulated to a much greater extent than was efflux. This imbalance suggested that under certain conditions adenine nucleotide movement might be coupled to the movement of an alternate anion such as phosphate. Adenine nucleotide efflux increased as the external phosphate concentration was varied from 0.5 to 4 mM. Also, increasing the external phosphate concentration caused adenine nucleotide influx to decrease, suggesting competition. In the absence of external adenines and phosphate, no efflux occurred. Both adenine nucleotide influx and efflux were depressed if Mg2+ was omitted. Adenine nucleotide efflux in the presence of external phosphate was inhibited much less by lack of Mg2+ than was efflux in the presence of external ATP. This evidence supports a model in which either adenine nucleotides (probably with Mg2+) or phosphate can move across the mitochondrial membrane on a single carrier. Net adenine nucleotide movements can occur when adenine nucleotide movement is coupled to the movement of phosphate in the opposite direction."
https://openalex.org/W1495187283,"The accumulation of translatable acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit mRNA was examined in the BC3H1 muscle cell line in response to serum and cell growth. Relative amounts of alpha-subunit mRNA were quantitated during differentiation by cell-free translation and immunoprecipitation with an alpha-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody. Logarithmically growing cells do not possess cell surface acetylcholine receptors; however, a significant amount of alpha-subunit mRNA is detectable in cells under these conditions. Furthermore, alpha-subunit is synthesized in growing undifferentiated cells at a rate similar to that of differentiated cultures. Following growth arrest of BC3H1 cells, surface receptors are induced to levels greater than 100-fold above that of growing cells. The relative level of translatable alpha-subunit mRNA in differentiated cells, however, is only approximately 4-fold greater than in growing cultures. Induction of alpha-subunit mRNA appears to be reversible since reinitiation of growth in quiescent differentiated BC3H1 cells results in a reduction in relative abundance of this mRNA species to levels comparable to that of undifferentiated cells and the concomitant loss of surface receptors. These results indicate that receptor expression during differentiation is regulated both post-translationally and at the level of receptor subunit mRNA accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W1627247707,"A water-soluble carbodiimide has been used to promote the formation of amide bonds between carboxyl residues on cytochrome b5 and lysyl residues on cytochrome b5 reductase. The visible and UV absorption spectrum of the purified cross-linked complex was identical with the sum of the spectra of the individual enzymes, and the average apparent molecular weight of the complex, determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, was within 12% of the sum of the apparent molecular weights of the two monomeric enzymes, indicating that the cross-linked derivative was a dimer containing one molecule each of cytochrome b5 and cytochrome b5 reductase. When reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, the amphipathic derivative showed substantially reduced Vmax values with the soluble electron acceptors potassium ferricyanide, cytochrome b5 heme peptide and cytochrome c, and with the membrane-bound acceptors amphipathic cytochrome b5 and stearyl-CoA desaturase. The soluble catalytic fragment of the derivative, produced by limited digestion with subtilisin Carlsberg, showed similar decreases in Vmax values with the above soluble acceptors. In contrast, intradimer electron transfer in the soluble fragment, measured by stopped flow spectrophotometry at 2 degrees C was very efficient. Ninety per cent of the cytochrome b5 in the derivative was reduced with a first order rate constant of 51 s-1 upon the addition of NADH; the transfer of electrons from NADH to the reductase FAD prosthetic group, which is known to be the rate-limiting step in the reductase reaction mechanism, proceeded with an apparent rate constant of 57 s-1 under these conditions. These kinetic data show that the enzymes in the complex are cross-linked together at the surfaces involved in protein-protein contacts during electron transfer in an orientation similar to that assumed during electron transfer between the free proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1490341514,"When phosphorylase kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle was activated by phosphorylation and then cross-linked with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene at pH 6.8, dimers of beta subunits were formed that were not observed during cross-linking of nonphosphorylated enzyme under the same conditions. The ability to form these dimers was due to phosphorylation of the beta subunit because when enzyme phosphorylated in the alpha and beta subunits was incubated with a protein phosphatase relatively specific for the beta subunit (Ganapathi, M.K., Silberman, S.R., Paris, H., and Lee, E.Y.C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3213-3217), the ability to form the cross-linked beta dimers was lost. Significant amounts of two complexes also judged to be dimers of beta subunits were observed when nonphosphorylated phosphorylase kinase was cross-linked after preincubation with Ca2+ plus Mg2+ ions, after proteolysis by chymotrypsin, or when it was cross-linked at pH 8.2, three conditions known to stimulate the activity of the nonphosphorylated enzyme. From these results, we conclude that 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene can serve as a structural probe for activated states of phosphorylase kinase. The activation is associated with a conformational change in which two beta subunits either move closer together or have a reactive group on one, or both, of them unmasked. Our results suggest that the diverse mechanisms listed above for stimulating phosphorylase kinase activity cause a common conformational change to occur."

https://openalex.org/W1600859365,"Studies were conducted to define the location of the unique oligosaccharide sequence in heparin that is required for its anticoagulant activity. A heparin fraction with an average molecular weight of 20,000 was linked at its reducing terminus to a Sepharose derivative via an azo bridge. The matrix-linked heparin was subjected to limited degradation with nitrous acid and, after the cleaved segments were removed, the section contiguous with the original reducing terminus was released from the gel by treatment with sodium dithionite. The results of analyses of the products after separation into different molecular weight pools demonstrate that the groups responsible for accelerating the neutralization of thrombin and Factor Xa by antithrombin are located at or near the nonreducing terminus of the heparin chain."
https://openalex.org/W1579138919,"A kinetic self-editing mechanism for correcting errors in the loading of thioester substrates is described for the animal fatty acid synthetase reaction. In the catalyzed reaction, these substrates load competitively on a common phosphopantetheine site, and during each of the eight loading steps the enzyme sites are partitioned between competent and incompetent substrate molecules. The incompetently bound substrate is removed by CoA through reversal of the loading reaction and partitioning again occurs. The loading-unloading cycle is repeated until competent enzyme complex is formed and the reaction proceeds. Furthermore, at each step the loading of a malonyl residue is competitively favored as is the unloading of enzyme-bound acetyl groups. This mechanism is entirely consistent with the recently postulated role (Stern, A., Sedgwick, B., and Smith, S. J. Biol. Chem. (1982) 257, 799-803) of CoA as a co-substrate. Supporting evidence is obtained by monitoring the progress curves of NADPH oxidation by chicken liver fatty acid synthetase in the stopped flow apparatus. At noninhibiting acetyl-CoA, the reaction shows an initial lag period as the result of preferential formation of malonyl-enzyme and time-dependent recycling of the loading step to obtain competent acetyl-enzyme. At a malonyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA ratio of 2:1, the induction time of the reaction is 1.02 +/- 0.05 s at 6 degrees C. It decreases with increasing acetyl-CoA concentration or preincubation of the enzyme with acetyl-CoA which promotes acetyl-enzyme formation but is slightly increased upon preincubation with malonyl-CoA. Increasing acetyl-CoA causes a parallel decrease in steady state cycle time (i.e. the average time required to complete a single malonyl-CoA condensation cycle), suggesting that the latter is limited by the lag period. At inhibitory acetyl-CoA, the steady state cycle time is lengthened due to acetyl-enzyme formation at malonyl-CoA loading steps and to the recycling necessary to obtain competent malonyl-enzyme. A requirement of CoA for the first condensation cycle is unequivocally demonstrated in conventional spectrophometric assays and stopped flow experiments by using phosphotransacetylase and acetyl phosphate as a CoA trap. This requirement at each loading step is normally met by CoA generated through initial loading. At noninhibitory acetyl-CoA, added CoA inhibits the reaction and slightly increases the lag.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1857473280,"A tritium-labeled diazocarbonyl juvenile hormone (JH) analog, (10-[10,11-3H]epoxyfarnesyl diazoacetate, [3H]EFDA), covalently bound to proteins in both hemolymph and ovarian extracts when reaction mixtures were irradiated with UV light. The addition of various concentrations of unlabeled JH III selectively inhibited [3H]EFDA photoattachment to proteins. Using the Scatchard method of analysis, [3H]EFDA bound specifically and with relatively high affinity (KD = 1.5 X 10(-6) M) to a macromolecule in each extract, although nonspecific binding to other molecules was also present (20-50%). To determine if [3H]EFDA bound at the JH III-binding site on the binding proteins, radioactive [3H]JH III or [3H]EFDA was complexed with proteins in the presence of various concentrations of either unlabeled JH III or JH I under equilibrium conditions. The results demonstrated that the natural hormone, JH III, displaced both bound labeled ligands 4.1 +/- 0.5 times better than the homolog JH I. Thus, the photoaffinity label [3H]EFDA bound at the same site on the protein as [3H] JH III. Fluorescent autoradiography of [3H]EFDA-labeled proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis revealed that several proteins in both hemolymph and ovarian extracts bound [3H]EFDA. To determine the specificity of binding, extracts were irradiated with UV light in the presence of unlabeled JH III and [3H]EFDA. The results demonstrated that JH III prevented photoattachment of [3H]EFDA to a major protein in each extract. The molecular weight of these proteins was estimated at approximately 200,000 for both the hemolymph protein and the ovarian protein."
https://openalex.org/W1523890035,HPRTMunich is a mutant form of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase that was isolated from a patient who presented with gout and a partial deficiency of enzyme activity. Profound abnormalities in the catalytic function of HPRTMunich are responsible for the deficiency of enzyme activity in vivo. Tryptic peptides of HPRTMunich were mapped by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography in an attempt to define the precise abnormality in its primary structure. Sequence analysis of aberrant peptides localized the structural alteration in HPRTMunich to residue 103. Several additional findings suggest that the mutation in this variant is most likely a serine to arginine substitution at residue 103. This amino acid substitution lies within the putative hypoxanthine-binding site of human hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase possibly explaining its selective effect on intrinsic enzyme activity and binding of hypoxanthine.
https://openalex.org/W1542083935,"We have examined the interaction of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase with the phenylalanine analogs, tryptophan and the diastereomers of 3-phenylserine (beta-hydroxyphenylalanine). Both isomers of phenylserine are substrates for native phenylalanine hydroxylase at pH 6.8 and 25 degrees C, when activity is measured with the use of the dihydropteridine reductase assay coupled with NADH in the presence of the synthetic cofactor, 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. However, while erythro-phenylserine exhibits simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km = 1.2 mM, Vmax = 1.2 mumol/min X min) under these conditions, the threo isomer exhibits strong positive cooperativity (S0.5 = 4.8 mM Vmax = 1.4 mumol/min X mg, nH = 3). Tryptophan also exhibits cooperativity under these conditions (S0.5 = 5 mM, Vmax = 1 mumol/min X mg, nH = 3). The presence of 1 mM lysolecithin results in a hyperbolic response of phenylalanine hydroxylase to tryptophan (Km = 4 mM, Vmax = 1 mumol/min X mg) and threo-phenylserine (Km = 2 mM, Vmax = 1.4 mumol/min X mg). erythro-Phenylserine is a substrate for native phenylalanine hydroxylase in the presence of the natural cofactor, L-erythro-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (Km = 2 mM, Vmax 0.05 mumol/min X mg, nH = 2). Preincubation of phenylalanine hydroxylase with erythro-phenylserine results in a 26-fold increase in activity upon subsequent assay with BH4 and erythro-phenylserine, and hyperbolic kinetic plots are observed. In contrast, both threo-phenylserine and tryptophan exhibit negligible activity in the presence of BH4 unless the enzyme has been activated. The product of the reaction of phenylalanine hydroxylase with either isomer of phenylserine was identified as the corresponding p-hydroxyphenylserine by reaction with sodium periodate and nitrosonaphthol. With erythro-phenylserine, the hydroxylation reaction is tightly coupled (i.e. 1 mol of hydroxyphenylserine is formed for every mole of tetrahydropterin cofactor consumed), while with threo-phenylserine and tryptophan the reaction is largely uncoupled (i.e. more cofactor consumed than product formed). Erythro-phenylserine is a good activator, when preincubated with phenylalanine hydroxylase (A0.5 = 0.2 mM), with a potency about one-third that of phenylalanine (A0.5 = 0.06 mM), while threo-phenylserine (A0.5 = 6 mM) and tryptophan (A0.5 approximately 10 mM) are very poor activators. Addition of 4 mM tryptophan or threo-phenylserine or 0.2 mM erythro-phenylserine to assay mixtures containing BH4 and phenylalanine results in a dramatic increase in the hydroxylation at low concentrations of phenylalanine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1511129662,"The carbohydrate moiety of some glycoproteins influences their secretion and functional properties. We have examined the importance of the oligosaccharide chains of fibrinogen in this regard. Fibrinogen was labeled de novo by the addition to rabbit hepatocyte monolayer cultures of either 3H-amino-acids or [2-3H] mannose, in the presence or absence of tunicamycin, a potent inhibitor of glycosylation. Inhibition of glycosylation, which ranged from 75 to 80%, was determined by incorporation of [2-3H]mannose as quantitated by gel filtration. Synthesis and secretion of fibrinogen were quantitated by 3H-amino-acid incorporation, using anti-fibrinogen immunoaffinity column chromatography of medium and cell homogenates. Tunicamycin did not appreciably inhibit fibrinogen synthesis, as compared to a 30-40% inhibition of overall protein synthesis, determined by incorporation of 3H-amino-acids into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. There was no evidence that secretion of fibrinogen was impaired. Fibrinogen from medium was copurified by adding cold plasma fibrinogen as carrier. Nonglycosylated fibrinogen was found to be functional as demonstrated by incorporation of radioactivity into clots of the copurified material at a rate identical to that of glycosylated fibrinogen. When clotted in the presence of Ca2+ and Factor XIII, cross-linking of glycosylated and nonglycosylated fibrin was demonstrable on fluorography of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, showing disappearance of gamma-chain and appearance of gamma-gamma-dimers."
https://openalex.org/W1572437225,"Calmodulin is a major nerve terminal protein and a potential mediator of calcium-dependent nerve terminal functions. Calcium-dependent calmodulin binding has been reported in secretory membrane preparations including chromaffin granules and crude rat brain vesicles. Here we demonstrate a calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding site on cholinergic synaptic vesicles from electric organ. It is saturable with high affinity (KD = 10 nM; Bmax = 80 pmol/mg). The binding is inhibited by trifluoperazine (I50 = 8 microM) and is at least 1000-fold specific for calmodulin over troponin C. Association and dissociation rates (k = 3.1 X 10(6) M-1S-1; k-1 = 1.3 X 10(-2) S-1) are consistent with the dissociation constant measured at equilibrium. Intact synaptic vesicles bind to calmodulin immobilized on polyacrylamide matrix, suggesting that the binding site is cytoplasmically oriented in the vesicle population. Intact synaptic vesicles bind calmodulin up to 80-fold more effectively than do side fractions from the vesicle purification. The quantitative difference is largely due to latency of binding sites since it disappears when the binding is assayed in detergent. Binding of calmodulin to proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that a subset of nerve terminal and electric organ calmodulin-binding proteins are found in synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1545245178,"The proton NMR spectra of metmyoglobin from the Asian elephant, which has the replacement of glutamine for the usual distal histidine, are reported and analyzed. In the low pH region, we detect two interconvertible forms of the met-aquo-protein whose relative stabilities are independent of pH, but depend strongly on both temperature and solvent isotope composition. As the pH is raised, both species convert to the met-hydroxy form, as found for other myoglobins. The temperature dependence of the heme methyl shifts for both acidic protein forms indicates essentially high spin character for the iron, and the mean heme methyl shifts are interpreted as indicating one form with a very slightly weaker, and the other with a significantly stronger, axial ligand field than for the unique sperm whale met-aquo-myoglobin. The thermodynamic data for the equilibrium between the two species are consistent with differences of one hydrogen bond between coordinated water and the distal glutamine. Models are proposed where one form of the protein has not only the glutamine carboxyl oxygen acting as a hydrogen-bond acceptor, but also the amine group. We conclude that a distal glutamine can act both as a stronger and as a weaker hydrogen-bond acceptor towards coordinated water than the usual distal histidine. The relative rates of conversion of the two met-aquo-myoglobin forms to MetMbOH is found to be consistent with the proposed structures for the two forms."

https://openalex.org/W1624885924,"Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) has been purified 3,500-fold from the plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The purified material exhibited a Km for ornithine of 0.6 mM and Vmax of 20 mumol of CO2 formed per min/mg at 30 degrees C (62 mumol/min/mg at 37 degrees C). It migrated as a single protein and activity species on high pressure liquid chromatography (TSK-3000) in 0.15 M NaCl (Mr = 80,000) and in native gels containing 5, 6.5, 8, and 9.5% acrylamide. A single protein band (Mr = 43,000) was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Activity was lost upon incubation with alpha-difluoromethyl[5-14C] ornithine, and the inactivated material appeared as a single Mr = 43,000 14C-band on autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The decarboxylase activity was specific for ornithine and was pyridoxal-P-dependent. The Km for pyridoxal-P (10 microM) was identical with the Kd for pyridoxal-P binding determined from the quenching of protein fluorescence (lambda ex = 282 nm, lambda em = 350 nm, maximal quenching 81%). Using specific antibody obtained from rabbit hyperimmune serum as a probe, an Mr = 43,000 immunoreactive species was detected on nitrocellulose blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of plasmodial homogenates and all pooled purification fractions, but no higher molecular weight cross-reactive material was detected."
https://openalex.org/W1599033791,"The ability of the 5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone analog, 4-aza-4-methyl-5 alpha-pregnane-3,20-dione (AMPD), to inhibit the progesterone 5 alpha-reductase and the two 5 alpha-dihydroprogesterone 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activities (NADH- and NADPH-linked) from female rat hypothalamus has been studied. Dose response experiments indicate that AMPD is a potent antagonist of hypothalamic progesterone 5 alpha-reduction but is an ineffective inhibitor of the NADPH- and NADH-linked 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activities, even at concentrations up to 10 microM. Kinetic analyses of the interaction of AMPD with the progesterone 5 alpha-reductase show that it is a competitive inhibitor versus progesterone (Ki(slope) = 6.2 +/- 0.5 nM; apparent Km (progesterone) = 130 +/- 12 nM) and an uncompetitive inhibitor versus NADPH (Ki(intercept) = 11.8 +/- 0.8 nM). These inhibition patterns are consistent with the concept that NADPH binding precedes that of either AMPD or progesterone. The inhibition of the progesterone 5 alpha-reductase by AMPD does not appear irreversible since preincubation of the enzymatic activity (at 37 degrees C) with inhibitor and NADPH, for periods of time up to 60 min, does not lead to a time-dependent loss of activity. Furthermore, this inhibition can be easily removed via dilution, even following a 60-min preincubation with AMPD and NADPH. It is postulated that the specific and powerful inhibition of the progesterone 5 alpha-reductase by AMPD may be due to this compound functioning as a transition state analog. This inhibitor should prove valuable in studying the characteristics of the progesterone 5 alpha-reductase and the function of hypothalamic progestin metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W1514983354,"Hydroxyproline 2-epimerase of Pseudomonas putida was purified to homogeneity by an improved procedure. The native enzyme consists of two probably identical subunits. Alkylation of the active site with labeled reagents resulted in the loss of 80-85% of the activity but the incorporation of only one alkyl group even though the active site contains a Cys residue from each of the two subunits. This result suggests that the enzyme shows half-site reactivity. The labeled enzyme was further subjected to exhaustive alkylation with unlabeled iodoacetate, permitting tryptic hydrolysis and isolation of an active site peptide in 30% yield. The specific radioactivity of the peptide was consistent with the first result, that only 1 mol of alkyl group was initially incorporated into active site. The active site peptide (14 residues) was sequenced and found to possess homology with the clostridial proline racemase."
https://openalex.org/W1547284249,"The general acyl-CoA dehydrogenase from pig liver mitochondria has been crystallized in a form suitable for detailed three-dimensional x-ray structure analysis. Crystals grown from Tris buffer and polyethylene glycol solution diffract to high resolution and have the space group C2221, a = 128.2, b = 136.1, and c = 106.3 A. A measured crystal density of 1.178 g/cm3 and a crystal volume/unit of molecular mass, Vm = 2.5 A3/dalton, suggest that the asymmetric unit contains two monomers of the tetrameric dehydrogenase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1561540867,"A secondary phenotype of the op3 mutant of RNA bacteriophage f2 is the absence of translational repression of the phage replicase gene by the phage coat protein. We have synthesized RNA fragments corresponding to the site of translational repression for both the wild type and the op3 mutant. Using a quantitative assay, we show that the affinity of the closely related R17 coat protein for the mutant and wild type RNA fragments is the same. In addition, we find that the op3 and R17 coat proteins bind to the wild type RNA fragment with essentially identical dissociation constants. Thus, the altered regulation of replicase protein synthesis in the op3 mutant does not appear to be due simply to a reduced affinity of the translational repressor for its target site."
https://openalex.org/W1586824261,"To study the mode of interaction between hemoglobin (Hb) S and carbamylated Hb S, the kinetics of polymerization of various mixtures of deoxy-Hb S and NH2 termini carbamylated Hb S in concentrated phosphate buffer was determined. These mixtures were found to polymerize with a clear demonstration of a delay time as does each hemoglobin in its pure form. Both the delay and the polymerization times were prolonged as the fraction of carbamylated Hb S was increased. Electrophoretic analysis of the polymer fraction showed that the amount of carbamylated Hb S increased linearly in the polymer phase with increases in the fraction of carbamylated Hb S in the starting mixture. The ratio of Hb S to carbamylated Hb S in the polymer phase was slightly higher than that in the initial solution mixture, suggesting that Hb S polymerizes more easily than carbamylated Hb S. To examine the role of hybrid hemoglobin in the binary mixtures of carbamylated Hb S and Hb S, we compared the rate of polymerization under which hybrid formation may be prevented or allowed to take place. It was found that the rate of polymerization for the mixtures of carbamylated Hb S and Hb S mixed in the oxy state did not differ from that mixed in the deoxy state. In addition, polymerization occurred even when the critical concentration of each component in the mixture was lower than that of either pure Hb S or pure carbamylated Hb S. These results suggest that all hemoglobin species can participate in the nucleation and polymerization steps of mixtures of carbamylated Hb S and Hb S."
