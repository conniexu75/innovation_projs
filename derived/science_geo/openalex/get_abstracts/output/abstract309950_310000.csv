Localization was a different matter: very few believed it at the time, and even fewer saw its importance; among those who failed to fully understand it at first was certainly its author. It has yet to receive adequate mathematical treatment, and one has to resort to the indignity of numerical simulations to settle even the simplest questions about it. Only now, and through primarily Sir Nevill Mott’s efforts, is it beginning to gain general acceptance. Yet these two finally successful brainchildren have also much in common: first, they flew in the face of the overwhelming ascendancy. at the time of the band theory of solids, in emphasizing locality : how a magnetic moment, or an eigenstate, could be permanently pinned down in a given region. It is this fascination with the local and with the failures, not successes, of band theory, which the three of us here seem to have in common. Second, the two ideas were born in response to a clear experimental signal which contradicted the assumptions of the time; third, they intertwine my work with that of my two great colleagues with whom I have been jointly honored; and fourth, both subjects are still extremely active in 1977."
https://openalex.org/W2078428284,The recently developed direct counting technique for radiocarbon atoms has been used to measure the relative numbers of such atoms in various geological samples which had earlier been dated by the beta-ray counting method. Sample weights ranged from 3.5 to 15 milligrams. The dates determined by the two methods are consistent with each other. Further experience with the new method is also reported.
https://openalex.org/W2006898557,A case of aggressive mimicry is described in which an anglerfish of the genus Antennarius (order Lophiiformes) utilizes a lure that mimics a small fish. The lure provides not only a highly attractive visual cue but presumably also a low-frequency pressure stimulus for potential prey with a minimum of energy expenditure.
https://openalex.org/W2006589457,"The variation of concentrations of hydrogen, sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, silicon, and aluminum as a function of depth in the hydration layer of obsidian artifacts has been determined by sputter-induced optical emission. The surface hydration is accompanied by dealkalization, and there is a buildup of alkaline earths, calcium and magnesium in the outermost layers. These results have clarified the phenomena underlying the obsidian hydration dating technique."
https://openalex.org/W2057956467,"The age of a sample of carbon dioxide has been determined by accelerating the carbon with a cyclotron and detecting the carbon-14 ions in the beam. Nitrogen-14 was eliminated as a background through the use of a range-separation technique. To avoid all possibility of experimenter bias, the measurement was conducted in a blind fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2063186992,"Glucans, called elicitors, isolated from cell walls of Phytophthora infestans, caused rapid agglutination and death of protoplasts isolated from potato leaf tissue. Cells incubated with high concentrations of elicitor were rapidly killed, but did not agglutinate. Agglutination and cell death did not occur with any of several commercial polysaccharides including laminarin, but laminarin did inhibit elicitor-mediated agglutination. The results are consistent with the existence of specific elicitor receptor sites on the outer surface of potato leaf plasma membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2025229061,"Intercomparison of radio signals received simultaneously at several sites from several sources with small mutual angular separation provides a powerful astrometric tool. Applications include tracking the Lunar Rover relative to the Lunar Module, determining the moon's libration, measuring winds in Venus's lower atmosphere, mapping Mars radiometrically, and locating the planetary system in an inertial frame."
https://openalex.org/W1969975341,Cholinesterase is found at the sites for mechanoelectric conversion of Pacinian corpuscles; its acetylcholinesplitting activity is of the same order of magnitude as that of the cholinesterase at neuromuscular junctions. The enzyme is not a typical acetylcholinesterase.
https://openalex.org/W2012324350,"Absorptions for the ν2 band of deuterated methane (CH3D) have been observed in the 5-micron spectrum of Saturn, obtained with a Fourier transform spectrometer. Analysis of the band yields a CH3D abundance of 2.6 ± 0.8 centimeter-amagat and a temperature of 175 ± 30 K for the mean level of spectroscopic line formation. This temperature indicates that a substantial portion of Saturn's flux at 5 microns is due to thermal radiation, and that we are therefore looking fairly deep into its atmosphere, as is the case for the Jupiter 5-micron window. This CH3D abundance leads to a deuteriumlhydrogen ratio of about 2 × 10-5 in Saturn's atmosphere. This ratio is much lower than the terrestrial value but comparable to that determined for Jupiter and may be taken as representative of the deuterium/hydrogen ratio in the solar system at the time of its formation."

https://openalex.org/W2031360949,"Internal melt figures can be nucleated in ice without the presence of a vapor bubble. Their form and growth are fracture-like, different from the normal Tyndall stars, which do contain vapor bubbles. Normal Tyndall figures that grow rapidly are not oriented in the basal plane, and very rapid internal melting gives a peculiar, systematic growth of clouds of Tyndall figures."
https://openalex.org/W1997023083,"While considerable progress has been made in dealing with air and water pollution, the earth's natural systems seem in difficulty. Scientific knowledge of environmental matters remains inadequate. A massive effort to promote solar energy and a national commitment to energy conservation are needed. The Clean Air Act has important implications for economic growth, and the Environmental Protection Agency should emphasize flexibility of administration, decentralization, and close cooperation with state and local governments. Expanded use of coal presents major uncertainties in human health and atmospheric effects. Increasing emphasis on chemical pollutants requires better societal perception of risks and benefits. New efforts to avoid confrontation on environmental issues are promising. Finally, the protection of life in all its diversity is today's urgent environmental challenge."

https://openalex.org/W1965189659,"Devonian brachiopods, identifiable at the generic level, have been recovered from calc-silicate rocks more intensely metamorphosed and metasomatized than any other known fossil occurrence. The fossils are a key stratigraphic link between granulite facies rocks of central New Hampshire and fossiliferous rocks of western New Hampshire and Maine."
