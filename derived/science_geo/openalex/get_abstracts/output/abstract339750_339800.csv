https://openalex.org/W2046136706,Calculations of the effects of both natural and anthropogenic tropospheric sulfate aerosols indicate that the aerosol climate forcing is sufficiently large in a number of regions of the Northern Hemisphere to reduce significantly the positive forcing from increased greenhouse gases. Summer sulfate aerosol forcing in the Northern Hemisphere completely offsets the greenhouse forcing over the eastern United States and central Europe. Anthropogenic sulfate aerosols contribute a globally averaged annual forcing of -0.3 watt per square meter as compared with +2.1 watts per square meter for greenhouse gases. Sources of the difference in magnitude with the previous estimate of Charlson et al. are discussed.

The physical, biological, and chemical soil properties and economic profitability of adjacent, commercial biodynamic and conventional farms (16 total) in New Zealand were compared. The biodynamic farms in the study had better soil quality than the neighboring conventional farms and were just as financially viable on a per hectare basis."

When such a film is fabricated on a gold film, a nonequilibrium population of spin-polarized electrons is built up in the gold causing a ""spin bottleneck"" effect. The addition of a second ferromagnetic film results in a device whose output voltage depends on the orientation of the spins."
https://openalex.org/W1983135265,"Monolayer Langmuir-Blodgett films of a discotic mesogen have been studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM). These measurements confirm the ""edge on"" arrangement for the disk-shaped molecules suggested by surface pressure-area isotherms and show that the molecules form columns that are separated by 17.7 angstroms +/- 10 percent. Column alignment is found to be predominantly along the film deposition direction, with an angular spread of 35 degrees . The AFM images also show that the mean disk separation within the columns is 5.1 +/- 1.3 angstroms, in good agreement with x-ray diffraction (XRD) results. Roomtemperature XRD measurements on bulk samples of the same material indicate a disordered-hexagonal liquid crystalline mesophase, with a column-to-column spacing of 19.9 +/- 0.2 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W2019045216,"A network of open, bistable reaction systems coupled by mass transfer is simulated. The mass transfer rates are determined by a Hebb-type rule, and the programmable network can store patterns of high and low concentrations in each bistable system. In a parallel computation, the network recognizes patterns similar, but not necessarily identical, to stored patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2059951396,"The liquid-vapor interface of a bismuth-gallium mixture (0.2 percent bismuth and 99.8 percent gallium) at 36Â°C has been studied by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. The data show, in agreement with thermodynamic arguments, that bismuth is heavily concentrated in the liquid-vapor interface. The x-ray diffraction data are interpreted with the assistance of a simple model that represents the interface as a partial monolayer of bismuth. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the bismuth concentration in the interface is about 80 percent, that there is no significant mixing of gallium and bismuth in the interface, and that the structure function of the interfacial bismuth is like that of supercooled bulk liquid bismuth."
https://openalex.org/W2066769262,"Ground-based observations of two conspicuous features near the north pole of Saturn, the polar vortex and the hexagonal wave structure, were made from July 1990 to October 1991, 10 years after their discovery. During this period the polar spot drifted in longitude, relative to system III, by -0.0353 degrees per day on average. Superimposed on this mean motion, the spot also underwent short-term rapid excursions in longitude of up to approximately 14 degrees at rates of up to approximately 1 degrees per day. The spot also exhibited irregular variations in its latitude location. A combination of these data together with those obtained by Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981 shows that the spot drifted -0.0577 degrees per day for the 11-year interval from 1980 to 1991. The large lifetime of both features indicates that they are insensitive to the strong variations in the seasonal heating of the cloud layers in the upper polar atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2062126011,"Polar projections of 50 images of Saturn at 889 nanometers and 25 images at 718 nanometers taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in November 1990, as well as 3 images at each wavelength taken in June 1991, have been examined. Among them, 31 show the north polar spot, which is associated with Saturn's polar hexagon, in locations suitable for measurement. In each image, planetocentric coordinates of the polar spot were determined, and the movement of the spot with respect to Saturn's system III rotation rate was studied. During the period of observation, the polar spot had first a short-term westward movement and then a long-term eastward drift. The rate of the long-term drift was -0.060 +/- 0.008 degrees per day with respect to system III, approximately 50 percent greater than previously determined from Voyager. The original 1980 and 1981 Voyager data were combined with the new Hubble images to form an 11-year base line. The eastward drift over the longer period was -0.0569 degrees per day. The long-term drift could be due to uncertainty in the standard value of the internal rotation period, which is 810.7939 +/- 0.148 degrees per 24-hour day. The short-term movement in November 1990 has a rate that is greater in magnitude but opposite in sign and probably represents a real, transient motion of the spot relative to the internal rotation system."

https://openalex.org/W2041612168,"Analysis indicates that the true costs of utility-subsidized electricity conservation are often significantly higher than the costs reported by utilities and, in turn, are significantly higher than those suggested by widely cited TP studies. In addition, the experience of utilities with careful measurement programs indicates that the magnitude of energy savings achievable through their programs is substantially smaller than assumed by the TP studies. These findings do not imply that policies that promote energy conservation are undesirable. Real barriers do exist in energy markets and are a legitimate concern of public policy. Results do suggest that utility programs will provide much smaller environmental and economic gains than have been suggested by many studies. Furthermore, many improvements in cost accounting, monitoring, and savings estimation are required to measure costs and savings accurately. The current policy emphasis on utility subsidy programs, and the often complex and costly bureaucratic planning procedures associated with them, is therefore misplaced. Public policy should instead by focused on other measures to ameliorate real market barriers and, in general, to promote well-functioning energy markets."

https://openalex.org/W2010531497,"The Rockies were hidden by clouds, but ""Welcome ACS"" signs were visible all over the Mile High City from 28 March to 2 April. No wonder the city's boosters were cheering: More than 10,000 scientists, purveyors of laboratory equipment, and other chemophiles had flooded into Denver to take in a vision of chemistry's intellectual scope that was wide enough to compensate for the missing scenic grandeur. In just a tiny sampling of the roughly 4800 presentations, chemistry appears in guises ranging from the most basic molecule making, through cleanup strategies for major environmental challenges, to forensic methods for unraveling a historical mystery."
https://openalex.org/W2028791456,"Each year's new computing technology, it seems, leaves the last year's in the dust. But physicists are now beginning to tell computer scientists that it can't go on this way. Sooner or later, as computers get smaller, faster, and more complex, the laws of physics will throw up roadblocks to further progress. There's only one way out of this bind: radically new strategies. And some of those strategies are starting to emerge."
