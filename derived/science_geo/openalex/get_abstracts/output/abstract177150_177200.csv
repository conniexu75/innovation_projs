The precise mechanism linking obesity and vascular disease is still unclear. Previously we have demonstrated that the plasma levels of adiponectin, an adipose-derived hormone, decreases in obese subjects, and that hypoadiponectinemia is associated to ischemic heart disease. In current the study, we investigated the in vivorole of adiponectin on the neointimal thickening after artery injury using adiponectin-deficient mice and adiponectin-producing adenovirus. Adiponectin-deficient mice showed severe neointimal thickening and increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells in mechanically injured arteries. Adenovirus-mediated supplement of adiponectin attenuated neointimal proliferation. In cultured smooth muscle cells, adiponectin attenuated DNA synthesis induced by growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, and EGF and cell proliferation and migration induced by HB-EGF. In cultured endothelial cells, adiponectin attenuated HB-EGF expression stimulated by tumor necrosis factor α. The current study suggests an adipo-vascular axis, a direct link between fat and artery. A therapeutic strategy to increase plasma adiponectin should be useful in preventing vascular restenosis after angioplasty.

Acrp30 or AdipoQ, independently cloned by two groups, is the mouse counterpart of adiponectin (9Scherer P.E. Williams S. Fogliano M. Baldini G. Lodish H.F. J. Biol.

Adiponectin is composed of two structurally distinct domains: C-terminal collagen-like fibrous domain and complement C1q-like globular domain. Interestingly, low plasma concentrations of adiponectin are found in obese subjects (11Arita Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Miyagawa J. Hotta K. Shimomura I. Nakamura T. Miyaoka K. Kuriyama H. Nishida M. Yamashita S. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Takahashi M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the incidence of cardiovascular death is higher in renal failure patients with low plasma adiponectin compared with those with higher plasma adiponectin levels (13Zoccali C. Mallamaci F. Tripepi G. Benedetto F.A. Cutrupi S. Parlongo S. Malatino L.S. Bonanno G. Seminara G. Rapisarda F. Fatuzzo P. Buemi M. Nicocia G. Tanaka S. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 134-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also reported that adiponectin infiltrates rapidly into the subendothelial space of the vascular wall when the endothelial barrier of the arterial wall is injured by balloon angioplasty (14Okamoto Y. Arita Y. Nishida M. Muraguchi M. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Igura T. Inui Y. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Miyagawa J. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Horm. Metab. Res. 2000; 32: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). In tissue cultures, adiponectin attenuates monocyte attachment to endothelial cells by reducing the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells (12Ouchi N. Kihara S. Arita Y. Maeda K. Kuriyama H. Okamoto Y. Hotta K. Nishida M. Takahashi M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar, 15Ouchi N.

Circulation. 2000; 102: 1296-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Adiponectin also suppresses lipid accumulation in monocyte-derived macrophages through the suppression of macrophage scavenger receptor expression (16Ouchi N. Kihara S. Arita Y. Nishida M. Matsuyama A. Okamoto Y. Ishigami M. Kuriyama H. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Hotta K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Yamashita S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 2001; 103: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). These in vitro data suggested the anti-atherogenic properties of adiponectin, and hence hypoadiponectinemia might be associated with a higher incidence of vascular diseases in obese subjects.In the present study, we investigated the role of adiponectin on the vascular wall in vivo using adiponectin knockout (KO) mice and adiponectin-producing adenovirus (17Maeda N. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Nagaretani H. Furuyama N. Kondo H. Takahashi M. Arita Y. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Tochino Y. Okutomi K. Horie M. Takeda S. Aoyama T. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that adiponectin deficiency aggravates neointimal thickening, and adiponectin supplement attenuates neointimal thickening in mechanically injured arteries, presumably through the suppressive effect of adiponectin on the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. Here we show the first in vivo evidence that adiponectin is a fat-derived hormone directly bridging the adipose-vascular axis.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we demonstrated that adiponectin-null mice exhibited augmented intimal proliferation in mechanically injured vascular walls. Adenovirus-mediated supplement of adiponectin improved the intimal thickening in KO mice to the WT level. How does adiponectin suppress intimal thickening? Fig. 6illustrates a working model based on the results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments described in the present study. Adiponectin suppressed the expression of HB-EGF in stimulated endothelial cells of injured vascular wall and also the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells stimulated by various growth factors such as PDGF, basic FGF, EGF, and HB-EGF. These suppressive effects of adiponectin on the production and action of growth factors in vascular wall should explain the mechanism for the suppressive action of adiponectin on the vascular stenosis and indicate that it could prevent injury-induced intimal thickening.Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and HB-EGF are vasoactive substances produced by adipose tissue, although these substances are not adipose-specific. Both factors are considered to promote the development of vascular diseases in obesity (6Shimomura I. Funahashi T. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Kotani K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Miura M. Fukuda Y. Takemura K. Tokunaga K. Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 7Matsumoto S. Kishida K. Shimomura I. Maeda N. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Nishizawa H. Kihara S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Contrary to these factors, the plasma concentration of adipose-specific adiponectin is lower in obese subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (11Arita Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Miyagawa J. Hotta K. Shimomura I. Nakamura T. Miyaoka K. Kuriyama H. Nishida M. Yamashita S. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that adiponectin suppressed VSMC proliferation. Taken together, adipose tissue secretes both the offense molecules (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and HB-EGF) and the defense molecule (adiponectin) into the blood stream, reaching the vascular wall. Then, in obesity, both the increase of offense molecules and decrease of defense molecule(s) in plasma should aggravate vascular diseases. Considering the adipose specificity, adiponectin should play a major role in the adipo-vascular axis.Recent studies have identified the role of various molecules derived from adipose tissue in the development of insulin resistance. These include TNFα, leptin, and resistin (3Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4483) Google Scholar, 4Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 2001; 409: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). More recently adiponectin treatment has been shown to improve fatty acid oxidation and insulin resistance in diabetic animals (23Yamauchi T. Kamon J. Waki H. Terauchi Y. Kubota N. Hara K. Mori Y. Ide T. Murakami K. Tsuboyama-Kasaoka N. Ezaki O. Akanuma Y. Gavrilova O. Vinson C. Reitman M.L. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Yoda M. Nakano Y. Tobe K. Nagai R. Kimura S. Tomita M. Froguel P. Kadowaki T.

Med. 2001; 7: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar). Adiponectin-null mice show normal insulin sensitivity under a regular diet but severe insulin resistance under a high fat/high sucrose diet (17Maeda N. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M. Nagaretani H. Furuyama N. Kondo H. Takahashi M. Arita Y. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Tochino Y. Okutomi K. Horie M. Takeda S. Aoyama T. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Interestingly, subjects carrying a missense mutation in the adiponectin gene associated with hypoadiponectinemia exhibit the phenotype of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and coronary artery disease (25Kondo H. Shimomura I. Matsukawa Y. Kumada M. Takahashi M. Matsuda M. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Kawamoto T. Sumitsuji S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2325-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hypoadiponectinemia associated with obesity is located upstream of metabolic syndrome in the pathophysiology. In the present study, adiponectin-null mice showed profound neointimal hyperplasia despite normal glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results indicate that injury-induced neointimal formation does not accelerate as a result of abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism but is directly caused by adiponectin deficiency. Therapeutic approaches that increase plasma adiponectin concentration could be useful in preventing restenosis after vascular intervention. Obesity is a common risk for insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S.

Adiponectin-null mice show normal insulin sensitivity under a regular diet but severe insulin resistance under a high fat/high sucrose diet (17Maeda N. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Nishizawa H. Matsuda M.

Med. 2002; 8: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar). Interestingly, subjects carrying a missense mutation in the adiponectin gene associated with hypoadiponectinemia exhibit the phenotype of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance and coronary artery disease (25Kondo H. Shimomura I. Matsukawa Y. Kumada M. Takahashi M. Matsuda M. Ouchi N. Kihara S. Kawamoto T. Sumitsuji S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2325-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that hypoadiponectinemia associated with obesity is located upstream of metabolic syndrome in the pathophysiology. In the present study, adiponectin-null mice showed profound neointimal hyperplasia despite normal glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results indicate that injury-induced neointimal formation does not accelerate as a result of abnormalities of glucose and lipid metabolism but is directly caused by adiponectin deficiency. Therapeutic approaches that increase plasma adiponectin concentration could be useful in preventing restenosis after vascular intervention. In the current study, we demonstrated that adiponectin-null mice exhibited augmented intimal proliferation in mechanically injured vascular walls. Adenovirus-mediated supplement of adiponectin improved the intimal thickening in KO mice to the WT level. How does adiponectin suppress intimal thickening? Fig. 6illustrates a working model based on the results of our in vivo and in vitro experiments described in the present study. Adiponectin suppressed the expression of HB-EGF in stimulated endothelial cells of injured vascular wall and also the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells stimulated by various growth factors such as PDGF, basic FGF, EGF, and HB-EGF. These suppressive effects of adiponectin on the production and action of growth factors in vascular wall should explain the mechanism for the suppressive action of adiponectin on the vascular stenosis and indicate that it could prevent injury-induced intimal thickening. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and HB-EGF are vasoactive substances produced by adipose tissue, although these substances are not adipose-specific. Both factors are considered to promote the development of vascular diseases in obesity (6Shimomura I. Funahashi T. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Kotani K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Miura M. Fukuda Y.

Kihara S. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Contrary to these factors, the plasma concentration of adipose-specific adiponectin is lower in obese subjects and patients with coronary artery disease (11Arita Y. Kihara S. Ouchi N. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Miyagawa J. Hotta K. Shimomura I. Nakamura T. Miyaoka K. Kuriyama H. Nishida M. Yamashita S. Okubo K. Matsubara K. Muraguchi M. Ohmoto Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2473-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated in vivo and in vitro that adiponectin suppressed VSMC proliferation. Taken together, adipose tissue secretes both the offense molecules (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and HB-EGF) and the defense molecule (adiponectin) into the blood stream, reaching the vascular wall. Then, in obesity, both the increase of offense molecules and decrease of defense molecule(s) in plasma should aggravate vascular diseases. Considering the adipose specificity, adiponectin should play a major role in the adipo-vascular axis. Recent studies have identified the role of various molecules derived from adipose tissue in the development of insulin resistance. These include TNFα, leptin, and resistin (3Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L.

https://openalex.org/W1967899512,"The insulin receptor (IR) and the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) have a highly homologous structure, but different biological effects. Insulin and IGF-I half-receptors can heterodimerize, leading to the formation of insulin/IGF-I hybrid receptors (Hybrid-Rs) that bind IGF-I with high affinity. As the IR exists in two isoforms (IR-A and IR-B), we evaluated whether the assembly of the IGF-IR with either IR-A or IR-B moieties may differently affect Hybrid-R signaling and biological role. Three different models were studied: (<i>a</i>) 3T3-like mouse fibroblasts with a disrupted IGF-IR gene (R<sup>−</sup> cells) cotransfected with the human IGF-IR and with either the IR-A or IR-B cDNA; (<i>b</i>) a panel of human cell lines variably expressing the two IR isoforms; and (<i>c</i>) HepG2 human hepatoblastoma cells predominantly expressing either IR-A or IR-B, depending on their differentiation state. We found that Hybrid-Rs containing IR-A (Hybrid-Rs<sup>A</sup>) bound to and were activated by IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin. By binding to Hybrid-Rs<sup>A</sup>, insulin activated the IGF-I half-receptor β-subunit and the IGF-IR-specific substrate CrkII. In contrast, Hybrid-Rs<sup>B</sup>bound to and were activated with high affinity by IGF-I, with low affinity by IGF-II, and insignificantly by insulin. As a consequence, cell proliferation and migration in response to both insulin and IGFs were more effectively stimulated in Hybrid-R<sup>A</sup>-containing cells than in Hybrid-R<sup>B</sup>-containing cells. The relative abundance of IR isoforms therefore affects IGF system activation through Hybrid-Rs, with important consequences for tissue-specific responses to both insulin and IGFs."

Hepcidin-25 assumes major and minor conformations centered about the Pro residue near the N-terminal end. Further NMR diffusion studies indicate that hepcidin-20 exists as a monomer in solution, whereas hepcidin-25 readily aggregates, a property that may contribute to the different activities of the two peptides.

The likely role of hepcidin in iron metabolism was further suggested by the observation that mice with disruption of the gene encoding the transcription factor USF2 failed to produce hepcidin mRNA and developed spontaneous visceral iron overload (5Nicolas G.

Because the USF2 gene is located immediately upstream of the two murine hepcidin genes, and its disruption by neo gene insertion exerts a detectable effect even in a heterozygous state, it is thought that the upstreamneo insertion exerts a cis-inhibitory effect on the downstream genes. In contrast, mice engineered to overexpress hepcidin experience severe iron deficiency anemia (6Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Porteu A. Mativet S. Beaumont C. Grandchamp B. Sirito M. Sawadogo M. Kahn A.

As a result, the Dnmt3a2 protein lacks the N-terminal 223 (human) or 219 (mouse) amino acid residues of the full-length Dnmt3a. Recombinant Dnmt3a2 protein displayed similar cytosine methyltransferase activity as Dnmt3ain vitro. However, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 exhibited strikingly different subcellular localization patterns. Unlike Dnmt3a, which was concentrated on heterochromatin, Dnmt3a2 displayed a localization pattern suggestive of euchromatin association. Dnmt3a2 is the predominant form in embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma cells and can also be detected from testis, ovary, thymus, and spleen, whereas Dnmt3a is expressed at low levels ubiquitously. Comparison of human embryonal carcinoma cell lines with breast/ovarian cancer cell lines indicates that DNMT3A2 expression correlates with high de novo methylation activity.

Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E.

Although both Dnmt1 and the Dnmt3 family of enzymes methylate predominantly CpG dinucleotides in vitro, genetic studies reveal that these two classes of enzymes display different activities and functions in vivo. Dnmt1 is primarily responsible for the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in proliferating cells, whereas Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are necessary for de novomethylation and for the establishment of new methylation patterns in mammalian cells and transgenic flies (7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar, 8Lei H., Oh, S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E.

In mice, DNA methylation patterns are established during embryonic development through dynamic regulation of de novomethylation and demethylation. De novo methylation also occurs during gametogenesis in both male and female germ cells and is believed to play a critical role in the establishment of genomic imprinting in the gametes. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process that marks alleles according to their parental origin during gametogenesis and results in monoallelic expression of a small set of genes (known as imprinted genes) in the offspring (for reviews, see Refs. 11Jaenisch R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar and 12Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Dnmt3a is required for the establishment of methylation imprints in the oocytes (13Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). De novo methylation has been detected mainly in embryonic stem (ES) cells and embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, early embryos, and developing germ cells, whereas it is largely suppressed in differentiated somatic cells (8Lei H., Oh, S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stewart C.L. Stuhlmann H. Jahner D. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because aberrant de novo methylation of CpG sites in promoter sequences can lead to abnormal gene silencing and is associated with diseases such as cancers (17Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2000; 1: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), it is believed thatde novo methylation must be under tight regulation during development. Dnmt1 is expressed ubiquitously, and its function is required for the survival of somatic cells (8Lei H., Oh, S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tucker K.L. Beard C. Dausmann J. Jackson-Grusby L. Laird P.W. Lei H., Li, E. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1008-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, on the other hand, are regulated during development (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Although both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b transcripts are present at very low levels in somatic cells, they are expressed at high levels in ES cells and germ cells in which active de novo methylation is detected. Several different Dnmt3b transcripts, resulting from alternative splicing of exons 10, 21, and/or 22, have been reported (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar,5Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M., Li, Y., He, W.W. Okumura K. Li E.

Dnmt3b1 and Dnmt3b2 are enzymatically active in standard DNA methyltransferase assays, whereas Dnmt3b3, which lacks part of motif IX, appears to be inactive (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 21Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Dnmt3b4 andDnmt3b5 encode truncated proteins that lack motifs IX and X and are presumably inactive (19Robertson K.D. Uzvolgyi E. Liang G. Talmadge C. Sumegi J. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 20Hansen R.S. Wijmenga C. Luo P. Stanek A.M. Canfield T.K. Weemaes C.M. Gartler S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

So far, only one form of Dnmt3a has been identified and shown to be capable of methylating DNA bothin vitro and in vivo (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E.

Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). DNA methylation may also be regulated through subcellular localization of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Tagged Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins have been shown to localize preferentially to the heterochromatin in transfected cells (22Bachman K.E. Rountree M.R. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32282-32287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have been shown to interact with histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and transcription factors RP58 and PML (22Bachman K.E. Rountree M.R. Baylin S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32282-32287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 23Fuks F. Burgers W.A. Godin N. Kasai M. Kouzarides T.

Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), which may target Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Although the majority of CpG islands, which usually localize in euchromatin regions, are methylation-free, some CpG islands become methylated during development or under pathological conditions such as in cancer cells (25Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar). It remains unknown how DNA methylation is differentially regulated in different chromatin regions and what enzymes are involved. In this study, we report the identification of a novel isoform of Dnmt3a, termed Dnmt3a2, which is encoded by transcripts initiated from an intronic promoter. Dnmt3a2 has similar methyltransferase activity to Dnmt3a, but it localizes to euchromatin instead of heterochromatin. Moreover, Dnmt3a2 expression is tightly regulated and correlates with high de novo methylation activity, whereas Dnmt3a is expressed ubiquitously. Therefore, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 may methylate distinct DNA targets and have different functions in development. The GFP-Dnmt3a and GFP-Dnmt3b, the Dnmt3a- and Dnmt3b-pcDNA, and the His6-tagged Dnmt3a constructs were generated by subcloning the corresponding Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b cDNA into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), pcDNA6/V5-HisA (Invitrogen), and pET-28b(+) (Novagen), respectively. The luciferase reporter constructs were generated by inserting a ∼2.0-kb Dnmt3a genomic fragment, which contains a putative promoter (P2), in forward (P2-luc) or reverse (P2R-luc) orientation into pGL3-Basic (Promega). The P2 targeting vector was constructed by sequentially subcloning Dnmt3agenomic fragments (arms), the hCMV-hygTK cassette, and the PGK-DTA cassette into pBluescript II SK. All of the Dnmt3a genomic fragments were generated by PCR using a BAC clone (Genome Systems Inc.) as the template and the following pairs of oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-CTGGGATCCAGGCACCTGGGGTGTTACCT-3′ and 5′-GGTGGATCCCCTCTGCAGTACAGCTC-3′ (for P2-luc and P2R-luc), 5′-CTGGAATTCTCCTACCTT TG-3′ and 5′-CCTGGATCCCAGCCAGTGAGCTGG-3′ (for P2 targeting vector, 5′ arm, 3.7 kb), and 5′-GTTCCGCGGCTGCTCATT-3′ and 5′-CCACCGCGGCCGACTTGCCTCTACTTC-3′ (for P2 targeting vector, 3′ arm, 3.0 kb). (The restriction sites used for cloning are underlined). The identities of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b rabbit polyclonal antibodies, 164 and 157, were generated against mouse Dnmt3a amino acids 15–126 and Dnmt3b amino acids 1–181, respectively. The Dnmt3a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (clone 64B1446) was purchased from Imgenex. Anti-GFP mAb (a mixture of clones 7.1 and 13.1) was obtained from Roche. Anti-tubulin mAb (Ab-1) was obtained from Oncogene Research Products. Anti-DNMT1 (human) polyclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs. Anti-histone H1 (AE-4) and anti-lamin B (M-20) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transient transfection was carried out in COS-7, NIH 3T3, or ES cells using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and fluorescence microscopy analyses were performed as previously described (26He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 27Chen T. Richard S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4863-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Chen T. Boisvert F.M. Bazett-Jones D.P. Richard S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3015-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter constructs as well as pGL-3-Basic (empty vector) were individually co-transfected with pRL-TK (internal control, Promega) into ES cells or NIH 3T3 cells. The cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activities using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). 5′-RACE was carried out on total RNA prepared from ES cells using the 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen) with Dnmt3a-specific primers: 5′-AGCTGCTCGGCTCCGGCC-3′ (for reverse transcription), 5′-TCCCCCACACCAGCTCTCC-3′ (for first round of PCR), and 5′-CTGCAATTACCTTGGCTT-3′ (for second round of PCR). For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT)12–18, and the resulting cDNAs were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were analyzed either by ethidium bromide staining (for Dnmt3a) or Southern hybridization using cDNA fragments as probes (for Dnmt3b). Dnmt3a-specific primers used are 5′-TCCAGCGGCCCCGGGGAC-3′ (F1), 5′-CCCAACCTGAGGAAGGGA-3′ (F2), 5′-ACCAACATCGAATCCATG-3′ (F3), 5′-TCCCGGGGCCGACTGCGA-3′ (F4), 5′-AGGGGCTGCACCTGGCCTT-3′ (F5), 5′-TCCCCCACACCAGCTCTCC-3′ (R1), and 5′-CCTCTGCAGTACAGCTCA-3′ (R2). Dnmt3b-specific primers used are 5′-TGGGATCGAGGGCCTCAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTCCACAGGACAAACAGCGG-3′ (for exon 10) and 5′-GCGACAACCGTCCATTCTTC-3′ and 5′-CTCTGGGCACTGGCTCTGACC-3′ (for exons 21 and 22). Northern hybridization was performed according to standard protocols. Dnmt3a cDNA fragments used as probes were generated by PCR. The primer pairs used were 5′-GCAGAGCCGCCTGAAGCC-3′ and 5′-CCTTTTCCAACGTGCCAG-3′ (for probe 1) and 5′-GCCAAGGTAATTGCAGTA-3′ and 5′-GATGTTTCTGCACTTCTG-3′ (for probe 2). The P2 targeting vector was electroporated intoDnmt3a +/− ES cells (7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar), which were subsequently selected in hygromycin-containing medium. Genomic DNA isolated from hygromycin-resistant colonies was digested with ScaI and analyzed by Southern hybridization using a 0.45-kbKpnI-SpeI fragment as a probe. For in vitro DNA methyltransferase activity, His6-tagged Dnmt3a proteins were incubated with double-stranded poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia) in the presence of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (methyl-3H) (SAM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the incorporation of 3H methyl groups into poly(dI-dC) was measured as previously described (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 21Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h in methylation buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25% glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing the purified enzyme, the substrate DNA, and SAM at concentrations of 0.5 μm, 2 μm, and 2 μm, respectively. For de novo methylation activity, human EC cell lines and breast/ovarian cancer cell lines were infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus, and the methylation status of newly integrated provirus was analyzed as previously described (8Lei H., Oh, S.P. Okano M. Juttermann R. Goss K.A. Jaenisch R. Li E. Development. 1996; 122: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins show high sequence homology in the C-terminal catalytic domain, but they share little sequence similarity in the N-terminal regulatory region except for the conserved proline-tryptophan-tryptophan-proline and plant homeodomain domains (Fig. 1 A). To characterize the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b proteins, we generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N-terminal regions of mouse Dnmt3a (antibody 164) and Dnmt3b (antibody 157) and also obtained a commercial mAb (64B1446), which was raised against the full-length mouse Dnmt3a. The epitope recognized by 64B1446 was mapped to a region (amino acids 705–908) at the C terminus (data not shown). The specificity of these antibodies was examined using GFP fusion proteins expressed in Cos-7 cells (Fig. 1 B). Anti-GFP immunoblotting showed the expression of the GFP fusion proteins (first panel). The polyclonal antibodies, 164 and 157, were specific for Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, respectively (second andthird panels). The mAb, 64B1446, reacted strongly with Dnmt3a proteins and weakly with Dnmt3b1 and Dnmt3b2, but not Dnmt3b3 (fourth panel), consistent with the epitope-mapping results. Previous studies showed that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3btranscripts were abundant in ES cells (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar), but their protein products were not analyzed. To address this question, we analyzed wild-type (J1), Dnmt3a −/− (6aa),Dnmt3b −/− (8bb), and [Dnmt3a −/−,Dnmt3b −/−] (7aabb) mutant ES cells (7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar) by immunoblotting with the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b antibodies (Fig. 1,C and D). Two distinct bands, which migrated at ∼120 and ∼110 kDa, were detected by antibody 157 in J1 and 6aa cells, but not in 8bb and 7aabb cells (Fig. 1 C), indicating that these bands represent Dnmt3b proteins. The more abundant 120-kDa band most likely represents Dnmt3b1, and the 110-kDa band represents an isoform smaller than Dnmt3b2 but slightly larger than Dnmt3b3 (Fig.1 C). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of two majorDnmt3b transcripts in ES cells; one corresponds toDnmt3b1 and the other is an alternatively spliced variant that lacks exons 21 and 22 (Fig. 6 and data not shown). We named this new isoform Dnmt3b6 (schematically shown in Fig.1 A). Indeed, the 110-kDa band observed in ES cells co-migrated with protein expressed from Dnmt3b6 cDNA (Fig.1 C, lanes 8 and 9). Dnmt3b6 lacks motif IX and thus may not be enzymatically active, like Dnmt3b3 (21Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a-specific antibody 164 detected a single band of ∼130 kDa in J1 and 8bb cells, which co-migrated with the control Dnmt3a protein (Fig.1 D, lanes 1, 2, and 5), but not in 6aa and 7aabb cells (lanes 3 and 4). Surprisingly, when the same blot was reprobed with anti-Dnmt3a mAb 64B1446, two more intense bands of ∼120 kDa and ∼100 kDa were detected in addition to the 130-kDa Dnmt3a protein in J1 cells (Fig.1 D, lane 7). The 120-kDa band represents Dnmt3b1, as it was also present in 6aa cells but absent in 8bb cells (lanes 9 and 10). Like the 130-kDa Dnmt3a protein, the 100-kDa band could be detected in 8bb cells (lane 10) but not in 6aa and 7aabb cells (lanes 8and 9), indicating that it is a novel product of theDnmt3a gene. We named this short form Dnmt3a2. Importantly, the immunoblotting result indicates that Dnmt3a2 is the predominantDnmt3a gene product in ES cells (Fig. 1 D). The fact that Dnmt3a2 could not be recognized by antibody 164 suggests that Dnmt3a2 lacks the N-terminal region of Dnmt3a. Inspection of theDnmt3a cDNA sequence revealed that, in addition to the known initiation codon (ATG1), two downstream in-frame ATGs (ATG2 and ATG3), corresponding to Met-159 and Met-220, were found to be within the Kozak consensus sequence. To test the possibility that Dnmt3a2 was produced by translation initiated at one of these ATGs, we expressed in 6aa cells two Dnmt3a proteins with the N-terminal 158 and 219 amino acids truncated and showed that Dnmt3a (220–908) co-migrated with endogenous Dnmt3a2 from J1 cells (Fig. 1 E, comparelanes 3 and 4). This result suggests that ATG3 might be the initiation codon for Dnmt3a2. To further determine whether Dnmt3a2 is produced from the same mRNA transcript as Dnmt3a, we transfected 6aa cells with an expression vector containing the entireDnmt3a coding sequence. Immunoblotting analysis using antibody 64B1446 showed that only Dnmt3a was expressed (Fig.1 F, lane 2). These results suggest that Dnmt3a2 does not derive from Dnmt3a transcript by the use of an alternative ATG or from Dnmt3a protein by proteolytic cleavage or degradation. To determine whether Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 are encoded by distinct mRNA transcripts, total RNA from J1, 6aa ES cells, and NIH 3T3 cells (which express only Dnmt3a; see Fig. 7) was analyzed by Northern hybridization with Dnmt3a cDNA probes upstream or downstream of ATG3 (Fig.2 B). The downstream probe (Fig. 2 A, Probe 2) detected two major transcripts of 4.2 kb and 4.0 kb and a weak band of 9.5 kb from J1 cells (Fig.2 B, lane 5), consistent with our previous results (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). All of the transcripts were smaller, and the intensity of 4.2 kb and 4.0 kb bands was substantially reduced in 6aa cells (lane 6), indicating that truncated transcripts were generated. The 9.5-kb transcript was also present at low level in NIH 3T3 cells, but the 4.2-kb and 4.0-kb transcripts were absent (lane 4). Interestingly, the upstream probe (Fig. 2 A, Probe 1) recognized the 9.5-kb transcript in NIH 3T3 and J1 cells and a 7.5-kb truncated form in 6aa cells, but it failed to hybridize to the 4.2-kb and 4.0-kb transcripts in J1 cells (lanes 1–3). Taken together, these observations suggest that Dnmt3a2 is probably encoded by the 4.2-kb and 4.0-kb transcripts. Our previous data indicated that the 4.2-kb and 4.0-kb transcripts differ in their 3′-untranslated region, probably due to alternative 3′ processing (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether Dnmt3a is encoded by the 9.5-kb transcript or whether the Dnmt3a signal is too weak to be detected.Figure 2Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 are encoded by distinct transcripts. A, the structure of mouse and humanDnmt3a gene, mRNAs and proteins. Exons are shown asblack bars. The Dnmt3a2-unique exons are indicated by an asterisk. Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 proteins have identical amino acid sequences except that Dnmt3a has 219 (mouse) or 223 (human) extra residues at the N terminus (human DNMT3A amino acid numbering is shown in parentheses). The primers used for RT-PCR are shown under the corresponding exons (F, forward;R, reverse). The probes used for Northern hybridization, shown under the Dnmt3a protein, represent the corresponding cDNA fragments. B, Northern blots of total RNA (20 μg per lane) from NIH 3T3, J1, and 6aa cells were probed with Probe 1 (lanes 1–3) or Probe 2 (lanes 4–6). As a loading control, the 28S rRNA stained with ethidium bromide was shown at thebottom. C, total RNA from J1 cells was reverse transcribed using poly (dT)12–18, and the resulting cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification with the indicated Dnmt3a primers. Dnmt3a cDNA was used as a positive control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the identity of the Dnmt3a transcripts, we performed 5′-RACE on RNA prepared from J1 ES cells with primers annealing to Dnmt3a sequences downstream of the putative Dnmt3a2 translation start site (ATG3 at M220). Two species ofDnmt3a transcripts were obtained. One of them matched theDnmt3a cDNA sequence, and the other contained a 55-bp sequence at its 5′ end that did not match any known Dnmt3acDNA sequence. Searches of the Celera mouse-genome data base revealed that the 55-bp sequence was part of an exon located in an intron of the Dnmt3a gene. Using the new exon sequence as query, we identified a mouse expressed sequence tag clone,BE855330, which extended the exon to at least 117 bp. Sequencing analysis revealed that the expressed sequence tag clone shared all the downstream exons with Dnmt3a (Fig. 2 A). We conclude that the newly identified transcript encodes Dnmt3a2, because its open reading frame would predict a protein that lacks the N-terminal 219 amino acids of Dnmt3a (Fig. 2 A). As illustrated in Fig. 2 A, the murine Dnmt3a gene consists of 24 exons. Exons 8–24 are shared by both Dnmt3aand Dnmt3a2. Exons 1–6 are present only inDnmt3a, whereas exon 7 (indicated by an asterisk) is unique to Dnmt3a2. By RT-PCR analysis and data base searches, we also identified human DNMT3A2 (Fig.2 A). It is very similar to its murine homologue except that it contains an additional sequence of 68 bp in the 5′-untranslated region, which is encoded by an extra exon located ∼2.5 kb downstream of exon 7 (the newly identified exons are indicated by an asterisk). The predicted mouse Dnmt3a2 and human DNMT3A2 proteins, each consisting of 689 amino acids (Fig. 2 A), show high sequence identity (98.5%). The 5′-RACE results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of total RNA from J1 cells using primers annealing to different Dnmt3a exons (Fig. 2 A). Combination of Dnmt3a-specific (F1–F4) or Dnmt3a2-specific (F5) primers with a downstream primer in exon 9 (R1) verified the expression of both Dnmt3aand Dnmt3a2 transcripts in ES cells (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1–4 and 9–16). However, combination of the same Dnmt3a primers (F1–F4) with a primer in the uniqueDnmt3a2 exon (R2) failed to generate any PCR products (lanes 5–8). These results indicate that it is unlikely that the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a2 transcripts are produced via alternative splicing. The observation that the Dnmt3a2-specific exon is located in a region >80 kb downstream of the putative Dnmt3a promoter suggests that Dnmt3a2 transcription may be driven by a different promoter. Indeed, analysis of the large (∼18 kb) “intron” preceding exon 7 with PROSCAN (bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/proscan) predicted that a 1.4-kb region immediately upstream of exon 7 has a high probability to function as a promoter. It should also be noted that the uniqueDnmt3a2 exon resides in a GC-rich CpG island, which is a hallmark of the promoter region of genes. We tested the transcriptional activity of the putative promoter using a reporter system (Fig.3). A ∼2.0-kb genomic fragment that includes the putative promoter (P2) was inserted, in both orientations, upstream of the cDNA encoding the firefly luciferase followed by the SV40 late poly(A) signal (Fig. 3 A). Transient-transfection experiments demonstrated that the P2 fragment has high promoter activity in ES cells but much lower activity in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 B, P2-luc), consistent with the expression levels of Dnmt3a2 in these cell types (Fig.2 B). The transcriptional activity of the P2 fragment is orientation-dependent, as the same fragment showed no promoter activity when subcloned in reverse orientation (Fig.2 B, P2R-luc). As a positive control, SV40 promoter worked equally well in both cell types (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the region 5′ adjacent to exon 7 functions as a promoter and drives the expression of Dnmt3a2. To confirm that exon 7 and the adjacent promoter are essential for the expression of Dnmt3a2, we deleted the P2 region from the wild-type allele in Dnmt3a +/− ES cells (7Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A.

https://openalex.org/W2129003781,"KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on dedifferentiated renal proximal tubule epithelial cells undergoing regeneration after toxic or ischemic injury. The extracellular domain of KIM-1 is composed of an immunoglobulin-like domain topping a long mucin-like domain, a structure that points to a possible role in cell adhesion by homology to several known adhesion proteins. Two splice variants (a and b), of the human KIM-1 having identical extracellular domains, differ in their cytoplasmic domains and tissue distributions. In this study, we report that the KIM-1b transcript is expressed predominantly in adult human kidney. We describe the generation of 10 monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of human KIM-1, the mapping of their binding sites, and their use in identifying various forms of the protein. We show that human KIM-1b is expressed in adult kidney cell lines, and we demonstrate that a soluble form of KIM-1 is shed constitutively into the culture medium of the cell lines expressing endogenous or recombinant KIM-1b by membrane-proximal cleavage. A monoclonal antibody that binds at or close to the proteolytic site can partially block the shedding of KIM-1. Release of soluble KIM-1 is enhanced by activating the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and can be inhibited with two metalloproteinase inhibitors, BB-94 (Batimastat) and GM6001 (Ilomastat), suggesting that the cleavage is mediated by a metalloproteinase. We propose that the shedding of KIM-1 in the kidney undergoing regeneration constitutes an active mechanism allowing dedifferentiated regenerating cells to scatter on denuded patches of the basement membrane and reconstitute a continuous epithelial layer.

Morphologic characteristics of injury to the proximal tubule epithelial cell include loss of proximal tubular brush border, loss of cellular polarity, dedifferentiation, and apoptosis. With advanced injury, viable and necrotic tubular epithelial cells detach from the basement membrane and contribute to intraluminal obstruction. Surviving dedifferentiated cells spread over the denuded basement membrane, undergo mitogenesis, and ultimately redifferentiate and reestablish normal epithelial polarity resulting in a normal functional epithelium (1Sheridan A.M. Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 2Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). Although these processes are well described at the histopathological level, very little is known about the molecular factors that regulate these events. One of the genes identified from postischemic rat kidney by representational difference analysis (3Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) was designated kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1)1 (4Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V. Bailly V. Wei H. Hession C.A. Cate R.L. Sanicola M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4135-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). This gene encodes a type I cell membrane glycoprotein containing, in its extracellular portion, a six-cysteine immunoglobulin-like domain and a Thr/Ser-Pro-rich domain characteristic of mucin-likeO-glycosylated proteins. Immunoglobulin-like domains have been widely implicated in mediating protein-protein interaction (5Barclay A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14672-14674Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in particular at the cell surface where they are responsible for cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The mucin domain, which extends the Ig-like domain away from the cell surface like a stalk, could play a dual role of configuration and protection (6Jentoft N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 291-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) as well as being involved in cell adhesion. Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1, for example, binds to L-selectin (CD62 ligand) via its mucin domain and interacts with α4β7integrin via its Ig domain (7Berg E.L. McEvoy L.M. Berlin C. Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain of KIM-1 is relatively short and possesses a potential phosphorylation site, indicating that KIM-1 may be a signaling molecule. Rat KIM-1 mRNA and protein levels are dramatically up-regulated in the postischemic kidney. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that KIM-1 is expressed in dedifferentiated proximal tubular epithelial cells in damaged regions, especially in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule in the outer stripe of the outer medulla, a region that is highly susceptible to injury as a result of ischemia or toxins (4Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V. Bailly V. Wei H. Hession C.A. Cate R.L. Sanicola M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4135-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Because KIM-1 colocalizes with markers of proliferation, we propose that KIM-1 plays a role in the regeneration process. The first identified homolog of KIM-1 was an African green monkey protein cloned as the receptor for hepatitis A virus (HAVcr-1) (8Kaplan G. Totsuka A. Thompson P. Akatsuka T. Moritsugu Y. Feinstone S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4282-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Two human homologs of KIM-1 were subsequently cloned from kidney and liver. One was cloned as the homolog of KIM-1 (4Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V. Bailly V. Wei H. Hession C.A. Cate R.L. Sanicola M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4135-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), and the other one was cloned as the homolog of HAVcr-1 (9Feigelstock D. Thompson P. Mattoo P. Zhang Y. Kaplan G.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We refer to them as KIM-1a and KIM-1b, respectively. These two human homologs are identical except for the C-terminal portion of their cytoplasmic domain (Fig.1 A). Analysis of their genomic structure and cDNA products indicates that they are splice variants and reveals that KIM-1a is the major form in liver, and KIM-1b is predominant in kidney. 2V. Bailly, Z. Shao, M. Sanicola, J. V. Bonventre, and R. Cate, unpublished data. 2V. Bailly, Z. Shao, M. Sanicola, J. V. Bonventre, and R. Cate, unpublished data. The murine KIM-1 homolog was identified recently and shown to belong to a family of three highly related genes expressed on activated T cells and located on chromosome 11 in a locus genetically linked to airway hyperreactivity. This region of the mouse genome is homologous to a region of the human chromosome 5q which includes the human KIM-1 gene and has also been linked to atopy and asthma (10Wills-Karp M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 11McIntire J.J. Umetsu S.E. Akbari O. Potter M. Kuchroo V.K. Barsh G.S. Freeman G.J. Umetsu D.T. DeKruyff R.H. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 1109-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). So, in addition to participating in restoring a functional renal epithelium, KIM-1 might play an important role in the immune response. A number of membrane proteins have soluble forms that are released into the extracellular space. Although these soluble forms can result from alternative splicing, they more often derive from proteolysis of the membrane form. The cleavage occurs close to the transmembrane domain releasing physiologically active protein. These proteins are diverse in structure and function and include cytokines, growth factors, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and enzymes (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 13Heaney M.L. Golde D.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 847-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Beer S. Oleszewski M. Gutwein P. Geiger C. Altevogt P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many reported cases of shedding, inhibition by hydroxamic acid-based zinc metalloproteinase inhibitors has indicated that the cleaving enzymes or “sheddases” could be matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (12Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) or members of the ADAM (a desintegrin and metalloproteinase) family (15Lum L. Wong B.R. Josien R.

One of the most notorious and best characterized sheddases to date is the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE), an ADAM family member (ADAM17). Genetic deletion of TACE in mouse confers embryonic lethality, revealing the importance of protein sheddingin vivo. The lack of functional TACE abolishes the shedding of not only tumor necrosis factor-α but also L-selectin, transforming growth factor-α, tumor necrosis factor receptor, the amyloid precursor protein, fractalkine, and others, indicating that TACE is a sheddase with multiple substrates (17Peschon J.J.

In this paper, we report the creation of a number of mAbs specific to the human KIM-1 extracellular domain and characterize the region to which they bind. Using these antibodies, we show that cells expressing endogenous or recombinant human KIM-1b constitutively shed the KIM-1 ectodomain into the extracellular milieu and that the release of soluble KIM-1 can be blocked with two different MMP inhibitors or with an antibody that binds to the proteolytic site. We also show that shedding of KIM-1 is increased in the presence of PMA and that both basal and PMA-activated shedding of KIM-1 are inhibited by BB-94. The possible relevance of KIM-1 shedding in kidney disease, including renal carcinoma, is discussed. PMA (Sigma) was diluted into fresh medium from a stock solution at 1 mg/ml made in dimethyl sulfoxide. GM6001 (Chemicon International) and BB-94 (British Biotech Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.) also know as Ilomastat and Batimastat, respectively, were diluted from 2.5 mm stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide into fresh medium to concentrations ranging from 16 to 0.5 μm. The 18-mer peptides used for the mapping of the mAb binding sites were purchased from Research Genetics and resuspended to a concentration of 5 mg/ml (stock solutions). To obtain soluble forms of human KIM-1 protein, a construct (KIM1-Ig) was made in which the extracellular domain of human KIM-1 (residues 1–290) was attached to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (hinge, CH2 + CH3 domains) and cloned into pEAG347, a BIOGEN mammalian expression plasmid containing a tandem promoter (SV40 early/adenovirus major late) for constitutive expression and the dihydrofolate reductase gene for methotrexate selection of stably expressing cell lines. Transfected Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing the fusion proteins were selected, adapted in suspension, and grown in fermentors. Another soluble form of KIM-1 (hKIM1(mucinΔ)-Ig) was made in which only the Ig-like domain (residues 1–135) was fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1. This fusion protein was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The KIM1-Ig fusion proteins were purified from conditioned media by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A human KIM-1b full-length cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using mRNA from the human carcinoma cell line 769-P and primers designed from the published DNA sequence (9Feigelstock D. Thompson P. Mattoo P. Zhang Y. Kaplan G.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the cDNA obtained was identical to that of the HAVcr-1 cDNA obtained from human kidney and liver (9Feigelstock D. Thompson P. Mattoo P. Zhang Y. Kaplan G.G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four mice were immunized with human KIM1-Ig. The increase of the antibody titer against human KIM-1 was monitored by ELISA. The mouse that showed the best response was selected and boosted with the protein prior to the fusion. Dissociated spleen cells were fused with FL653 myeloma cells and plated into 96-well tissue culture plates in selection medium. Wells positive for growth were screened by ELISA for expression of antibody against human KIM-1. Ten hybridoma clones were selected and subcloned. Four of them (ABE3, ACA12, AKG7, and ARD5) were grown in the peritoneal cavity of mice. The ascitic fluid was collected, and each antibody was purified by chromatography using protein A-Sepharose. Biotinylated AKG7 and ARD5 were prepared by direct binding of amino-reactive sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). The antibodies were isotyped using the IsoStrip mouse mAb isotyping kit. A synthetic peptide (CKEVQAEDNIYIENSLYATD; Research Genetics) corresponding to the last 19 amino acid residues at the C terminus of the human KIM-1b (Fig.1 A), plus a cysteine residue for the conjugation, was used to raise polyclonal antibodies. The peptide was conjugated to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), and the conjugate was used to immunize a rabbit. Antisera were collected after several immunizations. Cell lines listed hereafter were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and grown as prescribed: 769-P (human renal cell adenocarcinoma; CRL-1933); HK-2 (human kidney proximal tubular cells immortalized by transduction with HPV-16; CRL-2190); 293 (embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus; CRL-1573); HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma; HB-8065). 769-P cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (complete medium). The serum was omitted in some short term shedding experiments to allow the concentration of the conditioned medium and subsequent analysis by Western blotting. For transient expression of human recombinant KIM-1b, COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of plasmid DNA/106 cells. Transfected cells were plated and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. After 4 h of incubation to allow the cells to attach, the medium was replaced. Cell confluence was then ∼20%. Live cells were stained with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) that was reduced in the mitochondria to a colored formazan product. The staining was done by adding 100 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT/ml of cell culture and incubating for 3 h at 37 °C. The formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 1 ml of 10% SDS, 10 mm HCl and incubating at room temperature with gentle agitation for 24 h. Absorbance at 570 nm was quantitated. To assess the binding of anti-human KIM-1 mAbs, ARD5 and ABE3, to cell surface KIM-1, growing 769-P cells were lifted from a flask with EDTA, washed with FACS buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3 in PBS), distributed in tubes (0.5 × 106/tube), and pelleted (5 min at 200 ×g). The cells were then successively resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer, incubated 30 min on ice with anti-KIM-1 mAb (1–125 μg/ml in FACS buffer), washed twice with 2 ml of FACS buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG, Fab'2 (Molecular Probes) diluted 200-fold and incubated again for 30 min on ice. After one final wash, the cells were resuspended in 50 μl of FACS buffer and 50 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (for fixation). Cell sorting was done on 10,000 cells with a FACSCalibur machine (Becton Dickinson) and the data was processed with the Cellquest analysis software (Becton Dickinson). To compare the relative densities of KIM-1 at the surface of 769-P cells growing in wells and treated with various concentrations of ABE3 or a control antibody, cells were lifted with EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation (5 min at 200 × g). Cells were then successfully resuspended in 100 μl of FACS buffer containing 5 μg/ml of biotinylated ARD5, incubated 30 min on ice, washed with 2 ml of FACS buffer, resuspended in 100 μl of phycoerythrin-streptavidin conjugate diluted 200-fold in FACS buffer, and incubated again 30 min on ice. After one final wash, the cells were resuspended in 50 μl of FACS buffer. Cell sorting was done as described previously. Cells were grown in the wells of eight-chamber slides until they reached ∼30% confluence. They were washed with medium, then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with ABE3 at 50 μg/ml or ARD5 at 2 μg/ml in serum-containing medium. After one wash with medium followed by two washes with PBS to remove unbound antibodies, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min at room temperature). The cells were washed again twice with PBS and once with a solution of 2% goat serum in PBS, incubated 10 min at room temperature in that same last solution and then 30 min with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG, Fab′2 (diluted 200-fold). After three washes with the 2% goat serum solution, the chambers were peeled off, and the slides were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). 769-P cells were grown in two flasks until 30% confluence. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. After three washes with 10 mmglycine in PBS, medium was added to one flask for an additional day of culture while the cells of the other flask were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The conditioned medium from the reincubated flask was collected, and the cells were washed and lysed as described. The media and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and biotinylated proteins were extracted with streptavidin-agarose beads (Novagen). After overnight reaction at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Aliquots of the lysates and the streptavidin-extracted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting as described below. 769-P cells were seeded in 6-cm tissue culture dishes and cultured in complete medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum) until cells reached 80–90% confluence. Cells were washed twice with pulse labeling medium (cysteine-deficient RPMI supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum) and incubated in this medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then labeled for 2 h with 200 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine in pulse labeling medium and chased for the indicated times in complete medium (2 ml/dish). The conditioned media were collected at the end of the chase, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of cold PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 400 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μm leupeptin. One-ml aliquots of the conditioned media were incubated for 1 h on ice with 1.5 μg of AKG7 mAb then mixed with protein G-agarose to collect the immune complexes. After a preadsorption step on normal rabbit IgG-agarose beads, the cell lysates were incubated with anti-KIM-1b C-terminal peptide rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 1 h on ice, followed by separation with protein A-agarose. The 35S-labeled proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Conditioned media samples were clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 16,000 × g). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, and extracts were prepared either by direct in situ lysis of the cells grown in wells or by lysis of the cells that had been scraped from the surface of a flask with a rubber policeman and pelleted in a tube. In situ lysis was done by adding 250 μl of lysis buffer to each well of a six-well plate. Cells from flasks were harvested with a rubber policeman in ice-cold PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and spun down at 2,000 × g. The cell pellet was weighed and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 μl of lysis solution/mg of cell pellet). After 5 min of lysis on ice, the extracts were clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 16,000 × g). Samples (extracts and conditioned media) were mixed with reducing loading buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Reduced denatured proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose sheet. The blot was blocked with a solution of 5% non-fat dry milk (Carnation) in PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20) and probed in the same solution with the murine mAb AKG7 or ABE3 (at 1 μg/ml) or with the rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the C-terminal peptide of KIM-1b (diluted 1,000-fold), followed by either goat anti-murine or goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Washes between the steps were done with PBST. Reactive bands were revealed by chemiluminescence. To characterize the binding of anti-KIM-1 mAbs, wells were coated by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of antigen (peptide or hKIM1-Ig fusion protein) in 50 mmsodium carbonate, pH 9.6. Potential remaining adsorption sites were blocked by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 400 μl of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). The wells were first incubated with the mAbs at various concentrations (from 1 μg/ml to 1 ng/ml) then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat polyclonal antibodies against mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) both diluted in blocking buffer. Plates were washed four times with PBST after each reaction step. The color reaction was carried out with tetramethylbenzidine and stopped with H2SO4. To measure the concentration of soluble KIM-1 in conditioned medium, wells coated with ARD5 were incubated successively with the medium samples or KIM1-Ig standard diluted in blocking buffer, biotinylated AKG7, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Plates were washed four times with PBST after each reaction step. The color reaction was carried out with tetramethylbenzidine and stopped with H2SO4. The experiment of KIM-1 shedding inhibition by ABE3 was done with 769-P cells grown in six-well plates to about 80% confluence. Cells were incubated in serum-containing medium supplemented with various concentrations of ABE3 or mouse IgG (Sigma). After 6 h of incubation, the conditioned media were collected, clarified by centrifugation (5 min at 16,000 × g), and soluble KIM-1 was quantified by ELISA. The cells were lifted with EDTA and analyzed by FACS to compare the relative densities of cell surface KIM-1. Shedding inhibition with BB-94 and GM6001 was evaluated with 769-P cells grown in six-well plates to about 50% confluence. After two washes with fresh medium, the culture was continued in medium containing various concentrations of BB-94 or GM6001 (0.25–16 μm) for the indicated times. Serum-containing medium was used for the 18-h inhibition study, and soluble KIM-1 released into the conditioned media was quantified by ELISA. Serum-free medium was used for the 1-h inhibition study. The conditioned media samples, supplemented with protease inhibitors and concentrated 12-fold (Microcon 30; Millipore), and the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. A 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation was used to concentrate and partially purify the recombinant human KIM-1 shed into the culture medium. The protein pellet was resuspended in PBS containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and dialyzed against PBS. The sample clarified by centrifugation was mixed overnight at 4 °C with ARD5 and goat anti-mouse IgG beads (Sigma). The beads were drained and washed successively with PBS, PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, and 0.1m MES, pH 5.1. KIM-1 was then eluted with 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.5. The proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. After one wash with acetone, the protein pellet was dried and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The sample was run by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band corresponding to shed KIM-1 was excised. The membrane strip was loaded onto a gas phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 470). The phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) amino acids were analyzed on-line with a PTH Analyzer (Applied Biosystems 120A) equipped with a PTH C18 column. To obtain highly specific antibodies against the human KIM-1 protein, murine mAbs were generated against the extracellular domain and characterized by ELISA and Western blot (Table I). Four of the mAbs (ABE3, AKG7, ACA12, and ATE11) failed to bind the KIM-1 fusion protein lacking the mucin domain (hKIM1(mucinΔ)-Ig), indicating that their respective binding epitopes should be at least partly in the mucin domain. In addition, these four antibodies are the only ones that react with the reduced denatured hKIM1-Ig on Western blot, suggesting that their respective epitopes might correspond to a single stretch of amino acid residues in the protein primary structure. We tested by ELISA the binding of AKG7, ACA12, and ABE3 to eight overlapping synthetic 18-mer peptides starting at KIM-1 residue 210 in the mucin domain and ending at residue 290, the last residue of the extracellular domain (Fig. 2,A and B). Both AKG7 and ACA12 were found to bind to peptides 45 and 46, and although they show some difference in their respective affinities, one can conclude that both must bind an epitope within the 9-residue sequence stretch common to peptide 45 and 46 (Fig.2 B). This peptide stretch LQGAIRREP does not carry any putative sites for either N- or O-glycosylation, which suggests that ACA12 and AKG7 will thus be able to recognize the unglycosylated and the various glycosylated forms of the protein. ABE3, on the other hand, was found to bind to peptide 49 but not to overlapping peptides 48 and 50. Knowing that the longest linear peptide an antibody could possibly bind is approximately seven amino acid residue long, this suggests that the ABE3 binding site is within the sequence stretch centered on peptide 49 (Fig. 2 B). This sequence stretch, GLWNNNQTQLFL, in KIM-1 could potentially beN-glycosylated on the last asparagine residue. However because ABE3 binds to various glycosylated forms of KIM-1 as well as to the synthetic peptide, we can assume that the binding relies at least primarily on the interaction with the peptide component of the protein.Table ICharacterization of murine monoclonal antibodies against the human KIM-1 ectodomainBind Ig-like domainBind mucin domainClone and isotypeAUF1ASG1AMC12BIE6AWE2ARD5AKG7ACA12ABE3ATE11G1kG2bG1kG1kG1kG1kG1kG1kG1kG1kDetection of hKIM1-Ig by ELISA++++++++++Detection of hKIM1 (mucinΔ)-Ig by ELISA++++++−−−−Detection of reduced hKIM1-Ig by Western blotting−−−−−−++++Detection of nonreduced hKIM1-Ig by Western blotting++++++++++The class, subclass, and light chain type of each antibody were determined using an isotyping kit.

In this design, heterodimer formation is specified through the placement of charged residues at the e and g positions of the heptad repeat such that the E coil contains all glutamic acid residues at these positions, and the K coil contains all lysine residues at these positions. The affinity and stability of the E/K coil have been modified to allow a greater range of conditions for association and dissociation. Increasing the hydrophobicity of the coiled-coil core, by substituting isoleucine for valine, gave increases in stability of 2.81 and 3.73 kcal/mol (0.47 kcal/mol/substitution). Increasing the α-helical propensity of residues outside the core, by substituting alanine for serine, yielded increases in stability of 2.68 and 3.28 kcal/mol (0.41 and 0.45 kcal/mol/substitution). These sequence changes yielded a series of heterodimeric coiled-coils whose stabilities varied from 6.8 to 11.2 kcal/mol, greatly expanding their scope for use in protein engineering and biomedical applications.

Recent surveys of genomic data bases suggest that up to 10% of eukaryotic proteins contain sequences predicted to be coiled-coils (5Liu J. Rost B. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1970-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This structural motif has been of considerable interest, both because of its diversity in structure and oligomerization state and because of its many advantages as a model system for protein design (6Hodges R.S.

Coiled-coils contain a single type of secondary structure, the α-helix, which is easy to monitor experimentally by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Their quaternary interactions yield a structure that is folded stably in aqueous solution at neutral pH, unlike most single-stranded α-helices.The structural features of coiled-coils have been reviewed extensively (3Lupas A.

Their sequences are characterized by a heptad repeat, denoted abcdefg, in which positions a andd are occupied by hydrophobic residues. The side chains from the a and d residues pack against each other in a “knobs-into-holes” manner (9Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-698Crossref Google Scholar), forming a continuous hydrophobic core. Maintaining this packing along the length of the α-helices results in their wrapping around each other in a left-handed supercoil. The side chains of the residues in positions e andg lie alongside the hydrophobic core. These positions are typically occupied by charged residues that can participate ini to i′+5 electrostatic interactions, which have been found to play an important role in specifying homo- and heteroassociation in native coiled-coils (1Burkhard P.

They can be composed of two to five α-helices, which may be identical or different and may be arranged in a parallel or antiparallel manner. In addition, coiled-coils have been observed to assemble into larger structures, such as the α-sheets and α-cylinders described by Walshaw and Woolfson (23Walshaw J. Woolfson D.N. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

We have designed the E/K coil, a heterodimeric coiled-coil for use in biotechnological applications including as an expression and purification tag and as a universal dimerization domain for biosensors (14Chao H. Bautista D.L. Litowski J. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1998; 715: 307-329Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Tripet B., Yu, L. Bautista D.L. Wong W.Y. Irvin R.T. Hodges R.S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12175-12185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization is based on the placement of charged residues at the e andg positions. This system has several advantages, including its high stability and specificity. However, the affinity chromatography procedure required an elution buffer that was both acidic and contained a high percentage of acetonitrile. This procedure worked very well, but more benign elution conditions may be desired for some applications. Therefore, we have modified this design to obtain a set of heterodimerization domains with a range of stabilities and affinities. This will increase the flexibility of this design and allow users to tailor the E/K system for a particular application. Our first approach was to change the length of the coiled-coil peptides (39Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We found a direct but nonlinear relationship between chain length and stability. The reduction from 5 to 4 heptads length yielded a useful E/K analog with a free energy of unfolding (ΔG H2O) of 8.2 kcal/mol. The 3-heptad analog, however, was too labile and was only able to fold when stabilized by an interhelical disulfide bond.In the present study, we examine sequence modifications designed to stabilize the coiled-coils, making the shorter E/K analogs more useful. The first approach was to increase the hydrophobicity of residues in the coiled-coil hydrophobic core, which has been shown to be closely related to coiled-coil stability (40Cedervall T. Johansson M.U. Åkerström B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4987-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol.

The second approach was to increase the α-helical propensity of residues outside the coiled-coil interface. Helical propensity differences have been shown to affect coiled-coil stability up to 0.77 kcal/mol/substitution (44O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) and up to 0.96 kcal/mol/substitution in a single-stranded amphipathic α-helix (45Zhou N.E. Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Protein Pept. Lett. 1994; 1: 114-119Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have designed a set of heterodimeric coiled-coils with a wide variety of stabilities by modifying three parameters: hydrophobicity, α-helical propensity, and chain length. Residues in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils (positions a and d) have been shown to play key roles in determining such characteristics as stability, oligomerization state, and hetero- versushomoassociation (41Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 42Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C. Hodges R.S.

Protein Res. 1992; 40: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Single substitutions in thea and d positions of coiled-coils have yielded a series of coiled-coils whose stabilities covered a range of 7 kcal/mol (41Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 42Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C. Hodges R.S.

We compared the effects of valine and isoleucine in position a while position d was constantly occupied by leucine. The side chains of these residues differ in terms of side chain length (one methylene group) and therefore hydrophobicity. Numerous hydrophobicity scales of the amino acid side chains have been developed, based on partitioning between water and organic solvents, RP-HPLC retention behavior, and calculations of solvent-accessible surface area (for reviews, see Refs. 71Cornette J.L. Cease K.B. Margalit H. Spouge J.L. Berzofsky J.A. DeLisi C. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 659-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar and 72Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The relative rankings of the amino acids vary between scales, but isoleucine and valine are always classified as strong hydrophobes, and isoleucine is always the more hydrophobic of the two. The difference between these residues has been measured to be 0.40–0.80 kcal/mol (72Karplus P.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 73Eisenberg D. McLachlan A.D. Nature. 1986; 319: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar, 74Fauchère J. Pliska V. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 18: 369-375Google Scholar) and to cause an increase in the RP-HPLC retention time of 1.8 min (56Monera O.D. Sereda T.J. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In our E/K coil heterodimers, each substitution of isoleucine for valine yielded an increase in stability of 0.47 kcal/mol (TableIV). This is well within the range given by the different hydrophobicity tables.What effect have similar substitutions had in other coiled-coils? Zhuet al. (43Zhu B.-Y. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) compared coiled-coils in which the central 3 heptads (of 5) had leucine, isoleucine, or valine in the aposition. They found that isoleucine was more stabilizing than valine by 0.45 kcal/mol when the coiled-coil was stabilized by a disulfide bridge, and by 0.88 kcal/mol in the reduced peptides. This is a larger effect per substitution than we observed, but still within a comparable range. When a single mutation is made in the hydrophobic core of a well packed protein, the environment surrounding the substitution site can have a significant effect on the degree of stabilization or destabilization observed. These effects are often referred to as context effects and are complicated by the ability of the side chains and the protein backbone to accommodate the substitution through conformational adjustments. Because of this, the contribution of a single methylene group to stability has been observed to vary from 0.1 to 1.5 kcal/mol (67Jelesarov I. Bosshard H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 75Fersht A.R. Serrano L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 75-83Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have examined the contribution of an extra side chain methylene group from multiple substitutions along the entire hydrophobic core. This eliminates most context effects, so the differences in stability which we have measured are primarily the result of the hydrophobicity differences between isoleucine and valine.The second modification to our design was to substitute alanine for serine in position b, significantly increasing the α-helical propensity of the sequence. Serine and threonine are thought to have low α-helical propensities because their side chain hydroxyl groups compete with the peptide backbone for hydrogen bonds (76Chakrabartty A. Baldwin R.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 141-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The helical propensity of a series of basic side chains increased as their side chain length increased, suggesting that the presence of polar or charged groups near the peptide backbone is destabilizing (77Padmanabhan S. York E.J. Stewart J.M. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A survey of helical propensity scales showed a surprisingly poor correlation between different scales (78Krittanai C. Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 2000; 39: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); however, alanine always ranks near the top of the scales and always has a greater helical propensity than serine does. We found that a serine to alanine substitution gave increases in stability of 0.41–0.45 kcal/mol (TableIV). This is in very good agreement with the results of O'Neil and DeGrado (44O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), who found a difference of 0.42 kcal/mol between serine and alanine in a coiled-coil model system. Studies in single-stranded α-helices have given helical propensity differences of 0.5–0.8 kcal/mol for a serine to alanine substitution (45Zhou N.E. Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Protein Pept. Lett. 1994; 1: 114-119Google Scholar, 54Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 55Lyu P.C. Liff M.I. Marky L.A.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1264-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Helical propensity effects appear to be greater in single amphipathic α-helices than in coiled-coils presumably because of the additional stabilizing interactions available to coiled-coils (80Kwok, S. C., Mant, C. T., Hodges, R. S., Peptides 1998: Proceedings of the 25th European Peptide Symposium, Bajusz, S., Hudecz, F., 1998, 34, 35, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.Google Scholar).The third aspect of our design was to reduce the chain length to 3 and 4 heptads (21 and 28 residues). Increases in chain length have been observed to cause increases in coiled-coil stability, but the relationship has been found to be nonlinear (39Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 81Su J.Y. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15501-15510Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The greatest stability gains were observed at chain lengths of 3 heptads; further increases in length were stabilizing but to lesser degrees. This is primarily because of end fraying, a partial and temporary unfolding of the helix termini (52Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2664-2670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 82Goodman E.M. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11615-11620Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 83Holtzer M.E. Lovett E.G. d'Avignon A. Holtzer A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We found that an increase from 3 to 4 heptads caused an increase in stability of 4.06 kcal/mol for the ISAL sequence and an increase of 3.86 kcal/mol for the VAAL sequence. This is in good agreement with our previous results, in which an increase from 4 to 5 heptads in length for the VSAL sequence gave an increase in stability of 4.34 kcal/mol (39Litowski J.R.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2824-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Careful double mutant cycle analysis has shown that i toi′+5 electrostatic attractions between glutamic acid and lysine are stabilizing by ∼0.50 kcal/mol (10Kohn W.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 993-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 88Krylov D. Barchi J. Vinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The destabilizing effect of electrostatic repulsions is well established. A singlei to i′+5 electrostatic repulsion between glutamic acid residues has been shown to be destabilizing by 0.4–0.8 kcal/mol (17Kohn W.D. Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25495-25506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 88Krylov D. Barchi J. Vinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 959-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, electrostatic interactions have the potential to play a critical role in structural specificity.These results illustrate the need to balance stability and specificity, an important principle in protein design. When we maximized the stability of our design, with IAAL E4/K4, its specificity was lost, as seen in the large amount of homodimer formed (Fig. 2 H). In this case, the E4/E4 and K4/K4 homodimers were stable enough to tolerate the destabilizing effect of eight electrostatic repulsions. In nature, many interactions that specify particular coiled-coil oligomerization states are destabilizing. Examples include the presence of asparagine in the hydrophobic core of the GCN4 coiled-coil (51Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) and glutamic acid in the core of Max/c-Myc (12Lavigne P. Kondejewski L.H. Houston Jr., M.E. Sönnichsen F.D. Lix B. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 505-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Charged residues, though typically destabilizing in the hydrophobic core of coiled-coils, can specify a single oligomerization state (41Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 42Wagschal K. Tripet B. Lavigne P. Mant C. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2312-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).In summary, we have created a series of heterodimeric coiled-coils whose conformational stabilities range from 6.8 to 11.2 kcal/mol (TableIII). This expands the potential for tailoring heterodimerization domains to particular applications. For example, we can now develop an expression tag/affinity purification system that has more gentle elution conditions, extending the usefulness of this system to more sensitive proteins. The most promising of these heterodimerization domains is IAAL E3/K3. Despite its small size (3 heptads, or 21 residues), it is a fully folded coiled-coil with a high conformational stability ([GdnHCl]1/2 = 4.3 m, ΔG H2O = 9.6 kcal/mol) and small dissociation constant (70 nm). It is highly specific because there is no sign of homodimer formation in either the E or the K coil. We have significantly reduced the net charge (+3 on K coil and −3 on E coil versus +5 on K coil and −5 on E coil) and hydrophobicity (6 a andd position hydrophobic residues versus 10) compared with the original 5-heptad design. This reduced size is an advantage for the expression of recombinant proteins for biophysical studies, in which nonnative residues can complicate results. The smaller the tag, the less likely it is to affect the conformation, function, and biophysical properties of the recombinant protein. Smaller tags are therefore advantageous for the many researchers who do not remove expression tags before characterization of recombinant proteins. We have also shown that the design of our heterodimeric coiled-coil has considerable flexibility, and its stability can be modulated. This is a considerable advantage compared with expression tags based on native protein sequences, which are much less amenable to redesign. The coiled-coil is an oligomerization domain found in a wide variety of proteins, including transcription factors, motor proteins, chaperone proteins, and viral fusion proteins (1Burkhard P.

Recent surveys of genomic data bases suggest that up to 10% of eukaryotic proteins contain sequences predicted to be coiled-coils (5Liu J. Rost B. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1970-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This structural motif has been of considerable interest, both because of its diversity in structure and oligomerization state and because of its many advantages as a model system for protein design (6Hodges R.S.

Coiled-coils contain a single type of secondary structure, the α-helix, which is easy to monitor experimentally by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Their quaternary interactions yield a structure that is folded stably in aqueous solution at neutral pH, unlike most single-stranded α-helices. The structural features of coiled-coils have been reviewed extensively (3Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 7Kohn W.D.

They are both long-chain β-diols, and their biosynthetic pathway is beginning to be elucidated. Although the two classes of molecules share a common lipid core, phthiocerol diesters have been found in all the strains of the M. tuberculosis complex examined although phenolphthiocerol diesters are produced by only a few groups of strains. To address the question of the origin of this diversity 8 reference strains and 10 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis were analyzed. We report the presence of glycosylated p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl esters, structurally related to the type-specific phenolphthiocerol glycolipids, in the culture media of all reference strains of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that the strains devoid of phenolphthiocerol derivatives are unable to elongate the putativep-hydroxybenzoic acid precursor. We also show that all the strains of M. tuberculosis examined and deficient in the production of phenolphthiocerol derivatives are natural mutants with a frameshift mutation in pks15/1 whereas a single open reading frame for pks15/1 is found in Mycobacterium bovis BCG, M. leprae, and strains of M. tuberculosis that produce phenolphthiocerol derivatives. Complementation of the H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis,which is devoid of phenolphthiocerol derivatives, with the fusedpks15/1 gene from M. bovis BCG restored phenolphthiocerol glycolipids production.

Based on the data accumulated during the last decades, the mycobacterial envelope appears to play a fundamental role in the physiology of these bacteria, both in terms of pathogenicity and resistance to antibiotics. This envelope is singular and differs from those of other bacteria by both its molecular composition and the architectural arrangement of its constituents (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Phys. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key feature of the mycobacterial envelope is its high lipid content, up to 60% of the dry weight of the bacteria (2Goren M.B. Brennan P.J. Youmans G.P. Tuberculosis. WB Saunders, Philadelphia1979: 62-193Google Scholar). Another distinctive feature resides in the variety of lipid compounds with unusual structures, many of them being unique to mycobacteria (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Phys. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this singularity, genome sequence data for several mycobacterial species reveal that a large portion of the genes may be involved in lipid metabolism (∼250 genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis) (3Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

Therefore there is a large avenue for future research toward the definition of the biological functions of specific lipids, some of them important for pathogenicity. Understanding the biosynthetic pathways leading to the production of virulence factors or essential components of the cell envelope may help to identify new targets for the development of antituberculous drugs and represents an important post-genomic challenge for the near future. Among the few genes that have been clearly associated with a defined metabolic pathway in M. tuberculosis and shown to play a role in the pathogenicity of the tubercle bacillus are the cluster of genes involved in the biosynthesis of phthiocerol and phenolphthiocerol dimycocerosates (4Camacho L.R. Constant P. Raynaud C. Lanéelle M.-A. Triccas J.-A. Gicquel B. Daffé M. Guilhot C. J. Biol.

These compounds and their relatives are constituents of the mycobacterial cell envelope produced by only some of the slow growers in particular the major pathogens such as Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium ulcerans,Mycobacterium marinum, and members of the M. tuberculosis complex (7Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). Phthiocerol and its relatives consist of a long-chain β-diol, which occurs naturally as diesters of polymethyl-branched fatty acids (Fig. 1). According to the mycobacterial strain, the asymmetric centers bearing the methyl branches in these fatty acids may be of the d- or the l-series and are known as mycocerosates and phthioceranates, respectively (7Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2049-2055PubMed Google Scholar). The mycobacterial species that produce phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIMs)1 or phthiocerol diphthioceranates (DIPs) may also synthesize structurally related substances, called phenolphthiocerol and its relatives, in which the lipid core is ω-terminated by an aromatic nucleus, probably derived from p-hydroxybenzoic acid (see Ref. 1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Phys. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these substances the hydroxyl group of the phenol moiety is usually glycosylated by a type- or species-specific mono-, tri-, or tetra-saccharide unit (8Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial lipids. 1. Academic Press, London1988: 203-298Google Scholar, 9Daffé M. Lemassu A. Doyle R.J. Glycomicrobiology. Plenum Press, 2000: 225-273Google Scholar) leading to phenolphthiocerol glycolipids, also called phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) (Fig. 1). Numerous studies have established the usefulness of PGLs, notably PGL-1 from M. leprae, in the serodiagnosis of leprosy and tuberculosis (10Gaylord H. Brennan P.J. Am. Rev.

Dis. 1995; 14: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition some of these glycolipids exhibit biological activities in vitrothat may be relevant to the pathogenesis of mycobacterial infections. For instance, PGL-1 from M. leprae has been reported to inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes after stimulation with concanavalin A (14Mehra V. Brennan P.J. Rada E. Convit J. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1984; 308: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar); this observation has been extended to PGLs produced by other mycobacterial species (15Fournié J.-J. Adams E. Mullins R.J. Basten A. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 3653-3659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PGL-1 seems to be associated with resistance to intracellular killing by macrophages (16Neill M.A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and promotes phagocytosis of M. leprae by macrophages and Schwann cells through binding, respectively, to complement component C3 or laminin-2 (17Schlesinger L.S.

Cell. 2000; 103: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Recently, the molecular basis of the interaction between M. leprae and Schwann cells was established: the saccharide moiety of PGL-1 binds the α2LG1, α2LG4, and α2LG5 modules of the peripheral nerve laminin α2 chain (18Ng V.

The structural similarities between DIMs, DIPs, phenolphthiocerol derivatives, and PGLs have led the proposal of a biosynthesis pathway for these diols involving a common branch in which two different precursors, either C22-C24 fatty acid orp-hydroxyphenylalkanoic acid, are elongated by three malonyl-CoA and two methylmalonyl-CoA units to yield a common lipid core (Fig. 1) (19Azad A.K.

This postulate was supported by the identification in the Mycobacterium bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis genomes of a group of 5 polyketide synthase genes (named ppsA-E) that contain the domains required for these sequential elongation steps. As predicted, disruption ofppsB and ppsC in M. bovis BCG led to a mutant strain unable to synthesize PGLs or DIMs (19Azad A.K. Sirakova T.D. Fernandes N.D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol.

In species that produce DIMs or DIPs, all the strains do so; however many of these strains do not contain phenolphthiocerol derivatives (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol.

For instance, phenolphthiocerol derivatives are produced by only a few strains of M. tuberculosis, notably those belonging to the subspecies M. tuberculosisCanetti (24Daffé M. Lacave C.

Dis. 1991; 163: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We investigated the intraspecies differences in the production of PGLs in M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate the occurrence of glycosylated p-hydroxybenzoic acid methyl esters structurally related to the type-specific PGLs in the culture media of all the strains of M. tuberculosis, suggesting that the strains devoid of phenolphthiocerol derivatives are unable to elongate the putative p-hydroxybenzoic acid precursor (p-HBA). We also provide evidence that the polyketide synthase gene pks15/1 is involved in the elongation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (p-HBAD) to form p-hydroxyphenylalkanoates, which in turn are converted, presumably by the PpsA-E synthase, to phenolphthiocerol derivatives. This demonstration is based on the observation that: (i) p-hydroxybenzoate derivatives are produced in every tested strains of M. tuberculosis, (ii) that the disruption of the pks15/1 gene ofM. bovis BCG abolished the production of the M. bovis-specific PGL but not that of DIMs, and (iii) that the production of PGL-tb by M. tuberculosis H37Rv can be restored by introducing the pks15/1 gene ofM. bovis BCG. Consistent with this result is the finding that strains of M. tuberculosis devoid of PGL are natural mutants with a frameshift mutation inpks15/1. M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294), H37Ra (ATCC 25177), Erdman (ATCC 35801), R1Rv (ATCC 35818), R1Ra (ATCC 35819), Canetti (Collection Institut Pasteur 140010059), Mt103 (a clinical isolate from Institut Pasteur, Paris), and M. bovis BCG 1173P2 (the Pasteur strain) were grown at 37 °C on Sauton's medium as surface biofilm for biochemical analyses. M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG were also grown on Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase) and 0.05% Tween 80 where indicated, or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). Kanamycin (km), hygromycin (Hyg), and sucrose were added when required to final concentrations of 40 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, and 2% (w/v), respectively. Ten additional M. tuberculosis strains (kindly provided by Dr. V. Vincent, Pasteur Institute, Paris) were also grown on Lowenstein Jensen slants at 37 °C for sequencing analysis and PGLs production analysis. Mycobacterial DNA was extracted from 5 ml of saturated cultures as described previously (26Belisle J.T. Sonnenberg M.G. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria protocols. 101. Humana Press Inc., Totowa1998: 31-44Google Scholar). DNA pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8) buffer. For sequencing of the pks15/1 junction in various mycobacterial strains, a loop full of bacteria from a Lowenstein Jensen slant was resuspended in 100 μl of deionized water and lysed by 5 cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and boiling. 5 μl of this crude extract was used to perform the PCR amplification. Primers used for PCR amplification of pks15/1 were pks1I (5′-GCAGGCGATGCGTCATGGGG-3′) and pks1J (5′-TCTTGCCCACCGACCCTGGC-3′). PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, FR), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mm each primer. The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, 30 s at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels. The 520-bp fragments were purified using the QiaQuick purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, FR) and sequenced using the same primers (ESGS Qbiogene, Evry, FR).

Sequences in the pks15/1 regions of M. tuberculosis and M. leprae were compared using the Blast 2 program (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60228) Google Scholar) at the Pasteur Institute website www.pasteur.fr. A DNA fragment from pks15/1 was amplified by PCR using M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA and primers pks1A (5′-GCTCAGAGTTTAAACCGAGCATGCCTTGTTGGG-3′) and pks1B (5′-GCTCTAGAGTTTAAACGCGTTTGCCGCCGAGTA-3′). The PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units ofTaq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, FR), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mm each primer. The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR product was analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. The ∼2.7-kb fragment was gel-purified using the QiaQuick gel extraction purification kit and inserted into the pGEM-T easy vector according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Lyon, FR) to give pCG125. A kanamycin resistance cassette formed by the Ωkm cassette from pHP45Ωkm (29Fellay R. Frey J. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) flanked by two res site from transposon γδ was inserted between the two XhoI sites ofpks15/1 generating a 1068-bp deletion. The resulting plasmid was named pCG134. The 4.5-kb PmeI fragment from pCG134 containing the disrupted pks15/1construct was inserted at the SmaI site of pJQ200 (30Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) leading to pWM08. M. bovis BCG was electrotransformed as previously described, and transformants were selected on 7H11+ADC+km (31Pelicic V. Reyrat J.-M. Gicquel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In three independent experiments a total of 76 kmR transformants were obtained and screened by PCR using primers pks1C (5′-CAGCGACGGCGGTTTTGGGA-3′), pks1D (5′-AGCCAGGACTGCAACACCTC-3′), pks1E (5′-ACCCCACGCCAGTGATATCC-3′), Ωkm1 (5′-GTGGATGACCTTTTGAATGACC-3′), Ωkm2 (5′-TTGGCGAAGTAATCGCAACATC-3′), res1 (5′-GCTCTAGAGCAACCGTCCGAAATATTATAAA-3′) or res2 (5′-GCTCTAGATCTCATAAAAATGTATCCTAAATCAAATATC-3′). The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. One clone gave the pattern corresponding to the insertion of pWM08 via a single homologous recombination event. This strain was renamed PMM1 and grown in 5 ml of 7H9, ADC, km, Tween at 37 °C until saturation. Dilutions of this culture were plated on 7H11, OADC, km, sucrose and incubated at 37 °C for 3 weeks. Four clones were then analyzed further. Saturated 5-ml liquid cultures of these four clones were prepared, and total DNA was extracted. The four DNA preparations were then analyzed using primers pks1C, pks1D, pks1E, res1, and res2. Plasmid pMIP12H is anEscherichia coli-mycobacteria shuttle vector derived from pAL5000. It contains an hygromycin resistance gene and a mycobacterial promotor, pBlaF*, upstream from a multicloning site itself upstream from a transcription terminator (32Le Dantec C. Winter N. Gicquel B. Vincent V. Picardeau M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2157-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To clone the genepks15/1 from M. bovis BCG, we used two different strategies. First the gene pks15/1 was amplified from M. bovis BCG as two fragments using primers pks15A (5′-GGACTAGTAGATCTATAGAGGAGCAACGGACGATG-3′) and pks1F (5′-GGACTAGTCCAGCAAAACGGCAGTCTCG-3′) for the 5′-end of the gene and pks1G (5′-GGACTAGTACCGAATGGGGATGCATCCG-3′) and pks1H (5′-GGACTAGTATGCAGGTTGATTGGATCACG-3′) for the 3′-end. The PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Lyon, FR), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mm of each primer. The amplification program consisted of one cycle of 10 min at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 57 °C and 5 min at 72 °C, and a final 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. The ∼3.4-kb and ∼2.9-kb fragments were gel-purified using the QiaQuick gel extraction purification kit. The 5′-PCR fragment was digested withBglII and SpeI and inserted between theBamHI and SpeI of pMIP12H to give pWM15. The 3′-PCR fragment was digested with NsiI and SpeI and ligated to pWM15 cut with NsiI and SpeI. The resulting plasmid, pWM16, contains the entirepks15/1 gene from M. bovis BCG under the control of the pBlaF* promotor and 7-bp downstream from a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. In the second strategy, we used the M. bovis BCG BAC library constructed by Brosch et al.(33Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Soravito C. Barrel B.G. Cole S.T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An 8-kbp fragment was obtained from BAC X203 following digestion with enzymes NruI and StuI. This fragment containing the entire pks15/1 gene from M. bovisBCG was gel-purified using QiaQuick gel extraction kit and inserted into pBluescript KS leading to pWM11. This plasmid was digested withSpeI and AseI and the 8.3-kbp fragment containing the entire pks15/1 gene was gel-purified and cloned into pMIP12H digested with SpeI and NdeI. The resulting plasmid, named pPET1, contains the genepks15/1 in the same orientation as thepBlaF* promotor. Mycobacteria were separated from the culture media and both were kept. The media were sterilized by filtration through 0.2-μm pore size membrane and concentrated to one-tenth of the initial volumes. The cells were left in CHCl3/CH3OH 2:1, v/v, for 2 days at room temperature to kill bacteria, and lipids were extracted twice with CHCl3/CH3OH, 1:1, v/v, washed twice with water, and dried. Lipids from culture media were obtained by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 to 0.8 volume of concentrated culture medium to yield a homogenous one-phase mixture (34Bligh E. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). After a 2 h-period, the mixture was partitioned into two phases by the addition of 1 volume of H2O/CHCl3, 1:1, v/v. The organic phases were recovered, washed twice with water, and dried. The production of DIMs and glycolipids by the various strains was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Briefly, the various extracts were dissolved in CHCl3 to give a final lipid concentration of 20 mg/ml. Equivalent volumes of each extract were deposited on silica gel G 60 plates (20 × 20 cm, Merck), which were run in petroleum ether-diethylether (90:10, v/v) and CHCl3/CH3OH (95:5, v/v) for the detection of DIMs and PGLs, respectively. Glycolipids and DIMs were visualized by spaying the plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4 and H2SO4, respectively, following by heating. Glycolipids were purified as previously described (24Daffé M. Lacave C. Lanéelle M.-A. Lanéelle G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Crude lipid extracts from cells or culture medium were chromatographed on a Florisil (60–100 mesh) column and eluted with a series of concentrations of CH3OH (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 50, and 100%) in CHCl3. Each fraction was analyzed by TLC on silica gel G 60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) using CHCl3/CH3OH, 95:5, v/v as the solvent system. Glycolipids were visualized by spraying the plates with 0.2% anthrone (w/v) in concentrated H2SO4, followed by heating. When necessary, glycolipids were additionally purified by preparative chromatography on silica gel G 60 plates (0.3 mm, 20 × 20 cm, Merck) using CHCl3/CH3OH, 95:5, v/v as the developing solvent. Chemical shift obtained by NMR spectroscopy were assigned using two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear experiments at 500.13 MHz for proton and 125.76 MHz for carbon, using chloroform as reference both for protons (7.27 ppm) and for carbon (77.0 ppm). Spectra were recorded at 295 K on a Bruker DMX 500. The double quantum-filtered chemical-shift correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) experiment was performed using the Bruker standard pulse-field gradient program cosygpmf (35Ancian B. Bourgeois I. Dauphin J.-F. Shaw A.A. J. Magn. Res. 1997; 125: 348-354Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), with 0.41-s acquisition time, 4096 data points in the F2 dimension and 512 increments in the F1 dimension. The data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4096 × 4096 points, and a shifted sine-bell apodization function was applied prior to Fourier transformation. Similarly, nuclear Overhauseur spectroscopy (NOESY) (36Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2031) Google Scholar) was performed using the Bruker standard program nosesyst with a spin lock time of 200 ms. The heteronuclear Multiple Quantum Correlation (HMQC) and Multiple Bound Correlation (HMBC) were performed using the standard pulse-field gradient programs inv4gp and inv4gplrnd (37Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Res. 1983; 55: 301Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectrometry was performed using a voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems) equipped with a pulse nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm as previously described (38Laval F. Lanéelle M.-A. Deon C. Montsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in the Reflector mode using an extraction delay time set at 100 ns and an accelerating voltage operating in positive ion mode of 20 kV. The mass spectra were mass assigned by external calibration. Samples (1 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution in CHCl3) were directly applied onto the sample plate. The matrix solution (0.5 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid at 10 mg/ml in CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v)) was added. The samples were then allowed to crystallize at room temperature. Lipid samples were methanolized using CH3OH/HCl prepared by the acetyl chloride reaction on methanol in anhydrous conditions. Samples were dissolved in 500 μl of CH3OH/HCl (1 n) and incubated overnight at 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen and then co-evaporated three times with anhydrous CH3OH. For trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatization, samples were dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous pyridine, followed by the addition of 100 μl of hexamethyldisilazane and 50 μl of trimethylchlorosilane (39Sweeley C.C. Bentley R. Makita M. Wells W.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2497-2507Crossref Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was dried under nitrogen, and the TMS derivatives were solubilized in either diethylether, for gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), or in CHCl3 for MALDI-mass spectrometry. For transesterification, 200 μl of sodium ethanolate was added to dried samples (100 μg) under anhydrous conditions. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then stopped by adding acetic acid. The sample was dried, and lipids wer"
https://openalex.org/W2055765506,"We examined the ability of carbonic anhydrase II to bind to and affect the transport efficiency of the NHE1 isoform of the mammalian Na+/H+ exchanger. The C-terminal region of NHE1 was expressed in Escherichia coli fused with an N-terminal glutathionineS-transferase or with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Using a microtiter plate binding assay we showed that the C-terminal region of NHE1 binds carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and binding was stimulated by low pH and blocked by antibodies against the C-terminal of NHE1. The binding to NHE1 was confirmed by demonstrating protein-protein interaction using affinity blotting with CAII and immobilized NHE1 fusion proteins. CAII co-immunoprecipitated with NHE1 from CHO cells suggesting the proteins form a complex in vivo. In cells expressing CAII and NHE1, the H+ transport rate was almost 2-fold greater than in cells expressing NHE1 alone. The CAII inhibitor acetazolamide significantly decreased the H+ transport rate of NHE1 and transfection with a dominant negative CAII inhibited NHE1 activity. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal of NHE1 greatly increased the binding of CAII. Our study suggests that NHE1 transport efficiency is influenced by CAII, likely through a direct interaction at the C-terminal region. Regulation of NHE1 activity by phosphorylation could involve modulation of CAII binding.

Na+/H+ exchanger carbonic anhydrase II nitrilotriacetic acid minimum essential medium hemagglutinin radioimmune precipitation assay buffer Tris-buffered saline phosphate-buffered saline antibody dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) The Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE)1 is a ubiquitously expressed integral membrane glycoprotein that functions to exchange one intracellular proton for one extracellular sodium, thereby protecting cells from intracellular acidification (1Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several known isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger have been designated NHE1–NHE7. NHE1 was the first isoform cloned (2Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouysségur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and is ubiquitously expressed in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells, with the other isoforms having more restricted tissue distributions (3Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In mammals, NHE1 plays a key role in regulation of cell pH, cell volume, and cell proliferation (4Wiebe C.A. DiBattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is also critically involved in the damage that occurs to the myocardium with ischemia and reperfusion (5Avkiran M. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1 isoform) consists of two structural and functional domains, a 500 amino acid N-terminal membrane domain that is responsible for ion transport, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ∼300 amino acids that regulates activity of the membrane domain (1Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The large cytoplasmic domain is involved in protein-protein interactions with a number of proteins including calcineurin homologous protein (6Lin X. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 93: 12631-12636Google Scholar), calmodulin (7Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Iwamoto T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12854-12861Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and heat shock protein (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition the Na+/H+ exchanger is subject to regulation by phosphorylation that stimulates transport activity (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Carbonic anhydrases catalyze the hydration of CO2 to produce HCO3− and H+. The predominant cytoplasmic isozyme is carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) (10Sly W.S. Hu P.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 375-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). CAII deficiency is associated with osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and cerebral calcification (11Sly W.S. Whyte M.P. Sundaram V. Tashian R.E. Hewett-Emmett D. Guibaud P. Vainsel M. Baluarte H.J. Grushkin A., Al- Mosawi M. Sakati N. Ohlsson A. N. Eng. J. Med. 1985; 313: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the red blood cell, CA activity is required for efficient Cl−/HCO3− exchange by the anion exchanger AE1 (12Cousin J.L. Motais R. Sola F. J. Physiol. (London). 1975; 253: 385-399Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently it was discovered (13Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) that CAII binds directly to AE1. The binding site was located in acidic residues (887DADD) of the C-terminal cytosolic region of AE1 (14Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The binding site for AE1 was localized to the basic N-terminal of CAII (15Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Since the activity of CAII can result in proton production, an association of CAII with the Na+/H+ exchanger could facilitate proton removal. Several reports have supported the notion that the Na+/H+ exchanger is in some way associated with CA and AE. It was demonstrated earlier that the CA inhibitor acetazolamide could result in a reduction of Na+/H+ exchanger activity (16Wu Q. Pierce Jr., W.M. Delamere N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The Na+/H+ exchanger and the AE both localize to the same protruding lamellipodium regions of some cell types (17Klein M. Seeger S.B. Alper S.L. Schwab A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Also, the AE has long been shown to be linked to the cytoskeleton (18Davis L.H. Otto E. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11163-11169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Na+/H+ exchanger has also recently been shown to be linked to the cytoskeleton (19Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 8: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that the presence of NHE1 has been shown to be essential for the regulation or functional expression of HCO3−-dependent and -independent transporters in neurons (20Yao H., Ma, E., Gu, X.-Q. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that AE and CA interact with and may in some way be regulated by the Na+/H+ exchanger. In this report we examine the hypothesis that NHE1 binds to CAII. We demonstrate a direct interaction of CAII with the Na+/H+ exchanger and give evidence of effects on activity. The results support the hypothesis that Na+/H+ exchanger activity is linked to bicarbonate-based pH regulation possibly through carbonic anhydrase activity.

The C-terminal 182 amino acids of the rabbit Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) were expressed as a fusion protein with a C-terminal histidine tag (His182) using the plasmid pDest 17 and the GatewayTM Cloning System. TheE. coli strain BL21-SI strain was induced with 0.3m NaCl for 3 h. His182 protein was purified via Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). A Chinese hamster ovary cell line (AP1 cells) that was previously selected to lack endogenous NHE activity (22Rotin D. Steele-Norwood D. Grinstein S. Tannock I. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in α-MEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), pH 7.4 at 37 °C.

Singh D.N. Fliegel L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the plasmid pJRC36 encodes human CAII (24Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem.

Cells were grown on glass coverslips and the acetoxymethyl ester of BCECF-AM was used to measure pHi. Cells on the coverslips were incubated with BCECF-AM for 18 min at 37 °C and placed into a holder device and inserted into a fluorescence cuvette at room temperature. The cuvette was supplied with 5 mm HEPES buffer bubbled with 100% O2 (pH 7.4 ± 0.5) with a constant flow of 3.5 ml/min and shifted into a buffer containing 25 mm HCO3− to acidify cells for measurement of Na+/H+ exchanger activity has been used earlier (28Perez N.G.

They were treated with RIPA lysate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture) (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to extract cellular proteins. Total cell extracts were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose as described earlier (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-HA tag antibody (1:2000) and rabbit anti-human CAII antibody (1:50,000) were used to check for the expression of transfected proteins. To examine CAII binding to the Na+/H+ exchanger immobilized on nitrocellulose, GST, GST178, and His182 proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 10% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl) for 5 h at 4 °C. They were then incubated with 10 μg of CAII with 1% (w/v) skim milk powder in TBS and rocked gently overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBS for 4 × 15 min at room temperature. The nitrocellulose was then incubated with rabbit anti-CAII antibody (1:50,000) in TBS with 1% skim milk powder for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing for another hour with TBS. Further amplification was achieved by a subsequent incubation with goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibodies. Reactive bands were visualized by the Amersham Biosciences Enhanced Chemiluminescence system. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. AP1 cells, AP1/pYN4+, and AP1/pYN4+/pJRC36-transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and frozen in 2 ml of RIPA buffer in the absence of detergent (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 80 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and proteinase inhibitor mixture) by placing cells on dry ice. Cells were defrosted and removed from the flask followed by sonication for 15 s. The lysate was centrifuged (35,000 × g for 1 h), and the pellet containing the Na+/H+ exchanger was resuspended and sonicated for 15 s in 2 ml of RIPA buffer with detergent (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxychlolate). After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected for immunoprecipitation. The supernatant, containing Na+/H+ exchanger, was rocked overnight with 7.5 μl of rabbit anti-HA tag polyclonal antibody. Protein A-Sepharose was added, and the sample was incubated for a further 2 h. The resin was washed with RIPA buffer, and bound protein was solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-CAII antibody. For some experiments to obtain a more quantitative co-immunoprecipitation of CAII and the Na+/H+ exchanger a cross-linking reagent was used. DSP was added to cells at a final concentration of 2 mm for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by addition of Tris, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 mm. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the immunoprecipitation was continued as described above. Purified CAII (0.2 μg/well) was immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates by overnight incubation in buffer containing 1.25 mg/ml of 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethy) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate in 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0 at 4 °C. Plates were then washed extensively with PBST (150 mm NaCl, 5 mmsodium phosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) and blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The bound CAII was shown to be active by an esterase assay (13Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Plates were washed with PBST and incubated for 1 h with 0–100 nm GST178 or His182 in Ab buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% C12E8, 0.25% gelatin) at 37 °C. Purified GST was used as a control. Plates were washed with PBST and incubated with rabbit anti-GST (1:4000) antibody or with anti-His tag antibody (1:2000) for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were further washed, and goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase (1:4000) antibody was added for 1 h at 37 °C. Red color was developed by 0.1%o-phenylenediamine in substrate buffer (50 mmcitric acid, 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, 0.09% H2O2). The reaction was terminated with 50 μl of 3 m H2SO4 per well, and absorbance of microtiter plates was read atA 450. For some experiments the pH or incubation time of Ab buffer was varied as indicated in the figure legends. In other experiments an antibody against the C-terminal 178 amino acids of the Na+/H+ exchanger (described earlier, Ref.8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was premixed with His182 in the Ab buffer at the indicated concentrations. This was then immediately incubated with immobilized CAII. In some experiments cell extracts from rabbit ventricular muscle were used to phosphorylate the His182 fusion protein. Cell extracts and in vitrophosphorylation of the His182 fusion protein were as described earlier (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In some cases primary cultures of isolated myocyte cells were grown overnight in serum-free medium (unstimulated), as opposed to serum-containing medium (stimulated) to reduce the activity of NHE1-directed protein kinases as described earlier (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation (or mock phosphorylation of controls) by cell extracts the Na+/H+ exchanger fusion protein (His182) was removed from the cell extracts using Ni-NTA-linked agarose. Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated His182 proteins were used to examine CAII binding to the Na+/H+ exchanger immobilized on nitrocellulose as described above. To confirm that equal amounts of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated protein were present, nitrocellulose transfers were examined by Ponceau S staining. Somein vitro phosphorylation experiments contained32P to confirm in vitro phosphorylation of the protein. In these experiments the final ATP concentration was 250 μm. In experiments without 32P labeling the final ATP concentration was 1 mm. In some experiments we examined the binding of CAII to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated casein. To phosphorylate casein (4 μg) was treated with casein kinase 2 enzyme in a reaction consisting of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmEGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP (or 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP) and 1 μl of kinase (500 units/μl) for 30 min at 30 °C as described by others (30Landesman-Bollag E. Romieu-Mourez R. Song D.H. Sonenshein G.E. Cardiff R.D. Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3247-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Some in vitro phosphorylation experiments contained 32P to confirm in vitro phosphorylation of the protein. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated casein was then used to examine CAII binding while immobilized on nitrocellulose as described above for the Na+/H+ exchanger. To study the C-terminal region of the Na+/H+ exchanger it was produced as two independent fusion proteins. The fusion proteins contained amino acids 635–816 or 639–816, respectively, of the rabbit NHE1 protein with histidine and GST tags respectively. The identities of the induced proteins were confirmed using an antibody generated against the C-terminal region of Na+/H+ exchanger (not shown) (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified using the standard procedures with either glutathione-Sepharose or Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. A solid phase binding assay was used to examine the interaction between the C terminus of the Na+/H+ exchanger (GST178, His182) and CAII. CAII was immobilized on microtiter plates and possessed enzymatic activity indicating it had retained a native conformation (13Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The binding curves of GST178, His182 and GST to immobilized CAII (Fig.2 A) showed that the amount of GST178 and His182 binding increased with increasing concentrations and saturated at higher levels. Under the identical conditions, only a low background binding to GST was observed, suggesting the binding was caused by the Na+/H+ exchanger part of the molecules. There was no indication of cooperatively from the shape of the curve. We tested the effect of varying the pH of the incubation medium on the interaction between CAII and NHE1. The results (Fig.1 B) showed that in acidic medium the interaction between NHE1 and CAII was increased. A time course (Fig. 1 C) of the interaction between NHE1 and CAII showed that the association was time-dependent reaching saturation in 30 min. To confirm that the interaction was specifically due to the association between the C terminus of NHE1 and CAII we used an antibody generated against an independently made, different fusion protein of NHE1 directed toward the C-terminal 178 amino acids (8Silva N.L.C.L. Haworth R.S. Singh D. Fliegel L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10412-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 2 D) showed that this antibody blocked the association of CAII with NHE1.Figure 1Solid phase microtiter plate binding assay for Na+/H+ exchanger and CAII interactions. CAII was immobilized to microtiter plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fusion protein concentration was 20 nm (B–D).A, increasing concentrations of GST178, His182, or GST proteins were added to CAII immobilized to microtiter plates.

Results are mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the results of the solid phase assay we used an affinity blotting technique. Equal amounts (10 μg) of purified GST178, His182, or GST were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with CAII. The results (Fig. 2) showed that both the His-tagged and the GST-tagged Na+/H+ exchanger C-terminal proteins (GST178 and His182) bound CAII. Purified GST alone did not bind CAII. To determine if the Na+/H+ exchanger can interact with CAIIin vivo we made stable cell lines of AP1 cells expressing the Na+/H+ exchanger (pYN4+) alone or cells expressing the Na+/H+ exchanger plus CAII (pYN4+/pJRC36). Fig. 3 illustrates the analysis of the cell lines. Fig. 3 A demonstrates the presence of the Na+/H+ exchanger protein in cells lines transfected with HA-tagged Na+/H+exchanger protein. We usually found a larger form of the NHE1 protein of ∼105–110 kDa plus a smaller form about 90–95 kDa in size. This result is commonly found with the smaller isoform representing unglycosylated or partially glycosylated protein (26Wang H. Singh D. Fliegel L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Noel J. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3,B and C, demonstrate the presence of CAII and Na+/H+ exchanger, respectively, in cells stably co-transfected with pYN4+/pJRC36 plasmids. To examine if an interaction between CAII and the Na+/H+ exchanger occursin vivo, co-transfected actively growing cells were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Fig. 3 Dillustrates the results of immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates.Lanes 1 and 2 contained CAII immunoreactive protein of the same size as purified CAII protein (lane 4).Lane 3 contained immunoprecipitates of untransfected AP1 cells and did not show any CAII immunoreactive species. The results show that a complex of CAII and NHE1 can be isolated from co-transfected cells. In this experiment we did not use a cross-linker to secure the CAII to the Na+/H+ exchanger, and therefore the results could be described qualitatively only. To determine if CAII binding influences the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger we examined pH regulation in AP1, AP1/pYN4+, and AP1/pYN4+/pJRC36 cells. Fig.4 A illustrates examples of the effects obtained during transient induction of acid load by shifting cells from 02-gassed nominally CO2-free medium to CO2/HCO3−-containing medium as described by others (27Tang X.-B. Kovacs M. Sterling D. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3557-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Perez N.G. Alvarez B.V. Camilion de Hurtado M.C. Cingolani H.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Murray G.M.M.J. Trumble W. Magnuson B.A. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 1036-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). AP1 cells, lacking the Na+/H+ exchanger, showed only very small amounts of alkalization (recovery) after acid load. Stably transfected AP1/pYN4+ cells showed a much greater recovery (Fig. 4 A), indicating that the Na+/H+ exchanger extruded H+s and alkalinized the cells. The results shown were typical of several independently made cell lines. Stable transfectants of AP1/pYN4+/pJRC36 cells also alkalinized after acid load; however, their recovery was faster than AP1/pYN4+ cells, indicating that cotransfection of CAII with NHE1 stimulated H+ transport by the Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 4 A). This effect was reduced by treatment with acetazolamide. Fig. 4 Bsummarizes these results. The amiloride analogue 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)-amiloride inhibited the recovery indicating that it was due to the Na+/H+exchanger (not shown). Fig. 4 B also shows that treatment with the CA inhibitor acetazolamide can affect Na+/H+ exchanger activity of (AP1/pYN4+). The H+ transport rate of AP1/NHE1 cells was reduced 37 ± 7.8% (n = 5) when cells were treated with 100 μm acetazolamide (Fig. 4 B). Acetazolamide also reduced the transport rate of AP1/NHE1/CAII cells by 74% (n = 5). To confirm that a direct interaction between CAII and NHE1 was necessary for stimulation of NHE1 activity, we transiently transfected the dominant negative CAII mutant with a V143Y mutation into AP1/pYN4+ cells. We found that this resulted in approximately a 50% decrease in NHE1 activity (Fig. 4 C,n = 4) likely due to displacement of endogenous CAII from its binding site on NHE1. Transfection with equivalent amount of vector without CAII had no effect on NHE1 activity (not shown). Because phosphorylation of NHE1 has been shown to be stimulatory to activity (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) we examined if phosphorylation could influence the binding of CAII to the C-terminal of NHE1. Fig.5 A (lane 1) confirms that cell extracts from rabbit ventricles phosphorylate the His182 fusion protein. As a control, we also phosphorylated commercially obtained casein, using casein kinase II (lane 3). We then examined the effect of phosphorylation of CAII binding. Fig. 5 B compares the binding of CAII to equal amounts of phosphorylated (lane 1) and non-phosphorylated (lane 2) His182 protein and phosphorylated (lane 3) and non-phosphorylated (lane 4) casein. Phosphorylated NHE1 C-terminal protein bound much larger amounts of CAII than unphosphorylated protein. The effect was seen in over seven independent experiments with the His182 protein. Phosphorylation of the NHE1 protein also caused a slight mobility shift in the protein typical of proteins with added phosphate moieties. Neither phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated casein bound CAII. To compare the effect of different amounts of phosphorylation activity from cells we examined the effects of isolated myocyte extracts treated or untreated with serum as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 5 C shows that unstimulated extracts phosphorylated the His182 protein to a lesser degree than stimulated extracts. The same extracts were used to treat the His182 protein and then the binding of CAII was examined. The results are shown in Fig.5 D. Extracts from active, stimulated cells that caused a higher degree of phosphorylation (lanes 2 and4, stimulated), resulted in greater binding of the CAII protein to His182 than cells that caused a lesser degree of phosphorylation (lanes 1 and 3). The amount of increase in CAII binding by increased levels of phosphorylation was between 45 and 60% in three different experiments. To examine the effect of phosphorylation in vivo on the binding of CAII to the Na+/H+ exchanger we used a cross-linking reagent, DSP, to make the linkage between the two proteins more stable and more quantitative during the immunoprecipitation process. DSP contains a thiol-cleavable linkage, and the samples were incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β -mercaptoethanol prior to electrophoresis. The results are shown in Fig. 5 E. Lanes 2 and 3 illustrate immunoprecipitated CAII from cells transfected with Na+/H+ exchanger and CAII. The amount immunopreciptated from cells in the presence of serum (lane 2) was always greater than that in the absence of serum (lane 3). Lanes 4 and 5illustrate a similar experiment but with cells transfected with only the Na+/H+ exchanger. More CAII immunoprecipited in the presence of serum (lane 4) than in its absence (lane 5). In addition the amount of CAII immunoprecipitated in these cells in the presence of serum (lane 4) was reduced by about 40%, compared with cells transfected with additional CAII (lane 2). In the absence of serum there was no difference in the amount immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with or without exogenous CAII, and this amount was always small, about 25–35% of the amount of CAII immunoprecipitated from serum-stimulated cells. Reprobing the immunoblot with anti-HA antibody demonstrated that the equivalent amount of Na+/H+ exchanger was present in lanes 2–5 (not shown). The Na+/H+ exchanger is an essential part of pH homeostasis in mammalian cells. Regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger has been the subject of many investigations but is still not well understood at the molecular level. The C-terminal, hydrophilic domain of Na+/H+exchanger regulates the activity of the membrane domain that transports the Na+ and H+ ions (4Wiebe C.A. DiBattista E.R. Fliegel L. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Fliegel L. J. Thromb. Thrombolysis. 1999; 8: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic, C-terminal of the exchanger is over 300 amino acids in length and can be divided into four distinct subdomains that are involved in regulation. These include an ATP-dependent regulation, phosphorylation region, and binding regions for calcineurin homologous protein and calmodulin (1Fliegel L. Basic Res. Cardiol. 2001; 96: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is still unclear if there are other proteins involved in the interactions of the C-terminal of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Recently, it was found that CAII could interact with the C-terminal of the anion exchanger by binding with an acidic amino acid cluster (887DADD) (13Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 14Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Removal of the DADD sequence resulted in a loss of CAII binding (14Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The binding may allow the formation of a metabolon between AEI and CAII that functions to channel the products of the carbonic anhydrase reaction to the anion exchanger (25Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A.F. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47886-47894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 33Reithmeier RA. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several observations suggested that CAII might also associate with the Na+/H+ exchanger. First, there is a general structural and functional similarity between the anion exchanger and Na+/H+ exchanger, with both proteins having large interior cytoplasmic domains with internal acidic amino acids. Second, several reports have suggested that the Na+/H+ exchanger is associated with CA and AEs (16Wu Q. Pierce Jr., W.M. Delamere N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Yao H., Ma, E., Gu, X.-Q. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Mason M.J. Smith J.D. Garcia-Soto J.J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C428-C433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, since CA catalyzes the hydration of CO2 to produce a proton and bicarbonate, it might also co-localize with NHE1 to improve efficiency of proton removal, similar to CAII and the AE. It is of note that the C-terminal 178 amino acids of NHE1 contain 12 aspartate and 17 glutamate residues that could be involved in forming a binding site for CAII. Our study demonstrated that the C-terminal 178 amino acids of NHE1 can bind CAII in microtiter plate binding assays and in affinity blotting assays with immobilized Na+/H+exchanger (Figs. 1 and 2). It was clear that the Na+/H+ exchanger part of these fusion proteins was responsible for the binding since GST alone did not bind to CAII. CAII was found co-imunoprecipitating with the Na+/H+ exchanger from cells either transfected or not transfected with CAII (Fig. 3 D). However the AP1 cells we used in this study possessed endogenous CAII (Fig.3 B, lane 1). Overall our results clearly indicate an interaction between CAII and the Na+/H+exchanger both in vivo and in vitro. To examine the effects of CAII binding on Na+/H+ exchanger activity in vivo, pH regulation of transfected cells was measured. Our results showed that cells transfected with both Na+/H+exchanger and CAII have a higher H+ transport rate compared with cells transfected with Na+/H+ exchanger alone. The H+ transport rate in cotransfected cells increased 76%, which suggests that CAII could stimulate Na+/H+ exchanger activity. In addition, the CAII inhibitor acetazolamide significantly decreased the H+transport rates by the Na+/H+ exchanger. This result further demonstrated that CAII activity influences activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger. It was notable that transfection with a dominant negative inactive carbonic anhydrase mutant resulted in a decrease in activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger protein (Fig. 4 C). Overexpression of a dominant negative CAII would cause displacement of endogenous CAII from its binding site on NHE1 by the inactive CAII mutant. Therefore we interpret the inhibitory effect of V143Y CAII on the Na+/H+ exchanger activity as an indication that direct binding by an active CAII protein is necessary for stimulatory activity. Phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger has been shown to stimulate activity in the heart and other tissues. Phosphorylation has also been localized to the C-terminal 178 amino acids of the protein (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) similar to the region that we found binds CAII. We found that phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger greatly increased CAII binding (Fig. 5). The effect was specific to CAII since phosphorylation of casein did not result in CAII binding. The effect of phosphorylation occurred in vitro, and we also found that serum treatment of cells increases the amount of CAII that co-immunoprecipitated with the Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 5 E). We have earlier shown that such serum stimulation causes phosphorylation of the Na+/H+ exchanger in vivo (9Moor A.N. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22985-22992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation has been shown to stimulate the activity of the Na+/H+ exchanger, and since we found that expression of CAII protein stimulated Na+/H+exchanger activity, this leaves open the possibility that the mechanism by which phosphorylation stimulates the activity is through increased CAII binding. However at present, this only remains a theory and further experiments are necessary to explore this possibility. It is interesting to note that the pH dependence of interaction of CAII with the Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 1 B) is consistent with the known activity profile of NHE1, which is activated by decreases in intracellular pH. In summary, our results show that CAII can bind to the C-terminal of the Na+/H+ exchanger in vitro andin vivo. The interaction can influence pH regulation of Na+/H+ exchanger in mammalian cells. Where CAII binds on the C-terminal of Na+/H+ exchanger and how CAII interacts with Na+/H+ exchanger remains undefined. Further experiments are necessary to define the binding site of CAII. Our results support the earlier suggestions that CAII, the AE, and Na+/H+ exchanger activity may be linked together in a functional complex or metabolon involved in intracellular bicarbonate and pH regulation (20Yao H., Ma, E., Gu, X.-Q. Haddad G.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Mason M.J. Smith J.D. Garcia-Soto J.J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C428-C433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Future experiments will further explore this possibility and the regulatory role that phosphorylation plays in protein-protein interactions that modulate Na+/H+ exchanger activity. We thank B.

We found that Dyrk1 can substantially enhance Gli1-dependent, but not LEF-1-, c-Jun-, or Elk-dependent, gene transcription. In part, Dyrk1 does this through retaining Gli1 in the nucleus. However, we also demonstrate that Dyrk1 can enhance the transcriptional activity of Gli1-AHA, a nuclear export mutant, suggesting that Dyrk1 may be more directly involved in regulating the transcriptional activity of Gli1. In addition, Dyrk1 acted synergistically with Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to induce gene transcription and differentiation in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells. The failure of Shh to stimulate Dyrk1 kinase activity suggests that Dyrk1 may not be directly regulated by the Shh signaling pathway but functionally interacts with it. Thus, Gli1 transcriptional activity may be subjected to further regulation in the cell nucleus by a pathway distinct from Shh signaling, one mediated by Dyrk1.

Thus, Gli1 transcriptional activity may be subjected to further regulation in the cell nucleus by a pathway distinct from Shh signaling, one mediated by Dyrk1. The dual specificity Yak1-related kinase (Dyrk) 1The abbreviations used are: Dyrk, dual specificity Yak1-related kinase; Shh, Sonic hedgehog; NES, nuclear export sequence; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; Luc, luciferase; Hh, hedgehog. 1The abbreviations used are: Dyrk, dual specificity Yak1-related kinase; Shh, Sonic hedgehog; NES, nuclear export sequence; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; LEF, lymphoid enhancer factor; Luc, luciferase; Hh, hedgehog. gene family encodes for dual specificity kinases that can phosphorylate serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (1Kentrup H.

Dyrks are distant members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and also share sequence similarity to cyclin-dependent kinases (3Miyata Y. Nishida E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Dyrk family in mammals consists of at least seven members, with four distinct classes of Dyrk kinases (Dyrk1–4) (2Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, an increasing number of Dyrk-like kinases also have been reported, including the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase family, androgen receptor protein kinase, and Myak (4Kim Y.H.

Although the developmental importance of the Dyrk gene family remains largely unknown, studies with Yak1 in yeast and minibrain(mnb) in Drosophila suggest their involvement in regulating cell proliferation (7Hartley A.D. Ward M.P. Garrett S. Genetics. 1994; 136: 465-474PubMed Google Scholar, 8Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As the name suggests,mnb mutant flies have a smaller brain size as a result of a defect in neurogenesis (8Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). There is evidence in humans that the Dyrk1 class, a homolog of the Drosophila mnb gene, contains three separate genes, Dyrk1a, Dyrk1b, and Dyrk1c (9Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dyrk1a has been mapped to the Down's syndrome critical region of chromosome 21, and transgenic mice harboring an extra copy of this gene retain deficits in learning (10Song W.J. Sternberg L.R. Kasten-Sportes C. Keuren M.L. Chung S.H. Slack A.C. Miller D.E. Glover T.W. Chiang P.W. Lou L. Kurnit D.M.

Genet. 2001; 10: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the Dyrk1/mnb class has evolved a conserved role that is essential for proper brain development. Cell transfection studies on GFP-tagged versions of Dyrk1a and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 have confirmed their nuclear localization (2Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 4Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Lee S.J. Conti M.A. Kim Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25875-25879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the staining pattern of GFP fluorescence in the nucleus has revealed that Dyrk1a and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 associate with nuclear speckles, potential sites of alternative splicing or transcriptional regulation. Recently, studies with homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 have demonstrated its ability to associate with nuclear bodies, co-localize with PML3, and bind p53 and CREB-binding protein, revealing its role in transcriptional regulation (13D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Consistent with the idea that nuclear localized Dyrks may regulate transcriptional activity, many of the protein substrates identified in protein interactor screens involving Dyrk have been transcription factors. Biochemical studies with Dyrk1a have demonstrated its ability to interact with the transcription factors Forkhead, CREB, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (15Woods Y.L. Rena G.

Methods. 2001; 247: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell transfection studies carried out in our laboratory have revealed that Dyrk1a can dramatically enhance the transcriptional activity of Gli1. Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 are vertebrate homologs to theDrosophila cubitus interruptus (ci) gene, a five-zinc finger transcription factor whose function is highly regulated by the hedgehog signaling pathway (18Von Ohlen T. Hooper J.E. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 19Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H.

Hedgehog genes encode for secreted signaling proteins that can function as growth factor and morphogen important for cell proliferation and pattern formation (21Hammerschmidt M. Brook A. McMahon A.P. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 22Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P.

Analagous to Ci in Drosophila, Gli transcription factors are key downstream signaling components of the hedgehog pathway in vertebrates. Increasing evidence suggests that Gli/Ci proteins are highly regulated in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. In the absence of hedgehog signaling, Ci protein is retained in the cell cytoplasm as part of a protein complex associated with microtubules containing the negative regulators Costal2 and suppressor of fused (SuF) (24Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S., Ye, W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4437-4448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pearse II, R.V.

Here full-length Ci protein is proteolytically processed into a shortened transcriptional repressor form (28Muller B. Basler K. Development. 2000; 127: 2999-3007PubMed Google Scholar, 29Price M.A. Kalderon D. Cell. 2002; 108: 823-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the presence of hedgehog signaling, full-length Ci protein is transported into the nucleus to activate hedgehog target genes (30Wang Q.T. Holmgren R.A. Development. 2000; 127: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once inside the nucleus, Gli transcription factor activity is still modulated by a number of different factors. CREB-binding protein, a general transcriptional co-activator, can directly bind Ci or Gli3 and is believed to enhance transcription in part through its acetylase activity (31Akimaru H. Chen Y. Dai P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical data also suggest that SuF may associate with SAP18 and mSin3, forming a deacetlyase complex, resulting in Gli/Ci transcriptional repression (34Cheng S.Y. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5442-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe our findings that Dyrk1 activated Gli1-dependent gene transcription, but not LEF-1-, c-jun-, or Elk-dependent gene transcription. Dyrk1 does this by retaining Gli1 in the nucleus as well as by enhancing the transcriptional activity. In addition, we show that Dyrk1 functionally interacts with the Shh pathway to induce gene transcription and differentiation in C3H10T1/2 cells. NIH3T3 cells and Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in minimum essential medium α medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The transfection was stopped after 3 h, and cell extracts were collected 24 h later for luciferase assays, kinase assays, and Western analysis. Luciferase assays were performed using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals Luciferase Assay Kit as instructed. Cell lysates were first taken to determine the fluorescence intensity emitted by GFP in a Wallac multicounter, which is capable of counting fluorescence and luminescence. Then, luciferase substrate was added to the cell lysates, and luciferase activities were determined by measuring luminescence intensity using the same counter. Luminescence intensity was normalized against fluorescence intensity. DNA concentrations were adjusted if transfection of any of the cDNAs resulted in significant differences between normalized and non-normalized data. Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis were performed as described previously (35Mao J. Xie W. Yuan H. Simon M.I. Mano H. Wu D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5638-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For in vitro Dyrk kinase assay, Gli1-HA or its mutants and Dyrk1-HA were separately expressed in Cos-7 cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies. 24 h later, cells were lysed, and HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody. The immunocomplexes were mixed and then divided into two portions. One portion was washed, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody, and the other was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 μCi of [32P]ATP and 10 μm ATP. The kinase reactions were terminated by the addition of 4× SDS sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using a phosphorimager. NIH3T3 cells transfected with appropriate expression plasmids were fixed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100. HA-tagged Dyrk1 or Dyrk1KR was detected by immunofluorescence staining using a red fluorescent Alexis dye-conjugated anti-HA antibody, whereas the intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was directly visualized under a fluorescence microscope simultaneously. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. C3H10T1/2 cells were lysed 3 days after transfection. The cell lysates were mixed with the CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate for alkaline phosphatase as instructed by the manufacturer (Tropix). After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the luminescence intensity was measured using the Wallac multicounter. To investigate the possible involvement of Dyrk1 in gene transcriptional regulation, we examined the effects of Dyrk1 overexpression in a number of reporter gene assay systems. We found that co-expression of Dyrk1 and Gli1 strongly induced Gli1-dependent gene transcription in the presence of the 3′GliBS-Luc reporter construct, but not in the presence of the mutant reporter construct, m3′GliBS-Luc (Fig.1 A). The 3′GliBS-Luc reporter construct, as described previously (19Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains Gli DNA binding sequences through which the production of the reporter, luciferase, is regulated. In addition, we found that Dyrk1 enhanced the binding of Gli1 to its response element in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). The involvement of Dyrk1 in gene transcriptional regulation of Gli1 appears to be specific because expression of Dyrk1 did not activate Elk-, c-Jun-, or LEF-1-mediated gene transcription in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1, B−D). In addition, many other protein kinases, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, Src, and casein kinase Iε, while stimulating Elk-, c-Jun-, and LEF-1-dependent gene transcription, respectively, failed to induce Gli1-dependent gene transcription (Fig. 1 A). The Dyrk1 Drosophila homolog mnb, which shares 85% amino acid sequence homology with Dyrk1 in its kinase domain (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 8Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), was also tested, and it was found to be a potent activator of Gli1 (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether activation of Gli1-dependent gene transcription by Dyrk1 depends on its kinase activity, we obtained a kinase-null mutant, Dyrk1KR, which contains a Lys-188 to Arg point mutation at the ATP binding region of its kinase domain. Unlike wild-type Dyrk1, this kinase-deficient mutant did not show any synergistic effect with Gli1 (Fig.2 A). In addition, activation of Gli1-mediated gene transcription seems to be independent of Dyrk1 C-terminal sequences because deletion of C-terminal residues 498–763 located after the kinase domain did not affect its capacity to induce Gli1-dependent gene transcription (data not shown). Regulation of Ci proteolysis has been proposed as a mechanism for regulation of its transcriptional activity (36Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Because there are no significant changes in the levels of full-length Gli1 protein when Gli1 and Dyrk1 were co-expressed (Fig. 2 B), the processing of Gli1 protein may not play an important role in Dyrk1-mediated Gli1 activation. In the past several years, it has been reported that regulation of nuclear trafficking represents a novel mechanism for the control of the activities of gene transcriptional regulators (37Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Two recent studies (38Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B., Ma, Y. Beachy P.A.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) as well as our data (see below) demonstrate that Gli1 and Ci are nuclear shuttling proteins. Hedgehog signaling appears to regulate the import of Ci (38Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B., Ma, Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In addition, vertebrate Su(fu), a homolog of the Drosophila hegdgehog signaling protein suppressor of fused, binds to Gli proteins (25Pearse II, R.V. Collier L.S. Scott M.P. Tabin C.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 39Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and may retard Gli1 nuclear import (39Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 42Ding Q. Fukami S. Meng X. Nishizaki Y. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Dlugosz A. Nakafuku M. Hui C.-C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 9: 1119-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We investigated whether Dyrk1, which is localized in the nucleus (2Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), has any effect on the subcellular localization of Gli1. To determine the intracellular localization of Gli1, we constructed the expression plasmid Gli1-GFP. The intracellular localization of Gli1-GFP fusion protein was visualized under fluorescence in the presence or absence of Dyrk1-HA. Dyrk1-HA and nuclei were visualized after Gli1-GFP in the same cell and stained with red fluorescent Alexis dye-conjugated anti-HA antibody and Hoechst dye, respectively. Consistent with previous reports (9Becker W. Weber Y. Wetzel K. Eirmbter K. Tejedor F.J. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25893-25902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 39Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), Dyrk1 and its mutant, Dyrk1KR, were primarily localized in the nucleus (Fig.3, E and H), whereas the Gli1 protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in the absence of co-expressed Dyrk1 (Fig. 3 A). However, co-expression of Dyrk1-HA caused significant accumulation of Gli1-GFP in the nucleus (Fig. 3 D). More importantly, Dyrk1-mediated nuclear accumulation of Gli1-GFP protein depended on Dyrk1 kinase activity because Dyrk1KR could not induce nuclear accumulation of Gli1 protein (Fig. 3 G). The levels of Gli1 in the nuclear fraction from cells expressing Dyrk1 were also found to be higher than those from cells expressing control protein β-galactosidase (data not shown). Phosphorylation has recently emerged as a major mechanism for regulating protein nuclear transport (37Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because Dyrk1 kinase activity is essential for Gli1 nuclear retention, we wanted to know whether Dyrk1 could phosphorylate Gli1 protein, and which domains might be phosphorylated. Gli1-HA or its truncated mutants (Fig. 4 A) and Dyrk1-HA were separately expressed in Cos-7 cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibodies. Then the immunocomplexes were mixed in the presence of [32P]ATP. Significant phosphorylation of Gli1-HA, Gli1N-HA, and Gli1C-HA, but not Gli1ZF-HA, was observed in the presence of Dyrk1 (Fig. 4 B). No phosphorylation was detected in the absence of Dyrk1 (Fig.4 B) or in the presence of Dyrk1KR (data not shown). Although Dyrk1 is a dual specificity kinase, the phosphorylation of Gli1 by Dyrk1 appeared to be predominantly on Ser/Thr residues because we could not detect phosphotyrosines in Dyrk1-treated Gli1 or its mutants by Western analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (data not shown). However, we were able to detect Dyrk1 autophosphorylation by using the same anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 2 C). A previous report has demonstrated that tyrosine autophosphorylation of Dyrk1 is required for its kinase activity (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). These results, together with the observation that Dyrk1-mediated nuclear accumulation of Gli1 depends on its kinase activity, suggest that Dyrk1 may regulate nuclear transport of Gli proteins via phosphorylation. Dyrk1 phosphorylates both the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of Gli1. To determine which portions of Gli1 are required for Dyrk1-mediated nuclear retention, two Gli1 mutants, Gli1ΔN-GFP (amino acids 195–1107) and Gli1ΔC-GFP (amino acids 1–410), were generated, and the intracellular localization was determined in the presence or absence of co-expressed Dyrk1. We found that both Gli1ΔN-GFP and Gli1ΔC-GFP were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm despite the presence of Dyrk1. However, we noticed that Gli1ΔC-GFP was detected in the nuclei of a small fraction of cells that co-express both Gli1ΔC-GFP and Dyrk1 (data not shown). Nevertheless, we believe that both the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of Gli1 are important for efficient nuclear retention of Gli1 by Dyrk1. With the knowledge that Dyrk1 phosphorylates and retains Gli1 protein in the nucleus, the next question is whether nuclear retention of Gli1 is the sole mechanism for Dyrk1-induced Gli-dependent transcriptional activation. To address this question, we generated another Gli1 mutant, called Gli1-AHA-GFP, in which three amino acids (Leu-Arg-Leu) in the core tetramer of the nuclear export sequence (NES) were changed to Ala-His-Ala (Fig.5 A). As we expected, this mutant accumulated in the nucleus independently of Dyrk1 (Fig.5 B). This result further confirmed that Gli1 NES is involved in Gli1 export, probably by interacting with the nuclear export receptor Crm1 (46Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of Gli1-AHA was determined using the 3′GliBS-Luc reporter assay. We found that Gli1-AHA showed a higher basal transcriptional activity than the wild-type Gli1 (Fig. 5 C). This augmented basal activity is probably due to the increased accumulation of Gli mutant proteins in the nucleus. The fact that basal activity of Gli1-AHA is less than the activity of the wild-type Gli1 in the presence of Dyrk1 and that Gli1-AHA can be further stimulated by co-expressed Dyrk1 suggests that Dyrk1 can also stimulate the transcriptional activity of Gli1 in addition to retaining Gli1 in the nucleus. The expression levels of wild-type Dyrk1 and its AHA mutant are shown in Fig. 5 D. In the presence of hedgehog signaling, increased levels of Gli/Ci proteins get imported into the nucleus and activate downstream target genes (36Ingham P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3505-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar,47Altaba A.R.I. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to know whether Dyrk1 could potentiate a Gli response in cells undergoing Shh signaling. It was previously shown that Shh could induce Gli-dependent transcriptional activation of the 3′GliBS-Luc reporter gene and differentiation in C3H10T1/2 embryonic fibroblast cells (48Murone M. Rosenthal A. de Sauvage F.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 76-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, when C3H10T1/2 cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding Shh and 3′GliBS-Luc reporter gene, the cells produced more luciferase activity than cells transfected with 3′GliBS-Luc reporter gene alone (Fig. 6 A). Co-expression of Dyrk1 with Shh further increases reporter gene activity, which is more than the sum of those in cells expressing Dyrk1 or Shh alone, suggesting that Shh and Dyrk1 acted synergistically. The effect of Dyrk1 on Shh-induced differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells was also examined by assaying changes in alkaline phosphatase activity as described previously (48Murone M. Rosenthal A. de Sauvage F.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 76-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 49Kinto N. Iwamoto M. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Noji S. Ohuchi H. Yoshioka H. Kataoka H. Wada Y. Yuhao G. Takahashi H.E. Yoshiki S. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Again, co-expression of Dyrk1 with Shh demonstrated a synergistic effect, this time in stimulating alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether the Shh-activated pathway directly regulates Dyrk1, we examined whether Shh could stimulate Dyrk1 phosphorylation. Dyrk1 was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Dyrk1 alone or from cells co-expressing Dyrk and Shh. The phosphotyrosine content of precipitated Dyrk was detected using a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody. Shh did not stimulate phosphorylation of Dyrk (Fig.6 D). In agreement with this, the Dyrk kinase-deficient mutant did not inhibit Shh-induced production of alkaline phosphatase in C3H10T1/2 cells (Fig. 6 C). Thus, Dyrk does not appear to be directly regulated by Shh. In this study, we provide biochemical evidence that Dyrk1, a nuclear protein kinase, and its Drosophila homologmnb can enhance the transcriptional activity of Gli1. In part, this increase in transcriptional activity is a result of elevated Gli1 protein levels in the nucleus. However, the ability of Dyrk1 to induce transcriptional activity of Gli1-AHA, a nuclear export mutant, also suggests that Dyrk1 may be more directly involved in modulating Gli1 transcriptional activity. We also show that Gli1 is phosphorylated in the presence of Dyrk1 and that Dyrk1 kinase activity is essential for Gli1 nuclear retention and its increased transcriptional activity. In addition, Dyrk1 can synergistically function with Shh to stimulate Gli reporter gene activity and differentiate C3H10T1/2 cells. Nuclear cytoplasmic trafficking has been shown to be one mechanism by which transcription factor function can be modulated (37Hood J.K. Silver P.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Previous work on Gli/Ci, as well as our work presented here, has demonstrated that Gli/Ci proteins are nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling proteins. The nuclear export of Gli1/Ci appears to depend on Crm1, a nuclear export receptor, because the typical NES sequences are required for export (Fig. 5 A) and can be blocked by leptomycin B (39Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Chen et al. (38Chen C.H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B., Ma, Y. Beachy P.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) showed that regulation of nuclear-cytoplasmic transport might be one mechanism used by Hh to regulate Ci. Hh may not only prevent Ci from proteolytic cleavage but may also increase levels of Ci in the nucleus by promoting its nuclear import. Phosphorylation has been shown to have different effects on the interactions between shuttling proteins and Crm1. Phosphorylation of MK2 at a specific site was shown to unmask the NES, thus facilitating binding to Crm1 and stimulating its nuclear export (50Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation at serine residues in the NES of cyclin B blocked binding to Crm1 and inhibited its nuclear export (45Yang J. Bardes E.S. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M.A. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that overexpression of Dyrk1, a nuclear localized kinase, led to the accumulation of Gli1 in the nucleus. We also showed that Dyrk1 kinase activity is necessary for Gli1 nuclear retention and that Gli1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in the presence of Dyrk1 (Fig. 4). Therefore, one potential mechanism by which Dyrk1 can regulate Gli1 function is by regulating its nuclear export through phosphorylation. However, the accumulation of Gli1 in the nucleus as a result of Dyrk1 kinase activity could also be from an increase in protein-protein interactions. In support of this idea, recent work has shown that co-expression of Zic proteins, nuclear localized transcription factors, with members of the Gli family also results in accumulation of Gli proteins in the nucleus (44Koyabu Y. Nakata K. Mizugishi K. Aruga J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6889-6892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate that Dyrk1 kinase activity does more than retain Gli1 in the nucleus–it also stimulates Gli1 transcriptional activity. Reporter gene studies in which Dyrk1 and Gli1-AHA were co-expressed clearly show that Gli1 transcriptional activity can be further enhanced by Dyrk1. This suggests that Dyrk1 may be more directly involved in modulating the transcriptional activity of Gli1 in the nucleus. Therefore, it is possible that Dyrk1 phosphorylation of Gli1 results in more efficient association of Gli1 with other transcriptional cofactors, thus delaying its nuclear export. Consistent with our observation that Dyrk1 can stimulate Gli1 transcriptional activity, previous work on Dyrk1 has suggested that it may also regulate the function of other transcription factors such as CREB, Forkhead, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (15Woods Y.L.

Methods. 2001; 247: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2, a Dyrk-like kinase, can bind p53 and CREB-binding protein to enhance transcription (13D'Orazi G. Cecchinelli B. Bruno T. Manni I. Higashimoto Y. Saito S. Gostissa M. Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies provide increasing evidence that one possible role of nuclear localized Dyrk kinases may be to modulate transcription factor function. However, how specific or general a role remains to be determined. The distinct effect of Hh and Dyrk on the nuclear transport of the Ci/Gli proteins suggests that Dyrk1 may not be a direct signaling component within the Hh pathway. This is consistent with our observations that Shh did not stimulate phosphorylation of Dyrk1 and that the kinase-deficient mutant of Dyrk1 could not inhibit Shh-induced effects in C3H10T1/2 cells. However, the synergistic effect between Dyrk1 and Shh in enhancing Gli-dependent gene transcription and increasing alkaline phosphatase activity in C3H10T1/2 cells suggests that these two pathways may functionally interact. Although Dyrk1 is not essential for Hh signaling, levels of Dyrk1 kinase activity in the nucleus may determine how robust cells respond to Hh signaling. Thus, Gli/Ci proteins may be the cellular targets for at least two distinct signaling pathways: one regulated by the Hh proteins in the cytoplasm, and the other mediated by the Dyrk kinases in the nucleus. The inability of Shh to stimulate Dyrk1 phosphorylation still leaves the following question: what regulates Dyrk kinase activity? Similar to mitogen-activated protein kinases, Dyrks contain an activation loop within the catalytic domain (2Becker W. Joost H.G. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, early studies hypothesized that Dyrk activation may be analogous to mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, via phosphorylation by an upstream kinase (1Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurmann A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3488-3495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, recent transfection studies in mammalian cells favor the possibility that, unlike mitogen-activated protein kinases, Dyrk1 can activate itself through auto-phosphorylation (43Himpel S. Panzer P. Eirmbter K. Czajkowska H. Sayed M. Packman L.C. Blundell T. Kentrup H. Grotzinger J. Joost H.G. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This may explain why overexpression of Dyrk1 alone results in vigorous kinase activity. It is also interesting to speculate that if Dyrk1a can activate itself through autophosphorylation, then gene dosage and transcriptional control may be important regulatory mechanisms. Another possibility is that Dyrk, like glycogen synthase kinase 3, might be negatively regulated by yet unknown upstream kinases or even phosphatases. Developmental studies of the Dyrk1/mnb class of Dyrk kinases suggest an important role in proper brain development. Mutations in theDrosophila mnb gene that cause a reduction protein expression were associated with defects in neuroblast proliferation and specific behavioral abnormalities (8Tejedor F. Zhu X.R. Kaltenbach E. Ackermann A. Baumann A. Canal I. Heisenberg M. Fischbach K.F. Pongs O. Neuron. 1995; 14: 287-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The mammalian homolog of mnb, Dyrk1a, has been mapped to the Down's syndrome critical region of chromosome 21, and transgenic mice retaining an extra copy of Dyrk1 have learning deficits (10Song W.J.

Several studies have also demonstrated the involvement of the Hh-Gli signaling pathway in neuronal proliferation (47Altaba A.R.I. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate central nervous system, Shh acts as a mitogen for a number of neuronal precursor cells, including those located in the spinal cord and retina, oligodendrocyte cell precursors in the neural tube, and granule neuronal cell precursors in the cerebellum (40Rowitch D.H., St.- Jacques B. Lee S. Flax J.D. Snyder E.Y. McMahon A.P. Development. 1999; 19: 8954-8965Google Scholar, 41Wechsler-Reya R.J. Scott M.P.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Studies on the hedgehog receptor Patched1 also reveal the importance of repressing the Hh pathway during brain development. Loss of function mutations in Patched1, which aberrantly activates hedgehog signaling, result in overproliferation of granule cell precursors in the cerebellum (41Wechsler-Reya R.J. Scott M.P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Because Hh and Dyrk1/mnb pathways are important for central nervous system development, it is interesting to speculate whether or not both these pathways interact with each other during neuronal development in vivo. Future studies will focus on the potential for Hh and Dyrk1 pathways to interact with each other during neuronal development through modulating Gli transcriptional activity.

https://openalex.org/W2016473921,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), an inducible form of the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the synthesis of prostanoids, has been shown to be overexpressed in a wide range of tumors and possesses proangiogenic and antiapoptotic properties. To understand the molecular mechanism of Cox-2 action we used adenovirus-mediated transfer of rat Cox-2 cDNA into renal rat mesangial cells and determined the differential gene expression using cDNA microarrays. One of the several genes that were highly up-regulated by over expressed Cox-2 was MDR1. MDR1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the product of the MDR1 gene, is implicated as the primary cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumors where it acts as an efflux pump for chemotherapeutic agents. It is also expressed in normal tissues of the liver and kidney where it functions to actively transport lipophilic xenobiotics. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis confirmed the results of the microarray, showing increased mRNA levels for MDR1 in Cox-2 overexpressing cells. This increase in mRNA translated to an increase in MDR1 protein expression, which was dose-dependent on Cox-2 expression. Furthermore, using rhodamine 123 efflux assay we observed a significant increase in P-gp activity in Cox-2 overexpressing renal mesangial cells. The specific Cox-2 inhibitor NS398 was able to block the Cox-2-mediated increase in MDR1 expression and activity, suggesting that Cox-2 products may be implicated in this response. These results prove the existence of a causal link between Cox-2 and P-gp activity, which would have implications for kidney function and multidrug resistance in tumors where Cox-2 is overexpressed."

We have characterized a T. brucei gene called FRDg encoding a protein 35% identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae fumarate reductases. Microsequencing of FRDg purified from glycosome preparations, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analyses clearly identified this enzyme as a glycosomal protein that is only expressed in the procyclic form of T. brucei but is present in all the other trypanosomatids studied, i.e. Trypanosoma congolense, Crithidia fasciculata andLeishmania amazonensis. The specific inactivation ofFRDg gene expression by RNA interference showed that FRDg is responsible for the NADH-dependent fumarate reductase activity detected in glycosomal fractions and that at least 60% of the succinate secreted by the T. brucei procyclic form (in the presence of d-glucose as the sole carbon source) is produced in the glycosome by FRDg. We conclude that FRDg plays a key role in the energy metabolism by participating in the maintenance of the glycosomal NAD+/NADH balance. We have also detected a significant pyruvate kinase activity in the cytosol of the T. brucei procyclic cells that was not observed previously.

Tielens A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or FADH2/FMNH2 (2Muratsubaki H. Enomoto K. Ichijoh Y. Tezuka T. Katsume T. Prep. Biochem. 1994; 24: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a key role in the anaerobic metabolism of many prokaryotes and eukaryotes (green algae, parasitic helminths, yeast, and some lower marine organisms) (1Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 3Tielens A.G. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Most of the FRDs characterized to date are membrane-bound proteins closely related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reverse reaction (the oxidation of succinate) (1Van Hellemond J.J. Tielens A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These FRD enzymes belong to a multimeric complex embedded in the mitochondrial membrane that is similar to complex II of the respiratory chain (succinate dehydrogenase complex), which is part of an electron transfer chain. In this case, FRD transfers electrons from a quinol to a fumarate, which is the terminal electron acceptor and thus is directly involved, under anaerobic conditions, in ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, the FRDs described inShewanella putrefaciens (4Pealing S.L. Black A.C. Manson F.D. Ward F.B. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12132-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Muratsubaki H. Enomoto K. Ichijoh Y. Tezuka T. Katsume T. Prep. Biochem. 1994; 24: 289-296PubMed Google Scholar) are soluble proteins not associated with membrane-bound multimeric complexes. Although soluble, theShewanella FRD seems to be involved in an electron transfer chain with a quinol as the electron donor as observed for the membrane-bound FRD (4Pealing S.L. Black A.C. Manson F.D. Ward F.B. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12132-12140Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the yeast FRD is unique, because this soluble enzyme uses FADH2/FMNH2 as electron donor, is not linked to an electron transfer chain, and is not involved in oxidative phosphorylation (2Muratsubaki H.

The trypanosomatid family is composed of protists belonging to the order Kinetoplastida, which represents one of the earliest evolutionary branches in the eukaryotic lineage. All known trypanosomatids are parasites, and some of them cause serious diseases in man (Leishmania, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the African trypanosomes Trypanosoma brucei gambiense andTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense), domestic animals (many African trypanosome species), and plants (Phytomonas). During their life cycle, African trypanosomes (including T. brucei) differentiate into several adaptive forms, the most prominent being the bloodstream form in the mammalian host and the procyclic form in the midgut of the tsetse fly vector. In all trypanosomatids most glycolytic enzymes are found in specific organelles, the glycosomes, which are microbody-like organelles related to peroxisomes (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 7Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The bloodstream form of the T. brucei group possesses a unique and simple energy metabolism as compared with all other adaptative forms of trypanosomatids (8Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Michels P.A. Hannaert V. Bringaud F. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The T. bruceibloodstream form converts d-glucose into 3-phosphoglycerate inside the glycosome, whereas the last three steps leading to pyruvate are in the cytosol (7Opperdoes F.R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The absence of a tricarboxylic acid cycle and a respiratory system coupled to ATP synthesis implies that all of the ATP required for anabolic pathways is produced by the cytosolic pyruvate kinase with the pyruvate being the only end product secreted under aerobic conditions. In contrast, all other trypanosomatid adaptative forms, including the procyclic form of the T. brucei group, have a mitochondrion functional in ATP production coupled to aerobic respiration (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 10Cazzulo J.J.

In addition, these parasites may produce several incompletely oxidized products of aerobic fermentation such as ethanol, succinate, acetate, alanine, pyruvate, and glycerol and/or lactate (10Cazzulo J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3153-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All of these parasites secrete succinate, but the pathway(s) leading to succinate production is (are) not clearly understood (8Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Parasitol.

Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2023-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the enzyme(s) responsible for the production of the secreted succinate is still debated as is the relevance of this activity in the energy metabolism of the trypanosomatid and its subcellular localization (8Tielens A.G.M.

The RNAi tool has not yet been adapted to the other human pathogens, i.e. Leishmania sp. and T. cruzi. However, when studying pathways shared by all trypanosomatids such as carbohydrate metabolism, the T. brucei procyclic form constitutes an excellent model, and conclusions drawn from RNAi experiments with these cells may also be applicable to the other parasites. Here, we report the identification and characterization, in theT. brucei procyclic form, of a novel, abundant glycosomal enzyme (FRDg) that contains an NADH-dependent FRD activity. This protein is expressed in all trypanosomatids analyzed except the bloodstream form of T. brucei. Specific inhibition of its expression using RNAi showed that FRDg produces at least 60% of the succinate secreted by the procyclic form of T. brucei. In addition, we also showed the presence of a significant pyruvate kinase activity in the cytosol of the procyclic form. Thus, on the basis of these new data we propose a revision in the current model of glycosomal and mitochondrial carbohydrate metabolism in trypanosomatids that was established about 15 years ago (6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 183-224Crossref Google Scholar, 10Cazzulo J.J.

Authié) was grown as described previously (26Ross C.A. Acta Trop. 1987; 44: 293-301PubMed Google Scholar). The epimastigote form of T. cruzi C. L. (provided by P. Minoprio, Pasteur Institute, Paris) was cultured and prepared as described (27Taylor A.E.R. Baker J.R. In Vitro Methods for Parasite Cultivation. Academic Press, London1978Google Scholar), the Crithidia fasciculata clone HS6 was grown as described (28Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar), and the promastigote form of Leishmania amazonensis MHOM/BR/87/BA125 was cultured at 26 °C in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Glycosomes were purified from procyclic (EATRO1125) and bloodstream (AnTat1) forms ofT. brucei as described (29Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Spits H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) after homogenizing the cells in STE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) with silicon carbide as grinding material (30Toner J.J. Weber M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Glycosomal proteins (500 μg) isolated from the EATRO1125 procyclic cells were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted on nylon PSQ filters (Immobilon), and stained with Amido Schwarz. The band containing the 120-kDa protein (p120) was cut out and submitted to trypsin digestion at 25 °C for 18 h in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.01% Tween, and 0.3 μg of trypsin. Peptides were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography, and the N-terminal extremity of major peaks as well as the undigested p120 were microsequenced as described (31Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Peptide sequences and their positions on the p120 gene product are as follows: N-term, 2VDGRSSASIVAVDPERAARERDAAA26; p48b, 152NACLEALTQA161; p40,195YIVDYVIDNINAAGFQNVF213; p48a,251EASYISVISLDNEALATSGD270; p39,473ADAIGWLTSLGVPLTVLSQ491; p34,600EHAPHLVNFP609; p25,717KLFGVSSHEFYWK729; p43,822APLSHSNPILGLFGAGEVT840; p32,883VWTTVVLR890; and p35,964EWISALEPGDAVEMK978. BLAST searches in the data base of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR;http://www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/index.html) revealed that peptides p40, p48a, and p48b are encoded by the extremities of clone SH-37B24. A PCR product (pr37B24) obtained from genomic DNA of T. bruceiEATRO1125 by using primers derived from the SH-37B24-R sequence (TIGR data base) was used as a α-32P-labeled probe to screen a genomic library of T. brucei AnTat1 constructed in the c2X75 cosmid vector (32Bringaud F. Vedrenne C. Cuvillier A. Parzy D. Baltz D. Tetaud E. Pays E. Venegas J. Merlin G. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The selected CosFRD11 clone wasHpaI-digested and subcloned into theHincII-digested pUC18 vector (Appligene), and the resulting recombinant colonies were screened with the α-32P-labeled pr37B24 probe to isolate the full-length p120 gene, which was sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (ABI PRISMTM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA and amino acid sequences were analyzed using the DNA STRIDER program, and data base searches were done with BLAST. For the phylogenetic analysis, the central domain of FRDg (from amino acid positions 406 to 839) was aligned with the corresponding region of homologous proteins (fumarate reductases and succinate dehydrogenases) from other organisms. Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences and hamming distances were obtained using Clustal W version 1.6 (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using version 3.5c of the PHYLIP program package of J. Felsenstein (BLAST, Clustal W and PHYLIP were obtained through the Bisance and Infobiogen facilities). The matrix of pairwise sequence distances were calculated by Dayhoff's method using PRODIST. The unrooted phylogenetic trees were constructed from the distance matrix using the neighbor or Fitch methods. The phylogenetic tree was drawn with TREEVIEW version 1.3 (34Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The statistical robustness of the resulting phylogenetic tree was assessed with the SeqBoot program by bootstrap resampling analysis generating 100 reiterated data sets. The resulting bootstrap values were added manually at each corresponding node. To inhibit FRDg expression by RNAi (16Ngo H. Tschudi C. Gull K. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), we generated a “sense/antisense” cassette in the pLew79 expression vector (kindly provided by E. Wirtz and G. Cross) (35Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) that targets the 3′-end of the FRDg gene (195 bp) followed by 258 bp of the untranslated region. The plasmid construction was performed as reported previously for the inhibition of a flagellar protein (FTZC) expression by RNAi (19Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PCR-amplified, 489-bp antisense sequence (453 bp of the targeted sequence plus 36 bp used as a spacer between the sense and antisense sequences) was inserted in the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew79 plasmid. Then, a PCR-amplified 453-bp sense sequence was inserted upstream of the antisense sequence in theHindIII and AvrII restriction sites (AvrII was introduced at the 5′ extremity of the antisense PCR fragment). The resulting plasmid, pLew-FRDg-SAS, contained a chimeric construct composed of the sense and antisense version of aFRDg gene fragment, separated by a 36-bp fragment, under the control of the tetracycline-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase promoter (35Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The EATRO1125 procyclic form cell line (EATRO1125.T7T) expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and the tetracycline repressor under the dependence of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for inducible control by tetracycline (19Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or wild type EATRO1125 procyclic cells were transformed with the pLew-FRDg-SAS plasmid. Trypanosome transfection and selection of phleomycin-resistant clones were performed as reported previously (19Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sonicated (5 s at 4 °C) crude extracts of trypanosomes resuspended in STE buffer and glycosomal fractions resuspended in STE buffer were tested for enzymatic activities. For NADH-dependent fumarate reductase and cytochrome c reductase assays, succinate or reduced cytochrome c formation was measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm via oxidation of NADH (11Mracek J. Snyder S.J. Chavez U.B. Turrens J.F. J. Protozool. 1991; 38: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase activity was measured in the absence of its activator (fructose 2,6-bisphosphate) as described (37Callens M. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (38Denise H. Giroud C. Barrett M.P. Baltz T. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 4497-4503Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and fumarase (43Hunter F.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1960; 9: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) activities were all measured according to published procedures. To determine the rate of d-glucose consumption, 109 procyclic cells (exponential phase) were collected by centrifugation, washed in PBS buffer, and resuspended in 10 ml of fresh SDM-79 medium containing 10% calf serum. The cells were incubated for 8 h, and samples (50 μl) were collected at 30 min intervals. Each sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 30 s, and the quantity of d-glucose remaining in the supernatant was determined using a glucose trinder kit (Sigma). For pH measurements, procyclic cells (105cells·ml−1) were grown in 20 ml of SDM-79 medium containing 10% calf serum until reaching the stationary phase (after about 5 days). The pH value was determined on the supernatant of centrifuged aliquots (1 ml) using a pH meter. Procyclic EATRO1125 cells were washed in PBS buffer and resuspended at 6.5 × 108 cells·ml−1 (3.3 mg of protein) in STE buffer supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and the CompleteTM mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell aliquots (300 μl) were incubated for 4 min at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of digitonin before being centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 2 min as described previously (44Marche S. Michels P.A. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities that were released from the cells were assayed in the supernatants. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the 23 C-terminal amino acids of the p120 protein and containing an additional N-terminal cysteine residue (CTLGYNMNLVRTVDETEPSGSSKI) was covalently linked to an ovalbumin carrier and used to immunize a rabbit as described (45). The p120 specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using the same peptide covalently linked to activated CH-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. For Western blot analyses, total extracts of the bloodstream form AnTat1 and procyclic form EATRO1125 of T. brucei(107 cells) or glycosomal fractions of the same parasites (10 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and immunoblotted on Immobilon-P filters (Millipore) (45). Immunodetection was performed as described (45, 46) using, as primary antibodies, affinity-purified anti-FRDg and rabbit anti-GPDH (36Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 38Denise H. Giroud C. Barrett M.P. Baltz T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) diluted 1:100 and, as secondary antibodies, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), respectively. For immunofluorescence analyses, log phase cells were fixed with formaldehyde as described previously (36Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Slides were incubated with affinity-purified anti-FRDg antibodies and monoclonal mouse anti-PPDK H112 followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody diluted 1:100 (Bio-Rad) and Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:100 (Molecular Probes), respectively. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss UV microscope, and images were captured by a MicroMax-1300Y/HS camera (Princeton Instruments) and MetaView software (Universal Imaging) and merged in Adobe Photoshop on a Macintosh iMac computer. 4 × 109 T. brucei procyclic cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min, washed once in PBS buffer, and incubated in 10 ml of incubation buffer (PBS buffer supplemented with 24 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3) containing 11 mmd-[1-13C]glucose (110 μmole) for 90–180 min at 27 °C. d-glucose concentration in the medium was determined with thed-glucose trinder kit (Sigma). The integrity of the cells during the incubation was checked by microscopic observation. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,400 × g, the supernatant was lyophilized, resuspended in 500 μl of D2O, and 50 μl of pure dioxane was added as an external reference. 13C NMR spectra were collected at 100.6 MHz. Measurements were recorded at 25 °C with a proton composite pulse decoupling. Acquisition conditions were 90° flip angle, 22.15 kHz spectral width, 64K memory size, and 21.5-s total recycle time. Measurements were performed overnight with 2,048 scans. Spectra were collected after a 1 Hz exponential line broadening.1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and referenced to the dioxane resonance at 3.75 ppm. The residual water signal was reduced by homonuclear presaturation. Spectra were collected using 90° flip angle, 6-s relaxation delay, 8.05-s total recycle time, 4-KHz spectra width, and 32K memory size. The specific 13C enrichment of lactate (C3), acetate (C2), fumarate,l-malate, and succinate (C2 and C3) were determined from1H-NMR spectra as the ratio of the area of the satellites (13C-1H coupling) to the total area of the corresponding multiplet. The amount of secreted products was calculated on the basis of the specific enrichment values and the carbon-13 content for each metabolite at the position of interest using the enriched C1 glucose as a quantitative reference. We previously characterized a pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) as a 97-kDa glycosomal protein expressed in the procyclic form but absent in the bloodstream form of T. brucei (36Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the course of this study, an abundant 120-kDa glycosomal protein (p120) presenting the same differential expression was detected (Fig. 1 A). To characterize this unknown protein, it was purified from glycosomal fractions, and nine peptides generated by its tryptic digestion were purified and microsequenced. In addition, the N-terminal extremity of the purified p120 protein was sequenced. A DNA fragment (SH-37B24-R) encoding 3 of 10 p120 peptidic sequences was identified in the T. brucei GSS data base (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/index.html) and used as a probe to clone (from a T. brucei cosmid genomic library) a full-length gene encoding a 1142-amino acid protein that contains all 10 peptidic seq"
https://openalex.org/W1996839988,"The gastrointestinal hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), is one of the most important regulators of insulin secretion following ingestion of a meal. GIP stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreatic β-cell via its G protein-coupled receptor activation of adenylyl cyclase and other signal transduction pathways, but there is little known regarding subsequent protein kinase pathways that are activated. A screening technique was used to determine the relative abundance of 75 protein kinases in CHO-K1 cells expressing the GIP receptor and in two pancreatic β-cell lines (βTC-3 and INS-1 (832/13) cells). This information was used to identify kinases that are potentially regulated following GIP stimulation, with a focus on GIP regulation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway. In CHO-K1 cells, GIP induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 (Ser-259), Mek1/2 (Ser-217/Ser-221), ERK1/2 (Thr-202 and Tyr-204), and p90 RSK (Ser-380) in a concentration-dependent manner. Activation of ERK1/2 was maximal at 4 min and was cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent and protein kinase C-independent. Studies using a β-cell line (INS-1 clone 832/13) corroborated these findings, and it was also demonstrated that the ERK1/2 module could be activated by GIP in the absence of glucose. Finally, we have shown that GIP regulation of the ERK1/2 module is via Rap1 but does not involve Gβγ subunits nor Src tyrosine kinase, and we propose that cAMP-based regulation occurs via B-Raf in both CHO-K1 and β-cells. These results establish the importance of GIP in the cellular regulation of the ERK1/2 module and identify a role for cAMP in coupling its G protein-coupled receptors to ERK1/2 activity in pancreatic β-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2140576556,"In this study we used adenovirus vector-mediated transduction of either the p53 gene (rAd-p53) or the p21WAF1/CIP1 gene (rAd-p21) to mimic both p53-dependent and -independent up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 within a human ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, and the derivative cell lines, 2774qw1 and 2774qw2. We observed that rAd-p53 can induce apoptosis in both 2774 and 2774qw1 cells but not in 2774qw2 cells. Surprisingly, overexpression of p21WAF1/CIP1also triggered apoptosis within these two cell lines. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the differential expression of BAX, BCL2, and caspase 3 genes, specific in rAd-p53-induced apoptotic cells, was not altered in rAd-p21-induced apoptotic cells, suggesting p21WAF1/CIP1-induced apoptosis through a pathway distinguishable from p53-induced apoptosis. Expression analysis of 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p21 on 60,000 cDNA microarrays identified 159 genes in response to p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in at least one time point with 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. Integration of the data with the parallel microarray experiments with rAd-p53 infection allowed us to extract 66 genes downstream of both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 and 93 genes in response to p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in a p53-independent pathway. The genes in the former set may play a dual role in both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, and the genes in the latter set gave a mechanistic molecular explanation for p53-independent p21WAF1/CIP1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, promoter sequence analysis suggested that transcription factor E2F family is partially responsible for the differential expression of genes following p21WAF1/CIP1.

Although a downstream effector of p53 mediated G1 arrest, the role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in the apoptotic pathway remains controversial. In this study, we use adenovirus vector-mediated transduction of p53 (rAd-p53)1 or p21WAF1/CIP1 gene (rAd-p21) to mimic p53-dependent and -independent up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 within the human ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, and its derivative cell lines, 2774qw1 and 2774qw2. These cell lines harbor endogenous mutant p53, which allows the ectopic expression of wild-type p53. We observed that in this particular system rAd-p21 induced apoptosis in 2774 and 2774qw1 cells in a p21WAF1/CIP1-specific manner. Furthermore, a small scale and a genome-wide expression analysis were performed to investigate the downstream events regulated by p21WAF1/CIP1. The human ovarian cancer cell line, 2774, was obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC). 2774 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The derived cell lines, 2774qw1 and 2774qw2, were cultured under identical conditions to the parental cell line, 2774. Sequence analyses were carried out by Geneka Biotechnology, Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Briefly, reverse transcription from random decamers was performed on RNA obtained from 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 cells by using the RNeasy kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). 35 cycles of PCR with Vent polymerase and p53-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-TCCGGGTCACTGCCATGGAGGAGCCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGGAGAATGTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCC-3′) were used to amplify p53 cDNA. DNA sequencing was performed using multiple IR dye-labeled primers (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NB) and the SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA sequencing kit-LC (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI). The reactions were analyzed on a model 4200 Long ReadIR automated DNA sequencer (Li-Cor). Human ovarian tumor cells, 2774, and 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 cells were infected with rAd-p21, rAd-p53, or rAd-empty vector at concentrations of 1 × 1010particles/ml for 1 h. Following the incubation, the media for all cell samples were replaced with fresh media, not containing virus, and cells were harvested at the indicated hour post-infection. NEXIN™ assay (Guava, Inc.) was used for the staining of the cells with annexin V, and the TUNEL assay was performed with ApopTag™ staining kit (Intergen). Apoptosis analysis followed the manufacturer's instructions. 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p21, rAd-p53, and rAd-empty vector were harvested at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h post-infection. All time points were performed in duplicate. The cells were trypsinized, and washed with D-PBS. The sample was fixed by slowly dropping 2 ml of cold 95% ethanol into the tube followed by storage at 4 °C. After fixation, the cells were washed, re-pelleted, and resuspended in 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.0005% Triton X-100, 44.5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml RNase in PBS. The sample was incubated at room temperature for 30 min, filtered through a 35-μm nylon mesh filter, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen). Cell cycle data originally obtained with Cell Quest software (BD PharMingen) was re-analyzed using MODFIT software (Verity Software, Topsham, ME). RNA preparation and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed essentially as described previously (26Wang L., Wu, Q. Qiu P. Mirza A. McGuirk M. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Wang Y. Pickett C.B. Liu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43604-43610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The total RNA was purified from 2774qw1 cells infected with 1010particles/ml of rAd-p21 or rAd-empty vector at various time points, and poly(A) mRNA was isolated using oligotex beads (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). For each probe pair, poly(A) mRNA was fluorescently labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent dyes and hybridized on Incyte GeneAlbum 1–6 at Incyte (Incyte Genomics, Palo Alto, CA) using their proprietary technology as described (27DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3707) Google Scholar). 2Incyte Pharmaceuticals, unpublished data. The promoter sequences for the genes on microarray were collected as described previously (26Wang L., Wu, Q. Qiu P. Mirza A. McGuirk M. Kirschmeier P. Greene J.R. Wang Y. Pickett C.B. Liu S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43604-43610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The human subset of transcription factor binding site consensus sequences was retrieved from TRANSFAC data base (28Wigender E. Dietz P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 29Wigender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The “FindPatterns” program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 10) was used to match consensus DNA-binding site in the promoters. The human ovarian cancer cell line 2774 carries an arginine to histidine mutation in codon 273 of the p53 gene and was initially selected for this study based on its infectivity (>90%) with adenovirus (30Santoso J.T. Tang D.-C. Lane S.B. Hung J. Reed D.J. Muller C.Y. Carbone D.S. Mathis J.M. Gynecol. Oncol. 1995; 59: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To determine the temporal profile of cell cycle status of 2774 cells after infection with rAd-p53 or rAd-p21, FACS analysis of cellular DNA determined that the 2774 cells represent a mixed cell population (data not shown). Therefore, several single clones were isolated, and multiple distinct cell morphologies were observed. 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 are single cell clones based on FACS analysis and were representative of two of these cell types (data not shown). The p53 status of these three cell lines was determined by sequencing of the coding sequence of the p53 gene. The results indicated that the parental 2774 cell line and the two single cell clones harbor a missense mutation at codon 273 (CGT to CAT, arginine to histidine). This is one of the common mutational hot spots common in the p53 protein (31Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4023-4037PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed that 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 cells harbor different additional p53 mutations. The amino acid at the codon 72 of the p53 sequence from 2774qw1 cells was a proline substitution for the arginine, which was not found in the p53 sequence from the 2774qw2 cells. The amino acid at codon 309 of the p53 sequence from 2774qw2 cells was a serine substitution for the proline, which was not found in the p53 sequence from the 2774qw1 cells. This suggests heterogenicity of the parental cell line, 2774. To determine the optimal concentration of adenoviruses used for transducing p53, multiple concentrations of rAd-p53 and adenovirus containing an empty vector (rAd-empty vector) were used to infect 2774qw1 cells for 2–24 h. The maximal rAd-p53-induced apoptosis was observed in 2774qw1 cells infected with 1 × 1010 particle/ml of rAd-p53, whereas little vector toxicity with the cells infected with the same concentration of rAd-empty vector. 3A. Mirza et al., submitted for publication. A similar concentration of rAd-p21 was used in the following experiments. The levels of expression of transgenes, p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1, were monitored in 2774qw1 cells at 2–24 h post-infection of rAd-p53 and rAd-p21, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis detects exogenous p53 mRNA as early as 2 h post-infection with rAd-p53, with the p53 protein observed 6 h post-infection (32Mirza A. McGuirk M. Hockenberry T.N., Wu, Q. Ashar H. Black S. Wen S.F. Wang L. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. Nielsen L.L. Pickett C.B. Liu S. Oncogene. 2001; 21: 2613-2622Crossref Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The activation of endogenous p21WAF1/CIP1, a known p53 target gene, by the overexpression of exogenous p53 was observed in the rAd-p53-infected cells. The level of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression induced by rAd-p21-infection was 100-fold higher than what was detected in the rAd-p53-infected cells. It should be noted that the primer/probe reagents used in these RT-PCR experiments can not discriminate between the exogenous and endogenous p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA. The viral transduction efficiency in 2774, 2774qw1, and 2774qw2 was estimated by infection of 1 × 1010 particle/ml of the adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase. The results of β-galactosidase staining indicated that ∼86–89% transduction efficiency occurred in 2774qw1 cells at 2–24 h post-infection, and similar results were obtained with 2774 and 2774qw2 cell lines. We next evaluated whether rAd-p53 infection could induce apoptosis in the two 2774-derived clones, 2774qw1 and 2774qw2, using annexin V staining. The parental cell line 2774 was included in these assays as a reference. The cells at 20 h post-infection of rAd-p53 or rAd-empty vector were fixed and stained with annexin V. Apoptotic cells were quantified by counting annexin V-positive cells, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Strikingly, rAd-p53 induced a significant level of apoptosis in 2774 and 2774qw1 cells (Fig. 1 A). In contrast to these cell lines, rAd-p53-infected 2774qw2 cells does not elicit apoptosis (Fig. 1 A). We were surprised to observe that rAd-p21 can also trigger apoptosis within the parental 2774 and 2774qw1 cell lines (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, our data indicated that 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 derived from the same parental 2774 cell line exhibit distinct cellular morphologies and apoptotic effects in response to rAd-p53 and rAd-p21 infection. Microscopic analysis of TUNEL staining was used to further evaluate the apoptotic effect of 2774 and 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p53 and rAd-p21 observed in Guava Nexin assay. The nuclei of control cells showed no staining without adenovirus infection (MOCK), indicating that cells were healthy and their nuclei were intact. Furthermore, 2774qw1 cells did not exhibit TUNEL staining at 20 h post-infection of rAd-empty vector. In contrast, a fraction of the 2774qw1 cells exhibited the typical strong yellow-green TUNEL staining at 20 h post-infection with either rAd-p53 or rAd-p21 (Fig. 1 B). The observations of these TUNEL-positive cells demonstrated typical characteristics of apoptosis, such as condensed and shrunken nuclei, and were clearly distinguishable from normal nuclei. These data confirmed that the observed DNA fragmentation induced by both rAd-p53 and rAd-p21 infection of 2774qw1 cells correlated with morphological apoptotic features. Similar observations were made in parental 2774 cell line (Fig. 1 C), whereas no apoptotic response was detected in 2774qw2 cells (data not shown). To assess the effect of rAd-p53 and rAd-p21 on cell cycle progression, population distribution throughout the cell cycle in 2774qw1 cells was determined using flow cytometry. A comparison of the cell cycle profiles of rAd-p21-, rAd-p53-, and rAd-empty vector-infected 2774qw1 cells confirms that p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 transgene-specific effects can be detected. By using the percent of cells in G0/G1 phase as an analytical end point, infection with rAd-p53 or rAd-p21 shifted cells to a G1 arrest in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Notably, 20 and 24 h after rAd-p21 infection the 2774qw1 cells demonstrate a significant G1 arrest (p < 0.05) in comparison to uninfected cells (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, infection with rAd-p53 resulted in a significant reduction in S phase cell number that started 20 h post-infection. Infection with rAd-p21 also decreases the S-phase population but to a lesser extent compared with rAd-p53 (Fig. 2 B). The differences seen when comparing the G0/G1 or S phase populations of rAd-p21- or rAd-p53-infected cells to rAd-empty vector-infected cells show significant difference as determined by a Student's t test (p < 0.1 and p < 0.05, respectively; Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these results demonstrate a 90–95% confidence in the data and signify an impact on cell cycle progression with p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 transgene expression. These results agree with the apoptosis time course presented in Fig.1 B which shows a break in the trend of data at 16 h post-infection and significant differences detected at 20 and 24 h post-infection. Analysis of the percent of cells in G2/M did not show a statistically significant difference between cells infected with rAd-p21, rAd-p53, or rAd-empty vector (Fig.2 C). In the first attempt to look at the expression patterns of two clones, 2774qw1 and 2774qw2, and their parental cell line, 2774, in response to p53 or p21WAF1/CIP1 expression, quantitative RT-PCR was used to study any changes of downstream genes in mRNA expression. RNA was isolated from the corresponding cell lines 16 h post-infection with rAd-p53 or rAd-empty vector. p53 has been shown to regulate the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, cyclin B1, BAX, andBCL2 (33El-Deiry W.S.

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of these 6 genes was performed to study the effects of rAd-p53 or rAd-empty vector on 2774qw1 or 2774qw2 cells (Table I). Interestingly, p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 mRNA levels show a similar change in the 2774qw1 cells and its parental cell line2774. In contrast, the 2774qw2 cells exhibited a much higher induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and MDM2 gene expression. Overall, the 2774qw1 cells showed similar expression profile to its parental 2774 cell line, whereas the 2774qw2 cells did not.Table IDifferential expression (fold change) of 6 genes in 2774qw1 and 2774qw2 clones and their parental 2774 cells 16 h post-infection of rAd-p53 as compared with rAd-emptyGeneFold change (rAd-p53 vs. rAd-empty vector)27742774qw12774qw2p21WAF1/CIP1137154306MDM25.48.424.3BAX5.17.53.6BCL2−6.2−5.6NC1-aNC, no change (<3-fold compared with control).Cyclin B1−2.6−9.1ND1-bND, no determination.Caspase 315.114.6ND1-a NC, no change (<3-fold compared with control).1-b ND, no determination. Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the apoptotic role of p21WAF1/CIP1 in a p53-independent pathway, we compared the expression profiles of 2774qw1 cells with rAd-p53 infection and rAd-p21 infection. 5 apoptosis- and cell cycle-related genes were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Both p21WAF1/CIP1 and caspase 3 mRNAs were activated by p53 in all time points tested. After rAd-p53-induced apoptosis takes place, all 5 genes showed differential expression (Fig. 1 and TableII). In contrast, rAd-p21-infected cells showed substantial induction of p21WAF1/CIP1, which resulted from transgene expression as expected, and repression of cyclin B1. Interestingly, we observed no detectable activation of caspase 3,BAX, and BCL2 mRNAs when p21WAF1/CIP1-induced apoptosis occurred in 2774qw1 cells (Table II). This suggests that p21WAF1/CIP1 alone induces apoptosis in a pathway distinguishable from p53-induced apoptosis.Table IITemporal differential expression (fold change) of 5 genes in 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p53 or rAd-p21 as compared with rAd-empty, respectivelyAdenovirusGeneHours post-infection481624rAd-p53 vs. rAd-empty vectorap21WAF1/CIP1179167137149Cyclin B1NCNC−5.0−7.1Caspase 34.321.715.744.7BAXNC4.14.46.8BCL2NCNC−6.2−7.5rAd-p21 vs. rAd-empty vectorp21WAF1/CIP15254,3755,7938,750Cyclin B1NC−5.0−4.5−3.5Caspase 3NCNCNCNCBAXNCNCNCNCBCLt2NCNCNCNC Open table in a new tab High density microarray technology allows a genome-wide identification of genes downstream of p21WAF1/CIP1. To do so, mRNA isolated from 2774qw1 cells 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h post-infection of 1010particles/ml rAd-p21 or rAd-empty vector were hybridized to 6 microarrays, containing ∼60,000 cDNAs. A total of 159 genes were altered in a time-dependent response to rAd-p21 infection using 2.5-fold change as a cutoff. Performance of the hybridization was assessed by analyses of 3 genes that have multiple cDNA clones represented on the microarrays (TableIII). Overall, there was good consistency between the signals observed between the different cDNA clones on the microarrays. It was observed that the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was the most induced in the microarray experiments. The p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA level in 2774qw1 cells infected with rAd-p21 was up-regulated 4 h post-infection (4.7-fold) and reached maximal up-regulation at 20 and 24 h post-infection (10.7- and 10.4-fold, respectively) when compared with cells infected with rAd-empty vector. The results confirmed the quantitative RT-PCR data presented in Table II. Nevertheless, we noticed that the microarray data generally underestimated the differential expression as compared with Taqman analysis. Similar observations were made in several independent microarray experiments in other laboratories (21Chang B.-D. Watanabe K. Broude E.V. Fang J. Poole J.C. Kalinichenko T.V. Roninson I. Proc. Natl.

We noticed that the majority of genes that showed differential expression was repressed. Therefore, a reverse fluorescence hybridization experiment was performed.

Parallel microarray experiments were carried out using mRNA isolated from 2774qw1 cells 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h post-infection of 1010 particles/ml rAd-p53 or rAd-empty vector. 1,501 genes were identified in response to rAd-p53 infection in at least one time point with 2.5-fold change as a cutoff.3The combination of these two sets of microarray data enables us to identify genes downstream of p21WAF1/CIP1 in a p53-independent pathway. Overall, the number of genes in response to p53 expression exceeded that observed in response to p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. Obviously, this seems likely because p21WAF1/CIP1 itself is not a transcription factor. Because p21WAF1/CIP1 is transcriptionally activated by wild-type p53, some genes downstream of p21WAF1/CIP1 may also be in the p53-dependent pathway as well. Our experiments identified that 76 cDNAs, representing 66 genes (61 known genes and 5 unannotated ESTs), were downstream of both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1. Meanwhile, 96 cDNAs regulated by p21WAF1/CIP1, representing 93 genes (55 known genes and 38 unannotated ESTs), did not overlap with a p53 response. All annotated genes are marked based on the earliest time point they started showing differential expression, designated as early, intermediate, and late responsive genes are listed in TableIV. The genes that respond to both p53 and p21WAF1/CIP1 may play a dual role in p53-dependent and -independent pathways. As expected, up-regulation of p21WAF1/CIP1 mRNA was observed in both sets of microarray data. The rest of the genes could possibly provide a molecular mechanistic explanation of p53-independent p21WAF1/CIP1-induced apoptosis.Table IVGenes in response to rAd-p21 infection in 2774qw1 cellsAccession no.Gene definitionResponse4-aGene showed >2.5-fold up- or down-regulation compared with control. to p21WAF1/CIP1Temporal response4-bEarly = 4 and 8 h post-infection; intermediate ="

To investigate the physiological role of CRBP II, the gene encoding CRBP II was inactivated. The saturable component of intestinal retinol uptake is impaired in CRBP II −/− mice. The knockout mice, while maintained on a vitamin A-enriched diet, have reduced (40%) hepatic vitamin A stores but grow and reproduce normally. However, reducing maternal dietary vitamin A to marginal levels during the latter half of gestation results in 100% mortality/litter within 24 h after birth in the CRBP II −/− line but no mortality in the wild type line. The neonatal mortality in heterozygote offspring of CRBP II −/− dams (79 ± 21% deaths/litter) was increased as compared with the neonatal mortality in heterozygote offspring of wild type dams (29 ± 25% deaths per litter, p < 0.05). Maternal CRBP II was localized by immunostaining in the placenta at 18 days postcoitum as well as in the small intestine.

Retinol supports all known functions of vitamin A, but retinoic acid does not support the function of vision (since retinal is the chromophore) or reproduction except when administered in pharmacological doses (1Goodman D.S.

Ong D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). During embryonic days E8.5–9.5,CRBP II transcripts have been detected in uterine decidua and trophoblastic cells, and between E10.5 and E15, CRBP IItranscripts are restricted to the yolk sac (16Sapin V. Ward S.J. Bronner S. Chambon P. Dollé P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Toward the end of gestation, CRBP II appears in the small intestine and is expressed throughout life, and CRBP II is also expressed transiently in perinatal liver and lung (17Levin M.S., Li, E. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Li E. Demmer L.A. Sweetser D.A. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast,CRBP I is expressed at high levels in the liver, kidney, eye, and genital tract but at very low levels within the small intestinal mucosa (10Ong D.E. Chytil F. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 823-832Google Scholar, 11Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Levin M.S., Li, E. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol.

Immunohistochemical localization of CRBP I in the small intestine revealed staining in the connective tissue cells in the lamina propria and in cells located within the gut-associated lymphoid tissue but not in epithelial cells (15Crow J.A. Ong D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additional murine and human cellular retinol-binding proteins, both named CRBP III, were recently described (12Conforti L. Tarlton A. Mack T.G., Mi, W. Buckmaster E.A. Wagner D. Coleman M.P. Proc.

Human CRBP III is expressed in the liver and kidney, similar to CRBP I (14Folli C. Calderone V. Ottonello S. Bolchi A. Zanotti G. Stoppini M. Berni R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and will be designated as CRBP IV in this discussion. The in vivo roles of CRBP I have been addressed through the generation and characterization of CRBP I−/− mice (20Ghyselinck N.B. Båvik C. Sapin V. Mark M. Bonnier D. Hindelang C. Dierich A. Nilsson C.B. Håkansson H. Sauvant P. Azaı̈s-Braesco Frasson M. Picaud S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). CRBP I−/− mice appear healthy and fertile while they are maintained on a vitamin A-enriched diet, but hepatic stores of retinyl esters are reduced by 50%. CRBP I knockout mice exhibit a shorter elimination half-life of liver retinoids and develop vitamin A deficiency more rapidly when subjected to a vitamin A-free diet (20Ghyselinck N.B. Båvik C. Sapin V. Mark M. Bonnier D. Hindelang C. Dierich A. Nilsson C.B. Håkansson H. Sauvant P. Azaı̈s-Braesco Frasson M. Picaud S. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4903-4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar,21Napoli J.L. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The tissue localization of CRBP II suggests that it is specifically adapted for intestinal absorption and metabolism of retinol. Stably transfected differentiated Caco-2 cells overexpressing CRBP II exhibit increased uptake and esterification of all-trans-retinol (22Levin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8267-8276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The magnitude of retinol esterification and retinol absorption was directly related to the total CRBP II content. The interconversion of retinol and retinal is mediated by multiple microsomal and cytosolic retinol dehydrogenase activities (23Kakkad B. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12916-12919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5610-5616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The addition of CRBP II to cell extracts stimulates the microsomal reduction of retinal to retinol but inhibits cytosolic reduction of retinal (24Boerman M.H.E.M. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5610-5616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To directly investigate the in vivo role of CRBP II in intestinal absorption and metabolism, we have generated CRBP II null mutant mice by targeted disruption of the mouse CRBP IIgene. Genomic clones containing exon 1 and exon 2 of the mouse CRBP II gene were obtained from a 129/Sv mouse P1 library (Genome Systems). Mapping and sequencing of genomic clones revealed that the mouse CRBP IIgene organization is similar to the rat homologue (25Demmer L.A. Birkenmeier E.H. Sweetser D.A. Levin M.S. Zollman S. Sparkes R.S. Mohandes T. Lusis A.J. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the targeting vector in which a neomycin cassette was inserted into exon 1 is depicted in Fig. 1 A. 129/Sv embryonal stem cells were electroporated with the construct and then put under positive selection with G418. One of 120 G418-resistant clones was shown to exhibit the Southern blot pattern expected for a single homologous recombination event. It was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to create chimeric mice, of which three males and one female transmitted the mutation to their offspring. Mice were genotyped initially by Southern blotting (see Fig. 1 B). Once the mutant line was established, the polymerase chain reaction was used to genotype the animals. Mice were initially bred in a mixed 129/Sv-C57BL/6 genetic background, and then backcrossed against a C57BL/6 background for at least six generations. The mice were maintained on a vitamin A-enriched rodent chow diet (PicoLab® Rodent Diet 20) containing 25 IU of retinyl ester/g. The mice were maintained under barrier conditions and fed irradiated diets. In certain experiments, the mice were placed on defined diets with marginal vitamin A content or sufficient vitamin A content as described previously (26Gardner E.M. Ross A.C. J. Nutr. 1993; 123: 1435-1443PubMed Google Scholar). The marginal vitamin A diet was a modified AIN-93G purified vitamin A-free diet (Dyets catalog no. 119134, Bethlehem, PA) with 0.6 IU of retinyl palmitate/g (Dyets catalog no. 119135). The sufficient vitamin A diet was a modified AIN-93G purified vitamin A-free diet with 4 IU of retinyl palmitate/g. Mice were placed overnight in a mating cage. Noon of the day that a vaginal plug was observed was designated embryonic day 0.5 postcoitum. Tissues were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of retinoid and mRNA levels. Frozen tissues were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendation based on improvements to the single-step RNA isolation method developed by Chomczynski and Sacchi (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Northern blots were prepared and probed with radiolabeled cDNAs. The membranes were washed once with 1× SSC (0.15m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 25 °C, once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 25 °C, and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C. The following cDNA probes were used: rat CRBP I cDNA (17Levin M.S., Li, E. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat CRBP II cDNA (18Li E. Demmer L.A. Sweetser D.A. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001; 98: 3710-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (17Levin M.S., Li, E. Ong D.E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, there was no cross-reactivity between the CRBP cDNA probes. The membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen overnight. Signals were scanned and quantitated on a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The signal densities were normalized with respect to the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA signal. Western blots of cytosolic extracts were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-rat CRBP II antiserum at a dilution of 1:5,000 and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin at a dilution of 1:10,000 (28Wang J.L. Swartz-Basile D.A. Rubin D.C. Levin M.S. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The blots were developed with a chemiluminescent substrate (enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), AmershamBiosciences). Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin. 5-μm paraffin sections were deparaffinized. To detect mature surfactant B, heat retrieval with citrate buffer (pH 6.0) under pressure (20 p.s.i.) was used to enhance staining. Sections were then treated sequentially with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min, an avidin/biotin-blocking SP-2001 solution (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA) for 20 min, and a protein block XO909 (Dako Carpenteria, CA) for 10 min. The sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against bovine mature surfactant B (a kind gift from Dr. Jeff Whitsett) at a dilution of 1:500 (29Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For immunodetection, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins coupled to horseradish peroxidase and then stained with diaminobenzamidine. CRBP II was detected without antigen retrieval using affinity-purified monospecific polyclonal rabbit anti-rat CRBP II antibody. Cross-reactive anti-CRBP I activity was absorbed out using CRBP I-Sepharose beads. The polyclonal rabbit anti-rat CRBP I antibody was further purified over CRBP II-Sepharose beads. Serum retinoids and tissue retinoids were extracted as described by Barua et al. (30Barua A.B. Duitsman P.K. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 8-16Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine total retinol (free retinol and retinyl esters), retinol was extracted after saponification of tissue homogenates in 95% ethanol/5% potassium hydroxide containing 1% pyrolgallol at 60 °C for 20 min. Retinyl acetate was added as an internal standard. Retinoids were separated over a Varian Microsorb-MV 3:m 10-cm column (Varian Associates, Walnut Creek, CA) using a 30-min linear gradient of methanol:water (3:1, v/v) containing 10 mm ammonium acetate to methanol:dichloromethane (1:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min (30Barua A.B. Duitsman P.K. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1998; 9: 8-16Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid, retinol, and retinyl esters were identified by their retention time and quantitated by comparison with standard mixtures of retinoids. Retinol uptake by jejunal segments was measured as described by Dew and Ong (31Dew S.E. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For each determination, three 0.5-cm sections were incubated at 37 °C in 5 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 125 mm NaCl, 4.93 mm KCl, 1.23 mmMgSO4, 0.85 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, pH 6.5) with 9.5 mm taurocholate containing 1 μCi of [11,12-3H(N)]-labeled all-trans-retinol (47 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 95% O2 bubbled through the medium. The nonspecific component of retinol uptake was measured in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled all-trans-retinol (Sigma). The medium also contained 0.1 μCi of [1,2-14C]polyethylene glycol (10 Ci/g, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a nonabsorbable marker. After incubating the reaction for 5 min, the segments were quickly rinsed with ice-cold buffer and solubilized in 1 ml of Beckman Tissue-Solubilizer-450 (Beckman Coulter). The solubilized radioactivity was measured after the addition of Ready Organic scintillation fluid (Beckman). Uptake of retinol was corrected for adherent fluid as determined by [14C]polyethylene glycol, which represented 10% of the tissue-associated counts. Intestinal and liver microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation as described by MacDonald and Ong (32MacDonald P.N. Ong D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19478-19482Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA:retinyl acyltransferase (ARAT) and LRAT activities were measured as described (33Ross A.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 34Herr F.M. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6748-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1.5 mm) was used to inhibit LRAT activity. Maternal and embryonic data were analyzed by diet group using the Student's t test. All numerical values are presented as means ± standard deviation. For all the studies, values were considered significantly different whenp < 0.05. To construct the targeting vector, the promoter, exon I, and a portion of intron I were replaced by a neomycin cassette (Fig.1 A). One of 120 G418-resistant clones exhibited the Southern blot pattern predicted for a single homologous recombination event. This positive clone was injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to create chimeric mice. Three male chimeras and one female transmitted the mutation to their offspring. Mice were genotyped by Southern blotting (Fig. 1 B). No CRBP II protein was detected in intestinal cell extracts or liver cell extracts prepared from 1-day-old CRBP II −/− mice (Fig.1 C). There was no immunohistochemical staining with anti-CRBP II antibody in the CRBP II −/− small intestinal epithelium (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis revealed no detectable CRBP II mRNA in CRBP II −/− intestinal RNA (Fig.3 A). As expected, hepatic CRBP II mRNA became undetectable in adult wild type mice (Fig.3 B). These studies prove that the mouse CRBP IIgene was successfully disrupted.Figure 3Altered expression of cellular retinol-binding proteins in CRBP II−/− mice. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the proximal small intestine and the liver of 3-month-old mice consuming a vitamin A-enriched diet.A, the relative concentrations of CRBP I, CRBP II, CRBP III, and CRBP IV mRNA in CRBP II +/+ andCRBP II −/− small intestines calculated from densitometric measurements of the signal intensities of the CRBPs relative to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (see “Experimental Procedures”).

There were no significant differences between the fasting serum retinol levels of 3-month-old male CRBP II +/+ (27 ± 4 μg/dl, n = 3), CRBP II +/− (23 ± 6 μg/dl, n = 11), and CRBP II −/− (30 ± 2 μg/dl,n = 7) mice or between the fasting serum retinol levels of 3-month-old female CRBP II +/+ (22 ± 3 μg/dl, n = 4), CRBP II +/−(14 ± 6 μg/dl, n = 7), and CRBP II −/− (15 ± 3 μg/dl, n = 3) mice. There was also no significant difference in the serum retinol-binding protein levels of CRBP II −/−and CRBP+/+ mice (data not shown). To minimize genetic variability, the disrupted CRBP IIallele was backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for six generations. Both wild type and CRBP II null lines in the C57BL/6 background produced average litters of six pups with no significant deviation from the expected male/female ratio of 1:1. Thus, under conditions in which the animals are fed a vitamin A-enriched diet, the absence of CRBP II does not give rise to either impaired fertility or embryonic and fetal survival. Other members of the CRBP family are expressed in the small intestine and in the liver. RNA from the small intestine and the liver was analyzed by Northern blotting to determine whether expression of other cellular retinol-binding proteins was altered in CRBP II −/− mice (Fig. 3). Low levels of CRBP I, CRBP III, and CRBP IV mRNA were detected in the small intestine of wild type and CRBP II −/− mice. Intestinal CRBP III and CRBP I mRNA levels were modestly increased by 1.5- and 2-fold, respectively, in the CRBP II −/− mice, but CRBP IV mRNA levels were not significantly different from those of wild type mice. Hepatic CRBP III mRNA was not detectable in either wild type or CRBP II −/− mice. CRBP II −/− hepatic CRBP I mRNA levels were decreased by 40%, but CRBP II −/− hepatic CRBP IV mRNA levels were increased ∼2-fold as compared with wild type levels. At low retinol concentrations, [3H]-labeled all-trans-retinol uptake in isolated jejunal segments fromCRBP II −/− mice was 50% less than jejunal segments from wild type mice (n = 3, p< 0.05). When a large excess of unlabeled retinol (100 μm) was added to assess the nonsaturable component of retinol uptake, there was no difference between the CRBP II −/− and wild type intestinal uptake. In addition, compatible with data using gut sheets from suckling rats (29Zhou L. Lim L. Costa R.H. Whitsett J.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1183-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), ∼50% of the retinol uptake represented the nonsaturable component. There was no significant difference between intestinal ARAT activity inCRBP II −/− mice (180 ± 40 pmol/min/mg,n = 3) and CRBP II +/+ (200 ± 40 pmol/min/mg, n = 3). There was also no significant difference between the intestinal lecithin:retinyl acyltransferase activity in CRBP II −/− mice (200 ± 20 pmol/min/mg, n = 3) and CRBP II +/+ mice (200 ± 30 pmol/min/mg,n = 3). As shown in Table I, total hepatic retinol content (retinol and retinyl esters) was reduced by 40% in CRBP II −/− mice. This was largely due to differences in retinyl esters since less than 5% of the total retinol content was unesterified retinol. No significant difference was detected between CRBP II −/− hepatic LRAT (80 ± 20 pmol/min/mg) and CRBP II +/+hepatic LRAT (90 ± 20 pmol/min/mg, n = 3) activity or between CRBP II −/− hepatic ARAT (100 ± 20 pmol/min/mg, n = 3) and CRBP II +/+ hepatic ARAT (100 ± 20 pmol/min/mg,n = 3) activity.Table IComparison of CRBP II−/− and wild-type liver retinoid levelsTotal ROHFree ROHμg/gμg/gCRBP II−/−480 ± 50 (n = 3)*p < 0.05.3 ± 2 (n = 3)CRBP II+/+830 ± 60 (n = 3)*p < 0.05.15 ± 15 (n = 3)Total hepatic retinol (unesterified and esterified retinol) and free retinol (unesterified retinol) were measured on 3-month-old nonpregnant female C57BL/6 CRBP II−/−and wild type mice fed an enriched vitamin A (25 IU/g) diet, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mean levels of total and free retinol ± standard deviation.* p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab Total hepatic retinol (unesterified and esterified retinol) and free retinol (unesterified retinol) were measured on 3-month-old nonpregnant female C57BL/6 CRBP II−/−and wild type mice fed an enriched vitamin A (25 IU/g) diet, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mean levels of total and free retinol ± standard deviation. When CRBP II −/− mice are fed a vitamin A-enriched rodent chow diet (25 IU/g), they appear to absorb enough vitamin A to support all vitamin A-dependent processes normally, although hepatic stores of vitamin A are reduced. Since intestinal retinol uptake is impaired at low retinol concentrations in CRBP II −/− mice, we reasoned that under conditions of low dietary intake, CRBP II −/− mice may not be able to absorb sufficient vitamin A. To address this question, pregnant dams were placed on marginal (0.6 IU/g) or sufficient (4 IU/g) vitamin A diets beginning on day 10 of gestation. This marginal vitamin A diet limited vitamin A intake by the dams and by the offspring during the postweaning period and was originally designed to produce pups with reduced hepatic retinol content and adequate serum levels without interfering with the ability of dams to produce healthy viable offspring. When CRBP II −/− dams mated withCRBP II −/− males were fed the marginal vitamin A diet from day 10 of gestation onwards, all of the pups died within 24 h of birth (see Table II). In contrast, no deaths were observed in five litters resulting from matings between wild type females and males when the female dams were subjected to the same protocol.Table IIEffect of maternal dietary vitamin A on neonatal mortality in CRBP II−/− micePaternal genotypeMaternal genotypeSufficient vitamin A diet (4 IU/g)Marginal vitamin A diet (0.6 IU/g)% deaths/litter ± S.D.% deaths/litter ± S.D.−/−−/−ND100 ± 0% (n= 2)+/+−/−6 ± 7% (n = 4)79 ± 21% (n = 5)−/−+/+0 ± 0% (n = 4)27 ± 25% (n = 5)+/++/+0 ± 0% (n = 2)0 ± 0% (n = 5)The mice were maintained on a vitamin A-enriched (25 IU/g) rodent chow diet until day 10 of gestation and then switched to either a purified diet containing either sufficient vitamin A (4 IU/g) or marginal vitamin A (0.6 IU/g).

Although there have been a number of mammalian Frizzled members identified, their binding specificities with Wnt and functions in mammalian cells have been poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in 293T cells. Rfz9 overexpression induces the hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin. Transfections of Rfz9 with each of several Wnt members show that only Wnt-2 activates Rfz9 in T cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription. Deletion mutant analysis determines that there is a difference in Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the modifications of Dvl-1 and those required for the inductions of β-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation. Deletion of the Wnt-binding domain does not abolish Rfz9 activity completely, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in the presence of Dvl-1, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane.

Direct interactions between Wnt and mammalian Frizzled were confirmed by the demonstrations that Drosophila Wingless (Wg) and Xenopus Wnt-8 (Xwnt-8) can bind to several mouse Frizzled members in 293 and COS cells (3Bhanot P.

In fact, only a few Frizzled members have been shown to function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells. In the present study, we characterize a recently identified Frizzled family member, Frizzled-9, in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Frizzled-9 is highly expressed in the brain, and its gene is one of several genes that are deleted in a developmental disorder, Williams syndrome (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The gene deletion is thought to contribute to the neurological symptoms of Williams syndrome (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells and that Rfz9 can act as a receptor for Wnt-2. Importantly, there is a difference in the Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the inductions of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) modifications and those required for β-catenin accumulation and TCF transactivation. Deletion of a large part of the CRD retains the Rfz9 activity, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin to the cell membrane in Dvl-1-dependent manner, and the Rfz9 mutants that can translocate Dvl-1 also relocalize Axin, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane.DISCUSSIONAlthough there have been a number of studies on Wnt-Frizzled interactions and signaling, most of them have involvedDrosophila genetics and Xenopus embryo studies. Even the characterization of ligand binding and signaling properties of mammalian Frizzled proteins has been carried out mostly withDrosophila and Xenopus Wnt homologs, and many of these studies have been conducted in Drosophila cell lines or Xenopus embryos. Although these studies were helpful in characterizing common protein structures and signaling mechanisms, they could neither address specificities of mammalian Wnt-Frizzled interactions nor effects of Frizzled activation in mammalian cells. In addition to the previous reports on Hfz1 and Mfz8 (27Gazit A. Yaniv A. Bafico A. Pramila T. Igarashi M. Kitajewski J. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5959-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Wu W. Glinka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the present study on Rfz9 sheds new light on these issues and uncovers a few novel aspects of the receptor function.Previous studies on Hfz9 and Mfz9 have shown that Frizzled-9 is highly expressed in the brain (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although these studies did not show that Frizzled-9 expression is brain-specific, we found that Rfz9 expression is highest in the brain. 2T. Karasawa, H. Yokokura, and P. J. Lombroso, unpublished data. It has also been shown that Frizzled-9 is expressed in neural precursor cells in the developing nervous system (42Van Raay T.J. Wang Y.K. Stark M.R. Rasmussen J.T. Francke U. Vetter M.L. Rao M.S. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hfz9 was identified by searching genes deleted in patients with Williams syndrome, a developmental neurological disorder with deficits in visuospatial cognition (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although it is still an open question whether Hfz9 is responsible for some aspects of Williams syndrome pathology, its high expression in the brain makes it likely to be involved in normal brain development. Although Hfz9 has been shown to bind Drosophila Wg (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it was not known whether Frizzled-9 functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As a first step in characterizing Frizzled-9 functions, we determined that Rfz9 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and can be specifically activated by Wnt-2. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that the WNT2 gene is an autism susceptibility gene (43Wassink T.H. Piven J. Vieland V.J. Huang J. Swiderski R.E. Pietila J. Braun T. Beck G. Folstein S.E. Haines J.L. Sheffield V.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 105: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that Wnt-2 is a possible physiological ligand for Frizzled-9, although whether the functional loss of either protein leads to developmental disorders in humans remains to be determined.With the deletion mutant analysis of Rfz9, we showed that most of the C-terminal tail domain is not required for the induction of Dvl-1 hyperphosphorylation and relocalization. We also demonstrated that Rfz9 can relocalize Axin in the presence of Dvl-1. Although the Dishevelled relocalization may have other roles, it is likely that Dishevelled acts as a carrier protein that brings Axin to the plasma membrane, where Axin is destabilized by LRP5/6 (7Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr 3rd, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The Axin relocalization and destabilization might be required for inhibiting the negative regulatory function of Axin, which leads to β-catenin stabilization and accumulation.The cell fractionation and reporter gene assays demonstrated that most of the Rfz9 C-terminal tail is necessary for the receptor-mediated accumulation of β-catenin and activation of TCF transcription. This finding is in contrast to a previous study on XenopusFrizzled-3 (Xfz3) in which the deletion of most of the C-terminal tail did not compromise the expression of the β-catenin responsive gene,Siamois (38Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal conserved motif Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp was implicated in mediating Wnt/β-catenin signaling (38Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this motif may be necessary for the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whether or not it actually mediates the signaling remains to be clarified since this motif is conserved even among Frizzled members that have not been shown to function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Thus, the motif may be only required for maintaining proper receptor conformation. The apparent discrepancy between Rfz9 and Xfz3 in functional requirements for the presence of C-terminal tails could be explained by structural differences between Rfz9 and Xfz3. Importantly, whereas the study on Xfz3 did not find a difference in the requirements for the inductions of the Dishevelled modifications and those of β-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation, the present study determined that there is such a difference in Rfz9. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether this difference is also found with other Frizzled members. Since Axin relocalization by Rfz9 and Dvl-1 is not dependent on most of Rfz9 C-terminal tail, it is likely that Axin relocalization is not sufficient to accumulate β-catenin. The Axin destabilization mediated by LRP5/6 may be required for the β-catenin accumulation, and it is possible that this process also requires most of the Rfz9 C-terminal tail. Although we did not observe any Axin destabilization by Rfz9 overexpression or coexpression of Rfz9 with Wnt-2 and/or Dvl-1, it could be because endogenous LRP5/6 activity was not high enough to induce detectable levels of the Axin destabilization.In this study, we also discovered that, even in the absence of the Wnt-binding domain, Rfz9ΔN not only relocalizes and hyperphosphorylates Dvl-1 but can also induce the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin and activate TCF transcription. The fact that it cannot be further activated by Wnt-2 is explained by the lack of the Wnt-binding domain. Whether or not Dishevelled relocalization and hyperphosphorylation induced by Frizzled are dependent on Wnt activity remains unclear, although there have been some indications that Wnt activity is responsible for these Dishevelled modifications (9Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Lee J.S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol.

Anim. 1996; 32: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is possible that there is some endogenous Wnt that can bind and activate Rfz9 in these cells, and the deletion in Rfz9ΔN leads to a conformation that is similar to activated wild-type Rfz9, thus inducing the same effect on Dvl-1. This active conformation could also be responsible for the cytosolic β-catenin accumulation and TCF transactivation by Rfz9ΔN. Another possibility is that Rfz9 isomerizes between two different states, an inactive and an active conformation even in the absence of Wnt. Although the equilibrium between the inactive and active states lies toward the inactive state, overexpression of Rfz9 could cause the absolute amount of Rfz9 protein in the active conformation to increase to the point at which basal signaling can be detected. The deletion in Rfz9ΔN could adopt a conformation that shifts the equilibrium toward the active state. The finding that Rfz9ΔN acts as a weak constitutively active mutant could be explained by an inability to interact with LRP5/6 through Wnt, making the Axin destabilization mechanism inefficient. An important function of Wnt may be to bring Frizzled and LRP5/6 together so that β-catenin becomes sufficiently accumulated, thereby inducing TCF-dependent transcription required for the cellular activities. Wnt proteins are a family of ligand molecules that play major roles in development, such as embryogenesis, cell polarity generation, and cell fate specification (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R.

The N-terminal extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) has been identified as the Wnt-binding domain (22Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between Wnt and mammalian Frizzled were confirmed by the demonstrations that Drosophila Wingless (Wg) and Xenopus Wnt-8 (Xwnt-8) can bind to several mouse Frizzled members in 293 and COS cells (3Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar, 22Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M.

Despite the fact that a number of mammalian Wnt and Frizzled members have been identified, there has been little characterization of Wnt-Frizzled binding specificities. In fact, only a few Frizzled members have been shown to function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells. In the present study, we characterize a recently identified Frizzled family member, Frizzled-9, in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Frizzled-9 is highly expressed in the brain, and its gene is one of several genes that are deleted in a developmental disorder, Williams syndrome (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The gene deletion is thought to contribute to the neurological symptoms of Williams syndrome (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that rat Frizzled-9 (Rfz9) functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in mammalian cells and that Rfz9 can act as a receptor for Wnt-2. Importantly, there is a difference in the Rfz9 C-terminal residues required for the inductions of mouse Dishevelled-1 (Dvl-1) modifications and those required for β-catenin accumulation and TCF transactivation. Deletion of a large part of the CRD retains the Rfz9 activity, although it causes the inactivation of Wnt-2-dependent TCF transcription. Rfz9 also relocalizes Axin to the cell membrane in Dvl-1-dependent manner, and the Rfz9 mutants that can translocate Dvl-1 also relocalize Axin, suggesting that one of the consequences of Dvl-1 relocalization by Rfz9 is to bring Axin to the cell membrane. DISCUSSIONAlthough there have been a number of studies on Wnt-Frizzled interactions and signaling, most of them have involvedDrosophila genetics and Xenopus embryo studies. Even the characterization of ligand binding and signaling properties of mammalian Frizzled proteins has been carried out mostly withDrosophila and Xenopus Wnt homologs, and many of these studies have been conducted in Drosophila cell lines or Xenopus embryos. Although these studies were helpful in characterizing common protein structures and signaling mechanisms, they could neither address specificities of mammalian Wnt-Frizzled interactions nor effects of Frizzled activation in mammalian cells. In addition to the previous reports on Hfz1 and Mfz8 (27Gazit A. Yaniv A. Bafico A. Pramila T. Igarashi M. Kitajewski J. Aaronson S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5959-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Wu W. Glinka A. Delius H. Niehrs C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1611-1614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the present study on Rfz9 sheds new light on these issues and uncovers a few novel aspects of the receptor function.Previous studies on Hfz9 and Mfz9 have shown that Frizzled-9 is highly expressed in the brain (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y.K. Sporle R. Paperna T. Schughart K. Francke U. Genomics. 1999; 57: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although these studies did not show that Frizzled-9 expression is brain-specific, we found that Rfz9 expression is highest in the brain. 2T. Karasawa, H. Yokokura, and P. J. Lombroso, unpublished data. It has also been shown that Frizzled-9 is expressed in neural precursor cells in the developing nervous system (42Van Raay T.J. Wang Y.K. Stark M.R. Rasmussen J.T. Francke U. Vetter M.L. Rao M.S. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Hfz9 was identified by searching genes deleted in patients with Williams syndrome, a developmental neurological disorder with deficits in visuospatial cognition (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although it is still an open question whether Hfz9 is responsible for some aspects of Williams syndrome pathology, its high expression in the brain makes it likely to be involved in normal brain development. Although Hfz9 has been shown to bind Drosophila Wg (29Wang Y.K. Samos C.H. Peoples R. Perez-Jurado L.A. Nusse R. Francke U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it was not known whether Frizzled-9 functions in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As a first step in characterizing Frizzled-9 functions, we determined that Rfz9 activates Wnt/β-catenin signaling and can be specifically activated by Wnt-2. Interestingly, a recent study suggested that the WNT2 gene is an autism susceptibility gene (43Wassink T.H. Piven J. Vieland V.J. Huang J. Swiderski R.E. Pietila J. Braun T. Beck G. Folstein S.E. Haines J.L. Sheffield V.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 105: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that Wnt-2 is a possible physiological ligand for Frizzled-9, although whether the functional loss of either protein leads to developmental disorders in humans remains to be determined.With the deletion mutant analysis of Rfz9, we showed that most of the C-terminal tail domain is not required for the induction of Dvl-1 hyperphosphorylation and relocalization. We also demonstrated that Rfz9 can relocalize Axin in the presence of Dvl-1. Although the Dishevelled relocalization may have other roles, it is likely that Dishevelled acts as a carrier protein that brings Axin to the plasma membrane, where Axin is destabilized by LRP5/6 (7Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr 3rd, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D., Li, L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The Axin relocalization and destabilization might be required for inhibiting the negative regulatory function of Axin, which leads to β-catenin stabilization and accumulation.The cell fractionation and reporter gene assays demonstrated that most of the Rfz9 C-terminal tail is necessary for the receptor-mediated accumulation of β-catenin and activation of TCF transcription. This finding is in contrast to a previous study on XenopusFrizzled-3 (Xfz3) in which the deletion of most of the C-terminal tail did not compromise the expression of the β-catenin responsive gene,Siamois (38Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal conserved motif Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp was implicated in mediating Wnt/β-catenin signaling (38Umbhauer M. Djiane A. Goisset C. Penzo-Mendez A. Riou J.F. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4944-4954Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this motif may be necessary for the Wnt/β-catenin signaling, whether or not it actually mediates the signaling remains to be clarified since this motif is conserved even among Frizzled members that have not been shown to function in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Thus, the motif may be only required for maintaining proper receptor conformation. The apparent discrepancy between Rfz9 and Xfz3 in functional requirements for the presence of C-terminal tails could be explained by structural differences between Rfz9 and Xfz3. Importantly, whereas the study on Xfz3 did not find a difference in the requirements for the inductions of the Dishevelled modifications and those of β-catenin stabilization and TCF transactivation, the present study determined that there is such a difference in Rfz9. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether this difference is also found with other Frizzled members. Since Axin relocalization by Rfz9 and Dvl-1 is not dependent on most of Rfz9 C-terminal tail, it is likely that Axin relocalization is not sufficient to accumulate β-catenin. The Axin destabilization mediated by LRP5/6 may be required for the β-catenin accumulation, and it is possible that this process also requires most of the Rfz9 C-terminal tail. Although we did not observe any Axin destabilization by Rfz9 overexpression or coexpression of Rfz9 with Wnt-2 and/or Dvl-1, it could be because endogenous LRP5/6 activity was not high enough to induce detectable levels of the Axin destabilization.In this study, we also discovered that, even in the absence of the Wnt-binding domain, Rfz9ΔN not only relocalizes and hyperphosphorylates Dvl-1 but can also induce the accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin and activate TCF transcription. The fact that it cannot be further activated by Wnt-2 is explained by the lack of the Wnt-binding domain. Whether or not Dishevelled relocalization and hyperphosphorylation induced by Frizzled are dependent on Wnt activity remains unclear, although there have been some indications that Wnt activity is responsible for these Dishevelled modifications (9Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Lee J.S. Ishimoto A. Yanagawa S. J. Biol.

Anim. 1996; 32: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is possible that there is some endogenous Wnt that can bind and activate Rfz9 in these cells, and the deletion in Rfz9ΔN leads to a conformation that is similar to activated wild-type Rfz9, thus inducing the same effect on Dvl-1. This active conformation could also be responsible for the cytosolic β-catenin accumulation and TCF transactivation by Rfz9ΔN. Another possibility is that Rfz9 isomerizes between two different states, an inactive and an active conformation even in the absence of Wnt. Although the equilibrium between the inactive and active states lies toward the inactive state, overexpression of Rfz9 could cause the absolute amount of Rfz9 protein in the active conformation to increase to the point at which basal signaling can be detected. The deletion in Rfz9ΔN could adopt a conformation that shifts the equilibrium toward the active state. The finding that Rfz9ΔN acts as a weak constitutively active mutant could be explained by an inability to interact with LRP5/6 through Wnt, making the Axin destabilization mechanism inefficient. An important function of Wnt may be to bring Frizzled and LRP5/6 together so that β-catenin becomes sufficiently accumulated, thereby inducing TCF-dependent transcription required for the cellular activities.

https://openalex.org/W2159898367,"Hepatic myofibroblasts (hMFs) are central in the development of liver fibrosis during chronic liver diseases, and their removal by apoptosis contributes to the resolution of liver fibrosis. We previously identified Edg receptors for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in human hMFs. Here, we investigated the effects of S1P on hMF apoptosis. S1P reduced viability of serum-deprived hMFs by an apoptotic process that was unrelated to the conversion of S1P into sphingosine and ceramide. The apoptotic effects of S1P were receptor-independent because dihydro-S1P, an Edg agonist, had no effect. S1P also stimulated a receptor-dependent survival pathway, revealed by enhanced activation of caspase-3 by S1P in the presence of pertussis toxin. Cell survival relied on two pertussis toxin-sensitive events, activation of ERK and activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt by S1P. Both pathways were also activated by dihydro-S1P. Blunting either ERK or PI3K enhanced caspase-3 stimulation by S1P, and simultaneous inhibition of both pathways resulted in additive effects on caspase-3 activation. In conclusion, S1P induces apoptosis of human hMFs via a receptor-independent mechanism and stimulates a survival pathway following activation of Edg receptors. The survival pathway arises from the sequential activation of G(i)/G(o) proteins and independent stimulations of ERK and PI3K/Akt. Therefore, blocking Edg receptors may sensitize hepatic myofibroblasts to apoptosis by S1P."
https://openalex.org/W1993257271,"Previous work has suggested that increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E at Ser-209 in the C-terminal loop of the protein often correlates with increased translation rates. However, the functional consequences of phosphorylation have remained contentious with our understanding of the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in translational control far from complete. To investigate the role for eIF4E phosphorylation in de novo translation, we studied the recovery of human kidney cells from hypertonic stress. Results show that hypertonic shock caused a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis and the disaggregation of polysomes. These changes were associated with the dephosphorylation of eIF4G, eIF4E, 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and ribosomal protein S6. In addition, decreased levels of the eIF4F complex and increased association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E were observed over a similar time course. The return of cells to isotonic medium rapidly promoted the phosphorylation of these initiation factors, increased levels of eIF4F complexes, promoted polysome assembly, and increased rates of translation. However, by using a cell-permeable, specific inhibitor of eIF4E kinase, Mnk1 (CGP57380), we show that de novoinitiation of translation and eIF4F complex assembly during this recovery phase did not require eIF4E phosphorylation.

The presence of this cap structure has a strong stimulatory effect on the translation of mRNA, facilitating the recruitment of translation initiation factors (eIFs)1 to allow ribosome binding and initiation at the correct start site (for review, see Refs.1Rhoads R.E.

It also forms a complex with the scaffold protein eIF4G (8Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M.

Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar). While phosphorylation of eIF4E has been reported to increase its interaction with the cap structure (34Minich W.B. Balasta M.L. Goss D.J. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7668-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), recent studies have suggested that our understanding of the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in translational control is far from complete (5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar). First, increased phosphorylation of eIF4E observed during cell stress is sometimes associated with a global inhibition of protein synthesis (5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar, 21Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of eIF4E is not required for restoration of translation in an eIF4E-dependent systemin vitro, and both wild-type and phosphorylation site variants are able to rescue the lethal phenotype of eIF4E deletion inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (35McKendrick L. Morley S.J. Pain V.M. Jagus R. Joshi B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also it appears that phosphorylation of eIF4E is not a prerequisite for mitogen-induced cap-dependent translation in cultured cells (28Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in adult cardiocytes, eIF4E phosphorylation had no effect on eIF4F complex formation or total rates of protein synthesis (36Saghir A.N. Tuxworth W.J. Hagedorn C.H. McDermott P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, eIF4E phosphorylation does appear to be important for cell growth in Drosophila; transgenic Drosophilaexpressing a non-phosphorylatable form of eIF4E in a null background show reduced viability, smaller cell size, and developmental delays (37Lachance P.E.D. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Despite this, no strong phenotype was observed by expressing a form of eIF4E that mimicked eIF4E phosphorylation (37Lachance P.E.D. Miron M. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Lasko P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1656-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Biophysical studies by Scheper et al. (33Scheper G.C. van Kollenberg B., Hu, J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that phosphorylation of eIF4E actually reduces its binding to mRNA caps by promoting its rate of dissociation. These data are consistent with an earlier prediction (19Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar) that, with analogy to the transcriptional machinery, phosphorylation may be required for the release of eIF4F from the cap complex during the initiation process (33Scheper G.C. van Kollenberg B., Hu, J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Alternatively, phosphorylation of eIF4E may be involved in reprogramming (de novo) translation by promoting the rate of release of factors from existing initiation complexes to give under-represented mRNAs a chance to compete for ribosome binding (5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation.

Exposure of mammalian cells to hypertonic stress is a very effective means of inducing a transient fall in protein synthesis, which is rapidly reversible upon restoration of isotonic medium (38Saborio J.L. Pong S.S. Koch G. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 85: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 39Kruppa J. Clemens M.J.

This system has been used as a tool to study the function of the eIF4F complex during de novo recruitment of mRNA in intact cells (41Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study we used hypertonic stress to investigate the role for eIF4E phosphorylation in de novo translation using a cell-permeable inhibitor of Mnk, CGP57380 (28Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), to prevent the rephosphorylation of eIF4E during recovery from such stress. Materials for tissue culture were from Invitrogen, and fetal calf serum was from Labtech International. [35S]Methionine was from ICN, and phosphospecific antisera to eIF4E (Ser-209, catalog no. 9741), eIF4G (Ser-1108, catalog no. 2441), p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182, catalog no. 9211), 4E-BP1 (Ser-65, catalog no. 9451), and ribosomal protein S6 (Thr-421/Ser-424, catalog no. 9204) were fromCell Signaling Technology. Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride was from Millipore, and m7GTP-Sepharose was from AmershamBiosciences. CGP57380, a specific, cell-permeable inhibitor of Mnk1 (28Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. Hermann Gram, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were from Sigma. Human 293 kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. When used, CGP57380 or Me2SO alone was added to cultures and was present in all subsequent incubations as indicated. Cells were cultured in six-well plates, and [35S]methionine was added to the complete growth medium at the specific activity and for the times indicated in the individual figure legends. Cells were harvested, and the incorporation of methionine into protein was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (22Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Following treatment, cells were scraped into PBS containing 40 mm β-glycerophosphate and 2 mm benzamidine and isolated in a cooled microfuge. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (50 mm Mops-KOH, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 80 mm KCl, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm GTP, 2 mmNa3VO4) and lysed by the addition of 0.5% (by volume) each of Igepal and deoxycholate and vortexing. Cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatants were frozen in liquid N2. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed as described previously (21Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Antiserum specific for the C-terminal domain of eIF4GI and those specific to eIF4E, eIF2α, and phospho-eIF2α were as described previously (22Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); total levels of eIF4G, eIF4E, eIF2α, PABP, eIF4A, and 4E-BP1 were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, while the determinations using commercial phosphospecific antisera and those for p38 MAP kinase used enhanced chemiluminescence for detection. In all cases, care was taken to ensure that detection was within the linear range of the response. One-dimensional vertical isoelectric focusing gels used for the analysis of eIF4E phosphorylation were performed as described previously (21Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). eIF4E and associated proteins were isolated by m7GTP-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (21Morley S.J. McKendrick L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17887-17893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Fraser C.S. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and recovered proteins were visualized by immunoblotting. Cells were isolated as described above and lysed by vortexing in 200 μl of Buffer B (200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 40 mm sodium fluoride, 80 mmKCl, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% (by volume) Igepal and deoxycholate). Extracts were fractionated on 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradients in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 for 75 min at 42,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C and visualized with an ISCO UA6 fractionator. In general, previous work has suggested that increased phosphorylation of eIF4E at Ser-209 in the C-terminal loop of the protein correlates with increased translation rates (1Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation.

Rep. 1994; 19: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These studies have prompted the view that eIF4E phosphorylation may have a role in modulating the cap binding activity of the protein, invoking elaborate models based on biochemical studies and three-dimensional structure analysis (2Gingras A-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 6Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Cell. 1997; 89: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Tomoo K. Shen X. Okabe K. Nozoe Y. Fukuhara S. Morino S. Ishida T. Taniguchi T. Hasegawa H. Terashima A. Sasaki M. Katsuya Y. Kitamura K. Miyoshi H. Ishikawa M. Miura K.-I. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences of phosphorylation have remained elusive, and several exceptions have called into question the correlation with global rates of protein synthesis (for review, see Ref. 5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation of eIF4E, rather than modulating global protein synthesis, may be involved in reprogramming translation (5Morley S.J. Rhoads R.E. Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar, 19Morley S.J. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 197-224Google Scholar), possibly by promoting the rate of release of factors from existing initiation complexes to give under-represented mRNAs a chance to compete for the 40 S ribosome (33Scheper G.C. van Kollenberg B., Hu, J. Luo Y. Goss D.J. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3303-3309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism could resolve apparently conflicting observations of increased phosphorylation of eIF4E following either mitogenic stimulation or the application of cell stress. Recently a novel, non-toxic, specific inhibitor of Mnk1 (CGP57380) has been described that prevents eIF4E phosphorylation in response to mitogens (28Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In our study we have used CGP57380 to investigate the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in de novo initiation of translation and eIF4F complex assembly. Fig.1A shows that CGP57380 had no significant effect on the serum-stimulated up-regulation of translation rates in starved 293 cells. In addition, SDS-PAGE analysis of initiation factors shows that CGP57380 did not affect the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of eIF4G (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 6 versus lanes 5 and10; quantified in Fig. 1C). However, although eIF4E phosphorylation was normally increased in response to serum (Fig.1B, lane 1 versus 6), consistent with published data (28Knauf U. Tschopp C. Gram H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5500-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), both the basal level and the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of eIF4E were reduced by CGP57380 at concentrations greater than 10–15 μm. Isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting for eIF4E confirmed the dephosphorylation of eIF4E in response to CGP57380 (Fig. 1B); quantification of these data is shown in Fig. 1C. Fig. 1Dshows that although CGP57380 could reduce eIF4F levels to a small extent in starved cells (lane 4 versus lane 1), treatment of cells with up to 20 μm CGP57380 had no effect on the serum-stimulated recovery of eIF4G, PABP, or eIF4A associated with eIF4E (lane 8 versus lane 4). This finding is consistent with the observation that association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was unaffected by CGP57380 treatment alone (data not shown). To determine conditions for the investigation of the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in de novo initiation events, human kidney cells were incubated in the presence of NaCl in excess to that already present in the growth medium. Fig. 2shows that 50–200 mm added NaCl resulted in a concentration- (A) and time-dependent (B) inhibition of protein synthesis. To address whether hypertonic shock is associated with changes in the phosphorylation status of key initiation factors, extracts were prepared, and proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antisera. Fig.2C shows that dephosphorylation of a key phosphorylation site in 4E-BP1 (Ser-65) was complete within 15 min, while that of eIF4G (Ser-1108, Refs. 3Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Sonenberg N.

Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar and 29Waskiewicz A.J. Johnson J.C. Penn B. Mahalingam M. Kimball S.R. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1871-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, and see Fig. 2D). However, isoelectric focusing of eIF4E showed that salt treatment for 60 min was required to reduce levels of the phosphorylated protein below 5% (Fig. 2B). In agreement with published data for HeLa cells (40Duncan R.F Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1293-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), over the times used in this study there was little change in the phosphorylation status of eIF2α in response to hypertonic stress (Fig. 2C). We also investigated the effects of hypertonic shock on the eIF4F complex. Isolation of eIF4E and associated factors with m7GTP-Sepharose (Fig. 2E) indicated that hypertonic shock caused a dissociation of eIF4G, PABP, and eIF4A from eIF4E, indicative of a decrease in eIF4F complex levels. As predicted from accepted models (2Gingras A-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 3Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N.

Signaling Pathways for Translation. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2001: 1-37Google Scholar), the dissociation of eIF4G from eIF4E occurred concomitantly with an increase in binding of the less phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E. Using the conditions determined above, we investigated the requirement for eIF4E phosphorylation in de novo protein synthesis following recovery from hypertonic shock, a process requiring the integrity of the eIF4F complex (41Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with 200 mmNaCl for 60 min resulted in an inhibition of the rate of protein synthesis (Fig. 3A) and disaggregation of polysomes (Fig. 3B). Together these events are characteristic of a defect in the initiation stage of translation, a finding confirmed by the observation that polysomes were stabilized by the inclusion of cycloheximide in the medium during salt treatment (data not shown). On return to isotonic medium, protein synthesis rates recovered to control levels within 30–45 min (Fig. 3A) and polysomes reformed (Fig. 3B). In the presence of 20 μm CGP57380, polysomes reformed on return to isotonic conditions, but there was a distinct shift toward smaller polysomes, suggesting that eIF4E phosphorylation may have a subtle role in the initiation of translation. Further work will be required to address this possibility. Consistent with the data presented in Fig. 2, hypertonic shock for 60 min caused a decrease in the phosphorylation of eIF4G, eIF4E, 4E-BP1, and S6, an increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig.2C, lane 2 versus lane 1), and a decrease in the recovery of eIF4G associated with eIF4E. Conversely, there was an increase in association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E following salt stress (Fig. 2D, lane 2 versus lane 1). Return of the cells to isotonic medium promoted a time-dependent phosphorylation of total eIF4G, which occurred with similar kinetics in the absence or presence of CGP57380 (Fig. 3C). Similarly, recovery was also associated with phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Ser-65 as visualized with the phosphospecific antiserum and a characteristic mobility shift of the total 4E-BP1 on SDS-PAGE using antiserum that recognizes the protein irrespective of its phosphorylation status (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, these events and the dephosphorylation (and inactivation) of p38 MAP kinase were seen to occur with essentially the same kinetics in the absence (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–6) or presence of CGP57380 (lanes 9–12). In contrast, although the phosphorylation of total eIF4E increased from very low levels in the absence of inhibitor on return to isotonic conditions (Fig.3C, lanes 3–6), CGP57380 completely prevented this increase (lanes 9–12). These data were confirmed with isoelectric focusing/immunoblotting analysis of eIF4E (data not shown) and were not due to changes in the levels of eIF4E recovered in the extracts (Figs. 3C). The phosphorylation of S6 lagged behind that of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 and the increase in the rate of protein synthesis during the recovery period. These data are in agreement with previous findings with MPC11 cells in showing that changes in S6 phosphorylation are too slow to account for rapid changes in protein synthesis following tonicity shifts (39Kruppa J. Clemens M.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We also examined the phosphorylation status of the eIF4F complex during recovery from salt stress. Following the return of cells to isotonic conditions, the assembly of the eIF4F complex occurred rapidly both in the absence and presence of CGP57380. In each instance, this was associated with the release of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E and enhanced binding of eIF4G to eIF4E (Fig. 3D). The increase in levels of eIF4F complex was confirmed by the finding that there was enhanced association of PABP and eIF4A with eIF4E under such conditions (data not shown). The phosphorylation of the population of eIF4G recovered in the eIF4F complex also increased with similar kinetics to that observed for the total eIF4G in the absence or presence of CGP57380 (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the phosphorylation of eIF4E was completely prevented by the presence of CGP57380 during the recovery period (Fig. 3D, lanes 9–12). Therefore, although the integrity of eIF4G is critical for the reprogramming (de novo) translation during recovery of cells from hypertonic stress (41Novoa I. Carrasco L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2445-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), eIF4E phosphorylation was not a prerequisite for increased rates of de novo translation or enhanced levels of eIF4F complexes. Further work will be needed to resolve the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in growth control in cultured cells. CGP57380, a specific, cell-permeable inhibitor of Mnk1, was a kind gift from Dr. Hermann Gram, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel."

MAPKs are activated by a wide range of diverse stimuli and are essential for various cellular processes, such as stress responses, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and early embryonic development (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

The prototypical MAPK signaling cascade is a three-kinase module, consisting of MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K), and MAPK (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The upstream molecules that link the MAPK module to extracellular stimuli include small G proteins and a group of mammalian Ste20-like kinases, including hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), germinal center kinase (GCK), HKP1/germinal center kinase-like kinase, germinal center kinase-like kinase (GLK), and kinase homologous to Ste20 (KHS), which have been characterized as potential MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) for the JNK pathway (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Within the three-kinase module, MAPKs are phosphorylated on both threonine and tyrosine residues within their signature sequence TXY motif by a dual specificity protein kinase MAP2K. These motifs include TEY in ERK, TPY in JNK, and TGY in p38. MAP2K are activated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues by MAP3Ks (1Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar, 2Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In the case of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of the TEY motif also contributes to the dimerization and nuclear translocation of ERK1/2 in addition to mediating its activation (6Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The extracellular stimuli-induced activation of MAPKs is transient under many conditions, and it has been well established that protein phosphatases play an essential role in the down-regulation of MAP kinases. A variety of classes of protein phosphatases, including tyrosine-specific protein phosphatases, serine/threonine protein phosphatases, and a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases (DSPs), have been implicated in the negative regulation of MAPKs (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 8Keyse S.M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Among them, DSPs are the major group of phosphatases that contribute to the regulated inactivation of MAP kinases by dephosphorylating both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues within the TXY motif, thus also called MAP kinase phosphatases (MKPs) (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 8Keyse S.M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Most MKPs identified so far consist of a conserved catalytic region and an extended regulatory region. However, some MKPs lack this regulatory region, such as VH1 (10Guan K.L. Bryoles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and VH1-related (VHR) phosphatase (11Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A.C. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The regulatory region of MKPs is responsible for substrate binding and thus makes MKPs display varying degrees of specificity for inactivating different MAP kinases. For example, MKP-3/PYST1 completely inactivates ERK1 and ERK2 but not JNK and p38 MAP kinases (12Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.C. Martinou I. Camps M. Schlegel W. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

In addition to the phosphorylation that is necessary for kinase activation, the kinases within the MAPK cascade are also subject to negative regulation by phosphorylation. It has been well documented that phosphorylation of Ser-259 and Ser-261 on Raf, a MAP3K kinase for the ERK pathway, prevents the activation of Raf-1 (16Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1), a MAP3K that stimulates JNK and p38 signaling pathways, is subject to negative regulation by AKT-mediated phosphorylation (19Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). AKT-mediated phosphorylation of stress-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase 1 (SEK1) on Ser-78 inhibits its activation and prevents its interaction with JNK, thereby suppressing the SEK1-mediated JNK signaling pathway (20Park H.-S. Kim M.-S. Huh S.-H. Park J. Chung J. Kang S.S. Choi E.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 2573-2578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) directly phosphorylates JNK3 on Thr-131 and inhibits its kinase activity and leads to reduced c-Jun phosphorylation (21Li B.-S. Zhang L. Takahashi S., Ma, W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that some protein phosphatases are involved in positive regulation of MAPKs by dephosphorylating those inhibitory phosphorylated residues. It has been shown that the Shp-2 tyrosine phosphatase is necessary for ERK activation by a number of growth factors including insulin growth factor-1, platelet-derived growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (22Shi Z.Q., Lu, W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A acts as a positive regulator for Raf-1 (17Abraham D. Podar K. Pacher M. Kubicek M. Welzel N. Hemmings B.A. Dilworth S.M. Mischak H. Kolch W. Baccarini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22300-22304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that protein phosphatase 4 (PP4), another serine/threonine phosphatase, is positively involved in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced activation of the JNK pathway (23Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. VanHooser A., Hu, M.C.-T. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, the MAPK activity is determined by the combined influences of kinases and phosphatases, and both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play essential roles in controlling the duration and magnitude of MAPK activity depending on the cell type and stimuli. As the relationship between DSPs and MAPK is studied, the complexity of kinase regulation increases. For example, overexpression of MKP1, which inactivates ERK, activates the ERK-upstream kinases MKK1, MKK2, and Raf-1 (24Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MKP-1 itself is controlled by ERK, which induces both MKP-1 stability and activity (25Brondello J.-M.

Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In an effort to isolate transcripts differentially up-regulated in murine hematopoietic stem cells, we identified a dual specificity phosphatase, called the JNK pathway-associated phosphatase (JKAP), that specifically activates the JNK pathway and is required for the cytokine-induced JNK activation. Moreover, Jkap deficiency in murine bone marrow progenitor cells resulted in loss of sensitivity of the cells to inhibition of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-induced colony-forming cells (CFCs).

Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding β-galactosidase (0.15 μg) in combination with an empty vector or various amounts of plasmids encoding phosphatases, phosphatase mutants, kinases, or kinase mutants as indicated in the figure legends. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as described previously (29Wang W. Zhou G., Hu, M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphatase activities of Myc-JKAP and Myc-JKAP-C88S were assayed at 30 °C usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate.

The immunoprecipitants were then incubated with 1 ml of 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) with 10 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm pNPP for 1 h at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.1n NaOH, and the hydrolyzed pNPP was quantified by measurement of spectrophotometric absorbance at 410 nm.

The presence or absence of a M. spretus-specific 12.5-kb BglII fragment, detected by a probe corresponding to nucleotide positions 2251–2566 of the Jkap cDNA, was followed in backcross progeny. A total of 205 N2 mice were used to map the Jkaplocus. Recombination distances were calculated using Map Manager, version 2.6.5. An 851-bpEaeI fragment from the Jkap cDNA, consisting of the coding region and 200 bp of 3′-untranslated region, was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega), linearized at theNotI site, generating pCI-JKAP. The mutant pCI-JKAP-C88S was generated by PCR mutagenesis with pCI-JKAP, using mutagenic primers covering the site (cysteine 88) of the amino acid change, a 5′ amplification primer in the vector backbone, and a 3′ amplification primer in the 3′-untranslated region. To generate the plasmid backbone, pNeoUSEFUL, the 1.35-kb XhoI fragment (neo) of pPol2Sneo (provided by P. Soriano) was blunted, cloned into theEcoRV site of pBluescript-SK(−), reisolated withBamHI and SalI, and finally cloned into pUSEFUL (provided by A. Bradley) cut with BamHI and SalI (releasing pGK-hprt and leaving thymidine kinase and unique cloning sites intact). The 3′ arm, a subcloned 2.8-kbSalI-XbaI fragment consisting of Jkapgenomic and cDNA sequence immediately after the second targeted exon, was then blunted and cloned into the BamHI site, also blunted, of pNeoUSEFUL, generating clone B2.8-8-1. The 5′ arm, a subcloned 5.0-kb XbaI fragment consisting of genomicJkap sequence immediately before the first targeted exon, was cloned into intermediate plasmid CXS (pSAβgeo, provided by P. Soriano; cut with HindIII and XbaI, blunted, and recircularized), cut with XbaI. The fragment was reisolated with ClaI and SalI and cloned into B2.8-8-1 cut with ClaI and SalI, generating clone B8/4-1, the targeting vector. Targeted ES cell clones were generated essentially as described (33Bradley A. Robertson E.J. Teratocarinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 113-152Google Scholar). Briefly, a targeting vector was designed that deletes the two coding exons of JKAP, which encode the catalytic domain of the phosphatase. The vector was constructed using DNA from a murine 129/SV/EV total genomic DNA library. This vector was electroporated into AB2.2 ES cells derived from 129/SV/EV mice. Resulting clones were screened by Southern blot analysis for evidence of homologous recombination. Several independent targeted clones were obtained. Homozygous JKAP−/− ES clones were obtained by superselection in 1.5 mg/ml G418 and confirmed by Southern blotting. Jkap −/− animals were derived by breeding Jkap +/− ES cell chimeras with wild-type 129SvEvBrd female animals. Because the AB2.2. ES line was derived from the same strain of the 129SvEvBrd female animals, the resulting animals were inbred with respect to all background loci.Jkap −/− animals were born in expected Mendelian ratios (data not shown) and remained overtly healthy through adult life. Early passage (passages 3–6) MEF derived from embryonic day 12.5Jkap-1 −/− embryos were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. 2 × 104 cells were plated, transferred into each well of a 24-well tissue culture dish. After 24 h, triplicate cultures were treated with variable amounts of TGF-β1 (R & D Systems) diluted in 4 mm HCl or with diluant only (controls). Cells were then pulsed with 4 mCi of [3H]thymidine for 12 h. The percentage decrease in thymidine incorporation in the TGF-treated samples relative to the untreated controls was scored in six independent experiments. Bone marrow cells were collected from tibias and femurs of 6–8-week-old Jkap-1−/− and Jkap-1+/+ littermate controls. Mononucleated cells were isolated by buoyant gradient centrifugation (Histopaque; Sigma). Mononucleated cells (104 cells/ml) were plated in semisolid media (Methocult; StemCell Technologies) containing 1% methyl-cellose in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 10−4m 2-mercaptoethanol, l-glutamine, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml bovine pancreatic insulin, 200 μg/ml human transferrin, 50 ng/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 10 ng/ml interleukin-6, and 3 units/ml erythropoietin. Cultures in duplicate to quadruplicate were done with or without various concentrations of TGF-β in a 37 °C 5% CO2 humidified chamber. At day 10, the total number of colonies was scored. The TGF-β activity was measured by the percentage of inhibition observed in treated cultures relative to their respective untreated controls. GST and GST-JNK fusion protein were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated in incubation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates (600 μg) from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with Myc-JKAP or Myc-M3/6 were incubated with GST-JNK fusion protein or GST-4T-Sepharose beads in incubation buffer containing 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed five times with the incubation buffer, boiled in an SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 5 min, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and then subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Myc antibody. The membrane was then stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) and reprobed with an anti-GST antibody. In an effort to isolate transcripts differentially up-regulated in murine hematopoietic stem cells by employing differential display PCR, we identified the Jkap transcript, among others, as being expressed preferentially in the stem cell-enriched Lin−Sca-1+ population of murine bone marrow cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, compared with the Lin−Sca-1− population, which is deficient in pluripotent stem cell activity. Lin−(i.e. lineage negative) refers to the absence of cell surface expression of CD4, CD8, B220, Mac-1, GR-1, and Ter115, which are expressed upon commitment to helper T cell, killer T cell, B cell, macrophage, granulocyte, and erythrocyte lineages, respectively. Sca-1+ or Sca-1− refers the presence or absence of cell surface expression of stem cellantigen 1 encoded by Ly6A2. A full-length murineJkap cDNA consisting of 3012 bp was obtained by screening an adult muscle cDNA library. This cDNA contained a 700-bp open reading frame with similarity to a subgroup of protein phosphatases, dual specificity phosphatases, that have activities in the MAPK pathways (Fig. 1 A). The human orthologue of Jkap was subsequently identified. The inferred murine and human JKAP amino acid sequences are 89% identical (Fig. 1 A). The predicted JKAP protein contains the catalytic C-terminal domain of dual specificity phosphatases but lacks an N-terminal noncatalytic domain and is consequently ∼100 amino acid shorter than most other MAPK phosphatases. All residues of the signature motif I/VHCXXGXSRS of dual specificity phosphatases (34Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 35Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) are conserved in the JKAP protein (Fig. 1,A and B). Within the phosphatase catalytic domain, JKAP displayed 31–39% amino acid identity to other MKPs (Fig.1 C). A phylogenetic comparison of MAPK DUSP was carried out using a recently described method that employs Baysian inference to assess the reliability of the resulting tree. This analysis suggests that JKAP is a mouse orthologue of recently described human DSP, JNK-stimulatory phosphatase 1 (JSP-1) (36Shen Y. Luche R. Wei B. Gordon M.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13613-13618Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and that JKAP/JSP-1 is distinctive in its catalytic motif, with the relationship to human VHR moderately supported (clade credibility 77%) (Fig.1 D). By interspecific mouse backcross analysis,Jkap mapped to the proximal region of mouse chromosome 13.Jkap is linked to Btn, Fim1, andEdn1, with the following recombination frequencies, expressed as genetic distances in centimorgans ± S.E.: centromere–Btn–1.3 ± 0.9–Fim1–3.5 ± 1.4–Jkap–8.6 ± 2.1–Edn1. The human orthologue of Jkap was subsequently identified, and the inferred map position in chromosome 6p (based on the current human genome sequence assembly available in the public data base) is consistent with known mouse and human synteny. The expression pattern of JKAP mRNA in mouse tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis using mouse JKAP cDNA probe. As shown in Fig.2, two mRNA species of 3.0 and 1.3 kb were detected. The longer 3.0-kb transcript was abundantly expressed in the heart, brain, liver, and kidney but expressed at low levels in the testis and skeletal muscle. The shorter 1.3-kb transcript was abundantly expressed in the testis and liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney and heart. Neither 3.0-kb transcript nor 1.3-kb transcript was detected in the spleen. The broad expression of JKAP implies that JKAP functions in a wide range of tissues in the adult mouse. The differential expression patterns of the 3.0- and 1.3-kb transcripts (e.g. only the 3.0-kb transcript in the brain and the 1.3-kb transcript in the testis) indicate a tissue-specific splicing or processing of JKAP mRNA. To further characterize the expression pattern ofJkap in murine tissues, we isolated Lin−Sca-1+ and Lin−Sca-1− cells from adult murine bone marrow by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and performed in situ hybridization analysis with a Jkap antisense riboprobe. As expected, we confirmed that Jkap is preferentially expressed in Lin−Sca-1+ cells, as compared with Lin−Sca-1− cells (Fig.3, A and B), suggesting a role for JKAP in hematopoietic precursor cells. Whole-mount in situ hybridization of embryonic day 10.5 mouse embryos detected the highest levels of Jkaptranscripts in the somites and branchial arches (Fig. 3,C–E). No expression was observed in the embryonic dorsal aorta, a region identified as a site of definitive hematopoiesis in chick, Xenopus, mouse, and human embryos at similar developmental stages (37Jaffredo T. Gautier R. Eichmann A. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Development. 1998; 125: 4575-4583PubMed Google Scholar, 38Labastie M. Cortes F. Romeo P. Dulac C. Peault B. Blood. 1998; 92: 3624-3635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the earliest intraembryonic hematopoietic cells do not express Jkap at a high level (Fig. 3 F). Given the close sequence similarity of JKAP to MKPs, we sought to determine the effects of JKAP on JNK, p38, and ERK2. To our surprise, overexpressed JKAP had no inhibitory effect on the activity of either TGF-β-activated kinase 1-activated JNK1, MKK6-activated p38, or protein kinase C-ι-activated ERK2 (data not shown). Instead, we found that JKAP had the ability to activate JNK1 (Fig.4). We cotransfected HA-JNK1 into HEK293T cells with wild-type JKAP or a catalytic site mutant of JKAP, JKAP-C88S. In JKAP-C88S, the Cys → Ser substitution allows the phosphatase to be isolated in a complex with its target substrate due to failure of cleavage of the scissile bond and, therefore, results in the loss of its phosphatase activity as indicated by hydrolyzingpNPP, a chromogenic substrate (Fig. 4 A,lower panel). HA-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and its activity was determined"

Depending on the growth conditions, β-1,2-oligomannosides are associated with different carrier molecules in the cell wall.

Along with their role in membrane permeability and fluidity, they have also been shown to act as second messengers produced in response to various stress situations, which regulate basic processes such as cell cycle control, apoptosis (4Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), cell-cell interactions (1Hakomori S.

Acta. 1996; 1301: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Sphingolipids are ceramide structures composed of a long chain base whose amino group is amide-linked to various fatty acids. This basic structure as well as those derived by the addition of polar groups such as phosphocholine or carbohydrates to the ceramide may vary according to the species (6Merrill A.H. Sweeley C.C. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 309-339Google Scholar, 7Jennemann R. Geyer R. Sandhoff R. Gschwind R.M.

Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It has been established that sphingolipids from fungal and mammalian cells display important differences in their fine structure and biosynthetic pathways (9Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Fungal species incorporate phytosphingosine (PHS)1 and presumably dihydrosphingosine in the ceramide moieties instead of the sphingosine used mainly by mammals and also have longer fatty acids (C24-C26 instead of C16-C18) (9Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Fungi then preferentially add inositol to the ceramide group, leading to the family of inositol phosphoceramides composed of inositol phosphoceramide (IPC), mannose inositol phosphoceramide (MIPC), and mannose diinositol phosphoceramide (M(IP)2C) instead of phosphocholine in mammalian cells (9Dickson R.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These differences between mammalian cells and fungi represent a target for antifungal drugs such as aureobasidin A (10Zhong W. Jeffries M.W. Georgopapadakou N.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and khafrefungin (11Mandala S.M. Thornton R.A. Rosenbach M. Milligan J. Garcia-Calvo M. Bull H.G. Kurtz M.B. J. Biol.

Along with sphingomyelin of mammals and IPCs of fungi and plants, glycosylceramides are another important class of sphingolipids described in fungi and mammals in which the sugar moiety is directly linked to the ceramide (6Merrill A.H. Sweeley C.C. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 309-339Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway of fungal sphingolipids has only been studied in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Numerous steps in the pathway are still unknown (12Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and the enzymes involved have not yet been purified or characterized. This lack of knowledge contrasts with the key role of these molecules in cell growth (13Chung N. Mao C. Heitman J. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol.

Although Candida albicans is the prominent opportunistic fungal pathogen causing mucocutaneous and systemic infections (18Beck-Sague C. Jarvis W.R. J. Infect.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6223-6226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a series of studies, some immunochemical properties of a C. albicans glycolipid containing long chains of β-1,2-linked mannose residues have been demonstrated and characterized previously (22Trinel P.A.

C. albicansβ-1,2-oligomannosides, which act as adhesins (23Li R.K. Cutler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18293-18299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fradin C. Poulain D. Jouault T.

Immun. 1997; 65: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are considered to be among the virulence factors of this species. Using a model of C. albicans macrophage interaction, it was shown that phospholipomannan (PLM) shed by C. albicans acted as a vector for β-1,2-oligomannosides in inducing strong cellular stimulation (27Jouault T. Fradin C. Trinel P.A. Bernigaud A. Poulain D. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 792-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the complete structure of this pathophysiologically relevant molecule of C. albicans. A purification procedure was developed to obtain large quantities of soluble PLM, and phase gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of methanolysis products, extensive NMR, and MS analyses were carried out. A combination of the results of these analyses allowed the complete structure of PLM to be determined and demonstrated that PLM is a new type of mannose inositol phosphoceramide. C. albicansserotype A, strain VW32, was used throughout this study. For large scale cell production, cells were preincubated on Sabouraud's agar for 18 h at 28 or 37 °C and then inoculated at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 500 ml of Sabouraud's broth. Growth was performed to stationary phase at 28 or 37 °C on an orbital shaker (180 rpm). Cells were finally collected by centrifugation. Cells were broken with a French press (Aminco) at 20,000 p.s.i, dialyzed, and lyophilized. PLM was then extracted and purified as described previously (22Trinel P.A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Schwarz R.T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30520-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with the exception that care was taken to avoid micelle formation to improve PLM solubility for NMR studies. Modifications to the method were mainly the lyophilization of most water phases or fractions instead of centrifuge concentration and the reduced use of highly concentrated water phases. The main steps in PLM purification were as follows: (i) extraction with various chloroform/methanol and chloroform/methanol/water mixtures; (ii) extensive butanol/water partitions; and (iii) hydrophobic interaction on phenyl-Sepharose using increasing concentrations of ethanol (1–40%) for elution. Purification and control of PLM fractions were followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) (22Trinel P.A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Schwarz R.T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30520-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Western blot analysis using the mouse IgM monoclonal antibody, DF9-3 (28Trinel P.A. Borg-von-Zepelin M. Lepage G. Jouault T. Mackenzie D. Poulain D. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4398-4405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (1–5 μg) of purified PLM were lyophilized in conical heavy walled Pyrex tubes (2.0 ml) with Teflon lined screw caps. Methanolysis reagent (0.25–0.5 ml) was then added, and the closed vessels were left for 20 h at 80 °C. The methanolysis reagent was obtained by dissolving anhydrous gaseous HCl (up to 0.5 m) at −50 °C in anhydrous methanol previously redistilled on magnesium turnings (29Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Gaseous HCl was prepared by the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid onto crystallized sodium chloride. After methanolysis, samples were evaporated to dryness under a light stream of nitrogen in a ventilated hood followed by the addition of 200 μl of acetonitrile and 25 μl of heptafluorobutyric anhydride with a pipette with plastic tips. The closed vessels were heated for 15 min at 150 °C in a sand bath. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were evaporated in a light stream of nitrogen in a ventilated hood to eliminate excess reagent, and samples were then submitted to a further methanolysis followed by acylation with heptafluorobutyric anhydride as described above. This second methanolysis and acylation step was found necessary for complete cleavage of phosphodiester bonds (and when present, of the linkage between glucosamine and inositol which is observed in glycosylphosphatidylinositols). After drying, the sample was taken up in 200 μl of acetonitrile previously dried on calcinated calcium chloride, and an aliquot was introduced into the Ross injector of the GC apparatus. For GC/MS analysis, the GC separation was performed on a Carlo Erba GC 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25-m × 0.32-mm CP-Sil5 CB Low Bleed/MS capillary column 0.25-μm film phase (Chrompack France, Les Ullis, France). The temperature of the Ross injector was 260 °C, and the samples were analyzed using the following temperature program: 90 °C for 3 min and then 5 °C/min until reaching 240 °C. The column was coupled to a Finnigan Automass II mass spectrometer. The analyses were performed in the electron impact mode (ionization energy 70 eV, source temperature 150 °C). As described previously (29Zanetta J.P. Timmerman P. Leroy Y. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Pons A. Popa J. Portoukalian J. Bodennec J. Ardail D. Kol O.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 794-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this method allowed the identification and the quantification of all constituents of glycolipids in a single GC/MS analysis. Electrospray mass measurements were carried out in negative ion mode on a triple quadrupole instrument (Micromass Ltd, Altrincham, United Kingdom) fitted with an atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray source. A mixture of polypropylene glycol was used to calibrate the quadrupole mass spectrometer. The samples were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and further diluted in methanol to obtain a final concentration of ∼1 μg/μl. Solutions were infused using a Harvard syringe pump at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The quadrupole was scanned from 600 to 2200 Da with a scan duration of 5 s and a scan delay of 0.1 s. The samples were sprayed using a 3.5-kV needle voltage, and the declustering cone was set at 70 V. Samples (PLM-28 and PLM-37) were repeatedly treated with 2H2O (99.97%2H atoms, Euriso-top, CEA, Saclay, France) and then dissolved in 250 μl of Me2SO-d 6(99.98% 2H, Euriso-top). 1H and13C chemical shifts were expressed in parts/million downfield from the signal of Me2SO-d 6 methyl group (δ1H = 2.50 and δ13C = 40.55 ppm), and 31P chemical shifts were referenced to external H3PO4 (δ = 0.00 ppm). Samples were analyzed in 200 × 5-mm BMS-005B Shigemi® tubes at 343 K on a Bruker® ASX-400 spectrometer (1H = 400.33, 13C = 100.66, and31P = 162.5 MHz) equipped with a double resonance (1H/X) broadband inverse z-gradient probe head. All NMR samples were recorded without sample spinning. The one-dimensional proton 1H spectra were measured using a 90° tipping angle for the pulse and 1.5 s as a recycle delay between each 32 acquisitions of 2.4 s. The spectral width of 4006 Hz was collected in 16,000 complex data points. One-dimensional13C was recorded using a spectral width of 20,161 Hz, and 32,768 data points were collected to obtain a field induction decay resolution of 0.6 Hz/point. The 31P spectra of both compounds were acquired with a spectral width of 16,233 Hz collected in 16,384 data points. Both experiments were carried out with composite pulse decoupling during acquisition using globally optimized alternating phase rectangular pulse sequence at the carbon or phosphorus frequency. An exponential transformation (line broadening factor = 6 Hz for 13C and 4 Hz for 31P) was applied prior to processing data points in the frequency domain. Two-dimensional homonuclear (1H-1H) COSY, one-step relayed COSY, two-step relayed COSY and ROESY, and heteronuclear 1H-13C HMQC,1H-31P HMQC, and HMQC-HOHAHA spectroscopy were carried out using standard Bruker pulse programs (cosy, cosyrl, cosyr2, roesytp, inv4tp, inv4mlevtp, respectively). All of the experiments were carried out in the time-phase proportional increment with the exception of COSYs, which were conducted in a magnitude mode. Finally, two-dimensional HMQC-HOHAHA spectroscopy was recorded using Malcom Lewitt-17 mixing sequences with a mixing time of 120 ms for both13C and 31P nuclei. Two-dimensional ROESY spectra were obtained with mixing times of 400 ms. All of the parameters including special delays were carried out in each experiment. Our GC/MS analysis of the methanolysis products of PLM allowed us to establish in a single experiment the identification and respective ratio of each PLM component (TableI). It revealed for PLMs synthesized by C. albicans strain VW32 at 28 °C (PLM-28) or 37 °C (PLM-37) an average composition of 12 or 13 mannose residues for one inositol, one long chain base and one fatty acid. The major long chain bases were identified by their electron impact spectra (Fig. 1) as the 1,3,4-trihydroxy-2-amino-15-methyl-heptadecane (ramified C18 phytosphingosine or rC18 PHS) (Fig.1 c) and 1,3,4-trihydroxy-2-amino-15-methyl-nonadecane (rC20 PHS) (Fig. 1 d). Minor components were identified as 1,3,4-trihydroxy-2-amino-octadecane and 1,3,4-trihydroxy-2-amino-eicosane (Fig. 1 e), i.e.the corresponding non-ramified PHSs. The major fatty acid (FA) was 2-hydroxy-21-methyl-tricosanoate, a ramified hydroxylated fatty acid with 24 carbon atoms (OH rC24 FA) (Fig. 1 b). Other fatty acids were the homologues with 25 and 26 carbon atoms all hydroxylated on carbon 2 and ramified in the ω(n-3) position (OH rC25 FA and OH rC26 FA, respectively). Linear fatty acids (hexadecanoate and octadecanoate) were also present at a lower level. No trace of monosaccharides other than mannose was detected. In contrast, a small peak with a typical fragmentation pattern revealed the presence of mannose-6-phosphate.Table IComparison of the composition of phospholipomannans synthesized by C. albicans VW32 at 28 and 37 °CMolar compositionFALCBComponentNo. residuesComponentTotal FAComponentTotal LCB%%Phospholipomannan (28 °C)Mannose12.07OH rC241-cr refers to a ramification of the chain in the position ω(n − 3).71.16rC18PHS1-cr refers to a ramification of the chain in the position ω(n − 3).52.81Inositol0.987OH rC254.75C18PHS2.68Fatty acid1-aSee the details of the fatty acids composition in the column Fatty Acids.0.992OH rC266.22rC20 PHS41.8LCB1-bSee the details of the long chain base composition in the column Long Chain Base.1.00C16:07.63C20PHS2.69C18:07.96C18:12.28Phospholipomannan (37 °C)Mannose13.21OH rC2470.21rC18 PHS29.13Inositol0.891OH rC259.02C18PHS2.19Fatty acid1-aSee the details of the fatty acids composition in the column Fatty Acids.0.975OH rC264.54rC20 PHS64.54LCB1-bSee the details of the long chain base composition in the column Long Chain Base.1.00C16:09.68C20PHS4.12C18:06.53Samples were submitted to two consecutive runs of methanolysis/HFBAA acylation and then analyzed by GC-MS.

The molar composition of PLM-28 and PLM-37 appeared to be similar as did their OH rC24 FA ratio (Table I). The main modifications concerned an inversion of the relative ratios of OH rC25 FA and OH rC26 FA and a marked inversion of rC18 PHS and rC20 PHS, the latter becoming the most abundant in PLM-37. Electrospray mass spectra of PLM-37 (Fig. 2 a) and PLM-28 (Fig. 2 b) demonstrated a series of groups of five peaks that covered the entire spectra. Among these groups, those spaced by an average m/z ratio of 81 were observed. These corresponded to (M − 2H)/2 molecular-related ions and consequently to the varying degrees of polymerization of the glycan chain of PLM seen in a previous study (22Trinel P.A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Schwarz R.T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30520-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conversely, the five peaks within each group arose from heterogeneity of the lipid part of PLM, because they displayed spaced m/z ratios of 7, which therefore corresponded to a mass change of 14 (one CH2 group). According to the results of GC/MS analysis of methanolysis products and to the relative ratios of their lipid components, these peaks can be attributed to the different compositions of the ceramide moiety as shown in TableII for PLM-37. This interpretation of the results was confirmed when the PLM-28 and PLM-37 spectra were compared (Figs. 2, a and b), because at 28 °C, for each degree of polymerization of the glycan chain, an inversion of the relative importance of the two main peaks of each group was observed, which arose from changes in the ceramide moiety (i.e. rC18 PHS − OH rC24 FA and rC20 PHS − OH rC24 FA). This change must be related to the inversion of the relative molar ratios of the long chain bases as revealed by methanolysis. This observation was also confirmed by inversion of the minor peaks corresponding to rC20 PHS − OH rC25 FA and rC20 PHS − OH rC26 FA in agreement with methanolysis analysis. A second family of groups of five peaks was also observed mainly in the left part of the spectra (Fig. 2, aand b), which most probably corresponded to (M − 2H + Cl)/3 molecular-related ions. These groups of peaks were spaced by an average m/z ratio of 54 (1 Man/3) and therefore also arose because of the varying degrees of polymerization of the glycan part of PLM (Table II). Peaks within each group were spaced by an average m/z ratio of 4.66, which corresponded to a mass variation of 14 arising from the lipid part (Table II). As confirmed from their respective spacing, groups of peaks from the two families regularly overlapped, leading to common groups of peaks,i.e. groups with a main peak at m/z1166.19 or 1327.51 on Fig. 2 a. This finding was also confirmed by a slight shift of the m/z values (data not shown) and from a modification of the relative ratios of the peaks within these groups explained by the heterogeneous overlapping of the families, because they vary respectively according to M/3 and M/2.Table IINegative ion ES-mass spectrometry of PLM-37Average measuredMolecular-related ionDeduced average mass valueComposition (number of residues)2-aComposition of the molecules was defined according to their mass and the results of methanolysis analysis.Mass increment in the same familyManInsPHSFAPO3Hm/z1636.68(M − 2H)/23275.371411 rC181 OH rC2421644.04(M − 2H)/23290.091411 rC181 OH rC2521650.63(M − 2H)/23303.27 (Major)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1411 rC201 OH rC242+ 161.933303.27 (Minor)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1411 rC181 OH rC2621657.80(M − 2H)/23317.611411 rC201 OH rC2521665.01(M − 2H)/23332.031411 rC201 OH rC2621731.59(M − 2H)/23465.19 (Major)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1511 rC201 OH rC2423465.19 (Minor)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1511 rC181 OH rC2621210.62(M − 2H + Cl)/33598.421611 rC181 OH rC2421215.89(M − 2H + Cl)/33614.231611 rC181 OH rC2521220.38(M − 2H + Cl)/33627.70 (Major)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1611 rC201 OH rC242+ 161.913627.70 (Minor)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1611 rC181 OH rC2621224.89(M − 2H + Cl)/33641.231611 rC201 OH rC2521274.35(M − 2H + Cl)/33789.61 (Major)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1711 rC201 OH rC2423789.61 (Minor)2-bMajor and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak.1711 rC181 OH rC262Examples of the masses and molar ratios deduced from chosen groups in each family of molecular-related ions detected2-a Composition of the molecules was defined according to their mass and the results of methanolysis analysis.2-b Major and minor refers to the relative contribution of the two components to a same peak. Open table in a new tab Examples of the masses and molar ratios deduced from chosen groups in each family of molecular-related ions detected Therefore, the two families of groups of peaks observed in the two spectra appeared to originate from the same native molecules. According to these results, PLM may contain 3–20 Man residues/molecule with PLM containing 14 Man residues being the most abundant. In both spectra, the two main peaks at m/z ∼678 and ∼1357 appeared unrelated to the PLM families and seemed to correspond to (M − 2H)/2 and (M − H) molecular-related ions from the same molecule, which according to its mass and the results of NMR analysis (see below) is probably M(IP)2C. As observed for PLM, M(IP)2C is also heterogeneous and seems to express the same variability in its ceramide moiety. Low solubility of glycolipids leads to micelle formation, which affects the relaxation time of molecules in NMR experiments. Therefore, previous NMR analysis of PLM has been restricted to water-soluble glycans released by alkaline treatment (22Trinel P.A. Plancke Y. Gerold P. Jouault T. Delplace F. Schwarz R.T. Strecker G. Poulain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30520-30526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A new PLM preparation procedure, avoiding micelle formation, and the use of Me2SO-d 6, known to improve the solubility of glycolipids, have allowed NMR studies of the native molecule. In complementation to previous analysis of the glycan part performed in D2O, this study mainly focused on the structure of the spacer that links glycans (β-1,2-oligomannosides) to the lipid moiety and resolves previous ambiguity regarding the position of the second phosphate group of PLM. NMR analyses have consisted of: (i) a series of COSY experiments to define the 1H chemical shifts in the sugar, inositol, fatty acid, and phytosphingosine units; (ii) 1H-13C and 1H-31P HMQC correlation experiments to define the 13C chemical shifts and the nature of the phosphodiester bridges; and (iii) a ROESY experiment that has established the linkage anomery of the sugar units, their sequence, and their linkage with inositol and phytosphingosine.

(2001) J. Bacteriol. 183, 6085–6094). Their products, open reading frame 11 (ORF11) and ORF12, were essential for the conversion of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) into terpentetriene (TTE) that had the same basic skeleton as terpentecin. In this study, functional analyses of these two enzymes were performed by using purified recombinant enzymes. The ORF11 product converted GGDP into a cyclized intermediate, terpentedienol diphosphate (TDP), which was then transformed into TTE by the ORF12 product. Interestingly, the ORF12 product directly catalyzed the conversion of GGDP into three olefinic compounds. Moreover, the ORF12 product utilized farnesyl diphosphate as a substrate to give three olefinic compounds, which had the same structures as those formed from GGDP with the exception of the chain lengths. These results suggested that the ORF11 product with a DXDD motif converted GGDP into TDP by a protonation-initiated cyclization and that the ORF12 product with a DDXXD motif completed the transformation of TDP to the olefin, terpentetriene by an ionization-initiated reaction followed by deprotonation. The kinetics of the ORF12 product indicated that the affinity for TDP and GGDP were higher than that of farnesyl diphosphate and that the relative activity of the reaction converting TDP into TTE was highest among the reactions using TDP, GGDP, or farnesyl diphosphate as the substrate. These results suggested that an actual reaction catalyzed by the ORF12 was the conversion of TDP into TTE in vivo. Eubacterial diterpene cyclase genes had previously been cloned from a diterpenoid antibiotic terpentecin producer (Dairi, T., Hamano, Y., Kuzuyama, T., Itoh, N., Furihata, K., and Seto, H. (2001) J.

The successive condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with dimethylallyl diphosphate gives rise to geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (FDP)1 (C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP, C20), which are usually cyclized by organism-specific cyclases to produce the parent skeletons of monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20) (1Connolly J.D.

The reaction mechanism of these cyclases, which was investigated by switching the isopentenyl diphosphate-forming pathway, one-shot labeling with perdeuterated mevalonate, and 1H NMR spectroscopy suggested that GGDP was cyclized into a clerodane skeleton through an A/B chair-boat conformation followed by a series of concerted methyl and hydride shifts to afford an intermediary carbenium ion. 2T.

The former class and the latter class of enzymes are known to possess DDXXD and DXDD motifs, which mediate substrate binding by chelation of a divalent metal ion. Considering that the Cyc1 and the Cyc2 have a DXDD motif and a DDXXD motif, respectively, the Cyc1 was suggested to convert GGDP into the intermediary carbenium ion by the protonation-initiated cyclization, and the intermediate would be transformed into terpentetriene by the ionization-initiated reaction by the Cyc2. In this study, we examined this hypothetical enzymatic reaction by using the purified recombinant enzymes. The unique property of the Cyc2, which was able to accept GGDP and FDP as substrates in addition to the intrinsic substrate, was also reported as revealed by kinetic data.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we performed functional analysis of two enzymes, Cyc1 and Cyc2, both of which are essential for the conversion of GGDP into TTE. By using the purified recombinant enzymes, we suggest that the Cyc1 and the Cyc2 would be a monomer and a homodimer, respectively, and that the Cyc1 product with a DXDD motif converts GGDP into TDP by protonation-initiated cyclization and the Cyc2 product with a DDXXD motif and then completes the transformation by ionization of 2 to an allylic carbocation followed by deprotonation to the olefin. These reactions are analogous to those catalyzed by (−)-copalyl diphosphate synthase (kaurene synthase A) (37Ait-Ali T. Swain S.M. Reid J.B. Sun T.P. Kamiya Y.

Croteau R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) recently reported a detailed assessment of the protonation-initiated cyclization reaction catalyzed by abietadiene synthase (AS), which converts GGDP into a mixture of abietadiene double bond isomers by two sequential cyclizations, protonation-initiated and ionization-initiated reactions, at separate active sites. They constructed 16 mutated enzymes in which 10 charged or aromatic residues around a DXDD motif were replaced by alanine, asparagine, or glutamate and suggested that these residues were involved in protonation-initiated reaction by kinetic properties and pH activity profiles of the enzymes. We aligned amino acid sequences of Cyc1 with those of AS to elucidate such amino acid residues responsible for protonation-initiated cyclization. However, only one amino acid (corresponding to Trp-358 of AS) with the exception of the DXDD motif is conserved. Therefore, a crystal structure of Cyc1 and a mutational analysis based on its structure will be required to elucidate a detailed reaction mechanism of Cyc1.In the protonation-initiated cyclization catalyzed by AS, Mg2+ was shown to be required for full activity of the enzyme, although a weak activity was observed in the absence of a divalent metal ion (18Peters R.J. Croteau R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of the Cyc1, no product was detected in the absence of a divalent metal ion under the conditions employed (detectable limit of the product is ∼5 μm). Therefore, to determine the absolute requirement of a divalent metal ion in the reaction catalyzed by Cyc1, another experiment with a more sensitive analytical method such as an enzyme reaction using radiolabeled substrate will be necessary.The Cyc2 reacted even with GGDP and FDP beside the intrinsic substrate TDP. Considering the structures of compounds generated from GGDP and FDP by Cyc2, it is suggested that alternative deprotonations of the carbocation of the intermediate provide a mixture of the compounds. These reactions are very similar to those of AS, which catalyzes a conversion of (+)-copalyl diphosphate into a mixture of abietadiene, levopimaradiene, and neoabietadiene by alternative deprotonations of the terminal abietanyl carbocation (19Peters R.J. Croteau R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, Peters and Croteau (19Peters R.J. Croteau R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) reported that the product profile of these three compounds varied as a function of pH and that alternative deprotonation of the abietanyl intermediate depended largely on the positioning effects of the carbocation-diphosphate anion reaction partner rather than on the pK a of multiple participating bases of the enzyme. Therefore, we examined whether the product profile of the compounds formed from GGDP or FDP by Cyc2 varied depending on the pH. After Cyc2 was incubated with GGDP or FDP at various pH with the same buffers as those used for characterization of Cyc1, the products were analyzed by HPLC. Although we could not completely separate the peaks of α-springene (compound 6) and 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadeca-1,3,6,10,14-pentaene-(E,E,E) (compound 7) by HPLC analysis, the ratio of 1,3-(20),6,10,14-phytapentaene (compound 5) to the sum of compounds 6 and 7 did not significantly vary at pH 7.0–9.0 with various buffers. Moreover, the following fact also supports that alternative deprotonation of GGDP is caused by the positioning effect of the carbocation. If alternative deprotonation of GGDP depended on the pK a of multiple participating bases of the Cyc2, TTE formed from TDP is expected to be a mixture of a compound with a C–C double bond at C-13 and C-16 (TTE) and a compound with a C–C double bond at C-12 and C-13 when the reaction pH is varied. However, Cyc2 produced only the stereochemically pure TTE from TDP at various pH levels. These results suggested that the formation of a mixture of the three compounds from GGDP or FDP by the Cyc2 was mainly dependent on an alternative deprotonation of the carbocation of the intermediate in a similar manner as that of AS. Isoprenoids are the largest single family of compounds found in nature with over 22,000 known examples and can be classified into several groups based on the number of C5 unit derived from isopentenyl diphosphate (1Connolly J.D. Hill R.A. Dictionary of Terpenoids. Chapman & Hall, New York1992Google Scholar). The successive condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with dimethylallyl diphosphate gives rise to geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (FDP)1 (C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP, C20), which are usually cyclized by organism-specific cyclases to produce the parent skeletons of monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), and diterpenes (C20) (1Connolly J.D.

We have previously cloned and identified diterpene cyclase genes fromStreptomyces griseolosporeus MF730-N6, a diterpenoid antibiotic terpentecin (Fig. 1, compound4) producer for the first time from prokaryotes (26Dairi T. Hamano Y. Kuzuyama T. Itoh N. Furihata K. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GGDP (compound 1) was converted into terpentetriene (compound3), which had the same basic skeleton as terpentecin, in the presence of their products ORF11 and ORF12 (26Dairi T. Hamano Y. Kuzuyama T. Itoh N. Furihata K. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6085-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which were redesignated as Cyc1 and Cyc2, respectively, in this study. The Cyc1 has a weak homology with the N-terminal half of diterpene cyclases from plants and fungi; a sole protein homologous to the Cyc2 is the pentalenene synthase cloned from Streptomyces sp. UC5319 (27Cane D.E. Sohng J.K. Lamberson C.R. Rudnicki S.M., Wu, Z. Lloyd M.D. Oliver J.S. Hubbard B.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5846-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism of these cyclases, which was investigated by switching the isopentenyl diphosphate-forming pathway, one-shot labeling with perdeuterated mevalonate, and 1H NMR spectroscopy suggested that GGDP was cyclized into a clerodane skeleton through an A/B chair-boat conformation followed by a series of concerted methyl and hydride shifts to afford an intermediary carbenium ion. 2T.

We have characterized TIM10 assembly and analyzed the structural properties of its subunits, Tim9 and Tim10. Both proteins are α-helical with a protease-resistant central domain, and each self-associates to form mainly dimers and trimers in solution. Tim9 and Tim10 bound to one another with submicromolar affinity in equimolar amounts and assembled in a stable, significantly extended complex that was indistinguishable from the native mitochondrial TIM10 complex. Importantly, the reconstituted TIM10 complex is functional because it bound to the physiological substrate ADP/ATP carrier and displayed chaperone activity in refolding the model substrate firefly luciferase. These data demonstrate that the individual subunits can exist as independent, dynamically self-associating proteins. Assembly into the thermodynamically stable hexameric complex is necessary for the TIM10 chaperone function.

Cell. 1995; 83: 517-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most import and intramitochondrial sorting pathways are variants of the general “matrix pathway,” first described in detail for matrix-targeted proteins (1Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 3Neupert W.

In this pathway, a mitochondrial precursor, which is usually synthesized with an N-terminal, positively charged, amphiphilic presequence, first interacts with cytosolic chaperones. It is then bound by a hetero-oligomeric receptor system on the surface of mitochondria in a process that requires ATP hydrolysis in the cytosol. The polypeptide chain is then transported across two hetero-oligomeric protein import channels, the TOM complex in the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex in the inner membrane. Translocation is completed by the electrophoretic function of the electrochemical potential across the inner membrane and the ATP-powered import motor attached to the inner side of the TIM23 complex. In this pathway, targeting of the polypeptide chain from one complex to the other appears to be directed by increasing avidity of the positive presequence for a series of acidic receptor domains (“acid chain hypothesis”) (5Komiya T. Rospert S. Schatz G. Mihara K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Komiya T. Rospert S. Koehler C. Looser R. Schatz G. Mihara K.

The structural basis of this mechanism is becoming increasingly clear through advances in understanding the structural characteristics of key components at different steps of this pathway. First, the solution structure (determined by NMR) of the cytosolic part of the Tom20 receptor in complex with a synthetic presequence has been solved (10Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar,11Muto T. Obita T. Abe Y. Shodai T. Endo T. Kohda D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): this showed that the presequence is in α-helical conformation and that binding between the receptor and the presequence involves hydrophobic stretches. Second, the existence of a hydrophilic channel of TOM40 as the outer membrane import pore and its dynamic behavior have been established (12Hill K. Model K. Ryan M.T. Dietmeier K. Martin F. Wagner R. Pfanner N. Nature. 1998; 395: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 13Rapaport D. Kunkele K.P. Dembowski M. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell.

Third, Tim23 was shown to form a cation-selective, membrane potential-dependent channel in the inner membrane with specificity for presequences (17Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 18Lohret T.A. Jensen R.E. Kinnally K.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Finally, the crystal structure of the mitochondrial processing peptidase in complex with synthetic import signals has been determined (19Taylor A.B. Smith B.S. Kitada S. Kojima K. Miyaura H. Otwinowski Z. Ito A. Deisenhofer J. Structure. 2001; 9: 615-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This revealed that the recognition of the presequence is context-specific: in the final step of import, the presequence is recognized by the matrix protease in extended conformation, unlike the helical motif it adopts in the vicinity of the import machinery components. In this general import pathway, components in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS)1 are conspicuously absent. This could be explained by the fact that the TOM and TIM channels are thought to be juxtaposed at dynamic “contact sites” drawn together by the presequence, thereby “shielding” the precursor in a “continuous” conduit to pass from one membrane to the other. However, the situation is quite different for metabolite carriers of the inner membrane that lack a presequence and contain internal targeting sequences instead (20Adrian G.S. McCammon M.T. Montgomery D.L. Douglas M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21Pfanner N. Hoeben P. Tropfschug M. Neupert W. J. Biol.

These precursors require not only a translocation machinery in the outer and inner membranes, but, quite uniquely, a separate soluble intermembrane space complex as well (2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat.

The carrier proteins interact with a specific receptor system in the outer membrane and are then passed onto the TOM40 channel (27Ryan M.T. Muller H. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

Passage across the intermembrane space is specifically mediated by the TIM10 complex. TIM10 is exclusively made of Tim9 and Tim10 (31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), two homologous, zinc-binding proteins (25Koehler C.M. Merchant S. Oppliger W. Schmid K. Jarosch E. Dolfini L.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The TIM10 complex facilitates transfer of carriers from the outer membrane to the outer surface of the inner membrane. Then, Tim12, a protein homologous to Tim9 and Tim10 and peripherally attached to the membrane, takes over and facilitates insertion into the membrane in the context of the TIM22 complex, which contains all of Tim12, trace amounts of Tim9 and Tim10, Tim54, and Tim18 (25Koehler C.M.

Despite their sequence homology, the TIM10 complex is in large excess over Tim12 and the TIM22 complex. To account for the different localization and relative amounts of the two complexes, we have proposed that this is a “two-affinity system” (35Tokatlidis K. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35285-35288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). First, the TIM10 complex functions as a low affinity chaperone-like system, interacting with a large number of precursors, which could explain why it is needed in large amounts. Subsequently, the TIM22 system, which is a more specialized insertion machinery, interacts with high affinity with the hydrophobic precursors (2Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K.

We have recently shown by coexpression in Escherichia colithat Tim9 and Tim10 are the only two mitochondrial proteins necessary and sufficient to form the TIM10 complex (31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The functionality of the recombinant complex in organelle was shown by restoring AAC import in TIM10-deficient mitochondria upon replenishing them with Tim9 and Tim10 (31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Here, we report the in vitro reconstitution of the TIM10 complex by individually purified subunits. The subunits dynamically self-associate in α-helical structures; and upon assembly, they form a complex identical to the IMS complex. We structurally characterized the two proteins and their assembly and determined their binding affinity to be very high (K d at submicromolar range). The reconstituted complex was shown to be active by binding to AAC in vitroand showed a chaperone activity in refolding denatured luciferase. Strain BL21-Codon Plus (Stratagene) containing a plasmid expressing GST-Tim10 was grown in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) at 30 °C toA 600 nm = 0.3. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) was then added to induce the expression of GST-Tim10, and bacterial growth was continued for 3 h. The induced cell suspension was harvested, washed, and resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). Cells were broken with a French press cylinder (SLM-AMINCO) at 10,000 p.s.i. and centrifuged at 21,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The soluble part containing Tim10 was incubated overnight with 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mm NaCl). The non-bound proteins were collected, and the beads were washed with 150 ml of buffer A. After washing, the beads were resuspended with an equal volume of buffer A, and 50 units of thrombin (Sigma) was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C. The Tim10 protein was eluted with 5 ml of buffer A. GST-Tim9 was produced using identical conditions of growth and induction as described for GST-Tim10. After disruption of induced cells with a French press, GST-Tim9 was found in the inclusion bodies (pellet). These were solubilized in buffer B (1 mmDTT, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) containing 8 m urea for 1 h at room temperature and renatured overnight at 4 °C by a 10-fold dilution with buffer B. The refolded GST-Tim9 was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to eliminate remaining aggregated material, and the supernatant was incubated for 5 h with 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads equilibrated with buffer B. This procedure reproducibly yielded >50% renatured protein that could bind efficiently to glutathione-Sepharose beads, suggesting that at least the GST moiety was refolded to its native conformation. Further purification was done as described for Tim10, but using buffer B instead of buffer A. Purified Tim9 or Tim10 was concentrated up to 4–6 mg/ml using a Centriplus YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc.), and then an equal amount was mixed together and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. CD spectra were acquired using a JASCO J810 spectropolarimeter in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.6) at 25 °C using a 1-mm cuvette and protein samples of 0.05 and 0.07 mg/ml for Tim9 and Tim10, respectively. Each spectrum represents an average of four scans from 260 to 190 nm at 0.2-nm intervals. The base line was established by subtracting the spectrum of the buffer alone. Individual Tim9 or Tim10 proteins were incubated at a 1:20 (w/w) trypsin/protein ratio. Incubations were carried out at 4 °C and stopped by addition of an excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were boiled at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (see Fig. 1). To compare the individual proteins with the reconstituted complex in Fig.3 B, limited trypsinolysis was performed, but using a 1:10 trypsin/protein ratio and detection by antibodies rather than Coomassie staining to allow visualization of the proteins in the complex.Figure 3Tim9 and Tim10 assemble to form the TIM10 complex.

Solutions containing Tim9 (9), Tim10 (10), Tim9 and Tim10 together (9+10), or Tim9 and BSA (9+ BSA) were concentrated 13-fold (starting concentration in each protein of 0.02 mg/ml, 10 μg of each protein or BSA) in Microcon YM-3 microconcentrators and then centrifuged to remove insoluble proteins.

Tim9 or Tim10 was in the 1.4-ml cuvette at 10 μm, and 35 injections of 5 μl of 15× concentrated Tim10 or Tim9 were made. Protein concentration was determined by both the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and amino acid analysis. 0.42-ml samples were centrifuged in 1.2-cm path length 2-sector aluminum centerpiece cells with sapphire windows in a 4-place An-60 Ti analytical rotor running in an Optima XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) at 60,000 rpm and at a temperature of 23 °C. Changes in solute concentration were detected by Rayleigh interference. Results were analyzed using the program DCDT+ (Version 1.13) (38Stafford III, W.F. Anal.

In Tim9 experiments, samples were incubated with the homobifunctional, sulfhydryl-specific, cross-linking reagent bismaleimidohexane (Pierce). Bismaleimidohexane (100 or 500 μm or 1 mm) was added to samples and incubated on ice for 30 min before being quenched by addition of 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) for a further 10-min incubation on ice. Cross-linking was performed in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. After quenching, sample buffer was added to the reactions, which were boiled at 95 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then analyzed by Western blotting. In Tim10 experiments, samples were incubated with the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent glutaraldehyde (Sigma) (39Azem A. Oppliger W. Lustig A. Jenö P. Feifel B. Schatz G. Horst M. J. Biol.

Purified Tim10 in buffer A was chromatographed on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The effluent of the column was monitored in-line through a Dawn DSP laser photometer to measure light scattering and a Wyatt/Optilab 903 interferometric refractometer to measure sample concentration. Light scattering data were collected simultaneously at 18° between 1° and 158°, and the data were analyzed by the method of Zimm (see Refs. 40Sheehan J.K. Howard M. Richardson P.S. Longwill T.

E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with His6-AAC and grown on terrific broth (TB) medium supplemented with 1% glucose, 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin, and 0.034 mg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Following removal of glucose, cells were transferred to TB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml carbenicillin and 0.034 mg/ml chloramphenicol, and His6-AAC expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C. His6-AAC was subsequently partially purified in the presence of 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 using nickel beads (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A known amount of AAC (0.5 μg, as estimated by quantitative Western blotting using an anti-His tag antibody and a control His-tagged protein) and chymotrypsin as a control were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was subsequently blocked for 1 h with 5% (w/v) milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with authentic (IMS) or recombinant TIM10 complex (1 μg) prepared as described above plus 5% milk for 2 h. After washing, the membrane was subjected to Western blotting with anti-Tim9 or anti-Tim10 antibodies. Control incubations of buffer alone or the TIM10 complex denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min with 10 mm DTT and 10 mm EDTA were also carried out prior to Western blotting. Chemiluminescence data were collected using a Fuji LAS-1000 luminescent image analyzer. Each spot on the Western blot was subjected to densitometry using the AIDA Version 2.31 software supplied with the analyzer, and a histogram was produced from data acquired from three independent identical experiments. Luciferase (Sigma) was stored at 328 μm in enzyme buffer consisting of 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl and was denatured at 5.0 μm for 30 min at 25 °C in 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 6 m guanidine HCl and 5 mm DTT. The denatured enzyme was typically diluted 1:125 to 40 nm in refolding buffer consisting of 10 mmMOPS/KOH (pH 7.2) and 50 mm KCl in the presence of the Tim proteins or the complex at the same monomer concentration (15× molar excess over luciferase). The positive control used in the assay was the DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE chaperone system (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) at 80/400/400 nm, respectively (2:10:10 ratio over luciferase). DnaJ was incubated for 15 min in refolding buffer prior to addition of luciferase. Upon addition of the enzyme, the reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min at 25 °C; DnaK was then added; and refolding was initiated by addition of GrpE after a further 5-min incubation. The negative control consisted of denatured luciferase in refolding buffer, with the total assay volume being 200 μl. All components in this assay were compared with native enzyme at the same concentration. Native enzyme was stored at 4 °C at a concentration of 5 μm in enzyme buffer and then diluted 1:125 in refolding buffer at 25 °C to give a total volume of 200 μl. Aliquots of 4 μl were then removed at the desired time intervals and added to a luciferase assay detection kit (Promega), consisting of 50 μl of luciferase assay reagent and 10 μl of cell lysis buffer (containing 6 mg/ml BSA) in a 96-well plate. The plate was then read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LB96P luminometer for 10 s. Blue native gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, gel filtration, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tim10 was expressed as a GST fusion protein at high levels (see “Experimental Procedures”) and remained largely soluble. After binding to the glutathione-Sepharose beads and cleavage by thrombin, a single band of ∼10 kDa was detected by Coomassie staining (Fig.1 A). The identity of this band was verified by Western blotting with anti-Tim10 antibodies (data not shown) and N-terminal sequencing, which confirmed the N terminus to be Gly-Ser-Met-Ser (Gly and Ser are two residues resulting from the cloning into the BamHI site of the pGEX vector, and Met and Ser are the first two residues of Tim10). This suggested that thrombin cleavage was indeed specific, resulting in a chemically homogeneous Tim10 preparation. Secondary structure prediction for the Tim10 sequence (performed with the PHDsec (42Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and DSC (43King R.D. Sternberg M.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2298-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) programs) predicted a 55–60% α-helical structure for the protein and very little β-sheet content. To test whether the purified Tim10 protein was folded and to examine its secondary structure, far-UV circular dichroism was performed. Spectra of native Tim10 were compared with those of the protein denatured by guanidine HCl (Fig. 1 B). This spectrum of pure Tim10 displays two minima at 209 and 222 nm, which are typical for α-helical structure. In an alternative approach to test whether the protein was folded, we performed limited trypsinolysis (Fig. 2 C). At a 1:20 (w/w) trypsin/protein ratio, a stable fragment of ∼7 kDa remained intact even after 30 min of trypsinolysis (“stable Tim10 fragment”) (Fig. 1 C). The N-terminal sequence of this fragment (Ile-Gln-Ala-Ala) starts at position 18 in the sequence of Tim10. A similar N-terminal truncated fragment was obtained with proteinase K (starting at position 24, with the N-terminal sequence determined as Ala-Glu-Leu-Asp), but was further degraded with longer incubation times (data not shown). A similarly sized stable fragment was spontaneously obtained upon long incubations (more than a few weeks) of the intact Tim10 protein at 4 °C. This shows that Tim10 has a protease-resistant core of ∼7 kDa and a flexible N-terminal tail. Unlike Tim10, GST-Tim9 was intrinsically insoluble, and up to 75% of the protein accumulated in inclusion bodies (31Luciano P.V.S. Vergnolle M.A. Dyall S.D. Robinson D.R. Tokatlidis K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4099-4106Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is in agreement with the behavior of the protein in vivo: in mitoc"

Microinjection of GADD153 induces 3T3 cells to arrest at the G1/S boundary (9Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), while ectopic expression of GADD153 causes M1 myeloblast leukemia cells to undergo apoptosis (10Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Chemotherapeutic drugs, including paclitaxel, cisplatin, and etoposide, were reported to induce GADD153overexpression, which was associated with cellular injury/apoptosis (11Gately D.P. Jones J.A. Christen R. Barton R.M. Los G. Howell S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Gately D.P. Howell S.B. J. Biol.

More recently, GADD153 was reported to sensitize cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress through mechanisms that involve down-regulation of Bcl-2 and enhanced oxidant injury (14McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O., Aw, T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). However, studies to date are not sufficient to explain how the anticancer effects of GADD153 overexpression function in drug-induced apoptosis. N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR),1 a potential chemotherapeutic or chemopreventive retinamide, seems promising in terms of its effectiveness relative to toxicity. 4HPR also induces apoptosis of human neuroblastoma cells (15Vinci A.D.

Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 1674-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and human malignant hematopoietic cells. 4HPR-sensitive cells include those carrying mutations of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and which are thus unresponsive to all-trans-retinoic acid (22Delia D. Aiello A. Lombard L. Pelicci P.G. Grignani F. Formelli F. Menard S. Costa A. Veronesi U. Pierotti M.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 6036-6041PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 4HPR was found to activate RARs and several RAR-specific antagonists partially inhibited 4HPR-induced apoptosis (23Sun S.Y., Li, W. Yue P. Lippman S.M. Hong W.K. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2493-2498PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both RAR-independent and -dependent pathways are involved in 4HPR-mediated apoptosis. 4HPR stimulates the generation of intracellular free radicals, which appear to play a causative role in the induction of apoptosis in vitro (24Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Increased ceramide levels resulting from 4HPR treatment induce cell death in a p53- and caspase-independent manner through mixed apoptosis and necrosis pathways (26Maurer B.J. Melton L. Billups C. Cabot M.C. Reynolds C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1897-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, 4HPR modulates the expression levels of some apoptosis-related genes, such as p21, c-myc, and c-jun (27Sun S.Y. Yue P. Lotan R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 403-410PubMed Google Scholar), and activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated apoptotic signaling (28Chen Y.R. Zhou G. Tan T.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which 4HPR induces apoptosis remains unclear. Quite recently, we observed that 4HPR effectively induces apoptosis in Fas-defective hepatoma cells through caspase-8 activation (29You K.R. Shin M.N. Park R.K. Lee S.O. Kim D.G. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and 4HPR-induced apoptosis was effectively modulated by alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential (30You K.R. Wen J. Lee S.T. Kim D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3870-3877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanism(s) by which 4HPR induces apoptosis, we undertook to identify the gene(s) involved in this drug-induced apoptosis. Using the differential-display PCR (DD-PCR) method, we identified genes that were differentially expressed between untreated cells and 4HPR-treated cells. One of them,GADD153, which was preferentially expressed in 4HPR-treated hepatoma cells, seemed to be responsible for the induction of apoptosis and growth arrest. Thus, in this study, we address the role of GADD153 overexpression in the antitumor effects of 4HPR. The hepatoma cell lines, including Hep 3B (deletion of p53) and SK-HEP-1 (wild-typep53) (31Puisieux A. Galvin K. Troalen F. Bressac B. Marcais C Galun E Ponchel F Yakicier C, Ji J Ozturk M. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and other cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). 4HPR was kindly supplied by the Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Spring House, PA) and was dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of 10−2m and was stored in aliquots at −20 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks. 4′,6′-diamidino-z-phenylindole (DAPI),N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma. Parthenolide was obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in air containing 5% CO2. Viable cells were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by DAPI staining. Briefly, Hep 3B and SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 4HPR, or with equitoxic concentrations of 10 μm 4HPR or 15 μm 4HPR, which caused about 40% cell death, respectively, for 3 days in 6-well dishes. Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 10 min and were then stained with the DAPI reagent (1 μg/ml). Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon diaphot microscope. Apoptotic cells were recognized as condensed, fragmented, degraded nuclei, or ghosts that stained only faintly. At least 200 cells were counted for each time point, and all counting was done in a blinded fashion. Cells (1 × 106) were seeded in 6-cm Petri dishes and allowed to settle and attach. Cells were treated with 10 μm 4HPR for 48 h or 72 h. For analysis of genomic DNA, cells were harvested and combined with nonattached cells in the supernatant. Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, extracts were treated with 1 mg/ml proteinase K for an additional 16 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, then with chloroform, and was finally precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate. 20 μl of each extract (dissolved in 50 μl of H2O) was then loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel and separated in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Measurements of apoptotic cells and cell cycle distribution were performed using a modification of the technique described previously (32Kim D-G., Jo, B-H. You K-R. Ahn D-S. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cells were quantified by staining with FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Cells (1 × 106) were collected at 72 h for flow cytometric (FCM) measurement and stained with FITC-conjugated annexin V and PI as instructed by the manufacturer, and then analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) with an argon laser set to excite at 488 nm. In addition, cells were harvested at each time point and were fixed in 70% ethanol and stored at 4 °C. Cell cycle distribution was performed at the indicated intervals following 4HPR treatment. PI (40 μg/100 μl PBS) was added to 1 ×106 cells suspended in 800 μl of PBS together with 100 μl of RNase A (1 μg/ml), and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before FCM analysis of 2 × 104 cells. Red fluorescence due to propidium-bound DNA was measured using a 630 nm-long bandpass filter. Data were analyzed as single-parameter frequency histograms in an SFIT model. Modified DD-PCR was performed using a GeneHunter RNA image kit (GeneHunter Corp, Nashville, TN), based on an improved method described previously (33Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R.P. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). 4 μg of total RNAs from treated or untreated cells were reverse-transcribed with 200 units of SuperScript II RT enzyme (Invitrogen) in the presence of 1 μmol/liter 1-base anchored oligo(dT) primers for 1 h at 42 °C in a total volume of 10 μl. The reaction was terminated by incubation at 75 °C for 10 min. 2 μl of the reaction mixture was PCR-amplified with Dynazyme (Finnzyme OY, Epsoo, Finland) in 1 μmol/liter H-AP, a 13-mer (5′-end primers) and oligo(dT)15 primers (3′-end primers), using a GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT). PCR reactions and reamplification of cDNAs of interest were carried out as previously described (34Kim M.Y. Park E. Park J.H. Park D.H. Moon W.S. Cho B.H. Shin H.S. Kim D.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4568-4575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After cloning into the pGEM-T vector using the TA cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI), the sequenced cDNAs were analyzed via the BLAST program for matches in the GenBankTMdata base and were compared with each other via FASTA analysis. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum until they reached 60% confluence and were then treated with 10 μmor 15 μm 4HPR for times as indicated in the text. Total RNAs were extracted from treated or untreated cells using phenol and guanidine thiocyanate solution (Tri Reagent; Molecular Research Center, Inc. Cincinnati, OH). RNAs were then fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.0% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and were transferred to membranes. Blots were hybridized overnight in 2 × 106cpm/ml cDNA probe, labeled with [P32]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by random-priming, washed, then exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) at −70 °C, as described previously (35Kim D.G Kang H.M. Jang S.K. Shin H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As a loading control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was detected with aGAPDH cDNA probe. pGADD-LUC, a hamster GADD153promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Dr. Nikki J. Holbrook (National Institute on Aging, Baltimore, MD) (36Fawcett T.W. Eastman H.B. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14285-14289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with the pGADD-LUC construct using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Cells were plated at 2 × 104cells per well in 24-well plates, and then 18 h later the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with 500 ng of pGADD153-LUC plasmid and 50 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) as well as Lipofectin. Following the transfection, the cells were replenished with complete medium and were treated with equitoxic levels of 4HPR. The cells were lysed in 120 μl of lysis buffer at the indicated time intervals and were stored at −20 °C until assayed. Luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions and was normalized byRenilla luciferase activity. Transfection of the GADD153 gene into Hep 3B cells was performed using an expression plasmid vector encoding human GADD153 cDNA or control pcDNA3. The construct of the GADD153 expression vector was made by ligating human GADD153 (a gift from Dr. Nikki J. Holbrook) with pcDNA3 in each BamHI/XhoI site in the sense orientation. For the generation of the antisenseGADD153 expression vector, human GADD153 was PCR-amplified with the forward primer containing the XbaI restriction enzyme site (5′-GCTCTAGAGGGCTGCAGAGATGGC-3′) and the reverse primer containing the EcoRI restriction enzyme site (5′-GGAATTCGGGACTGATGCTCCCA-3′). The PCR-amplified GADD153double-strand DNA was ligated to pcDNA3 inXbaI/EcoRI site in the antisense orientation. Transfections were carried out by Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequence-verifiedGADD153-transfected and neo-transfected cells were selected in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. Finally, individual colonies were isolated using cloning rings, expanded, and assayed for expression of the transfected gene by Northern analysis and Western analysis. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS on ice and were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 4 °C and were resuspended directly into Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS (w/v), 12% glycerol (w/v), and 5% β−mercaptoethanol (v/v). Extracted proteins were resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody and were then incubated for 45 min in the secondary antibody. Following incubation in the secondary antibody, blots were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Tween, then developed using a commercial chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). GADD153 polyclonal antibody (F168) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All data were entered into Microsoft Excel 5.0, and GraphPad Software was used to perform two-tailed Student's t tests. All p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We observed that 4HPR effectively induced cell death in a concentration-dependent manner after 3 days in culture. Hep 3B cells, which have a defect in p53 function, rounded up, shrank, and detached during 3 days of exposure to 10 μm 4HPR. In contrast, SK-HEP-1 cells, which have normal p53 function, were less susceptible to 4HPR-induced cell death. The IC50 for Hep 3B and for SK-HEP-1 cells was 12.5 and 17.5 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 A). Thus, we used equitoxic concentrations, 10 and 15 μm, that caused 40% cell death of Hep 3B and SK-HEP-1 cells, respectively. Cells exposed to those equitoxic concentrations of 4HPR for 3 days were stained with Annexin V and PI to prove apoptotic cell death. 4HPR effectively induced apoptosis in up to 40% of those hepatoma cells, as shown by their positive staining for Annexin V as assessed by FCM (Fig.1 B). The percent of cells in the sub-G1 fraction that were stained with PI showed similar results (data not shown). In support of those findings, staining with the DNA-binding dye DAPI revealed condensed chromatin and fragmented nuclear morphologies characteristic of apoptosis in Hep 3B and SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cells. The percentage of apoptotic cells measured using DAPI was the same as the apoptotic population measured by FCM in each cell line (data not shown). We identified theGADD153 gene, which is preferentially expressed in apoptotic Hep 3B cells, by the DD-PCR method (Fig. 1 C) and confirmed that equitoxic levels of 4HPR caused the prominent induction of GADD153 mRNA in Hep 3B and SK-HEP1 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 D, upper panels). Next we determined whether the GADD153 protein expression correlates with GADD153 mRNA induction during 4HPR-induced apoptosis. 4HPR induced the expression of GADD 153 protein, which relates to GADD153 mRNA expression. (Fig.1 D, lower panels). In addition, to check whether GADD153 is also induced in other types of cancer cells by 4HPR, we choose colon (HCT116 and HT29), lung (A549 and NCI-H522), and breast (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines, according to p53 function (wild-type and mutant type, respectively), and kidney cancer cells with wild-type p53 (A498 and ACHN) (37O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Bae I. Myers T.G. Fan S. Mutoh M. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Sausville E.A. Weinstein J.N. Friend S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Kohn K.W. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4285-4300PubMed Google Scholar). Each cell line was treated with 10 μm 4HPR for 48 h. The apoptotic cell death was counted by staining with DAPI and ranged from 21 to 51% (Fig.2 A) while less than 7% of untreated control cells were apoptotic. 4HPR also induced GADD153 overexpression in all cell lines, independent of their functional p53 status (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, GADD153overexpression by 4HPR seems to be general, not cell specific. To determine the effect of 4HPR on activation of the GADD153 promoter, Hep 3B and SK-HEP-1 cells were transiently transfected with pGADD-LUC, which contains the hamster GADD153 promoter coupled to the luciferase reporter gene (11Gately D.P. Jones J.A. Christen R. Barton R.M. Los G. Howell S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 70: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Those transfected cells were exposed to 10 or 15 μm 4HPR, respectively, for 48 h (Fig.3 A). The lack of change in luciferase activity (relative to the level in untreated control cells) indicated that 4HPR did not increase GADD153 promoter activation in transfected Hep 3B cells. In contrast, in SK-HEP-1 cells, 4HPR increased GADD153 promoter activation in a time-dependent manner that corresponded well with its effect on the level of endogenous GADD153 mRNA (over 4-fold induction of GADD153 mRNA after 48 h treatment with 4HPR). These results suggest that 4HPR increasesGADD153 mRNA levels at the post-transcriptional level in Hep 3B cells, whereas it occurs at the transcriptional level in SK-HEP-1 cells. To further investigate the post-transcriptional regulation by 4HPR, we investigated whether 4HPR might affect the stability of GADD153 mRNA. The decline ofGADD153 mRNA levels in 4HPR-treated cells was examined following 4HPR withdrawal and/or the addition of a inhibitor of transcription, actinomycin D. Subconfluent Hep 3B cells or SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with 10 or 15 μm 4HPR, respectively, for 48 h to bring about the accumulation of GADD153mRNA levels. Cells treated with 4HPR were then fed with 4HPR-free medium and to which 4HPR alone, actinomycin D (Act D, 5 μg/ml)+4HPR, or Act D+vehicle was added, respectively (13Eymin B. Dubrez L. Allouche M. Solary E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 686-695PubMed Google Scholar). This time is considered 0 h. RNA was extracted at subsequent time points from each group, and relative mRNA levels were calculated by comparison of GAPDH-normalized values with the level observed in cells at time 0 (Fig. 3 B). 4HPR sustained the increase of GADD153 mRNA following treatment for 12 h in both Hep 3B cells and SK-HEP-1 cells. In the presence of actinomycin D, 4HPR did not change the GADD153 mRNA level in Hep 3B cells, whereas 4HPR slowly decreased theGADD153 mRNA level in SK-HEP-1 cells. The half-life (t 12) of GADD153 mRNA is ∼5 h. The treatment with vehicle progressively decreased the GADD153mRNA level in both cell lines. However, the rate of decrease ofGADD153 mRNA was higher in SK-HEP-1 cells (t 12 ∼1 h) than in Hep 3B cells (t 12 ∼2 h). These results imply that 4HPR regulates GADD153 mRNA levels post-transcriptionally in Hep 3B cells and at the transcriptional level in SK-HEP 1 cells, in accordance with results from the in vitro transfection experiment. In contrast, in the presence of actinomycin D, the rate of decrease of GADD153 mRNA was higher during vehicle treatment than during 4HPR treatment in SK-HEP-1 cells, suggesting that some post-transcriptional regulation of the GADD153 mRNA concurrently exists. Thus, 4HPR may regulate GADD153mRNA expression post-transcriptionally and/or transcriptionally in a cell specific manner. To determine the role of GADD153 protein overexpression, we introduced the GADD153 expression system into Hep 3B cells because these cells expressed less constitutive GADD153. Two types of Hep 3B cells (3B-G1 and 3B-G5), which stably expressed different levels of human GADD153 protein, were isolated (Fig.4 A) and then treated with 10 μm 4HPR. In the cells transfected withGADD153, the level of expression was compared with that observed in 4HPR-treated cells. Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of GADD153 mRNA in the transfectants was lower than that seen in the treated cells, thus it does not seem to be sufficient to induce apoptosis on its own. Compared with control cells transfected with the empty vector alone (3B-C1 and 3B-C2), the 3B-G1 and the 3B-G5 cells became readily apoptotic within 48 h of treatment (p < 0.01). 3B-G1 cells, which express less ectopic GADD153, were up to 70% apoptotic while 3B-G5 cells, which express more ectopic GADD153, were up to 80% apoptotic (Fig. 4 B). The proportion of apoptotic cells seems to be related to the expression level of the GADD153 protein. Furthermore, both types of cells were apoptotic (27.0 or 52.5%, respectively,p < 0.01) at confluence after 72 h of culture even without any drug treatment (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that confluence or nutrient depletion also sensitizes both types of cells to apoptosis. This was confirmed since serum deprivation resulted in similar proportions of apoptotic cells, which displayed disintegrated nuclei and nonrandom DNA fragmentation, as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA (Fig. 4 C, lower left). Similarly, the apoptotic sub-G1 fraction of the cells was increased by confluence using FCM analysis (Fig.4 C, lower right). These results suggest that apoptotic cell execution induced by 4HPR or by confluence/nutrient depletion is higher in GADD153transfectants than in vector control cells. Hep 3B cells that stably overexpress GADD153 protein showed lower cell numbers than the vector control cells during culture. Thus, we investigated whether GADD153 overexpression is associated with inhibition of cell growth. Thymidine uptake assays for DNA synthesis were significantly inhibited i.e. 70 and 53% of the control in 3B-G1 and 3B-G5 cells, respectively (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5 A). We next analyzed the impact of GADD153 overexpression on the cell cycle of Hep 3B cells. In asynchronized cells, GADD153 overexpression increased the G1 fraction of cells from 45.9 to 59.7%, compared with vector control cells after 12 h in culture (Fig. 5 B). Thus, we further studied the cell cycle inhibition in synchronized cells. For synchronization, Hep 3B cells were arrested in M phase with 0.5 μg/ml nocodazole. Cells were then analyzed at 3-h intervals following release from the M block. Cells that stably overexpressed GADD153 clearly showed delayed cell cycling and G1 arrest (disappearance of G2/M), and thus, GADD153 overexpression seems to be responsible for the G1 growth arrest. We examined whether prevention of GADD153 overexpression might lead to the inhibition of 4HPR-induced apoptosis. The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is responsible for 4HPR-induced apoptosis in some tumor cells (24Delia D. Aiello A. Meroni L. Nicolini M. Reed J.C. Pierotti M.A. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Oridate N. Suzuki S. Higuchi M. Mitchell M.F. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we observed that an antioxidant NAC effectively inhibited 4HPR-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells, although not completely (29You K.R. Shin M.N."

Previously described glutaredoxins are small proteins (about 10 kDa) with a conserved active site that includes two cysteine residues (Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys). Site-directed mutagenesis (3Nikkola M.

In contrast, the amino-terminal cysteine is sufficient to catalyze the deglutathionylation of the reduced glutathione-mixed disulfides that are formed under oxidative stress conditions (5Bushweller J.H.

These studies have revealed which residues, apart from those at the active site, are important for stable interactions between glutathione and the glutaredoxin molecule (10Bushweller J.H. Billeter M.

This superfamily shares a structural motif (called the thioredoxin fold or αβα fold) formed by a four or five-stranded β-sheet (with parallel and antiparallel strands) surrounded by three or more α-helices distributed on either side of the β-sheet (15Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar,16Ferrari D.M. Söling H.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Thioredoxins share with glutaredoxins the ability to reduce disulfides, although the former directly use NADPH as hydrogen donor (1Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dithiol glutaredoxins participate in a large number of functions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, including the activation of ribonucleotide reductase (17Holmgren A. J. Biol.

A family of threeSaccharomyces cerevisiae proteins (Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5) has been described (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) that has significant homology with dithiol glutaredoxins, preferentially at the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecules. The absence of any of these proteins leads to a decrease in cellular glutaredoxin activity, even though they do not contain the conserved active site of classic dithiol glutaredoxins. Instead, these proteins contain the conserved Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser motif at the amino-terminal region (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This is the only cysteine residue found in Grx3 and Grx4, whereas Grx5 has an additional cysteine at the carboxyl-terminal moiety. From these data, it has been proposed that Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5 constitute a family of monothiol glutaredoxins in yeast (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, although there is a high degree of homology among them, these three proteins seem to carry out different cellular functions: the absence of Grx5 causes dramatic sensitivity to oxidants and growth defects in minimal medium, whereas no clear phenotypes are observed when Grx3 or Grx4 is absent. More recently, it has been shown that Grx5 is located at the mitochondria and involved in the biogenesis of iron/sulfur clusters (24Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cellular iron when Grx5 is absent could lead to protein oxidation and sensitivity to external oxidants. Available data about Grx3 and Grx4 indicate that they are not located in the mitochondria (24Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Proteins homologous to yeast monothiol glutaredoxins exist in all types of organisms from bacteria to humans (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The human homologue (PICOT1 protein) has been proposed as a negative regulator of protein kinase C-θ in the pathway leading to activation of the activator protein 1 and nuclear factor κB transcription factors (27Witte S. Villalba M., Bi, K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The conserved region has been termed PICOT homology domain, and in Grx5, it corresponds to the majority of the peptide (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Human PICOT, yeast Grx3 and Grx4, and other eukaryotic homologous proteins possess amino-terminal extensions of PICOT homology domain. These extensions have signatures characteristic of thioredoxins or dithiol glutaredoxins that do not encompass the oxidoreductase active site (25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All these observations support the differential roles displayed by monothiol glutaredoxins regardless of their structural similarities. In this work, we show that Grx5 defines a ubiquitous family of proteins whose members are present in most types of organisms and are characterized by the presence of a thioredoxin fold structure. We also demonstrate the essential biological roles of a number of conserved amino acid residues, such as a cysteine located at the previously proposed active site in the amino-terminal region and a pair of glycines in the carboxyl-terminal region. CML235 (MAT a ura3-52 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200) was used as wild-type strain. MML19 is an isogenicΔgrx5::kanMX4 derivative of CML235 (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E.

MML160 was obtained from the latter by chromosomal integration of the YIplac211 vector (integrative, LEU2 marker) (28Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 3065-3073Google Scholar).

Point mutations in the GRX5 open reading frame that yielded the different amino acid replacements were constructed by the ExSite method (31Weiner M.P. Costa L. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 613-621Google Scholar), using either pMM25 or pCM319 DNA as a template. Oligonucleotides for PCR amplification were designed in such a way that a restriction site that did not alter the translation product was introduced near to the desired point mutation and used as a marker for it. Successful introduction of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were usually grown at 30 °C in rich YPD medium. Plasmid-bearing transformants were grown in synthetic complete medium (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) without the selective auxotrophic requirement. Plates of synthetic defined medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic requirements) were used to test mutant growth. Cells growing exponentially in YPD medium at 30 °C (about 2 × 107 cells/ml) were treated with menadione (10 mm) to determine sensitivity to it. After treatment, 1:5 serial dilutions were made, and drops were spotted onto YPD plates. Growth was recorded after 2 days of incubation at 30 °C. Protein carbonyl levels in crude cell extracts were quantified according to the dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatization method (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Total iron cell content was determined under reducing conditions, after acid digestion of cells using 3% nitric acid (33Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Mean cell volumes were determined in nonfixed cells using a Coulter Z2 counter to calculate cell iron concentration. Exponentially growing cells that overexpressed GRX5 under the control of thetetO 7 promoter were added to doxycycline (20 μg/ml) to interrupt gene expression. At successive times, samples were taken, and total cell extracts were prepared (24Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Western analyses were carried out using a polyclonal antibody prepared againstEscherichia coli-expressed full-length Grx5 protein at a 1:2500 dilution (24Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellı́ G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In each experiment, equal amounts of total cell protein (60 μg) were run in parallel for each sample. The relative level of Grx5 was determined from the intensity of the Grx5 band signal, following quantification with the Lumi-Imager equipment (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) software. Protein structures related to Grx5 were identified by applying the GenThreader fold recognition method (34Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 797-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Two structures offering maximal probability of correct match were selected and collected from the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank accession numbers 1KTE and 3GRX). They respectively corresponded to pig liver thioltransferase (7Katti S.K. Robbins A.H. Yang Y. Wells W.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1998-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and E. coliGrx3 glutaredoxin (14Nordstrand K. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Different models of Grx5 based on these protein structures were obtained using the Swiss-Model server (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar, 36Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch M.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein structures were analyzed applying the Swiss-PDB Viewer program (35Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar). Grx5 amino acid sequence was compared with proteins from the Institute for Chemical Research (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) and Swiss Protein Databases using FASTA analysis provided by the two servers. Multiple sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55767) Google Scholar) and the tools provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute. Internal gaps were not eliminated, and the Blosum80 matrix option was used for alignment. Yeast Grx5 has been characterized as a monothiol glutaredoxin-like protein whose amino acid sequence displays extensive homology (particularly at what have been designated its amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions) with a family of proteins whose members are present in all living organisms from bacteria to humans (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region also has significant homology with classic dithiol glutaredoxins (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To extend these initial studies, the Institute for Chemical Research and Swiss Protein Databases were searched for proteins with the highest homology with Grx5 (Evalue cutoff, 1 × e −10), using FASTA analysis. We only considered proteins that retained the putative active site CGFS sequence in the amino-terminal region (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) for comparison. The 35 protein sequences with the highest similarity score with Grx5 were then aligned using the ClustalW program (Fig.1). A putative Grx5 homologue fromCandida albicans, as deduced from the genome sequence of the latter organism, was also included for comparison. Extensions at the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends (that are present only in some of the family members (see below)) were omitted for the alignment. The existence of two amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions with extensive homology (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) (separated by a less well-conserved region with a slightly variable length) was confirmed in this extended study. Most multicellular eukaryotic members of the Grx5 family have large amino-terminal extensions. This is also the case for the S. cerevisiae Grx3 and Grx4 glutaredoxins and for one of the two sequences in fission yeast (Fig. 1). This amino-terminal extension includes a highly conserved duplication of the region shown in Fig. 1in the cases of human and rat species and in one of the two mouse species (Q9JLZ2M) (Ref. 25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and this study). Interestingly, theArabidopsis thaliana protein Q9ZPH2A (but not other members of the same protein family in this plant species) contains three conserved domains in tandem, but only the most carboxyl-terminal of these is shown in the Fig. 1 alignment. On the other hand, S. cerevisiae Grx5, the C. albicans Grx5 homologous protein, the other fission yeast protein, and all bacterial members of the family have shorter versions of the protein without amino-terminal extensions. The domain shown in the alignments is almost totally coincident with the PICOT homology domain region named after the human Grx5 homologue (25Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Witte S. Villalba M., Bi, K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our study shows that this domain may be shared by proteins from prokaryotes (both Archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotes. These proteins may have divergent functions and different cellular locations. Grx5 has sequence similarity with dithiol glutaredoxins, mostly at the carboxyl-terminal moiety (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a number of dithiol glutaredoxins was already known, from either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy studies. Structures in the Protein Data Bank were used to construct a three-dimensional model for Grx5. Two protein structures, pig liver thioltransferase (1KTE) (7Katti S.K. Robbins A.H. Yang Y. Wells W.W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1998-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and E. coli Grx3 glutaredoxin (3GRX) (14Nordstrand K. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), yielded useful models for Grx5. Amino acid sequences of these two proteins show 28% and 29% identity to Grx5, respectively. Models based both individually and simultaneously on 1KTEand 3GRX yielded almost identical results for a large, carboxyl-terminal part of the protein, which represented about two-thirds of the sequence. Differences in the amino-terminal part were attributed to the poor quality of the 3GRX-based model because homology of E. coli Grx3 to Grx5 is low in this region. The 1KTEstructure (Fig. 2 A) was therefore finally taken as the basis for the Grx5 model (Fig.2 B), which is considered to provide a valid representation of the Grx5 protein structure. The proposed model shows an αβα fold typical of thiol oxidoreductases and other enzymes from the superfamily (15Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Four α-helix segments are predicted: amino acids 61–71 (α1), 92–98 (α2), 117–125 (α3), and 129–135 (α4) (Fig. 1, top row). For comparison, Fig. 2 C shows the structure of phage T4 glutaredoxin (1ABA) (6Eklund H. Ingelman M. Söderberg B.-O. Uhlin T. Nordlund P. Nikkola M. Sonnerstam U. Joelsson T. Petratos K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 596-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is one of the simplest (structurally speaking) representatives of the thioredoxin fold superfamily. The model shows that the similarity between Grx5 and other proteins from the superfamily extends to the amino-terminal moiety of the molecule. Grx5 contains two cysteine residues at positions 60 and 117. The first is part of a conserved sequence common to all members of the family (Ref. 23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). It is exposed at the surface of Grx5 between a β-strand and α1 (Fig.3). Cys117 is only present in certain family members (Fig. 1), although many dithiol glutaredoxins also contain a cysteine residue in an equivalent position (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This cysteine is the first α3 residue and follows two glycine residues that are conserved in all the dithiol and monothiol glutaredoxins (Fig. 3; Ref. 23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cys60 and Cys117 were separately substituted by serine residues, and the biological effects of these mutations were studied after reintroducing the respective mutant Grx5 forms into a strain that was devoid of the wild-type version. Initially, two phenotypes were studied that had been shown to be affected in null grx5 mutants (23Rodrı́guez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar): sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by menadione, and defective growth in synthetic defined medium. Cells with the C60S mutation in Grx5 behaved like those without the protein, whereas those with the C117S change did not differ with respect to wild-type cells (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, the absence of Cys60 annuls the biological activity of Grx5, whereas Cys117 is not essential for it. These results demonstrate that Cys60 is the active residue for the oxidoreductase reaction and confirm observations for two dithiol glutaredoxins, pig liver thioltransferase (4Yang Y. Wells W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12759-12765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coliGrx3 (14Nordstrand K. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Otting G. Berndt K.D. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2039899658,"After treatment of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase with proteinase K (PK) in the presence of Ca(2+) and a protecting non-phosphorylated ligand (e.g. adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylenetriphosphate), we were able to prepare in high yield an ATPase species that only differs from intact ATPase because of excision of the MAATE(243) sequence from the loop linking the A domain with the third transmembrane segment. The PK-treated ATPase was unable to transport Ca(2+) and to catalyze ATP hydrolysis, but it could bind two calcium ions with high affinity and react with ATP to form a classical ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, Ca(2)E1P, with occluded Ca(2+). The ability of Ca(2)E1P to become converted to the Ca(2+)-free ADP-insensitive form, E2P, was strongly reduced, as was the ability of PK-treated ATPase to react with orthovanadate or to form an E2P intermediate from inorganic phosphate in the absence of Ca(2+). PK-treated ATPase also reacted with thapsigargin to form a complex with altered properties, and the tryptic cleavage T2 site in the A domain was no longer protected in the absence of Ca(2+). It is probable that disrupting the C-terminal link of the A domain with the transmembrane region severely compromises reorientation of A and P domains and the functionally critical cross-talk of these domains with the membrane-bound Ca(2+) ions."

Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It has been shown in a variety of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species that the genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the production and transport of these polysaccharides are usually clustered in large operons that can comprise over 20 different loci. In addition, it has been found that each of these operons includes also a pair of genes that encode two opposing activities, a protein-tyrosine kinase and a phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatase, namely inAcinetobacter johnsonii (2Grangeasse C.

Phosphorylation of bacterial proteins on tyrosine has been demonstrated for the first time by overproducing and purifying a particular phosphoprotein, termed Ptk, from A. johnsonii and by showing its capacity to autophosphorylate in vitro at the expense of ATP (8Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 9Grangeasse C. Vincent C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B.

Then, other protein-tyrosine kinases, homologous to Ptk, have been characterized in several other species, namely, protein Wzc from E. coli K-12 (10Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E.

Biochem. Physiol. 2002; 131: 103-112Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reversibility of protein tyrosine phosphorylation has been evidenced by showing the presence, in the same bacterial species, of phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases of low molecular mass able to specifically dephosphorylate the cognate protein-tyrosine kinases (10Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C.

Biol. 1998; 278: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a possible regulatory role for tyrosine phosphorylation. The occurrence of a biological link between tyrosine phosphorylation and exopolysaccharide/capsular polysaccharide production and, consequently, between tyrosine phosphorylation and bacterial pathogenicity is supported by a number of recent observations. For instance, phosphorylation of the E. coli tyrosine autokinase Wzc is essential for the assembly of group I capsular polysaccharides (11Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Conversely, when this protein is phosphorylated, the production of the particular exopolysaccharide, colanic acid, is blocked, but production starts again when Wzc is dephosphorylated by its cognate phosphoprotein phosphatase, Wzb (12Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, phosphorylation of the protein-tyrosine kinase CpsD negatively regulates the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides (17Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and this control is modulated by the phosphatase activity of protein CpsB (18Bender M.H. Yother J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47966-47974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 19Morona J.K. Morona R. Miller D.C. Paton J.C. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Also, in S. meliloti, the molecular mass distribution of the acidic exopolysaccharide, succinoglycan, is directly influenced by the specific phosphorylation of protein ExoP (14Niemeyer D. Becker A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5163-5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In none of these cases, however, has the process of tyrosine phosphorylation and its relationship to polysaccharide production been described at the molecular level. The only exception concerns the mechanism of autophosphorylation of protein Wzc from E. coliK-12 (20Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This tyrosine kinase of 720 amino acids, bound to the inner membrane of cells, consists of two functional domains: a C-terminal domain that contains the tyrosine kinase activity and can undergo autophosphorylation, and an N-terminal domain that is not phosphorylated and does not influence the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation occurs at the expense of ATP molecules that bind to Walker A and B motifs of the C-terminal domain. This domain contains six different sites of phosphorylation; five of these sites are located at the extreme C-terminal end of the molecule in the form of a tyrosine cluster, and one site is located upstream, at Y569. It has been shown that Y569 can first autophosphorylate through an intramolecular reaction that induces an enhanced kinase activity of Wzc, resulting, in turn, in the phosphorylation of the five terminal tyrosines by an intermolecular process. This cooperative two-step mechanism may be part of the cascade of reactions involved in signal transduction in bacteria (20Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In search of the mode of functioning of protein Wzc, it seemed of interest to analyze its structural organization within the cell and determine whether the two functional domains previously characterizedin vitro could be connected with particular structural domains in vivo. For this, we have examined the membrane topology of Wzc by performing a series of experiments based on translational fusions of lacZ and phoA reporter genes to the wzc gene. The corresponding results have been compared with the predictive data deduced from the theoretical hydropathic profile of the protein. In addition, we have tested the possibility that Wzc could oligomerize in vivo, and we have assessed the effect of phosphorylation on oligomerization. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. E. coli JM109 strain was used as template for PCR amplification of different DNA fragments of the wzc gene. E. coli DH5α was used to testwzc::lacZ fusions. The phoAdeletion strain CC118, in which thewzc::phoA fusions were expressed, was kindly provided by J. T. Beatty (25LeBlanc H.N. Beatty J.T. J.

Minimal medium M9 supplemented with 0.5 mm IPTG1 was used for β-galactosidase assays and radioactive labeling of protein Wza. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and 15 μg/ml tetracyclin. Chromogenic substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside were used at a concentration of 40 μg/ml each in Luria plate. Plasmids were purified by using a Qiaprep Purification Kit (Qiagen). All restriction enzymes, calf intestine phosphatase, T4 DNA ligase, Klenow fragment, and Taq DNA polymerase were used as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Transformation of E. coli cells was performed as reported previously (27Dagert M. Ehrlich S.D. Gene (Amst.). 1979; 6: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). To construct translational fusions of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) at various points within Wzc, PCR products were prepared by using a forward primer for 5′ wzc gene (Pho1), paired with nine different downstream reverse primers (Pho2 to Pho10) (Table II). Restriction sites for BamHI and KpnI enzymes were included in Pho1 and Pho2–10 primers, respectively. Genomic DNA from E. coli JM109 strain was used as template. The amplified fragments were restricted by BamHI and KpnI and inserted into the pUC19-phoA vector opened with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmids were used to transform the E. coli strain CC118.Table IIOligonucleotides used in this studyPrimer5′ to 3′ Sequence2-aStart and stop codons are in bold, restriction sites are italicized, and ribosome binding site sequences are underlined.Pho1TATGGATCC ATGACAGAAAAAGTAAAACAACATGCCGCTCCGGPho2TATGGTACCGCTTCAATGACGGTGCCGPho3TATGGTACCGCACTATAAATCGGCGTGGCGPho4TATGGTACCTGTTCACGATCTTCACCPho5TATGGTACCCGTTACGCGACCGTTAAGPho6TATGGTACCTGAGTGATTGCCGGGTCPho7TATGGTACCGGGCTTTCAATGCCGCGPho8TATGGTACCTGGCTGATCACCGCCGCPho9TATGGTACCACCGCATAACGCGCCACCPho10TATGGTACCGCATCCGACTTATATTCGLac1TATGGTACC ATGACAGAAAAAGTAAAACAACATGCCGCTCCGGLac2TATGGATCCGCTTCAATGACGGTGCCGLac3TATGGATCCGCACTATAAATCGGCGTGGCGLac4TATGGATCCTGTTCACGATCTTCACCLac5TATGGATCCTGAGTGATTGCCGGGTCLac6TATGGATCCGGGCTTTCAATGCCGCGLac7TATGGATCCTGGCTGATCACCGCCGCLac8TATGGATCCACCGCATAACGCGCCACCLac9TATGGATCCGCATCCGACTTATATTCGOligo1CCGGAATTC AGGAGGTATAAGAATGACAGAAAAAGOligo2CGGGGTACC TTATTTCGCATCCGACTTATATTCGOligo3CGGGGTACC TTAGCCGCGATTAAACAACGAGCOligo4CCGGAATTCAGGAGGCGTGATGAAACCGAAGAAAGGGCOligo5CCGGAATTC AGGAGGCGCTCGATGTTTAATCGCGGCOligo6CGGGGTACC TTACGCGCTGGCGCGGCGGAAOligo7TATGGATCCACAGAAAAAGTAAAACAACATGCCGCOligo8CGGGGTACC TTAGCCGCGATTAAACAACGAGCOligo9CAGACCAATAAACGCGTGTTGOligo10CGGGGTACC TTATTTCGCATCCGACTTAOligo K540MGCCCGTCAATTGGTATGACCTTTGTCTGCGCCEcoO190I/StuIprimerGAGACGAAAGGCCTCGTGATACWza1CGGGGTACC AGGAGGTAAACAATGATGAAATCCAAAATGWza2CGCGGATCC TTACCAGTTATGAATGTCGCT2-a Start and stop codons are in bold, restriction sites are italicized, and ribosome binding site sequences are underlined. Open table in a new tab To obtain in-frame fusions of lacZ gene to wzc, DNA fragments encoding various Wzc polypeptides were synthesized by PCR amplification, using genomic DNA from JM109 as template and the following primers: a forward primer complementary to the 5′ end ofwzc (Lac1), and eight different reverse primers complementary to different sequences at the 3′ end of thewzc gene (Lac2 to Lac9) (Table II). Restriction sites, namely, a KpnI site in Lac1 primer and a BamHI site in Lac2–9 oligonucleotides, were included. The PCR products were digested by BamHI and KpnI and cloned into the pSP72-lacZ vector restricted with the same enzymes. Thewzc::lacZ fusions were then subcloned into plasmid pUC18-ΔlacZ. This vector was first obtained by deleting the lacZ′ gene of pUC18 with NdeI andHindIII restriction enzymes and treating with Klenow fragment to fill in the 3′-recessed ends. Thewzc::lacZ fusions were then excised from pSP72 with KpnI and HindIII and subcloned into the polylinker of the resulting pUC18-ΔlacZ vector, opened with the same enzymes. The plasmids thus obtained were used to transform the DH5α strain of E. coli. Various DNA fragments encoding the entire Wzc protein or its N- and C-terminal domains were obtained by PCR amplification, using JM109 E. coli DNA as template and six different oligonucleotides (Table II, oligos 1–6). A restriction site forEcoRI, a start codon ATG, and a ribosome-binding site were included in forward primers. A site for KpnI enzyme was added in reverse primers. The PCR products were digested byEcoRI and KpnI enzymes and cloned into pUC18-rcsA + opened with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid, pUC18-wzc 1–2163-rcsA +, encoded the entire Wzc protein. Plasmid pUC18-wzc 1–1356-rcsA +expressed the N-terminal domain of Wzc (from codon 1 to codon 452) including the two transmembrane helices, TM1 and TM2. Plasmid pUC18-wzc 1260–2163-rcsA +encoded the C-terminal domain including the transmembrane helix TM2. The pUC18-wzc 1345-2163-rcsA +construct expressed the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Wzc, without any transmembrane helix, from codon 449 to the stop codon. Plasmid pUC18-wzc 1260–2112-rcsA + encoded the C-terminal domain, from codon 421 to codon 704, deleted from the C-terminal tyrosine cluster (Fig. 4). The N-terminal domain of Wzc with the two transmembrane helices, tagged with six histidine residues at its N terminus, was expressed from pQE30-wzc 1–1356. This construct was obtained by synthesizing the corresponding 1356-bp DNA fragment by PCR amplification, using oligos 7 and 8 as primer pair (Table II). The amplified DNA fragment was restricted by BamHI andKpnI enzymes and inserted into the pQE30 vector opened with the same enzymes. Mutant Wzc proteins modified on the sites of intra- or inter- phosphorylation were expressed, respectively, from pUC18-wzc Y569F-rcsA+ and pUC18-wzc L6-rcsA+. These constructs were obtained by PCR amplification, using plasmids pQE30–41-Y569F and pQE30–41-L6 as templates (20Grangeasse C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7127-7135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Restriction sites for MluI and KpnI were included respectively in forward (Table II, oligo 9) and reverse (Table II, oligo 10) primers. Amplified DNA fragments were digested by MluI andKpnI enzymes and cloned into pUC18-wzc-rcsA+, previously deleted from the wild-type MluI-KpnI wzcfragment. Plasmid pUC18-wzc K540M-rcsA +encoding a mutant Wzc protein, modified on the lysine residue in the Walker A motif involved in ATP binding, was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis by using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from CLONTECH, based on the method developed in Ref. 28Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The strategy of this method lies in the fact that, in addition to the mutagenic oligonucleotide, a selection oligonucleotide containing a mutation in a unique restriction site within the target plasmid is used. Such a procedure was applied directly to pUC18-wzc 1–2163-rcsA + by using an oligonucleotide that introduced the expected substitution, K540M, and a selection primer that eliminated the uniqueEcoO109I restriction site present on the pUC18-wzc 1–2163-rcsA +vector (Table II). The occurrence of the mutation was checked by DNA sequencing (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding protein Wza was obtained by PCR amplification, using the forward primer Wza1 that contained aKpnI site and the reverse primer Wza2, in which aBamHI site was included. The PCR product was restricted withKpnI and BamHI enzymes and inserted in the corresponding sites of either the pUC18-rcsA +plasmid or the pUC18-wzc 1–2163-rcsA+construct. The resulting plasmids, pUC18-wza-rcsA+ and pUC18-wzc-wza-rcsA+, encoded either protein Wza alone or proteins Wza and Wzc, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase activity of translational fusions Wzc-PhoA was first assessed by plating cells of E. coli strain CC118 transformed by each fusion onto LB agar containing the chromogenic 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate. Alkaline phosphatase assay was then performed as described previously (23Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed on LB agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside substrate. It was further quantified by using the procedure described in Ref. 30, except that cells were permeabilized with 0.1% SDS and chloroform instead of toluene. The activity of enzymes was calculated relative to the number of bacterial cells according to Refs. 23Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 30. A monoclonal antibody specific to Wzc was prepared by immunizing mice with the C-terminal domain (amino acids 447–720) of Wzc mutated in the ATP-binding site (lysine residue 540). This mutant was unable to bind ATP and therefore unable to autophosphorylate. This procedure avoided the production of nonspecific antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine. Large scale production of the C-terminal fragment of Wzc was obtained by overexpression of the corresponding 824-bp DNA fragment in the pQE30 vector, as described previously (12Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). K540M substitution was carried out by site-directed mutagenesis using the Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from CLONTECH, as described above. Briefly, plasmid pQE30-wzc 1345–2163 was used as template for mutagenesis with an oligonucleotide that introduced the expected substitution and a selective primer that eliminated a uniqueXbaI restriction site on pQE30-wzc 1345–2163. The mutated plasmid was transferred into the E.coliBL21(pREP4-groESL) strain. Cells were then grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.5, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth was continued for 4 h at the same temperature. The fusion protein 6His-Wzc447–720/K540M was extracted and purified to homogeneity by using an Ni2+-immobilized matrix. Mice were immunized with the corresponding purified fusion protein. Several monoclonal antibodies were thus prepared as described previously (31Lethias C. Descollonges Y. Garrone R. van der Rest M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 92-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of strain JM83(pUC18-rcsA +) expressing endogenous protein Wzc and strains JM83wzc::KmR(pUC18-Δwzc-rcsA +) and JM83wzc::KmR(pQE30-wzc 1–1356) encoding various domains of Wzc were subcultured and grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 1 mm IPTG untilA 600 reached 1.0. Cross-linking experiments were then carried out with two different cross-linkers, formaldehyde and dithio-bis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in ice-cold 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.8, and resuspended in the same buffer to obtain anA 600 of 1.0. Formaldehyde (37%, w/w) was added to a final concentration varying from 0.01% to 2%, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 23 °C. Cross-linked samples (4 ml) were washed once in 6 ml of ice-cold 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.8, and resuspended in 160 μl of loading buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 20 μl were heated either at 60 °C for 10 min or at 100 °C for 20 min to reverse cross-linking and then loaded on polyacrylamide gel. For DSP experiments, cells were washed and resuspended in an appropriate volume of phosphate-buffered saline buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) to reach A 600 = 2. DSP was used at a final concentration ranging from 10 to 100 μm. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the cross-linking reagent was quenched by addition of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cross-linked samples (4 ml) were resuspended in 160 μl of loading buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) without or with β-mercaptoethanol to reverse DSP cross-linking. Aliquots were then heated at 100 °C for 5 min before loading on gel. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western immunoblotting by using one of the monoclonal anti-Wzc antibodies described above. The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse IgG, was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the chemiluminescence reagent from Amersham. In the case of the N-terminal domain of Wzc tagged with six histidine residues, blots were revealed with the SuperSignal West HisProbe Kit from Pierce. Commercial protein markers and purified high molecular mass proteins such as laminine 1 (400 and 220 kDa in the presence of reducing agents) were used to calibrate SDS-PAGE.

https://openalex.org/W2062354480,"Estrogen receptors (ERα/ERβ) are expressed in neuronal cells and exhibit a variety of activities in the central nervous system. ER activity is regulated in a ligand-dependent manner and by co-regulatory factors. Caveolin-1 is a recently identified co-activator of ERα mediating the ligand-independent activation of this steroid receptor. Here the influence of ERs on caveolin expression in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells as well as in rodent brain was investigated. We found that ectopic expression of ERα in SK-N-MC cells (SK-ERα) leads to a ligand-independent transcriptional suppression of caveolin-1/-2 genes. This suppression is specifically mediated by ERα and not ERβ because ERβ counteracts the observed caveolin-silencing process. Interestingly, decreased caveolin expression in SK-ERα is accompanied by changes in the methylation pattern of caveolin promoters. The analysis of selected promoter regions of the human caveolin-1 gene showed that certain CpG dinucleotides were hypermethylated in SK-ERα cells, whereas the same sites were unmethylated in control, ERβ-, and ERα/β co-expressing SK-N-MC cells. Inhibition of DNA methylation or histone deacetylation led to partial re-expression of caveolin-1/-2 genes in SK-ERα. In vivo analysis revealed a down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression after long term estrogen exposure in certain regions of the mouse brain. In conclusion, we have shown for the first time that ERα and not ERβ silences caveolin-1/-2 expression in an epigenetic fashion in neuronal cells. The observed mechanism of gene silencing by ERα may have implications for the transcriptional regulation of further ERα target genes.

In addition to classical estrogen target tissues such as the female reproductive system (1Dryden G.L. Anderson J.N. Science. 1977; 197: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or bone tissue (2Manolagas S.C. Kousteni S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 2200-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), ERs are also expressed in the central nervous system and influence a variety of functions including locomotor activity, mood, memory, and cognition (3McEwen B.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 2785-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar,4Behl C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). To date, two structurally distinct subtypes of ERs, ERα (5Green S. Walter P. Kumar V. Krust A. Bornert J.M. Argos P. Chambon P. Nature. 1986; 320: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1961) Google Scholar) and ERβ (6Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar), have been identified. These receptors show the capability to form homo- or heterodimers (7Ogawa S. Inoue S. Watanabe T. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3505-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) ensuring a high level of complexity with respect to ER function. ERs exist as a protein complex assembled with a number of co-regulatory factors (8McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). The activity of ERs is regulated by the endogenous ligand estrogen and by interaction with co-repressors and co-activators. Co-repressors of ERs such as silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and nuclear receptor co-repressor have been shown to recruit histone deacetylases thereby mediating transcriptional repression. In contrast to co-repressors, co-activators enhance transcription of ER target genes in a ligand-dependent or -independent manner. Caveolin-1 has been recently identified as a co-activator exclusively of ERα (9Schlegel A. Wang C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33551-33556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ERα binds to caveolin-1 directly via its AF-1 domain, which subsequently leads to a estrogen-independent potentiation of ERE-driven gene transcription (10Schlegel A. Wang C. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is part of the caveolin gene family consisting of three members, caveolin-1, -2, and -3 (11Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In general, caveolin proteins play an important role in the biogenesis and function of caveolae (12Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane. Caveolae are presumed to integrate different signaling pathways as they are enriched in certain signaling proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor (13Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), H-Ras, Src family tyrosine kinase, heterotrimeric G-protein (14Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J.

Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22810-22814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Interaction of these proteins with caveolin suppresses their enzymatic activity by holding them in an inactive conformation. Recently, a putative membrane-bound form of ERα, which is thought to mediate the rapid non-genomic actions of ERs, was also found to be clustered in caveolae-like structures (16Toran-Allerand C.D. Singh M. Setalo Jr., G. Front Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 97-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Razandi M., Oh, P. Pedram A. Schnitzer J. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolae are involved in processes of vesicular trafficking, and particularly in the transport of cholesterol (18Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 19Ikonen E. Parton R.G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). There are some differences in the expression pattern of the caveolin isoforms. Although caveolin-3 expression is mainly restricted to muscle cells (20Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 were found to be abundant in other tissues, for example in adipocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (21Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). For a long time, caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 proteins were considered to be absent from neuronal tissue (22Gorodinsky A. Harris D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), but there is a growing body of evidence that caveolins exert their function also in the central nervous system (23Cameron P.L. Ruffin J.W. Bollag R. Rasmussen H. Cameron R.S. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9520-9535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ikezu T. Ueda H. Trapp B.D. Nishiyama K. Sha J.F. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Byrd A.L. Bassell G. Serizawa H. Lane W.S. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. Brain Res. 1998; 804: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that caveolin modulates the signaling through p75NTR and TrkA in neuronal and glial cell populations (25Bilderback T.R. Gazula V.R. Lisanti M.P. Dobrowsky R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and that caveolin might be involved in the induction of synaptic potentiation in hippocampal nerve cells (26Braun J.E. Madison D.V. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5997-6006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, caveolae may also have a pivotal role for the processing of amyloid precursor protein and generation of Aβ amyloid protein occurring in Alzheimer's disease (27Ikezu T. Trapp B.D. Song K.S. Schlegel A. Lisanti M.P. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10485-10495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Simons M. Keller P., De Strooper B. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Allinquant B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7640-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). From the evidence linking caveolin expression and ERα activation, ERα/estrogen may influence caveolin expression by means of an either synergistic or negative feedback regulation. Only a few studies have investigated changes in caveolin levels in response to ERs/estrogen in non-neuronal cells such as endothelial cells (30Pelligrino D.A., Ye, S. Tan F. Santizo R.A. Feinstein D.L. Wang Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), uterine smooth muscle cells (31Turi A. Kiss A.L. Mullner N. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and bovine aortic endothelial cells (32Jayachandran M. Hayashi T. Sumi D. Iguchi A. Miller V.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1327-H1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we addressed the question whether ERs/estrogen affect caveolin expression in neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo focusing also on differences between ER subtypes and regulatory mechanisms. Human SK-N-MC cells (ATCC HTB-10) were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection and were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). The medium for the SK-N-MC transfectants was supplemented with 2 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem). Construction and characterization of SK-N-MC cells stably transfected with wild type human estrogen receptor α (ERα) were described previously (33Manthey D. Heck S. Engert S. Behl C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4285-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human cDNA of ERα (34Wrenn C.K. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24089-24098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into the bicistronic eukaryotic expression vector pIRES (CLONTECH, BD Biosciences). For generation of the human estrogen receptor β (ERβ) expression vector, ERβ cDNA (7Ogawa S. Inoue S. Watanabe T. Orimo A. Hosoi T. Ouchi Y. Muramatsu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3505-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) was ligated into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). This construct (ERβ/pBluescript II KS) was double-digested with XhoI/XbaI liberating an ∼2-kb fragment that encodes the ERβ cDNA. Subsequently, the fragment was ligated into the XhoI/XbaI double-digested vector pIRES. In the case of co-expression of ERα and ERβ, cDNA of ERα was ligated into the SalI restriction site of the MCS B of pIRES. TheXhoI/BssHII ERβ fragment derived from ERβ/pBluescript II KS was ligated into theXhoI/MluI opened MCS A of pIRES. The orientation of insertions as well as sequences of ERα/β cDNAs were checked by sequencing (TopLab, Munich, Germany) in both directions before transfecting the cells. A mock transfection with the empty vector was performed as a control. SK-N-MC cells were transfected with 2 μg of the ERα, ERβ, ERα/β expression vectors, using SuperfectTMTransfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Twenty four hours after transfection, 2 μg/ml G418 was added to the medium. Clones were picked after 3 weeks and grown under selective conditions. The clones were analyzed by RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of SK-N-MC-cells with the reporter plasmid ERE-Luc was performed using the Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Briefly, cells were seeded in 24-well plates in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS (HyClone, Perbio Science) 24 h before transfection. When cells reached 60% confluency, each well received 1 μg of reporter plasmid, and cells were stimulated with 10 nm 17β-estradiol (Sigma, diluted in 100% ethanol). After 72 h of estrogen treatment, cells were incubated for 5 min at room temperature with lysis buffer (K2HPO4, Triton), and lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (35Moosmann B. Behl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8867-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined by a standard BCA protein assay (Pierce), and luminescence readings were performed with an automatic counter (Wallac Victor, Wallac Inc.). Total RNA from the cells was prepared using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Reverse transcription was performed on 2 μg of total RNA in a reaction volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of 10× reverse transcriptase buffer (Qiagen), 2 μl of 5 mm dNTP (Qiagen), 2 μl of 10 μmoligo(dT)23 primer (Sigma), 10 units of RNasin (Promega), and 4 units of Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen). Synthesis of cDNA was carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. A mock control without reverse transcriptase was performed for each RT-PCR in order to exclude DNA contamination. PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction volume that contains 1–4 μl of cDNA, 2.5 μl of 10× PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 0.75 μl of 50 mm MgCl2(Invitrogen), 0.5 μl of 10 mm dNTPs (peqLAB), 0.5 μl of 15 pmol sense and antisense primers, and 0.5 units of DNATaq polymerase (Invitrogen). The sequences of PCR primers for the amplification of caveolin-1 cDNA were 5′-GACTTTGAAGATGTGATTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGATGGAATAGACACGGCTG-3′ (antisense). This primer pair amplified a 254-bp product, corresponding to a part of exon 3 within the human caveolin-1 cDNA. Caveolin-2 cDNA was amplified with use of the sense primer 5′-GACGTACAGCTCTTCATGGAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGCTGACAGAAGAGAAGCATC-3′, resulting in a 446-bp PCR product. The following primers were used for the detection of ERα transcripts: sense 5′-AGATCTTCGACATGCTGCTG-3′ and antisense 5′-CACTTCATGCTGTACAGATG-3′, this primer set amplified a 323-bp product within the ERα steroid binding domain. The primer pair 5′-GAGGCCTCCATGATGATGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCCAGCAGCAGGTCAT-AC-3′ (antisense) was used for detection of ERβ mRNA and generated a 611-bp product corresponding to a part of the ERβ steroid binding domain. Primers for β-actin were used as control for the quantity of the RNA used. The β-actin-specific primers amplified a 275-bp product and were composed of the following sequences: 5′-CTACAATGAGCTGCGTGTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGTCCAGACGCAGGATGGC-3′ (antisense). All primers were purchased from Metabion (Martinsried, Germany). PCR cycle conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 58 or 61 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s for 25–30 cycles with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were fractionated by size on agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Caveolin-1, caveolin-2, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ERK1/2, as well as actin expression was examined by Western blot analysis. Cells from subconfluent 6- or 10-cm diameter dishes were washed with PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml, and aprotinin, 1 μg/ml). Samples were briefly sonicated and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Prior to loading, the protein concentration of the samples was measured with the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The samples were adjusted to loading buffer (10% SDS, 20% glycerin, 125 mm Tris, 1.0 mmEDTA, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), denatured by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Protein bands were visualized with Ponceau S to verify equal loading of samples. Blots were placed in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween) supplemented with 2.5% non-fat milk for 1.5 h at room temperature and then incubated with either anti-caveolin-1 (1:500, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-caveolin-2 (1:250, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-ERK1/2 (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated form; 1:1000, New England Biolabs) diluted in TBS/Tween, overnight at 4 °C. After washing the blots three times with TBS/Tween, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:3000, AmershamBiosciences) for 1.5 h and washed again as described previously. Membrane-bound secondary antibodies were detected using the ECL procedure developed by Amersham Biosciences. To ensure equal protein loading membranes were re-hybridized with an actin-specific antibody and developed. Cells grown on glass coverslips were briefly washed two times with PBS and fixed at room temperature for 45 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Cells were permeabilized by rinsing two times (10 min) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After permeabilization cells were rinsed in blocking solution (10% FBS in PBS) for 30 min. The coverslips were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either caveolin-1 or caveolin-2 primary antibody (1:250 in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% FBS). After three washes with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3, Dianova, diluted 1:200 in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 and 10% FBS). Finally, cells were washed three times for 5 min in PBS, 0.01% Tween 20, and slides were mounted with Prolong Antifade® (Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica confocal laser scanning microscope TCS NT) and digitally photographed. Cells were grown to low density 24 h before treatment and then switched to culture medium supplemented with 10, 50, and 100 μm5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-AZA; Sigma, diluted in acidic PBS), or cells were treated with PBS vehicle. The medium was replaced with fresh medium containing fresh 5-AZA every 24 h. In a separate experiment trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma, diluted in 100% ethanol) was added to the medium at a final concentration of 15 and 20 ng/ml, or cells were treated with the vehicle ethanol. Treatment of SK-ERα cells with 1, 5, and 10 μm U0126 (Calbiochem, diluted in Me2SO) was performed in the presence of phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS. RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit (Stratagene) after 4 days of 5-AZA, 2 days of TSA, or 3 days of U0126 treatment. Genomic DNA was isolated from cells using the Blood and Cell Culture DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The bisulfite reaction was performed using the CpG Genome Modification Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Intergen). In each bisulfite reaction, 1 μg of DNA was used initially. The DNA was ultimately eluted in 30 μl of TE. Each PCR contained 5 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA in a final volume of 50 μl of PCR mixture composed of 5 μl of 10× PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 1.5 μl of 50 mm MgCl2(Invitrogen), 1 μl of 10 mm of each dNTP (peqLAB), 1 μl of each 100-pmol primer, and 4 units of DNA Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The first set of primers was designed after taking into account the bisulfite conversion reaction. Primer sequences were as follows: cav1prom1s (−877 → −848) 5′-tgtgtattttgtaaatatggtataatttg-3′ (sense) and cav1prom1as (−547 → −525) 5′-CCATCTCTACCTTAAAACACAT-3′ (antisense). The second pair of primer was cav1prom3s (−477 → −455) 5′-GGATAGGGTAGGATTGTGGATT-3′ (sense) and cav1prom3as (−223 → −202) 5′-CACATCCCCAAAATTCTAACA-3′ (antisense) (36Cui J. Rohr L.R. Swanson G. Speights V.O. Maxwell T. Brothman A.R. Prostate. 2001; 46: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The nucleotide positions are numbered relative to translation start codon (+1). PCR was performed at 95 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 50 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The amplified fragments were gel-purified and subcloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). Plasmids were purified using the QIAprep Spin MiniPrep Kit (Qiagen), and individual clones were sequenced by TopLab (Martinsried, Germany). In addition, amplified fragments derived from primer set cav1prom3s/3as were directly sequenced with use of the corresponding primers. After modification, unmethylated cytosines appear as thymidines, whereas methylated cytosines remain unchanged. Pregnant C57B16/J mice were injected with vehicle or 1 μg/kg body weight of estradiol diproprionate daily from embryonic day 9.5–16.5. The pups were born, weaned, and sacrificed at 4 weeks of age. The brain was removed and frozen in isopentane on dry ice. Using a cryostat, 16-μm serial sections were taken and mounted directly onto Superfrost plus microscope slides and stored at −80 °C until processed. Sections were removed from the freezer and allowed to defrost at room temperature for 5 min. The sections were then fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) followed by permeabilization in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST). Background staining was minimalized by incubating the sections in 50% (v/v) ethanol, 0.9 (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity 0.9% followed by 4% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. A 1:100 dilution of the anti-caveolin-1 antibody was added to the slides and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After removing unbound antibody with PBST washes, immunoreactivity was detected with a biotinylated secondary antibody followed by an avidin-horseradish peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vectastain). Immunoreactivity was visualized using a diaminobenzidine staining kit (Vectastain) for ∼2 min. The reaction was terminated by dilution with water, and the sections were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped. Immunoreactivity was assessed in various brain regions by a person blind to the treatment of the mice. Quantitation of U0126 inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as restoration of caveolin-1 transcription in SK-ERα cells was performed by measuring the optical density of bands using the scion imaging software program (Scion Corp.). We examined the putative relationship between caveolin-1/-2 and ERα/β expression in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells in vitro. The SK-N-MC cell line has been demonstrated previously (33Manthey D. Heck S. Engert S. Behl C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4285-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to lack functional ERα and ERβ involved in ERE-mediated transcription. Therefore, expression vectors encoding wild type ERα and ERβ were stably transfected into SK-N-MC cells and subsequently characterized concerning the estrogen receptor status by RT-PCR analysis and luciferase assay. SK-N-MC cells overexpressing ERα cDNA, ERβ cDNA, or co-expressing ERα/β were named SK-ERα, SK-ERβ, or SK-ERα/β, respectively. Mock-transfected SK-N-MC cells were named SK01 and served as a control. There were no ERα and ERβ mRNA transcripts detectable in SK01 cells after performing 25 PCR cycles as shown by RT-PCR (Fig.1). RT-PCR analysis of SK-ERα cells and SK-ERα/β cells for ERα transcripts exhibited a specific band of the expected size using ERα-specific primers. Primer annealing sites are located within the steroid binding domain of the ERα cDNA. ERβ-mRNA transcripts were detected in ERβ-overexpressing cells (SK-ERβ) as well as in the SK-ERα/β double-transfectants using primers specific for a part of the steroid binding domain of ERβ cDNA. Taken together, we demonstrated that the corresponding receptor isoforms are transcriptionally expressed in the analyzed ER transfectants. By employing an established luciferase-based reporter system (35Moosmann B. Behl C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8867-8872Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we tested the functional activity of the transfected ERα/β expression plasmids. The luciferase reporter plasmid contains 3 EREs linked to luciferase cDNA. When stimulating the cells with estrogen for 24 h, we observed a pronounced increase (∼250–600-fold) in ERα and ERβ activity in the ER transfectants but not in the mock-transfected SK01 control cells. We next evaluated whether ER signaling is sensitive to the ER antagonist ICI 182 780. For this purpose we treated cells with ICI in the absence or presence of estrogen. The ER inhibitor ICI clearly abrogated the ERα/β activity in the ER transfectants when applied in combination with estrogen (data not shown). In this study we demonstrated that SK-N-MC cells express high levels of caveolin-1/-2 unlike most other previously analyzed neuroblastoma cell lines. Western blot analysis of cellular lysates derived from SK01 or ER-transfected SK-N-MC cells (SK-ERα, SK-ERβ, and SK-ERα/β) showed that the ectopic expression of ERα in SK-ERα cells led to a nearly complete abrogation of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 expression (Fig.2 A). Unexpectedly, the observed effect occurred in a ligand-independent manner because there were no caveolin-1/-2 isoforms detectable in estrogen-untreated SK-ERα cells. In contrast, ERβ-overexpressing cells (SK-ERβ) as well as ERα/β-co-expressing cells (SK-ERα/β) exhibited high amounts of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 proteins similar to caveolin-1/-2 levels in SK01 cells. Estrogen treatment of SK01, SK-ERβ, and SK-ERα/β cells for 8–48 h did not markedly alter caveolin-1/-2 expression. Results derived from Western blot analysis were confirmed by cellular immunofluorescence using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Caveolin immunostaining in estrogen-untreated SK01 and SK-ERβ cells was characterized by the punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm and the predominant location of the proteins at the cell membrane (Fig.2 B). Although SK01 control cells and ERβ-overexpressing cells (SK-ERβ) showed strong signals for both caveolin isoforms, ERα-overexpressing cells (SK-ERα) exhibited almost no detectable levels of caveolin-1/-2 proteins. The loss of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 proteins might prevent the formation of caveolae in SK-ERα cells as it has been described for K562 cells lacking endogenous levels of caveolin-1 proteins (37Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Galbiati F. Rizzo G. Grignani F. Engelman J.A. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Scherer P.E. Mora R. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Peschle C. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25718-25725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). We further examined by RT-PCR analysis whether the down-regulation of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 expression is mediated at a transcriptional level. RT-PCR performed with 25 cycles produced a very faint amplification for caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 transcripts when using total RNA derived from estrogen-treated (8–48 h) and -untreated SK-ERα cells (Fig. 2 C). On the other hand, caveolin-1- and caveolin-2-specific primers amplified a prominent band when applying total RNA of SK01, SK-ERβ, or SK-ERα/β cells to RT-PCR. We observed no effect of estrogen treatment on the regulation of caveolin-1/-2 transcription in SK01, SK-ERβ, and SK-ERα/β cells. The results indicate an ERα-mediated ligand-independent repression of caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 transcripti"
https://openalex.org/W2155091686,"The x-ray structure of the unactivated kinase domain of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGFRK-0P) is reported here at 2.7 Å resolution. IGFRK-0P is composed of two lobes connected by a hinge region. The N-terminal lobe of the kinase is a twisted β-sheet flanked by a single helix, and the C-terminal lobe comprises eight α-helices and four short β-strands. The ATP binding pocket and the catalytic center reside at the interface of the two lobes. Despite the overall similarity to other receptor tyrosine kinases, three notable conformational modifications are observed: 1) this kinase adopts a more closed structure, with its two lobes rotated further toward each other; 2) the conformation of the proximal end of the activation loop (residues 1121–1129) is different; 3) the orientation of the nucleotide-binding loop is altered. Collectively, these alterations lead to a different ATP-binding pocket that might impact on inhibitor designs for IGFRK-0P. Two molecules of IGFRK-0P are seen in the asymmetric unit; they are associated as a dimer with their ATP binding clefts facing each other. The ordered N terminus of one monomer approaches the active site of the other, suggesting that the juxtamembrane region of one molecule could come into close proximity to the active site of the other."

Chem. 1999; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). There are probably different binding sites on SR-BI. HDL compete for the binding of LDL to SR-BI but LDL poorly inhibit the binding of HDL, and there is no reciprocal cross-competition between these two ligands (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 8Freeman M. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The study of several mutants of SR-BI also supports for the proposal that the interaction of SR-BI with HDL differs from that with LDL (9Gu X. Lawrence R. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9120-9130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins (apo) AI, AII, and CIII of HDL either associated with lipids or in lipid free forms can directly mediate their binding to SR-BI (10Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Williams et al. (11Williams D.L. Llera-Moya M. Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SR-BI can interact with multiple sites in apoAI and identified the Class A amphipathic α-helix as a recognition motif. The specific role of apoAI in the delivery of cholesterol to adrenal cells was clearly demonstrated in mice deficient either in apoAI or apoAII (12Plump A.S. Erickson S.K. Weng W. Partin J.S. Breslow J.L. Williams D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated, in a human adrenal cell line, that apoAII, which binds SR-BI with high affinity, can act as an antagonist of apoAI in CE-HDL uptake (13Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). ApoE is a constituent of trigyceride-rich lipoproteins and is essential for the receptor-mediated uptake of their remnants (14Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) and for their catabolism by pathways involving heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (15Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoE deficiency in mice leads to impaired catabolism of these remnants and increased atherosclerotic lesions (for review, see Ref. 16Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 495-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Direct interaction of apoE with SR-BI has never been demonstrated, and its implication in CE uptake is still controversial. It was previously shown that HDL binds murine SR-BI (1Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), human SR-BI (4Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2341-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and human CD 36 (2) independently of the removal of apoE by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (for review, see Ref. 17Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These results clearly demonstrated that HDL binding can occur with high affinity in the absence of apoE. Different results, obtained before the description of SR-BI as an HDL receptor, implicated cellular apoE in enhancing HDL binding to cells and CE uptake from HDL. Selective uptake of CE by HepG2 cells was reduced by antibodies directed against the receptor binding domain of apoE (18Leblond L. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1670-1676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of apoE on CE uptake was not due to the transfer of apoE to HDL or to the LDL-receptor pathway. Inversely, Jiet al. (19Ji Z.S. Dichek H.L. Miranda R.D. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31285-31292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) demonstrated, in cultured hepatocytes, that if apoE (in apoE-enriched HDL) enhanced the uptake of HDL particles, it had little effect on the selective uptake of CE-HDL. Similar results were described by Rinninger et al. (20Rinninger F. Greten H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More recent studies demonstrated that apoE expression by mouse adrenocortical cells increased both endocytic and selective uptake of CE-LDL but had little influence on CE uptake from HDL (21Swarnakar S. Reyland M.E. Deng J. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12140-12147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Basal CE-selective uptake could be observed in the absence of secreted apoE but was enhanced by the apoE synthesis. In vivo studies in mice deficient in apoE cannot determine the importance of apoE in CE-selective clearance. Different authors suggest that in mice lacking apoE, selective uptake of CE from remnant lipoproteins is not impaired, but occurs probably via SR-BI and could be facilitated by hepatic lipase (HL) (22Amar M.J. Dugi K.A. Haudenschild C.C. Shamburek R.D. Foger B. Chase M. Bensadoun A. Hoyt Jr., R.F. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J.

Huszar D. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have shown that CE-HDL clearance by the liver is profoundly impaired in apoE-deficient mice and is not compensated by a natural increase in SR-BI expression. Moreover, the decrease in SR-BI does not change the HDL profile in apoE-deficient mice with attenuated mutation of SR-BI. Arai et al. (24Arai T. Rinninger F. Varban L. Fairchild-Huntress V. Liang C.P. Chen W. Seo T. Deckelbaum R. Huszar D. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12050-12055Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggest that apoE could play a major role in the selective clearance of CE-HDL by the liver by facilitating the presentation of HDL to SR-BI at the cell surface. In this paper, we have examined the role of apoE, free or associated with lipids, in binding to SR-BI and in selective CE uptake from lipoproteins to cells. We used a human adrenal cell line, which naturally expresses a high level of SR-BI and where SR-BI is the major HDL-binding protein (13Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These cells do not secrete apoE, and we wanted to determine whether apoE can have direct interaction with SR-BI either free or associated with lipids in reconstituted proteoliposomes or in lipoproteins. We have demonstrated that free apoE competes with high affinity with reconstituted HDL, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-l-phosphatidylcholine-apoAI (POPC-AI), in binding to cells. But when associated with phospholipids in 1,2-dipalmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine-apoE (DPPC-E), apoE fails to compete with POPC-AI. The presence of apoE in lipoproteins, naturally or by in vitro incubation with high apoE concentrations, does not modify binding and selective uptake of CE by cells in conditions where the LDL receptor pathway is inhibited. However, the addition of small amounts of apoE3 to cells, in the presence of lipoproteins devoid of apoE, leads to a 2-fold increase in CE-selective uptake by cells. In these experimental conditions, apoE does not bind to lipoproteins, and we suggest that direct interaction of apoE with SR-BI, in the same site as the POPC-AI binding site, even if it is not necessary for selective uptake, could modify the SR-BI structure in cell membranes and facilitate CE uptake. POPC and DPPC were obtained from Sigma. Cell culture medium was from Invitrogen. Transferrin, selenium, and insulin (ITS) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). [125I]Iodine, [1α,2α(n)-3H]cholesteryl oleate ([3H]CE) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against apoE were mouse monoclonal and sheep polyclonal antibodies (homemade (25Leroy A., Vu- Dac N. Koffigan M. Clavey V. Fruchart J.C. J. Immunoassay. 1988; 9: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Sanofi Diagnostic Pasteur. Recombinant human apoE isoforms E2, E3, and E4 were obtained and purified as described previously (26Barbier A. Visvikis A. Mathieu F. Diez L. Havekes L.M. Siest G. Eur. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1997; 35: 581-589PubMed Google Scholar). Human apoE3 was purified from human plasma VLDL of hypertriglyceridemic individuals as previously described by Rall et al. (27Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thrombin (human α-thrombin) was from Biovalley (Marne La Vallée, France). Human adrenocortical carcinoma cells NCI-H295R (CRL-2128) were obtained from ATCC and were routinely propagated in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, ITS, hydroxycortisone, 17-β-estradiol (both at 10−8m) as described previously (28Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). LDL and high density lipoprotein fractions 2 and 3 (HDL2 and HDL3) were prepared from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, respectively, at density 1.030 g/ml <d < 1.053 g/ml, 1.063 g/ml < d< 1.12 g/ml, and 1.12 g/ml < d < 1.21 g/ml (29Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). HDL2 were purified on heparin-Sepharose column (30Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to obtain an apoE free unretained HDL2 fraction. Lack of apoE in HDL3 and in apoE free unretained HDL2fraction was tested by ELISA (25Leroy A., Vu- Dac N. Koffigan M. Clavey V. Fruchart J.C. J. Immunoassay. 1988; 9: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). VLDL from cholesterol-fed rabbits or from apoE-deficient mouse serum were prepared by ultracentrifugation at density 1.006 g/ml. In some experiments, lipoproteins devoid of apoE were enriched with human recombinant apoE as described previously in a 0.6/1 (w/w) ratio (31Clavey V. Lestavel-Delattre S. Copin C. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, concentrated lipoproteins (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with recombinant apoE3 (0.3 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and then diluted for incubation with cells. In these conditions nearly all apoE3 remains associated with lipoproteins. In the experiments indicated lipoproteins were reisolated by ultracentrifugation at the appropriate density to remove free apoE3. When the lipoproteins were labeled for binding or CE-selective uptake experiments, apoE3 enrichment was performed after labeling. POPC-AI and POPC-E3 were prepared by the cholate dialysis method (32Jonas A. Kezdy K.E. Wald J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4818-4824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Jonas A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 553-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) at a lipid/apolipoprotein ratio of 100/1 (mole/mole). DPPC-E complexes (100/1) were prepared according to Jolivalt et al. (34Jolivalt C. Leininger-Muller B. Bertrand P. Herber R. Christen Y. Siest G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The functionality of the DPPC-E3 and DDPC-E4 preparations was verified by their capacity to inhibit 125I-LDL binding on cultured fibroblasts when DPPC-E2 poorly compete with LDL (not shown). For selective CE uptake experiments, POPC/apoAI/CE, POPC/apoE3/CE, and DPPC/apoE3/CE, containing phospholipids (PL), apolipoprotein, CE in a molar ratio of 100/1/0.3, and trace amounts of [3H]CE, were prepared as described (35Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43801-43808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Native lipoproteins (1 mg) were labeled with [3H]CE as described previously (27Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The final specific activities varied between 45 and 400 dpm/ng of cholesterol. Lipoproteins (native or reconstituted) were labeled in protein moiety with [125I]iodine using the iodine monochloride method (36Bilheimer D.W. Eisenberg S. Levy R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar). The final specific activities varied between 400 and 1500 dpm/ng of protein. Cells cultured in 12-well plates were washed and preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM/F-12 serum-free medium. For direct binding, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 125I-labeled lipoproteins without (total binding) or with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled lipoproteins (nonspecific binding). Cells were then washed and dissolved with 1 mol/liter NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was counted. An aliquot was used to quantify cellular proteins (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as nanograms of bound or degraded proteins per milligrams of cellular proteins. Specific binding was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific binding. Competition studies were performed with 125I-POPC-AI at 2 μg/ml and increasing concentrations of the different unlabeled apolipoproteins or lipoproteins for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were preincubated, washed, and then counted as in direct binding studies. Results were expressed as a percentage of the binding measured without competitor. In the experiments indicated, binding studies were performed in the presence of 50 μm chlorpromazine to inhibit endocytosis by coated pit pathway (38Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 12-well plates were washed and preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM/F-12 serum-free medium. They were then washed and incubated for the indicated times with [3H]CE-labeled lipoproteins without (total uptake) or with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled HDL (nonspecific uptake). Cells were then washed and dissolved with 1 mol/liter NaOH, and cell-associated radioactivity was counted. An aliquot was used to quantify cellular proteins (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as nanograms or milligrams of cholesterol incorporated per milligram of cellular proteins. In the experiments indicated, CE-selective uptake studies were performed in the presence of 50 μm chlorpromazine to inhibit endocytosis (38Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). To measure the effect of direct interaction of apoE3 with cells, cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM/F-12 serum-free medium with 10 μg/ml (or the indicated concentrations) of apoE3. In some experiments apoE3 (100 μg) was pretreated with thrombin (2 μg) in 100 mm bicarbonate buffer for 24 h as described previously by Bradley et al. (39Bradley W.A. Gilliam E.B. Gotto Jr., A.M. Gianturco S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 109: 1360-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Gianturco S.H. Gotto Jr., A.M. Hwang S.L. Karlin J.B. Lin A.H. Prasad S.C. Bradley W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency of the cleavage of recombinant apoE3 (40 kDa) was verified by the presence of two major fragments (10-kDa C-terminal fragment and 26-kDa N-terminal fragment) after SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions. To inhibit proteoglycan synthesis, cells were preincubated for 20 h with 1 mm p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (β-d-xyloside), a general inhibitor of proteoglycan synthesis (41Swarnakar S. Temel R.E. Connelly M.A. Azhar S. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29733-29739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and during the lipoprotein uptake assay. The effect of β-d-xyloside on glycosaminoglycan synthesis was measured by simultaneous incubation of cells with Na235SO4 (20 μCi/ml) (42Burgess J.W. Liang P. Vaidyanath C. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 43Maurer A.M. Han Z.C. Dhermy D. Briere J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 127: 382-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After incubation cells were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline and cells were then solubilized with 1 m NaOH or were incubated with 12.5 μg/ml trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm EDTA for 15 mn at 37 °C to release cell surface proteoglycans. Total cells and trypsin-released materials were counted for 35S incorporation. The decrease by 24 ± 5% of Na235SO4 incorporation in cells and of 49 ± 11% in cell surface trypsin-released materials demonstrates that their proteoglycan content was effectively decreased during xyloside incubation. We previously demonstrated that reconstituted HDL, POPC-AI, bind to NCI-H295R adrenal cells by direct interaction with SR-BI, which was the major if not the unique receptor for these ligands (13Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Among the tested ligands, POPC-AI had the highest affinity for SR-BI. We wanted to know if apoE was a ligand for SR-BI. We first analyzed the competition of apoE with POPC-AI to bind to SR-BI. In Fig.1 A we can see that free apoE competes with 125I-POPC-AI. There is no significant difference between the recombinant apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 isoforms, but their affinity for SR-BI was slightly lower than free apoAI. In the conditions used for competition experiments, apoE did not displace125I-apoAI from 125I-POPC-AI, since more than 95% of 125I-apoAI can be reisolated in POPC-AI by ultracentrifugation at d > 1.21 g/ml (not shown). We then studied the competition of free apoE3 with other lipoproteins, which are also ligands of SR-BI, and we showed that free apoE failed to compete efficiently with native 125I-lipoproteins (HDL3, LDL, or VLDL) (Fig. 1 B). After incubation with cells in the presence of apoE,125I-POPC-AI and 125I-lipoproteins were reisolated by ultracentrifugation at d = 1.21 g/ml and the apoE content of the different fractions was measured by ELISA (25Leroy A., Vu- Dac N. Koffigan M. Clavey V. Fruchart J.C. J. Immunoassay. 1988; 9: 309-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For 125I-lipoproteins, the main part of apoE was found in the bottom (>90%) but during the competition with125I-POPC-AI, for higher apoE concentrations, a part of apoE was found in the top, indicating a partial apoE association with lipids. We then reconstituted lipoproteins, DPPC-E and POPC-E complexes, to evaluate the role of lipids in the interaction of apoE with SR-BI, and we studied the competition between these complexes and POPC-AI. As shown in Fig. 2, DPPC-E poorly competes with 125I-POPC-AI to bind to SR-BI. There is no difference between the different apoE isoforms. POPC-E3 also fails to compete with125I-POPC-AI. In a control experiment, competition for the binding of 125I-POPC-AI by DPPC-AI was lower than POPC-AI but much greater than DPPC-E. We then wanted to evaluate the effect of apoE, free or associated to lipids, on the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL. To inhibit the LDL-receptor pathway, the selective uptake experiments were performed in the presence of chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of endocytosis (38Wang L.H. Rothberg K.G. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). We incubated cells with free apoE3, then measured the selective CE uptake from [3H]CE-lipoproteins to cells. Chlorpromazine does not modify selective uptake from apoE3 free lipoproteins (not shown). Surprisingly, we can see in Fig.3 that the presence of free apoE3 in the culture medium increases 2–3-fold the selective CE uptake mediated by SR-BI from human [3H]CE-HDL3 (Fig.3 A) or from [3H]CE-VLDL prepared from apoE-deficient mice (Fig. 3 B). We verified that human plasma apoE3 has the same stimulating effect that the recombinant peptide (not shown). This effect was not obtained with free apoAI (Fig. 3,A and B), which, at higher concentrations, plays a competitive role in the selective uptake process (13Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The DPPC-E preparation (Fig. 3 A) fails to inhibit or enhance CE-selective uptake from HDL instead of POPC-AI, which strongly inhibits selective uptake from HDL as found previously (13Pilon A. Briand O. Lestavel S. Copin C. Majd Z. Fruchart J.C. Castro G. Clavey V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Since apoE interaction with lipids in lipoproteins is not required to stimulate selective uptake from HDL, it was interesting to determine whether the N-terminal fragment of apoE was sufficient to elicit effect on SR-BI-mediated selective CE uptake. We incubated apoE3 with thrombin for 24 h as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” apoE3 was cleaved in two major fragments as verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 B). Digested apoE3 failed to enhance [3H]CE-HDL-selective uptake, whereas in the same experiment apoE3 increased uptake by 2.8 (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the positive effect of apoE3 on the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters could be dependent on the direct interaction of free apoE with SR-BI. However to exclude that the effect of free apoE3 could be mediated by the interaction of apoE3 with the [3H]CE-lipoproteins, after the selective uptake experiments, we reisolated lipoproteins from the cell culture medium by ultracentrifugation at d > 1.21, and we found less than 8% of apoE associated with lipoproteins isolated at the top (measured by ELISA). Despite former results, which suggest that only free apoE can have a competitive role in rHDL binding and an enhancing role in CE-lipoprotein uptake, we investigated whether the presence of apoE in lipoproteins had an influence on CE-selective uptake. For this purpose, we prepared lipoproteins naturally containing apoE and compared them with lipoproteins devoid of apoE. We compared [3H]CE-selective uptake from total human HDL2(1.063 < d < 1.12 g/liter) and from the fraction of human HDL2 not retained on the heparin-Sepharose column (free apoE HDL2). Fig. 5 does not show any difference between these two HDL subfractions either for competition with 125I-POPC-AI (Fig. 5 A) or for direct CE-selective uptake from these lipoproteins (Fig.5 B). We then prepared VLDL from rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich diet. These VLDL were apoE-rich, but the apoE content depends on the duration of the cholesterol-rich diet (40Gianturco S.H. Gotto Jr., A.M. Hwang S.L. Karlin J.B. Lin A.H. Prasad S.C. Bradley W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4526-4533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We obtained three VLDL preparations with increasing apoE content. After labeling, [3H]CE-selective uptake from these different VLDL preparations was measured, and no difference in CE-selective uptake was observed (Fig. 6). However, lipoproteins containing apoE and devoid of apoE are often found to be also different as regards to their lipid composition, and this could modify per se the CE-selective uptake (44Collet X. Tall A.R. Serajuddin H. Guendouzi K. Royer L. Oliveira H. Barbaras R. Jiang X.C. Francone O.L. J.

We then artificially prepared apoE-enriched VLDL and HDL3 by the method described previously (31Clavey V. Lestavel-Delattre S. Copin C. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Res. 2001; 50: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). STAT6 becomes activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13 and mediates most of the gene expression regulated by these cytokines. IL-4 regulates immune and anti-inflammatory responses. It promotes the differentiation of T helper (Th) precursors toward the Th2 lineage while inhibiting Th1 development. Furthermore, IL-4 triggers immunoglobulin class switching to the IgE isotype in B-cells. STAT6-deficient mice have defects in IL-4-mediated Th2 development and immunoglobulin class switching to IgE, demonstrating the essential role of STAT6 in these functions (5Shimoda K. van Deursen J.

Eotaxin-3 is a member of the family of CC chemokines, which are known to be potent chemoattractants for eosinophils. A STAT6-response element was identified in the promoter of the eotaxin-3 gene, characterizing this chemokine as a novel STAT6 target gene (8Hoeck J. Woisetschlager M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3216-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Control of gene expression is a dynamic and complex process. Gene transcription involves assembly of multiple transcription factors at the distal enhancer region and the basal transcriptional machinery, including RNA polymerase II, at the core promoter of target genes (9Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). According to the current model, gene expression involves the sequential assembly of an array of coregulatory proteins, including coactivators that are part of the chromatin-modifying complexes, possessing histone acetyltransferase activities (10Chen H. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Coactivator complexes are recruited via specific protein/protein interactions, often mediated by specific interaction motifs in the transactivation domains of DNA-bound transcription factors or other coactivators.The transactivation domain (TAD) of STAT6 was characterized as a modular, proline-rich region in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (11Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar, 12Moriggl R. Berchtold S. Friedrich K. Standke G.J. Kammer W. Heim M. Wissler M. Stocklin E. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3663-3678Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Two distinct transactivation functions, which cooperate in transcriptional activation, have been mapped to this domain (13Goenka S. Youn J. Dzurek L.M. Schindler U., Yu- Lee L.Y. Boothby M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4663-4672PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies we reported that STAT6 recruits the coactivators p300/CBP and NCoA-1 via direct interaction with specific parts of its transactivation domain (14Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol.

Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). p300/CBP function as coactivators for many DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins, including nuclear receptors and other signal-regulated activators (17Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13505-13508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). p300/CBP have been shown to associate with other coactivators such as p/CAF (18Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V.

Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar) and members of the NCoA coactivator family also called the p160/steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family (19Kamei Y., Xu, L.

The NCoA coactivators were identified as nuclear receptor-binding proteins, which enhance transcriptional activation by ligand-induced transcription factors (21Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr.

Subsequently a number of transcription factors have been shown to recruit these coactivators. It has been proposed that distinct classes of transcription factors selectively use specific coactivators and histone acetyltransferase activities for their function (28Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W., Xu, L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 29Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C., Xu, L. Torchia J. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Science. 1998; 279: 700-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, we have observed a specific role of NCoA-1, but not NCoA-2 or NCoA-3, for STAT6-mediated transactivation (15Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Only NCoA-1 acts as a coactivator of STAT6. STAT6 directly contacts NCoA-1 via a small carboxyl-terminal part of its transactivation domain. A region between amino acids 213–462 in NCoA-1, which comprises the B part of the Per-Arnt-Sim domain and part of a serine/threonine region, mediates the interaction with STAT6. Overexpression of the STAT6-interacting domain of NCoA-1 inhibits transactivation by STAT6 in a transdominant manner, demonstrating the importance of NCoA-1 for STAT6 transactivation. In the present study we characterize the 56-amino acid spanning interaction domain in the STAT6-TAD that mediates the recruitment of NCoA-1. We have identified an LXXLL motif (where L is leucine and X is any amino acid) with a predicted α-helical structure in the shortest NCoA-1-interacting fragment of the STAT6-TAD. The α-helical LXXLL motif was originally found in a variety of coactivators, e.g. NCoA/p160/SRC members, p300/CBP, RIP-140. It is described as a signature motif, which mediates the recruitment of these proteins by the nuclear hormone receptors (30McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 31Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Specific LXXLL motifs of NCoAs mediate the ligand-dependent interaction with nuclear receptors, as well as interaction with p300/CBP. In this study we demonstrate that STAT6 recruits NCoA-1 via an LXXLL motif in its transactivation domain. We show that a peptide containing the LXXLL motif of STAT6, as well as antibodies raised against this peptide, are potent inhibitors of the interaction with NCoA-1in vitro. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the STAT6-LXXLL motif abolishes the binding of NCoA-1 in vitro and in vivo. A STAT6 variant, in which the LXXLL motif is mutated, is less active in induction of a STAT6-dependent reporter gene. Moreover, the LXXLL mutant of STAT6 shows impaired induction of eotaxin-3 expression, indicating that recruitment of NCoA-1 by the STAT6-LXXLL motif is essential for full transactivation of this endogenous target gene. The LXXLL motif of STAT6 shows no sequence homology to the known coactivator motifs. A peptide containing the STAT6-LXXLL motif does not interfere with nuclear receptor/coactivator interactions, suggesting that this motif might represent a specific target for STAT6 inhibition. Our data indicate that NCoA-1 does not only use its own LXXLL motifs to contact DNA-bound factors and coactivators, but can also be recruited itself by an LXXLL motif of DNA-bound transcription factors, such as STAT6.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was the identification of essential motifs in the transactivation domain of STAT6 to get new insights into the transactivation mechanism of STAT6 and to identify targets to inhibit the STAT6 transactivation function. Transcriptional activation requires the recruitment of coactivators by DNA-bound transcription factors. This often occurs via protein/protein interaction mediated by distinct structural motifs within the transactivation domains of the DNA-bound transcription factors and the coactivator interaction domains (36Chen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In previous studies (14Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) we have shown that at least two coactivators, p300/CBP and NCoA-1, are involved in STAT6-mediated transactivation. Both coactivators bind independently to different parts of the STAT6 transactivation domain. NCoA-1 binds between residues 792 and 847 of the STAT6-TAD.In this study we have further characterized this interaction domain. Peptides spanning different parts of the STAT6 interaction domain and antibodies raised against these peptides were used to find potential interaction motifs. A peptide representing the first part of the STAT6 interaction domain (amino acids 794–814) efficiently competed for NCoA-1 binding. Moreover, antibodies recognizing this region in STAT6 efficiently blocked NCoA-1 binding, indicating that the NCoA-1 interaction motif lies between amino acids 794 and 814 of STAT6. Importantly, antibodies that bind very closely adjacent to the STAT6-binding motif were not able to block NCoA-1 binding, confirming that a particular motif has to be masked to prevent NCoA-1 binding. These experiments showed that it is possible to target the STAT6/NCoA-1 interaction very specifically either by masking the binding domain of NCoA-1 with peptides representing the STAT6-binding motif or by covering the STAT6-binding motif with an antibody. The inhibitory peptides and antibodies identified here will be valuable tools for further in vivo studies, e.g. microinjection experiments to investigate whether blocking the NCoA-1 recruitment will inhibit STAT6-mediated transactivation. In addition, the inhibitory peptide can present the starting point for the development of small molecules that block the STAT6/NCoA-1 interaction.The sequence of peptide 1 contains an LXXLL motif (where L is a leucine and X any amino acid). This motif was originally identified in transcriptional coactivators and mediates the interaction of these proteins with nuclear hormone receptors (31Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). LXXLL motifs are necessary and sufficient for the binding of these coactivators to ligand-bound nuclear hormone receptors, and they are required for coactivation of transcription. Here we demonstrate that the LXXLL motif in STAT6 is involved in the interaction of STAT6 with its coactivator NCoA-1. Point mutations (L802A,L805A) in the LXXLL motif (Fig. 2 A) completely abolished the interaction of GST-STAT6-TAD to NCoA-1 (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating the crucial role of the LXXLL motif for binding in vitro. Furthermore, we observed that the STAT6- LXXLL motif is absolutely required to recruit NCoA-1 to the promoter and to enhance transcription by the GAL4-DNA binding domain fusion of STAT6-TAD (amino acids 792–847). The transactivation potential of this GAL4 fusion seems to be based entirely on NCoA-1, which is present at different levels in 293T and NCI-H292 cells (data not shown). In 293T cells, which express high NCoA-1 levels, GAL4-STAT6-TAD strongly enhanced transcription (Fig. 3 B). In NCI-H292 cells, which express a much lower level, NCoA-1 seemed to be a limiting factor, leading to a weak transactivation potential (Fig.3 C). Cotransfection of NCoA-1 dramatically amplified transactivation by GAL4-STAT6-TAD. Recruitment of NCoA-1 to the GAL4-STAT6-TAD was strictly dependent on the intact LXXLL motif, because mutations of the motif completely abolished the transactivation potential of the GAL4-STAT6-TAD fusion in both cell lines, and this could not be rescued by coexpression of NCoA-1 (Fig. 3,B and C).We analyzed the function of the LXXLL motif in transcriptional activation by full-length STAT6. These experiments were performed in 293T cells, which lack functional STAT6 and can therefore be used for analyzing the function of STAT6 variants. In addition, the ability of 293T cells to produce eotaxin-3 after IL-4 treatment allowed us to analyze the contribution of the STAT6-LXXLL motif to the transactivation of an endogenous target gene (8Hoeck J. Woisetschlager M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3216-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The L802A,L805A mutation did not affect the activation by tyrosine phosphorylation or the DNA binding of STAT6 after IL-4 treatment (Fig.4 B). However, the ability to activate transcription on an artificial reporter gene containing multimerized STAT6-binding sites (Fig. 4) as well as on the endogenous eotaxin-3 target gene (Fig. 5) was strongly reduced. The STAT6- L802A,L805A variant displayed in both assays a 50% reduced transactivation potential compared with wild type STAT6. Significantly, the finding that eotaxin-3 protein expression was also reduced by 50% in STAT6 variant-expressing cells confirmed that the recruitment of NCoA-1 by the STAT6-LXXLL motif is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of chromatin-packaged endogenous genes. IL-4-induced transcriptional activation of the eotaxin-3 promoter is highly dependent on STAT6-binding sites (8Hoeck J. Woisetschlager M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3216-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast to other STAT6 target genes, e.g. the Cε germ line gene, no activation or synergistic effects on transcription by NF-κB was detected. Our results so far demonstrate that the expression of eotaxin-3 is largely dependent on the recruitment of NCoA-1 by the STAT6-LXXLL motif. However, we could not predict that this is true for all IL-4-regulated genes, especially when they are already activated by tumor necrosis factor-α. It is possible that the role of NCoA-1 in STAT6-mediated transactivation varies depending on the specific promoter context as well as on the cellular context. Further studies have to be performed to investigate the importance of the LXXLL motif for other STAT6 target genes.In previous studies we observed that the coactivator p300/CBP, which associates with NCoA-1 (19Kamei Y., Xu, L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R. Gloss B. Lin S.C. Heyman R.A. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

A. 1996; 93: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), binds directly to a different region of the STAT6-TAD (amino acids 677–791) (15Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45713-45721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore NCoA-1 could still be recruited to the STAT6-LXXLL mutant via bridging to p300/CBP. In this case NCoA-1 would have an even greater role in STAT6 transactivation. To evaluate the exact contribution of NCoA-1 for STAT6 transactivation, the transactivation potential of STAT6 has to be determined in cells lacking this coactivator.LXXLL motifs are abundant in different coactivators. Many coactivators contain several LXXLL motifs. The p160/SRC family members contain three motifs, which mediate the interaction with the nuclear hormone receptors and two motifs, which mediate the p300/CBP interaction. p300/CBP itself contains two motifs (31Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). All motifs described so far form α-helical structures with a hydrophobic face, which is built by the conserved leucines. However, not all LXXLL motifs are functionally equivalent. Sequences flanking the LXXLL motif determine target specificity (37Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ding X.F. Anderson C.M., Ma, H. Hong H. Uht R.M. Kushner P.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 302-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed whether the STAT6-LXXLL motif has any structural or functional relation to the NCoA-1-LXXLL motifs. From the structural prediction we assumed that the STAT6-LXXLL motif also forms an α-helix. However, this motif does not share any homologous residues amino- or carboxyl-terminally to the LXXLL core sequence with the motifs in the p160/SRC or p300/CBP coactivators (Fig. 6 and data not shown). Because positive as well as negative cross-talk between STAT proteins and nuclear receptors has been described (39Stocklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 40Biola A. Andreau K. David M. Sturm M. Haake M. Bertoglio J. Pallardy M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we tested whether the STAT6-LXXLL motif could compete with the NCoA-1-LXXLL motif for nuclear receptor binding. We demonstrated that peptide 1, which represents the STAT6-LXXLL motif and which was a potent inhibitor of the STAT6/NCoA-1 interaction, was not able to inhibit the NCoA-1/retinoic acid receptor α (Fig. 6) or NCoA-1/estrogen receptor interaction (data not shown). This suggests that the STAT6-LXXLL motif is unique and has most likely no function in cross-talk. It can also be expected that the structure of the STAT6-LXXLL is unique. Structural analyses of the STAT6-LXXLL peptide in complex with the STAT6 binding domain of NCoA-1, which we mapped to a region between amino acids 213 and 462 (15Litterst C.M. Pfitzner E. J. Biol.

The STAT6-LXXLL motif will be a new, attractive drug target. This motif is required for the STAT6-mediated expression of eotaxin-3, a potent chemoattractant of eosinophils. The recruitment of eosinophils to sites of inflammation is a hallmark of allergic diseases. Therefore inhibition of eotaxin-3 would be a beneficial therapy. It might be feasible to inhibit the STAT6 signaling pathway by targeting the STAT6-LXXLL motif without affecting similar motifs. Moreover, small drug inhibitors can be developed based on the peptide characterized here that will be able to inhibit the STAT6/NCoA-1 interaction. STAT61 belongs to the STAT family of transcription factors that transmit signals from activated cytokine receptors to the nucleus. Following their obligatory tyrosine phosphorylation exerted by JAK kinases, STATs dimerize and move to the nucleus where they modulate transcription through binding to specific DNA sequence elements (1Darnell J.E.

Res. 2001; 50: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). STAT6 becomes activated in response to IL-4 and IL-13 and mediates most of the gene expression regulated by these cytokines. IL-4 regulates immune and anti-inflammatory responses. It promotes the differentiation of T helper (Th) precursors toward the Th2 lineage while inhibiting Th1 development. Furthermore, IL-4 triggers immunoglobulin class switching to the IgE isotype in B-cells. STAT6-deficient mice have defects in IL-4-mediated Th2 development and immunoglobulin class switching to IgE, demonstrating the essential role of STAT6 in these functions (5Shimoda K. van Deursen J.

Eotaxin-3 is a member of the family of CC chemokines, which are known to be potent chemoattractants for eosinophils.

Ear swelling was induced by challenge with DNFB, accompanied by infiltration of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils and a marked increase in mRNA levels of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-1β, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor-α in the challenged ear skin. Both ear swelling and the number of infiltrated cells in DNFB-challenged ear skin were significantly inhibited by treatment with SB202190, a p38 inhibitor. Furthermore, the DNFB-induced expression of all cytokines except IL-4 was significantly inhibited by treatment with SB202190. Ribonuclease protection assay revealed that the mRNA levels of chemokines such as IP-10 and MCP-1 in ear skin were markedly increased at 24 h after challenge with DNFB. The induction of these chemokines was significantly inhibited by treatment with SB202190. In p38α +/− mice, both ear swelling and infiltration of cells induced by DNFB were reduced compared with those in wild-type mice. However, induction of cytokines by DNFB was also observed in p38α +/− mice, although the induction of IFN-γ, IL-5, and IL-18 was typically reduced compared with that in wild-type mice. Challenge with DNFB slightly induced IP-10 and MCP-1 mRNA in p38α +/− mice, with weaker signals than those in SB202190-treated wild-type mice.

Many groups have demonstrated that the p38 signaling pathway possibly controls inflammatory responses as follows. p38 has a role in transducing the mitogenic signal in T cells in response to interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-7 (12Crawley J.B.

These findings tempt us to think that targeting of p38 might be a suitable anti-cytokine strategy for inflammatory disease. Against this notion, it was reported that inhibition of p38 activity rather leads to induction of TNF-α and IL-6 in some cases (18Zhang C. Baumgartner R.A. Yamada K. Beaven M.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we used a murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS) model induced by 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB) to investigate the role of p38 in inflammatory disease. First, we elucidated the inhibitory effect of SB202190, a p38 inhibitor, on DNFB-induced CHS. Second, we investigated how DNFB induces CHS in p38α heterozygous mice. The use of animal in all our experiments was in accordance with guidelines of Chiba University for animal care. Female mice heterozygous for targeted disruption of the p38α gene (10Tamura K. Sudo T. Senftleben U. Dadak A.M. Johnson R. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 102: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) were crossed with C57BL/6J male mice (Saitama Experimental Animal Supply Co.) to generate p38α +/− and p38α +/+ (wild-type; Wt) mice. Offspring (>6 generations) were genotyped by PCR analysis of tail-derived DNA. Multiplex PCR with three primers per reaction was used. The primers were as follows: A, 5′-CCCTATACTCCCTCTCTGTGTAACTTTTG-3′; B, 5′-CCCAAACCCCAGAAAGAAATGATG-3′; and C, 5′-TTCAGTGACAACGTCGAGCACAGCTG-3′. Using these primers at 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, with an extension step of 7 min at 72 °C at the end of the last cycle, produced 800- and 450-bp fragments from the mutant and Wt alleles, respectively. Experiments were carried out by the protocol described previously (20Tomobe Y.I. Morizawa K. Tsuchida M. Hibino H. Nakano Y. Tanaka Y. Lipids. 2000; 35: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Female mice (Wt and p38 α +/−, 8 weeks old) were sensitized on the shaved back skin with 100 μl of 0.5% DNFB diluted with a 4:1 acetone and olive oil solution (A/O). Five days after induction, 20 μl of the same DNFB mixture as used for induction was applied to both ears of the sensitized mice (challenge). As the control, 20 μl of DNFB-free A/O solution was applied to both ears of the sensitized mice. Before the challenge and 12, 24, and 48 h afterward, the thickness of the ears was measured using a thickness gauge (Ozaki Manufacturing. Co.). For determination of the effect of SB202190, 25 μl of 10−5m SB202190 diluted with A/O solution was applied to both ears of the sensitized Wt mice 30 min prior to challenge. The mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 12, 24, or 48 h after challenge. Their ears were removed and immersed in 10% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and then embedded in paraffin and cut into sections 3 μm in thickness. The sections were placed on poly-l-lysine-coated slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Individual inflammatory cell types were counted in high power fields at ×1000 and expressed as cells per high power field, with means and S.E. calculated. The ears were taken from control and challenged Wt mice with or without SB202190 treatment at various times (12 and 24 h) after the challenge. In the case of p38α +/− mice, the ears were taken from control and challenged mice 24 h after the challenge. Total RNA was prepared from the ears as described previously (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Single strand cDNA from prepared RNA (2 μg) was synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 40 μl. The cDNA sample (1 μl) was subjected to PCR for amplification of each cytokine cDNA. In the preliminary experiments, we confirmed the linearity of the reactions to determine the optimal number of cycles for each PCR product. The primer sequences, annealing temperature, cycle number, and size of each product are defined in Table I. Using those primers, PCR was performed at 94 °C for 5 min followed by individual cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, individual temperature for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min with an extension step of 7 min at 72 °C at the end of the last cycle.Table IPrimer sequence, annealing temperature (A. temp.), number of cycles (Cycle no.), and size of PCR product used for detection of each cytokineGeneSequence (5′ to 3′)A. temp.Cycle no.Size°CbpIL-2SenseCAAGCTCTACAGCGGAAG5833370AntisenseTCCACCACAGTTGCTGACIFN-γSenseATCCTTTGGACCCTCTGACT6033529AntisenseCGACTCCTTTTCCGCTTCCTIL-4SenseACGGCACAGAGCTATTGATG6035454AntisenseATGGTGGCTCAGTACTACGAIL-5SenseATGTCCTGTAGTCAGTTAAACC6033733AntisenseAAGTTCAGTTACACGGAGAAGTIL1-βSenseTGGCAGCTACCTGTGTCTTT6035525AntisenseAGGCTTGTGCTCTGCTTGTGTNF-αSenseCCTCCCTCTCATCAGTTCTATG6035992AntisenseACACCCATTCCCTTCACAGAIL-18SenseACTGTACAACCGGAGTAATACGG6033319AntisenseTCCATCTTGTTGTGTCCTGGGAPDHSenseAATGTATCCGTTGTGGATCT6025262AntisenseTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA Open table in a new tab Multiprobe templates, mCK-5 containing DNA templates for the chemokines lymphotactin, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted, eotaxin, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α and β, MIP-2, IFN-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and TCA-3, and for the housekeeping genes L32 (ribosomal RNA) and GAPDH were purchased from Pharmingen. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the DNA templates were used to synthesize RNA probes, which were labeled with [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), in the presence of a GACU pool using a T7 polymerase. The probe was hybridized overnight with 10 μg of total RNA prepared from the ears of control and challenged mice under various conditions, followed by digestion with RNase A and T1. The samples were then treated with a proteinase K/SDS mixture, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated in the presence of ammonium acetate. The samples were loaded on an 5% acrylamide-urea sequencing gel next to undigested label probes and run at 30 watts with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer (TBE). The gel was dried on filter paper under a vacuum and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for visualizing the protected signals. The ears were taken from Wt, SB202190-treated Wt, and p38α +/− mice 24 h after the challenge. Epidermal cell (EC) suspensions were prepared by the protocol described previously with some modifications (22Yoshizeki H. Ghoreishi M. Takagawa S. Takayama K. Satoh T. Katayama I. Takeda K. Akira S. Nishioka K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In brief, the ears were washed with PBS and then treated with PBS containing 0.1% trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing the ears with PBS, epidermal sheets were peeled from the dermis using forceps. The sheets were treated with the medium (RPMI 1640 (Nissui Co., Japan) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin) containing 0.2% collagenase (Worthington) at 37 °C for 60 min. Then the sheets were vigorously stirred, and the resulting EC suspensions were pelleted. After washing with ice-cold PBS twice, the cells were reconstituted in 42% Percoll (AmershamBiosciences) and carefully layered over 72% Percoll. The centrifugation was performed at 500 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were collected from the interface and washed with ice-cold PBS twice. After suspending by gently passing through a 27-gauge needle, the cells were subjected to MACS separation with CD4 (L3T4) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The isolation of CD4+ cells was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The number of resulting cells was counted, and each CD4+ cell with the same number (5 × 105) from Wt, SB202190-treated Wt, and p38α +/− mice challenged with DNFB was subjected to RNA preparation and RT-PCR for detection of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA. Cell suspensions were obtained from lymph nodes from DNFB-sensitized Wt and p38α +/− littermate mice by the protocol described previously (22Yoshizeki H. Ghoreishi M. Takagawa S. Takayama K. Satoh T. Katayama I. Takeda K. Akira S. Nishioka K. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell suspensions (2 × 105 cells per 20 μl of PBS) were subcutaneously injected into the ears of naive Wt mice. The mice were immediately challenged by applying 20 μl of 0.5% DNFB in A/O solution or 20 μl of A/O solution alone on the ears. As a negative control, 20 μl of cell-free PBS was subcutaneously injected into the ears of naive Wt mice and immediately challenged with 0.5% DNFB. Ear thickness was measured as described above after 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1, DNFB induced ear swelling in mice in a time-dependent manner. The DNFB-induced ear swelling in SB202190-treated mice was significantly reduced compared with that in SB202190-untreated mice (p < 0.05). Histological analysis showed spongiosis in the challenged ear skin 24 h after challenge. Additionally, marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in the epidermis and dermis was observed in the challenged ear skin 24 and 48 h after challenge (Fig. 2, A–D). Treatment of mice with SB202190 decreased DNFB-induced pathophysiological parameters such as spongiosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the epidermis and dermis (Fig. 2, E–H). To characterize the inflammatory cells, sections of ear skin 24 h after challenge were examined under high power field. The infiltrated inflammatory cells were mainly mononuclear leukocytes, and significant migration of neutrophils and eosinophils was also observed (Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, treatment of mice with SB202190 markedly reduced the number of infiltrated mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils induced by DNFB in the challenged ear skin (p < 0.01).Figure 2Effect of SB202190 on time-dependent histopathological findings of CHS induced by DNFB. Histological features of CHS ear skin reaction were observed in control (A and E) mice and mice at 12 (B and F), 24 (C and G), and 48 h (D and H) after challenge.

As shown in Fig.4, mRNA of all of cytokines was rarely detected in the control ear skin from both SB202190-untreated and -treated mice. Induction of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-1β, and IL-18 mRNA in ear skin challenged with DNFB was observed 12 and 24 h after challenge. Induction of IL-4 and TNF-α mRNA in ear skin challenged with DNFB was also observed 24 h after challenge. In SB202190-treated mice, the induction of cytokine mRNA of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α in the challenged ear skin was markedly suppressed compared with that in SB202190-untreated mice. On the contrary, DNFB challenge-induced IL-4 mRNA induction was not affected by SB202190 treatment. To elucidate how DNFB-induced CHS progresses in p38α +/− mice, we investigated ear swelling, expression of cytokines, and infiltration of inflammatory cells in DNFB-challenged ear skin of p38α +/− mice. In p38α +/− mice, DNFB-induced ear swelling was significantly reduced 24 h after challenge with DNFB compared with Wt mice (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B, the mRNA levels of IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α were increased in the ear skin of p38α +/− mice 24 h after challenge with DNFB. The induction of IFN-γ, IL-5, and IL-18 mRNA by DNFB was suppressed in p38α +/− mice compared with Wt mice. On the other hand, the induction of IL-2, IL-4, IL-1β, and TNF-α mRNA by DNFB was similar in p38α +/− and Wt mice. The number of infiltrating mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils in the challenged ear skin was calculated in p38α +/− mice and Wt mice with or without SB202190 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the number of infiltrated mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils induced by DNFB in the challenged ear skin of p38α +/− mice was significantly reduced compared with that in Wt mice and was similar to that in SB202190-treated mice (p < 0.01). To elucidate whether the expression of chemokines was affected by DNFB, an RNase protection assay for a series of chemokines was performed with total RNA samples from Wt, SB202190-treated Wt, and p38α +/− mice. As shown in Fig. 6, low expression of MIP-1β and MIP-1α mRNA and high expression of MIP-2 mRNA were observed in control ear skin of Wt mice. Challenge with DNFB markedly increased the expression of IP-10 and MCP-1 mRNA. This typical expression of IP-10 and MCP-1 mRNA induced by DNFB was significantly inhibited by treatment with SB202190. The expression of MIP-1β, MIP-1α, and MIP-2 mRNA observed in control ear skin of Wt mice with or without SB202190 treatment was not detected in control ear skin of p38α +/− mice, although expression of internal controls, L32 and GAPDH mRNA, was clearly demonstrated. Challenge with DNFB induced IP-10, MCP-1, and MIP-2 mRNA in ear skin of p38α +/− mice with very weak signals. The profiles of cytokines mRNA in CD4+cells infiltrated into ear skin of Wt, SB202190-treated Wt, and p38α +/− mice were elucidated 24 h after DNFB challenge. As shown in Fig. 7 A, mRNA of cytokines such as Th1-like cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-2, and Th2-like cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, was clearly detected in the infiltrated CD4+cells from Wt mice. The expression of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 mRNA in infiltrated CD4+ cells from SB202190-treated mice was also observed and similar to that from Wt mice, although the expression of IFN-γ mRNA was significantly decreased by SB202190 treatment. In p38α +/− mice, the expression of IFN-γ and IL-5 mRNA in infiltrated CD4+ cells was typically suppressed compared with that in Wt mice. On the other hand, the expression of IL-2 and IL-4 mRNA was similar in p38α +/− and Wt mice (Fig.7 B). To elucidate whether the reduction of CHS response to DNFB in p38α +/− mice takes place at the sensitization or elicitation phase, adoptive transfer experiments were performed. Ear swelling was measured 24 h after the challenge. As shown in Fig.8, DNFB induced ear swelling in Wt mice after the injection of lymph node cells (LNC) from the sensitized Wt mice. Also in case of injecting LNC from the sensitized p38α +/− mice into the ears of Wt mice, DNFB induced ear swelling. Even though LNC from the sensitized Wt or p38α +/− mice were injected into ears of Wt mice, application of DNFB-free A/O solution alone on the ears did not induce ear swelling. Without the injection of LNC, DNFB induced no ear swelling in naive Wt mice. The present study was designed to elucidate whether p38 is predominantly involved in the progression of CHS as a model of inflammatory disease and whether topical application of a p38 inhibitor has therapeutic utility in CHS. Here we showed that topical treatment with SB202190 significantly reduced both ear swelling and the histopathological findings induced by DNFB, indicating that p38 plays a critical role in CHS (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). The CHS model employed in the present study is based on chronic delayed type hypersensitivity (type IV hypersensitivity), because ear swelling and infiltration became worse and showed a maximum response 24 h after challenge. In the same CHS model, it has been demonstrated previously (23Yamazaki S. Kuwahara H. Kakishima H. Yakugaku Zasshi. 1997; 117: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that expression of a Th1-like cytokine, IFN-γ, in the skin lesion is essential for the formation of CHS by analysis using an anti-IFN-γ antibody that neutralizes the bioactivity of IFN-γ. The Th1-like cytokine, IFN-γ, plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity and chronic inflammation (24O'Garra A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of SB202190 on IFN-γ expression in the skin lesion is primarily important for understanding the mechanism of SB202190-suppressed CHS. As expected, DNFB-induced IFN-γ expression was significantly inhibited by treatment of sensitized mice with SB202190 (Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of SB202190 on IFN-γ mRNA expression in the present study is consistent with the previous in vitro finding that expression of IFN-γ by Th1 effector cells is mediated by p38 (14Rincón M. Enslen H. Raingeaud J. Recht M. Zapton T., Su, M.S.-S. Penix L.A. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2817-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). IL-12, which was identified as an inducer of Th1-specific immune response, is known to promote IFN-γ production, and the p40 subunit is especially induced in CHS (25Schwarz T. Res. Immunol. 1995; 146: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Robinson D. Shibuya K. Mui A. Zonin F. Murphy E. Sana T. Hartley S.B. Menon S. Kastelein R. Bazan F. O'Garra A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Likewise, neutralization of IL-12 prevents DNFB-induced CHS (27Riemann H. Schwarz A. Grabbe S. Aragane Y. Luger T.A. Wysocka M. Kubin M. Trinchieri G. Schwarz T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1799-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the p38 signaling pathway is crucial for IL-12 production (15Lu H.-T Yang D.D. Wysk M. Gatti E. Mellman I. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, IL-12 p40 mRNA was not detectable in control or challenged ear skin by RT-PCR with 40 cycles of amplification, although the primers used could detect IL-12 p40 mRNA in other tissues (data not shown). This might be explained by the previous investigation that IL-12 within the epidermis was detectable in human skin but not murine skin (27Riemann H. Schwarz A. Grabbe S. Aragane Y. Luger T.A. Wysocka M. Kubin M. Trinchieri G. Schwarz T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1799-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Then, we investigated the expression of IL-18, another strong cofactor for Th1 cell development, in DNFB-challenged ear skin, because functional expression of IL-18 by murine keratinocytes has been reported (28Stoll S. Muller G. Kurimoto M. Saloga J. Tanimoto T. Yamauchi H. Okamura H. Knop J. Enk A.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 298-302PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of IL-18 mRNA was increased in DNFB-challenged ear skin and was significantly inhibited by SB202190 (Fig. 4). As IL-18 was initially identified as an IFN-γ inducing factor and stimulated IFN-γ production in a p38 signal-dependent manner (29Okamura H. Tsutsi H. Komatsu T. Yutsudo M. Hakura A. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Okura T. Nukada Y. Hattori K. Akita K. Namba M. Tanabe F. Konishi K. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Nature. 1995; 378: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar,30Yang J. Zhu H. Murphy T.L. Ouyang W. Murphy K.M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the suppression of IL-18 production by SB202190 in the ear skin lesion may synergistically cause a decrease in expression of IFN-γ mRNA. On the other hand, Th1-like cytokine IL-2 also plays an important role in cell-mediated immunity and chronic inflammation through T cell growth and activation (24O'Garra A. Immunity. 1998; 8: 275-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of IL-2 mRNA in the DNFB-challenged ear skin was significantly inhibited by SB202190 (Fig. 4). This result is supported by the previous in vitro studies showing that p38 regulates the IL-2 gene (31Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition to Th1-like cytokines, recent studies demon"

Two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV, play dominant roles in polysialic acid synthesis on NCAM. However, the individual roles and mechanisms by which these two enzymes form large amounts of polysialic acid on NCAM were heretofore unknown. Previous studies indicate that ST8Sia IV forms more highly polysialylatedN-glycans on NCAM than ST8Sia II in vitro. In the present study, we first demonstrated that a combination of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV cooperatively polysialylated NCAM, resulting in NCAMN-glycans containing more, and thus longer, polysialic acid than when the enzymes were used individually. There was also an increase in polysialylated NCAM when we used ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV sequentially, whereas there appeared to be a subtle increase when the enzymes were used in the reverse order. Furthermore, ST8Sia IV was able to add polysialic acid to oligosialylated oligosaccharides and unpolysialylated antennas in N-glycans attached to NCAM, even when polysialic acid was attached to at least one of the other antennas. By contrast, ST8Sia II added little polysialic acid to the same acceptors. On the other hand, neither ST8Sia II nor ST8Sia IV could add polysialic acid to a polysialylated antenna of NCAMN-glycans. These combined results indicate that the synergistic effect of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV is caused by: 1) the ability of ST8Sia IV to add polysialic acid to oligosialic acid formed by ST8Sia II, 2) the potential of ST8Sia IV to act on more antennas ofN-glycans than ST8Sia II, and 3) the ability of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV in combination to act on the fifth and sixthN-glycosylation sites of NCAM.

In embryonic tissues, NCAM is highly polysialylated, whereas the majority of NCAM in adult tissues lacks polysialic acid, except for polysialylated NCAM, which is continuously present in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of adult brain where neuronal generation persists (5Edelman G.M.

NCAM knockout mice exhibit a defect in spatial learning and memory due to a defect in the hippocampus and an anomaly in the olfactory bulb, both of which are likely caused by the absence of polysialylated NCAM (13Tomasiewicz H.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3072-3080PubMed Google Scholar). In both small and non-small cell lung carcinomas, the expression of polysialic acid is associated with tumor progression, and in particular, in tumor dissemination (17Scheidegger E.P. Lackie P.M.

These observations as a whole suggest that polysialic acid facilitates migration of tumor cells and allows pathogens to avoid attack by the immune system in vivo. Both to determine the roles of polysialic acid in neural development and develop therapeutic agents for the treatment of relevant diseases, it is critical to understand how polysialic acid is synthesized. To date, two polysialyltransferases, ST8Sia IV (also called PST) and ST8Sia II (also called STX), that add polysialic acid to NCAM have been molecularly cloned (20Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Eckhardt M. Muhlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

These enzymes catalyze transfer of multiple α2,8-linked sialic acid residues to an acceptor containing a structure of NeuNAcα2→3(or 6)Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→R (25Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the presence of polysialic acid is always associated with the expression of ST8Sia II and/or ST8Sia IV (28Kurosawa N. Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 494-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Phillips G.R. Krushel L.A. Crossin K.L. Dev.

Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has not been known, however, how ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV distinctly contribute to polysialic acid synthesis. Recent studies demonstrate that inactivation of ST8Sia IV in mice through homologous recombination results in impaired long term potentiation and long term depression in Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses of the adult hippocampus (31Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This defect is associated with the substantial decrease in polysialic acid in the CA1 region, although decreases of polysialylated NCAM are detected throughout the brain. Polysialic acid is not completely lost in the above mutant mice, presumably because ST8Sia II compensates for loss of ST8Sia IV. However, the amount and size of polysialylated NCAM is significantly decreased in ST8Sia IV mutant mice, suggesting distinct roles for each polysialyltransferase in polysialylation of NCAM. These results combined indicate that ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV cooperatively control expression of polysialic acidin vivo. Previously it has been demonstrated that both ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV add polysialic acid to N-glycans attached to NCAM more efficiently than N-glycans released from NCAM (27Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Kojima N. Tachida Y. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19457-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both polysialyltransferases can utilize synthetic sialylated N-acetyllactosamine oligosaccharides that mimic a portion of N-glycans as acceptors (27Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Significantly, ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV cooperatively act on NCAM and the amount of polysialic acid synthesized by both enzymes is greater than that synthesized by either enzyme alone (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). ST8Sia IV prefers theN-glycan on the sixth glycosylation site over theN-glycan on the fifth site of NCAM, whereas ST8Sia II does not clearly show this preference. This differential preference for polysialylation sites apparently leads to synergistic polysialylation by both enzymes, because efficient polysialylation at the fifth and sixth N-glycosylation sites can be achieved only when both polysialyltransferases are present (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This synergistic effect could be also observed if ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV added polysialic acid to different antennas of NCAM N-glycans. Structural analysis has demonstrated that polysialylated N-glycans of NCAM contain tri- or tetra-antennas (33Kudo M. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Shiokawa K. Morris H.R. Dell A. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 32667-32677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 34Von der Ohe M. Wheeler S.F. Wuhrer M. Harvey D.J. Liedtke S. Mühlenhoff M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Geyer H. Dwek R.A. Geyer R. Wing D.R. Schachner M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the same studies have not resolved the issue of how polysialylation takes place on more than one antenna in the same N-glycan. To understand how both polysialyltransferases synergistically act on NCAM, in the present study we first show that the presence of both ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV results in an increased amount of longer polysialylated N-glycans on NCAM than that seen with either enzyme alone. We then demonstrate that this effect can also be observed when only one N-glycosylation site of NCAM is available for polysialylation. The use of both synthetic oligosialic acid and NCAM as acceptors then allowed us to conclude that ST8Sia IV in particular can add polysialic acid on an oligosialic acid precursor, whereas NCAM extensively polysialylated by ST8Sia IV is a poor acceptor for either enzyme. Finally, we show that additional polysialylation by ST8Sia IV occurs on an antenna that is not fully elongated by polysialic acid even when other antennas contain polysialic acid. These results suggest that ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV exhibit a synergistic effect due to the fact that ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV differentially utilizeN-glycans on different sites of NCAM, that ST8Sia IV adds polysialic acid to oligosialic acid formed by ST8Sia II action, and that possibly ST8Sia IV can add polysialic acid on more antennas than can ST8Sia II. Cloning of pcDNAI harboring ST8Sia IV cDNA, pcDNAI-ST8Sia IV, and a soluble form of ST8Sia IV fused to a signal peptide and the IgG binding domain of protein A, pcDNAI-A·ST8Sia IV, was described previously (22Nakayama J.

Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In these mutant forms of NCAM, Asn-423 (fourth site), Asn-449 (fifth site), and Asn-478 (sixth site) were mutated to Gln residues. cDNAs encoding NCAM·IgG mutants harboring various Ig-like domains were constructed as follows. The parent plasmid pIG-NCAM·IgG harbors a soluble form NCAM·IgG cDNA at the HindIII andXbaI sites of pCDM8. There is an internal EcoRI site in the NCAM sequence between Ig-like domain 5 and the fibronectin type III-like domain. First, the amino-terminal region of NCAM, NCAM(0), was amplified by PCR using the T7 primer and the NC-0-E primer, 5′-CGGAATTCCCCCTGGCTGGGAACA-3′ (EcoRI site is underlined), and pIG-NCAM·IgG as template. After subcloning into pBluescript II vector (Stratagene) and sequencing, a fragment was obtained following digestion with HindIII andEcoRI. The HindIII-EcoRI fragment encoding the amino terminus to the end of the fifth Ig domain of pIG-NCAM·IgG was replaced with the above fragment. The resultant plasmid DNA encodes the signal peptide region and two fibronectin type III-like domains fused with the hinge and constant regions of human IgG and is designated pIG-NCAM(0)·IgG. cDNAs encoding the third to fifth (3Nelson R.W.

After sequencing, the PCR products were digested by EcoRI and inserted into theEcoR1 site of pIG-NCAM(0)·IgG, resulting in pIG-NCAM(3, 4, 5)·IgG, pIG-NCAM(4, 5)·IgG, and pIG-NCAM(5)·IgG, respectively. Oligosialic acids were prepared by a partial hydrolysis of colominic acid (average degree of polymerization = 30, Sigma) at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 0.2m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.8, at 37 °C for 48 h as described previously (4Angata K.

The acid hydrolysis was terminated by addition of 3 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the products were separated by Mono-Q HPLC (see below). NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl was enzymatically synthesized from synthetic oligosaccharide Galβ1→ 4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl as described previously (27Angata K. Suzuki M.

NCAM·IgG, NCAM(N5)·IgG, NCAM(N6)·IgG, NCAM(3, 4, 5)·IgG, NCAM(4, 5)·IgG, and NCAM(5)·IgG were isolated from the culture medium of COS-1 cells that had been transiently transfected with pIG vectors harboring respective cDNAs. NCAM·IgG chimeric protein was also released from HeLa cells that had been cultured in the absence or presence of swainsonine (10 μg/ml, Calbiochem). Those NCAM·IgG chimeric proteins were purified by adsorbing to protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The amount of NCAM·IgG was estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. HeLa cells stably expressing a soluble chimeric form of ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV were established as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in a serum-free medium, Macrophage-SFM (Invitrogen). Soluble chimeric forms of these enzymes were purified by adsorbing to IgG-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences). A 50% suspension of the enzyme-adsorbed IgG-Sepharose in the same serum-free medium was used as an enzyme source to measure enzymatic activity as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M.

Briefly, the substrate solution (50 μl) consisted of 10 pmol of NCAM·IgG containing 60 pmol of N-glycans, 1 nmol of synthetic oligosaccharide, or 1 nmol of oligosialic acid as an acceptor, and 2.4 nmol (0.7 μCi) of donor CMP-[14C]NeuNAc or CMP-[3H]NeuNAc in the same reaction mixture as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To this substrate solution, 50 μl of the enzyme solution, prepared as described above, was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. For characterization of products from NCAM acceptors, the reaction mixture was briefly centrifuged to remove the enzymes adsorbed to beads, and the supernatant containing NCAM·IgG was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by fluorography as described previously (25Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To add polysialyltransferases sequentially, the above supernatant after the first reaction was filtered repeatedly in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 using Microcon 30 (Millipore) to remove free CMP-[3H]NeuNAc. After final washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, purified radiolabeled NCAM·IgG was used as an acceptor for the second reaction. In parallel, N-glycans from radiolabeled and purified NCAM·IgG were isolated after N-glycanase treatment followed by phenol-water partition to remove proteins (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

The water phase was washed with chloroform and then releasedN-glycans were analyzed by Mono-Q HPLC as described below. Products obtained from oligosialic acids or sialylated synthetic oligosaccharide were directly analyzed by Mono-Q HPLC. Mono-Q anion exchange HPLC was carried out under the same conditions as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Mono-QHR 5/5 (0.5 × 5 cm, AmershamBiosciences) was equilibrated with solvent A (2 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5), and the applied sample was eluted with a four-step linear gradient elution using solvent B (1 m NaCl and 10% acetonitrile in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Gilson 306 HPLC apparatus. After the sample was injected, the sample was eluted with solvent A for 10 min then eluted with a linear gradient from 0% to 33% of solvent B over the course of 80 min followed by a linear gradient to 45% of solvent B over the next 50 min, then by a linear gradient to 70% in the following 80 min. Finally, the sample was linearly eluted to 100% of solvent B in the last 10 min. After elution with 100% of solvent B for an additional 10 min, the column was equilibrated again with solvent A. The sample was co-injected with partial hydrolysates of colominic acid to determine the degree of polymerization (DP). Sialic acid oligomers and polymers were detected by adsorption atA 214 nm, whereas the products were detected by determining the radioactivity of the effluent by scintillation counting as described previously (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The above elution conditions (condition II) were used to ensure that highly polysialylated glycans could be fractionated. In previously described elution conditions (27Angata K. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18594-18601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the column was washed by 100% of solvent B once the gradient reached 45% of solvent B at 140 min (condition I). When NCAM·IgG was incubated with the soluble form of ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV and CMP-[14C]NeuNAc, ST8Sia IV formed larger polysialylated NCAM·IgG than did ST8Sia II (Fig.1 A). ST8Sia II produced two heterogeneous polysialylated forms of NCAM (Fig. 1 A). The higher molecular weight band is probably a dimer of polysialylated NCAM·IgG, which was also observed in the previous study (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine the total number of sialic acid residues attached to NCAMN-glycans, the same samples were digested withN-glycanase and released N-glycans were fractionated. The results shown in Fig. 1 B illustrate that ST8Sia IV added up to a total of 55 sialic acid residues to an NCAMN-glycan. On the other hand, ST8Sia II produced fewer NCAMN-glycans containing more than 30 sialic acids than did ST8Sia IV. Similarly, it has been reported that ST8Sia IV formed NCAMN-glycans with more than 70 sialic acids, whereas ST8Sia II formed those with ∼40 sialic acids (41Kitazume-Kawaguchi S. Kabata S. Arita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15696-15703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The results also demonstrate that both ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV formed a large amount of di-sialylated and oligosialylated NCAM N-glycans (see cpm/DP curve in Fig. 1 B). This result is striking because the products were obtained after a long incubation period. In all of the following experiments, the activity of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV samples were checked using NCAM·IgG as an acceptor before the experiments were undertaken, and the amount of the enzyme samples was adjusted to exhibit similar levels of activity toward NCAM·IgG as seen in Fig. 1 A. As shown in the left panelof Fig. 2, the combined activity of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV produced NCAM with more polysialic acid than did the action by ST8Sia II or ST8Sia IV alone, consistent with previous results (4Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28524-28532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The amount of polysialic acid formed by a mixture of ST8Sia II and ST8Sia IV was more than 157.1%, which would be expected from a simple addition of two separate reactions (Fig. 2,left panel). To determine if this additive effect is due either to an increase in the amount of polysialic acid containingN-glycans of all different sizes or to an increase in longer polysialic acid, the resultant N-glycans released from NCAM·IgG were fractionated. As seen in Fig. 2 c, more polysialylated N-glycans of NCAM shifted to"

Although both hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) can activate downstream signaling pathways in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells, EGF fails to promote the breakdown of cell-cell junctional complexes and initiate an invasive morphogenic program. We have undertaken a strategy to identify signals that synergize with EGF in this process. We provide evidence that the overexpression of the CrkII adapter protein complements EGF-stimulated pathways to induce cell dispersal in two-dimensional cultures and cell invasion and branching morphogenesis in three-dimensional collagen gels. This finding correlates with the ability of CrkII to promote the breakdown of adherens junctions in stable cell lines and the ability of EGF to stimulate enhanced Rac activity in cells overexpressing CrkII. We have previously shown that the Gab1-docking protein is required for branching morphogenesis downstream of the Met receptor. Consistent with a role for CrkII in promoting EGF-dependent branching morphogenesis, the binding of Gab1 to CrkII is required for the branching morphogenic program downstream of Met. Together, our data support a role for the CrkII adapter protein in epithelial invasion and morphogenesis and underscores the importance of considering the synergistic actions of signaling pathways in cancer progression.

Cell. 1992; 69: 385-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several growth factors stimulate the morphogenic program of epithelial cells. One of the most potent inducers of a morphogenic program in epithelial cells is hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 (2Montesano R. Matsumodo K. Nakamura T. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 67: 901-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). HGF is a mesenchymal derived growth factor that promotes several distinct biological responses through activation of the Met receptor tyrosine kinase (3Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Faletto D.L. Chan A.-L. Kmiecik T.E. Vande Woude G.F. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 802-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). HGF was originally identified as a potent mitogen for primary rat hepatocytes (4Nakamura T. Nishizawa T. Hagiya M. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Sugimura A. Tashiro K. Shimizu S. Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar), and HGF serum levels increase following damage to the liver, kidney, stomach, or lung (5Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). HGF was independently isolated as “scatter factor” as it stimulates epithelial cell dissociation and migration (6Stoker M. Gherardi E. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). HGF is also a potent morphogen for Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (7Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 66: 697-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) and promotes the inherent morphogenic program of kidney, breast, and lung epithelium grown in matrix cultures (2Montesano R.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important regulator of embryonic development and cell growth. In addition, EGF receptor knock-out mice exhibit impaired ductal growth and branching morphogenesis (13Wiesen J.F. Young P. Werb Z. Cunha G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 335-344PubMed Google Scholar), implicating EGF or other EGF receptor ligands in the morphogenic process.

However, the EGF-dependent signals required for these processes are poorly understood. Whereas HGF promotes a branching morphogenic program in MDCK and primary renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, EGF and other growth factors fail to do so (2Montesano R. Matsumodo K. Nakamura T. Orci L. Cell. 1991; 67: 901-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 7Montesano R. Schaller G. Orci L.

Physiol. 1999; 180: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, treatment of primary renal proximal tubular epithelial cells with a combination of growth factors promotes a similar morphogenic response as HGF (21Bowes III, R.C. Lightfoot R.T. Van De Water B. Stevens J.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that the co-coordinated activation of multiple signaling pathways must be achieved to undergo an invasive morphogenic program. Hence, MDCK cells provide an experimental system to examine the signals that cooperate with EGF to promote epithelial cell dispersal and morphogenesis. Using chimeric Met receptors, we have undertaken structure function studies to define Met-dependent signals required for the morphogenic program. These demonstrated that a single tyrosine residue (Tyr-1356) and, in particular, the recruitment of the Grb2 adapter protein to this tyrosine is critical for the morphogenic process (22Zhu H.

This identifies Gab1 as a critical modulator of the morphogenic response downstream from the Met receptor and allows a structure function approach to define the Gab1-dependent signals required. Gab1 is a member of a family of docking proteins: Gab1, Gab2, and Gab3, which contain a conserved pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and multiple tyrosine residues that provide binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing proteins (30Holgado-Madruga M.

CrkII and CrkL are composed of a single SH2 and two SH3 domains (SH2-SH3-SH3) (43Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshav S. Hanafusa H.

The Crk SH2 domain binds a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including p130Cas, paxillin, Cbl, and Gab1, whereas the amino-terminal SH3 domain binds C3G, DOCK180, and Abl (45Feller S.M.

However, the role of Crk adapter proteins in epithelial morphogenesis has not been addressed. We demonstrate that the coupling of Crk with Gab1 is required for the invasive morphogenic program downstream from the Met receptor. Moreover, the overexpression of CrkII in MDCK cells synergizes with EGF-stimulated signaling pathways to promote the dispersal of colonies of MDCK epithelial cells, invasion, and branching morphogenesis, whereas each alone is insufficient. Dr. George Vande Woude (Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI) provided HGF, and CSF-1 was provided by the Genetics Institute (Boston, MA). EGF was purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec, Canada). CrkII and Rac antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). HA.11 antibodies were obtained from Berkley Antibody Company (Berkley, CA). Antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated form of ERK1/2 were purchased from New England BioLabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Dr. John Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) provided an ERK1/2 antibody (C2) that recognizes total ERK1/2. Met (144) antibodies were described previously (51Rodrigues G.A.

MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamicin (Invitrogen). The generation of stable cell lines overexpressing CrkII was described previously (52Lamorte L. Royal I. Naujokas M. Park M. Mol. Biol.

For the generation of stable cell lines expressing Gab1ΔCrk, MDCK cells expressing CSF-Met N1358H (CSF-MetΔGrb2) (23Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with pcDNA1.1-Gab1ΔCrk and pLXSH, which confers resistance to Hygromycin B, using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Cell lines were selected in Hygromycin B (300 ng/ml, Roche Diagnostics) for 10–14 days, and stable clones were isolated and screened by Western blotting. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (52Lamorte L. Royal I. Naujokas M. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The ability of MDCK cells to form branching tubules was assayed as described previously (22Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 5 × 103 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of a collagen solution composed of 95–98% Type I collagen with the remainder composed of Type III collagen (Cohesion Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and layered over 350 μl of the same collagen solution in a 24-well plate. The cells were maintained in Liebowitz medium containing 5% FBS and allowed to form cysts for 5–7 days. For stimulations, HGF (15 units/ml), CSF-1 (5 units/ml), or EGF (20 or 100 ng/ml) was added to Liebowitz medium containing 3% FBS. Fresh growth factor and medium were added every 5–6 days. The tubules were photographed 10–14 days later using a Retiga 1300 digital camera (QIMAGING, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) and a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope with a ×10 or 32 objective (Carl Zeiss Canada Ltd., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Image analysis was carried out using Northern Eclipse version 6.0 (Empix Imaging, Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). Each assay was quantitated by counting the number of cysts and branched tubules in 4–6 independent fields for each cell line using a dissecting microscope. The results from 4–5 independent experiments were pooled and are represented graphically. The invasion assays were carried out in the same fashion as described above with the exception that 104 cells were seeded and allowed to form small colonies for 2 days prior to stimulation with growth factor. Cells were photographed 2 days later using a ×32 objective. MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII were plated at 6 × 105/100-mm dish and were serum-starved the next day for 20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.02% FBS. Cells were stimulated with 70 units/ml HGF or 70 ng/ml EGF for 5 and 180 min, respectively. Cells were lysed in 1.0% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. 30 μg of cell lysate was used for Western blotting with antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with ERK1/2 antibodies. MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII were grown for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and serum-starved for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.02% FBS. Cells were then stimulated with 70 units/ml HGF or 70 ng/ml EGF for the indicated times and lysed in Rac lysis buffer (53Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). 700 μg of cell lysate was used for pull down assays with the CRIB domain of PAK1 fused to glutathione S-transferase as described previously (53Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). HGF induces the dispersal and morphogenesis of MDCK cells. Other growth factors, such as EGF, fail to induce this response (29Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 54Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), even though MDCK cells express the EGF receptor and downstream signaling pathways including Gab1 are activated following EGF stimulation (29Maroun C.R.

Thus, MDCK cells provide an experimental system to examine the signals that cooperate with EGF to promote cell dispersal and morphogenesis. Cell dispersal in response to HGF (Fig. 1 A, d–f) occurs in a stepwise process, whereby cells in the colony spread initially lose their cell-cell adherens junctions and then adopt a fibroblastic cell morphology and disperse (53Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 55Royal I. Park M. J. Biol.

To examine why EGF fails to induce the dispersal of colonies of MDCK cells, we examined the response of MDCK cells to EGF. Although colonies of MDCK cells show some morphological changes in response to EGF (20 and 100 ng/ml), they failed to disperse (Fig. 1 A, g–l). Moreover, in response to EGF, cells retain adherens junctions and tight junctions as indicated by the presence of β-catenin and ZO-1 at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1 A, g–l). In contrast, in response to HGF, adherens-based cell-cell junctions are decreased in spread cells and lost in dispersed cells as demonstrated by the loss of β-catenin and ZO-1 at the cell membrane (Fig.1 A, d–f) (55Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 57Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Cell spreading and loss of adherens junctions in response to HGF requires activation of PI3K, MEK1, and the small GTPase Rac (53Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,55Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 56Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In a search for other HGF-dependent signals that play a role in this process, we have established that overexpression of the CrkII adapter protein in MDCK cells promotes cell spreading and loss of adherens junctions in the absence of HGF (52Lamorte L. Royal I. Naujokas M. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CrkII overexpression mimics the early stages following HGF stimulation, and the cells remain as colonies (Fig. 1 B, f). Consistent with this finding, MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII dispersed in response to suboptimal levels of HGF (Fig. 1 B,b and g, 0.5 units/ml), demonstrating that CrkII can synergize with HGF for epithelial cell dispersal. These results prompted us to examine whether CrkII would synergize with a growth factor such as EGF that fails to promote the dispersal and invasion of MDCK cells. Unlike parental MDCK cells (Fig. 1 B,d and e), MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII dispersed in response to EGF (Fig. 1 B, i andj, 20 or 100 ng/ml). Hence, CrkII overexpression synergizes with EGF to promote the dispersal of colonies of MDCK cells, suggesting that CrkII may synergize with EGF to promote an invasive and morphogenic response. Cell invasiveness in response to EGF or HGF was examined by stimulating MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII seeded in three-dimensional collagen gels (Fig.2). In the absence of growth factor stimulation, both MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII formed small spherical colonies (Fig. 2, a and e). HGF stimulation of MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII promoted the dispersal and invasion of cells (Fig. 2, b andf). In contrast, EGF stimulation of MDCK cells promoted the formation of small cellular extensions, but the cells failed to detach and invade the collagen gel (Fig. 2, c and d). In contrast, in the presence of EGF, MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII dispersed and invaded the collagen gel where 80–90% of the colonies underwent invasion in response to EGF (Fig. 2, g andh). 80–100 colonies were scored for each condition. The invasive response to EGF in CrkII-overexpressing cells (Fig. 2,g and h) was similar to cells stimulated with HGF (Fig. 2, b and f). Similar responses were observed in several independent clones of MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII (data not shown). Hence, although the overexpression of CrkII or the activation of EGF-dependent signaling pathways is not sufficient for the dispersal of epithelial colonies or the invasion of MDCK cells plated in three-dimensional collagen gels, together they cooperate to promote both cell dispersal and invasion. The ability of EGF to promote cell dispersal and invasion in MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII but not parental MDCK cells suggested that CrkII-dependent signals synergize with EGF. In response to HGF, the loss of adherens junctions is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1 and PI3K (55Royal I. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27780-27787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 57Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To investigate the EGF-dependent signals required for the dispersal of CrkII-overexpressing cells, cells were pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1 (U0126) and PI3K (LY294002). Whereas LY294002 inhibited HGF-stimulated dispersal of MDCK cells and loss of the tight junction marker, ZO-1 (Fig.3 A, c andd), LY294002 pretreatment failed to inhibit EGF- or HGF-induced dispersal of CrkII-overexpressing cells (Fig.3 B, e, f, k, andl). In contrast, the pretreatment of CrkII-overexpressing cells with UO126 blocked both the HGF- and EGF-dependent loss of ZO-1 from cell-cell junctions and cell scatter (Fig.3 B, g, h, m, andn), indicating that MEK1-dependent pathways are absolutely required. Sustained ERK1/2 activation in response to HGF correlates with a Met-dependent morphogenic response (39Maroun C.R. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8513-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the pharmacological inhibition of MEK1 blocked both cell dispersal (57Potempa S. Ridley A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2185-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and the morphogenic program (54Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B.M. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in response to HGF. Hence, the inability of EGF to stimulate cell dispersal and branching morphogenesis in MDCK cells may reflect the ability of HGF but not EGF to promote sustained ERK1/2 activation. To examine this possibility, we established whether the overexpression of CrkII altered the temporal activation of ERK1/2 in response to EGF. Lysates were prepared from MDCK and MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII stimulated with HGF or EGF for 5 and 180 min and immunoblotted with a phosphorylation-specific ERK1/2 antibody raised against the active site. EGF- and HGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased and similar in MDCK cells stimulated for 5 min (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). Although HGF stimulation promoted sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation, up to 180 min, ERK1/2 phosphorylation returned to basal levels in both CrkII-overexpressing and in MDCK cells stimulated with EGF (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). All samples contained similar levels of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). Although the overexpression of CrkII did not promote sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to EGF, the ability of EGF to promote dispersal in MDCK cells overexpressing CrkII is MEK1-dependent.

This rise in [Ca2+]i was inhibited strongly by apyrase, grade VII (which has a low ATP/ADPase ratio) but not by apyrase grade VI (which has a high ATP/ADPase ratio) or hexokinase, indicating that extracellular ADP and/or ATP play a role in the [Ca2+]i increase. The hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i was prevented by the prior discharge of the intracellular Ca2+ store of the cells by thapsigargin. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ or inhibition of Ca2+ influx by 1–10 μm Gd3+depleted the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and thereby diminished the rise in [Ca2+]i. The hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i was prevented by adenosine 2′-phosphate-5′-phosphate (A2P5P) and pyridoxyl-5′-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonate, inhibitors of purinergic P2Y1 receptors for which ADP is a major agonist. Both inhibitors also blocked the rise in [Ca2+]ielicited by addition of ADP to cells in isotonic medium, whereas A2P5P had no effect on the rise in [Ca2+]i elicited by the addition of the P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptor agonist, UTP. HTC cells were shown to express mRNA encoding for rat P2Y1, P2Y2, and P2Y6 receptors. Inhibition of the hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i blocked hypotonically induced K+ (86Rb+) efflux, modulated the hypotonically induced efflux of taurine, but had no significant effect on Cl− (125I−) efflux. The interaction of extracellular ATP and/or ADP with P2Y1purinergic receptors therefore plays a role in the response of HTC cells to osmotic swelling but does not account for activation of all the efflux pathways involved in the volume-regulatory response.

Cells swollen by a decrease in the osmolality of the external medium return to their original volume by a process known as regulatory volume decrease (RVD). 1The abbreviations used are: RVD, regulatory volume decrease; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; A2P5P, adenosine 2′-phosphate-5′-phosphate; A3P5P, adenosine 3′-phosphate-5′-phosphate; Δ[Ca2+]i, maximum increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; FBS, fetal bovine serum; HBS, HEPES-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; 2-MeSADP, 2-methylthioadenosine-5′-diphosphate; PPADS, pyridoxyl-5′-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonate; RT, reverse transcriptase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum. The signaling pathways activated during RVD have not yet been elucidated fully but result in the efflux of the inorganic ions, K+and Cl−, and organic molecules, with a concomitant efflux of water and a decrease in cell volume. Transient increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) have been observed in response to osmotic swelling in many, but not all, cell types (1Foskett J.K. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 259-277Google Scholar, 2Lang F. Busch G.L. Volkl H. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 1-45Google Scholar, 3Pasantes-Morales H. Morales Mulia S. Nephron. 2000; 86: 414-427Google Scholar) and may contribute to RVD by direct activation or modulation of K+, Cl−, or organic osmolyte channels and/or by activating signaling pathways involved in RVD. Recent reports (4–16) have demonstrated that cells respond to mechanical stimuli, including osmotic swelling, by releasing ATP. ATP is known to bind to two main classes of purinergic receptors present on the cell plasma membrane; P2Y receptors are G-protein-linked receptors, and P2X receptors are intrinsic ion channels (17Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492Google Scholar). Activation of either class of receptor can result in a transient increase in [Ca2+]i. In a number of cell types apyrase (an ATP/ADP phosphatase) and P2 receptor antagonists such as suramin and PPADS have been shown to inhibit, at least partially, swelling and mechanically stimulated cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals (5Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Google Scholar, 13Oike M. Kimura C. Koyama T. Yoshikawa M. Ito Y. Am. J.

Nakamura K. Hashimoto M. Kunitomo M. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2001; 28: 799-803Google Scholar), thus providing evidence for a link between extracellular ATP release and transient increases in [Ca2+]i. In a study of HTC rat hepatoma cells, Fitz and co-workers (4Wang Y. Roman R. Lidofsky S.D. Fitz J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12020-12025Google Scholar, 6Roman R.M. Wang Y. Lidofsky S.D. Feranchak A.P. Lomri N. Scharschmidt B.F. Fitz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21970-21976Google Scholar) proposed that extracellular ATP, released in response to a decrease in the extracellular osmolality, could act in an autocrine manner by binding to purinergic receptors and thereby stimulating signaling pathways responsible for activating the Cl− efflux required for RVD. A recent report (18Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Google Scholar) demonstrated a rise in [Ca2+]i in HTC cells in response to osmotic swelling and showed that depletion of thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular stores of Ca2+ inhibited both swelling-activated K+ and Cl− currents. In contrast to the findings in other cell types (13Oike M. Kimura C. Koyama T. Yoshikawa M. Ito Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H630-H638Google Scholar, 15Dezaki K. Tsumura T. Maeno E. Okada Y. Jpn. J.

Physiol. 2001; 28: 799-803Google Scholar), however, the rise in [Ca2+]i was not inhibited by either apyrase or inhibitors of purinergic receptors, from which it was concluded that the swelling-induced release of ATP was not responsible for the rise in [Ca2+]i (18Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the relationship between a decrease in extracellular osmolality, extracellular nucleotides, [Ca2+]i, and ion and organic osmolyte efflux in HTC cells. In experiments comparing the actions of three enzyme preparations that hydrolyze ATP, we found that the hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i was inhibited significantly only under conditions in which extracellular ADP as well as ATP was removed efficiently. The hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i in HTC cells was compared with the increase in [Ca2+]i elicited by the addition of ATP, UTP, or ADP to cells in isotonic medium, and the effect of submicromolar concentrations of ATP on the efflux of K+(86Rb+), Cl−(125I−), and the organic osmolyte taurine from cells in isotonic medium was compared with the effect of a decrease in extracellular osmolality. Our results confirm the earlier finding by Roe and colleagues (18Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Google Scholar) that the hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i seen in HTC cells is a consequence of the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. However, our results also show that, in contrast to the conclusion drawn by Roe and colleagues (18Roe M.W. Moore A.L. Lidofsky S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30871-30877Google Scholar), extracellular adenine nucleotides do play a role in this rise in [Ca2+]i and in activating/modulating the consequent volume-regulatory efflux of K+(86Rb+) and taurine, but not Cl−(125I−), from the cells. Fura-2 AM and pluronic F127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Ionomycin was fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem or Sigma. All other biochemicals were from Sigma. Radionuclides 86RbCl, Na125I, and [3H]taurine were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. HTC cells, derived from Morris hepatoma 7288C cells (19Morris H.P. Adv. Cancer Res. 1965; 9: 227-302Google Scholar), were maintained as a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%, v/v), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (0.012% w/v), and streptomycin (0.02% w/v) in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. Isotonic HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) was composed of the following (in mm): HEPES (10Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A.K. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Google Scholar); NaCl (140); KCl (5Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Google Scholar); CaCl2 (1.3); MgCl2 (0.5); glucose (5Schlosser S.F. Burgstahler A.D. Nathanson M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9948-9953Google Scholar), adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The osmolality was measured by freezing point depression in an Advanced Osmometer, model 3D3 (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA) and adjusted to 300 mOsm kg−1 (range of 299–301 mOsm kg−1) with NaCl. The hypotonic (200 mOsm kg−1) solutions used in efflux experiments were prepared as above, except that the NaCl was reduced to 90 mm. For the measurement of [Ca2+]i cells were subjected to a decrease in the extracellular osmolality by dilution of the isotonic HBS with a low-osmolality solution (35 mOsm kg−1) of the same composition as HBS but from which the NaCl was omitted. The final (measured) osmolality of the hypotonic medium was, in all cases, within the range 198–204 mOsm kg−1. In experiments in which CaCl2 was omitted from the buffers, the osmolality was adjusted to the required value with NaCl. In experiments in which extracellular Ca2+ was chelated with EGTA at the time of dilution, the low-osmolality solution used to reduce the osmolality to 200 mOsm kg−1 contained 5 mm EGTA, and the concentration of the other components was reduced by 50% so that the osmolality of the diluting solution remained in the range 33–35 mOsm kg−1. The final concentration of EGTA in the extracellular solution was 1.84 mm and that of free Ca2+ (estimated using a program based on the equations described in Ref. 20Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Google Scholar) was 50 nm. Apyrase (grade VII and VI) and hexokinase (type F) were each dissolved in water at a concentration of 2000 units/ml and stored as aliquots at −20 °C. Solutions of 100× the final required concentration were prepared in HBS and in the appropriate NaCl-reduced HBS solutions on the day of the experiment. ATP, ADP, 2-MeSADP, PPADS, and A2P5P were prepared as stock solutions in water at 5–50 mm. Frozen aliquots were thawed on the day of use and kept on ice. ADP was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h with hexokinase (20 units/ml) and glucose (20 mm) in order to remove contaminating ATP. Ionomycin and thapsigargin were prepared as 10 and 2 mm stocks, respectively, in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored as aliquots at −20 °C. Fura-2 AM was prepared on the day of the experiment as a 10 mmstock in Me2SO. Pluronic F127 (20% w/v) was dissolved in Me2SO and stored at room temperature. HTC cells were grown on glass coverslips (11 × 18 mm, size 0) in 35-mm culture dishes for 24 h at 37 °C, as for cell culture. The cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM (10 μm) in HBS containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 0.02% (w/v) pluronic F127, and 0.02% (v/v) Me2SO for 1 h at room temperature (20–23 °C). The loaded cells were kept for up to 2 h at room temperature in HBS plus 10% FBS for de-esterification of the Fura-2 AM before carrying out fluorescence measurements. The coverslips were washed 4× with HBS before being clamped into a coverslip holder (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and placed in a quartz cuvette, thermostatted at 25 °C. Solutions in the cuvette were stirred throughout the experiment using a magnetic stirrer. Ratiometric measurements of fluorescence were made by exciting Fura-2 at 340 and 380 nm and measuring the emission at 510 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescence spectrometer fitted with a fast-filter accessory. The fluorescence signals at each wavelength were corrected for autofluorescence (i.e. the signal that remained after quenching the Fura-2 fluorescence with 10 mm MnCl2 at the end of each experiment). [Ca2+]i was estimated as described by Grynkiewiczet al. (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) using the following equation: [Ca2+]i =S f,2/S b,2× K d(R −R min)/(R max −R), and assuming a K d of 224 nm (21Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). The parametersS f,2,S b,2, R min, andR max were all estimated in cells treated with 10 μm ionomycin, using the internal calibration procedure described by Kao (22Kao J.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 155-181Google Scholar). S f,2 andS b,2 are the fluorescence emission (at 510 nm) obtained on excitation at 380 nm, after chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA and in the presence of excess Ca2+, respectively. R min andR max are the ratios of the fluorescence emission (at 510 nm) obtained on excitation at 340 nm to that obtained on excitation at 380 nm, following chelation of Ca2+ with EGTA, and in the presence of excess Ca2+, respectively. The maximum increase in [Ca2+]i(Δ[Ca2+]i), occurring in response to different stimuli was calculated by subtracting an average of 15–20 data points acquired immediately prior to the stimulus from an average of 15 data points acquired during the period when the rise in [Ca2+]i was maximal. Total RNA was prepared from HTC cells (∼5 × 106) using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was incubated with oligo(dT)15primer (0.5 μg, Invitrogen) for 10 min at 65 °C in a total volume of 12 μl and then chilled on ice. Dithiothreitol (10 mm, final), dNTPs (500 μm, final), 5× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen) and RNaseOUT ribonuclease inhibitor (20 units, Invitrogen) were added (total volume, 20 μl) and incubated for 2 min at 42 °C. In order to prepare first strand cDNA, Superscript II-RT (200 units, Invitrogen) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C, before terminating the reaction by heating to 75 °C for 15 min. In order to detect any contamination of the RNA by genomic DNA, control incubations were performed in samples in which the reverse transcriptase was omitted. PCRs were carried out for four rat P2Y receptor subtypes, rP2Y1, rP2Y2, rP2Y4 and rP2Y6, as well as for the housekeeping gene actin (using the 5′-primer set, Gene Checker Kit, Invitrogen). The P2Y primers pairs, designed to amplify a 400-bp fragment from each receptor subtype, are shown in Table I. The PCR mixtures contained 2% (v/v) first strand cDNA solution, 100 pmol of each of the sense and antisense primers, 2 units of Taqpolymerase (Qiagen), 20% (v/v) Q solution (Qiagen), and 200 μm dNTPs. The amplification conditions were 2 min at 94 °C, then 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C), and then 10 min at 72 °C. Amplification products were separated on a 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis.Table IPrimer sequences used to amplify 400-bp fragments of rat P2Y receptor subtypesSubtypesAccession no.SequencePrimerNucleotide sequencesrP2Y1U22830984–1003Sense5′-TTATGTGCAAGCTGCAGAGG-3′1364–1383Antisense5′-CGGAGAGGAGAGTTGTCCAG-3′rP2Y2U56839503–522Sense5′-TCCTCTTCCTCACCTGCATC-3′883–902Antisense5′-GCGAAGACGGCCAGTACTAA-3′rP2Y4Y14706597–616Sense5′-CATCAACCTGGTGGTGACTG-3′968–987Antisense5′-ACACATGATACGGCCTGTGA-3′rP2Y6NM 057124776–795Sense5′-AGCATCCTGTTCCTCACCTG-3′1156–1175Antisense5′-CTGCTACCACGACAGCCATA-3′ Open table in a new tab HTC cells (∼2 × 105 cells) were plated in 35-mm dishes and grown for ∼24 h under normal culture conditions before being loaded with radioisotopes for 1–2 h at 37 °C. In some cases86Rb+ and 125I− efflux measurements were carried out using cells dual-labeled with both isotopes (0.3 μCi/ml for 86Rb+ and 5 μCi/ml for 125I−). Taurine efflux measurements were carried out using separate dishes, prepared on the same day, and labeled with [3H]taurine (0.1 μCi/ml). At the end of the loading period extracellular radiolabel was removed by repeated addition then removal of 1 ml of HBS (300 mOsm kg−1; 8–10 times). The flux experiment was then commenced by the careful addition to the cells of 1 ml of HBS (300 mOsm kg−1). After 4–5 min the extracellular solution was transferred to a vial for scintillation counting, and the extracellular solution was replaced by HBS (300 mOsm kg−1) with or without grade VII apyrase or inhibitors. After a further 4–5 min, the procedure was repeated using hypotonic HBS (200 mOsm kg−1) that also contained the appropriate agent. The radioactivity remaining in the cells at the end of the 4–5-min period in hypotonic medium was estimated by lysing the cells with 0.5 m NaOH. Efflux measurements were carried out at room temperature (23 °C) except where specified otherwise. Unidirectional efflux rate constants (k) were calculated using the expression: k = ln(Xt/Xt−1)/Δt, whereX t is the fraction of isotope remaining in the cells at time point (t), X t−1 is the fraction of isotope remaining at the previous time point, andΔt is the interval between the two time points. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For the measurement of [Ca2+]i, “n” refers to the number of coverslips analyzed. For efflux experiments,n refers to the number of different days on which86Rb+ and 125I− efflux were measured (in triplicate), and [3H]taurine efflux was measured (in duplicate). A two-tailed Student's t test of unpaired samples was used to calculate p values for the comparison of [Ca2+]i measurements and of paired samples for efflux rate constants. Results were considered significant if p ≤ 0.05. Estimates of [Ca2+]i in resting HTC cells loaded with Fura-2 were in the range 50–140 nm. When the cells were subjected to a decrease in osmolality, from 300 to 200 mOsm kg−1, [Ca2+]i rose significantly from a mean value of 72 ± 3 nm to a peak of 165 ± 7 nm (n = 42;p < 0.001) at ∼1 min after the reduction in osmolality. The mean maximum increase in [Ca2+]i(Δ[Ca2+]i) was 93 ± 5 nm. Within 6 min the [Ca2+]i levels returned to approximately the pre-stimulus levels. A representative [Ca2+]i trace is shown in Fig.1 A. Smaller decreases in the osmolality gave rise to smaller rises in [Ca2+]i, with significant increases still being observed in response to reducing the osmolality from 300 to 250 mOsm kg−1 (not shown). Grade VII apyrase is an ATP/ADP phosphatase with a low ATP/ADPase ratio. Inclusion of 3 units/ml of this enzyme preparation in the extracellular solution 5 min prior to and during a decrease in the osmolality caused a marked reduction in the hypotonically induced Δ[Ca2+]i to 12 ± 2 nm(n = 10), 13% of the corresponding same-day controls (91 ± 12 nm, Fig. 1 B). In experiments in which the initial resting [Ca2+]i was found to be above 100 nm (in isotonic medium), the addition of apyrase (grade VII) also caused a significant decrease in the resting [Ca2+]i (results not shown), implicating extracellular nucleotides in the elevated resting [Ca2+]i. Grade VI apyrase is an ATP/ADP phosphatase with a high ATP/ADPase ratio. In contrast to the results obtained with grade VII apyrase, inclusion of grade VI apyrase (3 units/ml) did not decrease the hypotonically induced Δ[Ca2+]i. The Δ[Ca2+]i in the presence of grade VI apyrase was 100 ± 15 nm (n = 5), not significantly different from the value of 79 ± 6 nmobserved for the same-day controls (Fig. 1 B). Hexokinase, which reacts with ATP to phosphorylate glucose and form ADP, was also without significant effect on the hypotonically induced Δ[Ca2+]i observed in response to a reduction in the extracellular osmolality (Fig. 1 B). The Δ[Ca2+]i in the presence of hexokinase was 125 ± 20 nm, not significantly different from the 115 ± 20 nm increase seen for the same-day controls (n = 3). The transient increase in [Ca2+]i observed on reduction of the osmolality of the extracellular solution was not due to mechanical disturbance or to the decrease in ionic strength. Addition of an identical volume of isotonic buffer did not alter the measured resting [Ca2+]i nor did the addition of an isotonic mannitol buffer, which maintained osmolality but reduced ionic strength of the extracellular solution (results not shown). The role of extracellular Ca2+ in the hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i was investigated by the following: 1) omitting Ca2+ from the extracellular solution; 2) chelating extracellular Ca2+simultaneously with the reduction in osmolality; and 3) pretreating cells with thapsigargin in order to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores (23Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar) prior to the reduction in osmolality. When HTC cells were placed for 15–20 min, in solutions from which Ca2+ had been omitted, the resting [Ca2+]i decreased to 21 ± 4 nm(n = 10). Under these conditions the Δ[Ca2+]i observed in response to a decrease in the extracellular osmolality from 300 to 200 mOsm kg−1 was reduced to 12 ± 2 nm (n = 6), compared with 94 ± 16 nm (n = 8) for same-day controls in solutions containing 1.3 mmextracellular Ca2+. One possible explanation for this reduction in Δ[Ca2+]i is that extracellular Ca2+ is the major source of Ca2+ required for the Δ[Ca2+]i observed on osmotic swelling. However, when cells that had been subjected to a decrease in osmolality were treated subsequently with thapsigargin in order to release any Ca2+ remaining in the ER Ca2+ stores (23Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Google Scholar), the thapsigargin-induced Δ[Ca2+]i in cells bathed in the Ca2+-free solution (57 ± 6 nm,n = 6) was ∼10-fold lower than that in cells bathed in solution containing 1.3 mm extracellular Ca2+ (680 ± 90 nm, n = 8). Exposure of HTC cells to a Ca2+-free solution therefore caused a marked decrease in the size of the intracellular Ca2+ pool. Representative [Ca2+]itraces are shown in Fig. 2, Aand B. In Fig. 2 C the Δ[Ca2+]i observed in response to a decrease in the osmolality (in cells in both Ca2+-free and Ca2+-containing media) is expressed relative to the Δ[Ca2+]i observed in response to the subsequent addition of thapsigargin. For cells in both solutions the ratio is the same. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the Ca2+ giving rise to the hypotonically induced increase in [Ca2+]i was derived from the ER Ca2+ store. The amount of Ca2+ in this store was reduced substantially when the cells were transferred from a Ca2+-containing to a Ca2+-free medium. Nevertheless, the proportion of the total amount of ER store Ca2+ store that was released in response to a hypotonic shock was the same in each case. In order to confirm that entry of extracellular Ca2+ is not required for the hypotonically induced Δ[Ca2+]i, the normal (1.3 mmextracellular Ca2+) isotonic solution was diluted with a low osmolality solution containing 5 mm EGTA, so that the extracellular concentration of free Ca2+ was reduced from 1.3 mm to ∼50 nm simultaneously with the reduction in osmolality from 300 to 200 mOsm kg−1. A typical trace is shown in Fig.3 A. Under these conditions the decrease in osmolality caused [Ca2+]i to undergo an initial rise of 104 ± 16 nm (n = 6), not significantly different from same-day controls in cells exposed to 1.3 mm free Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). The initial rise was followed by a decrease in [Ca2+]i, to ∼20 nm. When an isotonic solution containing EGTA was added (such that the final free Ca2+concentration was ∼50 nm) there was no increase in [Ca2+]i; [Ca2+]i simply decreased to ∼20 nm(Fig. 3 C), close to the value measured in cells exposed to solutions containing no added Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A). For cells in the EGTA-containing solutions (containing ∼50 nm free Ca2+) the size of the thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ store was reduced ∼10-fold relative to that seen in cells in media containing 1.3 mmfree Ca2+ (compare Fig. 3, A and C, with Fig. 2 B), as was the case when Ca2+ was omitted from the solutions (Fig. 2 A). When thapsigargin (200 nm) was added to HTC cells bathed in isotonic medium containing 1.3 mm Ca2+, [Ca2+]i increased to a maximum of 1000 ± 40 nm (n = 5) above resting levels and then gradually declined to a value of ∼400 nm after 30 min. A representative Ca2+ trace is shown in Fig. 3 D. When the cells were subjected to a decrease in the extracellular osmolality after 30 min or more in the presence of thapsigargin, [Ca2+]i showed no sign of increasing, again consistent with the thapsigargin-sensitive ER Ca2+ store providing the source of Ca2+ for the hypotonically induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Instead the decrease in osmolality caused [Ca2+]i to decline rapidly to ∼200 nm, as would be expected from a rapid increase in cell volume and consequent dilution of the cytoplasm. The initial decline was followed by a slower increase, probably a consequence of the cells undergoing RVD (Fig. 3 D). Gd3+, a nonspecific inhibitor of stretch-activated non-selective cation channels, as well as of various Ca2+ channels (24Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D.W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252Google Scholar) has been found to inhibit RVD in a number of hypotonically swollen cells including HTC cells (10Roman R.M. Feranchak A.P. Davison A.K. Schwiebert E.M. Fitz J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1222-G1230Google Scholar,25Lippmann B.J. Yang R. Barnett D.W. Misler S. Brain Res. 1995; 686: 29-36Google Scholar, 26Bergeron L.J. Stever A.J. Light D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R801-R810Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that Gd3+ inhibits swelling-activated ATP release with an IC50 of between 10 and 100 μm (8Taylor A.L. Kudlow B.A. Marrs K.L.

Abdullaev I. Maeno E. Tanaka S. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Okada Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 523: 1-11Google Scholar), although the extent to which this is true has recently been questioned. Gd3+ has been found to interfere with the luciferase assay for ATP (28Boudreault F. Grygorczyk R. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C219-C226Google Scholar), and after accounting for this inhibitory action, Maroto and Hamill (29Maroto R. Hamill O.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23867-23872Google Scholar) found that 10 μm Gd3+ reduced mechanosensitive release of ATP from Xenopus oocytes by only 7%. In this study Gd3+, at concentrations as low as 1 μm, reduced the resting [Ca2+]i in HTC cells and inhibited the hypotonically induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Representative traces are shown in Fig.4 A and averaged data in Fig.4 B. 1 μm Gd3+ reduced the hypotonically induced Δ[Ca2+]i to ∼20% of the control value, whereas 10 μm Gd3+completely prevented the hypotonically induced rise in [Ca2+]i. The observation that 1 μm Gd3+ reduced the resting [Ca2+]i in HTC cells is consistent with Gd3+-sensitive Ca2+ influx pathways playing a role in maintaining the normal resting [Ca2+]i of the cells under the conditions used throughout this study. In separate experiments (results not shown) Gd3+ was found to inhibit the ability of extracellular Mn2+ to quench Fura-2 fluorescence in HTC cells under isotonic conditions, consistent with Gd3+ blocking an entry pathway for divalent cations. Gd3+ was also found to reduce the amount of Ca2+ that could be released from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. The Δ[Ca2+]i observed on addition of thapsigargin, 4 min after Gd3+ treatment, was 128 ± 7 nm (n = 3) compared with 1100 ± 80 nm for the untreated control cells (results not shown). These data are consistent with the effect of Gd3+ on the hypotonically induced increase in [Ca2+]i being a consequence of the depletion of the (thapsigargin-sensitive) intracellular Ca2+ stores.

MRP1 is an active transporter of an extremely diverse array of organic anion conjugates as well as a number of anionic non-conjugated compounds. Some of the most well characterized substrates, such as the cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4), are conjugated to glutathione (10Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J.

The transport of GSH can also be stimulated by certain compounds such as verapamil in the absence of net transport of verapamil itself (20Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 2000; 293: 530-538PubMed Google Scholar). MRP1 and its related ABCC proteins, MRP 2, 3, 6, and 7, differ topologically from most eukaryotic ABC transporters. In addition to the two polytopic membrane spanning domains (MSD) typical of ABC transporters, these proteins contain a third NH2-terminal MSD (1Cole S.P.C. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E.

In the case of MRP1 and 2, this domain has been shown to be comprised of five TM helices with an extracellular NH2 terminus (22Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 929-937PubMed Google Scholar). The function of this additional domain is presently not known. However, it has been established that MRP1 retains the ability to transport LTC4 even if this domain is removed (26Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E. Welker E.

Whether this is also true of other substrates, particularly those that depend on GSH for their transport, remains to be established. In most cases, MRP1 substrates compete reciprocally for transport regardless of the identity of the conjugate moiety and the lack of structural similarity of the parental compounds. Some substrates that display GSH dependence for transport also compete with those that do not, although as might be expected their inhibitory potency is increased in the presence of GSH (14Leslie E.M.

These observations suggest that structurally diverse substrates interact with partially shared sets of amino acids that collectively form a binding surface or pocket on the protein. Recent studies indicate that a number of amino acids in predicted TM helix 17 and at least one residue in TM helix 14 are important in determining substrate specificity (28Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C.

Furthermore, it is possible to make compensatory mutations in these two helices, suggesting that they may be in spatial proximity to one another in the native protein (30Zhang D.W. Cole S.P.C.

As an alternative approach to identifying regions of the protein directly involved in substrate binding, MRP1 has been photolabeled by its known high affinity physiological substrate LTC4 as well as by compounds that are less well characterized with respect to binding and transport (10Leier I.

Although these compounds compete with LTC4 for binding to MRP1, their affinities appear to be considerably lower, and they also interact with the distantly related P-glycoprotein. Two of the compounds,125I-labeled N- (hydrocinchonidin-8′-yl)-4-azido-2-hydroxybenzamide (IACI) and iodoaryl azido rhodamine123 (IAARh123), bind to the protein in a GSH-independent manner and label sites in both the NH2- and COOH-proximal halves of the protein (32Daoud R.

Both iodinated compounds have been shown to cross-link preferentially to proteolytic peptides that contain either TM helices 10 and 11 or helices 16 and 17 (31). A third non-physiological compound, an azido derivative of the marine sponge polyhydroxylated sterol acetate, agosterol-A (AG-A), has also been used to photolabel MRP1 (34Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Aoki S.

In contrast to the other compounds, binding of AG-A is GSH dependent, and labeling is restricted to a site in the COOH-proximal half of the protein (34Ren X.Q. Furukawa T. Aoki S. Nakajima T.

On the basis of these results it has been suggested that the site labeled by AG-A has a high affinity for drugs and that GSH binds to a site presumed to be in the NH2-terminal half of the protein, possibly involving the cytoplasmic linker (CL3) region between MSD1 and MSD2 (34Ren X.Q.

However, direct binding studies with photoactivateable derivatives of GSH have not been reported. In this study we have used various combinations of MRP1 fragments co-expressed in insect Sf21 cells together with human and murine hybrid and mutant proteins to investigate the binding of a new and highly specific inhibitor of MRP1. LY475776 is an iodinated azido tricyclic isoxazole that displays essentially complete dependence on GSH for binding to MRP1, and which has a higher affinity for the protein than LTC4 2A. H. Dantzig et al., personal communication. (36Mao Q. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. Lett. 2002; 12: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Concurrent with these studies we have also examined the binding of azidophenacyl-GSH, which we show can effectively support transport of a GSH-dependent substrate such as estrone sulfate as well as the photolabeling of MRP1 by LY475776. We have recently shown by limited trypsinolysis of full-length MRP1 that the major site photolabeled by LY475776 resides in the COOH-proximal segment of MSD3 (36Mao Q. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Using baculovirus co-expressed fragments of MRP1, we demonstrate that both halves of the protein are required for photolabeling of the site in MSD3, although photolabeling can occur in the absence of MSD1 (amino acids 1–203). However, a region in the CL3 connecting MSD1 and MSD2 (amino acids 204–280) is essential for photolabeling. In contrast to the photolabeling profile of LY475776, azidophenacyl-GSH labels sites in both halves of the protein. Labeling of the COOH-proximal site, but not the NH2-proximal site, markedly stimulated the GSH-dependent substrate estrone 3-sulfate. Although CL3 is required for photolabeling of MRP1 by both LY475776 and azidophenacyl-GSH, neither compound photolabels this region of the protein. Finally, we demonstrate that LY475776 has a higher affinity for MRP1 when compared with its murine ortholog mrp1 and identify non-conserved amino acids in MSD3 that contribute to the binding of this compound by the human protein. GSH, 4-azidophenacylbromide, 4-azidophenacyl-GSH, GSH reductase, NADPH, verapamil, and estrone 3-sulfate were purchased from Sigma.

Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, 125 μCi of [35S]GSH was extracted with ethyl acetate to remove dithiothreitol before being added to a reaction mixture containing potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4), 4-azidophenacylbromide (10 mm), GSH reductase (120 milliunits), and NADPH (1 mm). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 22 °C for 1 h, and the products were separated by Silica G thin layer chromatography using 1-propanol/water/acetic acid (12:5:1, v/v). The area on the thin layer chromatography plate containing the radioactivity with an Rf corresponding to unlabeled azidophenacyl-GSH was scraped off and extracted with 400 μl of water six times. The extract was concentrated under a nitrogen stream. Membrane vesicles (75 μg of protein from Sf21 cells or 50 μg of protein from HEK cells in 35 μl of 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH7.4, 250 mm sucrose) were incubated with [125I]LY475776 (0.5 nm) at 37 °C or azidophenacyl-[35S]GSH (0.5μCi) at room temperature for 10 min and UV-irradiated for 5 min at 254 nm or 312 nm on ice, for LY475776 and or azidophenacyl-[35S]GSH, respectively. Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli's buffer and analyzed on a 5–15% gradient gel by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then dried onto blotting paper and exposed to x-ray film at room temperature for detection of [125I]LY475776. For the azidophenacyl-[35S]GSH-labeled proteins, gels were treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film at −70 °C. Exposure times were typically 1–3 days. The ability of [125I]LY475776 to label MRP1 was confirmed using plasma membrane vesicles from Sf21 insect cells and stable transfectants of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the full-length protein. As observed previously using membranes from multidrug resistant H69AR cells, photolabeling was specific for a protein of the anticipated size of MRP1 and was detectable only in the presence of GSH (Fig. 1, A andC, respectively) (36Mao Q. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). No labeling of a comparably sized protein was detected when membranes from cells infected with a control vector encoding β-glucuronidase (β-gus) were used, confirming that the protein was indeed MRP1 (Fig. 1 C). Our recent studies have shown that photolabeling of MRP1 with the high affinity substrate LTC4 results in labeling of a site in the NH2-proximal half of MRP1 and weaker labeling of a site in the COOH-proximal half (27Qian Y.M.

We have also demonstrated that association of the two halves of the protein is a prerequisite for labeling of both sites. To determine whether this was also the case for [125I]LY475776, we examined photolabeling of individually expressed and co-expressed half molecules of MRP1. As observed previously with [3H]LTC4, no binding of [125I]LY475776 was detected when either half-molecule was expressed alone (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the results obtained with LTC4, when the two halves of the protein were co-expressed, labeling occurred predominantly in the COOH-proximal half of the protein in the region extending from amino acid 932 to 1531, consistent with previous trypsinolysis studies using H69AR membranes (36Mao Q. Qiu W. Weigl K.E. Lander P.A. Tabas L.B. Shepard R.L. Dantzig A.H. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). With the co-expressed half-molecules, we also detected very weak labeling of the NH2-proximal portion (Fig. 1 B). Although weak, this labeling was GSH dependent and was enhanced in the presence of S-methyl-GSH, which we have shown previously can substitute for GSH in supporting the transport of some MRP1 substrates (Fig.1 B, right panel) (17Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the weak photolabeling of the NH2-half of the protein appears to be the result of a specific GSH-dependent interaction. Previous labeling and transport studies have shown that MSD1 extending from amino acid 1 to 204 is not required for the binding and transport of [3H]LTC4 (26Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G. Tusnady G.E.

Deletion of part of CL3 between amino acids 204 and 281 essentially abolishes photolabeling of the region containing MSD2 and NBD1, but its removal has less of an effect on labeling of the COOH-proximal site (27Qian Y.M.

Consequently, we examined the extent to which binding and photolabeling with [125I]LY475776 was dependent on the presence of both MSD1 and CL3. MRP1 lacking amino acids 1–204 could be efficiently photolabeled (Fig. 1 C, left panel). However, truncation to amino acid 280 essentially eliminated labeling, and the low level of labeling detected was unaffected by GSH (Fig.1 C). As with LTC4, co-expression of MRP1281–1531 with a fragment comprised of the missing NH2-proximal amino acids restored strong GSH-dependent labeling of the larger fragment despite the fact that LY475776 primarily labels the COOH-proximal region of the protein (Fig. 1 C, right panel). Previous studies have shown that some MRP1 substrates that display a dependence on GSH for transport, such as vincristine, recip"

The 5′ cap structure is recognized by the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)1 4E component of the eIF4F holoenzyme complex (see Ref. 3Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar for review). The eIF4F complex also comprises an ATP-dependent RNA helicase (eIF4A) and a central adapter protein (eIF4G), which binds both eIF4E and eIF4A. The currently accepted model of translation initiation posits that recruitment of the ribosomal 40 S subunit to the mRNA 5′ end requires recognition of the mRNA cap by eIF4E and the simultaneous interaction of both eIF4G and the 40 S subunit with the eIF3 multiprotein complex (reviewed in Ref. 4Hershey J.W.B.

Hillner P.E. Vale R.D. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 135-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) suggest that cap-poly(A) cooperativity somehow results from the physical interactions between the mRNA 5′ and 3′ ends (9Jacobson A.

Gene. 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Indeed, disruption of the eIF4G-PABP interaction abolishes both the positive effects of poly(A) on uncapped mRNA translation in yeast (16Tarun Jr., S.Z. Wells S.E. Deardoff J.A. Sachs A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9046-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and abrogates cap-poly(A) synergy in cell-free mammalian extracts (17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32268-32276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In mechanistic terms, the interaction of wheat germ PABP with eIF4F has been shown to increase the affinity of the eIF4F complex for cap analogue by some 40-fold (18Wei C-C. Balasta M.L. Ren J. Goss D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similarly, the eIF4G-PABP interaction increases the functional affinity of eIF4E for the capped 5′ end of polyadenylated mRNAs in mammalian extracts (19Borman A.M. Michel Y.M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity of eIF4F-complexed plant PABP for poly(A) is significantly greater than that of free PABP (12Le H. Tanguay R.L. Balasta M.L. Wei C.C. Browning K.S. Metz A.M. Goss D.J. Gallie D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16247-16255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems probable that mRNA 5′–3′ end cross-talk enhances translation, at least in part, by stimulating the formation of initiation factor-mRNA complexes. Because this process only requires a series of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions, it could occur, theoretically, in trans.Several further potential translational advantages could be envisaged to result from mRNA circularization. For instance, the PABP-eIF4G interaction would provide a means of tethering the eIF4F complex to a mRNA (albeit at the 3′ end), preventing its dissociation from the message after each initiation event and maintaining an elevated local concentration of eIF4F near the mRNA 5′ end. Noncovalent linking of mRNA ends could also facilitate the recapture of ribosomes that have terminated translation and dissociated from the RNA but remain in its proximity. Obviously, these additional potential advantages of mRNA functional circularization would require that the effects of PABP-bound poly(A) be exclusively intramolecular. In support ofcis-stimulation by poly(A), several studies have shown that the addition of exogenous poly(A) to in vitro translation extracts inhibited translation of all mRNAs, regardless of the nature of the 5′ and 3′ ends (20Gallie D.R. Tanguy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17166-17173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jacobson A. Favreau M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6353-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, one study reported that whereas capped polyadenylated mRNA translation was inhibited by exogenous poly(A), that of capped nonpolyadenylated mRNA was slightly stimulated (∼1.5-fold) at certain poly(A) concentrations (5Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These previous analyses were performed in nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) or in wheat germ extracts, which are far from physiological in reproducing the positive effects of poly(A) on translation. Indeed, in such extracts, poly(A) dependence is rather low and the combined effects of cap and poly(A) on translation are at best additive (17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32268-32276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).We recently described a RRL-based system that faithfully reproduces the synergistic cooperation between the cap and poly(A) for translation initiation by mimicking the competitive environment of the intact cell. Because a competitive environment is assured by rendering translation components physically limiting, rather than by adding excess competitor mRNAs, this system allows the molecular dissection of the functional interactions between mRNA 5′ and 3′ ends (17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32268-32276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Borman A.M. Michel Y.M. Kean K.M.

Here we describe the use of this system for a detailed study of the effect of exogenous poly(A) on translation of mRNAs carrying various combinations of 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail. We demonstrate that poly(A) chains added in trans can dramatically enhance translation of either capped, nonpolyadenylated mRNAs or capped polyadenylated mRNAs carrying poly(A) tails of suboptimal length. As described previously for cap-poly(A) synergy,trans stimulation requires the integrity of the eIF4G-PABP interaction and results at least in part from an increased functional affinity of eIF4E for the 5′ ends of capped nonpolyadenylated mRNAs.RESULTSMany of the mechanisms proposed to underlie cap-poly(A) synergy require that the positive effects of poly(A) tails on translation are restricted to the mRNAs which carry these 3′ tails, that is that translation stimulation by poly(A) is exclusively a cisevent. The aim of the current study was to test this hypothesis. The recently described nuclease-treated, ribosome-depleted RRL translation system is ideal for such a study, because poly(A)-dependence results from physically limiting concentrations of ribosomes and ribosome-associated translation factors rather than the presence of intact, functional competitor mRNAs (19Borman A.M. Michel Y.M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Effectively, functional analyses of the mechanism of poly(A) action are hindered in competitor-based systems by the fact that poly(A)-dependence of the extract is lost as soon as translation conditions are altered (7Preiss T. Hentze M.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 516-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pOp24 plasmids used for the present study have been described elsewhere (17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32268-32276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, the plasmids contain a short oligonucleotide-derived 5′ UTR followed by the region coding for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1Lai) p24 protein and the influenza virus NS 3′ UTR. Three versions of the plasmid differ only by the absence or presence of an A50 or A100 tract downstream of the 3′ UTR (see “Experimental Procedures”).As previously demonstrated (17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32268-32276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 19Borman A.M. Michel Y.M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the effects of capping and polyadenylation on translation of mRNAs derived from the pOp24 plasmids in a standard RRL assay system are at best additive,i.e. the cumulative stimulatory effects of cap and poly(A) are not dramatically greater than the effects of the sum of each modification alone (Table I). However, when the same mRNAs are translated in a ribosome-depleted RRL extract under optimal conditions (Table I; Ref. 19Borman A.M. Michel Y.M. Kean K.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4068-4075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), significant cap-poly(A) synergy is observed. This synergy is typically greater than 5-fold with poly(A) tails of 50 residues and exceeds 10-fold with poly(A100) tails (Table I). Similar poly(A) length-dependent increases in cap-poly(A) cooperativity have been reported in numerous in vitro translation systems (see for example Ref. 25Preiss T. Muckenthaler M. Hentze M.W. RNA. 1998; 4: 1321-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Table IEffects of capping and polyadenylation on mRNA translation efficiency in standard (nuclease-treated) and ribosome-depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysatesCap/poly(A) context1-aRNAs were transcribed with or without cap /with or without a poly(A) tail of 50 or 100 A residues.Translation efficiency of pOp24-derived mRNAsStandard RRLDepleted RRL1-bCap-poly(A) synergy calculated as: stimulation upon capping and polyadenylation divided by [stimulation upon capping added to stimulation upon polyadenylation] is given in parentheses alongside each value for translation efficiency on +/+ mRNA in depleted RRL.

Open table in a new tab Efficient Stimulation of Translation by Free Poly(A) in TransTo examine the potential of polyadenylic acid to stimulate translation efficiency in trans, we employed a commercial poly(A) preparation consisting of poly(A) chains in the approximate range of 15 to 600 residues, present in roughly equimolar proportions (Fig. 1 a, Load lane). This total poly(A) preparation was added at a range of concentrations to translation extracts programmed with Op24-derived mRNAs carrying a cap, a poly(A50) tail or both (Fig.1 b). Added poly(A) significantly inhibited translation of uncapped polyadenylated mRNA even at low concentrations (−/+ lanes). Similarly, translation of capped mRNA carrying an A50 tail was reduced 2–3-fold at low poly(A) concentrations (molar ratios of poly(A):mRNA <1:1) and then slightly but reproducibly stimulated at higher poly(A) to mRNA ratios to return to and even exceed the efficiency observed in the absence of poly(A) addition (Fig. 1 b, +/+ lanes). However, at the highest poly(A) concentration tested, translation efficiency was again suppressed with respect to the control lane (Fig. 1 b, +/+ lanes). Finally, although capped, nonpolyadenylated mRNA translation was unaffected by low concentrations of poly(A), it was dramatically stimulated even to exceed slightly that of +/+ mRNA translated in the absence of added poly(A) when the molar concentration of poly(A) to mRNA exceeded 1:1 (5–8-fold stimulation at poly(A):mRNA ratios of 2.5–10; Fig. 1 b, +/− lanes). Even when the molar ratio of poly(A) to +/− mRNA exceeded 10, although translation stimulation was significantly reduced, absolute efficiency still exceeded that observed in the absence of poly(A) addition.Thus, free poly(A) can dramatically stimulate capped, nonpolyadenylated mRNA translation and also moderately improve the translation of capped mRNAs, which carry short poly(A) tails. It should be noted that the order of addition of mRNA and poly(A) to extracts and the omission of extra Mg2+ ions to compensate for sequestering by poly(A) did not significantly alter the results (data not shown). Additionally, the observed effects were specific to poly(A), as evidenced by the inability of either poly(dA) or poly(U) to effect similar stimulation of translation on either +/− or +/+ mRNAs (Table II). Interestingly, high concentrations of poly(U) dramatically inhibited +/+ mRNA translation, presumably by interacting with the mRNA 3′ poly(A) tail and effectively sequestering this element. Finally, exogenous poly(A) had no discernible effect on mRNA stability in the depleted RRL system (data not shown), which is perhaps not surprising given that poly(A) tails acting in cis stimulate translation in this system without altering mRNA half-life (17Michel Y.M.

In absolute terms, translation of +/+ mRNA was 8-fold more efficient than that of +/− mRNA under the experimental conditions used (final mRNA concentrations of 5 μg/ml). Open table in a new tab Length Dependence of Poly(A) for Trans StimulationTo address the length requirements for this trans stimulation of translation by free poly(A), the original heterogeneous poly(A) preparation was separated electrophoretically, and three distinct populations of different sizes were excised from the gels and purified: 19–52 residues (Pop. 1), 50–180 residues (Pop.2), and 150–400 residues (Pop. 3) (Fig. 1 a; see “Experimental Procedures”). These fractionated poly(A) populations were then each compared at equivalent molar concentrations (with respect to the number of poly(A) chains) with the nonfractionated original preparation for their effects on capped (+/−) and capped poly(A50) (+/+) mRNA translation (Fig.2). Extracts were programmed with 2.5 rather than 5 μg/ml pOp24-derived mRNAs to facilitate the addition of molar excess poly(A). Under these conditions, stimulation of +/− and +/+ mRNA translation with the nonfractionated poly(A) preparation was even more dramatic (14- and 2.5-fold stimulation, respectively, with 2.5 μg/ml of +/− and +/+ mRNAs, as opposed to 5- and 1.5-fold using 5 μg/ml of the same RNAs; compare Fig.1 b and left-hand panel, Fig. 2).Figure 2Trans stimulation of translation by poly(A) is poly(A) chain length-dependent.Ribosome-depleted RRL translation reactions were programmed with 2.5 μg/ml (final RNA concentration) Op24 mRNAs synthesized to contain a cap (+/−) or cap and poly(A50) tail (+/+). Reactions were then supplemented with buffer (0 lanes) or the indicated molar ratios (with respect to programming RNA) of poly(A) pool (Total lanes) or purified poly(A) populations 1, 2, or 3 (see Fig. 1 A, Pop. lanes). MgCl2was added in a 1:1 molar ratio with respect to the added A residues.

Conversely, the addition of poly(A) chains of between 50 and 180 residues affected the translation of both +/− and +/+ mRNAs in a manner similar to that observed with the nonfractionated poly(A) preparation (Pop 2 and Total lanes, Fig. 2), with the exception that +/− mRNA translation was stimulated less efficiently with population 2 poly(A) than with nonfractionated poly(A) at equivalent molar concentrations. Finally, poly(A) chains of 150–400 residues stimulated both +/− and +/+ mRNA translation, albeit less dramatically than the intermediate length chains (Pop 3 and Pop 2 lanes, Fig. 2). However, stimulation of +/− and +/+ mRNA translation was observed at poly(A) to mRNA ratios of less than 1, suggesting that these long poly(A) chains could simultaneously trans-activate the translation of several mRNA molecules. It should also be noted that although the estimated added molar excesses of poly(A) for the different populations are approximations (see “Experimental Procedures”), two independent series of fractionated poly(A) prepared from the same original poly(A) pool gave virtually identical results (data not shown).Effects of Exogenous Poly(A) Chains on the Dose Responses of mRNAs Translated in Depleted RRLOne of the features of translation in the ribosome-depleted RRL system is that the translation extracts are much more rapidly saturated by capped, polyadenylated than by capped, nonpolyadenylated mRNAs (Ref. 17Michel Y.M.

Effectively, a poly(A) tail actingin cis causes a displacement in the dose response of a capped mRNA, without actually increasing the yield of translation product obtained from the RNA under saturating conditions. Thus, the effects of exogenous poly(A) chains on the dose responses of capped, nonpolyadenylated and capped, polyadenylated mRNAs were determined. Exogenous poly(A) chains did not increase the absolute yield of translation product from either +/− or +/+ mRNAs, but rather they behaved like a poly(A) tail acting in cis, provoking saturation of the translation extracts at significantly reduced mRNA concentrations (Fig. 3). Indeed, translation of +/+ mRNA at the highest RNA concentrations tested was actually inhibited by the addition of exogenous poly(A), presumably because the exogenous poly(A) was acting to render the concentration of mRNA saturating.Figure 3Effects of exogenous poly(A) on the dose responses of mRNAs translated in depleted RRL. Ribosome-depleted RRL translation reactions were programmed with (from left to right) 12, 6, 3, or 1.5 μg/ml of Op24 mRNAs synthesized to contain a cap (+/−) or cap and poly(A50) tail (+/+) as indicated. Reactions then received H100 buffer (− panels) or a constant 4-fold molar excess (with respect to mRNA) of population 2 poly(A) chains in H100 buffer (+ panels). MgCl2 was added in a 1:1 molar ratio with respect to the added A residues in the poly(A) population. Analysis of translation efficiency was exactly as described in the legend for Fig. 1; translation efficiency (in arbitrary units) is plotted beloweach panel. Open and filled circles (+/− mRNA) and squares (+/+ mRNA) correspond, respectively, to reactions without and with exogenous poly(A).

Cap-poly(A) synergy was abolished when extracts were incubated with a fragment of the rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3, which interacts with eIF4G and displaces PABP from the eIF4F complex (17Michel Y.M.

Thus, we evaluated whether trans stimulation of translation by poly(A) also depended on the eIF4G-PABP interaction. To this end, translation extracts were pretreated with NSP3 fragment or with control buffer, programmed with +/− or +/+ poly(A50) mRNAs and then supplemented with different amounts of 50–180 residue poly(A) chains. Inclusion of NSP3 fragment at 10 μg/ml, a concentration previously determined to be sufficient to disrupt the eIF4G-PABP interaction (Ref. 17Michel Y.M. Poncet D. Piron M. Kean K.M. Borman A.M. J.

However, NSP3 did not neutralize the inhibitory effects of low concentrations of poly(A) on +/+ mRNA translation.Figure 4Trans stimulation of translation by free poly(A) requires the eIF4G-PABP interaction.

Ark promotes migration of GnRH neurons via Rac GTPase and concomitantly suppresses GnRH gene expression via homeodomain and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) transcription factors. Here, we investigated the signaling cascade required for Ark inhibition of the GnRH promoter in GT1-7 GnRH neuronal cells. Ark repression was blocked by the MEK/ERK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, and dominant negative MEK1 but was unaffected by dominant negative Ras. Inhibitors of the Rho family GTPases, Clostridium difficile toxin B (Rho/Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor) and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (Rac/Cdc42 inhibitor), blocked Ark inhibition of GnRH transcription.

Like Ark, a constitutively active mutant of Rac suppressed GnRH transcription in an ERK-dependent manner. Finally, Ark-mediated repression was significantly attenuated by a dominant negative MEF2C, whereas repression induced by constitutively active Rac was unaffected, indicating that MEF2 proteins are not targets of the Ark → Rac → MEK → ERK cascade.

First, Gas6 promotes survival of Ark-expressing GnRH neuronal cells (5Allen M.P. Zeng C. Schneider K. Xiong X. Meintzer M.K. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Varnum B. Heidenreich K.A. Wierman M.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Second, Gas6/Ark signaling stimulates GnRH neuronal chemotaxis via activation of the Rho family GTPase, Rac (7Allen M.P. Linseman D.A. Udo H., Xu, M. Schaack J.B. Varnum B. Kandel E.R. Heidenreich K.A. Wierman M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 599-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). And third, our studies indicate that while promoting GnRH neuronal survival and migration, Ark concomitantly acts to suppress expression of GnRH. The latter occurs via the actions of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins and a putative homeodomain transcription factor within the proximal GnRH promoter (6Allen M.P., Xu, M. Zeng C. Tobet S.A. Wierman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39662-39670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the current study, we further investigated Ark regulation of the GnRH gene by defining the signaling cascade(s) involved. The results illustrate that Ark-mediated suppression of GnRH gene expression requires Rac GTPase and the downstream activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Although MEF2 proteins are required for Ark repression of the GnRH promoter, our studies indicate that they are not effectors of the Ark → Rac → ERK cascade and therefore may be engaged via a parallel but essential pathway. Given that Rac GTPase is required for Ark regulation of both migration and GnRH gene expression, these studies further suggest that Rac is a proximal and fundamental coordinator of Ark signaling in GnRH neuronal cells.DISCUSSIONGas6/Ark signaling influences a variety of cellular functions including cell growth, survival, adhesion, and migration. We and others have recently begun to explore the nuclear targets of Ark/Axl receptor signaling. Gas6 induces expression of the class A scavenger receptor, an important mediator in atherogenesis, via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway (39Ming C.W. Murao K. Imachi H. Sato M. Nakano T. Kodama T. Sasaguri Y. Wong N.C. Takahara J. Ishida T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1592-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The antiapoptotic effects of Gas6 in NIH3T3 cells are mediated by the transcription factor NFκB and also through a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt dependent mechanism (40Demarchi F. Verardo R. Varnum B. Brancolini C. Schneider C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31738-31744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gas6 stimulates mesangial cell proliferation via activation of the transcription factor, STAT3 (58Yanagita M. Arai H. Nakano T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Fukatsu A. Doi T. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42364-42369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our previous work demonstrated that Ark suppression of neuronal GnRH gene expression requires the coordinated activities of both MEF2 and homeodomain proteins within the proximal rat GnRH promoter (6Allen M.P., Xu, M. Zeng C. Tobet S.A. Wierman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39662-39670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The focus of the current study was to identify the signaling pathway(s) engaged by Ark to repress expression of GnRH. The results illustrate that the ERK pathway is required for Ark-mediated GnRH promoter inhibition. Of interest, Ras, a common activator of the ERK pathway, is not required for the Ark effect on the GnRH gene. This latter finding was somewhat surprising given that the mitogenic effects of Gas6/Axl signaling in NIH3T3 cells require Ras activity (26Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gas6-mediated proliferation of C57 mammary cells involves activation of the ERK pathway, presumably via upstream signals emerging from Ras (23Goruppi S. Chiaruttini C. Ruaro M.E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 902-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous studies showing Gas6-mediated GnRH neuronal survival in the absence of proliferative signals (5Allen M.P. Zeng C. Schneider K. Xiong X. Meintzer M.K. Bellosta P. Basilico C. Varnum B. Heidenreich K.A. Wierman M.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the current data may reflect cell type-specific differences in coupling of Ark/Axl family receptors to Ras.Members of the Rho family of monomeric GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are best recognized for their effects on the actin cytoskeleton. Via the activation of downstream effectors, Rho GTPases control cell shape and movement (59Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). In addition, however, these proteins regulate the cell cycle, gene transcription, and cell survival (60Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar, 61Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 62Linseman D.A.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we examined a potential role for Rac in Ark-mediated GnRH promoter suppression. The Rho family selective inhibitors, toxin B and lethal toxin, both blunted Ark repression of the GnRH promoter, thus implicating Rac in the signaling pathway. Moreover, Ark stimulated Rac activation, and dominant negative Rac attenuated both Ark activation of ERK and Ark repression of the GnRH promoter, demonstrating a critical role for Rac in coupling Ark to ERK activation. Finally, constitutively active Rac mimicked Ark repression of GnRH and was also dependent on ERK. Hence, Ark repression of the GnRH promoter occurs via a Rac → MEK → ERK pathway.Both receptor tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to activate ERK downstream of Rac (44Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 45Frost J.A., Xu, S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell.

Our studies indicate that Ark/Axl family receptors are capable of activating the Rac → ERK pathway in the absence of additional signals from the Ras → Raf-1 pathway. Coupled with our recent studies showing the requirement of Rac in Gas6/Ark-induced GnRH neuronal migration (7Allen M.P. Linseman D.A. Udo H., Xu, M. Schaack J.B. Varnum B. Kandel E.R. Heidenreich K.A. Wierman M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 599-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the data suggest that Rac coordinates a variety of Ark signaling pathways in GnRH neurons.The downstream effects of Rac on gene transcription have only recently been explored. For instance, Rac activates transcription factors including NFκB, cyclin D1, SRF, and NFAT, resulting in increased gene transcription (63Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 64Page K., Li, J. Hodge J.A. Liu P.T. Vanden Hoek T.L. Becker L.B. Pestell R.G. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. J.

Regarding transcriptional repression, lipopolysaccharide-mediated down-regulation of the scavenger receptor class BI gene is mediated via a Rac-dependent mechanism (67Hullinger T.G. Panek R.L., Xu, X. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46807-46814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, other than GnRH, scavenger receptor class BI is the only other gene known to be negatively regulated by Rac GTPase.Rac-mediated potentiation of the ERK pathway has been proposed to occur via two potential mechanisms. Rac may activate ERK by increasing the phosphorylation of Raf-1 on serine 338, a residue important for full Raf-1 activation, and/or by increasing the association of MEK1 with Raf-1, via phosphorylation of serine 298 on MEK1 (44Frost J.A.

Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both serine phosphorylations are mediated by members of the Pak family, which are well characterized Rac-specific effector proteins (55Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 56Knaus U.G. Bokoch G.M. Int. J. Biochem.

With respect to Ark/Axl signaling, Rac has recently been implicated upstream of Pak1 in Gas6-induced survival of NIH3T3 fibroblast cells (26Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although GnRH promoter blockade was recapitulated by a constitutively active Rac mutant (RacQ61L), a constitutively active form of Pak1 (Pak1T423E) was not sufficient to inhibit GnRH promoter activity in GT1-7 cells. These data are consistent with a mechanism whereby Ark inhibits GnRH gene expression via Rac activation of the ERK pathway but may not require the effector protein Pak1. Further studies are necessary to identify the complement of effectors both upstream and downstream of Rac involved in Ark regulation of the GnRH promoter.Activated ERKs translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate transcription factor substrates resulting in transcriptional induction or suppression (69Whitmarsh A.J.

Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because our previous studies implicated MEF2B/2C in Ark repression of the GnRH promoter, we postulated that MEF2 proteins were the nuclear targets of activated ERK. Although a constitutively active mutant of Rac (RacQ61L) blunted GnRH promoter activity via an ERK-dependent mechanism, a dominant interfering MEF2C mutant (MEF2C-S387A) had no effect on Rac inhibition of the promoter, although it blunted Ark repression substantially. These data suggested that MEF2 proteins are not targets of the Ark → Rac → ERK signaling pathway in GnRH neuronal cells and furthermore that Rac-independent pathways may be involved in Ark signaling.Given that Ark suppression of GnRH gene transcription requires a complement of MEF2 and homeodomain proteins (6Allen M.P., Xu, M. Zeng C. Tobet S.A. Wierman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39662-39670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), our studies point to the homeoprotein as the potential ERK substrate in the nucleus. Consistent with this hypothesis, Missero et al. (74Missero C. Pirro M.T. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that the transcriptional activity of the homeodomain protein TTF-1, a thyroid-specific transcription factor, is inhibited via Ras activation of the ERK pathway. Activation of the Ras → Raf-1 → MEK → ERK pathway in thyroid cells results in phosphorylation of TTF-1 on three serine residues followed by a striking decrease in TTF-1-mediated transcription. Interestingly, Ras suppresses TTF-1 transcriptional activity without altering its ability to bind DNA (75Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Ark-expressing GnRH neuronal cells, inhibition of ERK activity with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, does not alter DNA binding of the putative homeoprotein. 2M. P. Allen, unpublished observations. Therefore, ERK phosphorylation of the homeoprotein may alter its ability to interact with accessory proteins such as the MEF2s or perhaps the basal transcriptional machinery. Thus, the focus of future studies lies in the identification of the homeoprotein(s) required for the effect of Ark on GnRH gene transcription and whether it is a direct substrate for the Rac → MEK → ERK pathway identified in this report. In addition, further studies are necessary to determine whether MEF2s are recruited to the promoter by a parallel Ark pathway or perhaps via the target of the Rac → ERK cascade (see Fig. 8 B).In summary, Ark repression of GnRH gene transcription occurs through two coordinated events, one involving activation of a Rac → MEK → ERK signal and the other involving a MEF2 pathway. Collectively, our studies suggest that in addition to promoting GnRH neuronal migration and survival, one function of Ark in the developing GnRH neuron may be to repress the differentiated phenotype (i.e. level of GnRH expression) until the neurons reach their final destination in the hypothalamus. Given the critical role of GnRH in establishing reproductive competence, elucidation of mechanisms that impinge upon GnRH expression, such as that induced by Ark, is of great importance to our understanding of reproductive physiology. The hypothalamic peptide gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)1 plays an essential role in normal reproductive function through its actions on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. During development, GnRH-producing neurons migrate from the olfactory placode, through the nasal cavity, and across the cribriform plate (nose-brain border) to their final destination in the hypothalamus (1Wray S.

Although GnRH expression is tightly controlled during development, puberty, and in the adult, the underlying mechanisms involved in its regulation remain unknown. We and others have used immortalized GnRH neuronal cell lines that retain properties of in vivo GnRH neurons to study GnRH neuronal physiology (5Allen M.P. Zeng C. Schneider K. Xiong X. Meintzer M.K.

The GT-1 cells (and subclones GT1-1, GT1-3, and GT1-7) were isolated from an SV40 T antigen-targeted hypothalamic tumor of postmigratory GnRH neurons, whereas the GN10, GN11, and NLT GnRH neuronal cells were derived from an olfactory tumor of migratory arrested GnRH neurons (11Mellon P.L.

In response to stress signals, including virus infection, the normally latent PKR becomes activated through autophosphorylation and dimerization and phosphorylates the eIF2α translation initiation factor subunit, leading to an inhibition of mRNA translation initiation. While numerous virally encoded or modulated proteins that bind and inhibit PKR during virus infection have been studied, little is known about the cellular proteins that counteract PKR activity in uninfected cells. Overexpression of PKR in yeast also leads to an inhibition of eIF2α-dependent protein synthesis, resulting in severe growth suppression. Screening of a human cDNA library for clones capable of counteracting the PKR-mediated growth defect in yeast led to the identification of the catalytic subunit (PP1C) of protein phosphatase 1α. PP1C reduced double-stranded RNA-mediated auto-activation of PKR and inhibited PKR transphosphorylation activities. A specific and direct interaction between PP1C and PKR was detected, with PP1C binding to the N-terminal regulatory region regardless of the double-stranded RNA-binding activity of PKR. Importantly, a consensus motif shared by many PP1C-interacting proteins was necessary for PKR binding to PP1C. The PKR-interactive site was mapped to a C-terminal non-catalytic region that is conserved in the PP1C2 isoform. Indeed, co-expression of PP1C or PP1C2 inhibited PKR dimer formation in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, co-expression of a PP1C mutant lacking the catalytic domain, despite retaining its ability to bind PKR, did not prevent PKR dimerization. Our findings suggest that PP1Cmodulates PKR activity via protein dephosphorylation and subsequent disruption of PKR dimers.

Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A major control mechanism for this cellular stress response involves protein phosphorylation of the α subunit of the translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) on serine 51 (reviewed in Ref. 2Hershey J. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 139-172Google Scholar). When bound to GTP, eIF2 promotes the assembly of the translation initiation complex between Met-tRNAi and the 40 S ribosomal subunit, a process that results in GTP hydrolysis and an eIF2-GDP complex. Phosphorylation of eIF2α subverts the recycling step required for the formation of an active eIF2-GTP complex, thereby reducing the rate of mRNA translation initiation and, ultimately, an inhibition of global cellular protein synthesis. At least four structurally related serine/threonine protein kinases, each responding to specific stress stimuli, phosphorylate eIF2α (reviewed in Ref. 3Dever T.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 398-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar): the yeast GCN2 kinase, activated by amino acid starvation; the reticulocyte-specific HRI kinase, activated by heme depletion; the endoplasmic reticulum-associated PERK/PEK kinase, activated by stresses that impair protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum; and the interferon (IFN)1-inducible PKR serine/threonine kinase, activated primarily by virus infection. The PKR protein kinase is one of the few well characterized IFN-induced gene products that directly mediate the antiviral effects of IFNs (reviewed in Ref. 4Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 545-556Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PKR is ubiquitously expressed but is normally inactive, presumably because the ATP-binding site or the catalytic domain of PKR is masked by intramolecular interactions (5Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Carpick B.W. Graziano V. Schneider D. Maitra R.K. Lee X. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9510-9516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Upon binding to dsRNA, or to RNA with secondary structures similar to viral replicative intermediates, PKR is autophosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues, which may induce a conformational change that leads to the disclosure of the ATP-binding site and/or the catalytic domain. This is followed by PKR dimerization, which is thought to promote the intermolecular autophosphorylation of PKR molecules, resulting in maximal activation of the enzyme (7Kostura M. Mathews M.B. Mol.

Binding to dsRNA may also serve to recruit PKR molecules to the ribosomes for localized action, where phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR leads to a block in global protein synthesis, ultimately limiting virus replication within the infected cell (11Vattem K.M.

The important role of PKR in host innate immunity is underscored by the numerous strategies employed by different viruses to antagonize PKR (4Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 545-556Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice devoid of functional PKR display increased susceptibility to infection by some viruses (13Yang Y.L.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 545-556Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The translational inhibitory and pro-apoptotic properties of PKR have led to the suggestion that PKR may be a tumor suppressor. Indeed, overexpression of PKR is growth-suppressive in insect, yeast, and mammalian cells (19Barber G.N. Tomita J. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E.F. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G.

Although the exact mechanisms are still not clear, PKR may function through its ability to regulate transcription factors NFκB (27Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl.

While viral studies have revealed different strategies for PKR countermeasures, including the inhibition of dsRNA-mediated activation of PKR, the interference with PKR dimerization process, and the degradation of PKR protein (4Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 545-556Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the regulation of PKR by post-translational protein modifications in uninfected cells is poorly understood. Of particular interest to this study is the modulation of PKR by reversible protein phosphorylation, which is widely used for rapid signal desensitization of enzymes and central to many signal transduction pathways. Previous studies have suggested that a type 1-protein phosphatase (PP1) may be responsible for the inactivation of PKR (33Szyszka R. Kudlicki W. Kramer G. Hardesty B. Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3827-3831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a type 2 PP (PP2) is thought to regulate HRI activity (34Petryshyn R. Levin D.H. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6512-6516Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the exact protein phosphatases involved have not been determined. To gain insights into the cellular mechanisms of PKR regulation, we undertook experiments to identify negative regulators of PKR. To this end, we used a yeast-based functional assay for PKR to screen a human cDNA expression library for clones capable of repressing PKR activity. This screen yielded the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1α or PP1C). Using various in vitro andin vivo assays, we verified the ability of PP1Cto inhibit PKR and further demonstrated a specific and direct interaction between the two proteins. Co-expression of PP1Cinterfered with PKR dimerization, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant PP1C did not. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for tight control of PKR activity and in turn points to a role for PP1C in translational control. For the yeast-based PKR functional assay, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiaeRY1–1 (MAT a, ura3–52,leu2–3, leu12–112, gcn2Δ,trp1-Δ63,LEU::(GAL-CYC1-PKR)2 (provide by Drs. A. G. Hinnebusch and P. R. Romano). For the yeast two-hybrid assay, S. cerevisiae Hf7c (MAT a,ura3–52, his3–200, lys2–801,ade2–101, 112, trp1–901,leu2–3, gal4–542 gal80–538,LYS2::Gal1-HIS3,URA3::(GAL4 17-mers)3-CYC1-lacZ) (CLONTECH) was used. Basic methods for the growth and manipulation of yeast were carried out as described by Romanoet al. (9Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the CLONTECH manual. Reagents for preparation of media were purchased from BIO 101, and media were prepared according to the manufacturer's specifications. A human cDNA expression library in λ YES-R (a gift from Dr. S. J. Elledge) was used to infect Escherichia coli BNN132, and plasmid DNA was prepared as described by Elledge et al. (35Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Purified library plasmid DNA (500 μg) was transformed into RY1–1 cells by the LiAc method as described in the CLONTECH manual. An aliquot of the transformation mixture was plated on 2% raffinose-containing synthetic defined (SD) agar plates lacking uracil (Ura) to determine the transformation efficiency. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells were plated directly on SD-Ura agar plates containing 10% galactose and 2% raffinose. Colonies were picked after 3 to 5 days of incubation at 30 °C. Library plasmids were extracted from the colonies and retransformed into fresh RY1–1 cells to confirm the growth-suppressive rescue phenotype. cDNA inserts from positive clones were then PCR-amplified and categorized based on their restriction enzyme (HaeIII) digestion patterns. A representative cDNA insert from each group was subsequently sequenced using the oligonucleotide 5′-ACTTTAACGTCAAGGAG-3′ for reading from theGAL1 promoter. The GST-PKR fusion construct was obtained from Dr. B. R. G. Williams. Dr. A. E. Koromilas kindly provided the GST-PKR K296R, GST-PKR 1–262, and GST-PKR 263–551 constructs. GST-PP1C2 and GST-PP1C2 181–342 were obtained from Dr. T. Durfee. GST-PP1C was constructed by inserting a 0.9-kb PCR DNA fragment containing the entire coding sequence of humanPP1C, except the first methionine codon, into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The PCR fragment was amplified from the plasmid pRB4891 (provided by Dr. B. He) using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GCACTGAATTCTCCGACAGCGAGAAGCTCAAC-3′ and 5′-GCACTGTCGACATCTGGGGCACAGGGTGGTGT-3′ (restriction sites are underlined). Purification of GST fusion proteins, co-sedimentation, and immunoblotting were carried out as previously described (36Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. Methods. 1998; 15: 207-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The two-hybrid plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424 (CLONTECH) were used for the expression of GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) and GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (GAL4AD) fusions, respectively. pGBT9 and pGAD424 contain the selectable auxotrophic markers, TRP1 andLEU2, respectively. GAL4AD fusions containing different PKR fragments or point mutants were described earlier (37Gale Jr., M.J. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,38Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The PKR mutant, Y167A, in which Tyr-167 was replaced with Ala, was generated by overlap extension PCR using GAL4ADPKR K296R as a template. GAL4ADPKR 1–220 (K64E) and GAL4BDPP2AC were gifts from Dr. G. Sen and Dr. B. Hemmings, respectively. Dr. R. Jagus and Dr. J. Printen provided GAL4BDK3L and GAL4BDPP1C, respectively. GAL4ADSV40 T Ag and GAL4BDP53 were purchased from CLONTECH. The yeast strain Hf7c, which carries the HIS3 reporter fused to a GAL4 promoter sequence, was used to assay for protein-protein interactions as described (37Gale Jr., M.J. Tan S.-L. Wambach M. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4172-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The assay was performed using the λN-PKR-K296R construct as described previously (10Tan S.-L. Gale Jr., M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 38Tan S.-L. Katze M.G. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1998; 18: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST-PP1C fusions were described above. PC168-derived plasmids encoding the λ repressor N-terminal DNA-binding domain (λN) fused with PKR K296R and pGEX2T-derived plasmids encoding GST alone or GST fused with the indicated PP1C proteins were co-transformed into E. coli AG1688 (obtained from Dr. J. C. Hu). Co-transformants were selected on LB plates containing 50 μg of ampicillin and 20 μg of chloramphenicol/ml. Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB supplemented with antibiotics, 10 mm MgSO4, and 0.2% maltose and used to create bacterial lawns on agar containing 100 nm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. Lawns were then spotted with 5-μl aliquots of serial dilutions of a λKH54 phage lysate (109 plaque-forming unit) at 10-fold intervals. Infected lawns were incubated overnight at 30 °C, and the inhibition of dimerization mediated by λN-PKR K296R fusion was scored by the appearance of dot plaques on the lawns. The human hepatoma Huh7 cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein lysates (1 mg, as determined by Bradford Dye Assay; Bio-Rad) were incubated with 2 μg of monoclonal anti-PKR antibody (provided by Dr. T. E. Dever) or 25 μg of normal mouse serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 4 °C, rotating for 2 h in a final volume of 600 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Protein-G-agarose beads (50 μl; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added to the reaction, which was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer containing 0.25% Triton X-100. The bead pellet was boiled in equal volume of 1× Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12%). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with either anti-PP1C (provided by Dr. K. Schlender) or anti-PKR polyclonal primary antibody (19Barber G.N. Tomita J. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E.F. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Virology. 1992; 191: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), followed by donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography of the immunoblots. For PKR in vitro kinase assays, native PKR protein, affinity-purified from IFN-treated human 293 cells, was used (39Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-41554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-PP1C and GST-Tat (obtained from Dr. M. Mathews) proteins were purified as described above. Quantitative SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as a standard was used to determine the concentration of all purified proteins. In vitro kinase reactions were performed essentially as described (10Tan S.-L. Gale Jr., M.J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2431-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that PKR (0.3 μg) was incubated with increasing amounts (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 μg) of purified rabbit PP1C (from Upstate Biotechnology) in a 30-μl phosphatase reaction buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) at 30 °C for 30 min. When indicated, rabbit PP1C, the amino acid sequence of which is identical to human PP1C, was inactivated by the addition of Inhibitor-2 (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PKR was immunoprecipitated from the reaction mixture using a PKR-specific monoclonal antibody (71/10; Ribogene) and subjected to kinase reaction containing [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) and histone H1 (10 μg) in the presence or absence of poly(I·C) (3 μg/ml). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 30-μl 2× sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue). One half of each sample (30 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (14%), followed by autoradiography. To determine PKR activity in vivo, eIF2α phosphorylation within RY1–1 yeast cells harboring various expression plasmids was determined by isoelectric gel focusing and immunoblot analyses as described by Gale et al. (40Gale Jr., M.J. Korth M.J. Tang N.M. Tan S.-L. Hopkins D.A Dever T.E. Polyak S.J. Gretch D.R. Katze M.G. Virology. 1997; 230: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum specific to yeast eIF2α (a generous gift from Dr. T. E. Dever) was used to detect eIF2α by immunoblot analysis. Construction of pYX233-PP1C was achieved by subcloning a 1-kb EcoRI-SalI DNA fragment from GAL4BDPP1C into pYX233 (Novagen) linearized with EcoRI and XhoI. Dr. P. R. Romano provided plasmid p1470, which expresses PKR K296R. The relative levels of protein phosphorylation were determined by quantifying the immunoblots using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (version 5.1). Affinity-purified PKR proteins (0.15 μg) were subjected to autophosphorylation in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer as described above. The reaction mixture was subjected to chromatography using ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Columns according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that the columns were equilibrated with the phosphatase reaction buffer (Upstate Biotechnology) to desalt PKR proteins and to remove free [γ-32P]ATP. Labeled PKR was incubated with 0.1 or 0.2 μg of purified rabbit PP1C(Upstate Biotechnology) in the phosphatase reaction buffer at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated, and the samples were subject to SDS-PAGE (14%) and autoradiography as described above. All DNA constructs were sequenced by the fluorescent dye-terminator method using an Applied Biosystems Model 377 Automated Sequencer (University of Washington). DNA strider and the Wisconsin GCG package (Madison, WI) were used for DNA sequence analysis. To identify novel cellular inhibitors of PKR, we adopted a genetic screening strategy using S. cerevisiae. Overexpression of human PKR protein in yeast cells is lethal because constitutive hyperphosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR leads to severe inhibition of mRNA translation (20Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We reasoned that co-expression of mammalian genes that negatively regulate PKR would suppress the PKR-induced lethality. We used a gcn2Δ yeast strain (RY1–1), which carries two copies of the human PKR allele under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (9Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We chose this strain because PKR protein expression is suppressed when the cells are grown in glucose-containing medium, thus allowing the cells to grow normally. Upon transfer to galactose-containing medium, which induces theGAL promoter and hence PKR expression, these yeast cells cease to grow. We assumed that reversion to normal growth because of mutations would be minimal because the high expression levels of PKR should block cell division, a prerequisite for the generation of mutants. To this end, a galactose-inducible human cDNA expression library was introduced into RY1–1, and transformants that overcame the PKR-mediated growth-inhibitory effect were selected. Plasmids containing cDNAs were extracted from these transformants and retransformed into fresh RY1–1 to verify the reversal of growth arrest phenotype. One of the cDNA clones that reproducibly restored RY1–1 viability on galactose-containing medium encoded the catalytic subunit of type 1 protein phosphatase, PP1C (41Song Q. Khanna K.K., Lu, H. Lavin M.F. Gene. 1993; 129: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, RY1–1 cells grew normally on raffinose medium, on which PKR expression was suppressed (left panel). However, RY1–1 cells were unable to grow when PKR expression was induced on galactose medium (right panel,lane 1). Coexpression of PP1C partially rescued the growth defect of RY1–1 (right panel, lane 2). Because relatively little is known about the cellular mechanisms controlling PKR activity, we chose to investigate the mode of action of PP1C. PP1C could conceivably restore RY1–1 growth on galactose-containing media through pathways that are independent of PKR. To confirm that the effect of PP1C was at least in part specific to PKR, we took note of previous observations that the catalytically inactive PKR K296R is recessive to wild-type PKR in yeast (9Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus reasoned that co-expression of PKR K296R in RY1–1 might reverse the inhibitory effect of PP1C on PKR by sequestering PP1C in nonfunctional PKR K296R-PP1C complexes. Alternatively, PKR K296R might dimerize with PKR, and because these dimers would be functional in yeast, they could titrate out the PP1C. As predicted, the PKR-mediated toxicity was partially restored when PKR K296R was coexpressed with PP1C (Fig. 1 A; right panel, lane 3). PKR proteins in these samples were expressed to comparable levels as shown by immunoblot analysis using a PKR-specific antibody (Fig. 1 B). The more intense PKR band in lane 3 presumably represents the co-migrating wild-type PKR and PKR K296R. These results support our hypothesis that the PP1C rescues RY1–1 from cell growth retardation, at least in part, via the PKR pathway. To examine whether PP1C directly dephosphorylates PKR, we took advantage of the fact that PKR is hyperphosphorylated when expressed in yeast (9Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of protein extracts with excess λ protein phosphatase converted the slower-migrating PKR protein band to a faster-migrating band (lane 2), indicating that the difference of migration was due to differential phosphorylation of PKR (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, co-expression of PP1C with PKR resulted in a similar hypophosphorylated form of PKR (lane 3). Moreover, as a control, expression of the catalytically inactive PKR K296R also produced a faster-migrating band, indicating that PP1Cdephosphorylates PKR (lane 4). Further support for this was obtained by the experimental results shown in Fig. 2 B. Purified PKR proteins were first labeled by autophosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and poly(I·C) and then purified and used as a substrate for PP1C in a phosphatase assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Indeed, PP1C could dephosphorylate PKR in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B, top panel). Western blotting showed that the PKR dephosphorylation was not due to degradation of PKR protein (Fig. 2 B, bottom panel). Certain viruses have evolved pseudosubstrates that compete with eIF2α for phosphorylation by PKR (4Tan S.-L. Katze M.G."

Here we have carried out screening with the c-Yes protein and found that a QM homologous protein showed interactions with c-Yes and other Src family members. We have found that two different regions of QM protein were associated with the SH3 domain of c-Yes. The QM protein does not contain canonical SH3 binding motifs or previously reported amino acid fragments showing interaction with SH3 domains. Several c-Yes kinase activity assays indicated that the QM protein reduced c-Yes kinase activity by 70% and that this suppression is related not only to the two SH3 binding regions but also to the C-terminal region of QM. Moreover, our autophosphorylation assays clarified that this regulation resulted from the inhibition of c-Yes autophosphorylation. Immunofluorescence studies showed that the QM proteins and c-Yes are able to interact in various tumor cell linesin vivo. The increases of the c-Yes protein and mRNA levels were detected when the QM was transfected.

Src homology protein-tyrosine kinase, PBS, phosphate-buffered saline, GST, glutathione S-transferase, SD, synthetic dextrose protein kinase C Luria broth amino acid Src family kinases are involved in many intracellular functions, including cell stability, division, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. c-Yes is one of the Src family kinases and is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues and presumably is involved in many signaling pathways (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). c-Yes has not been studied extensively compared with other members of Src families because of the high similarity to Src. However, various studies demonstrated thatyes and src genes have different characteristics in expression, activity, and function (2Han N.M. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1397-1404PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins have been reported to influence Src family kinase activity (3Fujishima H. Nakano S. Tatsumoto T. Masumoto N. Niho Y. Int. J.

Vergés M. Vaerman J.P. Sudol M. Mostov K.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Src family kinases contain SH31 and SH2 domains that are involved in many protein-protein interactions. SH2 domains usually mediate protein-protein interactions by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or ligands (7Anderson D. Koch C. Gray L. Ellis C. Moran M. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Shima T. Okumura N. Takao T. Satomi Y. Yagi T. Okada M. Nagai K. J. Biol.

Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). They are highly homologous and have diverse mediating roles in protein interactions. SH3 domains are one of the well-characterized protein binding domains. Many studies revealed that they recognize the proline-rich consensus sequence containing the PXXP motif in the context of the left-handed helical polyproline-2 (PPII) helix (10Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Saraste M. Nature. 1992; 359: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D.

Recently, several other SH3-recognizing amino acid sequences, such as RKXXYXXY and WXXQF, have been reported (13Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 2889-2899Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T.J. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and they play a different role in relation to each Src kinase.The QM/Wilms' tumor suppressor gene was first identified from the Wilms' tumor cell line (15Dowdy S.F. Lai K.M. Weissman B.E. Matsui Y. Hogan B.L. Stanbridge E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5763-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and its genomic location was reported within Xq28 (16Kaneko K. Kobayashi H. Onodera O. Miyatake T. Tsuji S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). QM is also highly homologous to the Jun-binding protein (Jif-1) as a putative tumor suppressor (17Monteclaro F.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but it has been observed that QM and Jun have a rare interrelationshipin vivo (18Loftus T.M. Nguyen Y.H. Stanbridge E.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8224-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most QM proteins are localized in the cytoplasm, and subcellular fractionation assays have shown that QM is peripherally localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (19Nguyen Y.H. Mills A.A. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, another study contended that QM was associated with presenilin 1 (PS1) and translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus resulting in suppression of the complex formation of the c-Jun homodimer (20Imafuku I. Masaki T. Waragai M. Takeuchi S. Kawabata M. Hirai S. Ohno S. Nee L.E. Lippa C.F. Kanazawa I. Imagawa M. Okazawa H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In another report, it has been demonstrated that yeast QM homologous genes, such as GRC5 and QSR1, participate in translational control of gene expression in yeast (21Karl T. Önder K. Kodzius R. Pichová A. Wimmer H. Thür A. Hundsberger H. Löffler M. Klade T. Beyer A. Breitenbach M. Koller L. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These are especially required for cell growth and differentiation throughout mRNA translation, because they take part in the recombination of 60 and 40 S ribosomal protein subunits. Several studies showed that QM proteins are expressed in many different species, and sequence analysis has proven that they are highly conserved throughout (22Farmer A. Loftus T. Mills A. Sato K. Neill J. Tron T. Yang M. Trumpower B. Stanbridge E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 723-728Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Embryos and bone development studies indicate that QM proteins are highly expressed in undifferentiated cells, while differentiated and adult tissues tend not to maintain QM proteins (23Eisinger D.P. Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993; 196: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Green H. Canfield A.E. Hillarby M.C. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Freemont A.J.

Differentiation. 1999; 64: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).Despite the importance of QM proteins in cell stability, differentiation, and development, it has not been revealed that QM is involved in intra- or extracellular signaling pathways. In our study, we showed that QM influenced the membrane protein, c-Yes, directly or indirectly. From these results, it was possible to deduce that the QM protein takes part in signal transduction through association to c-Yes. Moreover, since the QM protein also shows interactions with other Src family members, it can be suggested that the QM protein might be an important regulator or mediator of many other SH3-domain-containing proteins and other cytoplasmic molecules, even in translation and transcription processes.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have screened the HeLa cell cDNA library with c-Yes protein and found several c-Yes-interacting proteins. One of them was QM, known as a key protein involved in binding of 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits (34Eisiner D.P. Dick F.A. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5136-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From our binding assays, it has been revealed that two regions of the QM protein are bound to the SH3 domain of c-Yes (Fig. 2, A and B). According to sequence analysis of the QM protein, the RPARCYR (aa 4–10) peptide is the most plausible consensus for the interaction between the QM and c-Yes proteins. Even though the reported environments of the RPARCYR peptide and the SH3 domain of c-Yes did not exactly satisfy each of the binding conditions of the P XXDY peptides or the VPMRLR peptide, we can assume that the concerted conditions of both peptides can be applied to the RPARCYR peptide. It means that the specificity of the RPARCYR peptide might be lower than the P XXDY motif or the VPMRLR peptide. Even though QM also associated with other Src family members, their binding intensities varied. Sequence similarities among the SH3 domains can imply the binding strengths between the QM protein and SH3 domains. The SH3 of Src, Yes, and Fyn shows more similar sequence homologues than those of Lyn or Hck, and our data showed that the SH3 domains of Lyn and Hck produced weaker binding strengths than those of the others. However, the conserved binding regions of SH3 are the same except for the case of Lyn. This means that other factors also contribute to binding strength.Recently, several studies have tried to elucidate the effect of substrate binding in kinase activities. One of the most interesting proteins is the Nef protein of HIV-1, because it has been revealed that Nef induced kinase activity in Hck when Nef is associated with the SH3 domain of Hck (35Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 172: 17699-17902Google Scholar). QM also binds to the SH3 domain of c-Yes but the QM protein showed inhibition of c-Yes activity in contrast to Nef and Hck. The binding of the QM protein to the SH3 domain is important in the inhibition of c-Yes kinase activity, although even more interesting is the fact that the binding region has to be accompanied by the C terminus (144–213) of QM for the complete suppression of c-Yes activity. Although the C terminus of QM was predicted to have a random coiling status, the C terminus was required to block the kinase activity. Therefore, we suggest that because of the C-terminal flexibility, when QM binds to the SH3 domain of c-Yes, the C terminus of QM might be closely located to the PTK domain and stabilize the c-Yes protein in the inactive conformation.Our data suggested that kinase activity and autophosphorylation assays were compatible and that these results clarify understanding of how QM protein regulates c-Yes kinase. In Hck, the Nef protein binds to the SH3 domain and helps induce conformational changes in Hck to easily coordinate ATP (35Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 172: 17699-17902Google Scholar, 36Collette Y. Dutartre H. Benziane A. Ramos-Morales F. Benarous R. Harris M. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6333-6341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This means that conformational changes leading to stability for autophosphorylation induce the activation of Hck when other proteins are associated with the SH3 domain. It can be easily assumed that ligand binding to the SH3 or SH2 domain induces disruption of the inactive state. On the contrary, to stabilize a kinase in the inactive form, QM binding to the SH3 domain has to reduce c-Yes conformational change or disturb active site opening. Such a mechanism was also proven by our in vivo and in vitrostudies. The C terminus of QM protein brought about inhibition of autophosphorylation with support of the SH3 binding domains (QM1 and QM23) of the QM protein (Fig. 8 D). We also performed time-dependent assays. Every 10 min, QM proteins were added during autophosphorylation assays, confirming that the QM addition kept c-Yes from further autophosphorylation (data not shown). From these results, we can suggest that the blocking of autophosphorylation by the QM protein results in suppression of the kinase activity of c-Yes and this might be caused by the conformational change of c-Yes preventing ATP introduction with the support of the C terminus and SH3 binding domains of the QM protein.The data showing the suppression and autophosphorylation inhibition of c-Yes by QM derivatives also indirectly illuminate the QM protein and SH3 domain binding mechanism whereby QM1 and QM23 would not bind to the same site of SH3 of c-Yes. If QM1 and QM23 were associated with the same site of the SH3 domain of c-Yes, they should compete with each other. This would result in similar levels of suppression of kinase activity and autophosphorylation between the incubation of QM1 or QM23 with c-Yes and the incubation of QM3 or QM4 with c-Yes, even though QM3 and QM4 contain two SH3 binding regions of the QM protein. However, our data contradicted the above prediction, and QM3 and QM4 induced 1.5-fold more suppressed c-Yes activity and autophosphorylation than did QM1 or QM23 (Fig. 7, columns 3, 5, 6, and 8 and Fig.8 C). This means that QM1 and QM23 influence c-Yes in their own way, and the binding sites on SH3 might be different as well. Therefore, we suggest two steps in the mechanism of QM and c-Yes interaction: (i) QM holds the c-Yes protein with two different SH3 binding domains, and this initially stabilizes c-Yes in an inactive form. (ii) Finally, the C-terminal region of QM, close to the PTK domain, helps to keep c-Yes in an inactive conformation and completes the blocking of ATP access. To clarify the suppression mechanism, a study of conformational changes is required. For the identification of binding sites between QM and SH3, more specific studies have to be carried out, such as point mutations and/or SPOT tests using synthesized peptides of QM and c-Yes.From previously reported experiments, QM has become known as a candidate for playing a key role in cell signaling and development (37Tron T. Yang M. Dick F.A. Schmitt M.E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9961-9970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,38Dimri G.P. Testori A. Acosta M. Campisi J. Biol. Signals. 1996; 5: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Since the QM protein exists in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5) and c-Yes is one of the membrane proteins (39Sudol M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2839-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Krueger J. Zhao Y.H. Murphy D. Sudol M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 933-940PubMed Google Scholar), QM protein presumably comes into contact with and influences c-Yes in vivo. In the case of QM overexpression, not only c-Yes protein but c-yes mRNA levels increased around 20–40% compared with the control (Fig. 10,A and B). This result demonstrates that the QM protein also has an impact on c-Yes within cells, and we would like to suggest two explanations for this phenomenon. One is that highly expressed QM protein perhaps helps to increase c-Yes translation since QM is one of the critical proteins that participate in 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunit aggregation (19Nguyen Y.H. Mills A.A. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The other explanation is that c-Yes is required more to minimize the effect of suppressed c-Yes activity by QM protein for the maintenance of signal pathways involving c-Yes. For a more detailed explanation, other assays might be required to be performed.Even though further studies are needed to clarify the precise effects and exact mechanism of the interaction between Src family members and the QM protein, our study has presented evidence that the QM protein and c-Yes have a close interrelationship in vitro andin vivo. Src family kinases are involved in many intracellular functions, including cell stability, division, proliferation, migration, and differentiation. c-Yes is one of the Src family kinases and is expressed ubiquitously in most tissues and presumably is involved in many signaling pathways (1Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). c-Yes has not been studied extensively compared with other members of Src families because of the high similarity to Src. However, various studies demonstrated thatyes and src genes have different characteristics in expression, activity, and function (2Han N.M. Curley S.A. Gallick G.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1397-1404PubMed Google Scholar). Several proteins have been reported to influence Src family kinase activity (3Fujishima H. Nakano S. Tatsumoto T. Masumoto N. Niho Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 4Branka K. Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Gardner D.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 176: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and in some cases, binding proteins have different effects on each type of kinase activity (6Luton F. Vergés M. Vaerman J.P. Sudol M. Mostov K.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 627-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Src family kinases contain SH31 and SH2 domains that are involved in many protein-protein interactions. SH2 domains usually mediate protein-protein interactions by tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or ligands (7Anderson D. Koch C. Gray L. Ellis C. Moran M. Pawson T. Science. 1990; 250: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Shima T. Okumura N. Takao T. Satomi Y. Yagi T. Okada M. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are composed of about 60 amino acids and are found in many signaling proteins (9Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). They are highly homologous and have diverse mediating roles in protein interactions. SH3 domains are one of the well-characterized protein binding domains. Many studies revealed that they recognize the proline-rich consensus sequence containing the PXXP motif in the context of the left-handed helical polyproline-2 (PPII) helix (10Musacchio A. Noble M. Pauptit R. Saraste M. Nature. 1992; 359: 851-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 11Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D.

Recently, several other SH3-recognizing amino acid sequences, such as RKXXYXXY and WXXQF, have been reported (13Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 17: 2889-2899Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Bottger G. Barnett P. Klein A.T.J. Kragt A. Tabak H.F. Distel B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3963-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and they play a different role in relation to each Src kinase. The QM/Wilms' tumor suppressor gene was first identified from the Wilms' tumor cell line (15Dowdy S.F. Lai K.M. Weissman B.E. Matsui Y. Hogan B.L. Stanbridge E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5763-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and its genomic location was reported within Xq28 (16Kaneko K. Kobayashi H. Onodera O. Miyatake T. Tsuji S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). QM is also highly homologous to the Jun-binding protein (Jif-1) as a putative tumor suppressor (17Monteclaro F.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6726-6730Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but it has been observed that QM and Jun have a rare interrelationshipin vivo (18Loftus T.M. Nguyen Y.H. Stanbridge E.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8224-8230Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most QM proteins are localized in the cytoplasm, and subcellular fractionation assays have shown that QM is peripherally localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (19Nguyen Y.H. Mills A.A. Stanbridge E.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In contrast, another study contended that QM was associated with presenilin 1 (PS1) and translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus resulting in suppression of the complex formation of the c-Jun homodimer (20Imafuku I. Masaki T. Waragai M. Takeuchi S. Kawabata M. Hirai S. Ohno S. Nee L.E. Lippa C.F. Kanazawa I. Imagawa M. Okazawa H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In another report, it has been demonstrated that yeast QM homologous genes, such as GRC5 and QSR1, participate in translational control of gene expression in yeast (21Karl T. Önder K. Kodzius R. Pichová A. Wimmer H. Thür A. Hundsberger H. Löffler M. Klade T. Beyer A. Breitenbach M. Koller L. Curr. Genet. 1999; 34: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These are especially required for cell growth and differentiation throughout mRNA translation, because they take part in the recombination of 60 and 40 S ribosomal protein subunits. Several studies showed that QM proteins are expressed in many different species, and sequence analysis has proven that they are highly conserved throughout (22Farmer A. Loftus T. Mills A. Sato K. Neill J. Tron T. Yang M. Trumpower B. Stanbridge E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 723-728Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Embryos and bone development studies indicate that QM proteins are highly expressed in undifferentiated cells, while differentiated and adult tissues tend not to maintain QM proteins (23Eisinger D.P. Jiang H.P. Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1993; 196: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Green H. Canfield A.E. Hillarby M.C. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Freemont A.J.

Differentiation. 1999; 64: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of QM proteins in cell stability, differentiation, and development, it has not been revealed that QM is involved in intra- or extracellular signaling pathways. In our study, we showed that QM influenced the membrane protein, c-Yes, directly or indirectly. From these results, it was possible to deduce that the QM protein takes part in signal transduction through association to c-Yes. Moreover, since the QM protein also shows interactions with other Src family members, it can be suggested that the QM protein might be an important regulator or mediator of many other SH3-domain-containing proteins and other cytoplasmic molecules, even in translation and transcription processes. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have screened the HeLa cell cDNA library with c-Yes protein and found several c-Yes-interacting proteins. One of them was QM, known as a key protein involved in binding of 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits (34Eisiner D.P. Dick F.A. Trumpower B.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5136-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). From our binding assays, it has been revealed that two regions of the QM protein are bound to the SH3 domain of c-Yes (Fig. 2, A and B). According to sequence analysis of the QM protein, the RPARCYR (aa 4–10) peptide is the most plausible consensus for the interaction between the QM and c-Yes proteins. Even though the reported environments of the RPARCYR peptide and the SH3 domain of c-Yes did not exactly satisfy each of the binding conditions of the P XXDY peptides or the VPMRLR peptide, we can assume that the concerted conditions of both peptides can be applied to the RPARCYR peptide. It means that the specificity of the RPARCYR peptide might be lower than the P XXDY motif or the VPMRLR peptide. Even though QM also associated with other Src family members, their binding intensities varied. Sequence similarities among the SH3 domains can imply the binding strengths between the QM protein and SH3 domains. The SH3 of Src, Yes, and Fyn shows more similar sequence homologues than those of Lyn or Hck, and our data showed that the SH3 domains of Lyn and Hck produced weaker binding strengths than those of the others. However, the conserved binding regions of SH3 are the same except for the case of Lyn. This means that other factors also contribute to binding strength.Recently, several studies have tried to elucidate the effect of substrate binding in kinase activities. One of the most interesting proteins is the Nef protein of HIV-1, because it has been revealed that Nef induced kinase activity in Hck when Nef is associated with the SH3 domain of Hck (35Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 172: 17699-17902Google Scholar). QM also binds to the SH3 domain of c-Yes but the QM protein showed inhibition of c-Yes activity in contrast to Nef and Hck.

The other explanation is that c-Yes is required more to minimize the effect of suppressed c-Yes activity by QM protein for the maintenance of signal pathways involving c-Yes. For a more detailed explanation, other assays might be required to be performed. Even though further studies are needed to clarify the precise effects and exact mechanism of the interaction between Src family members and the QM protein, our study has presented evidence that the QM protein and c-Yes have a close interrelationship in vitro andin vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2014125089,"Diabetes causes accelerated atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We have previously shown, using a porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, that diabetes leads to an increased accumulation and proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions and that this is associated with elevated levels of plasma triglycerides. We therefore used the same model to investigate the mechanism whereby diabetes may stimulate smooth muscle cell proliferation. We show that lesions from diabetic pigs fed a cholesterol-rich diet contain abundant insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), in contrast to lesions from non-diabetic pigs. Furthermore, two fatty acids common in triglycerides, oleate and linoleate, enhance the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I in smooth muscle cells isolated from these animals. These fatty acids accumulate predominantly in the membrane phospholipid pool; oleate accumulates preferentially in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, whereas linoleate is found mainly in phosphatidylethanolamine. The growth-promoting effects of oleate and linoleate depend on phospholipid hydrolysis by phospholipase D and subsequent generation of diacylglycerol. Thus, concurrent increases in levels of IGF-I and triglyceride-derived oleate and linoleate in lesions may contribute to accumulation and proliferation of smooth muscle cells and lesion progression in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis.

Haudenschild C. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1984; 26: 373-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis remain to be elucidated. A recently developed porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis demonstrates that the increased progression of atherosclerosis in diabetes is associated with increases in plasma triglycerides and blood glucose (2Gerrity R.G. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Kimsey T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We have shown that in this model, diabetes leads to accumulation and proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs)1 in fibroatheromas and that high glucose levels are unable to directly increase proliferation of SMCs isolated from these pigs (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, while diabetes increases the accumulation of SMCs in the atherosclerotic lesion, this appears to be independent of a direct growth-promoting effect of glucose. Our studies therefore focused on the association between elevated plasma triglycerides and lesion SMC proliferation in diabetes. There is strong evidence that higher plasma concentrations of fatty acids, a principal component of triglycerides, are correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (4Cullen P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2000; 86: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and are commonly present in humans and animals with diabetes (2Gerrity R.G. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Kimsey T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Erkelens D.W. Eur. Heart. J. 1998; 19 Suppl. H: H27-H40PubMed Google Scholar). The major fatty acids in plasma triglycerides are palmitic acid (16:0), linoleic acid (cis18:2), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (cis 18:1), and arachidonic acid (cis 20:4). The results of this study show that IGF-I, a SMC growth factor (6Bayes-Genis A. Conover C.A. Schwartz R.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), is abundant in lesions of atherosclerosis from diabetic pigs, whereas lesions from non-diabetic pigs contain little IGF-I. Furthermore, oleic acid (OA) and linoleic acid (LA) markedly enhance the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I through a phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent pathway in SMCs isolated from these animals. We propose that the increased SMC proliferation seen in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis is, at least in part, caused by an increase in IGF-I-induced PLD activity and subsequent generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) fueled by the elevated levels of triglycerides containing OA and LA. Sodium salts of OA, LA, palmitic, arachidonic (AA), elaidic (EA), stearic acids (SA), and conjugated LA were purchased from Nucheck Prep (Elysian, MN). Human recombinant IGF-I was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). [3H]Thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]LA (55.0 mCi/mmol) and [14C]OA (56 mCi/mmol) were obtained from AmershamBiosciences. BSA, indomethacin, OA-CoA, LA-CoA, and a monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. Propranolol, atenolol, ONO-RS-082, U73312, U73343, R59022, L655238, baicalein, Wy-14643, LY294002, and wortmannin were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 1-Butanol and 2-butanol were purchased from Fisher. All inhibitors were used at selective concentrations that did not result in cytotoxicity. Anti-phospho(S473)-PKB/AKT, anti-PKB/AKT, anti-phospho(T421/S424)-p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), anti-phospho-(T202/Y204)ERK antibodies, and anti-IGF-I receptor β-subunit antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Anti-p70S6K antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK antibody (7884) generated against the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subdomain-XI peptide RRITVEALAHPYLEQYYDPTDE was generously provided by Dr. Edwin G. Krebs. The porcine model of streptozotocin diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis has been described in detail previously (2Gerrity R.G. Natarajan R. Nadler J.L. Kimsey T. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1654-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fixed segments obtained from the area between the third and forth intercostal artery of the thoracic aorta were embedded in paraffin and cut into sections. The sections were prepared for immunohistochemistry as described previously (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive IGF-I was detected using a monoclonal anti-IGF-I antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. A control antibody of the same subclass (IgG1) and concentration was used as a negative control (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). IGF-I immunoreactivity was visualized by using an alkaline phosphatase kit (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta (between the third and forth intercostal artery) of non-diabetic pigs fed a chow diet via an explant method (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Passages 4–11 were used for experiments. Prior to all experiments, the SMCs were made quiescent by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 48 h. All experiments were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5.6 mm glucose + 0.5% fatty acid-free-BSA. These conditions did not reduce cell viability or induce toxicity. Sodium salts of fatty acids were dissolved in distilled H2O (50 mg/ml) and diluted in sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 0.5% fatty acid-free-BSA (78 μm) to a final concentration of 70 μm. This mixture was equilibrated for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 prior to addition to the cells, allowing BSA–fatty acid complexes to form. This method has been estimated to result in an effective free fatty acid concentration in the nanomolar range (7Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The concentrations of fatty acid and BSA were based on a physiological ratio between fatty acid and the carrier protein (BSA) and the concentration of albumin present in the extracellular fluid of the intimal portion of the arterial wall (8Smith E.B. Staples E.M. Atherosclerosis. 1980; 37: 579-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). SMC proliferation was measured as [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and determination of cell number, as described previously (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Expression of the IGF-I receptor β-subunit and phosphorylation of downstream kinases were analyzed by immunoblotting. SMCs were stimulated with fatty acids and/or IGF-I for the indicated periods of time. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (9Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Leslie C.C. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), separated using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a 1:5000 dilution. Signal detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of fatty acid incorporation into membrane phospholipids was achieved via high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). SMCs in 100-mm dishes were labeled with [14C]LA or [14C]OA (3 μCi/plate) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. This procedure resulted in ∼90% incorporation of OA and LA into the cell layer. Membrane lipids were extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer method (10Bligh E. Dyer W. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42389) Google Scholar), and lipid extracts were separated by normal-phase HPLC techniques (11Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Huang D.D Rybalova S. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1696-1702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Reverse-phase HPLC was used to analyze the possible release of hydroperoxy lipids (11Carroll M.A. Balazy M. Huang D.D Rybalova S. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1696-1702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The molecular species of endogenous cellular lipids were detected by UV monitoring at 206 nm and identified via comparison of elution times of authentic lipid standards. Radioactivity in the samples was measured using an online detector (β-RAM; Inus Systems, Tampa, FL). Analysis of OA and LA distribution into the neutral lipid pool was achieved via the use of TLC. Briefly, total lipids from SMCs incubated with 14C-labeled OA or LA were extracted as described above. Lipid extracts were applied to unmodified Silica Gel G TLC plates and developed in a solvent system of hexane:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (105:45:3) for ∼60 min. Plates were then dried and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for 24 h. Standards containing mono-, di-, and triglycerides (Nucheck Prep) were visualized by exposure of the plate to iodine vapor. An Amersham Biosciences Storm 860 PhosphorImager was used for detection and quantification of radioactive spots. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of a minimum of three experiments, performed in triplicate. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, using Graph Pad Prism (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Simultaneous multiple comparisons were based on post-hoc comparison tests using a Student- Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance was established at p< 0.05. IGF-I acts as a SMC growth factor and may play a role in lesion progression. We therefore determined levels of immunoreactive IGF-I in lesions from non-diabetic and diabetic pigs fed a cholesterol-rich diet. As shown in Fig.1 A, lesions from non-diabetic pigs fed a cholesterol-rich diet contained little IGF-I immunoreactivity. Lesions from diabetic pigs fed the same diet, on the other hand, were large and contained abundant IGF-I immunoreactivity that was localized mainly to the macrophage-rich region of the lesion (Fig. 1 B). A control antibody resulted in no staining of an adjacent section of the tissue (Fig. 1 C). Thus, lesions from diabetic pigs fed a cholesterol-rich diet contain more IGF-I immunoreactivity than lesions from non-diabetic animals. We evaluated the role of long-chained fatty acids common in triglycerides on basal and IGF-I-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in porcine SMCs. We used a concentration of IGF-I (1 nm) that results in maximal stimulation of thymidine incorporation (data not shown). OA and LA potentiated the effects of IGF-I (Fig.2 A), whereas thetrans isomer of OA, EA, and the positional isomer of LA, conjugated LA (Fig. 2 A), did not potentiate the effects of IGF-I. Furthermore, other long-chained fatty acids, such as AA, SA, and palmitate, did not enhance the effects of IGF-I. 2B. Askari and K. E. Bornfeldt, unpublished observations. However, SA and palmitate exhibited cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations (>70 μm). To study the time course of OA- and LA-induced effects on IGF-I-stimulated thymidine incorporation, SMCs were pre-incubated for 0–24 h with 70 μm OA or LA and then stimulated with IGF-I for an additional 18 h. OA and LA potentiated the effects of IGF-I in a time-dependent manner, with a maximal effect observed after a 24-h preincubation with LA and a 6-h preincubation with OA (Fig. 2, B and C,hatched bars). Because fatty acids require the esterification to a CoA moiety catalyzed by acyl-CoA synthases to achieve biological activity (12Færgeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), we determined the effects of preincubation of the CoA esters of OA and LA on IGF-I-induced increases in thymidine incorporation. Fig. 2 (B and C) demonstrates that the effects of OA and LA are increased with their esterification to CoA, as both OA-CoA and LA-CoA were more effective in potentiating the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, and a significant potentiation was seen earlier than that of unmodified OA and LA (Fig.2, B and C, cross-hatched bars). To confirm these results, we analyzed the effects of OA and LA on IGF-I-mediated increases in SMC number. OA and LA significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the effects of IGF-I after a 6-day stimulation (control: 54,970 ± 5,498 cells per well; LA, 61,830 ± 969 cells per well; OA, 68,843 ± 1,279 cells per well; IGF-I, 62,903 ± 786 cells per well; IGF-I + LA, 72,163 ± 3,307 cells per well; and IGF-I + OA, 81,270 ± 2,161 cells per well; mean ± S.E., n = 3). Thus, OA and LA enhance the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I in SMCs. We investigated the mechanism of action of OA- and LA-mediated enhancement of the IGF-I mitogenic effect. In some cell types, mitogenic effects of LA have been shown to be caused by the conversion of LA into its hydroxy metabolites, 9- and 13-HODEs, mostly via the action of the lipoxygenase pathway (13Rao G.N. Alexander R.W. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, our results show that LA-induced potentiation of the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I is independent of lipoxygenase activity, as pharmacological inhibition of either 5-lipoxygenase (L655238, 5 μm) or 12-lipoxygenase (baicalein, 25 μm) did not block the effect of LA (data not shown). It has also been demonstrated in other tissues that LA can serve as a substrate for cyclooxygenase (14Godessart N. Camacho M. Lopez-Belmonte J. Anton R. Garcia M. de Moragas J.M. Vila L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 726-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the porcine SMCs, inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1/cyclooxygenase-2 with indomethacin (10 μm) had no effect (data not shown). Furthermore, HPLC analysis of the media of SMCs labeled with [14C]LA and stimulated with IGF-I confirmed the pharmacological data, as there was neither release into the media nor any esterification of 9-/13-HODEs into membrane phospholipids (data not shown). There is also evidence that conversion of LA into HODEs may lead to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (15Willson T.M. Brown P.J Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the effects of OA and LA on IGF-I-stimulated SMC proliferation are mediated by PPARs because other fatty acid PPAR activators, such as AA and EA did not mimic the effects. We also observed that the PPARα agonist Wy-14643 did not mimic the effects of OA and LA (data not shown). These results indicate that HODEs do not mediate the actions of LA on IGF-I-stimulated SMC proliferation. Mitogenic signaling pathways induced by the IGF-I receptor in SMCs were next studied. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway has been reported as a main mitogenic pathway activated by IGF-I in SMCs (16Imai Y. Clemmons D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4228-4235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that was confirmed in our studies (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, neither OA nor LA consistently enhanced IGF-I-induced phosphorylation or expression of either protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) or p70S6K, which act downstream of PI3K, or p42/p44 ERK for up to 24 h. Furthermore, expression of the IGF-I receptor β-subunit was not increased by OA or LA (Fig. 3). In mammalian cells, long-chain fatty acids undergo β-oxidation for use as an energy source, or they enter different lipid pools. However, neither OA nor LA undergoes significant β-oxidation in SMCs, as incubation of [14C]OA and [14C]LA did not lead to a detectable increase in release of 14CO2 for up to 24 h (data not shown). We therefore investigated the degree of OA and LA incorporation into different lipid pools in SMCs, using TLC. As shown in Table I, the majority (∼90%) of OA and LA is incorporated into the phospholipid pool, with minor amounts in triglycerides, diglycerides, and monoglycerides. We next determined which phospholipid pools were the destination of LA and OA, by using HPLC. Fig. 4, Aand B, demonstrates that following exposure of SMCs to exogenous OA and LA, LA is found mainly in membrane phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) (Fig.4 A), whereas OA is distributed mainly into the PE, PS, and phosphatidylcholine (PC) pools (Fig. 4 B). These data demonstrate that the principal destination of OA and LA is the membrane phospholipid pools, which may serve as substrates for IGF-I-induced, phospholipase-dependent signaling pathways.Table IDistribution of OA and LA among membrane lipidsFAPLMG1,2DG1,3DGFFATGCEOA93 ± 1.30.03 ± 0.021.4 ± 0.40.12 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.44.5 ± 1.50.01 ± 0.01LA89 ± 3.10.02 ± 0.020.7 ± 0.30.07 ± 0.041.3 ± 0.68.6 ± 2.70.01 ± 0.01Porcine SMCs in 100-mm dishes were labeled with [14C]OA or [14C]LA (3 μCi/plate) for 24 h.

Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of % of total incorporation (n = 4). There are three groups of phospholipases that hydrolyze phospholipids, namely phospholipase C (PLC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and PLD. Becasue IGF-I may be able to activate all of these phospholipases, we investigated the contribution of PLC, PLA2, and PLD to OA and LA-induced potentiation of the mitogenic effect of IGF-I. Although IGF-I has previously been shown to activate PLC in SMCs (17Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the results show that pharmacological inhibition of PLC (U73312, 3 μm) did not affect fatty acid-induced potentiation of IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis, indicating that PLC activity is not required for this effect (data not shown). The fact that neither OA nor LA is incorporated into phosphatidylinositol (Fig. 4) supports the lack of PLC involvement in the mitogenic effects induced by these fatty acids. Inhibition of PLA2 with arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOF3, 10 μm) or ONO-RS-082 (10 μm) also did not affect OA- and LA-mediated potentiation (data not shown). Furthermore, cytosolic PLA2 cleaves fatty acids off the sn-2 position of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and is associated with the production of LA- and AA-derived hydroperoxy metabolites (18Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Our findings that OA and LA are not incorporated into phosphatidylinositol and that their effects are not mimicked by AA further support the lack of cytosolic PLA2 involvement, as does a previous study showing that IGF-I does not activate cytosolic PLA2 in SMCs (9Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Sidhu J.S. Argast G.M. Raines E.W. Ross R. Leslie C.C. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine the involvement of PLD, we used 1-butanol (an inhibitor of PLD action) and 2-butanol (inactive control). As shown in Fig.5 A, 1-butanol (0.2% v/v), but not 2-butanol (Fig. 5 B), completely blocked the potentiating effects of OA and LA. The role of the PLD pathway was also confirmed by using propranolol (a β-adrenergic blocker that also inhibits phosphotidate phosphohydrolase (PPH) activity). PPH catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid (PA) to DAG. Atenolol, another β-blocker without PPH-blocking activity, was used as a negative control. Propranolol (Fig. 5 C), but not atenolol (Fig.5 D), blocked OA- and LA-induced potentiation of the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I. These results indicate that PLD activation mediates the effects of OA and LA. Because PLD cleaves membrane PC and PE to form PA, which in turn is metabolized into DAG via the activity of PPH, we hypothesized that elevation of DAG levels should mimic the effects of OA and LA. Therefore, we inhibited DAG kinase (which phosphorylates DAG to PA and thus decreases levels of DAG) by using R59022. Indeed, inhibition of DAG kinase dose-dependently increased IGF-I-induced thymidine incorporation (Fig. 6), thus mimicking the effects of OA and LA. Together, these results show that the effects of OA and LA depend on PLD activity and subsequent generation of DAG.Figure 6Inhibition of DAG kinase increases the proliferative effects of IGF-I in porcine SMCs. Porcine SMCs were pretreated with R59022 at the indicated concentrations for 30 min prior to the addition of IGF-I (1 nm). DNA synthesis was measured as described in Fig. 2.

Interestingly, OA and LA have previously been demonstrated to enhance the effects of other growth factors in SMCs, such as angiotensin II (19Lu G. Meier K.E. Jaffa A.A. Rosenzweig S.A. Egan B.M.

Meier K.E. Rosenzweig S.A. Egan B.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 611-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the ability to enhance growth factor effects appears to be specific to OA and LA since SA, palmitate, AA, the trans isomer of OA, and the positional isomer of LA (EA and conjugated LA, respectively), do not mimic the effects of OA and LA. It has also been shown that micromolar concentrations of OA and LA can induce proliferation of SMCs in the absence of growth factors when added without prior coupling to a carrier protein (13Rao G.N. Alexander R.W. Runge M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 23Lu G. Morinelli T.A. Meier K.E. Rosenzweig S.A. Egan B.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 611-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although our results indicate that OA and LA appear to exert weak mitogenic effects by themselves when complexed to BSA, their main effect is to enhance the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I. Thus, unbound OA and LA may induce cellular responses quite different from those observed when OA and LA are complexed to a carrier protein at a physiological ratio (7Hamilton J.A. Kamp F. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2255-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We show that the effects of OA and LA on IGF-I-mediated SMC proliferation are likely to depend on entry of OA and LA into the cell and subsequent generation of CoA-esterified fatty acids, since OA-CoA and LA-CoA induced potentiation of the IGF-I response more efficiently and rapidly than OA and LA. Indeed, ∼90% of incorporated OA and LA were found in the membrane phospholipid pool. However, it is important to note that there was a dissimilar distribution of OA and LA into the membrane pools because OA was distributed mainly into membrane PC, PE, and PS, whereas LA was distributed mainly into PE and PS. To investigate how OA- and LA-containing phospholipids enhance the mitogenic effects of IGF-I, we studied a number of different possibilities. Our results show that OA and LA do not result in increased expression of the IGF-I receptor β-subunit nor do they enhance the ability of IGF-I to phosphorylate downstream kinases implicated in the mitogenic effects of IGF-I. Furthermore, the effects of OA and LA are unlikely to be caused by increased formation of reactive oxygen species, corroborating a recent finding that the contribution of OA to mitochondrial oxidation is minor (24Allen T.J. Hardin C.D. J. Vasc. Res. 2001; 38: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Accordingly, pretreatment with antioxidants had no effect on OA- or LA-induced potentiation of the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I. 3B. Askari and K. E. Bornfeldt, unpublished observations. Finally, under the conditions used in this study, neither activation of PPARs nor formation of HODEs appears to mediate the effects of OA and LA. Instead, our results show that the effects of OA and LA on IGF-I mitogenic action are mediated through a PLD-dependent mechanism. It has been shown, in SMCs as well as other cell types, that growth factors such as IGF-I can induce PLD activation (25Rydzewska G. Morisset J. Pancreas. 1995; 10: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and result in the hydrolysis of PC and, to some extent, PE. This hydrolysis leads to an increase in formation of PA, which is converted tosn-1, 2-DAG via the action of PPH (see Fig.7 and Ref. 26Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Inhibition of either PLD or PPH resulted in attenuation of the OA- and LA-mediated potentiation of the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I. Thus, it is likely that increased DAG formation, not PA, mediates the effects of OA and LA. Furthermore, the fact that inhibition of DAG kinase mimics the effects of OA and LA further supports that PLD-mediated generation of DAG is responsible for our observations (Fig. 7). Therefore, we propose that the incorporation of OA and LA into membrane PC and PE, in combination with IGF-I-stimulated PLD activity, leads to an increase in OA- and LA-containing species of DAG that may have a higher degree of activity than the “native” DAG. Indeed, it has been reported that changing the molecular species of the acyl chains of DAG (27Marignani P.A. Epand R.M. Sebaldt R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) can modulate the stimulation of protein kinase C activity, as measured in vitro. DAG has also been shown to activate other signaling molecules with potential mitogenic effects (28Wakelam M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that more DAG may be formed as a result of exposure of SMCs to OA and LA. Studies supporting this hypothesis have demonstrated that OA can inhibit platelet-derived growth factor–B-chain homodimer-induced increases in DAG kinase α activity in SMCs and that this attenuation of activity is associated with an increase in intracellular DAG concentrations (29Du X. Jiang Y. Qian W., Lu, X. Walsh J.P. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating these alternate pathways. We have previously shown, using the porcine model of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, that diabetes results in a marked increase in lesion progression and SMC accumulation and proliferation (3Suzuki L.A. Poot M. Gerrity R.G. Bornfeldt K.E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates a possible mechanism whereby elevated triglycerides and non-esterified fatty acids seen in diabetes may contribute to SMC proliferation and lesion progression. Accordingly, it has recently been shown that lipoprotein lipase (LPL), the main enzyme that hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids, is expressed by macrophages in lesions of atherosclerosis (30O'Brien K.D. Gordon D. Deeb S. Ferguson M. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of LPL can lead to an increase in the fatty acid content, preferentially OA, LA, and palmitic acid, in the arterial wall (31Esenabhalu V.E. Cerimagic M. Malli R. Osibow K. Levak-Frank S. Frieden M. Sattler W. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. Graier W.F. Br. J. Pharm. 2002; 135: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when macrophages are deficient in LPL, there is a decreased formation/progression of lesions of atherosclerosis (32Babaev V.R. Patel M.B. Semenkovich C.F. Fazio S. Linton M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26293-26299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Clee S.M. Bissada N. Miao F. Miao L. Marais A.D. Henderson H.E. Steures P. McManus J. McManus B.

Our preliminary results show that levels of immunoreactive LPL are markedly elevated in the macrophage-rich area in lesions from diabetic pigs compared with non-diabetic pigs. 4B. Askari, F. Kramer, and K. E. Bornfeldt, unpublished observations. Interestingly, high glucose levels and advanced glycation end products have been shown to increase LPL (35Sartippour M.R. Lambert A. Laframboise M., St- Jacques P. Renier G. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) expression in macrophages. In the present study, lesions from diabetic pigs were found to contain more IGF-I immunoreactivity than lesions from non-diabetic pigs. The IGF-I associated mainly with macrophage-rich areas of the lesions. We are currently investigating the possible mechanisms responsible for this increased IGF-I immunoreactivity. One possibility is that macrophages are the main source of IGF-I in the lesion and that lesions from diabetic pigs contain more macrophages than lesions from non-diabetic pigs. Other possibilities include a direct effect of factors associated with the diabetic environment on macrophage expression of IGF-I (36Kirstein M. Aston C. Hintz R. Vlassara H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or trapping of IGF-I derived from circulation, or other lesion cell types, in macrophage-rich areas. Whatever the source of IGF-I (endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine), the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I on SMCs are enhanced by OA and LA. Thus, we propose that diabetes results in increased levels of LPL and IGF-I in atheromas and that these events, in combination with the elevated levels of OA- and LA-containing triglycerides, accelerate SMC proliferation and lesion progression."

No effects were found in rat fat cells, whereas EGF (EC50 for glucose transport ∼0.02 nm) and transforming growth factor α (EC50 ∼0.2 nm), but not platelet-derived growth factor, mimicked the effects of insulin (EC50 ∼0.2 nm) on both pathways. EGF receptors, but not EGF, were abundantly expressed in human fat cells as well as in human skeletal muscle. EGF increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (the EGF receptor, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, and Grb2-associated binder 1), whereas Shc and Gab2 were only weakly and inconsistently phosphorylated. p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), was also found to associate with all of these docking molecules, showing that EGF activated PI 3-kinase pools that were additional to those of insulin. EGF and/or insulin increased protein kinase B/Akt serine phosphorylation to a similar extent, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation was more pronounced for EGF than for insulin. The impaired insulin-stimulated downstream signaling, measured as protein kinase B/Akt serine phosphorylation, in insulin-resistant cells (Type 2 diabetes) was improved by the addition of EGF. Thus, EGF receptors, but not EGF, are abundantly expressed in human fat cells and skeletal muscle. EGF mimics the effects of insulin on both the metabolic and mitogenic pathways but utilize in part different signaling pathways.

Binding of the ligand to the cognate growth receptors initiates a complex network of intracellular signals leading to cell growth, differentiation, and transformation (1Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 2Seedorf K. Metabolism. 1995; 44: 24-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, growth factors do usually not initiate the various metabolic effects seen with insulin, such as increased glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation (3Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence Jr., J.C. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26422-26427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following insulin binding, the insulin receptor undergoes autophosphorylation, and this event allows the propagation of signals by phosphorylation on tyrosine and, subsequently, on serine residues of several downstream signaling molecules. The insulin receptor substrates (IRSs), particularly IRS-1, are the main docking proteins in the insulin signaling pathway. They have several sites that, upon tyrosine phosphorylation, bind proteins with Src homology 2/3 (SH2/SH3) domains or adaptor proteins like the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, SHP2/Syp, Nck, and Grb-2 (4Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 5Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr.

These proteins then transmit the further downstream signals to elicit insulin's diverse actions on metabolism and cell growth. Similar to growth factors and independent of IRS phosphorylation, insulin activates the p21ras/MAP kinase pathway through the phosphorylation and activation of Shc (7Ricketts W.A. Rose D.W. Shoelson S. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated and activated EGF receptor (EGFR) can also recruit proteins with SH2/SH3 domains, but, in contrast to the insulin receptor, many of these proteins bind directly to the phosphorylated receptor. This leads to the activation of PI 3-kinase and tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic target proteins, which will then elicit the various biological effects of EGF. The activation of PI 3-kinase lipid kinase and the downstream serine/threonine kinase, PKB/Akt, by insulin is critical for the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and the increased glucose transport (4Myers Jr., M.G.

Similar to other growth factors, it has been shown that EGF and PDGF do not increase glucose transport in 3T3-L1 and rat adipocytes (3Robinson L.J. Razzack Z.F. Lawrence Jr., J.C. James D.E. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The inability of growth factors to activate glucose transport and metabolism has been attributed to the subcellular compartment where PI 3-kinase becomes activated. Growth factors, in general, activate PI 3-kinase by binding to the cognate receptors in the plasma membrane, whereas insulin uses the cytoplasmic IRS molecules, which can be targeted to the intracellular microsomal and GLUT4-containing compartment (4Myers Jr., M.G.

Gab1 and Gab2 have been shown to be important mediators of the signal transduction of growth factors and cytokines (18Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T.

Gab1 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by insulin, EGF, and other growth factors in A431 cells (20Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and can bind the p85 subunit and activate PI 3-kinase in response to EGF in different cell lines (20Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In contrast, in a recent study, Gab2 was found to be the major target for PI 3-kinase activation by EGF in rat hepatocytes (21Kong M. Mounier C., Wu, J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36035-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the metabolic effect of different growth factors in human and rat fat cells. We found that EGF, in contrast to other growth factors, exerted a full insulin-like effect in human, but not rat, fat cells. This species difference is due to the very abundant expression of EGFR in human, but not rat, adipocytes. We also compared the intracellular signaling pathways for insulin, EGF and TGF-α; the latter hormone is also a ligand for the EGFR. EGF/TGF-α increase the tyrosine phosphorylation and p85 binding to several intracellular docking proteins (IRS-1, IRS-2, Gab1, and EGFR), leading to the activation of both the metabolic and mitogenic pathways. Furthermore, by activating PI 3-kinase pools that are additional to those of insulin, EGF can also augment the downstream signaling of insulin in insulin-resistant states like Type 2 diabetes. Human insulin was from Novo Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). AG1478 and LY294002 were from Calbiochem, and bovine serum albumin (fraction V), collagenase, wortmannin, and other fine chemicals were from Sigma. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-IRS-1, anti-IRS-2, anti-PI 3-kinase, anti-Shc, anti-Gab1, and anti-Gab2 antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Protein A/G Plus-agarose and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies (Tyr(P)99) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibodies were from Promega (Madison, WI), and anti-phosphoserine (Ser473) PKB/Akt antibodies were from Biolab (Boston, MA). GLUT-4 antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. Samuel Cushman (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). Specimens of human subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained from the abdominal region of subjects undergoing elective surgery for nonmalignant diseases. In addition, needle biopsies of the adipose tissue from the same region were obtained from eight subjects with Type 2 diabetes. The biopsies were placed in Medium 199 Hanks at 37 °C containing 25 mmol/liter Hepes, 4% bovine serum albumin with 5.5 mmol/liter glucose. Skeletal muscle needle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis, placed in RNA Later (Ambion, Austin, TX), and snap-frozen in liquid N2 prior to RNA extraction. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Goteborg University. Adipose cells were prepared according to methods previously described (22Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Smith U. Sjostrom L. Bjorntorp P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 822-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue was cut into small fragments visibly free of connective tissue and clotted blood. About 0.6 g of tissue was incubated at 37 °C in Medium 199 Hanks containing 4% bovine serum albumin, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.8 mg/ml collagenase in a shaking water bath. After ∼50 min, isolated cells were filtered through a nylon mesh (pore size, 400 μm) and washed four times in fresh bovine serum albumin-containing medium before final resuspension at 2% cytocrit. Cell size and number were measured as previously described (23Smith U. Sjostrom L. Bjorntorp P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 822-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then incubated with the various additions as indicated. Subcellular fractions enriched in plasma membranes were isolated following homogenization and differential centrifugation as described previously (22Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Simpson I.A. Hedo J.A. Cushman S.W. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The membranes were resuspended in TES (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 msucrose) and assayed for proteins by the bicinchoninic acid method using a commercial kit (Pierce). Aliquots (30 μg of protein) were mixed with same volume of sample buffer, loaded on SDS-PAGE 10% and then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. Immunoblotting was performed as described below. Glucose transport activity was assayed for 1 h with 0.86 μm [U-14C]glucose as previously described. After 1 h, the cells were separated from the incubation medium by centrifugation through silicone oil, and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured by scintillation counting (22Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isolated human adipocytes were distributed into plastic vials (12–15% cell suspension) in a final incubation volume of 500 μl. Cells were preincubated with the indicated agents for 15 min, immediately separated by centrifugation through silicone oil and suspended in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm okadaic acid and rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with the different antibodies according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. Subsequently, the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A/G Plus-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer. Crude cell extracts or specific immunoprecipitations were boiled in Laemmli buffer containing 150 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6, 7.5, or 8%). Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets and blocked in 5% fat-free milk. The blots were probed with the different primary antibodies according to the recommendations of the manufacturers. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (AmershamBiosciences), and the intensity of the bands was quantitated with a laser densitometer (Amersham Biosciences). The PI 3-kinase assay was performed directly on IRS-1 or Gab1 immunoprecipitates as previously described (22Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the washings described above, 6 μl of a mixture of phosphatidylinositol (10 μg/sample) and phosphatidylserine (2.5 μg/sample) were added to the beads. The reaction was started by the addition of 30 μl of a reaction mixture consisting of 40 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mmol/liter MgCl2, 50 mmol/liter [32P]ATP (0.2 μCi/μl). After 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 μl of HCl (4 n) and 160 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase was extracted and applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate precoated with 1% potassium oxalate (Analtech, Newark, DE). The thin layer chromatography plates were developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. The radioactivity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Real time RT-PCR was used to examine the gene expression for EGF and TGF-α in fat cells and for EGFR in both fat cells and skeletal muscle from the same individuals. RNA was extracted, and mRNA levels for specific gene sequences were measured as previously reported in detail (25Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5013) Google Scholar, 26Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Nagaev I. Wenthzel A.M. Smith U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The sequences used for the primers and probes were as follows: EGF forward, 5′-TGTGTGCATGTATATTGAAGCATTG; EGF reverse, 5′-TGACATCGCTCCCCGATG; EGF probe, 5′-FAM-ACAAGTATGCATGCAACTGTGTTGTTGGC-TAMRA-3′; TGF-α forward, 5′-GCCAGCATGTGTCTGCCATT; TGF-α reverse, 5′-CACCACCAAGGCGGTGA; TGF-α probe, 5′-FAM-CTTCTTCTGGCTGGCAGCCACCAC-TAMRA-3′; EGFR forward, 5′-CCTGGGCAGCTGCCAA; EGFR reverse, 5′-GGCACAGATGATTTTGGTCAGTT; EGFR probe, 5′-FAM-CTTCTTCTGGCTGGCAGCCACCAC-TAMRA-3′. High concentrations of EGF/TGF-α, but not PDGF, increased glucose transport to the same extent as insulin, and no additive effect was seen when both EGF and insulin were present (Fig.1 A). Like insulin, glucose transport in response to EGF was inhibited by both wortmannin and ML-9, inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (27Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and PKB/Akt (8Smith U. Carvalho E. Mosialou E. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Rondinone C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore, the increased glucose transport induced by both hormones was associated with the translocation of GLUT4 from an intracellular microsomal compartment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 A). Although the rates of glucose transport and translocation from the microsomal fractions were the same, insulin tended to lead to a greater recovery of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane, a finding that was reproduced in three independent experiments. TGF-α, which also binds to EGFR (28Todaro G.J. Fryling C. De Larco J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5258-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 29Derynck R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 27-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), also increased glucose transport to the same extent as insulin and with a similar affinity (EC50 ∼0.2 nm) (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). In contrast, EC50 for EGF (∼0.02 nm) was considerably lower than for either insulin or TGF-α (Fig. 1 C). EGF also exerted a similar antilipolytic effect as insulin, and both effects were inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 1 D). Taken together, these findings show that EGF inhibits lipolysis and stimulates glucose transport to the same extent as insulin but with a considerably lower EC50. Furthermore, the effects of both hormones were inhibited by wortmannin as well as another inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown), suggesting that they were mediated through PI 3-kinase activation. As shown in Fig.2 A, EGF increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of major bands at ∼100 and 185–200 kDa, whereas the major insulin-stimulated phosphorylations were seen at ∼97 (insulin receptor) and 185 kDa (IRS). The EGF-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated ∼100-kDa band was identified as Gab1 by both co-localization (Fig. 2 A) and immunoprecipitation, which also precipitated activated EGFR (Fig. 2 B). Insulin did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 in human fat cells. Gab1 tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF was also clearly inhibited by wortmannin, suggesting that it was mediated through PI 3-kinase activation (Fig. 2 B, bottom). The 185–200-kDa bands phosphorylated by EGF were identified as both the EGFR and IRS-1 and IRS-2 (Fig. 2 C). The ability of EGF to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid and was seen within 2 min (data not shown). To further explore the possibility that the activated EGFR can bind to and phosphorylate IRS-1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. EGFR was recovered in IRS-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig.2 C), and, similarly, EGF increased the recovery of IRS-1 in EGFR immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Although EGF exerted insulin-like effects on glucose transport and lipolysis and increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, this was not due to activation of the insulin receptor, since EGF, in contrast to insulin, did not increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these findings show that both EGF and insulin increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2, while still showing specificity for their cognate receptors, and, in addition, EGF increases tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 through a wortmannin-inhibitable and, thus, presumably PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway. The ability of EGF, but not insulin, to phosphorylate and activate Gab1 is also consistent with the finding that Gab1 was translocated to the plasma membrane in response to EGF but not insulin (Fig.2 D). We also examined whether EGF increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2 or Shc. However, no clear and consistent effect on either of these proteins was found (data not shown). The ability of insulin and EGF to increase tyrosine phosphorylation in rodent fat cells, where EGF did not increase either glucose transport or inhibit lipolysis (data not shown) in agreement with previous findings (13Stagsted J. Ziebe S. Satoh S. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Olsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also examined. In contrast to human fat cells, neither Gab1 nor IRS-1 or IRS-2 were phosphorylated by EGF (Fig.2 E). The weak tyrosine- phosphorylated band at the size of EGFR suggests that rat fat cells have very few EGFR, as also previously reported (13Stagsted J. Ziebe S. Satoh S. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Olsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next examined whether the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR, IRS-1, and Gab1 in response to EGF. As shown in Fig. 3, EGF increased the association of p85 with all of these docking proteins without any additional effect by the presence of insulin, whereas insulin alone only increased the association with IRS-1. Similarly, both insulin and EGF increased the p85 binding to IRS-2 (data not shown). We also measured PI 3-kinase activity in response to EGF in IRS-1 and Gab1 immunoprecipitates. EGF increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 ∼100%, whereas the increase in Gab1-associated activity was more marked (4–500%) (data not shown). As a measure of downstream activation, we examined the ability of EGF and/or insulin to increase the threonine and serine phosphorylation of PKB/Akt. As shown in Fig. 4, both EGF and insulin increased the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt to a similar extent. In contrast, tyrosine/threonine phosphorylation of MAP kinase was more pronounced in the fat cells following incubation with EGF than with insulin (Fig. 4). The studies above show that EGF activates PI 3-kinase in pools (IRS-1, IRS-2, Gab1, and EGFR) that are additional to those of insulin (IRS-1/2). We then studied whether EGF can be used to augment insulin action in insulin-resistant states by characterizing the ability of insulin alone or in combination with EGF to increase the downstream insulin signaling, measured as serine phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, in fat cells from eight Type 2 diabetic subjects. As discussed above and shown in Fig. 4, EGF increases Ser(P)-PKB/Akt to a similar extent to insulin in normal (noninsulin-resistant) individuals, and no additive effects were found. However, insulin-stimulated Ser(P)-PKB/Akt is markedly reduced in cells from Type 2 diabetic subjects (30Rondinone C.M. Carvalho E. Wesslau C. Smith U.P. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 819-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 31Carvalho E. Eliasson B. Wesslau C. Smith U. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) where IRS-1 protein expression is reduced (32Rondinone C.M. Wang L.M. Lonnroth P. Wesslau C. Pierce J.H. Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS was reduced in diabetic cells, whereas the ability of EGF alone or in combination with insulin to increase the phosphorylation of Gab1 was normal. This is consistent with the finding that Gab1 protein expression was similar in control and diabetic cells (data not shown). The reduced EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR/IRS in diabetic cells (Fig. 5) is due to the reduced IRS-1 since EGFR expression was similar in both groups (data not shown). Consistent with the findings that EGF activates PI 3-kinase pools that are additional to those of insulin and that these are reduced in diabetic cells (32Rondinone C.M. Wang L.M. Lonnroth P. Wesslau C. Pierce J.H. Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we also found that the addition of EGF significantly increased downstream insulin signaling measured as Ser(P)-PKB/Akt, as compared with insulin alone in cells from Type 2 diabetic subjects (Fig.6). Since EGF mimicked insulin, both in terms of the metabolic effects and downstream signaling, we examined whether human fat cells express EGF and/or TGF-α mRNA, thus allowing for possible autocrine or paracrine regulation. However, using real time RT-PCR, we found no evidence for either EGF or TGF-α gene expression in human fat cells (TableI).Table ICt values (range) using real-time RT-PCR for EGF, TGF-α, and EGFR mRNA expressionFat cellsSkeletal muscleEGFNATGF-αNAEGFR27.7 (26–28)29.6 (28–30)cDNA equal to 5 ng of total RNA was used in the assay (n = 8). NA, not amplified (Ct values 38.4–50). The range of the Ct values for the gene of reference (18 S) was 18–21. Open table in a new tab cDNA equal to 5 ng of total RNA was used in the assay (n = 8). NA, not amplified (Ct values 38.4–50). The range of the Ct values for the gene of reference (18 S) was 18–21. In contrast, the EGF receptor was abundantly expressed in human fat cells as well as in skeletal muscle from the same individuals (TableI). In this paper, we show for the first time that the growth factors EGF/TGF-α, but not PDGF, exert full insulin-like effects in human fat cells and that EGF requires a much lower concentration than insulin to elicit these effects (EC50 ∼0.02 nm versus 0.2 nm). These findings, together with the high mRNA expression of EGFR, the marked receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by EGF as well as an abundant EGFR protein expression clearly document that EGF receptors are very highly expressed in human fat cells. This is markedly different from rat fat cells, which have a very low expression of EGF receptors as also previously reported (13Stagsted J. Ziebe S. Satoh S. Holman G.D. Cushman S.W. Olsson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1770-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference is probably the major reason for the finding that EGF does not exert any insulin-like effects in rat fat cells. In contrast, EGF receptors appear to be more abundantly expressed in mouse fat cells, including 3T3-L1 cells (33Reed B.C. Kaufmann S.H. Mackall J.C. Student A.K. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4876-4880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), where a partial insulin-like effect has been reported (34Conricode K.M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 835-843PubMed Google Scholar). In general, growth factors do not exert insulin-like effects despite the fact that they increase PI 3-kinase activity. This has been attributed to an inability to activate PI 3-kinase in appropriate subcellular compartments (16Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 35Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), to differential activation of PKB isoforms (9Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Okano J. Gaslightwala I. Birnbaum M.J. Rustgi A.K. Nakagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30934-30942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and/or to an increased serine and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (37Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, the present data clearly show that some growth factors, like EGF/TGF-α, can exert full insulin-like effects if the cognate receptors are abundantly expressed together with the downstream signaling molecules. The EGF receptor has three potential PTB-binding sites allowing for an interaction with substrates like IRS-1 (38Fujioka T. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and IRS-2. The present data clearly show that EGF increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same signaling molecules as seen with insulin and, in addition, Gab1 as well as its cognate receptor. Furthermore, both insulin and EGF increase the downstream phosphorylation and activation of PKB/Akt, which seems to play an important role for the insulin-stimulated glucose transport (8Smith U. Carvalho E. Mosialou E. Beguinot F. Formisano P. Rondinone C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Hill M.M. Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas EGF increased MAP kinase phosphorylation to a greater extent than insulin. The finding that the EGFR is also abundantly expressed in human skeletal muscle is consistent with our preliminary finding that EGF, similar to the results in fat cells, increases glucose transport in muscle to the same extent as insulin. 2H. Wallberg-Henriksson, S. Gogg, and U. Smith, unpublished observations. These findings raise the possibility that EGF, by virtue of its ability to activate a multitude of docking proteins for PI 3-kinase (IRS-1, IRS-2, Gab1, and EGFR), may improve the metabolic response in insulin-resistant states, including Type 2 diabetes, where PI 3-kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are markedly reduced in both fat cells (26Carvalho E. Jansson P.A. Nagaev I. Wenthzel A.M. Smith U. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1101-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,32Rondinone C.M. Wang L.M. Lonnroth P. Wesslau C. Pierce J.H. Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and skeletal muscle (39Zierath J.R. Krook A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 821-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our findings clearly support this possibility, since EGF was able to augment downstream insulin signaling in cells from Type 2 diabetic subjects. The binding specificity of the EGF family of ligands for the EGFR family members are classified into different groups (40Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). One group, which binds to EGFR homodimers, includes EGF and TGF-α, whereas the heregulins bind to Erbβ-3 and Erbβ4. The present findings that both EGF and TGF-α elicit the metabolic effects, combined with our finding that AG1478, a specific kinase inhibitor of EGFR, inhibited the effects of EGF (data not shown), clearly show that they were mediated through EGFR. The phosphorylation and activation of Gab1 by EGF in human fat cells is similar to what has been reported in other cells, although Gab2 has also recently been reported to be the major docking protein for PI 3-kinase activation in isolated rat hepatocytes (21Kong M. Mounier C., Wu, J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36035-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, both Gab2 and Shc were only slightly and inconsistently phosphorylated by EGF in human fat cells. Gab1, which belongs to the insulin receptor substrate-like family of adaptor molecules (20Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), is phosphorylated by several growth factors (including EGF, hepatocyte growth factor, nerve growth factor, and PDGF), cytokines (including IL-3 and IL-6, interferon α and β, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin), and T and B cell antigens (18Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Holgado-Madruga M.

Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 42Bouscary D. Lecoq-Lafon C. Chretien S. Zompi S. Fichelson S. Muller O. Porteu F. Dusanter-Fourt I. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Lacombe C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2197-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite this lack of specificity, Gab1 has been found to play a critical role for hepatocyte growth factor signaling, and Gab1-deficient mice display a phenotype that is similar to that seen in hepatocyte growth factor null mice (43Sachs M. Brohmann H. Zechner D. Muller T. Hulsken J. Walther I. Schaeper U. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1375-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Gab1 was a major tyrosine-phosphorylated band in response to EGF in human fat cells from both healthy and Type 2 diabetic subjects. Gab1 activation is associated with the recruitment of several SH2-containing signal transducers like SHPTP-2, PI 3-kinase, phospholipase C-γ, and Shc, factors generally linked to mitogenesis and cell growth. Whether Gab1 activation, in addition to IRS-1 and IRS-2 (4Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 615-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), also can play a role for the insulin-like effects of EGF (glucose transport and antilipolysis) remains to be established. However, the present data suggest that this is possible, since EGF-stimulated Gab1 phosphorylation was normal in diabetic cells and EGF also augmented the downstream insulin signaling (Ser(P)-PKB) in these cells. The finding that EGF elicits the phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 is in agreement with the recent work of Fujioka et al.in cultured rat hepatocytes as well as A431 cells abundantly expressing EGFR (38Fujioka T. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 44Fujioka T. Kim J.H. Adachi H. Saito K. Tsujimoto M. Yokoyama S. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4158-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These authors reported that EGFR directly phosphorylated IRS-1 in in vitro assays (44Fujioka T. Kim J.H. Adachi H. Saito K. Tsujimoto M. Yokoyama S. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4158-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and that this was markedly attenuated if the C-terminal of EGFR was truncated. The human EGFR contains three C-terminal NPXY sites, which could bind to the PTB domains of IRS-1, similar to the insulin receptor (45Zhou S. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 470-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The fact that the insulin-mimicking effects of EGF has not been reported before and that discrepant data have been reported in 3T3-L1 cells overexpressing EGFR (14Hardy R.W. Gupta K.B. McDonald J.M. Williford J. Wells A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Van Epps-Fung M. Hardy R.W. Williford J. Gupta K. Wells A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) is probably due to the different cell types studied as well as the rapid time of onset of EGF. Peak phosphorylation of IRS-1 is very rapid (within 2 min) and then declines (44Fujioka T. Kim J.H. Adachi H. Saito K. Tsujimoto M. Yokoyama S. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4158-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In human fat cells, where EGFR is highly abundant, we could confirm a rapid onset (<2 min), but the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 remained for at least 15 min. The tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 is probably due to kinase activity of EGFR and the binding to the PTB domains. We found no evidence for an indirect effect (i.e. interaction of JAK2 with IRS-1 following EGF), although JAK2 showed some degree of tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). An intriguing question, then, is why highly differentiated human fat cells maintain a highly abundant expression of EGFR that activate both the metabolic and growth-promoting pathways. Since human skeletal muscle also shows a high level of expression, a relevant question is whether EGF/EGFR can play a role in human pathophysiology or whether they are merely remnants from the growth and development of the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, EGF has been shown to markedly increase the growth and proliferation of primordial cells in the adipose tissue of rodents (46Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found EGF to markedly increase the growth of a human preadipocyte cell line. 3S. Gogg and U. Smith, unpublished observations. Thus, EGF/TGF-α may play an important role in early adipose tissue growth. We found no evidence that EGF or TGF-α are expressed in human fat cells or skeletal muscle excluding a local autocrine function. However, since EGFR have a high affinity for the ligands, circulating levels of EGF (around 60–180 pm) (47Hauner H. Rohrig K. Petruschke T. Eur J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) may play a role in glucose uptake and lipid mobilization in humans and may, for instance, explain why human subjects with mutations making the insulin receptors nonfunctional do not develop severe, ketotic diabetes like animal models devoid of insulin receptors (48Taylor S.I. Cama A. Accili D. Barbetti F. Quon M.J. de la Luz Sierra M. Suzuki Y. Koller E. Levy-Toledano R. Wertheimer E. Moncada V. Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 566-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 49Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Further studies aimed at clarifying the role of EGF in the adipose tissue are currently in progress. In conclusion, the present data show that growth factors like EGF/TGF-α are capable of mimicking the effects of insulin in human fat cells and that EGF receptors are abundantly expressed in both human skeletal muscle and fat cells. Furthermore, EGF activates several PI 3-kinase pools (IRS-1, IRS-2, Gab1, and EGFR) that are additional to those of insulin (IRS-1/2). This ability makes it possible for EGF to augment the effects of insulin in insulin-resistant states like Type 2 diabetes.

CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 31-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Rpb1, the largest RNAP II subunit, is extensively phosphorylatable on its carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), which consists of up to 52 repeats of the consensus heptapeptide Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser (2Dahmus M.E.

Two phosphoisoforms of RNAP II coexist in somatic cells in a dynamic equilibrium (3Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Bellier S. Bensaude O. J. Biol.

The conversion from IIA to IIO occurs during initiation and elongation of transcription and involves CTD kinases such as CDK7 and CDK9, respectively, included in the transcription factors TFIIH and p-TEFb (5Egly J.M.

FCP1 is a highly specific phosphatase as the CTD within a functional RNAP II remains its only known protein substrate. FCP1 is recruited to RNAP II through docking sites on the Rpb4 subunit of RNAP II and on the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF (15Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FCP1 activity is regulated at various levels. First, competitive binding of general transcription factors TFIIF and TFIIB to FCP1 carboxyl-terminal domain, respectively, stimulates or inhibits its phosphatase activity (15Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q.

Second, free RNAP IIO molecules are better substrates than molecules engaged in transcription elongation complexes (18Lehman A.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol.

Third, inhibition of FCP1 phosphatase activity by the human immunodeficiency viral protein Tat may contribute to stimulate transcriptional elongation from the human immunodeficiency virus promoter (20Marshall N.F.

AIDS. 2001; 15: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We had characterized previously (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) the Xenopus laevis FCP1 orthologue, xFCP1. We now report that, in Xenopus somatic cells and eggs, xFCP1 is phosphorylated. The major kinase involved in this process is identified as casein kinase 2 (CK2), a pleiotropic kinase involved in various cellular processes including cell proliferation and gene expression (23Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). CK2 phosphorylation strongly enhances FCP1 binding to TFIIF and CTD phosphatase activity. These findings unravel a new mechanism potentially regulating CTD dephosphorylation. A6 cells derived fromXenopus kidney were propagated as described previously (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 24 h after plating, subconfluent cells were lysed in PB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2.8 units per μl of calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was stopped by addition of the same volume of Laemmli sample buffer. Interphasic egg extracts were prepared according to Murray (24Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) with modifications described previously (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To identify the CK2 phosphorylation sites, the xFCP1-coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pGEX4T2-xFCP1wt (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and inserted in-frame with an amino-terminal histidine tag in pET19b vector (Novagen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange protocol (Stratagene). Insertion of the desired point mutations was checked by sequencing. X. laevis RAP74 (xRAP74) was cloned by taking advantage of a pre-exisiting sequence in GenBankTM data base (accession number Z17426). Total RNAs were extracted from A6 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The primers ATA TGC ACA TAT GGC ATC GCT GGG CAC CAG and ATG GAT CCT CAC TCC TTA AGG TAA AAG TGC ATC TTG TC were used to amplify the full-length xRAP74 open reading frame by reverse transcription-PCR (Thermoscript RT; Invitrogen). The 1,593-bp PCR product was sequenced and aBamHI/NdeI restriction fragment was subcloned in pET19b providing plasmid pET19-xRAP74. The insert was sequenced and differed slightly from the preexisting one and was therefore submitted to GenBankTM under accession number AY114105. For protein expression,Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon+ cells (Stratagene) were transformed with the appropriate plasmids, and an exponentially growing culture was induced for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. xFCP1 fused to GST was purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For His-tagged proteins production, bacterial cells were harvested, resuspended in 1:20 culture volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and sonicated. The resulting lysate was supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was bound onto Ni2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Bound fusion proteins were recovered with Elution Buffer (20 mm Na2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT. Samples in Laemmli buffer were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading on SDS-PAGE. Western blots were carried out using as primary antibodies: anti-human FCP1 (kindly provided by Dr. Jack Greenblatt), anti-human RAP74 (kindly provided by Dr. Zachary Burton), and anti-CK2α (Calbiochem). Reactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) and chemiluminescence (Pierce). For RAP74 Far Western blots, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Blocking buffer (5% (w/v) skim milk, 20 mmTris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 2 mmDTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and hybridized for 4 h at room temperature with Blocking buffer supplemented with 1 μm recombinant Xenopus RAP74. After extensive washing, membranes were processed as for Western blots using anti-RAP74 as primary antibody. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in PB buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of anti-FCP1 or mock serum. The beads were washed with PB buffer and incubated with 10 μl of crude interphasic Xenopus egg extract previously radiolabeled for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol). After 30 min of shaking at 4 °C, the beads were washed 3 times with PB buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Interphasic extracts (0.3 ml) from freshly laid eggs were diluted 10-fold in CB (Chromatography buffer, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT), filtered through a 0.2-μ Millipore membrane and immediately applied to an HR5/5 MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a 20-ml linear NaCl gradient (20–500 mm) in CB buffer followed by a 10-ml linear NaCl gradient (500–1,000 mm) in CB buffer. 1-ml fractions were collected, supplemented with glycerol (10% final), and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots (5 μl) of column input or fractions from the MonoQ column were added to 10 μl of GP buffer (20 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaVO3, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), and the appropriate substrate as follows: full-length recombinant xFCP1 (1 μg) or casein (Sigma) (2 μg). When indicated, the reaction contained 20 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) or 100 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The phosphorylation was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 30 °C and was stopped by addition of 15 μl of 2× Laemmli. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantification of kinase activity was performed using a FujiBAS 3000 Imager. Alternatively, 5 μl of crude interphasic egg extract was incubated for increasing times at 30 °C in the presence of recombinant Xenopus FCP1 (1 μg) and 1 mm ATP in a total volume of 15 μl of GP buffer. Reaction was arrested as above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by anti-FCP1 Western blot. Recombinant FCP1 was phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 as follows: 1 μg of FCP1 was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mmol), and 20 microunits of recombinant casein kinase 2 (reconstituted holoenzyme α2β2, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), in a total volume of 15 μl of GP buffer. For extensive phosphorylation, cold ATP only was used at a 5 mm concentration. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST-xFCP1 fusion proteins were incubated with 7.5 milliunits per ml of purified CK2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in GP buffer in the presence of 5 mm ATP for 40 min at 30 °C under agitation. The beads were next washed three times with PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, and the fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The GST moiety was removed from the eluted fusion protein by digestion with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) per mg of protein for 30 min at room temperature. Thrombin was next neutralized by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Alternatively, for GST pull-down, the beads were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. 1 nm of recombinant xRAP74 was then added, and incubation was followed for 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS, beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and SDS-PAGE analysis was performed. Purified calf thymus RNAP IIA was labeled in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and converted to RNAP IIO as described previously (25Dubois M.-F. Marshall N.F. Nguyen V.T. Dahmus G.K. Bonnet F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1338-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled RNAP IIO (1000–5000 cpm, 50 fmol) was incubated with recombinant xFCP1 at 30 °C in PB buffer (20 μl final volume) in the presence of 2 pmol of recombinant xRAP74. Reactions were stopped by addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 10 mm KOAc, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7,9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0,1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0,5 mm DTT, 10 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) and xFCP1 as indicated were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Reaction was arrested by the addition of 50 μl of 1m sodium carbonate. Production of p-nitrophenol was determined by measuring absorbance at 410 nm. To investigate post-translational modifications, electrophoretic mobilities of endogenous and recombinant xFCP1 proteins were compared. Endogenous FCP1 present in Xenopus A6 cells was totally extracted in a low salt buffer (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and migrated as a protein doublet, slower than the recombinant protein, as revealed by Western blot (Fig.1 A, middle andleft lanes). To test if such a slower migration was due to phosphorylation, the cell extract was treated with alkaline phosphatase before SDS-PAGE. After such a treatment, xFCP1 migrated as fast as the recombinant protein (right lane). Thus, FCP1 is phosphorylated in A6 cells, and phosphorylation is sufficient to account for the difference in electrophoretic properties between cellular and recombinant proteins. FCP1 phosphorylation was investigated in Xenopus egg extract, a system that supports elaborate cellular functions (24Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP was added to an interphasic egg extract, and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-FCP1 antibody. Autoradiography revealed a unique 32P-labeled band that comigrated with xFCP1 (Fig. 1 B). This band was present in anti-FCP1 but not in mock immunoprecipitates. Therefore, xFCP1 is phosphorylated in Xenopus egg extracts as well as in somatic cells. The latter experiment suggested that an FCP1 kinase(s) is(are) present in egg extracts. To assay FCP1 kinase activity, recombinant FCP1 was incubated with egg extracts for increasing times. An ATP-dependent decrease in FCP1 electrophoretic mobility was observed by Western blot (Fig.2 A). After 1 h of incubation, the migration of recombinant FCP1 became identical to that of cellular FCP1. Hence egg extracts contain kinase(s) that may account for FCP1 phosphorylation. To identify this(these) kinase(s), an egg extract was fractionated on a MonoQ anion exchange column, and fractions were assayed for FCP1 kinase activity. A radioactive band at the expected migration was visualized when fractions 18–20 were incubated with recombinant FCP1 and [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 2 B), but not when the protein substrate was omitted (data not shown). This activity peaked in fraction 19 (corresponding to a 460 mm NaCl elution). Thus, a single FCP1 kinase activity fractionated from egg extracts. Previous experiments from our laboratory had indicated that CK2 eluted from a MonoQ column with NaCl concentrations close to 450 mm (data not shown). We therefore investigated whether FCP1 kinase activity could be attributable to CK2. Aliquots of the MonoQ column were incubated with casein and [γ-32P]ATP. A casein kinase activity also peaked in fraction 19 (Fig.3 A, top). An antibody directed against human CK2α subunit detected a protein with the appropriate size (42 kDa) only in fraction 19 (Fig. 3 A,bottom). Furthermore, the elution profiles for both CK2 and FCP1 kinase activities matched perfectly (Fig. 3 B). CK2 activity is well established to be strongly inhibited by heparin but enhanced by polyamines (26Glover C.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Indeed, the FCP1 kinase in fraction 19 was completely inhibited by heparin (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, polylysine increased the FCP1 kinase activity (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, these experiments suggest that CK2 is the dominant FCP1 kinase in Xenopus egg extracts. The properties of recombinant xFCP1 phosphorylated by purified CK2 were investigated next. Phosphorylation by CK2 decreased xFCP1 electrophoretic mobility as revealed by Western blot (Fig.4 A, left panel). This change was due to phosphate incorporation as checked by autoradiography (Fig. 4 A, right panel). CK2 phosphorylates mainly serine residues in an acidic context, within the consensus motif S(D/E)X(D/E) (27Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercron J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Trott R.L. Kalive M. Paroush Z. Bidwai A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several such potential CK2 phosphorylation sites are found in the xFCP1 protein sequence. Three serine clusters were conserved from frogs to humans as follows: three potential serine targets were present in cluster A, centered on Ser457, in the middle of the protein, in cluster B, centered on Ser886, at the carboxyl terminus, but cluster C, centered on Ser963 at the extreme carboxyl terminus, only showed a single serine target (Fig. 4 B). It should be noted that phosphorylation of one serine may prime phosphorylation of other neighboring serines by introducing an acidic context (29Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize the phosphorylation sites, mutant His-tagged xFCP1 proteins were elaborated; in each mutant the potential CK2 serine targets within one cluster were replaced by alanines (Fig. 4 B). Wild-type and mutant xFCP1 proteins were submitted to extensive CK2 phosphorylation followed by Western blot. The phosphorylation-induced shift of cluster B or cluster C mutant proteins was similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, mutation of cluster A markedly decreased the shift. A similar decrease was observed when cluster A mutation was combined with mutations in clusters B or C. These results suggest that the major CK2 phosphorylation site in xFCP1 is localized within cluster A, centered on Ser457. To investigate the effect of CK2 phosphorylation on the CTD phosphatase activity, recombinant GST-xFCP1 was phosphorylated or not by CK2 on glutathione beads and eluted by reduced glutathione. CTD phosphatase activity was detected using 32P-labeled mammalian RNAP IIO and by taking advantage of the faster electrophoretic migration of the dephosphorylated Rpb1 subunit (22Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNAP IIO dephosphorylation time courses were performed in the presence of an excess of recombinant xRAP74 subunit of TFIIF (Fig.5 A). The amount in the dephosphorylated Rpb1 form, IIa, was quantified and plotted against the reaction time, demonstrating that CTD dephosphorylation followed a linear dependence with time (Fig. 5 B). Most importantly, the CK2-phosphorylated xFCP1 was 4 times more active than control xFCP1. RAP74 is known to stimulate FCP1 activity (15Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indeed, addition of xRAP74 markedly increased the CTD phosphatase activity, and a half-activation was observed with 10 ± 2 nm of RAP74. Phosphorylation of FCP1 did not appear to significantly modify the xRAP74 concentration dependence (Fig. 5 C). The CTD phosphatase activity of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated xFCP1 reached a plateau when the RAP74 concentration exceeded 20 nm. Thus, CK2 phosphorylation of FCP1 significantly increases the CTD phosphatase catalytic rate. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate has been used as an artificial substrate for Saccharomyces cerevisiae orSchizosaccharomyces pombe FCP1 (14Kobor M.S. Archambault J. Lester W. Holstege F.C. Gileadi O. Jansma D.B. Jennings E.G. Kouyoumdjian F. Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 30Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed,p-nitrophenol was generated in proportion to the amounts of FCP1 in the assay (Fig. 5 D). However, CK2 phosphorylation of FCP1 did not significantly influence thep-nitrophenylphosphatase activity. Hence, the CK2 phosphorylation effect on FCP1 activity is specific for RNA polymerase II used as a substrate. We next questioned the involvement of cluster A phosphorylation in the increase in CTD phosphatase activity. Wild-type or mutant His-tagged xFCP1 proteins were phosphorylated or not by CK2 and repurified by Ni2+ chromatography. The amounts of the four proteins were adjusted to provide a similar signal with in-gel Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). CTD phosphatase activity was precisely measured for each protein in linear dephosphorylation conditions. Phosphorylation by CK2 strongly activated the wild-type protein but failed to significantly activate the mutant A (Fig. 5 E). Hence CK2 phosphorylation of serines in cluster A accounts for the enhanced FCP1 CTD phosphatase activity. Genuine FCP1 is known to bind strongly to the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF, and this interaction stimulates phosphatase activity (10Archambault J. Chambers R. Kobor M.S., Ho, Y. Cartier M. Bolotin D. Andrews B. Kane C. Greenblatt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14300-14305Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Chambers R.S. Wang B.Q. Burton Z.F. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14962-14969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Kimura M. Suzuki H. Ishihama A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To investigate a possible modulation of FCP1 binding to TFIIF by phosphorylation, a Far Western blot was performed using recombinant xRAP74 as a probe. The anti-RAP74 antibody did not react with xFCP1 phosphorylated or not (data not shown). RAP74 bound stronger on phosphorylated xFCP1 (xFCP1-P) than on control although equal amounts of proteins had been loaded (Fig.6 A). To investigate RAP74-FCP1 interaction in non-denaturing conditions, GST pull-down experiments were performed. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST or GST-FCP1 previously phosphorylated or not by CK2 were incubated with recombinant RAP74. The amounts of GST, GST-xFCP1, and GST-xFCP1-P were checked to be identical by Coomassie Blue staining. In these conditions, phosphorylated FCP1 bound to RAP74 with a much stronger efficiency than control FCP1 (Fig. 6 B). There was no discrepancy between this result and the kinetic data that were obtained using much higher concentrations of RAP74 not discriminating between FCP1 and FCP1-P anymore (Fig. 5 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that phosphorylation of FCP1 by CK2 strongly enhances its binding to RAP74. Here we report that in X. laevis cells, the RNAP II CTD phosphatase FCP1 is a phosphoprotein. CK2 appears to be the in vivo FCP1 kinase: (i) CK2 cofractionates with the major FCP1 kinase activity eluting from a MonoQ column; (ii) FCP1 kinase activity and CK2 exhibit the same pattern of drug sensitivity; and (iii) purified CK2 is an efficient FCP1 kinase in vitro. Phosphorylation of recombinant FCP1 by CK2 enhances CTD phosphatase activity and binding to TFIIF. CK2 is a nuclear enzyme conserved in eucaryotes and exhibits pleiotropic functions; among them, it is required for cell cycle progression in yeast (26Glover C.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and can function as an oncogene in mammals (31Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). RNAP II CTD phosphorylation appears as a highly regulated process essential for gene expression (2Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 4Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 32Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 33Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of the enzymes involved in establishing the CTD phosphorylation profile is therefore critical. Phosphorylation of CTD kinases and/or their associated cyclins regulates global or specific gene transcription. For example, phosphorylation of CDK7 accounts for the inhibition of this TFIIH-associated kinase and thereby transcription during mitosis (34Akoulitchev S. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3541-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of cyclin H by CDK8 negatively regulates CDK7 (35Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of CDK9 might contribute to the positive control of human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat-driven transcription (36Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5897-5907Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We now show that phosphorylation of FCP1 by CK2 enhances its CTD phosphatase activity. Substrate recognition by FCP1 is indirect; although it dephosphorylates the CTD of Rpb1, its docking sites are located on distinct polypeptides, the Rpb4 subunit of RNA polymerase II and the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF (16Kimura M. Suzuki H. Ishihama A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1577-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As FCP1 phosphorylation does not affect its p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity, it might contribute to an adequate positioning of the CTD rather than modifying the catalytic site. In vivo, the enhanced binding of phosphorylated FCP1 to RAP74 may increase the influence of phosphorylation on the phosphatase activity. CK2 activity is poorly regulated in vivo, and it has been suggested that dephosphorylation of CK2 substrates might be the regulatory step (37Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). Although FCP1 is itself a phosphatase, it did not exhibit autodephosphorylation in our hands (data not shown). Interestingly, in S. cerevisiae, FCP1 has been reported to interact with a PP2C-related phosphatase (open reading frame number YCR079W) in a two-hybrid screen (38Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (2946) Google Scholar). FCP1 dephosphorylation might therefore regulate the CTD dephosphorylation process. Most relevant to our findings, CK2 seems involved in transcription by the three classes of eucaryotic RNA polymerases. CK2 is clearly required for class III gene expression in yeast as well as in human cells (39Ghavidel A. Schultz M.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 575-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,40Johnston I.M. Allison S.J. Morton J.P. Schramm L. Scott P.H. White R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3757-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CK2 forms a stable complex with TFIIIB, and phosphorylates its TATA-binding subunit. CK2 phosphorylation might be required for TFIIIB to be recruited on most but not all class III promoters. The CK2 inhibition that follows a genotoxic stress might therefore contribute to shut-off class III gene transcription. CK2 has also been suggested to be involved in class I gene expression as a component of the RNA polymerase I holoenzyme and as a kinase phosphorylating the upstream binding factor (UBF) (41Voit R.

Moreover, immunofluorescence studies on polytene chromosomes have indicated that the CK2α catalytic subunit is colocalized with transcribing RNAP II (47Egyhazi E. Ossoinak A. Filhol-Cochet O.

https://openalex.org/W2057160549,"Abstract The prokaryotic post-termination ribosomal complex is disassembled by ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and elongation factor G. Because of the structural similarity of RRF and tRNA, we compared the biochemical characteristics of RRF binding to ribosomes with that of tRNA. Unesterified tRNA inhibited the disassembly of the post-termination complex in a competitive manner with RRF, suggesting that RRF binds to the A-site. Approximately one molecule of ribosome-bound RRF was detected after isolation of the RRF-ribosome complex. RRF and unesterified tRNA similarly inhibited the binding of N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA to the P-site of non-programmed but not programmed ribosomes. Under the conditions in which unesterified tRNA binds to both the P- and E-sites of non-programmed ribosomes, RRF inhibited 50% of the tRNA binding, suggesting that RRF does not bind to the E-site. The results are consistent with the notion that a single RRF binds to the A- and P-sites in a somewhat analogous manner to the A/P-site bound peptidyl tRNA. The binding of RRF and tRNA to ribosomes was influenced by Mg2+ and NH ions in a similar manner."

Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) represent a significant fraction of this epithelium and play an important role in intestinal mucosal barrier function. We have generated a germ-free transgenic mouse model to examine the effects of a genetically engineered proliferative abnormality in the principal epithelial cell lineage (enterocytes) on IEL census and on IEL-enterocytic cross-talk. SV40 large T antigen (TAgWt) or a mutant derivative (TAgK107/8) that does not bind pRB was expressed in small intestinal villus enterocytes under the control of elements from the intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabpi). Quantitative immunohistochemical and flow cytometric analyses of conventionally raised and germ-free FVB/NFabpi-TAgWt,Fabpi-TAgK107/8, and nontransgenic mice disclosed that forced reentry of enterocytes into the cell cycle is accompanied by an influx of thymically educated αβ T cell receptor (TCR)+ CD4+ and αβ TCR+CD8αβ+ IELs and a decrease in intestinally derived γδ TCR+ CD8αα IELs. Real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR studies of jejunal villus epithelium recovered from germ-free transgenic and normal mice by laser capture microdissection and γδ TCR+ jejunal IELs purified by flow cytometry disclosed that the proliferative abnormality is accompanied by decreased expression of enterocytic interleukin-7 as well as IEL interleukin-7Rα and transforming growth factor β3. The analysis also revealed that normal villus epithelium expresses Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3), a known regulator of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and neuronal cell survival, and its ligand (Flt3L). Epithelial expression of this receptor and its ligand is reduced by the proliferative abnormality, whereas IEL expression of Flt3L remains constant. Together, these findings demonstrate that changes in the proliferative status of the intestinal epithelium affects maturation of γδ TCR+ IELs and produces an influx of αβ TCR+ IELs even in the absence of a microflora.

This regional variation in function is accompanied by regional differences in the differentiation programs of its four continuously renewing epithelial cell lineages, in the composition of its mucosal immune system, and in the composition of its resident society of commensal/symbiotic microorganisms (reviewed in Refs. 1Falk P.G. Hooper L.V. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hooper L.V. Gordon J.I.

A full understanding of how this ecosystem is organized and functions in health and how it is reorganized or disorganized in various disease states requires knowledge about the nature and regulation of interactions between its microflora, epithelium, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (1Falk P.G. Hooper L.V. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gordon J.I. Hooper L.V. McNevin M.S. Wong M. Bry L. Am. J.

The molecular nature and significance of the signals exchanged between these components have been difficult to decipher because of the dynamic quality and complexity of the system. One way of approaching this problem is to simplify the ecosystem using inbred strains of mice with defined microbiological status (gnotobiotic animals). For example, comparative functional genomics studies of mice containing no resident microorganisms (germ-free), conventionally raised mice harboring an complete microflora, and germ-free animals that have been colonized with a single species from the normal microflora (ex-germ-free) have shown that indigenous commensal bacteria play an important role in regulating host nutrient processing, fortifying the epithelial barrier, and organizing/educating the mucosal immune system (5Hooper L.V.

Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. Methods in Microbiology: Molecular Cellular Microbiology. Academic Press, London2002: 559-589Google Scholar). The intestine contains a large population of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs),1equivalent in size to the population of peripheral lymphocytes that resides in the spleen (7Kaufmann S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2272-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). IELs are distributed throughout the epithelium that overlies small intestinal villi (average of one IEL for every 6–10 epithelial cells (8Beagley K.W. Husband A.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 237-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Virtually all small intestinal IELs are T cells, but they are heterogeneous with respect to their surface phenotype. The majority are CD3+ and can be divided into αβ T cell receptor-positive (TCR+) and γδ TCR+ subsets (8Beagley K.W. Husband A.J. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 237-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They can be further subdivided based on expression of CD8 (αα homodimer or αβ heterodimer) or CD4 coreceptors (i.e. (i) γδ TCR+CD8α− CD8β−; (ii) γδ TCR+CD8α+ CD8β− (abbreviated γδ+ TCR+ CD8αα); (iii) αβ TCR+ CD4+; (iv) αβ TCR+CD8α+ CD8β− (αβ TCR+CD8αα); and (v) αβTCR+ CD8α+CD8β+ (αβTCR+ CD8αβ)). Studies of Rag1 −/− mice injected with bone marrow from nude mice or peripheral lymph node T cells from euthymic mice demonstrated that generation of αβ TCR+CD4+ and CD8+ IELs is thymus-dependent, whereas γδ TCR+CD8αα+ IELs appeared in the absence of a thymus (9Rocha B. Vassalli P. Guy-Grand D. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). One site of extrathymic maturation may be the crypts of Lieberkuhn. These distinct mucosal invaginations surround the base of each villus and contain long-lived multipotent stem cells (10Wong M.H. Saam J.R. Stappenbeck T.S. Rexer C.H. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12601-12606Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that give rise to the four epithelial lineages of the small intestine: enterocytes, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells, which differentiate as they migrate from the crypt up adjacent villi; and Paneth cells, which differentiate and remain at the crypt base (11Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 537-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar, 12Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J.

Crypts possess structures (cryptopatches) that contain clusters of c-Kit+interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R)+ Thy1+lymphocytes (16Kanamori Y. Ishimaru K. Nanno M. Maki K. Ikuta K. Nariuchi H. Ishikawa H. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Mice with a truncated mutation of the common cytokine receptor chain (17Ohbo K. Asao H. Kouro T. Nakamura M. Takaki S.

The epithelium also appears to play a direct role in regulating IEL development. Epithelial cells produce stem cell factor (21Godfrey D.I. Zlotnik A. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2281-2285PubMed Google Scholar), a ligand for the c-Kit receptor expressed on the surface of γδ TCR+ IELs (22Puddington L. Olson S. Lefrancois L. Immunity. 1994; 1: 733-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in either stem cell factor or c-Kit have reduced numbers of γδ TCR+ IELs (22Puddington L. Olson S. Lefrancois L. Immunity. 1994; 1: 733-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation of enterocytes results in local release of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which interacts with IEL-based thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor to promote IEL development (23Wang J. Whetsell M. Klein J.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1937-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (e.g. hyt/hyt mice, which have a loss-of-function thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor mutation, have disrupted IEL maturation) (24Stein S.A.

Taylor N.A. Puett D. Jin S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Epithelium-based IL-7 provides another regulatory signal for IEL proliferation (26Fujihashi K. McGhee J.R. Yamamoto M. Peschon J.J. Kiyono H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Studies of mice that lack IL-7 or the IL-7R have demonstrated that IL-7R-mediated signaling is essential for γδ TCR+ IEL development (26Fujihashi K. McGhee J.R. Yamamoto M. Peschon J.J. Kiyono H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2133-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 27Maki K. Sunaga S. Komagata Y. Kodaira Y. Mabuchi A. Karasuyama H. Yokomuro K. Miyazaki J.I. Ikuta K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7172-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Moreover, Laky et al. (28Laky K. Lefrancois L. Lingenheld E.G. Ishikawa H. Lewis J.M. Olson S. Suzuki K. Tigelaar R.E. Puddington L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) used transcriptional regulatory elements from the rat intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (Fabpi) to express IL-7 in the villus enterocytes of Il-7−/−mice. γδ TCR+ IELs were restored in the intestinal epithelium but remained absent from all other tissues, indicating that local production of IL-7 was sufficient for proper development/survival of this IEL subset. Interactions between intestinal epithelial cells and IELs are reciprocal; IELs can influence epithelial cell biology. One illustration of this reciprocity is provided by TCRδ subunit-deficient mice. These animals have reduced numbers of dividing cells in their crypts of Lieberkuhn and reduced crypt cellularity (29Komano H. Fujiura Y. Kawaguchi M. Matsumoto S. Hashimoto Y. Obana S. Mombaerts P.

Smith A.L. West A.B. Wen L. Findly R.C. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11774-11779Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). γδ TCR+ IELs produce keratinocyte growth factor, which affects epithelial cell growth and repair (31Boismenu R. Havran W.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1253-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). These findings raise the question of whether γδ TCR+ IELs form part of a homeostatic surveillance mechanism that can detect and respond to perturbations in intestinal epithelial proliferation in order to maintain steady state cellular census in crypts and their associated villi. Some workers have proposed that IELs are key elements in a “mucosal intranet,” where they function to control epithelial integrity and immunologic homeostasis (32Yamamoto M. Fujihashi K. Kawabata K. McGhee J.R. Kiyono H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2188-2196PubMed Google Scholar). Recent comparative DNA microarray-based studies of gene expression in γδ TCR+ IELs harvested from the small intestines of conventionally raised adult C57Bl6/J mice and αβ TCR+ cells harvested from their mesenteric lymph nodes have provided a list of candidate factors, preferentially expressed by γδ TCR+ IELs, that may support this mucosal intranet (33Fahrer A.M. Konigshofer Y. Kerr E.M. Ghandour G. Mack D.H. Davis M.M. Chien Y.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 34Shires J. Theodoridis E.

In the present study, we examine the cross-talk between IELs and epithelium using transgenic mice that express simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAgWt) in their villus-associated enterocytes. The rationale for our experimental approach was as follows.Fabpi-directed expression of TAgWt produces a proliferative abnormality restricted to villus enterocytes:Fabpi-reporter transgenes are not expressed in the IELs. Expression of the viral oncoprotein in postmitotic enterocytes induces their reentry into the cell cycle (35Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28414-28421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and an associated p53-independent apoptosis (36Coopersmith C.M. Chandrasekaran C. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but is not accompanied by evidence of dysplasia during the 1–2-day interval that they take to complete their migration to the cellular extrusion zone located at the villus tip (36Coopersmith C.M. Chandrasekaran C. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,37Falk P. Roth K.A. Gordon J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: G987-G1003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fabpi-directed expression of a mutant TAg containing a Glu → Lys substitution at residues 107 and 108 (TAgK107/8) disrupts pRB binding that does not produce this proliferative abnormality. Thus, a three-way comparison of FVB/NFabpi-TAgWt andFabpi-TAgK107/8 transgenic mice and their age-matched nontransgenic littermates would allow direct assessment of whether a proliferative abnormality limited to the predominant intestinal epithelial lineage is accompanied by changes in the fractional representation of extrathymically educated or thymically derived IEL subsets. By performing this analysis in conventionally raised and germ-free mice, we could also determine whether the microflora contributed to any observed changes in IELs. Finally, by using laser capture microdissection (LCM) of small intestinal cryosections to harvest villus epithelium, flow cytometry to retrieve their IELs, and the DNA microarray-based data sets of IEL gene expression to direct quantitative reverse transcription-PCR measurements of the levels of specified mRNAs in each cell population, we could use this environmentally well defined system to identify enterocytic gene products affected by proliferative status that may impact on IEL development/survival. Our results show that the engineered proliferative abnormality is accompanied by a microflora-independent reduction in extrathymically educated γδ TCR+ CD8αα+ IELs. This change is accompanied by coordinate changes in the expression of enterocytic and γδ TCR +IEL gene products that probably help legislate the observed change in IEL representation. FVB/N mice hemizygous for a transgene containing nucleotides −1178 to +28 of rat Fabpi linked to TAgWt or TAgK107/8 are described in earlier reports (35Chandrasekaran C. Coopersmith C.M. Gordon J.I.

Conventionally raised animals were maintained in microisolators in a specified pathogen-free state. Normal and transgenic mice were rederived as germ-free by Caesarian section of transgenic mothers and transfer of their embryonic day 19 fetuses to plastic gnotobiotic isolators (Standard Safety Equipment Co.) containing germ-free foster mothers. The protocol used for this rederivation is described in a recent publication (6Hooper L.V. Mills J.C. Roth K.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A.

Both conventionally raised and germ-free mice were given sterilized BeeKay Autoclavable Diet (B & K Universal Inc.) ad libitum. All animals were maintained under a strict light cycle (lights on at 0600 h and off at 1800 h). Animals were genotyped using primers, tail DNA, and PCR conditions described in Ref. 36Coopersmith C.M. Chandrasekaran C. McNevin M.S. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. Some mice received an intraperitoneal injection of an aqueous solution of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 120 mg/kg) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (12 mg/kg) (Sigma) 90 min prior to sacrifice. Only male mice were studied. FVB/N transgenic mice and their wild type littermates were sacrificed at 6–8 weeks of age (n = 3 conventionally raised or germ-free animals/genotype/experiment;n = 3 independent experiments). The middle third of their small intestine (arbitrarily defined as jejunum) was immediately flushed with PBS and subdivided into five equal length segments. All were segments placed together in a tissue cassette, overlaid with OCT (Miles Scientific), and frozen in Cytocool II (Stephens Scientific). 100 serial 5-μm thick sections were cut parallel to the cephalocaudal axes of the segments. For each antibody surveyed, every 10th section was fixed for 20 min in methanol (at −20 °C), washed three times in PBS (3 min/cycle), and treated with PBS-blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were subsequently treated three times with TNT wash buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20; three cycles; 5 min/cycle) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with each of the following monoclonal antibodies (all from BD PharMingen, each diluted 1:1000 in TNB-blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5), 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5% blocking reagent from PerkinElmer Life Sciences)): (i) rat anti-mouse CD4 (clone H129.19); (ii) rat anti-mouse CD8α (clone 53-6.7); (iii) rat anti-mouse CD8β (clone Ly-32); (iv) hamster anti-mouse αβ TCR (β chain; clone H57-597); (v) hamster anti-mouse γδ TCR (δ chain; clone GL3); and (vi) hamster anti-mouse CD103 (integrin αIEL chain; clone 2E7). Following incubation with these primary antibodies, sections were washed in TNT buffer (three cycles, each 5 min). Biotin-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG1/IgG2a (BD PharMingen) or biotin-conjugated mouse anti-hamster IgG mixture (BD PharMingen) was added (final dilution of each = 1:100 in TNB blocking buffer). After a 30-min incubation with the secondary antibodies at room temperature, sections were treated three times with TNT wash buffer (5 min/wash cycle). The sections were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1:1000 in TNB) followed by three washes of 5 min each in TNT buffer. The final steps consisted of (i) adding biotinyl-tyramide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; diluted 1:100 in 1× amplification diluent from the same manufacturer) for 10 min; (ii) washing three times with TNT buffer (5 min/cycle); (iii) incubating the section with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-conjugated streptavidin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; diluted 1:500 in TNB) for 30 min, and (iv) performing three final rinses in TNT buffer. Two controls were performed to verify the specificity of the signals produced: (i) direct amplification of endogenous peroxidase activity alone without the addition of primary or secondary antibodies but with the addition of biotinyl-tyramide; (ii) direct amplification of endogenous peroxidase activity followed by omission of each primary antibody but with inclusion of all other steps and reagents. Only well oriented jejunal crypt-villus units were scored. “Well oriented” was defined as sectioned parallel to the crypt-villus axis with an unbroken epithelial column extending from the crypt base to the villus tip. The data were compiled as the number of IELs of a particular type per 1000 villus epithelial cells or per 100 crypt epithelial cells. A minimum of 100 jejunal crypt-villus units were scored per mouse. Data obtained with each antibody from all mice of a given genotype (germ-free or conventional) were averaged. Multilabel immunohistochemical studies were performed on sections of normal and transgenic mouse jejunums using rabbit anti-TAg (1:1000 in PBS-blocking buffer; kindly provided by Doug Hanahan, University of California, San Francisco, CA) and goat anti-BrdUrd (1:1000) (38Kim S.H.

Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with Cy3-labeled donkey anti-rabbit Ig and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled donkey anti-goat Ig (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch). 6–8-week-old transgenic mice and their normal littermates were sacrificed, and their jejunums were recovered (n = 3 germ-free and 3 conventionally raised mice/genotype/experiment; three independent experiments). Peyer's patches were identified by inspecting the serosal surfaces of the jejunal segment and were then excised. Each jejunal segment was subsequently opened with a longitudinal incision, washed in PBS, and cut into 1-cm pieces that were placed in 40 ml of ice-cold sterile PBS. The pooled segments from all three animals/genotype/experiment were washed five times in PBS (vigorous shaking), allowed to settle by gravity, and resuspended in 25 ml of R2 medium (RPMI 1640 buffer containing 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm sodium bicarbonate, 1% nonessential amino acids (Sigma), and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The mixture was shaken gently for 30 min at 37 °C and then rigorously for 2 min at room temperature. The intestinal segments were allowed to settle by gravity, and the supernatant was collected and passed through a Nytex filter (Becton Dickinson). The flow-through, containing IELs and epithelial cells, was passed over a column of dimethyldichlorosilane-treated glass wool fiber (0.5 g/10-ml syringe) preequilibrated in R2 medium. The flow-through was spun at 1500 × g for 5 min, and the resulting cell pellet, highly enriched for IELs, was resuspended in 10 ml of R2 medium. The suspension was centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 5 min, and the pellet resuspended to a final concentration of 107 cells/ml of FACS staining buffer (RPMI, 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 1 mg/ml human IgG (Sigma)). IELs were stained with the following antibodies in various combinations (all from BD PharMingen; all diluted 1:100 in FACS staining buffer): (i) phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated hamster anti-mouse αβ TCR (β chain; clone H57-597); (ii) PE-conjugated hamster anti-mouse γδ TCR (δ chain; clone GL3); (iii) PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8β.2 (clone 53-5.8); (iv) FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD8α (clone 53-6.7); (v) FITC- or PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5); (vi) FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11); and (vii) biotinylated hamster anti-mouse CD103 (integrin αIEL chain; clone 2E7). Biotinylated primary antibodies were visualized with FITC-streptavidin or PE-streptavidin (BD PharMingen). Idiotype as well as secondary antibody alone controls were also performed. Following incubation with these reagents (60–90 min on ice), cells were spun for 5 min at 1500 × g, washed with sterile ice-cold PBS, and examined by flow cytometry (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson). γδ TCR+ IELs were isolated from jejunal segments that had been removed from 6-week-old germ-free male transgenic mice and their normal littermates. The γδ TCR+, CD103+ lymphocyte population was sorted (FACS Vantage; Becton Dickinson), collected in sterile cold PBS, and recovered by centrifugation (1000 ×g for 5 min at room temperature). RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen) (5 mice/IEL preparation; n = 10 preparations/genotype). RNA was also isolated from intact jejunal segments (n = 10 germ-free mice/genotype). LCM was conducted using jejunal cryosections that had been stained briefly with eosin Y and methyl green. Dissection of villus epithelium was restricted to well oriented crypt-villus units and was accomplished using the PixCell II system (Arcturus; 7.5-μm diameter laser spot), CapSure HS LCM Caps (Arcturus), and protocols described in Ref. 40Stappenbeck T.S.

RNA was prepared from captured cells from each mouse in each group using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit (Arcturus). The concentration of each preparation was defined (RiboGreen RNA quantitation kit; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and equally sized aliquots from members of a group of animals were pooled.

We have previously shown that the Rho signaling pathway modulates ER transcriptional activation. We now demonstrate that Rho GDI-dependent increase in ER transactivation is dependent on the ER AF-2 coactivator binding site, prompting us to examine regulation of receptor coactivators by Rho GDI. Indeed, Rho GDI cooperates with GRIP1 to increase ER ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transactivation and also enhances GRIP1 transcriptional activity when GRIP1 is tethered to DNA. The GRIP1 activation domain 1 (AD1), which binds CBP/p300, is necessary for Rho GDI to modulate GRIP1 activity. Using E1A to inhibit the endogenous CBP/p300 and a Gal4-CBP fusion protein to assay CBP activity, we find that the effect of Rho GDI on ER transactivation is CBP/p300-dependent. Importantly, the ability of CBP/p300 to transduce the Rho GDI signal to ER occurs through both GRIP1-dependent and -independent pathways. These data suggest a complex interplay between ER transcriptional activation and the Rho signaling pathways through modulation of receptor cofactors, which may have evolved to coordinate receptor-dependent gene expression with Rho-regulated events, such as cell migration.

We speculate that dysregulation of the Rho-ER axis may participate in cancer progression. estrogen receptor α activation factor cAMP response element-binding protein CREB-binding protein thymidine kinase DNA-binding domain mitogen-activated protein kinase guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor The estrogen receptor α (ER)1 is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that is an important regulator of cell growth, differentiation, and malignant transformation. Transcriptional activation by ER is accomplished through specific and general cofactor complexes that assemble with the receptor at target promoters to regulate transcription. Although many cofactors have been described that participate in ER transcriptional regulation, the cellular signals and physiological contexts that modulate the activity of these cofactors are not well understood. ER contains at least two transcription activation functions (AFs); constitutively active AF-1 in the N terminus of the protein and ligand-dependent AF-2 at the ER C terminus. These AFs represent surfaces capable of interaction with general transcription factors (GTFs) and additional transcriptional regulatory factors termed coactivators. Estradiol binding to the ER promotes a conformational change in the receptor and the formation of a surface for protein-protein contacts between AF-2 and coactivators. Among the numerous coactivators identified to date, one of the best characterized is the p160 family of proteins comprised of SRC1 (NcoA1), GRIP1 (TIF2, NcoA2), and RAC3 (ACTR, AIB1, P/CIP, TRAM). Although initial characterization of p160 proteins indicate that they participate in transcriptional activation by ER through AF-2 and interact with the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner (1Hong H. Kohli K. Garabedian M.J. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2735-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 2Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These interactions are mediated by two distinct regions on the p160s: the central nuclear receptor (NR) boxes bind ER AF-2 (5Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar), whereas the p160 C terminus interacts with the ER N-terminal A/B domain (4Webb P. Nguyen P. Shinsako J. Anderson C. Feng W. Nguyen M.P. Chen D. Huang S.M. Subramanian S. McKinerney E. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The p160 proteins are believed to enhance ER transactivation by recruiting other transcriptional regulatory factors through two activation domains, AD1 and AD2. AD1 interacts with CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 (6Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar), whereas AD2 has been shown to associate with the coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) and the p68/72 family of proteins, which also bind to the ER A/B domain (7Chen D., Ma, H.

ER recruits CBP/p300 both indirectly, through an association with the p160 proteins, as well as directly, through the ER A/B domain, thereby increasing AF-1 activity and facilitating the interaction between ER AF-1 and AF-2 (9Kobayashi Y.

CBP and p300 are multifunctional proteins that stimulate ER transactivation by interacting with components of the basal transcriptional machinery such as RNA Pol II, TBP, and TFIIB, and facilitate an association with other transcription factors and coregulators such as p/CAF (10Yang X.J.

Additionally, CBP/p300 contains a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity that acetylates both histone and non-histone proteins, which, interestingly, include ER and the p160s (12Wang C., Fu, M.

Thus, a complex picture of signal transduction by ER is emerging that appears to rely on a collaboration of multiple factors for regulation of gene expression. We have previously demonstrated that ER transcriptional activation is increased by overexpression of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor alpha (Rho GDI), and this effect is mediated through an inhibition of Rho GTPases (14Su L.F. Knoblauch R. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3231-3237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Rho GDI is a cytoplasmic protein that acts as a negative regulator of Rho GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, by blocking the dissociation of GDP (15Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In addition, Rho GDI controls subcellular localization of the Rho GTPases through binding the C-terminal isoprenoid modification, thus preventing their insertion into the plasma membrane and modulating the ratio of the active membrane-bound and inactive soluble forms of Rho proteins (16Bilodeau D. Lamy S. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this report we analyze the mechanism by which Rho GDI increases ER transcriptional activity. We determine the contribution of the ER transcriptional activation domains and examine the activity of p160 and CBP/p300 receptor cofactors by Rho GDI. Our results indicate that the Rho GDI signal is transduced to ER by CBP/p300 through GRIP1-dependent and -independent pathways.

For each transfection, pCMV-LacZ plasmid produced β-galactosidase and was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Human osteosarcoma U2OS (HTB 96) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 10 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Cellgro), and 2 mml-glutamine (Cellgro). 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto 35-mm plates in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Transfections using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) were performed according to manufacturer's recommendation. The total amount of DNA transfected is held constant in each transfection using the corresponding empty vector. Cells were treated with 100 nm 17β-estradiol, 100 nm4-OH-tamoxifen, or ethanol vehicle 12 h post-transfection for 24 h. If no treatment is indicated, cells were harvested 36 h after transfection. Transfected cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was quantified in a reaction mixture containing 25 mmglycylglycine pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, using an LB 9507 luminometer (EG&G Berthold) and 1 mmd-luciferin as substrate. The transcriptional activity for ER and Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins are normalized to reporter activity in the absence of transfected transcriptional activators, β-galactosidase activity as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and to protein concentration as determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). To prepare protein extracts from transfected cells, cells were lysed with 1× sample buffer, containing 2% SDS, 0.1m dithiothreitol, and 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8. Whole cell extract was normalized for total protein, boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer, and fractionated on either 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, for detection of GRIP1 and Rho GDI, respectively. Gel-fractionated proteins were then transferred to immobilon membrane (Millipore) and probed with anti-ERα polyclonal antibody (HC-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GRIP1 polyclonal antibody (PA1–846, Affinity Bioreagents), or anti-Rho GDIα polyclonal antibody (A-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit antibodies and the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) substrate as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). To understand how Rho GDI regulates ER transcriptional enhancement, we first examined whether the activities of AF-1 or AF-2 were modulated by Rho GDI expression. The contribution of each of these two transcriptional activation functions can be distinguished by using tamoxifen, which binds the ER ligand binding domain and alters the conformation of AF-2 such that coactivator association is disrupted. We transiently transfected U2OS cells with ER and Rho GDI expression vectors, and assessed ER transcriptional activation in the absence of ligand and in the presence of estradiol and tamoxifen on an ER-responsive reporter plasmid. ER activation by Rho GDI is roughly 7-fold upon estradiol stimulation and only 2-fold in the presence of tamoxifen (Fig. 1 A; comparelanes 5 and 6 to lanes 9 and10), suggesting that ER AF-2 mediates the majority, but not all of Rho GDI-dependent ER activation. To further examine the role of AF-2 in mediating Rho GDI signaling, we used an ER derivative defective in p160 association. This mutant ER (ER2L) contains twin leucine to alanine mutations at amino acids 539 and 540, which are located on helix 12 that forms a part of the p160 binding surface. It has been previously shown that these alterations decrease coactivator association with ER (18Mak H.Y. Hoare S. Henttu P.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3895-3903Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), without affecting ligand- or DNA-binding (19Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand treatment, we observed a 7-fold increase in wild type ER transcriptional activity by expression of Rho GDI, but only a 2-fold increase on ER2L (Fig. 1 A; compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 3 and 4). Likewise, in the presence of estradiol, Rho GDI is less effective at increasing ER2L activity as compared with wild type ER (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5–8). The ability of specific mutations in the coactivator binding site to disrupt Rho GDI-mediated increase in ER transactivation supports the hypothesis that Rho GDI regulates ER largely by modulating ER AF-2 activity, implicating alterations in p160 binding or activity. Interestingly, Rho GDI does appear to regulate ER in an AF-2-independent manner, as neither tamoxifen treatment, AF-2 disruption by mutagenesis (ER2L), nor a combination of both completely abolish Rho GDI-dependent increase in ER transcriptional activity (Fig.1 A, lanes 9–12). Taken together, these data suggest that induction of ER transactivation by Rho GDI is mediated largely by an ER AF-2-dependent and to a lesser extent an AF-2-independent mechanism. To further examine the effect of Rho GDI on ER activation domains, we tested whether Rho GDI can regulate AF-1 or AF-2 independently using ER fragments containing either AF-1 (ER1–269) or AF-2 (ER282–595) fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Rho GDI increases the transcriptional activity of ER AF-2 in a ligand-dependent manner roughly 5-fold, providing further support for Rho GDI as an activator of ER AF-2. Additionally, Rho GDI increases the transcriptional activity of ER1–269 about 2-fold, consistent with AF-2-independent ER induction by Rho GDI in the presence of tamoxifen or mutations in the AF-2 coactivator binding site. Since a majority of Rho GDI-mediated increase in ER transcriptional activation is dependent on AF-2, which binds p160 coactivators, we examined the relationship between Rho GDI and the p160 coactivator GRIP1. As shown in Fig.2 A, in the absence of hormone, ER transactivation is increased 3-fold by overexpressed Rho GDI, 3-fold by GRIP1, but is increased 22-fold when Rho GDI is coexpressed with GRIP1. Similarly, Rho GDI and GRIP1 together induce a 15-fold increase in ER transactivation upon estradiol treatment. This increase in ER transactivation is not the result of elevated ER protein expression (Fig. 2 A, bottom panel) and ER nuclear localization is not affected by GDI or GRIP1 expression (not shown). To determine if transcriptional synergy between GRIP1 and Rho GDI is a feature unique to GRIP1, we tested the effect of Rho GDI with the other members of the p160 family, SRC1 and RAC3. SRC1 also cooperates with Rho GDI to increase ER transactivation, although the fold induction of SRC1 with Rho GDI on ER transcriptional activation is less pronounced as compared with GRIP1, with only a 3-fold increase in the absence of ligand and a 6-fold enhancement upon estradiol treatment (Fig.2 B). In contrast, we were unable to demonstrate a significant increase in ER activation by RAC3 and Rho GDI over that of Rho GDI alone (Fig. 2 C). These differences may reflect functional diversity between GRIP1, SRC1, and RAC3 or different levels of p160 expression. Since in our system Rho GDI cooperated most strongly with GRIP1, we have focused our efforts on characterizing the effect of Rho GDI on GRIP1. To determine the mechanism by which Rho GDI and GRIP1 increase ER transactivation, we first examined whether Rho GDI increases GRIP1 transcriptional activity. Although GRIP1 is not a sequence-specific transcription factor, it contains two activation domains whose activity can be monitored by tethering GRIP1 to DNA via a heterologous DNA binding domain. Rho GDI increased the transcriptional activity of GRIP1 fused to the Gal4-DBD (Gal4-GRIP1.FL, Fig. 3 A) roughly 3-fold (Fig.3 B), suggesting that Rho GDI is an upstream regulator of GRIP1, which amplifies its coactivation potential, thereby increasing ER transcriptional activation. These results also suggest that it is the activity of GRIP1, rather than GRIP1 binding to ER, that is stimulated by Rho GDI. We next mapped the GRIP1 domain mediating the effect of Rho GDI on ER using GRIP1 derivatives lacking AD1 (Gal4-GRIP1.ΔAD1), AD2 (Gal4-GRIP1.ΔAD2), or AD1/2 (Gal4-GRIP1.ΔAD1/2) (Fig.3 A). Our results indicate that deletion of AD1 or AD1/2 abolishes the Rho GDI-dependent increase in GRIP1 activity, whereas deletion of AD2 does not (Fig. 3 C). Although deletion of AD2 resulted in a large increase in GRIP1 activity, the activity of this derivative was further augmented by Rho GDI expression. This increase in GRIP1.ΔAD2 has not been explored. The expression of GRIP1 variants was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.3 C, bottom panel). Taken together, these results suggest that Rho GDI regulates GRIP1 transactivation, and that this requires the CBP/p300-interacting region, AD1. Since Rho GDI-responsive region of GRIP1 maps to the CBP/p300-binding domain, Rho GDI may increase GRIP1 activity by regulating CBP/p300 function. To determine if CBP/p300 is a downstream target of Rho GDI, we asked whether Rho GDI regulates the transcriptional activity of CBP. CBP-dependent transactivation was assayed by cotransfecting Gal4-CBP fusion protein with a Gal4 responsive reporter, with or without Rho GDI. Indeed, Rho GDI increases transcriptional activity of CBP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 A). The viral oncoprotein E1A has been shown to associate with the HAT domain and the neighboring CH3 region of CBP and p300, thereby inhibiting their HAT-dependent and -independent activities (10Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 20Kurokawa R. Kalafus D. Ogliastro M.H. Kioussi C., Xu, L. Torchia J.

Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We cotransfected a Gal4 fusion of full-length GRIP1 with or without Rho GDI and in the presence or absence of E1A-12S. As shown in Fig. 4 B, E1A decreases GRIP1 activity and completely blocks stimulation of GRIP1 transactivation by Rho GDI, suggesting that CBP/p300 are required for Rho GDI to increase GRIP1 activity. The activity of a Gal4-GRIP1.ΔAD1derivative, which lacks the CBP/p300-interacting region, is not blocked by ectopic E1A expression, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of E1A on GRIP1-dependent transcriptional activation is specific for CBP/p300 (Fig. 4 C). These findings are consistent with our results that GRIP1's CBP/p300-interacting AD1 domain mediates the effect of Rho GDI on GRIP1. Furthermore, these results suggest that CBP/p300, in addition to GRIP1, may be largely responsible for mediating the increase in ER transactivation induced by Rho GDI. We next examined whether CBP is required for Rho GDI to increase ER transactivation, by cotransfecting ER and Rho GDI with E1A. Fig.5 A shows that inhibition of CBP/p300 by E1A inhibits ER transcriptional activity, consistent with the role of CBP/p300 as being important ER regulators in U2OS cells. Importantly, E1A also abolishes Rho GDI-mediated increase in ER transactivation without decreasing the level of ER or Rho GDI protein expression (Fig. 5 A, bottom panels). If CBP/p300 are required to transduce Rho GDI signaling to ER via GRIP1, we anticipate that E1A will decrease the cooperativity with respect to ER transactivation. Indeed, the addition of E1A reduced ER transcriptional activation (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 1 and5) and blocked the synergistic increase in ER activity induced by coexpression of Rho GDI and GRIP1 (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 4 and 8). Since CBP and p300 are inhibited by E1A, these results indicate that Rho GDI modulates ER activity through an E1A-sensitive step that most likely requires the activity of CBP/p300. Although inhibition of Rho GDI/GRIP1 synergy by E1A supports a model whereby Rho GDI activates ER through a CBP/p300-dependent step, it does not address whether recruitment of CBP/p300 to GRIP1 is important in this process. As CBP can also interact with ER directly, independent of p160 proteins, it is conceivable that the synergistic enhancement of ER transcriptional activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1 results from CBP/p300 both increasing ER transcriptional activation directly, as well as indirectly through an increase in GRIP1 activity. We examined the ability of GRIP1.ΔAD1 to increase ER transactivation synergistically with Rho GDI. Recall that the AD1 region of GRIP1 binds CBP/p300 and deletion of AD1 has been shown to abolish CBP/p300-mediated increase of GRIP1 function (22Chen D. Huang S.M. Stallcup M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Here, we show that GRIP1.ΔAD1, lacking a CBP/p300 binding site, is still able to enhance ER transactivation in the presence of Rho GDI (Fig.6 A). Thus, recruitment of CBP/p300 by GRIP1 only partly accounts for the ER activation by Rho GDI in combination with GRIP1. It is likely that CBP/p300 transduces Rho GDI signaling by binding and coactivating ER through parallel pathways involving both GRIP1 AD1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. To more closely examine the GRIP1 AD1-independent activity, we tested whether E1A is able to repress it, thereby implicating CBP/p300 in Rho GDI and GRIP1.ΔAD1 cooperativity. In agreement with previous experiments, co-transfection of Rho GDI and GRIP1 results in an increase in ER transactivation that is abolished by E1A expression (Fig. 6 B). Likewise, Rho GDI collaborates with GRIP1.ΔAD1, albeit at a reduced level. Importantly, this cooperative ER activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1.ΔAD1 is fully repressed by E1A, suggesting that CBP/p300 mediates GRIP1 AD1-independent ER activation by Rho GDI. We next examined the mechanism by which Rho GDI and GRIP1 cooperate to increase ER transactivation. p300 has been previously shown to bind and stimulate transcriptional activity of both ER AF-1 and AF-2, as well as increase ligand-induced interaction between these two activation domains (9Kobayashi Y. Kitamoto T. Masuhiro Y. Watanabe M. Kase T. Metzger D. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15645-15651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Since Rho GDI activates CBP/p300, and CBP/p300 also appear to be essential for cooperativity between Rho GDI and GRIP1, we speculated that ER activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1 may reflect a collaboration between ER AF-1 and AF-2. This hypothesis was tested using truncated receptors containing either the DNA binding domain and AF-2, but not AF-1, extending from amino acid 179 to 545 (ERAF-2) or the reciprocal receptor derivative containing the DNA binding domain and AF-1, but not AF-2, from amino acids 1 to 269 (ERAF-1) (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig.7 B, no synergy between Rho GDI and GRIP1 is observed on either the isolated ERAF-2 or ERAF-1, suggesting that both domains play an essential role in mediating cooperative ER activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1. These data suggest that induction of ER transcriptional activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1 relies on the cooperative actions of ER AF-1 and AF-2. Since AF-1 phosphorylation sites at Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 are important for AF-1 activity, we next addressed the role of AF-1 phosphorylation in mediating cooperativity between Rho GDI and GRIP1. Using full-length ER with a serine to alanine mutation at Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 (ERAAA), we demonstrate that Rho GDI alone or in combination with GRIP1, is able to increase ERAAA activity comparable to its effect on wild type ER (Fig. 7 B). Thus, although the AF-1 domain is important for Rho GDI to induce ER transactivation, Rho GDI action on ER is not mediated by the AF-1 phosphorylation sites examined. We provide evidence that Rho GDI increases ER transactivation by regulating the transcriptional activity of both AF-1 and AF-2 through the coactivators GRIP1 and CBP/p300. Several lines of evidence suggest the cooperative induction of ER by Rho GDI and GRIP1 is mediated by CBP/p300. First, this cooperativity is dependent in part on AD1, the CBP/p300 interacting domain of GRIP1. Second, Rho GDI stimulates the transcriptional activity of CBP tethered to DNA. Third, inhibition of endogenous CBP/p300 by the viral oncoprotein E1A blocks the increase in ER transcriptional activity by Rho GDI, as well as cooperativity between Rho GDI and GRIP1 on ER transactivation. While E1A also binds a component of the mammalian Mediator complex, hSur2 (23Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 24Boyer T.G. Martin M.E. Lees E. Ricciardi R.P. Berk A.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which is a subunit of the DRIP/TRAP complex that binds nuclear receptors and stimulate ER transactivation (25Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that inhibition of this complex results in the E1A-mediated inhibition of ER transcriptional activation, since the E1A-12S isoform used is the alternative splice product that does not interact with hSur2. Rather, we suggest that the Rho GDI-dependent increase in ER transactivation is through an E1A-sensitive step that most likely involves CBP/p300. How might Rho GDI increase ER transactivation cooperatively with GRIP1? We speculate that Rho GDI increases GRIP1 transcriptional activity through enhancement of CBP/p300 binding or activity. However, because a GRIP1 derivative that no longer binds CBP/p300 (GRIP1.ΔAD1) retains some activity, Rho GDI may also cooperate with GRIP1 via an AD1-independent mechanism. This mechanism, nevertheless, appears to involve CBP/p300 since cooperative ER activation by Rho GDI and GRIP1.ΔAD1 is E1A-sensitive. Taken together, our data suggest that Rho GDI enhances ER transcriptional activation by stimulating CBP/p300 action, which, in turn increases ER transactivation via parallel GRIP AD1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Fig.8). This result is consistent with recent findings from the Kraus laboratory that demonstrate CBP/p300 interactions with GRIP1 are required for ER transcription initiationin vitro (26Kim M.Y. Hsiao S.J. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Our initial studies suggested that Rho GDI increases ER transactivation largely by regulating ER AF-2, as inhibition of AF-2 activity either pharmacologically using tamoxifen or with ER mutations, greatly diminishes the effect of Rho GDI on ER (Fig. 1). However, in light of the observation that AF-1 deletion abolishes synergistic increase in ER transactivation by Rho GDI and GRIP1 (Fig. 7), it appears that ER AF-1 plays an essential role in permitting Rho GDI and GRIP1 to cooperatively enhance ER transcriptional activity. This requirement for ER AF-1 is also consistent with ligand-independent induction of ER by Rho GDI and GRIP (Fig. 2 A). Thus, both ER AF-1 and AF-2 are necessary, but individually not sufficient for the cooperative effect of Rho GDI and GRIP1 on ER transcription activation. We suggest that the synergistic increase in ER activity most likely reflects a collaboration between ER AF-1 and AF-2, with both contributing to overall transcriptional enhancement. Our data are consistent with a model whereby Rho GDI overexpression increases the number of CBP/p300 molecules recruited to ER, either directly or indirectly through GRIP1 binding, thereby enhancing the functional interaction between AF-1 and AF-2 (Fig. 8). While the AF-1 domain is required for Rho GDI to induce ER transactivation, Rho GDI action on ER does not require Ser-104, Ser-106, and Ser-118 phosphorylation sites (Fig. 7 B). Thus, direct phosphorylation of Ser-104 and Ser-106 by cyclinA/Cdk2 (17Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22296-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 27Trowbridge J.M. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) or cyclinH/Cdk7 (29Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) is unlikely to mediate Rho GDI-dependent increase in ER transcriptional activity. However, MAPK activation and cell cycle regulation by the Rho signaling pathway may still contribute to changes in ER transactivation via phosphorylation and modulation of coactivator function. Indeed, recent studies have shown that the p160 coactivators are modified by MAPK signaling (30Lopez G.N. Turck C.W. Schaufele F. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22177-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Font de Mora J. Brown M. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4475-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). CBP/p300 are also targets for MAPK phosphorylation, which appears to stimulate HAT activity (33Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 34Liu Y.Z. Thomas N.S. Latchman D.S. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1239-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 35Liu Y.Z.

Duquet A. Robin P. Rudkin B. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As MAPKs regulate p160 and p300/CBP activity, a link between the MAPK pathway and Rho GDI-dependent increase in ER transactivation appears plausible. Alternatively, GRIP1 and CBP/p300 may be regulated by other common effectors of the Rho signaling pathway, such as the PAK family of serine/threonine kinases. Rho signaling has been implicated in transcriptional regulation of a handful of transcription factors, including SRF and NF-κB (37Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 38Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). We report here that Rho GDI targets CBP/p300 and increases CBP transcriptional activity. Since CBP and p300 modulate the activity of a large number of transcription factors, induction of CBP/p300 activity by Rho GDI could result in widespread changes in gene expression. Thus, it is possible that the role of Rho signaling in regulating gene transcription is currently underappreciated, with many more transcription factors responsive to Rho GDI still to be identified. With respect to ER transactivation, modulation of CBP/p300 and GRIP1 activity by Rho signaling pathways provide an additional regulatory input to modulate ER transcriptional activity in response to extracellular signals. Although the overall consequences of ER activation by Rho GDI is currently unknown, the interplay between Rho signaling and ER function may prove particularly important during normal development when regulation of cellular proliferation by ER may need to be coordinated with Rho-regulated events, such as cellular migration. Dysregulation of the Rho-ER axis may uncouple this regulation, thereby contributing to cancer progression. Activation of ER is an early mitogenic event in breast cancer; however, it has also been suggested that the receptor may restrict tumor progression by inhibiting cell invasion and metastasis. For example, introduction of ER into an ER-negative metastatic breast cancer cell line results in reduced invasivenessin vitro and metastatic tumor formation in vivo(39Garcia M. Derocq D. Freiss G. Rochefort H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11538-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, MCF-7 cells with a high ER content display decreased motility in vitro (40Platet N. Cunat S. Chalbos D. Rochefort H. Garcia M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ER-expressing breast tumors are less assertive and invasive with a more favorable disease outcome, whereas ER-negative tumors are typically more aggressive and metastatic, and are associated with a worse prognosis. Thus, although ER promotes cellular proliferation, it also appears to inhibit cell migration and loss of ER results in a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Interestingly, while ER expression is decreased in advanced breast tumors, the level of Rho GTPases increases with the degree of tumor progression (41Fritz G. Just I. Kaina B. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 682-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of RhoC is sufficient to stimulate invasion of melanoma cells and is overexpressed in a particularly aggressive type of breast cancer prone to early metastasis (42van Golen K.L., Wu, Z.F. Qiao X.T. Bao L.W. Merajver S.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5832-5838PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the dominant negative RhoA represses the invasiveness of melanoma cells (43Clark E.A. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Hynes R.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). The opposing effects of Rho GTPases and ER on cell invasion is consistent with a model where Rho GTPases inhibit ER transcriptional activity, thereby enhancing cell motility by blocking ER target genes that suppress cell migration. In contrast, Rho GDI overexpression would promote expression of ER target genes that restrain cell invasion by inhibiting Rho GTPases. It would be interesting to examine the effect of the Rho signaling pathway on endogenous genes regulated by ER, and determine whether Rho GDI specifically regulates genes involved in cell migration and invasion that correlate with breast tumor progression.

The most important molecule in these fibrotic processes is type I collagen, the prototype of the interstitial collagens. Type I collagen is a heterotrimeric molecule composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain encoded by separate genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, respectively. The transcriptional activities of these two genes are coordinately regulated so that under normal conditions and during fibrotic processes, such as those responsible for the fibrosing diseases, their expression is increased in parallel. It has been demonstrated that COL1A1 and COL1A2transcriptional regulation involves interactions between transcription factors and regulatory elements contained within their promoters and first introns. However, the precise elements involved in their abnormal transcriptional regulation and the transcription factors that participate in these interactions are not entirely known (reviewed in Refs. 7Jimenez S.A.

Indeed, it was demonstrated that Sp1 is involved in the transcriptional activation of theCOL1A1 promoter by the profibrogenic growth factor, TGF-β (25Greenwell P. Inagaki Y., Hu, W. Walsh M.

Almounajed G. Brenner D. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar); that there is greater than a 3-fold increase in DNA binding activity to Sp1-binding elements of the COL1A1 promoter in SSc fibroblast nuclear extracts in comparison to nuclear extracts from normal cells (35Hitraya E.G. Varga J. Artlett C.M. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 2048-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); and that there is increased phosphorylation of Sp1 in SSc cells (36Ihn H. Tamaki K. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2240-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The crucial role that Sp1 plays in the regulation of collagen gene expression suggests that agents capable of interfering with its binding or its activity may be effective in controlling the exaggerated fibrotic process in the fibrotic diseases. Recently, several studies demonstrated that certain DNA-binding drugs that resemble transcription factors in their preference for specific DNA sequences and DNA groove orientation are capable of causing a potent inhibition of the binding of transcription factors to their cognate DNA elements (37Chiang S.Y. Clifford J. Beerman A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3109-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Robinson H. Prieble W. Chaires J.B. Wang A.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8663-8670Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Martin B. Vaquero A. Priebe W. Portugal J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 40Portugal J. Martin B. Vaquero A. Ferrer N. Villamarin S. Priebe W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This inhibition is caused either by direct competition for DNA binding or by induction of DNA conformational changes. The results of these studies demonstrated that mithramycin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin, and the bisanthracycline WP631 are potent inhibitors of the formation of Sp1-DNA complexes. Given the importance of Sp1 on the regulation of collagen gene expression, it is expected that these agents may cause potent and selective inhibition of the expression of these genes. Indeed, one study demonstrated that mithramycin selectively inhibitedCOL1A1 gene expression in human fibroblasts (41Nehls M.C. Brenner D.A. Gruss H.J. Herrmann F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2916-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of newly discovered and more potent DNA-binding drugs than mithramycin on collagen gene expression and transcriptional activity. We chose to focus on mitoxantrone and WP631, two potent drugs shown previously to exert specific effects on Sp1 binding at very low concentrations. We found that WP631 and mitoxantrone are very potent inhibitors of fibroblast COL1A1 expression. WP631 showed greater than 10-fold higher potency than mitoxantrone. The inhibitory effects of the drugs on COL1A1 expression were shown to be due to inhibition of transcriptional activity of the gene that was exerted through the competition with Sp1 binding to the short COL1A1 promoter segment containing the most 3′ Sp1-binding element located at −87 to −82 bp. Both drugs were also shown to completely abrogate the stimulation of COL1A1 transcriptional activity induced by TGF-β, a process that involves the participation of Sp1. These results provide the basis for the potential use of Sp1-DNA intercalators as a novel and effective approach for the treatment of the fibrotic manifestations of various fibrotic diseases and for the modulation of the profibrogenic effects of TGF-β. Human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from skin samples as described previously (42Jimenez S.A. Freundlich B. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). All studies were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Thomas Jefferson University. Fibroblast cultures were established and maintained in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% vitamins, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (Cellgro, Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. When the cultures reached confluency, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid was added for 24 h prior to initiation of the experiments in order to optimize their level of collagen production. Mitoxantrone (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and WP631 (Calbiochem) was dissolved in distilled water. Both solutions were stored at −20 °C. All other chemicals were of reagent grade (Fisher). Four different fibroblast strains were studied. The cells were plated in 35-mm plastic culture dishes at a density of 100,000 cells per dish and cultured until they reached confluency. For dose-response studies, the cells were preincubated for 24 h and then incubated for 48 h with 500 pm to 100 nm mitoxantrone or with 50 pm to 50 nm WP631, and dose ranges to lack significant cytotoxicity were found. Induction of apoptosis by the drugs was examined employing the annexin V-FITC conjugate Apoptosis Detection Kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Annexin V binding to phosphatidylserine exposed in apoptotic cells after treatment of fibroblasts with various drug concentrations was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (43Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar, 44Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 15-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Propidium iodide, a marker for late apoptotic or necrotic processes, was also included. For assessment of cytotoxicity, cells in exponential phase of growth were exposed to various concentrations of the drugs. After 48 h the media containing the drugs were removed, and the cells were maintained in fresh media to allow proliferation for two-three doubling times (48 h) in order to distinguish between cells that remain viable and capable of proliferation and those that remain viable but cannot proliferate. The number of surviving cells was determined by using the MTT dye reduction assay (45Morgan D.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 79: 179-183PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tetrazolium compound MTT (3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to the wells (20 μl per well), and the cells were incubated for 3 h. In this assay, MTT is reduced by metabolically active cells (viable) to insoluble purple formazan dye crystals. At the end of the incubation period, 100 μl of detergent was added to the wells to solubilize the crystals and allow determination of absorbance at 560 nm using a spectrophotometer. Samples were read directly in the wells. The data were analyzed by plotting cell number versusabsorbance, allowing quantitation of changes in cell viability as the rate of tetrazolium reduction is proportional to the number of viable cells. In parallel with the cytotoxicity studies, type I collagen production was assessed. For this purpose, media recovered after drug treatment was subjected to indirect ELISA, and production of type I collagen was quantitated using an affinity-purified human collagen type I polyclonal antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) as described previously (46Bellon G. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 188-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 47Rosenbloom J. Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Sandorfi N. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Kucich U. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The effect of the drugs on collagen accumulation in the cell layers was analyzed by fluorescence immunomicroscopy essentially as described previously (47Rosenbloom J. Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Sandorfi N. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Kucich U. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts were plated on coverslips at a density of 40,000 cell/coverslip and when the cells reached confluency, 5 nmWP631 or 50 nm mitoxantrone was added for 48 h. After treatment, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. After washing off the fixing solution with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. The cells were incubated for 30 min with the affinity-purified anti-type I collagen antibody in blocking solution. After removing and washing the unbound antibody, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody in 4% normal goat serum with 0.05 Triton X-100 was added to the coverslips. Following the last staining step, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Slow Fade-Light Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). All steps of fixation were carried out at room temperature, and staining was carried out at 37 °C. Fluorescence was visualized using excitation filters (450–490 nm) and emission filters (500–550 nm) with a 495 LP dichroic filter (Chrome Technology, Brattleborough, VT). Scientific imaging software from IP Laboratories (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA) was used for image acquisition and analysis. Confluent fibroblast cultures were employed to examine the effect of WP631 and mitoxantrone on fibroblast collagen biosynthesis as described previously (42Jimenez S.A. Freundlich B. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 48Bashey R.I. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was removed, and 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing various concentrations of WP631 or mitoxantrone, 50 μg/ml ascorbate, 100 μg/ml β-aminoproprionitrile, and 5 μCi/ml [14C]proline (ICN Biomed, specific activity, 247 mCi/mm) was added. After 48 h of incubation, the media and cell layers were harvested and processed as described previously (42Jimenez S.A. Freundlich B. Rosenbloom J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1112-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 48Bashey R.I. Jimenez S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 76: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amount of radiolabeled, newly synthesized collagen was measured by a collagenase digestion assay (49Diaz A. Muñoz E. Johnston R. Korn J.H. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10364-10371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) employing pure bacterial collagenase (Invitrogen) in the presence of protease inhibitors. For gel electrophoresis, separate aliquots of media and cell layer lysates were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions as described previously (49Diaz A. Muñoz E. Johnston R. Korn J.H. Jimenez S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10364-10371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed for 5 h at 100 V constant voltage. In a separate time course experiment, cell cultures were incubated for 1–24 h with either 0.5 nm WP631 or 5 nm mitoxantrone. After electrophoresis the gels were processed for fluorography and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Fibroblasts were grown to confluency. Following incubation either under control conditions or with mitoxantrone or WP631 for 48 h, total RNA was isolated (50Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) employing the Qiagen Easy RNA extraction method (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For Northern hybridizations, 5 μg/μl aliquots of total RNA were electrophoresed on formaldehyde 1% agarose gels. The RNA was then transferred to Nylon+ membranes (Ambion, Austin, TX), and the filters were hybridized to 32P-radiolabeled human cDNA forCOL1A1, COL1A2, and GAPDH as described previously (47Rosenbloom J. Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Sandorfi N. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Kucich U. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of RNA loading and transfer were evaluated by probing with a ribosomal 18 S probe (Ambion). The filters were scanned by densitometry (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences), and the results were quantified to determine the relative amounts of mRNA (ImageQuant version 5.1 software; Amersham Biosciences). For determination of mRNA stability, confluent fibroblasts were cultured in T-75 flasks in the presence or absence of mitoxantrone (5 nm) or WP631 (0.5 nm) as described above. The cultures received α-amanitin (1 μg/ml) 4 h after addition of the drugs. Pairs of treated and untreated cultures were harvested at 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 h after the addition of α-amanitin, and total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern hybridizations as described previously (51Diaz A. Jimenez S.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were obtained, and sets of blots prepared with the same concentration of total RNA from all the samples were scanned in a laser densitometer as described previously (51Diaz A. Jimenez S.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The effect of the drugs on COL1A1 transcription was determined by an in vitro nuclear run-off assay. Fibroblasts were cultured in T-162 flasks for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5 nmmitoxantrone or 0.5 nm WP631 as described above. At the end of the treatment period, the cell layers were trypsinized, and nuclei were isolated, and transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (51Diaz A. Jimenez S.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Filters were exposed and then scanned and quantified using storage PhosphorImager (ImageQuant version 5.1 software, Amersham Biosciences). Transient transfections were performed employing the FuGENE transfection method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (52Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Cicchillitti L. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2219-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The fibroblasts were plated at 70% confluence in 35-mm dishes. The media were changed the following day, and 2 h later the cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of various plasmids. The constructs tested are progressive 5′-deletions of the human COL1A1 promoter each cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. All constructs end at nucleotide +42 bp to ensure a proper reading frame, and their 5′ end was at the following positions: −4 and −2.3 kb, and −675, −174, and −90 bp. The detailed procedures for the preparation of these constructs have been described previously (19Jimenez S.A. Varga J. Olsen A., Li, L. Diaz A. Herhal J. Koch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12684-12691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following transfections, fresh medium with or without drugs was added, and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and fractured by sonication. Total protein content of the cytoplasmic extracts was measured by the Bradford procedure (53Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and CAT activity was determined by thin layer chromatography (54Gorman C.M. Moffet O.S. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection was normalized by cotransfecting the vector containingEscherichia coli β-galactosidase followed by assays of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity (pCMV β-galactosidase, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The ability of the drugs to bind to the COL1A1 promoter and compete with Sp1 for its DNA-binding site was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in T-162 flasks, and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells exactly as described previously (47Rosenbloom J. Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Sandorfi N. Rosenbloom J.C. Abrams W.R. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Kucich U. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 52Saitta B. Gaidarova S. Cicchillitti L. Jimenez S.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2219-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a typical experiment a confluent 162-cm2 flask yielded ∼100 μg of crude protein. Protein concentrations were determined by a dye-binding assay, and the nuclear extracts were stored in small aliquots at −70 °C until used. Nuclear extracts were incubated with a synthetic 26-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the −90 to −64-bp region of the COL1A1 promoter containing the putative proximal Sp1-binding site (5′ CAC GGG CGG CCG GCT CCC CCT CTC CG 3′). The oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each binding reaction contained 5–10 μg of nuclear extract, 3 μg of double-stranded poly[d(I-C)] Amersham Biosciences), and∼5 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide (∼50,000 cpm). Competition studies were performed with 100-fold molar excess of an unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide or a mutated oligonucleotide in which nucleotides required for Sp1 binding were changed. For supershift studies fibroblast nuclear extracts were preincubated with 5 μg of anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) before incubation with the probe. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol in a total volume of 20 μl. For the competition studies, the radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide was preincubated for different time intervals with various concentrations of each drug prior to the addition of the nuclear extracts. After incubation, the DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probes in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed in 1× Tris acetate buffer at 30 mA for 120 min. The gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 24 h. The autoradiographs were quantified by densitometry. The effects of treatment of fibroblasts with the drugs on TGF-β-induced stimulation of COL1A1transcription were analyzed by transient transfections. Subconfluent cultured fibroblasts were transfected with −90 and −174-bpCOL1A1 promoter constructs as described above. Following transfections, fresh serum-free medium (AIM5, Invitrogen) supplemented with ITS (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) and 50 μmascorbic acid and containing either 5 mm mitoxantrone or 0.5 mm WP631 and 15 mm human recombinant TGF-β1 was added. After 48 h of culture, the cells were harvested and processed as described above. In experiments in which more than triplicate valu"

Here we show that sulfation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), and proteins in the Golgi apparatus is dramatically reduced by low concentrations of BFA in which Golgi morphology is unaffected and secretion still takes place. BFA treatment seems to reduce sulfation by inhibition of the uptake of adenosine 3′-phosphate 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) into the Golgi lumen, and the inhibitory effect of BFA was similar for HSPGs, CSPGs, and proteins. This was different from the effect of chlorate, a well known inhibitor of PAPS synthesis in the cytoplasm. Low concentrations of chlorate (2–5 mm) inhibited sulfation of CSPGs and proteins only, whereas higher concentrations (15–30 mm) were required to inhibit sulfation of HSPGs. Golgi fractions pretreated with BFA had a reduced capacity for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), but control level capacity could be restored by the addition of cytosol from various sources. This indicates that the PAPS pathway to the Golgi lumen depends on a BFA-sensitive factor that is present both on Golgi membranes and in the cytoplasm.

No genetic disorder has been connected with later steps in the sulfation pathway, but the molecular basis is still unknown in the majority of osteochondrodysplasias. Localization of enzymatic activities to different regions of the Golgi apparatus has been facilitated by use of the fungal isoprenoid metabolite brefeldin A (BFA).

In several cell types, the synthesis of HSPGs may be completed in the presence of BFA although with significantly reduced efficiency, whereas CSPG synthesis is not detected, which indicates that separate enzyme systems in early and late subcompartments of the Golgi complex are involved in HSPG and CSPG synthesis, respectively (15Spiro R.C.

Two kidney epithelial cell lines, MDCK and PtK, have Golgi stacks that are morphologically resistant to BFA treatment (14Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J.

Despite this fact, apical protein secretion is reduced in MDCK cells already at low BFA concentrations, whereas basolateral secretion initially compensates for the reduction in apical secretion and is not inhibited until 20-fold higher BFA concentrations are applied (22Low S.H. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17729-17732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Low S.H. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Here we report a novel effect of BFA in MDCK cells. At low concentrations of BFA in which the Golgi apparatus is morphologically intact, the sulfation of proteins and PGs was dramatically reduced. This effect seemed to be caused by a reduction in the uptake of PAPS into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. Lowering the cytoplasmic PAPS level by chlorate also resulted in reduced PAPS levels in the Golgi lumen but gave a different reduction profile in the incorporation of sulfate into CSPG, HSPG, and proteins. The reconstitution in vitro of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain synthesis by incubating MDCK Golgi fractions with UDP sugars, [35S]PAPS, Mg2+, and Mn2+ was impaired when the Golgi fractions were pretreated with BFA. This impairment was overcome by the addition of cytosol from pig brain, rat liver, or MDCK cells. Our results indicate that sulfation within the Golgi depends on a factor present both in the cytoplasm and on Golgi membranes. Bovine serum albumin,N-ethylmaleimide, ε-aminocaproic acid, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2,4-dinitrophenylalanine, Dextran Blue, Triton X-100, and UDP sugars were all from Sigma. Chondroitin ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4.) was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Protein A-Sepharose 4B, DEAE-Sephacel, and Sephadex G-50 Fine and Superfine were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. [35S]Sulfate, [3H]glucosamine,14C-labeled molecular mass standards and Amplify were fromAmersham Biosciences. [35S]PAPS was obtained from Marco Maccarana (University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden) or PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Brefeldin A was purchased from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). NOVEX 4–20% Precast Tris glycine gels were purchased from NOVEX (Encinitas, CA). Sodium chlorate and other inorganic chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) with the exception of guanidine hydrochloride, which was purchased from (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). All tissue culture plastics were purchased from Costar Europe (VC Badhoevedorp, Holland). DME medium, fetal calf serum (FCS), l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from B.I. Bio-Whittaker (Verviers, Belgium). Sulfate-free RPMI 1640 and DME media without Arg, Cys, Gln, Leu, Met, glucose, inositol, and phosphate and the necessary additives were purchased from Invitrogen. MDCKII cells were grown as described previously (24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cells were established on polycarbonate filters (pore size 0.4 μm; diameter 24.5 mm, Costar Transwell) at a density of 106 cells/filter unless otherwise described. The cells were used for labeling 3–4 days later. An evaluation of filter-grown epithelial monolayers and [35S]sulfate labeling in sulfate-free medium was carried out as described previously (25Svennevig K. Prydz K. Kolset S.O. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Labeling with [3H]glucosamine was carried out in DME medium without Arg, Cys, Gln, Leu, Met, glucose, inositol, and phosphate supplemented with all additives with the exception of glucose. After metabolic labeling with [35S]sulfate or [3H]glucosamine, the medium fractions were harvested, eventual free cells were removed by centrifugation, and an equal volume of 8 m guanidine, 4% Triton X-100, 0.1 msodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, was added. The cell fraction was washed twice (5 min each) with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in 4 m guanidine, 2% Triton X-100, 0.05m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. To measure the level of [35S]sulfate incorporated into macromolecules, 1 ml of each fraction was applied to a 4-ml column of Sephadex G-50 Fine in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl. The first 1 ml of elute after application was discarded, the next 1.5 ml was collected, and an aliquot of this elute was counted for radioactivity in the scintillation counter. Free [35S] remained associated with the column, and the exchange of guanidine with Tris buffer made further analysis possible. 35S-Labeled macromolecules from cell and medium fractions obtained by Sephadex G-50 Fine chromatography were subjected to preparative ion-exchange chromatography. The samples were loaded onto columns (4-ml wet gel volume) in 0.05 m Tris/HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8.0, and washed with the same buffer. A gradient extending from 0.15 to 1.5 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris/HCl then was applied. Fractions of 2 ml were collected from the start of the chromatography. Aliquots of each fraction were counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (1900 TR, Packard, Downers Grove, IL) after the addition of Ultima Gold AB scintillation fluid (Packard). Fractions containing peaks of 35S-labeled material were pooled and dialyzed against water at 4 °C with a mixture of protease inhibitors containing 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Dialyzed samples were frozen until further analysis. Samples with 35S-labeled or3H-labeled PGs and proteins were boiled in sample buffer with 1% SDS and applied to precast 4–20% gradient NuPAGE gels from Novex. Standards used were 14C-labeled rainbow standards from Amersham. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed, treated with Amplify, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using Fuji Medical x-ray film (Tokyo, Japan). MDCKII cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate (0.1 mCi/ml) or [3H]glucosamine (0.2 mCi/ml) for 20 h after which the apical and basolateral media and the cell fractions were harvested. The cell fraction was solubilized directly into 0.05 mTris/HCl, pH 7.5, with 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The three fractions obtained were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit antiserum against mouse Perlecan (Dr. J. R. Hassell, Shriners Hospital, Tampa, FL). The fractions had been supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4 or 5 mm glucose to reduce unspecific binding of free [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine, respectively. The samples were subsequently incubated with protein A-Sepharose prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were washed and finally run on 4–20% Novex gradient gels. After electrophoresis, bands were visualized by autoradiography. Samples from media and cell fractions of ∼10,000 cpm were incubated with 0.01 units of enzyme as described previously (25Svennevig K. Prydz K. Kolset S.O. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The degraded material represented chondroitin/dermatan sulfate, and the samples were compared with untreated samples by SDS-PAGE by gel filtration chromatography on Superose-6 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The amount of HSPG was determined by degradation with nitrous acid at pH 1.5, as described by Shively and Conrad (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). NaOH treatment releases GAG, CS and HS chains from their protein cores by β-elimination. Samples (100–800 μl) of medium and cell fractions (in guanidine) were added to one-tenth of the sample volume of 5 m NaOH and incubated overnight at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 5 m HCl to pH 7.0–8.0. The lengths of the free GAG chains were analyzed by Sepharose Cl-6B column chromatography. The elution volumes and K av coefficients were determined relatively to the elution of the V o marker Dextran Blue and the Vt marker 2,4-dinitrofenylalanin or K2CrO4. Golgi-enriched subcellular fractions from control and BFA-treated MDCKII cells were prepared as described previously (14Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluency in 75-cm2 plastic flasks (Costar) in DME medium (24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In each experiment, two flasks were treated for 60 min with 1 μg/ml BFA in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, whereas two flasks were incubated in minimum Eagle's medium with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, alone. After homogenization, a post-nuclear supernatant was made and 840 μl of this supernatant was mixed with 660 μl of 2 m sucrose, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm HEPES, and this mixture was applied above a 6-ml gradient in SW 41 tubes as described previously (24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two more layers were applied; first 3 ml of 0.9 m sucrose, 1 mmHEPES, and finally 2 ml of homogenization buffer (0.3 msucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Golgi components could be recovered from the interphase between the two latter layers after centrifugation (33,000 rpm, 4.5 h in a Beckman SW 41 rotor). Incubation of Golgi fractions with [35S]PAPS was performed according to the translocation assay described by Brändli et al. (27Brändli A.W. Hansson G.C. Roudriguez-Boulan E. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16283-16290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variable amounts of Golgi protein were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 × 105 dpm [35S]PAPS in incubation buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 1 ml. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer, and Golgi vesicles were sedimented by centrifugation (40,000 rpm/60 min) TFT 65.13 rotor (Kontron). The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was carefully resuspended and repelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was subsequently dissolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the radioactivity incorporated in the pellet was determined in a 1900 TR scintillation counter (Packard) after the addition of Ultima Gold AB scintillation fluid (Packard). Protein was measured with the Biuret method or with the Lowry method as modified by Bensadoun and Weinstein (28Bensaduon A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Golgi fractions were isolated as described previously (14Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but in larger scale. Cells were grown to confluency in 500-cm2 square tissue culture dishes (Corning/Costar) in DME medium with 5% FCS (24Prydz K. Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In each experiment, one plate was treated overnight (20 h) with 2 μg/ml BFA in DME medium with FCS, whereas one plate was incubated in DME medium without BFA. After homogenization, a post-nuclear supernatant was made and 8.4 ml of this supernatant was mixed with 6.6 ml of 2 m sucrose, 10 mm CsCl, 1 mm HEPES, and this mixture was applied above a 10-ml gradient in SW 28 tubes (as described in previous paragraph). Two more layers were applied; first 5 ml of 0.9 m sucrose, 1 mm HEPES, and finally 5 ml of homogenization buffer (0.3m sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Golgi components could be recovered from the interphase between the two latter layers after centrifugation (28,000 rpm, 4.5 h in a Beckman SW 28 rotor). The Golgi fraction was recovered as described previously (14Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Prydz K.

The concentrations are indicated in each experiment. 35S-Labeled macromolecules were isolated by Sephadex G-50 Fine as described above and determined by scintillation counting and, in some cases, analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pig brain cytosol was isolated as described previously (29Garred Ø. Rodal S.K. vanDeurs B. Sandvig K. Traffic. 2001; 2: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sulfation involves the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to substrates for sulfotransferases located both in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus and in the cytosol. Glycolipids, glycoproteins, and PGs in transit to the cell surface are substrates for sulfotransferases localized to different regions of the Golgi apparatus. Sulfation within the Golgi requires efficient uptake of PAPS from its site of synthesis in the cytosol into the Golgi lumen. This uptake is mediated via PAPS transporters within the Golgi membrane (6Mandon E.C. Milla M.E. Kemper E. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10707-10711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Low S.H. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Subramaniam V.N. Hong W. J. Biol.

In our study, we have inhibited the incorporation of sulfate into proteins and PGs in two ways. One approach has been to inhibit the synthesis of PAPS in the cytoplasm by the addition of chlorate (30Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 31Kreuger J. Prydz K. Petterson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36267-36273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of chlorate (2–5 mm) reduced the sulfation of proteins and CSPGs, whereas the sulfation of HSPGs was unaffected at these chlorate concentrations but could be inhibited at higher concentrations of chlorate (15–30 mm). Fig.1 shows the pattern of incorporation of [35S]sulfate into macromolecules in the apical medium, the basolateral medium, and the cell fraction after the treatment of MDCK cells with different concentrations of chlorate during the labeling period. PGs are seen as broad bands in the high molecular weight region of the gel, whereas sulfated proteins are seen as more distinct bands with lower molecular weights. Clearly, protein sulfation is reduced by 2 mm chlorate and is essentially undetectable with 5 mm chlorate in all three fractions. Sulfation of PGs is still efficient at 30 mm chlorate although somewhat reduced. To determine whether sulfation of CSPGs and HSPGs was affected differently by chlorate treatment, the PGs were separated from proteins by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography and subjected to chondroitinase ABC or HNO2 treatment to degrade CSPGs or HSPGs, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the result from the apical medium. With increasing concentrations of chlorate, the relative fraction of PGs (i.e. HSPG) is increasing, and already with 5 mm chlorate, almost all of the PG is HSPG and very little is CSPG. At all of the higher concentrations of chlorate, only HSPGs were detected (data not shown). The results for the cell fractions were similar to those for the apical medium, whereas the basolateral medium contained essentially only HSPG (data not shown) (33Kolset S.O. Vuong T.T. Prydz K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1797-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that in MDCK cells, HSPG sulfation, which generally is completed before the trans-Golgi network, may operate at a lower cellular PAPS concentration than sulfation events (protein and CS) that take place in the trans-Golgi network (15Spiro R.C.

Chlorate acts as a specific inhibitor of sulfation, because the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into macromolecules was unaffected in the presence of 5 and 20 mm chlorate (Fig. 3).Figure 2Effect of chlorate on the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate. Filter-grown MDCKII cells were incubated for 22 h with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate without chlorate or in the presence of 2 or 5 mm chlorate in sulfate-free medium. At the end of the incubation period, the media were harvested and macromolecules were isolated by Sephadex G-50 Fine gel filtration before PGs were separated from proteins by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. Pooled and dialyzed PG fractions were analyzed by Superose 6 chromatography.

BFA treatment resulted in a decrease in sulfate-labeled macromolecules in both the apical medium, the basolateral medium, and the cell fraction (Fig. 4). The reduction, however, was first observed for the apical medium. This effect could be a combination of reduced sulfation and reduced apical secretion. We next wanted to investigate whether the effect of BFA was limited to the sulfation steps in GAG synthesis. To answer this question, we studied the incorporation of [3H]glucosamine and [35S"

In this study we have examined the ability of nitric oxide to inhibit polymerization by measuring the solubilizing effect of iron nitrosyl sickle hemoglobin (HbS-NO). Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to confirm that, as found in vivo, the primary type of NO ligation produced in our partially saturated NO samples is pentacoordinate α-nitrosyl. Linear dichroism spectroscopy and delay time measurements were used to confirm polymerization. Based on sedimentation studies we found that, although fully ligated (100% tetranitrosyl) HbS is very soluble, the physiologically relevant, partially ligated species do not provide a significant solubilizing effect. The average solubilizing effect of 26% NO saturation was 0.045; much less than the 0.15 calculated for the effect of 26% oxygen saturation. Given the small amounts of NO-ligated hemoglobin achievable through any kind of NO therapy, we conclude that NO therapy does not benefit patients through any direct solubilizing effect.

Ognibene F.P. Pannel L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Frye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In theory, one mechanism through which NO may benefit patients is to decrease sickle hemoglobin polymerization. It is believed that only T-state HbS polymerizes (7Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, at high oxygen pressures, like those found at the lungs, HbS molecules are in the R-state (high-affinity) and do not polymerize. In the tissues, oxygen pressure is low, and polymerization becomes more likely. The kinetics of polymerization have been described by an approximate, empirical equation relating the delay time (the time during which polymers are not detectable) to the supersaturation ratio (9Hofrichter J. Ross P.D. Eaton W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3034-3039Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, 1td=λ(c0/c8)nEquation 1 where td is the delay time, c0 is the total concentration of hemoglobin molecules, cs is the solubility of the hemoglobin, and λ is a proportionality factor. The exponent, n, is found to be about 30–40 under physiological conditions. Thus, the delay time is extremely sensitive to the supersaturation ratio, c0/cs. It has recently been proposed that nitric oxide (NO) binding at the heme group to form iron nitrosylated HbS (HbS-NO) may also play a role in increasing HbS solubility in vivo(10Head C.A. Brugnara C.

Biol. 1975; 96: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found that tetranitrosyl hemoglobin (100% saturated HbS-NO) polymerizes in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP). However, stripped 100% tetranitrosyl did not polymerize under the same conditions (14Briehl R.W. Salhany J.M J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Subsequently, McDadeet al. (11McDade W.A. Shaba H.M. Boler N. Mathies S. Anesthesiology. 1997; 87: A512Crossref Google Scholar) reported preliminary results indicating that even small amounts of NO can substantially reduce polymerization in purified HbS solutions and decrease sickling (12McDade W.A. Shaba H.M. Anesthesiology. 1999; 91: A749Google Scholar). The difference in the effect of various ligands may be related to the difference in their abilities to produce a T- to R-state transition upon binding HbS. The quaternary state of nitrosyl hemoglobin has been investigated using combinations of absorption, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies (15Trittelvitz E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20323-20333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The quaternary state of tetranitrosyl hemoglobin favors the R-state when it is stripped of organic phosphates such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) but favors the T-state in the presence of IHP (18Huang T-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11467-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Szabo A. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4427-4428Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When nitrosyl hemoglobin is in the T-state, the iron-proximal histidine bonds can break forming a pentacoordinate, NO-bound heme. This pentacoordinate species is responsible for the hyperfine splitting observed in EPR spectra. Thus EPR can be used to probe the quaternary state of nitrosylated hemoglobin. The pH, presence of organic phosphates and other solution conditions have a large influence on the quaternary state of nitrosyl Hb (HbNO) (18Huang T-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11467-11474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hille R. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12110-12120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is believed that only T-state HbS polymerizes, these conditions could also greatly affect the solubility of HbS-NO. In assessing the contribution the formation of HbS-NO may have in treating patients with sickle cell disease, it should be remembered that only very small amounts of NO can be administered (6Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannel L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Frye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Yonetani et al. (20Yonetani T. Tsuneshige A. Zhou Y. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20323-20333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) showed that when small amounts of NO are added to deoxyHb, α-nitrosyl hemoglobin forms (NO binds preferentially to the α hemoglobin subunits). The α-nitrosyl hemoglobin has an especially low affinity for oxygen and was thus referred to as in a Super T-state, which is detectable through its characteristic hyperfine splitting in its EPR spectrum (20Yonetani T. Tsuneshige A. Zhou Y. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20323-20333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In this study we have examined the solubility of partially ligated HbS-NO and 100% tetranitrosyl hemoglobin under conditions designed to mimic those in vivo. We find that although 100% tetranitrosyl HbS is very soluble, partial nitrosylation is unlikely to have any significant effect on the solubility of HbS under physiological conditions. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical. Blood was obtained from patients with sickle cell disease (SS) with low levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) who had not been recently transfused following federal regulations and guidelines. Electrophoresis was used to determine the levels of HbF (3.2 ± 2.1%) and HbA2 (5.0 ± 0.4%) in the samples. The hemolysate was prepared from these samples within 24 h of drawing as described previously (22Geraci G. Parkhurst L.J. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 17: 4664-4667Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The samples were kept cold during all preparatory procedures (on ice or at 4 °C). Blood cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 and lysed by incubation in distilled water. The membranes were spun down, and the hemolysate was then dialyzed against PBS buffer. Based on a colorimetric assay (Sigma Chemical) we found that this procedure results in a negligible change in the molar ratio of DPG to hemoglobin, consistent with earlier results (23Tomita S. Riggs A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 547-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of the most physiologically relevant allosteric effector was the same for our studies as that found in vivo. In some cases, when the sample volume was slightly inadequate for an experiment, small amounts of previously prepared hemolysate were used to increase the sample volume. Those samples had been pelleted in liquid nitrogen for storage. No effect of using the small amounts of previously frozen samples was observed. The hemolysate was concentrated using Centriprep and Centricon concentrating devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to a final concentration of 16–19 mm (in heme). After purging the samples with argon, sodium dithionite was added. Precautions in the general handing of and preserving the anaerobicity of dithionite were followed as described previously (24Poillon W.N. Kim B.C. Blood. 1990; 76: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dithionite was placed in a septum-capped bottle and purged with argon for about 2 h, after which PBS buffer that had been bubbled with argon gas (also for about 2 h) was added to make a stock dithionite solution. This was then added to the HbS sample that had been purged with argon to a final concentration of 50 mm. Iron nitrosyl hemoglobin was made by adding sodium nitrite to the deoxygenated samples as described previously (25Arnold E.V. Bohle D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 41-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A stock nitrite solution was made and bubbled with argon gas. An aliquot of the stock solution was added to the HbS sample that had been prepared with excess sodium dithionite. The nitrite was reduced by dithionite to form NO, which binds quickly to the hemoglobin, yielding nearly stochiometric iron nitrosyl hemoglobin. This procedure was carried out within 1 h after addition of dithionite. We found that this method was superior to exposing the hemoglobin directly to NO gas even when the system is properly flushed with an inert gas, and the NO is passed through NaOH to remove traces of higher nitrogen oxides (26Beckman J.S. Wink D.A. Crow J.P. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in nitric oxide research. Wiley, West Sussex1996: 61-70Google Scholar). We found that it is very difficult to remove all these unwanted nitrogen oxides and that we often would have large concentrations of nitrite in our NO-saturated buffer. Furthermore, we sometimes found a significant degree of protein denaturation when our Hb was exposed directly to NO gas. Finally, when exposing Hb directly to NO gas it was not possible to control the distribution of NO binding. One generally would need to make 100% tetranitrosyl Hb and then mix this with deoxyHb to achieve a partially saturated sample. If NO-saturated buffer is added directly to the Hb sample, it will bind faster than the sample can be properly mixed. To mimic in vivo conditions, where the concentration of NO is small, it was desirable for us to be able to make HbS-NO samples that had evenly distributed NO ligation. This is achievable using the nitrite reduction method since the rate of this reaction was measured to be 0.035 ± 0.007 1/s at 4 °C when using the same concentrations of nitrite and dithionite as those used in preparing HbS-NO for the solubility measurements. The rate was measured by monitoring the formation of HbS-NO when Hb + dithionite was rapidly mixed with sodium nitrite using an Olis RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Bogart, GA). By rigorously mixing nitrite solutions directly to the Hb + dithionite solutions on ice, we could achieve evenly distributed NO ligation. This is possible because the sample can be thoroughly mixed before NO is released, so there is no extreme local concentration of NO. If NO-saturated buffer is added to a hemoglobin solution, the NO will react faster than the most rapid mixing technique and will thus form a larger quantity of tetranitrosyl hemoglobin. For some experiments, nitrite was added in slight molar excess to Hb in order to make 100% tetranitrosyl Hb. This was also occasionally then diluted with deoxyHb for other experiments where we purposely made a sample that was initially composed of a mixture of tetranitrosyl hemoglobin molecules and completely deoxygenated hemoglobin molecules. The addition of dithionite resulted in a decrease in the pH of the PBS buffer from 7.4 to 6.8. The presence of Hb or nitrite did not affect the pH further as determined by a separate control experiment where we added HbS and nitrite to a dithionite solution. Although this pH is below physiological, it afforded us the possibility to work with slightly lower Hb concentrations (due to the reduced solubility) and thus conserve sickle cell blood. Furthermore, the same pH was used for both the HbS-NO samples and deoxyHbS controls. No significant difference in the type of iron nitrosyl ligation or the solubilizing effect of NO on HbS was found when the experiments were repeated in a Trizma buffer (pH 7.2 at 37 °C) with 0.1 m KCl and 0.02m NaCl. For each solubility measurement, deoxygenated HbS, nitrosylated HbS, and other necessary materials were assembled in a dry hood (model Dri Lab He-43–2, vacuum/atmosphere Corporation, Los Angeles, CA). The atmosphere in the hood was cycled between vacuum and argon several times before use. Inside the hood, the HbS-NO sample was prepared along with a deoxygenated sample to be used as a control. The HbS-NO sample and deoxyHb control were each then used to fill two Quick-seal polyallomer ultracentrifuge tubes for the TLS-55 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc.), two 0.01-cm path length cells, and two-0.1 cm path length cells (Hellma Inc., Plainview, NY). In addition, a portion of the HbS-NO sample was always used to fill an EPR tube (Wilmad/Lab Glass, Buena NJ, 701-PQ) and sometimes a second, screw-cap EPR tube was filled (701-TR). Thus, for all experiments, we were able to perform a variety of spectroscopic and other procedures on identically prepared HbS-NO and deoxyHb samples. The total concentration and percent of NO ligation was determined using visible absorption spectroscopy on the 0.01-cm path length cells. The absorption spectra were fit to basis spectra normalized by their extinction coefficient using a least-squared minimization. The absence of any methemoglobin was also determined in this way. The basis spectra used and a typical fit are shown in Fig.1. The percentage of HbS-NO was also determined by double integration of the EPR spectra (described in the next paragraph). The difference in using these two methods was only 2.2 ± 2.0%. The values of Hb nitrosylation reported in the results section are the averages of those determined by EPR and absorption. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was conducted on a Bruker Electron Spin Resonance-ER-200 D Spectrometer with a B-VT 1000/ER 4111 VT variable temperature unit set at temperatures of 140 K using a 5-milliwatt microwave power, 5 G modulation amplitude, and 9.36 GHz microwave frequency. A 0.1-s time constant was used for 100-s scans over 500 G. The concentration of HbS-NO on samples that had previously been frozen in liquid nitrogen, was determined by double integration of the spectrum using EPRWare for Windows (Scientific Software Services, Normal, IL) and compared with a standard HbS-NO sample. The type of nitrosyl ligation was determined by fitting EPR spectra to basis spectra shown in Fig. 2. These three basis spectra, pentacoordinate α-nitrosyl, hexacoordinate α-nitrosyl, and hexacoordinate β-nitrosyl represent the three types of possible NO ligations at the heme (19Hille R. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12110-12120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pentacoordinate α-nitrosyl Hb was made by incubating a 10% NO-saturated Hb sample in 0.2 m, pH 5, sodium phosphate buffer for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of a 2-fold molar excess of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP). The spectrum for the hexacoordinate β-nitrosyl Hb was obtained by subtracting the pentacoordinate α-nitrosyl component from a 100% NO-saturated sample prepared in 0.2m, pH 5, sodium phosphate buffer with IHP. The hexacoordinate α-nitrosyl spectrum was obtained by subtracting the β-nitrosyl component from a 100% NO-saturated Hb sample that had been stripped of organic phosphates using a G-25 Sephadex column (Amersham Biosciences) and prepared in 0.2 m pH 9 Trizma (Tris base) buffer. A few iterations of these types of procedures were necessary to produce the final spectra shown in Fig. 2. The spectra shown in Fig. 2 resemble those published previously that had been prepared by other methods (19Hille R. Olson J.S. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12110-12120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy was used to determine presence of HbS polymers in the 0.01-cm pathlength cells. The LD was measured on a LD/optical rotary dispersion (ORD) spectrometer developed by OLIS inc. (Bogart, GA). Light produced by a xenon lamp is sent through the patented rapid scanning monochromator that scans a spectrum every millisecond. The light then passes through a polarizer oriented at 45o with respect to the horizontal plane. After traversing the sample, the light passes through a photoelastic modulator (Hinds Instruments, Hillsboro, OR) and then through a beam-splitting polarizer producing horizontally and vertically polarized light. The two polarized beams are collected by two photomultiplier tubes and the difference divided by the sum of the intensities that is modulated by two times the reference frequency of the photoelastic modulator will be the ORD + LD. Since the ORD of hemoglobin is very small in the visible region, it can be ignored and any measured signal was attributed to LD of partially aligned sickle cell hemoglobin polymers. The delay time for polymerization was measured by observing the turbidity of the samples at 800 nm on either a PerkinElmer Lambda 9 spectrometer or a Cary 100 Bio UV/visible spectrometer. The samples were temperature jumped from 0 to 37 °C, and the turbidity was measured as a function of time. The samples were taken directly from ice to jacketed cell holders on the spectrophotometers. The temperature of the cells in the PerkinElmer machine was controlled by a Haake circulating bath (Paramus, NJ), and the temperature of the cells in the Cary machine was regulated by a Cary temperature controller. The centrifuge tubes were sealed in the dry hood and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow them to polymerize before measuring the solubility by centrifugation. As with the delay time measurements, every experiment included a HbS-NO sample and a deoxygenated HbS control prepared in the same way as the HbS-NO sample except without the addition of nitrite. The samples were spun at 214,000 ×g for 1 h at 37 °C as described previously (7Sunshine H.R. Hofrichter J. Ferrone F.A. Eaton W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 251-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The solubility was measured by determining the total concentration of hemoglobin in the supernatant using absorption spectroscopy as described above. LD was used to make sure that no polymers were present in the supernatant. We found no evidence for polymerization of 100% tetranitrosyl HbS from nine different preparations. Fig. 3shows the absence of any LD for a 100% tetranitrosyl HbS sample. It is compared with the LD of a deoxygenated sample and a partially nitrosylated one. For the deoxyHbS and partially nitrosylated HbS samples, one can flip the LD signal (as shown) by rotating the sample about the axis defined by the incident light. The ability to flip the signal is strong evidence that it results from LD of partially aligned polymers (27Shapiro D.B. Esquerra R.M. Goldbeck R.A. Ballas S.K. Mohandas N. Kliger D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26078-26085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a typical delay time measurement for a 100% tetranitrosyl sample compared with that for a deoxyHbS sample prepared from the same hemolysate. No polymerization is observed in the 100% tetranitrosyl sample.Figure 4Time delay measurement for 100% tetranitrosyl HbS compared with deoxyHbS. The turbidity was observed using the Cary 100 Bio UV/visible spectrometer at 800 nm using 0.1-cm pathlength cells. The concentrations of the 100% tetranitrosyl and deoxy samples were 16 mm. The delay times were calculated as the time to reach one-tenth of the final optical density after subtraction of the initial absorption at time t = 0. The delay time for the deoxy sample was 110 s while the 100% tetranitrosyl sample was greater than 7200 s (possibly infinity).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our solubility measurements also confirmed that 100% tetranitrosyl HbS is very soluble. If polymers are formed, the concentration in the supernatant following a sedimentation experiment should be equal to the solubility. When no polymers are formed, the concentration in the supernatant following sedimentation should be equal to the total concentration of HbS, and one can only say that the solubility is greater than or equal to the total concentration of the HbS. We found that the solubility of 100% tetranitrosyl HbS, prepared as a hemolysate in PBS buffer is greater than or equal to 19 mm. The solubility of partially ligated HbS-NO was measured for samples prepared in two different ways. In one method, submolar amounts of nitrite were added to HbS in the presence of dithionite. In the other method, 100% tetranitrosyl HbS was diluted with deoxygenated HbS. Although the first method should be able to achieve equally distributed NO ligation, the faster off-rate from the β-subunits always leads to the formation primarily of α-nitrosyl HbS. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the EPR spectrum for 100% tetranitrosyl Hb is compared with that of a partially ligated sample that was frozen after incubation at 0 °C (labeled before incubation) for 1 h and another that was incubated for an additional hour at 37 °C (labeled after incubation). The formation of α-nitrosyl HbS occurred both when 100% tetranitrosyl HbS was diluted with deoxygenated HbS and when the initial NO ligation was evenly distributed. The final amount of α-nitrosyl HbS was slightly less for the case when 100% tetranitrosyl is diluted with deoxyHbS (81 versus 87% when the NO ligation is initially evenly distributed). For each solubility measurement, the presence of polymers was confirmed by LD measurements (Fig. 3) and delay time measurements. We observed that increasing NO ligation to 26% had little effect on HbS solubility. For the sample where we tried to achieve even initial NO ligation for a final saturation of 26 ± 5%, we found the solubility to be 11.4 ± 0.8 mmcompared with a solubility of 11.0 ± 1.1 for the deoxy controls. For the samples where we mixed previously made 100% tetranitrosyl HbS with deoxyHbS for a final NO saturation of 26 ± 5% NO ligation the solubility was 11.6 mm ± 0.7 compared with 11.0 ± 0.1 for the deoxy controls. These results are illustrated graphically in Fig. 6.Figure 6Solubility of partially ligated HbS-NO.A, solubility of samples with even initial NO ligation.

However, its solubility is of general biochemical interest. We have found that it is very soluble. Briehl and Salhany (14Briehl R.W. Salhany J.M J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) found no evidence that stripped 100% tetranitrosyl HbS can polymerize, even in pH 6 Tris buffer with a concentration of 30 mm at 20 °C. In the presence of IHP at pH 7.2, they found that the minimum gelling concentration of HbS was between 24 and 30 mm at 20 °C. Based on their results and the fact that IHP promotes polymerization more effectively than phosphate or DPG (28Poillon W.N. Robinson M.D. Kim B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13897-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), one would predict that the solubility of 100% tetranitrosyl HbS in the presence of these physiologically relevant allosteric effectors would be between that of stripped HbS and that in the presence of IHP. Our results, using physiologically relevant concentrations of DPG, are consistent with this prediction. We have not seen evidence for polymerization of 100% tetranitrosyl HbS and have found the solubility to be greater than 19 mm. It is useful to compare the effect of NO (Fig. 6) on HbS solubility to that of oxygen. In order to calculate the solubilizing effect of oxygen we use empirical Equation 2 deduced by Eaton and Hofrichter (29Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), Cs(g/ml)=0.321−0.00883 TEquation 2 +0.000125T2+0.0924ys+0.0980ys3+0.235ys15where T is the temperature in degrees celsius and ysis the solution phase saturation with oxygen, which is very close to the overall HbS oxygen saturation.

SecYEG can associate with another trimeric complex consisting of SecD, SecF, and YajC that is required for efficient protein export in vivo (9Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). SecY and SecE are essential subunits of the translocase. SecY harbors 10 transmembrane segments (TMSs)1 (see Fig. 1), whereas SecE has a single TMS in most bacteria. In Escherichia coli, SecE contains three TMSs (see Fig. 1), but only the conserved C-terminal domain including the third TMS is essential for a functional translocase (10Schatz P.J. Bieker K.L. Ottemann K.M. Silhavy T.J. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). SecY forms a stable complex in the membrane with SecE that does not dissociate in vivo (11Joly J.C. Leonard M.R. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4703-4707Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and is rapidly degraded by FtsH when uncomplexed (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Several domains of SecY and SecE have been suggested to be in close contact. Mutations in the fourth cytoplasmic loop (C4) of SecY (13Baba T. Taura T. Shimoike T. Akiyama Y. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4539-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and C2 and TMS 3 of SecE (14Pohlschroder M. Murphy C. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19908-19914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) destabilize the SecYE complex. Furthermore, specific combinations ofprlA (SecY) and prlG (SecE) mutations result in synthetic lethality (15Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Prl (for proteinlocalization) is a class of mutants that suppresses signal sequence defects, and the synthetic lethality has been suggested to signify interactions between periplasmic loop 1 (P1) of SecY and P2 of SecE and TMS 7 and 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE (15Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed, cysteine-directed cross-linking studies demonstrated contacts between P1 of SecY and P2 of SecE (16Harris C.R. Silhavy T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3438-3444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and between TMS 3 of SecE and TMS 2 (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and 7 (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of SecY. Most of the conserved residues and prlAmutations are clustered in TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY. Furthermore, TMS 2 and 7 of Sec61α, the yeast homologue of SecY, have been implicated in the binding of the signal sequence of the preprotein (19Plath K. Mothes W. Wilkinson B.M. Stirling C.J. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1998; 94: 795-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest a conserved core of the translocase, consisting of TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE that is involved in preprotein binding. The SecYEG protomer is a dynamic complex that can organize into dimers and tetramers as revealed by electron microscopy, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, sedimentation analysis, and Blue Native (BN)-PAGE (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C.

An activated state of the SecA dimer (i.e. with a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog or with a trapped preprotein intermediate) was found to be associated with large ringlike SecYEG oligomers that could be fitted to the size of a SecYEG tetramer (20Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE demonstrates that a trapped preprotein intermediate remains stably associated with SecYEG dimers in the absence of SecA (22Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A chemical cross-linking study failed to demonstrate the presence of SecYEG oligomers, and it was suggested that such forms represent aggregates formed as an artifact of the overproduction (23Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, cysteine-directed cross-linking demonstrates that TMS 3 of SecE contacts a neighboring SecE molecule (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol.

Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whereas BN-PAGE indicates that the chemical cross-linking interferes with the oligomerization of SecYEG (22Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The exact number of SecYEG subunits within the active oligomeric translocase complex, however, is a topic of discussion. A central question is how the SecYEG complex forms the protein-conducting channel. To answer this, detailed information is required about the molecular architecture of the SecYEG complex. For this purpose, we have initiated a cysteine-scanning mutagenesis approach to probe sites of interaction between SecY and SecE (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A model has been presented in which one face of TMS 3 of SecE stably interacts with TMS 2 and 7 of SecY whereas the opposite face dynamically interacts with TMS 3 of a neighboring SecE molecule that is part of a separate SecYEG complex. The periodic reappearance of the contacts suggests the presence of α-helices as the secondary structure of the investigated transmembrane segments. Based on the conserved residues and the high incidence of prlA mutations in TMS 10 and observed synthetic lethal combinations of prlAand prlG mutations, we expected also that TMS 10 of SecY is located in the core of the translocase in close vicinity to SecE. Here, we indeed present evidence that TMS 3 of SecE contacts TMS 10 of SecY periodically in space. Using our combined data, a three-dimensional model is presented that compiles all the identified contacts in the membrane between SecY and SecE. This model reveals that TMS 3 of SecE is at the contact interface between two SecYEG protomers and must be strongly tilted to accommodate the various observed interactions. SecA (24Cabelli R.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The plasmids used to overproduce SecYEG are listed in Table I. Single cysteine mutations in TMS 10 were introduced by a two-step polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pET607 (that allows overexpression of a cysteine-less SecYEG with an N-terminal His6 tag on SecY) as the template (17Kaufmann A.

Combining cysteine mutations in TMS 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE was accompanied by the deletion of a ClaI site between SecY and SecE to facilitate the screening for correct mutants (17Kaufmann A.

Open table in a new tab Plasmids containing an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible trcpromotor before a synthetic secYEG operon were used for the overexpression of the Sec YEG complex. Cell growth and isolation of inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) were performed as described previously (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For assays of disulfide bridge formation, IMVs (1 mg/ml) were oxidized with 1 mmCu2+(phenanthroline)3 for 30 min at 37 °C. The oxidation reaction was quenched by the addition of 25 mm neocuproine (Sigma). Samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, Western blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and immunostaining using antibodies directed against SecY or SecE (27van der Does C. Manting E.H. Kaufmann A. Lutz M. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The stretches of amino acids representing TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE were constructed as α-helices with the HyperChem (Hypercube Inc.) software, exported in the Brookhaven PDB file format, and subsequently visualized with Weblab Viewer (Accelrys Inc.). The sites of contact between SecE and SecY and a neighboring SecE were highlighted, and a model was built by fitting the matching sites in the best possible way. Translocation reactions were essentially performed as described (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with the difference that the radioactive label (125I) on proOmpA was replaced by a fluorescent label (fluorescein maleimide), and translocated proOmpA was visualized with a Lumi-Imager F1 (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). 2J. de Keyzer, C. van der Does, and A. J. M. Driessen, submitted for publication. Protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Unique cysteine mutations were introduced into TMS 10 of SecY to investigate possible contacts with TMS 3 of SecE as suggested by the synthetic lethality of combined prlA andprlG mutants (15Flower A.M. Osborne R.S. Silhavy T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The previously constructed SecE mutants (L95C to T101C) (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were located at the cytosolic side of TMS 3. The new set of eight consecutive mutations (L406C to I413C) of SecY covers at least two turns of the putative α-helical structure of TMS 10. Sequence alignment and hydrophobicity analysis predict the same depth in the membrane as for the SecE mutants (Fig.1). The single cysteine SecY mutations were placed into a cysteine-less SecYEG expression vector (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the mutant SecYEG complexes were overproduced in E. colistrain SF100. IMVs derived from these cells were analyzed for the SecY and SecE expression levels and proOmpA translocation activity. Thein vitro translocation assay monitoring the protease protection of the translocated proOmpA was performed as described (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) except that fluorescein maleimide-proOmpA was used instead of125I-proOmpA,2 and visualization of the fluorescent bands in the gel after SDS-PAGE was done with a fluorescence imager. Cysteine-less SecYEG was used as the control because it is indistinguishable from wild-type SecYEG (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The expression level of the SecYEG mutants as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining were found to be similar to that of the overexpressed cysteine-less SecYEG complex with one exception. IMVs harboring mutant SecY(I408C)EG showed a lower expression of SecY but not of SecE (data not shown) and a correspondingly lower translocation activity (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 suggests a slightly lower activity for mutant Y(V411C)EG. However, this is not representative for SecY(V411C)EG as repeated experiments show a translocation activity for the mutant that is similar to wild-type SecYEG (data not shown). The cysteine mutations did not produce a strong prl phenotype as none of the mutants supported the translocation of Δ8-proOmpA, a preprotein with a defective signal sequence that is translocated by PrlA4 (Refs. 28van der Wolk J.P.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and data not shown), nor did they reveal a significantly higher proOmpA translocation activity (Fig. 2). To identify possible sites of contact between SecY and SecE, 56 pairs of cysteine mutations were constructed of combinations in TMS 10 of SecY (at positions 406–413) and TMS 3 of SecE (at positions 95–101). The overexpression level and activity of the SecYEG complexes, which contain the SecE cysteine mutations that are used in this study, have been analyzed before and shown to be similar to wild-type SecYEG (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SecYEG IMVs of 49 pairs of cysteine mutations exhibited normal levels of overexpression whereas the 7 combinations with SecY I408C showed a lower SecY expression level (data not shown). IMVs, corrected for the SecY level, were oxidized with 1 mmCu2+(phenanthroline)3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against SecY and SecE (Fig.3). Four cysteine combinations display reproducibly a higher molecular mass band, which reacts with both antibodies against SecY and SecE and corresponds to an expected SecY-SecE cross-link. In particular the combinations SecY(V409C)-SecE(T101C) and SecY(I413C)-SecE(V100C) yielded a strong SecY-SecE cross-link. As shown previously for other identified cross-links (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), oxidation of these cysteine mutant pairs resulted in the inactivation of the protein translocation reaction, whereas the activity was recovered after reduction with dithiothreitol (data not shown). Several other cysteine pairs, especially in combination with SecY I408C, show a faint band at the position of the expected SecY-SecE cross-link (Fig. 3). These bands are significantly weaker than those for the four cysteine pairs mentioned above, did not stain with the SecE antibody, and lacked apparent reproducibility. Therefore, we do not believe that these bands reflect clear contact points between SecY and SecE. The cross-linking data could be modeled by assuming anα-helical contact interface between TMS 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE (Figs. 4 and5).Figure 4Schematic representation of the contact interface between TMS 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE.

TMS 7 and 10 of SecY can be cross-linked to the same residues of SecE. Therefore, the residues involved are colored only according to their strongest contacts (i.e. SecE Val97 in blue; Val100 and Thr101 in yellow). Sites of contact between neighboring SecE molecules are depicted inred patches and connected by red lines. Efficiency of cross-linking is categorized in strong (thick lines) and weak (thin lines).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To incorporate the identified cross-links into a three-dimensional model, TMS 2 (Ala75–Ile92), 7 (Val274–Ala291), and 10 (Val397–Met414) of SecY and TMS 3 (Leu95–Asp112) of SecE were built as α-helices in silico. Strikingly, TMS 7 and 10 of SecY contact the same side of TMS 3 of SecE. However, the position on SecE (Val97) that shows the strongest cross-linking reaction with TMS 7 of SecY is located at a different depth in the membrane than the positions (Val100 and Thr101) that are the strongest contact sites to TMS 10 of SecY. Only one model (Fig. 5) could explain all 13 observed transmembrane contacts (Refs. 17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol.

Remarkably, this model implies a strongly tilted SecE helix surrounded by TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY. We therefore conclude that TMS 3 of SecE is tilted relative to the surrounding transmembrane segments of SecY in the core of the translocase. To fully understand the mechanism of translocation and membrane insertion of proteins, detailed structural information of the translocase is essential. The highest level of structural information can be derived from x-ray crystallography. However, crystallization of membrane proteins is very difficult to accomplish. This is in particular a major challenge with the SecYEG complex as it needs to interact with the soluble SecA protein to form a functional translocase. Recently, two-dimensional crystals of SecYEG have been produced from which a 9-Å projection structure was calculated, but the structural information in this projection of SecYEG is limited as it is not possible to assign the helices at this resolution (21Collinson I.

An alternative approach for obtaining structural information is cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, a technique that can be used to map the sites of contact between the transmembrane segments in membrane proteins. An important advantage of this technique is that structural information is obtained from the functional, membrane-embedded proteins, and observed sites of interaction can be further exploited to obtain information on the dynamics of the proteins involved. We have used this technique to reveal the sites of interaction between SecY and SecE, both essential components of the protein-conducting channel. In this study, we show that TMS 3 of SecE contacts TMS 10 of SecY. Furthermore, we present a three-dimensional model of the SecYE core based on the combined cross-linking data. We have identified multiple sites of contact between SecY and SecE and between two neighboring SecE molecules. Using pairs of cysteine mutations, sites of contact were identified between TMS 3 of SecE and TMS 2 (S105C-I82C; L108C-F78C; L108C-A79C) (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and TMS 7 (V97C-P276C; V100C-A280C; T101C-A280C) (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) of SecY. Here, we show that TMS 3 of SecE also contacts TMS 10 of SecY (V97C-V410C; V97C-I413C; V100C-I413C; T101C-V409C) (Fig. 3). All cross-links reappear periodically, consistent with an α-helical structure of these transmembrane segments (Figs. 4 and 5 A). Oligomeric forms of SecYEG were revealed by covalently linked SecE dimers when cysteines are introduced at the positions of Ala99, Leu106, and Gly110 in TMS 3 (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These contacts also display spatial periodicity, indicating an α-helical interface that covers the entire span of the membrane. Furthermore, the SecE dimer interface is mapped opposite to the SecY-SecE contacts (Fig.5 B). prl mutations in SecY and SecE result in thermally induced destabilization of the SecY-SecE interaction (30Duong F. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3263-3270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The current study shows that the positions of known prlA mutations in TMS 10 are directed away from the SecY-SecE interface (Fig. 4). This phenomenon has also been observed previously for TMS 2 and 7 of SecY (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This implies that the effect on the SecY-SecE interaction caused by prl mutations must be indirect, probably mediated by a local disturbance of the structure or helical packing. The mutation I408C in SecY resulted in lowered expression levels, but the translocation activity was found to be comparable with cysteine-less SecYEG when corrected for the reduced SecY levels (Fig. 2). Ile408 is a hot spot for known prl mutations and thus sensitive to mutational changes. However, I408C did not yield a strong prl phenotype as assayed by translocation of Δ8-proOmpA (data not shown). Strikingly, the suggested contact interfaces of TMS 3 of SecE to TMS 7 and 10 of SecY are overlapping. An effort to fit all observed inner membrane cross-links resulted in the model shown in Fig. 5. For this, TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY and TMS 3 of SecE were modeled as α-helices and arranged such that all identified sites of contact could be accommodated. Extensive modeling and probing of the different contacts resulted in only one model that met the set criteria. Other models could not fit the complete set of identified cross-links or even generate expected sites of contact that were not observed experimentally. Our model revealed a tilted TMS 3 of SecE relative to the surrounding TMS 2, 7, and 10 of SecY. Furthermore, a tilted helix implies a crossed contact interface between two SecYE molecules and the presence of an optimal point of contact because the formation of a SecYE dimer involves TMS 3 of SecE (Fig. 5 B). Indeed, Leu106 of SecE has been observed as an optimal point of contact as the SecE-SecE cross-linking efficiency for the L106C mutation is significantly higher than for the surrounding A99C and G110C (18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32559-32566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We believe that our model is a correct representation of the core of the translocase because: 1) it accommodates all 13 identified inner membrane contacts; 2) periodically re-appearing contacts have been found for every helix-helix interface; and 3) it predicts no additional strong cross-links other than those already observed for the cysteine combinations we have tested. Strikingly, a recent three-dimensional reconstruction of the SecYEG dimer from two-dimensional crystals reveals the presence of two highly tilted helices at the SecYEG contact interface (31Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kuhlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Because SecE has been mapped at this interface, we propose that these helices represent the SecE dimer contact interface (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol.

The dynamics of the identified interactions within the functional translocase have been investigated before (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C.

The formation of thiol-stabilized interactions in the interface between TMS 3 of SecE and TMS 7 of SecY and another TMS 3 of SecE inhibits preprotein translocation reversibly (17Kaufmann A.

These disulfide bonds can, however, also be formed between SecY and SecE (17Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C.

Therefore, transient flexibility and conformational changes within the integral membrane domain of the translocase appear essential for its function. The current data will facilitate future attempts to resolve the structure of the translocase and to study its dynamic nature during preprotein translocation. We would like to thank Jeanine de Keyzer and Jelto Swaving for their help and fruitful discussions and Eli van der Sluis for critically reviewing the manuscript."

Six mutants, F475Y, K480A, K480E, K501A, K501E, and R544A, where the numbers correspond to the pig Na+/K+-ATPase α-chain, were expressed in HeLa cells. The apparent affinities were determined by high affinity ATP-dependent phosphorylation and by the low affinity activation of Na+/K+-ATPase or low affinity ATP inhibition of K+-para-nitrophenylphosphatase (pNPPase). For the mutants K480A and K501A, little affinity change was detected for either the high affinity or the low affinity effect. In contrast, the other four mutants reduced both apparent affinities. Strikingly, R544A had a 30-fold greater effect on the high affinity ATP site than the low affinity site. For the F475Y mutant, it is likely that there was a greater effect on the low affinity site than the high affinity site, but for both F475Y and K480E the affinity for the low affinity ATP effect was reduced so much that it was not possible to estimate a K 0.5. However, both the affinities for the K480E were reduced to ∼1/20. The turnover number of the Na+/K+-ATPase and the apparent affinity for Na+ and pNPP was reduced slightly or not at all for these mutants, but the turnover number of K+-pNPPase and the apparent affinity for K+ were increased. These and other data suggest the presence of only one ATP-binding site, which can change its conformation to accept ATP with a high and low affinity. The requirement of Arg-544 and possibly Lys-501 is more important in forming a high affinity ATP binding conformation, and Phe-475 and possibly Lys-480 are more important in forming the low affinity ATP binding conformation.

Thus it maintains the normal high level of K+ and low level of Na+ inside mammalian cells. This enzyme belongs to the P-type ATPase group that includes gastric H+/K+-ATPase and sarcoplasmic Ca2+/H+-ATPase. The P-type ATPase forms an acid-stable phosphoenzyme (EP)1during ATP hydrolysis (1Glynn I.M. Martonossi A. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes.

It is generally accepted that at least two different ATP-binding sites are present in the P-type ATPase, namely the E 1 and E 2sites. The E 1 form has a high affinity ATP-binding site (K 0.5 is submicromolar) and is a precursor to ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E 1P) formation. The E 2 has a low affinity ATP-binding site (K 0.5 is submillimolar), causing the highV max and playing a regulatory role in accelerating the partial reactions (1Glynn I.M. Martonossi A.

The liberation of the actuator domain allows it to induce closure of the gap between the phosphorylation domain containing a phosphorylatable Asp residue and the nucleotide domain containing residues such as Phe-487, Lys-492, Lys-515, and Arg-560 (Phe-475, Lys-480, Lys-501, and Arg-544 in pig Na/K-ATPase).

However, it has been clearly shown that the high affinity ATP binding to the Na+-bound enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ induced a reversible pyridoxal fluorescence change at position Lys-480 without any ATP-dependent EP formation (10Pedemonte G.H.

The low affinity ATP binding in the presence of Mg2+ + Na+ to the K+-bound enzyme also induced a dynamic pyridoxal fluorescence change at Lys-480 and a fluorescein probe at Lys-501 (15Tsuda T. Kaya S. Yokoyama T. Hayashi Y. Taniguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24339-24345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These data can be explained by assuming that the ATP-binding pocket is sufficiently flexible to accept ATP with a high and low affinity despite the presence of these bulky fluorescence probes that are used to sense high and low affinity ATP binding but completely inhibit ATP-dependent phosphorylation. The other possibility is that another different ATP binding in the same α-chain (19Faller L., D. Kasho V.N. Smirnova I., N. Lin S.-H. Farley R.A. Taniguchi K. Kaya S. Na/K-ATPase and Related ATPases. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 389-396Google Scholar) but not at the ATP-binding pocket (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) induced a conformational change that is detected indirectly by these probes in the ATP-binding pocket. An ATP molecule in the binding pocket appears to be ligated to some of the amino acid side chains exposed to the binding pocket (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar,20Ettrich R. Melichercik M. Teisinger J. Ettrichova O. Krumscheid R. Hofbauerova K. Kvasnicka P. Schoner W. Amler E. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 184-192Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These accumulated data lead us to test, for the first time, whether one single mutation in a side chain exposed to the ATP-binding pocket affects both affinity sites for direct ATP binding with a high and low affinity or whether it affects either affinity site. It is important to understand the relationship between high and low affinity ATP binding for developing a better understanding of the mechanism by which Na+/K+-ATPase operates. To investigate these points, 10 mutants carrying a single amino acid substitution of the side chain that possibly serve as ligands for ATP in the ATP-binding pocket were constructed. To aid the reader in following these experiments, models of the ATP-binding pocket of the wild type and mutants are presented (Scheme I). In this scheme, the three-dimensional structure of the ATP-binding pocket of the wild type and mutants of Na+/K+-ATPase was fitted to Ca2+/H+-ATPase (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) by Swiss-Model (www.expasy.ch/spdbv/). The Phe-475 (green), Lys-480 (orange), Lys-501 (yellow), and Arg-544 (violet) and mutated residues are shown as a space-filling model, where the number of the residues corresponds to the pig Na+/K+-ATPase α-chain. In this study, where a single mutation induced an apparent affinity change in both the high and low affinity ATP effects, Na+, K+, andpNPP were estimated. The data show that each single amino acid substitution, such as F475Y, K480E, K501E, and R544A, reduced the apparent affinity of the high and low affinity ATP effects to different extents. The data suggest that the Arg-544 and possibly Lys-501 are more important for high affinity ATP binding, whereas the Phe-475 and possibly Lys-480 are more important for low affinity ATP binding. This is the first molecular biological approach to show the importance of an exposed amino acid side chain ligated to ATP for the high and low affinity binding in the pocket. In other words, the ATP-binding pocket changes its conformational state to reflect the high and low affinity ATP binding that accompanies ATP hydrolysis. These data are consistent with the oligomeric nature of the enzyme (5Schoner W. Thönges D. Hamer E. Antolovic R. Buxbaum E. Willeke M. Serpersu E.H. Scheiner-Bois G. Bamberg E. Schoner W.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1994: 69-83Google Scholar) using the following antisense oligonucleotide primers: for F475A/F475S/F475E/F475Y, 5′-GGT GGA GTT G(G/T)(A/C) GGG AAT CTC-3′; for K480A/K480E, 5′-GGA GAG CTG GTA C(T/G)C GTT GGT GG-3′; for K501A/K501E, 5′-C TGG GGC GCC C(T/G)C CAT CAC TAG-3′; for R544A/R544E, 5′-CC TAG CAC C(G/T)C CTC TCC AAG-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment including the region encoding amino acid residues 414–515 (between AatII andBamHI sites) or 515–684 (between BamHI andKpnI sites) was subcloned back into the wild type rat Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit cDNA in the pGEM vector. The mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The entire coding region of the mutated rat α1 cDNA was transferred to the expression vector pCDL as described previously (24Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNAs containing a 10:1 molar ratio of pCDL-NaKβ to the pKNH vector (28Fukuda K. Higashida H. Kubo T. Maeda A. Akiba I. Bujo H. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) carrying neomycin-resistant gene by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (29Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar) with an CellPhect Transfection Kit (Amersham Biosciences), selected in 500 μg/ml G418, and several cell lines were isolated. The total RNAs were isolated from each cell lines and treated with DNase I. A pair of PCR primers, 5′-GGA AGA AAT TCA TCT GG-3′ and 5′-GGTCCCATACGTATGAC 3′ corresponding to the nucleotides 494–510 and 1455–1471 of rat β subunit cDNA were designed (24Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These regions were the same DNA sequences found in both the rat and human β subunits (30Kawakami K. Nojima H. Ohta T. Nagano K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2833-284486Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By using the 32P-labeled sense primer, the 978- or 982-bp DNA fragment from rat or human cDNA was amplified and was found to contain three or four recognition sites for restriction enzyme PstI, respectively. After PstI treatment, the 692- or 415-bp DNA fragment derived from rat or human cDNA was radioactive. The ratio of the radioactivity of the 692-bp fragment to that of the 415-bp fragment indicates the expression level of rat Na+/K+-ATPase β subunit to the human one. The selected cell line (A6 cell line; the ratio was 1.23) expressed similar amounts of mRNA for the Na+/K+-ATPase β subunit to that for the endogenous β subunit. HeLa cells expressing the rat β subunit (A6 cell line) were cultured in a 35-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA containing a wild type or mutant Na+/K+-ATPase α1 subunit cDNA with the GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) and subjected to selection in 10 μm ouabain. Ouabain-resistant cells were expanded into stable cell lines. Crude plasma membranes were prepared from HeLa cells (24Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or pig kidney microsomes essentially as described previously (31Hayashi Y. Kimimura M. Homareda H. Matsui H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 482: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Crude plasma membranes at 1 mg/ml were incubated with 0.15 mg/ml of SDS in a buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 5 min at room temperature. The sample was loaded onto stepwise sucrose density gradients consisting of 10 and 40% sucrose layers and centrifuged at 350,000 ×g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min at 4 °C. The fractions at the 10:40% interface were collected and pooled. The pooled sample was diluted with 3 volumes of the sucrose buffer and centrifuged at 350,000 × g in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in the sucrose buffer, and the protein concentration was estimated (32Bradford M Anal. Bochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-treated membrane vesicles (20 μg) were incubated at 0 °C for 10 s in 100 μl of 16 mm NaCl, 0.43 mm MgCl2, 25 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.2, and various concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of an ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution containing 10 mm inorganic phosphate and 1 mm ATP. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid solution by centrifugation. The resulting precipitates were washed with ice-cold water by centrifugation. The precipitates were dissolved in the sample buffer containing a trace amount of a bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and subjected to SDS-PAGE at pH 6.0 (33Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After drying the gels, the radioactivity of 32P incorporated into the Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit was detected and quantitated with a BAS 2000 system (Fuji). In order to correct for losses due to hydrolysis of EP during the above procedure, the SDS-treated Na+/K+-ATPase preparation from pig kidney (20 μg) was incubated under the same conditions as described above. The final precipitates were dissolved in the sample buffer in the absence of bromphenol blue, and half of the aliquots was taken for estimation of the amount of EP by liquid scintillation counting, and the other aliquot (0.75 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitated with a BAS system. The data were analyzed using nonlinear least squares regression (GraphPad Prism; GraphPad Software Inc.) by using the Michaelis-Menten equation:EP (pmol/mg) = EPmax[ATP]/(K 0.5h + [ATP]) in whichEPmax is the maximum amount of EP formed, and K 0.5h is the concentration of ATP giving the half-maximum formation ofEP. The ATPase activity of SDS-treated membrane vesicles from HeLa cells was measured at 37 °C for 30 min in a reaction medium containing 0.5–2 μg of enzyme protein, various concentrations of ATP, 40 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 5 μm or 5 mm ouabain. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 12% SDS. The colorimetric determination of inorganic phosphate with ammonium molybdate complexes was performed (34Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Rat Na+/K+-ATPase activity was determined as the difference between the activities in the presence of 5 μm and 5 mm ouabain. The activity was divided by the amount of EPmax estimated as described above and expressed as s−1. All determinations were performed in duplicate. The data were analyzed in essentially the same manner as described above, where EP andEPmax were, respectively, replaced with ATPase activity (s−1) and V max (the maximum turnover number). Dependence on Na+ or K+ concentration of Na+/K+-ATPase activity was measured with 10 μm or 5 mmouabain at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2, 4 mm ATP, and various concentrations of NaCl or KCl. The data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares regression by using the Hill equation: ATPase activity (s−1) = V max[ion]nH/((K 0.5)nH+ [ion]nH), in which V maxis the maximum activity, n H is the Hill coefficient, and K 0.5 is the concentration of ion giving half-maximum ATPase activity. ThepNPPase activity of the SDS-treated membrane vesicles was measured in duplicate in the presence or absence of 16 mmKCl at 37 °C for 30 min containing 1–2 μg of enzyme protein, various concentrations of pNPP, 6 mmMgCl2, 125 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.2). The K+-pNPPase activity was the difference between the activity with and without KCl. The K+-pNPPase activity was also measured in the presence of 5 mm pNPP and various concentrations of ATP to estimate theK i,0.5 for ATP by nonlinear least squares regression. The 10 expression plasmid vectors (pCDL-NaKs) carrying a single amino acid substitution at Phe-475, Lys-480, Lys-501, or Arg-544, namely F475A/F475S/F475D/F475Y, K480A/K480E, K501A/K501E, and R544A/R544E, were constructed and transfected to HeLa cells expressing the rat Na+/K+-ATPase β subunit. HeLa cells transfected with the six pCDL-NaKs containing rat α1 cDNAs mutated to encode the amino acid substitutions F475Y, K480A/K480E, K501A/K501E, and R544A resulted in the appearance of HeLa cells that survived in a medium containing 10 μm ouabain. This condition permitted cells to be obtained with a higher level of rat Na+/K+-ATPase activity than before (24Imagawa T. Shida M. Matsuzawa K. Kaya S. Taniguchi K. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 76: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) without further steps of cell cloning. Ouabain-resistant cell lines by transfecting with the four pCDL-NaKs encoding the F475A/F475S/F475D or R544E could not be obtained, which suggests that these mutations impaired the Na+/K+-ATPase activity to an extent that the cells did not survive. To estimate the apparent affinity for the high affinity ATP effect, the amount of ATP-dependent EP formation in an SDS-treated enzyme preparation from pig kidney microsomes was measured first in the presence of 0.43 mmMg2+, 2 μm ATP, and 16 mm NaCl (Fig. 1 A, left panel). The amount of EP detected in the membranes increased linearly with increasing amounts of added enzyme protein (not shown). Fig. 1 A (right panel) shows that the phosphorylation of SDS-treated HeLa cell membranes expressing the rat wild type Na+/K+-ATPase was Na+-dependent. The amount of steady stateEP for the SDS-treated membrane of the rat wild type and mutants was measured in the presence of different concentrations of ATP. The data followed Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics (Fig. 1,B and C), which gave the maximum amount of phosphoenzyme (EPmax) and a half-maximum concentration of ATP (K 0.5h). TheK 0.5h of the wild type and the K480A were similar and low in value, a mean value ∼0.026 μm, and that of K480E, K501A, and K501E increased, respectively, to 19-, 2-, and 9-fold. The value of F475Y and R544A increased to 5- and 59-fold (Table I, line a, and Scheme I), respectively.Table IComparison of the relative affinity and activity of mutants with those of wild type enzymeWild typeRelative valuesF475YK480AK480EK501AK501ER544AaK 0.5h (0.026 μm)4.81.0192.08.558.9b K 0.5l (0.69 mm)<5.81.1<5.81.11.62.0c V max/EPmax (241 s−1)1.00.50.50.6dK i,0.5 (0.36 mm)8.41.520.70.96.84.0e K 0.5P (1.9 mm)1.01.61.71.21.42.2fV maxP/EPmax (108 s−1)0.91.40.91.01.22.0gK 0.5Na (7.5 mm)0.80.71.21.11.41.4hK 0.5K (0.67 mm)0.80.90.40.80.50.4iK 0.5K/K 0.5Na(0.089)11.30.30.70.40.3jK 0.5l/K 0.5h (2.7 × 104)<1.21.1<0.30.50.20.03kK i,0.5/K 0.5h (1.3 × 104)1.71.51.10.70.80.07l K 0.5l/K 0.5P(0.36)<6.10.73<3.40.931.20.89mK i,0.5/K 0.5P(0.19)8.90.97120.794.91.8n K 0.5h/K 0.5P(1.4 × 10−5)5.20.66121.86.528Each parameter of the wild type enzyme obtained as described in Figs. 1to 6 was taken as 1.

The values shown in parentheses represent the original parameters obtained. To estimate the apparent affinity for the low affinity ATP effect, Na+/K+-ATPase activities of the rat wild type and mutants were measured with increasing ATP concentrations up to 4 mm in the presence of 40 mm NaCl, 16 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and either 5 μm or 5 mm ouabain. The difference between these activities was assumed to be the Na+/K+-ATPase activity (V) of expressed enzyme. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 2), which gave the half-maximum concentration of ATP (K 0.5l) and theV max as shown as 100%. The turnover number,V max/EPmax, is shown in Fig. 2, where the value of EPmax was obtained in previous section. The activities of the F475Y and K480E were essentially linear in the ATP concentration range studied. Thus the activity in the presence of 4 mm ATP was assumed to be 100% as shown in parentheses. TheK 0.5l of the wild type, K480A, and K501A again showed a similar value, a mean value ∼0.69 mm, and that of K501E and R544A increased ∼2-fold (TableI, line b). The K 0.5l of F475Y and K480E could be estimated as a minimum value, because the activity increased linearly in the presence of 0.1–4 mm ATP. These data suggest that they are greater than 4 mm, up to a ∼6-fold increase. The change in theV max/EPmax is rather small, around a 50% reduction for the case of K501A/K501E and R544A (Table I, line c). It is well"
