https://openalex.org/W1548757996,"The central event in the cellular immune response to invading microorganisms is the specific recognition of foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules by the alphabeta T cell receptor (TCR). The x-ray structure of the complete extracellular fragment of a glycosylated alphabeta TCR was determined at 2.5 angstroms, and its orientation bound to a class I MHC-peptide (pMHC) complex was elucidated from crystals of the TCR-pMHC complex. The TCR resembles an antibody in the variable Valpha and Vbeta domains but deviates in the constant Calpha domain and in the interdomain pairing of Calpha with Cbeta. Four of seven possible asparagine-linked glycosylation sites have ordered carbohydrate moieties, one of which lies in the Calpha-Cbeta interface. The TCR combining site is relatively flat except for a deep hydrophobic cavity between the hypervariable CDR3s (complementarity-determining regions) of the alpha and beta chains. The 2C TCR covers the class I MHC H-2Kb binding groove so that the Valpha CDRs 1 and 2 are positioned over the amino-terminal region of the bound dEV8 peptide, the Vbeta chain CDRs 1 and 2 are over the carboxyl-terminal region of the peptide, and the Valpha and Vbeta CDR3s straddle the peptide between the helices around the central position of the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1985442766,"Members of the BCL2-related family of proteins either promote or repress programmed cell death. BAX, a death-promoting member, heterodimerizes with multiple death-repressing molecules, suggesting that it could prove critical to cell death. We tested whether Bax is required for neuronal death by trophic factor deprivation and during development. Neonatal sympathetic neurons and facial motor neurons from Bax-deficient mice survived nerve growth factor deprivation and disconnection from their targets by axotomy, respectively. These salvaged neurons displayed remarkable soma atrophy and reduced elaboration of neurites; yet they responded to readdition of trophic factor with soma hypertrophy and enhanced neurite outgrowth. Bax-deficient superior cervical ganglia and facial nuclei possessed increased numbers of neurons. Our observations demonstrate that trophic factor deprivation–induced death of sympathetic and motor neurons depends on Bax."

Murine microglia internalize microaggregates of fluorescently labeled or radioiodinated Aβ peptide 1–42. Uptake was confirmed using aggregates of unlabeled Aβ detected by immunofluorescence. Uptake of Aβ was reduced by coincubation with excess acetyl–low density lipoprotein (Ac–LDL) or other scavenger receptor (SR) ligands, and DiI-labeled Ac–LDL uptake by microglia was blocked by excess Aβ. CHO cells transfected with class A or B SRs showed significantly enhanced uptake of Aβ. These results show that microglia express SRs that may play a significant role in the clearance of Aβ plaques. Binding to SRs could activate inflammation responses that contribute to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2078358000,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MAD2 is required for mitotic arrest if the spindle assembly is perturbed. The human homolog of MAD2 was isolated and shown to be a necessary component of the mitotic checkpoint in HeLa cells by antibody electroporation experiments. Human, or Homo sapiens, MAD2 (hsMAD2) was localized at the kinetochore after chromosome condensation but was no longer observed at the kinetochore in metaphase, suggesting that MAD2 might monitor the completeness of the spindle-kinetochore attachment. Finally, T47D, a human breast tumor cell line that is sensitive to taxol and nocodazole, had reduced MAD2 expression and failed to arrest in mitosis after nocodazole treatment. Thus, defects in the mitotic checkpoint may contribute to the sensitivity of certain tumors to mitotic spindle inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2050120618,"Hippocampal organotypic slice cultures maintained 10–20 days in vitro express a high level of the polysialylated embryonic form of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) (PSA–NCAM). Treatment of the cultures with endoneuraminidase-N selectively removed polysialic acid (PSA) from NCAM and completely prevented induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) without affecting cellular or synaptic parameters. Similarly, slices prepared from transgenic mice lacking the NCAM gene exhibited a decaying LTP. No inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor–dependent synaptic responses was detected. Washout of the enzyme resulted in reexpression of PSA immunoreactivity which correlated with a complete recovery of LTP and LTD. This reexpression was blocked by TTX and low calcium and enhanced by bicuculline. Taken together, these results indicate that neuronal activity regulates the expression of PSA–NCAM at the synapse and that this expression is required for the induction of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1988669405,"The CDC13 gene has previously been implicated in the maintenance of telomere integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With the use of two classes of mutations, here it is shown that CDC13 has two discrete roles at the telomere. The cdc13-2est mutation perturbs a function required in vivo for telomerase regulation but not in vitro for enzyme activity, whereas cdc13-1ts defines a separate essential role at the telomere. In vitro, purified Cdc13p binds to single-strand yeast telomeric DNA. Therefore, Cdc13p is a telomere-binding protein required to protect the telomere and mediate access of telomerase to the chromosomal terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2048735610,"The spindle assembly checkpoint delays anaphase until all chromosomes are attached to a mitotic spindle. The mad (mitotic arrest-deficient) and bub (budding uninhibited by benzimidazole) mutants of budding yeast lack this checkpoint and fail to arrest the cell cycle when microtubules are depolymerized. A frog homolog of MAD2 (XMAD2) was isolated and found to play an essential role in the spindle assembly checkpoint in frog egg extracts. XMAD2 protein associated with unattached kinetochores in prometaphase and in nocodazole-treated cells and disappeared from kinetochores at metaphase in untreated cells, suggesting that XMAD2 plays a role in the activation of the checkpoint by unattached kinetochores. This study furthers understanding of the mechanism of cell cycle checkpoints in metazoa and provides a marker for studying the role of the spindle assembly checkpoint in the genetic instability of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2011868306,"To identify genes involved in the patterning of adult structures, Gal4-UAS (upstream activating site) technology was used to visualize patterns of gene expression directly in living flies. A large number of Gal4 insertion lines were generated and their expression patterns were studied. In addition to identifying several characterized developmental genes, the approach revealed previously unsuspected genetic subdivisions of the thorax, which may control the disposition of pattern elements. The boundary between two of these domains coincides with localized expression of the signaling molecule wingless."
https://openalex.org/W2014573698,"Cadherins control critical developmental events through well-documented homophilic interactions. In epithelia, they are hallmark constituents of junctions that mediate intercellular adhesion. Brain tissue expresses several cadherins, and we now show that two of these, neural (N)- and epithelial (E)-cadherin, are localized to synaptic complexes in mutually exclusive distributions. In cerebellum, N-cadherin is frequently found associated with synapses, some of which are perforated, and in hippocampus, N- and E-cadherin-containing synapses are found aligned along dendritic shafts within the stratum lucidum of CA3. We propose that the cadherins function as primary adhesive moieties between pre- and postsynaptic membranes in the synaptic complex. According to this model, once neurites have been guided to the vicinity of their cognate targets, it is the differential distribution of cadherins along the axonal and dendritic plasma membranes, and ultimately cadherin self-association, that ""locks in"" nascent synaptic connections."
https://openalex.org/W1982327997,"P0, the major protein of peripheral nerve myelin, mediates membrane adhesion in the spiral wraps of the myelin sheath. We have determined the crystal structure of the extracellular domain from P0 (P0ex) at 1.9 A resolution. P0ex is folded like a typical immunoglobulin variable-like domain; five residues at the C-terminus are disordered, suggesting a flexible linkage to the membrane. The requirements for crystallization of P0ex are similar to those for maintaining the native extracellular spacing of adjacent myelin lamellae; thus, given the self-adhesive character of P0ex, the crystal itself may reveal some of the natural interactions that occur between P0 molecules in myelin. The structure leads to the suggestion that P0 extracellular domains may emanate from the membrane surface as tetramers that link to tetramers on the opposing membrane surface, to result in the formation of networks of molecules. We report analytical ultracentrifugation data for P0ex that support this idea."
https://openalex.org/W2072254697,"Hereditary demyelinating peripheral neuropathies consist of a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders that includes hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), and congenital hypomyelination (CH). The clinical classification of these neuropathies into discrete categories can sometimes be difficult because there can be both clinical and pathologic variation and overlap between these disorders. We have identified five novel mutations in the myelin protein zero (MPZ) gene, encoding the major structural protein (P0) of peripheral nerve myelin, in patients with either CMT1B, DSS, or CH. This finding suggests that these disorders may not be distinct pathophysiologic entities, but rather represent a spectrum of related ""myelinopathies"" due to an underlying defect in myelination. Furthermore, we hypothesize the differences in clinical severity seen with mutations in MPZ are related to the type of mutation and its subsequent effect on protein function (i.e., loss of function versus dominant negative)."
https://openalex.org/W1972829230,"We have addressed the expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA1 by comparing AMPA and NMDA receptor-(AMPAR- and NMDAR-) mediated postsynaptic signals. We find that potentiation of NMDAR-mediated signals accompanies LTP of AMPAR-mediated signals, and is associated with a change in variability implying an increase in quantal content. Further, tetanic LTP of NMDAR-mediated signals can be elicited when LTP of AMPAR-mediated signals is prevented. We propose that LTP is mainly expressed presynaptically, and that, while AMPARs respond only to glutamate from immediately apposed terminals, NMDARs also sense glutamate released from terminals presynaptic to neighboring cells. We also find that tetanic LTP increases the rate of depression of NMDAR-mediated signals by the use-dependent blocker MK-801, implying an increase in the glutamate release probability. These findings argue for a presynaptic contribution to LTP and for extrasynaptic spill-over of glutamate onto NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W1973627502,"β-Adrenergic receptor activation has a central role in the enhancement of memory formation that occurs during heightened states of emotional arousal. Although β-adrenergic receptor activation may enhance memory formation by modulating long-term potentiation (LTP), a candidate synaptic mechanism involved in memory formation, the cellular basis of this modulation is not fully understood. Here, we report that, in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, β-adrenergic receptor activation selectively enables the induction of LTP during long trains of 5 Hz synaptic stimulation. Protein phosphatase inhibitors mimic the effects of β-adrenergic receptor activation on 5 Hz stimulation–induced LTP, suggesting that activation of noradrenergic systems during emotional arousal may enhance memory formation by inhibiting protein phosphatases that normally oppose the induction of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2024511394,"Caveolae are specialized invaginated cell surface microdomains of undefined function. A cell-free system that reconstituted fission of caveolae from lung endothelial plasma membranes was developed. Addition of cytosol and the hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) induced caveolar fission. The budded caveolae were isolated as vesicles rich in caveolin and the sialoglycolipid GM1 but not glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. These vesicles contained the molecular machinery for endocytosis and transcytosis. In permeabilized endothelial cells, GTP stimulated, whereas GTPgammaS prevented, caveolar budding and endocytosis of the cholera toxin B chain to endosomes. Thus, caveolae may bud to form discrete carrier vesicles that participate in membrane trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2049572658,"The effect of GABAA receptor activation varies from inhibition to excitation depending on the state of the transmembrane anionic concentration gradient (delta anion). delta anion was genetically altered in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons via adenoviral vector-mediated expression of ClC-2, a Cl- channel postulated to regulate the Cl- concentration in neurons in which GABAA receptor activation is predominantly inhibitory. ClC-2 expression was verified by the presence of the appropriate mRNA, protein, and membrane conductance. CIC-2 expression resulted in a large negative shift in the Cl- equilibrium potential (ECl) that attenuated the GABA-mediated membrane depolarization and prevented GABAA receptor-mediated action potentials. These results establish that gene transfer of transmembrane ion channels to neurons can be used to demonstrate their physiological function, and that delta anion can be genetically manipulated to alter the function of neuronal GABAA receptors in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1985909952,"The specification of diverse classes of neurons is critical to the development of the cerebellar cortex. Here, we describe the purification of early embryonic precursors of cerebellar granule neurons from the rhombic lip, the dorsal aspect of the midbrain/hindbrain region. Isolation of rhombic lip cells reveals a homogenous population of precursor cells that express general neuronal markers and the granule cell marker RU49, but fail to extend neurites or express differentiation markers. Differentiation is induced by coculture with external germinal layer (EGL) cells, or their membranes, suggesting that a local inducing factor acts after formation of the EGL. Thus, proliferating precursors within the rhombic lip are specified to be granule cells very early, with the availability of an inducing factor increasing over the course of development."

T lymphocytes from Itk-deficient mice are refractory to mitogenic stimuli delivered through the T cell receptor (TCR). To gain insights into the biochemical role of Itk, the binding properties of the Itk SH3 domain were examined. An optimal Itk SH3 binding motif was derived by screening biased phage display libraries; peptides based on this motif bound with high affinity and selectivity to the Itk SH3 domain. Initial studies with T cell lysates indicated that the Itk SH3 domain bound Cbl, Fyn, and other tyrosine phosphoproteins from TCR-stimulated Jurkat cells. Under conditions of increased detergent stringency Sam 68, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, and hnRNP-K, but not Cbl and Fyn, were bound to the Itk SH3 domain. By examining the ability of different SH3 domains to interact with deletion variants of Sam 68 and WASP, we demonstrated that the Itk-SH3 domain and the SH3 domains of Src family kinases bind to overlapping but distinct sets of proline-rich regions in Sam 68 and WASP.

https://openalex.org/W2013739856,"Neurotransmitters and hormones such as somatostatin, galanin, and adrenalin reduce insulin secretion. Their inhibitory action involves direct interference with the exocytotic machinery. We have examined the molecular processes underlying this effect using high resolution measurements of cell capacitance. Suppression of exocytosis was maximal at concentrations that did not cause complete inhibition of glucose-stimulated electrical activity. This action was dependent on activation of G proteins but was not associated with inhibition of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents or adenylate cyclase activity. The molecular processes initiated by the agonists culminate in the activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, and suppression of the activity of this enzyme abolishes their action on exocytosis. We propose that mechanisms similar to those we report here may contribute to adrenergic and peptidergic inhibition of secretion in other neuroendocrine cells and in nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2071220987,"A mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (ΔEGFR) containing a deletion of 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain is common in human glioblastomas.

Here we demonstrate that the constitutively phosphorylated ΔEGFR enhances growth of glioblastoma cells through increased activity of Ras: 1) there was an increase in the proportion of Ras present in the GTP-bound form, and 2) introduction of neutralizing anti-Ras 259 antibodies into U87MG and U87MG.ΔEGFR cells by microinjection inhibited DNA synthesis to the same low level in both cell populations. We also show that the truncated EGF receptor constitutively associates with the adapter proteins Shc and Grb2 which are involved in the recruitment of Ras to activated receptors. Several derivatives of ΔEGFR containing single, or multiple mutations at critical autophosphorylation sites were constructed and used to demonstrate that the major Shc binding site is Tyr-1148, and that Grb2 association occurs primarily through Tyr-1068.

Br. Med. Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In glioblastoma, deletions in the EGF receptor gene are also found at high frequency. The most common deletion involves exons 2 through 7 and occurs in about 10-20% of these tumors. The potential importance of this deleted receptor is underscored by its recent detection in tumors of the breast and lung (2Ekstrand A.J. Sugawa N. James C.D. Collins V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus, it appears that overexpression of an EGF receptor which cannot bind its ligand is advantageous to tumor growth. We (6Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K.

Thus, it would appear that either a small number of receptors become fully phosphorylated, or that a large number of receptors are phosphorylated, but at low stoichiometry. In any case, this constitutive phosphorylation is associated with the ability of the mutant receptor to confer sustained enhancement of the tumorigenic capacity of U87MG glioblastoma cells (6Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).A great deal of progress has been made recently in understanding the mechanisms by which tyrosine kinase receptors signal. Following ligand binding, receptors dimerize and become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues which act as docking sites for proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding domains (11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Two such domains have been identified, the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain and the PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding domain) (12Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) also termed the phosphotyrosine interaction domain (13Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Many proteins which interact with the EGF receptor contain SH2 domains including Shc, Grb2, phospholipase C-γ, GAP, STAT 1α, STAT 3, and phophotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2. The Shc adapter protein also contains a PTB which appears to be responsible for its major interaction at tyrosine 1148 (14Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Shc and Grb2 have been shown to be important for recruitment of Ras to activated receptors. Grb2 can bind directly to phosphotyrosines present in the consensus sequence YLN or indirectly through phosphorylated Shc (15Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A.

Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). One of the SH3 domains of Grb2 associates with the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, Sos (17Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 18Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), thereby promoting increased Ras activation which initiates a cascade of activation of serine/threonine kinases and ultimately to an increase in gene transcription in the nucleus.Since Ras is a key component of mitogenic signaling pathways, we sought to determine whether it is responsible for the increased tumorigenicity of U87MG.ΔEGFR cells. Here we demonstrate by measurement of the concentration of GTP-bound Ras, that it is indeed activated in the U87MG.ΔEGFR cells relative to the parental U87MG cells. Moreover, inhibition of Ras function by microinjection of a neutralizing antibody into U87MG and U87MG.ΔEGFR cells reduces DNA synthesis to the same low background level suggesting that Ras plays a role in the increased replication of cells expressing the ΔEGFR. We also demonstrate that both Grb2 and Shc constitutively interact with the phosphorylated ΔEGF receptor expressed in U87MG.ΔEGFR cells, in a similar manner to wild-type EGF receptor, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the activation of Ras. Together these results suggest that Shc, Grb2, and Ras are involved in the enhanced mitogenesis and tumor forming potential of cells expressing the ΔEGF receptor.DISCUSSIONThe first transforming mutant EGFR to be identified was the product of the avian erythroblastosis virus v-erbB gene which encodes an EGFR with N- and C-terminal truncations as well as point mutations. Removal of the extracellular domain of EGFR has been shown to result in a weak but constitutive oncogenic activation of the receptor, while ligand binding to the full-length receptor results in a much stronger, EGF-dependent activation (28Khazaie K. Dull T.J. Graf T. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Beug H. Vennstrom B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3061-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, the v-erbB, which encodes an EGF receptor displays much weaker tyrosine kinase activity than that of ligand activated wild-type receptor. A mutation involving deletion of 801 base pairs of the EGFR gene encoding a portion of the extracellular domain has been observed in human tumors of the brain, breast, and lung (2Ekstrand A.J.

This mutant receptor displays low level ligand independent phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells, NR6, Chinese hamster ovary, or U87MG glioblastoma cells. We have used the U87MG cell line as the host for the expression of the mutant receptor since the ΔEGFR mutation spontaneously occurs in this type of cell in vivo. Expression of ΔEGFR in these cells promotes tumor formation in mouse brain (6Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and results in increased DNA synthesis of serum-starved cells. Here we have investigated the possible signaling pathways which may contribute to the increased tumorigenic properties of cells expressing the truncated EGFR.Recent studies have pointed to a key role for Ras in signaling pathways downstream of most receptors including tyrosine kinases, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors (29Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Moreover, it appears that the adapter proteins Shc and/or Grb2 are almost universally involved in the initial recruitment of the exchange factor for Ras to activated receptors. It was therefore the objective of this study to determine whether these key elements of the normal EGFR signaling pathway played a role in the enhanced DNA synthesis and tumorigenesis in U87MG cells overexpressing the ΔEGFR.U87MG.ΔEGFR cells were shown to possess an approximately 2-fold increase in the proportion of Ras in its active GTP-bound form relative to the parental U87MG cells. Under the starvation conditions described these cells also showed a 2-fold increase in DNA synthesis which could be abolished by the introduction of an inhibitory Ras antibody into the cells. These data illustrate that the enhanced growth of U87MG.ΔEGFR cells is dependent on Ras activity. This is supported by a recent study in which expression of the ΔEGFR in NIH 3T3 cells was shown to promote modest activation of elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (30Montgomery R.B. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. Cooper J.A. Stahl W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30562-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Whether this activation of the Ras pathway is primarily responsible for enhanced tumorigenesis remains to be determined.We have also demonstrated that the truncated receptor behaves like the full-length wild-type receptor with respect to its interaction with Shc and Grb2, and binds to both in an unregulated, ligand-independent fashion when expressed in U87MG cells. The major sites of phosphorylation were tyrosines 1068, 1148, and 1173, as has been shown for the full-length receptor. A low level of phosphorylation of a mutant receptor containing only sites Tyr-992 and Tyr-1086 was detectable by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting if the receptor was first precipitated with an anti-EGFR antibody; however, a similar low level of phosphorylation was also detectable on a receptor lacking all five of the major phosphorylation sites. Grb2 only bound appreciably to constructs containing intact Tyr-1068, and Shc only bound efficiently in cells to those with intact Tyr-1148, although a small amount bound to a mutant with only intact Tyr-1173, consistent with findings for the full-length receptor (14Okabayashi Y.

Tyr-1148 is contained within an NPXY motif which has been demonstrated to be the consensus required for the Shc-PTB (12Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T.

Tyr-1173 is contained within the motif NAXYLRV which contains an imperfect NAXY binding motif for the PTB, and a motif which binds the Shc-SH2 domain (Y-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic) (34Songyang Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine. Given association data in cells, it would appear that the primary interaction site is through Tyr-1148, however, binding of the Shc-PTB to Tyr-1148 could promote a secondary binding to the same or adjacent receptor through its SH2 domain. Interestingly, U87MG cells expressing the DY1 mutant (which only lacks Tyr-1173) form tumors in animals at a similar rate to the parental cell line, suggesting that interactions with this site are essential for promoting tumor growth. 3H.-J. Su Huang, M. Nagane, C. K. Klingbeil, H. Lin, R. Nishikawa, X.-D. Ji, C.-M. Haung, G.-N. Gill, H. S. Wiley, and W. K. Cavenee, unpublished data. One such interaction might be with the Shc-SH2 domain since the DY1 mutant is incapable of binding to Shc-SH2 as we have demonstrated in vitro. A mutant which only contains Tyr-1173 (DY4) also has impaired tumor promoting properties, suggesting that this site is required in addition to others to provide interactions necessary to provide a growth advantage. Thus binding of Shc through both SH2 and PTB may be necessary in order to promote associations which are necessary for DNA synthesis or tumorigenesis, which may not represent the same phenomenon. In support of this notion, microinjection of the Shc-SH2 domain into NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing full-length EGFR suppressed EGF-induced DNA synthesis indicating that interactions with this domain as well as with the PTB are important for mitogenesis (35Gotoh N. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Chida K. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2525-2533PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps a binding site for a novel protein remains buried unless the PTB and SH2 domains are occupied. A number of proteins have been shown to associate with Shc in response to various stimuli, in addition to Grb2 (36Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar, 37Pronk G.J. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Pawson T. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5748-5753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Basu T.

Alternatively, Shc could be involved in bridging two adjacent receptors. This may be of more importance to truncated receptors than full-length receptors which dimerize inefficiently in the absence of a ligand binding domain. In the case of the full-length EGFR it has been reported that elimination of individual phosphorylation sites did not significantly affect the kinase activity or mitogenic properties of the receptor (8Livneh E.

Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy may be explained by ability of the full-length receptor to heterodimerize and signal through related receptors.The observation that mutant receptors lacking all Shc-binding sites were able to phosphorylate Shc to some extent is also noteworthy. This phenomenon has also been observed for full-length EGFR and c-erbB-2 species lacking phosphorylation sites (42Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar, 43Soler C. Alvarez C.V. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2207-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ricci A. Lanfrancone L. Chiari R. Belardo G.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Shc phosphorylation was greater, and therefore more efficient for those mutants which were still able to bind Shc. It is possible that the large number of truncated receptors on the surface of the cell simply encounter Shc molecules bound to lipids on the inside of the membrane and phosphorylate these at low frequency. In all cases where Shc was phosphorylated it also bound Grb2 creating complexes which could presumably signal to Ras, albeit the localization of the active complexes was not determined. The majority of Grb2 associated with the receptor, however, appeared to be bound directly to Tyr-1068 since DY1 appeared to bind almost as much Grb2 as the ΔEGFR, but DY2 did not bind as efficiently. Thus, it is possible that the Shc bound to Tyr-1148 and −1173 is eliciting additional interactions which may not involve Grb2 and may or may not be upstream of Ras.One key question which remains to be determined is why the mutant EGF receptors are selected for loss of this specific portion of the extracellular domain. One possibility may lie in the observation that truncation results in a modest increase in autophosphorylation relative to the full-length receptor, this phosphorylation occurring at the same major sites, enabling the truncated receptor to form the same interactions as the wild-type receptor. Whether or not this explains why the removal of the ligand-binding domain should provide such a significant growth advantage is yet unclear. Our recent work suggests that a deficiency in internalization may also be an important feature of the growth stimulatory activity of this mutant receptor.3 Signalling from the wild-type receptor is initiated by EGF binding and the response is complex, being regulated by protein kinase C, internalization, and dephosphorylation. In addition, full-length receptors can heterodimerize with other family members which could potentially sustain a differentiation response and not promote cell division (46Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain may also interact with other surface molecules on adjacent cells such as heparin-binding EGF which could reduce the invasiveness of the cells (47Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Perhaps the elimination of the EGF binding element eliminates potential effectors from the repertoire of the truncated receptor leaving those which are of advantage for cell division. INTRODUCTIONThe EGF 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorBrdUrd5-bromodeoxyuridineTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinePTBphosphotyrosine-binding domainGSTglutathione S-transferase. receptor family of tyrosine kinases has been implicated in a wide variety of human tumors, where they are typically overexpressed by gene amplification or increased transcription (1Gullick W.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In glioblastoma, deletions in the EGF receptor gene are also found at high frequency. The most common deletion involves exons 2 through 7 and occurs in about 10-20% of these tumors. The potential importance of this deleted receptor is underscored by its recent detection in tumors of the breast and lung (2Ekstrand A.J. Sugawa N. James C.D. Collins V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Thus, it appears that overexpression of an EGF receptor which cannot bind its ligand is advantageous to tumor growth. We (6Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K.

Thus, it would appear that either a small number of receptors become fully phosphorylated, or that a large number of receptors are phosphorylated, but at low stoichiometry. In any case, this constitutive phosphorylation is associated with the ability of the mutant receptor to confer sustained enhancement of the tumorigenic capacity of U87MG glioblastoma cells (6Nishikawa R. Ji X.D. Harmon R.C. Lazar C.S. Gill G.N. Cavenee W.K. Huang H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar).A great deal of progress has been made recently in understanding the mechanisms by which tyrosine kinase receptors signal. Following ligand binding, receptors dimerize and become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues which act as docking sites for proteins containing phosphotyrosine binding domains (11Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Two such domains have been identified, the SH2 (Src homology 2) domain and the PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding domain) (12Kavanaugh W.M. Turck C.W. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 1177-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) also termed the phosphotyrosine interaction domain (13Bork P. Margolis B. Cell. 1995; 80: 693-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Many proteins which interact with the EGF receptor contain SH2 domains including Shc, Grb2, phospholipase C-γ, GAP, STAT 1α, STAT 3, and phophotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2. The Shc adapter protein also contains a PTB which appears to be responsible for its major interaction at tyrosine 1148 (14Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both Shc and Grb2 have been shown to be important for recruitment of Ras to activated receptors. Grb2 can bind directly to phosphotyrosines present in the consensus sequence YLN or indirectly through phosphorylated Shc (15Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A.

Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). One of the SH3 domains of Grb2 associates with the nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, Sos (17Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 18Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), thereby promoting increased Ras activation which initiates a cascade of activation of serine/threonine kinases and ultimately to an increase in gene transcription in the nucleus.Since Ras is a key component of mitogenic signaling pathways, we sought to determine whether it is responsible for the increased tumorigenicity of U87MG.ΔEGFR cells. Here we demonstrate by measurement of the concentration of GTP-bound Ras, that it is indeed activated in the U87MG.ΔEGFR cells relative to the parental U87MG cells. Moreover, inhibition of Ras function by microinjection of a neutralizing antibody into U87MG and U87MG.ΔEGFR cells reduces DNA synthesis to the same low background level suggesting that Ras plays a role in the increased replication of cells expressing the ΔEGFR. We also demonstrate that both Grb2 and Shc constitutively interact with the phosphorylated ΔEGF receptor expressed in U87MG.ΔEGFR cells, in a similar manner to wild-type EGF receptor, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the activation of Ras. Together these results suggest that Shc, Grb2, and Ras are involved in the enhanced mitogenesis and tumor forming potential of cells expressing the ΔEGF receptor."

This exocytosis was transient in nature, decaying with a time constant of approximately 30 ms. The decay could not be explained by a decline in presynaptic Ca2+ concentration, depletion of synaptic vesicles, or desensitization of postsynaptic receptors. Experiments in which Ca2+ was increased either in a series of steps or continuously at different rates suggested that the decay is caused by adaptation of the exocytotic Ca2+ receptor to higher levels of Ca2+. This adjustable sensitivity to Ca2+ represents a novel property of the triggering mechanism that can be used to evaluate molecular models of exocytosis. Adaptation can limit the amount of transmitter released by a nerve terminal and permit the speed of a presynaptic Ca2+ rise to serve as a critical determinant of synaptic efficacy."

INTRODUCTIONHormones and neurotransmitters control the levels of the intracellular second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, by regulating the activity of cyclases and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 1The abbreviations used are: PDEphosphodiesteraseCaM-PDEcalmodulin-dependent phosphodiesteraseORFopen reading frameKmMichaelis constantUTRuntranslated regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. At least seven different families of PDE are currently recognized (1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 2Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Most families contain several distinct genes, and many of these genes encode multiple alternative splice variants in a tissue-specific manner. The facts that different PDEs have unique sequences in their catalytic and/or regulatory domains and that they are often selectively expressed in a limited number of cell types allow cell-specific regulation of cyclic nucleotide level by the PDEs. They also provides a basis for selective therapeutic intervention.The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PDEs (CaM-PDEs) compose one of the best known of the multiple PDE families. All CaM-PDEs are activated by calmodulin in the presence of calcium. It is thought that CaM-PDEs act as mediators between the Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotide second messenger systems that allow cyclic nucleotide-dependent processes to be regulated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (2Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). A rather large family of CaM-PDE isozymes is expressed in mammals. At least six different members, including 59-, 61-, 63-, 68-, and 75-kDa as well as olfactory-enriched forms, have been described (3Novack J.P. Charbonneau H. Bentley J.K. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A.

PDE1C is a newly identified CaM-PDE gene, and one of its products (PDE1C2) is a dominant form of CaM-PDE present in olfactory sensory neurons (14Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The genes encoding the brain 75-kDa and testis 68-kDa CaM-PDEs have not been identified.We report here the isolation and characterization of three new splice variants of the PDE1C gene from a mouse brain library, which we call PDE1C1, PDE1C4, and PDE1C5. The protein sequences deduced from PDE1C1, PDE1C4, and PDE1C5 cDNAs are the same except in the C-terminal regions. However, they differ from the PDE1C2 protein sequence at both the N and C termini. More interestingly, PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 cDNAs have the same coding sequences but different 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs), which is the first example of alternative splicing occurring solely in the 3′-UTR for mammalian PDEs. In order to understand the functional consequences of the different sequences among these variants, the kinetic properties, Ca2+ activation characteristics, inhibition by various CaM-PDE inhibitors, reciprocal inhibition between substrates, and the tissue-specific expression of multiple CaM-PDEs were systematically investigated. The data should help us understand the biological reasons for this great diversity and may provide a molecular basis for the design of selective inhibitors or activators of this PDE family.DISCUSSIONWe report here the isolation and characterization of three new mouse PDE1C cDNA clones named PDE1C1, PDE1C4, and PDE1C5. Taken together with other recent data, it now appears that alternative splicing of the PDE1C gene generates at least five distinct mRNAs: PDE1C1, PDE1C2 (14Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), PDE1C3 (26Loughney K. Martins T. Sonnenburg B. Beavo J. Ferguson K. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 469Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), PDE1C4, and PDE1C5. Analysis of the genomic sequence of the PDE1C gene will be required to reveal the detailed mechanisms for generating these multiple species of PDE1C mRNA.PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 share the same N terminus, which is different from that of PDE1C2. The divergence point is located within the first calmodulin binding domain identified in PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 (3Novack J.P. Charbonneau H. Bentley J.K. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 4Charbonneau H. Kumar S. Novack J.P. Blumenthal D.K. Griffin P.R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Beavo J.A. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and at a very similar relative position to the alternative splicing site that yields PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 (Fig. 1C). Similar to the differences in Ca2+ sensitivity between PDE1A1 and PDE1A2, PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 have much lower Ca2+ sensitivity than PDE1C2 (Fig. 3). This result further supports the idea that the N terminus of the CaM-PDE is the region where Ca2+/calmodulin binds. In addition, this PDE1C example and the PDE1A example strongly suggest that the functional differences (e.g. Ca2+ activation) among CaM-PDE isozymes can be attributed to their structural diversity and that alternative splicing provides an additional mechanism for increases in functional and structural diversity.PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 cDNAs differ only in their 3′-UTRs and thus encode the same protein. PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 have the same N termini and different C termini. The kinetic properties and Ca2+ sensitivity of these enzymes with different C termini are very similar, suggesting that the C-terminal sequences are not important for the enzyme's catalytic activity nor the interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin. But it is not yet known whether these different C-terminal sequences have any consequences for stability, intracellular localization, regulatory modification, or cell-specific expression. The PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 cDNAs appear to be generated by alternative splicing of 3′-UTRs. Much experimental evidence indicates that sequences in 3′-UTRs critically influence post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs during growth, differentiation, and response to environmental stimuli (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 28Brawerman G. Cell. 1987; 48: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Jackson R.J.

Hence, the functional role for the alternatively spliced 3′-UTRs of PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 may be in post-transcriptional, translational, and/or tissue-specific regulation of the gene expression. Clearly, more work is required to define the functional role for the unique sequences found in the different splice variants.Although a number of compounds are capable of inhibiting the CaM-PDEs, most of them lack selectivity between CaM-PDE isozymes. The three compounds tested in this study showed some selectivity between CaM-PDE isozymes and even between splice variants. The fact that these three compounds have different selectivity profiles may reflect different mechanisms of inhibition. Availability of such selective inhibitors should not only provide useful tools for understanding biological function of each isozyme but also offer an initial starting point for development of agents having higher selectivity.CaM-PDEs with high affinities for both cAMP and cGMP have been described in various tissues, such as olfactory epithelium (8Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), testis (6Rossi P. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heart (31Reeves M.L. Leigh B.K. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and pancreas (32Vandermeers A. Vandermeers P.M.C. Rathe J. Christophe J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PDE1C2 is likely to represent the high affinity CaM-PDE activity in olfactory epithelium (8Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper help to define which gene products are responsible for some of the high affinity CaM-PDE activities described in previous studies. A mouse testis enriched 68-70-kDa CaM-PDE that exhibits micromolar affinity for both cAMP and cGMP has been purified 900-fold and characterized previously (6Rossi P. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data show that PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 isozymes are highly expressed in the mouse testis and have high affinities to both cAMP and cGMP as well as molecular masses close to 70 kDa. These features suggest that it is very likely that some combination of these PDE1C isozymes represents the high affinity cAMP hydrolytic activity seen in the testis CaM-PDE preparation. However, two differences in biochemical parameters did not seem consistent with this conclusion. First, the purified testis enzyme is suggested to have two distinct catalytic sites, because each of the two substrates, cAMP and cGMP, acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the other. However, the PDE1C isozymes expressed in this study appear to have only one catalytic site for both substrates (Fig. 4). Second, the purified testis enzyme showed both high and low affinity kinetic components for both cAMP and cGMP. However, the expressed PDE1C isozymes have only the high affinity component. It seems likely that the apparent discrepancy between the expressed PDE1C activity in this study and the previously reported testis enzyme could be best explained by the assumption that the testis enzyme preparation used in the early studies may have contained more than one CaM-PDE, at least one of which has a lower affinity for cAMP and cGMP.High levels of specific PDE isozyme expression are often associated with specific functions of the region, such as the cGMP-specific PDE for visual transduction cascade in the retina (33Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and the cGMP-stimulated PDE for the aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex (34MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, in cytosolic fractions of purified synaptosomes, the breakdown of cGMP was found to be highly stimulated by Ca2+ (35Mayer B. Klatt P. Bohme E. Schmidt K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that a CaM-PDE is likely to be involved in preventing elevations of intracellular cGMP levels in activated, nitric oxide-producing granule cells (35Mayer B. Klatt P. Bohme E. Schmidt K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It seems likely that this CaM-PDE activity may be contributed by PDE1C1 and PDE1C5. The fact that PDE1C1 and PDE1C5 represent the major CaM-PDE activities in granule cells of cerebellum suggests an important role for these PDEs in this down-regulation of cGMP of granule cells seen in response to excitatory amino acid stimulation. Primary cultured cerebellar granule cells exhibiting a high level of PDE1C activity should be a good system for further study of the physiological function of PDE1C in the granule cells.At least three CaM-PDE genes and alternative RNA processing pathways generate an unexpectedly large diversity of CaM-PDEs. More than one CaM-PDE or different splice variants are often expressed in the same tissue or even in the same cell types. Therefore, the kinetic constants or the results of inhibitor analysis determined by using biochemically purified enzymes from many tissues are often complicated by the contamination of one or more closely related enzymes. Our efforts in molecular cloning and expression of individual CaM-PDE have allowed us to define the kinetic characteristics of single isoforms. In addition, it is likely that the identification and characterization of the new PDE1C splice variants reported here and previously will aid in understanding the functional consequences resulting from unique CaM-PDE expression as well as provide molecular basis for the development of isozyme-selective CaM-PDE inhibitors. INTRODUCTIONHormones and neurotransmitters control the levels of the intracellular second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, by regulating the activity of cyclases and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). 1The abbreviations used are: PDEphosphodiesteraseCaM-PDEcalmodulin-dependent phosphodiesteraseORFopen reading frameKmMichaelis constantUTRuntranslated regionPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. At least seven different families of PDE are currently recognized (1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar, 2Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Most families contain several distinct genes, and many of these genes encode multiple alternative splice variants in a tissue-specific manner. The facts that different PDEs have unique sequences in their catalytic and/or regulatory domains and that they are often selectively expressed in a limited number of cell types allow cell-specific regulation of cyclic nucleotide level by the PDEs. They also provides a basis for selective therapeutic intervention.The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PDEs (CaM-PDEs) compose one of the best known of the multiple PDE families. All CaM-PDEs are activated by calmodulin in the presence of calcium. It is thought that CaM-PDEs act as mediators between the Ca2+ and cyclic nucleotide second messenger systems that allow cyclic nucleotide-dependent processes to be regulated by increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration (2Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). A rather large family of CaM-PDE isozymes is expressed in mammals. At least six different members, including 59-, 61-, 63-, 68-, and 75-kDa as well as olfactory-enriched forms, have been described (3Novack J.P. Charbonneau H. Bentley J.K. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These CaM-PDE isozymes are expressed in distinct cell types in various tissues and have different substrate specificities, specific activities, and activation characteristics by Ca2+ and CaM (9Beavo, J., Houslay, M. D., (eds) (1990) Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases: Structure, Function, Regulation, and Drug Action, Vol 2, p. 19, John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom.Google Scholar). To date, three different genes (PDE1A, PDE1B, and PDE1C) have been identified in the CaM-PDE family. PDE1A and PDE1B have been extensively characterized (5Bentley J.K. Kadlecek A. Sherbert C.H.

Two splice variants of the PDE1A gene, PDE1A1 and PDE1A2, have been isolated from bovine heart and brain, respectively (10Sonnenburg W.K. Seger D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol.

Beavo J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7940-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). PDE1B1, which encodes the bovine brain 63-kDa CaM-PDE isozyme, has only one mRNA product isolated so far (5Bentley J.K. Kadlecek A. Sherbert C.H. Seger D. Sonnenburg W.K. Charbonneau H. Novack J.P.

DISCUSSIONWe report here the isolation and characterization of three new mouse PDE1C cDNA clones named PDE1C1, PDE1C4, and PDE1C5.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and at a very similar relative position to the alternative splicing site that yields PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 (Fig. 1C). Similar to the differences in Ca2+ sensitivity between PDE1A1 and PDE1A2, PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 have much lower Ca2+ sensitivity than PDE1C2 (Fig. 3). This result further supports the idea that the N terminus of the CaM-PDE is the region where Ca2+/calmodulin binds. In addition, this PDE1C example and the PDE1A example strongly suggest that the functional differences (e.g. Ca2+ activation) among CaM-PDE isozymes can be attributed to their structural diversity and that alternative splicing provides an additional mechanism for increases in functional and structural diversity.PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 cDNAs differ only in their 3′-UTRs and thus encode the same protein. PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 have the same N termini and different C termini. The kinetic properties and Ca2+ sensitivity of these enzymes with different C termini are very similar, suggesting that the C-terminal sequences are not important for the enzyme's catalytic activity nor the interaction with Ca2+/calmodulin. But it is not yet known whether these different C-terminal sequences have any consequences for stability, intracellular localization, regulatory modification, or cell-specific expression. The PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 cDNAs appear to be generated by alternative splicing of 3′-UTRs. Much experimental evidence indicates that sequences in 3′-UTRs critically influence post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs during growth, differentiation, and response to environmental stimuli (27Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3107) Google Scholar, 28Brawerman G. Cell. 1987; 48: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 29Jackson R.J.

Hence, the functional role for the alternatively spliced 3′-UTRs of PDE1C4 and PDE1C5 may be in post-transcriptional, translational, and/or tissue-specific regulation of the gene expression. Clearly, more work is required to define the functional role for the unique sequences found in the different splice variants.Although a number of compounds are capable of inhibiting the CaM-PDEs, most of them lack selectivity between CaM-PDE isozymes. The three compounds tested in this study showed some selectivity between CaM-PDE isozymes and even between splice variants. The fact that these three compounds have different selectivity profiles may reflect different mechanisms of inhibition. Availability of such selective inhibitors should not only provide useful tools for understanding biological function of each isozyme but also offer an initial starting point for development of agents having higher selectivity.CaM-PDEs with high affinities for both cAMP and cGMP have been described in various tissues, such as olfactory epithelium (8Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), testis (6Rossi P. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heart (31Reeves M.L. Leigh B.K. England P.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and pancreas (32Vandermeers A. Vandermeers P.M.C. Rathe J. Christophe J. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PDE1C2 is likely to represent the high affinity CaM-PDE activity in olfactory epithelium (8Borisy F.F. Ronnett G.V. Cunningham A.M. Juilfs D. Beavo J. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 915-923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper help to define which gene products are responsible for some of the high affinity CaM-PDE activities described in previous studies. A mouse testis enriched 68-70-kDa CaM-PDE that exhibits micromolar affinity for both cAMP and cGMP has been purified 900-fold and characterized previously (6Rossi P. Giorgi M. Geremia R. Kincaid R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15521-15527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present data show that PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 isozymes are highly expressed in the mouse testis and have high affinities to both cAMP and cGMP as well as molecular masses close to 70 kDa. These features suggest that it is very likely that some combination of these PDE1C isozymes represents the high affinity cAMP hydrolytic activity seen in the testis CaM-PDE preparation. However, two differences in biochemical parameters did not seem consistent with this conclusion. First, the purified testis enzyme is suggested to have two distinct catalytic sites, because each of the two substrates, cAMP and cGMP, acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of the other. However, the PDE1C isozymes expressed in this study appear to have only one catalytic site for both substrates (Fig. 4). Second, the purified testis enzyme showed both high and low affinity kinetic components for both cAMP and cGMP. However, the expressed PDE1C isozymes have only the high affinity component. It seems likely that the apparent discrepancy between the expressed PDE1C activity in this study and the previously reported testis enzyme could be best explained by the assumption that the testis enzyme preparation used in the early studies may have contained more than one CaM-PDE, at least one of which has a lower affinity for cAMP and cGMP.High levels of specific PDE isozyme expression are often associated with specific functions of the region, such as the cGMP-specific PDE for visual transduction cascade in the retina (33Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and the cGMP-stimulated PDE for the aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex (34MacFarland R.T. Zelus B.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, in cytosolic fractions of purified synaptosomes, the breakdown of cGMP was found to be highly stimulated by Ca2+ (35Mayer B. Klatt P. Bohme E. Schmidt K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that a CaM-PDE is likely to be involved in preventing elevations of intracellular cGMP levels in activated, nitric oxide-producing granule cells (35Mayer B. Klatt P. Bohme E. Schmidt K. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2024-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It seems likely that this CaM-PDE activity may be contributed by PDE1C1 and PDE1C5. The fact that PDE1C1 and PDE1C5 represent the major CaM-PDE activities in granule cells of cerebellum suggests an important role for these PDEs in this down-regulation of cGMP of granule cells seen in response to excitatory amino acid stimulation. Primary cultured cerebellar granule cells exhibiting a high level of PDE1C activity should be a good system for further study of the physiological function of PDE1C in the granule cells.At least three CaM-PDE genes and alternative RNA processing pathways generate an unexpectedly large diversity of CaM-PDEs. More than one CaM-PDE or different splice variants are often expressed in the same tissue or even in the same cell types. Therefore, the kinetic constants or the results of inhibitor analysis determined by using biochemically purified enzymes from many tissues are often complicated by the contamination of one or more closely related enzymes. Our efforts in molecular cloning and expression of individual CaM-PDE have allowed us to define the kinetic characteristics of single isoforms. In addition, it is likely that the identification and characterization of the new PDE1C splice variants reported here and previously will aid in understanding the functional consequences resulting from unique CaM-PDE expression as well as provide molecular basis for the development of isozyme-selective CaM-PDE inhibitors. We report here the isolation and characterization of three new mouse PDE1C cDNA clones named PDE1C1, PDE1C4, and PDE1C5. Taken together with other recent data, it now appears that alternative splicing of the PDE1C gene generates at least five distinct mRNAs: PDE1C1, PDE1C2 (14Yan C. Zhao A.Z. Bentley J.K. Loughney K. Ferguson K. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9677-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), PDE1C3 (26Loughney K. Martins T. Sonnenburg B. Beavo J. Ferguson K. FASEB J. 1994; 8 (abstr.): 469Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), PDE1C4, and PDE1C5. Analysis of the genomic sequence of the PDE1C gene will be required to reveal the detailed mechanisms for generating these multiple species of PDE1C mRNA. PDE1C1 and PDE1C4/5 share the same N terminus, which is different from that of PDE1C2. The divergence point is located within the first calmodulin binding domain identified in PDE1A1 and PDE1A2 (3Novack J.P. Charbonneau H. Bentley J.K. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A.

https://openalex.org/W1990043673,"Synthesis of new protein has been shown to be required for establishment of a late phase in hippocampal long-term potentiation. Whether a similar requirement is needed to produce the late phase of long-term depression (LTD) remains to be determined. Application of transcription inhibitors or of the translation inhibitor anisomycin, immediately, but not 30 min after glutamate/depolarization conjunction, attenuated a late phase of cerebellar LTD in culture. LTD, produced in a perforated outside-out macropatch of Purkinje neuron dendrite, which lacks nuclear material, returned to baseline values with a time course paralleling that observed with protein synthesis inhibitors in intact cultured Purkinje neurons. These findings suggest that there is a distinct late phase of cerebellar LTD that is dependent upon postsynaptic protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966039946,"We report here the characterization of the human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) gene. The gene is 83 kilobase pairs (kb) long with exon-intron splicing sites located in preserved positions among the three members of the TIMP family. A 2.6-kb genomic DNA fragment flanking the 5′-end of the gene contains several regulatory elements including five Sp1, two AP-2, one AP-1, and three PEA-3 binding sites. Despite the presence of a complete AP-1 consensus at position −281, the promoter did not respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment. However, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response was generated by insertion of a similar AP-1 consensus at position −71, indicating the importance of the positioning of this motif. The promoter contains a typical CpG island; however, methylation of this island did not seem to influence gene expression. Analysis of the 3′-end of the gene revealed that the two mRNAs for TIMP-2 (1.2 and 3.8 kb) differ by the selection of their polyadenylation signal sites, but selection of these sites does not affect RNA stability. In summary, the TIMP-2 gene has several features observed in housekeeping genes, and differs significantly from TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 genes. These differences are likely to explain the specific roles that these inhibitors play in the regulation of matrix metalloproteinases.

Among this family three groups have been well characterized based on their substrate specificity and include collagenases, gelatinases, and stromelysins (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). These enzymes have been implicated in physiological and pathological conditions associated with breakdown of the ECM such as trophoblastic implantation, embryonic development, angiogenesis, osteoarthritis and tumor invasion (2Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar, 3Matrisian L.M. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). The activity of these proteases in the ECM is regulated by specific inhibitors known as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). So far, the TIMP family consists of three members TIMP-1, −2, and −3, characterized in different species. The human TIMP-1 gene has been localized on the chromosome X (4Willard H.F. Durfy S.J. Mahtani M.M. Dorkins H. Davies K.E. Williams B.R.G. Human Genet. 1989; 81: 235-238Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas the TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 genes have been assigned to chromosome 17 (5DeClerck Y. Szpirer C. Aly M.S. Cassiman J.J. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G. Genomics. 1992; 14: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and 22 (6Apte S.S. Mattei M-G. Olsen B.R.

These inhibitors inhibit the proteolytic activity of activated MMP by forming tight (Ki≤ 10−9M) 1:1 stoichiometric inhibitory complexes with the enzyme (8Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Roswit W.T. Stricklin G.P. Collagen Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the three TIMP genes share a common inhibitory activity for all members of the MMP family, there is experimental evidence indicating that they have specific functions. For example, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 form preferential complexes with pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2, respectively (9Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 have been shown to promote the growth of erythroid precursor cells as well as of a variety of normal and malignant cells, suggesting a bifunctional role for these inhibitors (12Docherty A.J.P.

Additional evidence supporting specific roles for these three inhibitors in vivo has been provided by experiments showing their differential expression in cells and in tissues and during development. For example, in adult mice, TIMP-1 is preferentially expressed in epithelial tissues, in cartilage, and in muscles (15Flenniken A.M. Williams B.R.G. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); and during murine embryonic development, TIMP-1 is specifically expressed in developing bone, whereas TIMP-3 is preferentially found in developing epithelia, cartilage, and muscles (16Apte S.S.

TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 are up-regulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and TGF-β, whereas TIMP-2 is down-regulated by both agents (10Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Onisto M. Levy A.T.

Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and TIMP-3 (7Wick M. Haronen R. Mumberg D. Burger C. Olsen B.R. Budarf M.L. Apte S.S. Mueller R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) promoters have only been partially characterized. Altogether, these observations suggest that each individual member of the TIMP family has a specific physiological function. These observations led us to examine the molecular basis for some of these differences, by characterizing the human TIMP-2 (hTIMP-2) gene. In this report, we provide evidence supporting a major role of this inhibitor in providing a stable basal level of inhibitory activity in tissues. A human TIMP-2 cDNA probe containing the full (1,035-nt) sequence (24Boone T.C. Johnson M.J. DeClerck Y.A. Langley K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2800-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was used to screen a human placenta library prepared in the cosmid pWE 15 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a human chromosome 17 library in the cosmid SuperCos I vector (originally provided by Dr. Larry Deaven at Los Alamos National Laboratory). The human chromosome 17 library was screened by hybridization to duplicate high density clone arrays on nylon filters as described elsewhere (25Couch F.J. Castilla L.H. Xu J. Abel K.J. Welcsh P. King S.E. Wong L. Ho P.P. Merajver S. Brody L.C. Yin G. Hayes S.T. Gieser L.M. Flejter W.L. Glover T.W. Friedman L.S. Lynch E.D. Meza J.E. King M-C. Law D.J. Deaven L. Bowcock A.M. Collins F.S. Weber B.L. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Genomics. 1995; 25: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the human placenta library, a total of 3.6 × 106 colony forming units were plated on nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Corp.) placed on 20 150-mm Luria Bertani broth (LB)/kanamycin (100 μg/ml) agar plates. After colony growth, two replicates were made for each master membrane, and the bacteria were allowed to grow on the replica filters placed on fresh LB/kanamycin agar plates at 37°C. The replica membranes were then prepared for hybridization by placing them on a Whatman paper prewetted with 0.5 M NaOH for 30 s, followed by sequential washes in 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1.5 M NaCl. After UV cross-linking, using a Stratagene UV Crosslinker™ (model 1800), the filters were prehybridized for 2 h at 42°C in a solution of 0.8 M NaCl, 0.02 M PIPES (pH 6.5), 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS containing sonicated salmon sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) denatured by boiling for 10 min. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C in the presence of 7 × 106 cpm/filter of [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled TIMP-2 cDNA. After washing once for 30 min at 55°C with 3 × standard sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% SDS and once for 30 min at 55°C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, the filters were autoradiographed on an X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 2 days at −80°C. Positive colonies matching in both replicate filters were picked from the master filter and inoculated in 100 μl of LB/kanamycin and used for a secondary and a tertiary screening. This tertiary screening identified eight positive clones from the human placenta library and 12 positive clones from the human chromosome 17 library. The positive clones from the tertiary screening were then examined by Southern blot analysis, after digestion with EcoRI, using a 5′-end probe (a 2.6-kb PstI fragment containing exon 1), a 3′-end probe (a 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing the last exon) derived from a λ EMBL 3 library (23DeClerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and oligoprobes corresponding to TIMP-2 cDNA sequences extending from amino acid 21 to 27 (oligo YDC1: 5′-GCCAAAGCGGTCAGTGAGAAG-3′) and from amino acid 76 to 81 (oligo 1332: 5′-CTTTCCTCCAACGTCCAG-3′). These oligonucleotides correspond to TIMP-2 cDNA sequences located in corresponding exons 2 and 3 for TIMP-1 (26Coulombe B. Ponton A. Daigneault L. Williams B.R.G. Skup D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3227-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Seven among the eight positive clones derived from the human placenta library were found identical and hybridized with the 5′-end TIMP-2 probe. One was positive with the 3′-end probe. None of these eight clones hybridized with oligoprobes corresponding to putative exons 2 and 3. Among the 12 clones isolated from the chromosome 17 library, none hybridized with the 5′-end probe, but eight (including clone 27F6) hybridized with both oligoprobes YDC1 (putative exon 2) and 1332 (putative exon 3) and with the 3′-end probe. One clone (clone 67H4) hybridized with oligoprobe YDC1 only. One clone derived from the human placenta library and containing exon 1 (clone 1.3.3) and two clones derived from the chromosome 17 library (clones 67H4 and 27F6) were then selected to obtain the entire map of the human TIMP-2 gene. We used a modified method of Wahl et al. (27Wahl G.M. Lewis K.A. Ruiz J.C. Rothenberg B. Zhao J. Evans G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) to map the positions of the EcoRI sites in the TIMP-2 genomic clones. Genomic sequences from these positive clones including the flanking T3 and T7 promoter sequences were excised from either the pWE 15 vector or the SuperCos I vector by digestion with NotI. These genomic fragments were then subjected to partial digestion with EcoRI (1 μg of DNA digested in the presence of one unit of enzyme) for 5, 10, 20, and 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was blocked by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 50 mM), and the samples containing digested DNA were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel prior to transfer onto a nylon membrane and to hybridization in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP-labeled T3 and T7 oligonucleotides. Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction using primers derived from different exon sequences of the hTIMP-2 cDNA were also performed to determine the size of some introns and to confirm the mapping of the hTIMP-2 gene. Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line and mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were cultured in 60-mm tissue culture plates in the presence of minimum essential medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Two human bladder carcinoma cell lines (EJ and RT4; 28Ahlering T.E. Dubeau L. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6660-6665PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured as described previously. All the plasmids used to carry out the expression of the hTIMP-2 promoter were constructed using standard recombinant DNA technology (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 2.6-kb PstI genomic fragment flanking the 5′-region of the hTIMP-2 gene and extending into the first exon was isolated, cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced in both strands by the dideoxynucleotide method of Sanger et al. (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). From this fragment, a 2.3-kb PstI-NotI fragment extending from nt −2243 to nt +34 (from the transcription initiation site, TIS) was subcloned in orientation upstream of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene in pGL2-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to make pTIMP2-2243. This vector was then used to generate by digestion with exonuclease III (Erase-a-Base system, Promega) a series of subclones containing progressive unidirectional deletions from the 5′-end of the inserted TIMP-2 promoter. Seven deletion mutant clones were selected and sequenced on their 5′-end to identify the extent of the deletion (pTIMP2-2088, −1936, −1827, −1501, −1135, −585, and −276). These deletion constructs were then used in transient transfection assays in mouse NIH3T3 and human HT1080 cells. The reporter gene constructs were transfected using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method (31Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). As control for transfection efficiency, the plasmid pSV2β-Galactosidase (Promega) was co-transfected with each construct. After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed. Luciferase activity was measured as described by de Wet et al. (32de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activity was carried out using the Galacto-light™ kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The transfections were done in duplicate and carried out in at least three separate experiments using 10 μg of test plasmid and 1.5 μg of control plasmid for each 60-mm plate. Data were expressed as percentage of the relative activity (ratio of luciferase over β-galactosidase activities) obtained with the full-length promoter construct (pTIMP2-2243). When indicated, cells were treated with TPA using the following procedure. Twenty-four h after transfection, the culture medium was changed for medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (rather than 10%), and the cells were cultured for another 32 h. TPA (dissolved in ethanol) was then added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After 16 h, cells were harvested and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase expression as described above. Mutations in the hTIMP-2 promoter were achieved using the overlap extension method of Horton and Pease (33Horton R.M. Pease L.R. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217Google Scholar). We used an oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence located between positions −702 and −678 as a sense oligonucleotide (5′-CAATGCCTCTGCTGCGATCCTACTG-3′) and an oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence located in the pGL2-basic vector as an antisense oligonucleotide (5′-CATCCTCTAGAGGATAGAATGGCG-3′). Mutation in the TRE in the region −288 to −281 was achieved with two overlapping sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to a sequence (AAGGAGATCCAG) that substituted two thymidines in the TRE consensus (TGAGTCAG). This plasmid was designated pTIMP2-2243/AP-1*. Mutation that introduced a TRE between two thymidines in positions −71 and −72 was accomplished using overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence (GAGTCA). This plasmid was designated pTIMP2-2243+AP-1. DNase footprinting assays were carried out using a BamHI-NarI fragment (nt positions −519 to −188) of the hTIMP-2 promoter encompassing the AP-1 binding consensus sequence (positions −288 to −281). This fragment was [α-32P]dCTP-end-labeled at the NarI site using Klenow enzyme and gel-isolated. This labeled fragment was then incubated with DNaseI (1 unit/μl, diluted 1:3000-1:500) at 22°C in the presence or absence of purified c-Jun homodimer protein (Promega). Fragments generated were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 7 M urea containing acrylamide (5%) gel. The gel was then examined by autoradiography at −80°C. The level of methylation of the cytosines within the human TIMP-2 promoter was determined using restriction endonucleases HpaII and MspI as described by Chandler et al. (34Chandler L.A. DeClerck Y.A. Bogenmann E. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2944-2949PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to other restriction endonucleases whose activity is affected by methylation of the cytosines in their restriction sites (FnuDII, NarI, and NotI). A BamHI-ApaI fragment (positions −520 to +169) obtained by restriction digestion of the 2.6-kb PstI genomic fragment was used as probe for Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. Confluent cultures of HT1080 cells were treated with actinomycin D (final concentration 16 μM) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma). At indicated times RNA was extracted and processed for Northern blot analysis. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the method of Chirgwin et al. (35Chirgwin J. Przybyla A. MacDonald R. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Poly (A)+ RNA was obtained using the Poly(A)tract® mRNA isolation system (Promega). Cytoplasmic RNA samples (20 μg) were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-containing agarose (1%) gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Quantitative analysis of the mRNA was performed by measuring the intensity of the radioactive signals on a GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). By screening two genomic libraries, we isolated three overlapping genomic clones, which contained the entire human TIMP-2 gene, spanned in approximately 83 kb (Fig. 1). The gene is composed of five exons separated by four introns of 54.8, 2.7, 9.1, and 1.7 kb. The exon-intron boundaries for these five exons have splicing sites located at positions corresponding to amino acids 17, 51, 87, and 129 (Table I). Sequence analysis of these exon-intron boundaries was consistent with conserved sequences found in splicing sites with a GT motif on the donor site and an AG motif on the acceptor site.Table I.The exon-intron junctions of the human TIMP-2 geneExonIntron-exon-intron junctionExon sizeIntron sizentkb1….

Open table in a new tab The sequence of the 2.6-kb PstI genomic fragment containing the 5′-end of the hTIMP-2 gene and including part of the first exon is presented in Fig. 2. This region contains 2243 bp upstream of the major transcription initiation site (23DeClerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) that includes a TATA-like motif (AATAAAA, 36Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 50: 349-383Crossref Scopus (3284) Google Scholar) at positions −26 to −20, five consensus sequences for Sp1 (located at positions −1254 to −1246, −1222 to −1214, −493 to −485, −420 to −412, and −237 to −229), a complete consensus sequence for AP-1 (at positions −288 to −281), two binding motifs for AP-2 (at positions −277 to −270 and −213 to −206), and three PEA-3 binding sites (at positions −1657 to −1652, −842 to −837, and −726 to −721). In addition, some other consensus elements such as nuclear factor-1, NF-IL6, and myocyte-specific enhancer-binding factor-2 binding motifs were identified (37Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the most proximal region of the hTIMP-2 promoter extending from nt +1 to nt −300 has a G/C content of 76% and contains a typical CpG island (23DeClerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The promoter activity of 5′-end flanking region of the hTIMP-2 gene was examined by transient transfection assay in mouse NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Deletion of the region extending from nucleotide −2243 to −276, which includes most of the binding consensus, did not significantly affect the promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore the activity of the largest promoter construct (pTIMP2-2243) was in the same range as the activity of the smallest promoter construct (pTIMP2-276), suggesting an absence of involvement of the various binding consensus elements in the basal expression of the gene and confirming, as previously reported (23DeClerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Eeckhout Y. Rousseau G.G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 139: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), that the short −276 bp region encompassing a single Sp1 binding site and an AP-2 binding site contained all the elements required for basal expression.Fig. 3Promoter activity of the 2.3-kb 5′-flanking region of the hTIMP-2 gene.

Data represent the mean of four separate experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The presence of a complete AP-1 binding consensus (TGAGTCAG) at position −288 to −281 in the hTIMP-2 gene suggested that this element could play a regulating role in the transcription of the gene. We first examined by DNaseI footprint analysis whether this consensus could bind the c-Jun homodimer protein (Fig. 4). The data showed the presence of a clear zone of protection, which appeared in a dose-dependent manner with the addition of c-Jun homodimer (Fig. 4, lanes 2-5). Thus, the AP-1 consensus was found to bind AP-1 in vitro. To determine whether the AP-1 consensus was involved in basal expression of the hTIMP-2 gene, a mutation that replaced the TGAGTCAG consensus by a nonfunctional AAGGAGATGCAG consensus (38Buttice G. Quinones S. Kurkinen M. Nucl. Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3723-3731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was generated (Fig. 5A). This mutation resulted in a 22 and 38% decrease in the basal expression of the reporter gene in HT1080 and NIH3T3 cells, respectively (Fig. 5B), suggesting some involvement of the AP-1 consensus in basal gene expression.Fig. 5Mutation of the AP-1 binding site and its effect on basal expression and response to TPA.

https://openalex.org/W2011212909,"The laminin-binding α7β1 integrin receptor is expressed at high levels by skeletal and cardiac muscles and by certain melanocytic cells. We have assessed the potential role of the α7A/B integrin isoforms in mediating cell adhesion and motility and determined the laminin isoform specificity of this integrin. When MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, normally nonadherent to laminin 1, were stably transfected with cDNA for mouse α7, they adhered with high efficiency and migrated on laminin 1 substrates. Function-perturbing monoclonal antibodies generated to mouse α7 subunit blocked both adhesion and migration of α7 transfectants on laminin 1 substrates. Additional studies with MCF-7 transfectants revealed that α7β1 binds well to laminin 1 and to a mixture of laminin 2 and 4 but not to laminin 5. Importantly, α7β1 was capable of promoting motility on both laminin 1 and laminin 2/4 substrates. However, MCF-7 cells transfected with cDNA for either α7A or α7B showed no significant differences in cell adhesion or motility on laminin 1 substrates. Although the role for the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic variants of α7 remains unknown, the results establish that α7β1 mediates cell adhesive activities on a restricted number of laminin isoforms.

INTRODUCTIONLaminins are adhesive glycoproteins found in basement membranes that promote diverse cellular responses. Cell adherence to laminin matrices plays an important role in maintaining normal tissue organization and in tissue renewal and repair. The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix macromolecules like laminins is mediated primarily by heterodimeric receptors from the integrin superfamily (reviewed in 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar). Integrins provide linkage between the component elements of the extracellular matrix and the structural constituents inside the cell. Besides serving as adhesion receptors, integrins can transmit signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell interior that can activate several pathways, ultimately influencing an array of cellular properties including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 594-599Crossref Scopus (1460) Google Scholar).Laminin 1 was the first fully characterized isoform and is composed of α1, β1, and γ1 chains. This prototypic laminin is a large molecular weight trimer with multiple domains that are involved in cell adhesion and interactions with other basement membrane components such as nidogen, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (3Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Several other laminin isoforms have been identified and include laminin 2 (α2β1γ1, merosin), laminin 3 (α1β2γ1, S-laminin), laminin 4 (α2β2γ1, S-merosin), laminin 5 (α3β3γ2, kalinin/nicein/epiligrin), and less well characterized laminins 6-10 (reviewed in 3Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Delwel G.O. Sonnenberg A. Horton M.A. Adhesion Receptors as Therapeutic Targets.

The different laminin isoforms are tissue-specific and are expressed in a developmentally regulated pattern. Laminin 1 contains multiple sites for integrin-mediated cell attachment, which is effectuated by several β1 integrins (5Ziober B.L. Lin C.-S. Kramer R.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Of these α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1 bind to the long arm fragment E8 of laminin, produced by elastase digestion. The α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, which both contain the I domain, bind to the cross-region of laminin represented by the short arm fragment.The biological response to laminin appears to be cell type-specific, and this may be due in part to the specific integrin receptors expressed by individual cells. α7β1, originally found in melanoma cells, is a muscle-specific integrin (6Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) that binds to laminin (7Kramer R.H. Vu M.P. Cheng Y.F. Ramos D.M. Timpl R.

Several studies have shown that alternative splicing generates two isoform subsets: (i) X1 and X2 and (ii) A, B, and C, which differ at extracellular and cytoplasmic regions, respectively (10Ziober B.L.

Upon terminal differentiation of myoblasts, isoform switching and up-regulation of α7 expression are detected. The extracellular variants have altered sequence in the ligand binding domain and may have different laminin isoform specificity or affinity. The cytoplasmic isoforms, which share the common extracellular and transmembrane domains but differ at the cytoplasmic region, may trigger different biological functions when cells interact with laminin.In the present study, we have stably transfected MCF-7 carcinoma cells, which normally do not adhere to laminin 1, with mouse α7 cDNA. We also generated function-perturbing monoclonal antibodies to mouse α7 integrin to inhibit α7-extracellular matrix interactions. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that both α7A and α7B mediate adhesion and migration of MCF-7 transfectants on laminin 1 and laminin 2/4 substrates; however, α7β1 does not bind to laminin 5.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated that the α7β1 integrin can mediate adhesion and migration on a restricted number of laminin isoforms. We used two approaches successfully: (i) a gain of function approach by transfecting α7 cDNA into MCF-7 cells and (ii) a loss of function approach by using function-perturbing antibodies against α7 on cells expressing this integrin. Evidence obtained from these approaches clearly shows that exogenously expressed α7 confers on MCF-7 cells both the ability to bind and the ability to migrate on laminins. While this work was in preparation, Echtermeyer et al. (9Echtermeyer F. Schober S. Poschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2071-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) reported that transfection of mouse α7 cDNA into the human 293 embryonic kidney cells conferred a motile phenotype on laminin 1. Interestingly, this enhancement in motility occurred even though the parental cells expressed additional laminin 1-binding receptors.We examined the ligand specificity of the α7 receptor using available laminin isoforms. In MCF-7 α7 transfectants, α7β1 mediated binding to preparations of laminin 1 and to human placental laminins (a mixture of laminin 2 and 4). In contrast, laminin 5 was a poor substrate for α7-expressing cells. Eventually, when pure preparations are available, the functions of α7 should be tested on additional members of the laminin superfamily, especially laminin 2 (merosin), which is present in the basement membrane surrounding adult skeletal myofibers where α7 normally is detected. It is interesting that another laminin-binding integrin, α6β1, sharing high amino acid sequence homology with α7, not only binds to laminin 1 and human placental merosins (laminin 2 and 4) but also binds efficiently to laminin 5 (23Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F. Kuikman I. Paulsson M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25865-25875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, α6 can pair with β1 or β4 subunit, whereas as we show here in the MCF-7 transfectants, α7 pairs only with β1 subunit. Thus, even though α6 and α7 share strong amino acid sequence identity, there must be distinct domains that define both ligand specificity and pairing preferences. In the parental MCF-7 or transfectants, moderate levels of α2, α3, and α6 are expressed, yet these integrins are not capable of mediating adhesion or migration on laminin 1. It appears that this set of integrins, in contrast to α7, is not constitutively active for laminin 1. However, on laminin 2/4, this same set of integrins in the parental MCF-7 cells can mediate both adhesion and motility, yet in the transfectants is not fully competent for these adhesive interactions.It is interesting that α7 transfection appeared to decrease the ability of existing integrins on the MCF-7 cells to interact with laminin 2/4 and with laminin 5. One possibility for the decrease in the activity of integrins α2 and α3 is due to a decrease in their expression. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis confirms that the high expression of α7 caused a modest decrease in the expression level of α3. Another contributing factor may be that the high α7 expression produces a dominant negative effect that down-regulates the activity of the other integrins. Studies have suggested that certain integrins can produce a modulating effect on the function of other integrins. For example, in lymphocytes activation of LFA-1 can down-regulate α4 activity (24van Kooyk Y. van de Wiel-van Kemenade E. Weder P. Huijbens R.J. Figdor C.G. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A different phenomenon is observed in the α5-deficient CHO cells where full activity of αvβ3 receptor requires the presence of transfected α5 integrin (25Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus an integrin may induce down-regulation of another integrin's function, or alternatively two integrins may cooperate with each other to modulate function.It is conceivable that the cytoplasmic variants of α7 function differently. RNA alternative splicing events in the α cytoplasmic region have been detected in several integrin molecules, including α3, α6, and α7 (10Ziober B.L. Vu M.P. Waleh N. Crawford J. Lin C.-S.

Our results indicate that α7A and α7B receptors are equally active in their adhesive or migratory activities. It is possible that α7A/B, a muscle-specific integrin, will show differential activities only in the context of a muscle-specific environment.In summary, the results presented here show that α7β1 can mediate both cell adhesion and migration on laminin 1 and laminin 2/4. Importantly, we have demonstrated that α7 can interact with these different laminin substrates but not with epithelial cell-specific laminin 5. These results strongly support the role of the α7 receptor in mediating interactions with specific laminin isoforms. The tissue-specific expression of different family members of integrins and laminins (e.g. α7β1 and merosins in skeletal muscle (13Martin P.T. Kaufman S.J. Kramer R.H. Sanes J.R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Engvall E. Earwicker D. Jaaparanta T. Touslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regulation. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar)) suggests that there is a selective interaction that may be important in both embryonic development and tissue homeostasis. INTRODUCTIONLaminins are adhesive glycoproteins found in basement membranes that promote diverse cellular responses. Cell adherence to laminin matrices plays an important role in maintaining normal tissue organization and in tissue renewal and repair. The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix macromolecules like laminins is mediated primarily by heterodimeric receptors from the integrin superfamily (reviewed in 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar). Integrins provide linkage between the component elements of the extracellular matrix and the structural constituents inside the cell. Besides serving as adhesion receptors, integrins can transmit signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell interior that can activate several pathways, ultimately influencing an array of cellular properties including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (2Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 594-599Crossref Scopus (1460) Google Scholar).Laminin 1 was the first fully characterized isoform and is composed of α1, β1, and γ1 chains. This prototypic laminin is a large molecular weight trimer with multiple domains that are involved in cell adhesion and interactions with other basement membrane components such as nidogen, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (3Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Several other laminin isoforms have been identified and include laminin 2 (α2β1γ1, merosin), laminin 3 (α1β2γ1, S-laminin), laminin 4 (α2β2γ1, S-merosin), laminin 5 (α3β3γ2, kalinin/nicein/epiligrin), and less well characterized laminins 6-10 (reviewed in 3Timpl R. Brown J.C. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 4Delwel G.O. Sonnenberg A. Horton M.A. Adhesion Receptors as Therapeutic Targets.

The different laminin isoforms are tissue-specific and are expressed in a developmentally regulated pattern. Laminin 1 contains multiple sites for integrin-mediated cell attachment, which is effectuated by several β1 integrins (5Ziober B.L. Lin C.-S. Kramer R.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1996; 7: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Of these α3β1, α6β1, and α7β1 bind to the long arm fragment E8 of laminin, produced by elastase digestion. The α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, which both contain the I domain, bind to the cross-region of laminin represented by the short arm fragment.The biological response to laminin appears to be cell type-specific, and this may be due in part to the specific integrin receptors expressed by individual cells. α7β1, originally found in melanoma cells, is a muscle-specific integrin (6Song W.K. Wang W. Foster R.F. Bielser D.A. Kaufman S.J. J. Cell. Biol. 1992; 117: 643-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) that binds to laminin (7Kramer R.H. Vu M.P. Cheng Y.F. Ramos D.M. Timpl R.

PTH induces the immediate early gene, c-fos, in this cell type through a cAMP-dependent pathway.

By transiently transfecting c-fos promoter 5′ deletion constructs into UMR cells, we demonstrated that PTH induction of the c-fos promoter requires the major cAMP response element (CRE). Point mutations created in the major CRE within the largest construct inhibited both PTH-stimulated and basal expression. This element, therefore, performs concerted basal and PTH-responsive cis-acting functions. Gel retardation and Western blotting techniques revealed that CRE-binding protein (CREB) constitutively binds the major CRE but becomes phosphorylated at its cAMP-dependent protein kinase consensus recognition site following PTH treatment. CREB was functionally implicated in c-fos regulation by coexpressing a dominant CREB repressor, KCREB (killer CREB), with the c-fos promoter constructs.

As calcium-dependent signaling pathways have been implicated in neuronal plasticity, we examined visual cortical plasticity in mice lacking the alpha-isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alpha CaMKII). In wild-type mice, brief occlusion of vision in one eye during a critical period reduces responses in the visual cortex. In half of the alpha CaMKII-deficient mice, visual cortical responses developed normally, but visual cortical plasticity was greatly diminished. After intensive training, spatial learning in the Morris water maze was severely impaired in a similar fraction of mutant animals.

To assess the function of CK 8 as a plasminogen receptor, monoclonal antibody 1E8 was raised against the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of CK 8. The 1E8 epitope was present on the external surfaces of breast cancer cells, as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. 125I-1E8 bound to MCF-7 cells; the maximum binding capacity (1.5 × 106 sites per cell) was comparable with that determined for plasminogen. When MCF-7 cells were incubated with Fab fragments of 1E8, specific 125I-plasminogen binding was decreased up to 82%. Specific plasminogen binding was decreased up to 67%, even when the unbound 1E8 Fab was removed by washing the cells prior to adding 125I-plasminogen. Preincubation with 1E8 Fab decreased plasminogen binding to BT20 and MDA-MB-157 cells, although to a lesser extent than with MCF-7 cells.

A mouse brain cDNA library in λgt11 was screened for this association, and two positive clones encoding tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 were isolated. SH-PTP2 has two SH2 domains and is believed to function as a positive mediator in receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. SH-PTP2 and BIT were coimmunoprecipitated from phosphorylated rat brain lysate, and BIT was a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with SH-PTP2 in this lysate. This interaction was also observed in Jurkat T cells transfected with BIT cDNA depending on tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT. Bisphosphotyrosyl peptides corresponding to BIT-TAMs stimulated SH-PTP2 activity 33-35-fold in vitro, indicating that two SH2 domains of SH-PTP2 simultaneously interact with two phosphotyrosines of BIT-TAM. Our findings suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT results in stimulation of the signal transduction pathway promoted by SH-PTP2 and that BIT is probably a major receptor molecule in the brain located just upstream of SH-PTP2.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in signal transduction and regulates a wide range of cellular processes. Protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases are highly expressed in the central nervous system, consistent with the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in neural function (1Wagner K.R. Mei L. Hugnir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1991; 1: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

(a brain immunoglobulin-like molecule with myrosine-based activation motifs) is a novel immune antigen receptor-like molecule of the brain. 2S. Sano, H. Ohnishi, A. Omori, J. Hasegawa, and M. Kubota, submitted for publication. This molecule is composed of an antigen receptor-like extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic region containing two variants of TAM (myrosine-based activation motif) that was recently designated ITAM (immunoreceptor TAM). This cytoplasmic motif contains two tyrosine phosphorylation sites. TAM was originally described in the immune system where it plays a crucial role in the activation responses of B and T cells (2Reth M.

BIT is one of major substrates of protein-tyrosine kinase(s) in crude brain suspensions2 and is widely distributed in the brain in synapse-rich regions and in some nerve fibers. 3S. Sano, I. Nihonmatsu, H. Ohnishi, and E. Senba, manuscript in preparation. These findings suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of TAMs in BIT may be involved in neural signal transduction. Recent studies in the immune system have demonstrated that the oligomerization of TAMs allows the phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues found in this motif and these phosphotyrosine residues act as a bidentate docking site for the paired Src homology 2 (SH2) domains present in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, Syk and ZAP-70, believed to be indispensable for initiation of the signaling cascade (6Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

From these investigations, we predicted that TAMs of BIT may recruit tyrosine kinases containing paired SH2 domains to the inner face of the plasma membrane and thus initiate neural signaling. To ascertain the role of BIT in signal transduction, we isolated and characterized cDNA clones encoding the BIT-TAMs-binding protein by Far Western blotting. In contrast to our expectations, the cDNA clones obtained encoded the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing paired SH2 domains, SH-PTP2 (also termed PTP1D, SH-PTP3, PTP2C, PTPL1, or Syp). We demonstrated here that tyrosine-phosphorylated BIT and SH-PTP2 can interact both in vitro and in living cells, and that phosphotyrosyl peptides derived from BIT-TAMs are capable of evoking catalytic activity of SH-PTP2. BIT is probably a major receptor molecule located just upstream of SH-PTP2 in the signal transduction pathway in the brain. brain immunoglobulin-like molecule with tyrosine-based activation motifs tyrosine-based activation motif immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif Src homology 2 glutathione S-transferase peroxidase anti-peroxidase complex 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis p-nitrophenyl phosphate p-nitrophenol phosphotyrosyl residue N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycalbonyl high performance liquid chromatography insulin receptor substrate 1. The anti-BIT monoclonal antibody, named 1D4, and anti-BIT polyclonal antibodies which we used have been described (9Sano S. Matsuda Y. Nakagawa H. J. Biochem. 1989; 105: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Sano S. Ito S. Nakamura M. Nakagawa H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against SH-PTP2 and Grb2, and a monoclonal antibody against glutathione S-transferase (GST) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A monoclonal antibody against SH-PTP2 was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG + A + M, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-mouse IgG + A + M and monoclonal mouse peroxidase anti-peroxidase complex (PAP) were from Zymed. Polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Cappel. DNA sequence analysis was performed using an AutoRead sequencing kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and an A. L. F. DNA sequencer II (Pharmacia). A DNA fragment corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of BIT (amino acids 397-509) was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from rat BIT cDNA.2 BamHI and EcoRI sites were included at the ends of the forward primer (5′-ACCGGATCCGAATCAAACAGAAGAAAGCC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-ACAGAATTCATCACTTCCTCTGGACTTGG-3′), respectively, to facilitate cloning. Tandem stop codons were also introduced in the reverse primer. The amplified DNA was isolated, digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Pharmacia). The cloned sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The GST fusion protein (GST-BIT) expression vector was used to transform Escherichia coli JM109 to ampicillin resistance, and the expressed fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Pharmacia) according to the instruction manual. The purified GST-BIT fusion protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated with recombinant c-Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). GST-BIT fusion protein, bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B, was washed with and suspended in phosphorylation buffer containing 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM 1,4-dithiothreitol. To start the reaction, ATP and c-Src kinase were added to final concentrations of 3.3 mM and 50 units/ml, respectively, and then the solution was incubated at 30°C with gentle shaking. After 24-h incubation, the resin was collected and rinsed with phosphorylation buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris·HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the fusion proteins was checked by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. Rat brain homogenate (10%) in 15 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and the sediment was discarded. After addition of CHAPS to a final concentration of 1%, the supernatant was incubated at 4°C for 2 h and centrifuged at 540,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was used for SDS-PAGE on 10-20% polyacrylamide gradient gels, and separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blotting, denaturation, and renaturation of filter bound proteins were carried out as described previously (11Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Martin G.S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). After renaturation, nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h in buffer A (20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, rinsed with buffer B (20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM KCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), and then incubated at 4°C overnight in buffer A containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk and 4 μg/ml of GST fusion proteins. The nitrocellulose filter was then rinsed in buffer B at room temperature and incubated at 4°C overnight in buffer A containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 1 μg/ml of anti-GST monoclonal antibody. After washing with buffer B, the filter was incubated at room temperature for 1 h in buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG + A + M (1/2000-dilution). Blots were developed with ECL (Amersham Corp.). A λgt11 cDNA expression library constructed from adult BALB/c mouse brain (ML1042b) was obtained from Clontech. Recombinant clones expressing GST-BIT binding proteins were identified by Far Western blotting using tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-BIT and anti-GST monoclonal antibody. Positive plaques were developed by the PAP method as described previously (10Sano S. Ito S. Nakamura M. Nakagawa H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts isolated from positive recombinant phages were subcloned into Bluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene), and the sequences were determined. DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed using an application software, GENETYX-SV/R and GENETYX-SV/DB (Software Development). Rat brain homogenate (8%) in 15 mM Tris-HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the sediment was discarded, and the supernatant was diluted with the same volume of Tris-HEPES buffer and incubated with or without 10 mM ATP in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM MnCl2 at 30°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with the same volume of NEHPF solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 15 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 50 mM NaF. Proteins were solubilized with 1% CHAPS at 4°C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 540,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, the sediments were discarded, and the clear supernatants were used as lysate samples. To immunoprecipitate BIT, the lysate samples were mixed with monoclonal antibody 1D4-Sepharose or control mouse IgG-Sepharose (Cappel) at 4°C overnight. In a similar way, SH-PTP2 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using polyclonal anti-SH-PTP2 antibodies and protein A-agarose (Pierce), or rabbit normal serum and protein A-agarose as a control. The washed immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with several antibodies. Detection was carried out using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's protocol or the PAP method as described previously (10Sano S. Ito S. Nakamura M. Nakagawa H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells transfected with rat BIT cDNA2 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418. The cDNA used for transfection contained the complete open reading frame of BIT. The Jurkat cells (2 × 107 cells) were incubated with or without 10 μl of monoclonal anti-BIT antibody (1D4) (1 mg/ml) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C for 20 min, then washed with 5 ml of RPMI 1640 at 4°C and suspended in 60 μl of RPMI 1640. After preincubation at 37°C for 5 min, cellular BIT was cross-linked by applying 30 μl of polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (1 mg/ml) at 37°C for 0, 2, 5, and 15 min. The reactions were stopped by adding NP-lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 500 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solubilized materials were centrifuged, and the supernatants were incubated with anti-BIT serum and protein A-agarose at 4°C for 1 h. The washed immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with 4G10, 1D4, and anti-SH-PTP2 monoclonal antibodies. A 2.2-kilobase pair KpnI-ApaI cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of SH-PTP2 was isolated, and the ApaI site was polished. The cDNA fragment was subcloned into KpnI/NotI-digested pBluescript II SK(−) (Stratagene) whose NotI site was blunted. A 2.2-kilobase pair AccII-AccII fragment encoding amino acid residues 4-597 of SH-PTP2 was isolated from this plasmid and inserted into blunt-ended EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Pharmacia) to yield a GST-SH-PTP2 fusion protein expression plasmid, pGEX-2T-SH-PTP2. Bacterial expression and purification of SH-PTP2 were carried out as described elsewhere (12Dechert U. Adam M. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5602-5611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that we used E. coli strain JM109 as a host strain. With p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate, typically 20 mM pNPP and the effector phosphopeptide (varying concentrations) were incubated with 25 μg/ml recombinant SH-PTP2 at 24°C in 100 μl of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.25) containing 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM dithiothreitol. At 30-min intervals, 30 μl of the reaction mixture were quenched with 40 μl of 5 M NaOH, and after 15 min at room temperature, the absorbance of p-nitrophenol (pNP) at 405 nm was determined. The amount of pNP was calculated by comparison with a standard curve obtained with pNP (Nacalai Tesque). To assay the dephosphorylation of phosphopeptides, the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured with a tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Typically, 370 μM substrate phosphopeptide and 27.7 μM effector phosphopeptide were incubated with 37 μg/ml SH-PTP2 at 24°C in 27 μl of 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.1) containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 2 mM EDTA. At 5-min intervals, 8 μl of the reaction mixture were quenched with 100 μl of malachite green solution, and after 15 min at room temperature the absorbance at 620 nm was measured. The amount of released Pi was calculated from a standard curve. The sequences of the synthesized phosphopeptides used in this study were as follows (pY indicates phosphorylated tyrosine): 1D4NTAM2P, NDINDITpYADLNLPKEKKPAPRVPEPNNHTEpYASIETGKL-NH2; 1D4CTAM2P, RPEDTLTpYADLDMVHLNRAQPTPKPEPSFSEpYASVQVQRK; 1D4PTP3, RPEDTLTpYADLDMVHLNR-NH2; 1D4PTP4, PKPEPSFSEpYASVQVQRK. A nonphosphorylated peptide, 1D4CTAM, with the sequence RPEDTLTYADLDMVHLNRAQPTPKPEPSFSEYASVQVQRK was also synthesized. All of these peptides were synthesized by solid phase methodology of N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycalbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer (13Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosyl residues were introduced by use of Fmoc-Tyr(PO3H2)-OH (14Ottinger E.A. Shekels L.L. Bernlohr D.A. Barany G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4354-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The crude products were purified by gel filtration with Sephadex G-25F (Pharmacia) or G-50F (Pharmacia) followed by ion exchange chromatography with CM-cellulose CM-52 (Whatman) or DEAE-cellulose DE-52 (Whatman). Final purification was achieved by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an octadecylsilane column until peptides migrated as a single peak. Structures and the purity of synthetic peptides were confirmed by HPLC, amino acid analysis, amino acid sequence analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry measurement. Phosphopeptide, Src-C, with the sequence TSTEPQpYQPGENL was included with the tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins from rat brain were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter, and overlaid with GST fusion proteins. Binding of the fusion protein was revealed with anti-GST antibody. Only tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-BIT fusion protein could bind to the 70-kDa protein on the filter (Fig. 1). GST alone or the unphosphorylated GST fusion protein did not exhibit any binding. These results demonstrate that the observed interaction is specific and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT-TAMs where all four cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are located. Essentially the same results were obtained when mouse brain proteins were used instead of those from rat brain (data not shown). The tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-BIT fusion protein was used as a probe to screen expression libraries from BALB/c mouse brain. 400,000 plaques were screened and four positive clones (nos. 8, 20, 25, and 33) were identified. The positive signals of clones 25 and 33 were more intense than those of clones 8 and 20. The DNA sequences from the insert of clone 8 and 20 were used to search the DNA sequence data bases, but no significant homologies were detected (data not shown). The DNA sequences from the inserts of clones 25 and 33 were almost identical. The insert of clone 25 was slightly longer than that of clone 33, with an additional 20 and 8 nucleotides at 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. A homology search of the DNA data bases revealed that these inserts are parts of the cDNA of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SH-PTP2. These clones encoded only two SH2 domains and lacked its phosphatase domain. These results suggest that the tyrosine-phosphorylated BIT-TAM associates directly with the SH2 domain(s) of SH-PTP2. To obtain the remaining coding region for SH-PTP2, the library was rescreened using the cloned fragment of clone 33 as a probe, and three overlapping clones were isolated. Two of them were used for reconstruction of a cDNA containing the complete open reading frame. 4The nucleotide sequence data of the BALB/c mouse SH-PTP2 reported in this paper will appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bases with accession number D84372. The deduced amino acid sequence of BALB/c mouse SH-PTP2 was highly homologous to the human SH-PTP2 (15Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11239-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 16Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) sharing a 98.8% identity. The calculated molecular mass of the cloned mouse SH-PTP2 is 68.4 kDa, consistent with the results of Far Western blotting. To assess the potential association of SH-PTP2 with BIT, we initially examined the ability of anti-BIT monoclonal antibody (1D4) to coimmunoprecipitate SH-PTP2. The 1D4 monoclonal antibody recognizes a extracellular region of BIT (10Sano S. Ito S. Nakamura M. Nakagawa H. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1252-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat brain crude suspension with ATP resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT, and SH-PTP2 was coimmunoprecipitated in response to ATP incubation (Fig. 2). The amounts of BIT in the immunoprecipitates with or without ATP treatment were equivalent. The reverse was also examined. When SH-PTP2 was immunoprecipitated, BIT was coimmunoprecipitated in a ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that coimmunoprecipitated with SH-PTP2 comigrated with BIT, and there were no other detectable species except for SH-PTP2 itself, indicating that BIT is a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with SH-PTP2 in the lysate. Moreover, we examined the possibility of Grb2 coimmunoprecipitation with the BIT-SH-PTP2 complex. Grb2, an adapter molecule that has been reported to associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated SH-PTP2 (17Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also coimmunoprecipitated with BIT in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The interaction between BIT and SH-PTP2 was also observed in Jurkat T cells transfected with rat BIT cDNA. Immunoprecipitates of BIT from the Jurkat cells contained trace amounts of SH-PTP2, indicating the possibility of slight phosphorylation of BIT in Jurkat cells. When BIT on the cells was cross-linked with monoclonal anti-BIT antibody (1D4) and polyclonal anti-mouse IgG, the BIT was tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the amount of coimmunoprecipitated SH-PTP2 increased in proportion to the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT (Fig. 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT increased for 2-5 min and then decreased. Phosphorylation of BIT occurred a little faster than when induced by cross-linking with polyclonal anti-BIT antibody,2 possibly due to the different efficiency of cross-linking. Polyclonal anti-mouse IgG or monoclonal anti-BIT alone (data not shown) were unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT. Our results demonstrated that the association between BIT and SH-PTP2 can also take place in living Jurkat T cells and is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of BIT. To elucidate the effect of tyrosine-phosphorylated BIT-TAM binding on SH-PTP2, we examined whether addition of a phosphotyrosyl peptide corresponding to BIT-TAM affected the phosphatase activity of SH-PTP2. Recombinant SH-PTP2 was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and was used to assay the enzyme activity. Two BIT-TAMs were named N-TAM and C-TAM according to their position in the amino acid sequence of BIT. Each BIT-TAM has two tyrosine phosphorylation sites (N-TAM, Tyr-436 and Tyr-460; C-TAM, Tyr-477 and Tyr-501) flanked by well conserved amino acid sequences. There is no other tyrosine residue in the cytoplasmic region of BIT. It has been reported that tyrosine kinases, Syk and ZAP-70, possessing tandem SH2 domains like SH-PTP2, interact with TAM when its two tyrosine residues are phosphorylated (6Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 7Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S. Phillips T.B. Ram M.K. Theriault K. Zoller M.J. Karas J.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, we designed bisphosphorylated peptides 1D4NTAM2P and 1D4CTAM2P based on the amino acid sequences of N-TAM and C-TAM, respectively. Phosphatase activity was assayed at a fixed pNPP concentration of 20 mM (Fig. 5A). In the absence of the peptide, the velocity (k) for SH-PTP2-catalyzed release of pNP was 0.11 s−1. Both of the bisphosphopeptides, 1D4NTAM2P and 1D4CTAM2P, stimulated the catalytic activity in a concentration-dependent manner (maximal effect was seen at 100 μM). The maximal rate of pNP release was increased 7-8-fold (k(0.87 s−1) with 1D4CTAM2P and k(0.79 s−1) with 1D4NTAM2P at 100 μM peptide) (Fig. 5A). This potent activation was dependent on the phosphotyrosine residues of the peptides since an unphosphorylated peptide, 1D4CTAM, had no effect. Two monophosphrylated peptides, 1D4PTP3 and 1D4PTP4, corresponding to two tyrosine phosphorylation sites of C-TAM were also used as effector peptides. 1D4PTP3 stimulated SH-PTP2 catalytic activity 4-5-fold (k(0.50 s−1)) but 1D4PTP4 had no effect. An equimolar mixture of the monophosphopeptides 1D4PTP3 and 1D4PTP4 yielded a velocity of 0.52 s−1 at 340 μM total peptide concentration. This effect was nearly equivalent to that elicited by 1D4PTP3 alone. The activation effects by the bisphosphopeptides were greater than those produced by the two monophosphorylated peptides. The stimulatory effects of BIT-TAMs on SH-PTP2 were more marked when a phosphopeptide was used as a substrate (Fig. 5B). Phosphatase activity was assayed at a fixed Src-C phosphopeptide concentration of 370 μM. In the absence of the effector phosphopeptide (1D4NTAM2P or 1D4CTAM2P), the Src-C peptide was dephosphorylated very slowly (k(2.2 × 10−3 s−1)). When Src-C was incubated with the effector peptide, Pi release was markedly stimulated (Fig. 5B). The reaction rates of Pi release in the presence of the effector peptides 1D4NTAM2P and 1D4CTAM2P were k(85.5 × 10−3 s−1) and k(79.8 × 10−3 s−1), respectively. In the reaction mixture containing the substrate peptide (Src-C) and the effector peptide, Pi could be released from both peptides. In practice, when only the effector peptide (27.8 μM) was incubated with SH-PTP2, it was dephosphorylated, and thus behaved as a substrate (k(8.4 × 10−3 s−1) for 1D4NTAM2P and k(7.2 × 10−3 s−1) for 1D4CTAM2P). In this case, the peptide was considered to be both an activator (effector) and a substrate. Consequently, it was not clear which peptide produced the observed activation. However, when pNPP was used as a substrate, Src-C had no effect on the catalytic activity of SH-PTP2 (data not shown), thus suggesting that the 1D4NTAM2P or 1D4CTAM2P (effector peptide) stimulated catalytic activity of SH-PTP2 for Src-C (substrate peptide). Assuming simply that the difference between two reaction rates for Pi release observed under the two conditions (± Src-C peptide in the presence of the effector peptide) is the actual rate for Pi release from the Src-C peptide, 1D4NTAM2P and 1D4CTAM2P stimulated the dephosphorylation rate by 35-fold (k(77.1 × 10−3 s−1)) and 33-fold (k(72.6 × 10−3 s−1)), respectively. This study demonstrated a direct interaction between tyrosine-phosphorylated BIT-TAMs and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2, and an activation effect of this interaction on the phosphatase activity. SH-PTP2 is a cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase that possesses two SH2 domains (15Freeman Jr., R.M. Plutzky J. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2034190304,"In yeast, as in other eukaryotes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) can be synthesized via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine or from free choline via the CDP-choline pathway. In yeast, PC biosynthesis is required for the repression of the phospholipid biosynthetic genes, including the INO1 gene, in response to inositol. In this study, we analyzed the effect of mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in PC biosynthesis on the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid biosynthetic genes. We report that repression of INO1 transcription in response to inositol is clearly dependent on ongoing PC biosynthesis, but it is independent of the route of synthesis. Our results also suggest that intermediates in the phosphatidylethanolamine methylation and CDP-choline pathways are not responsible for generating the regulatory signal that results in repression of INO1 and other coregulated genes of phospholipid biosynthesis. Furthermore, repression of INO1 is not tightly correlated to the proportion of PC in the total cellular phospholipids. Rather, we report that when the rate of synthesis of PC becomes growth limiting, the addition of inositol fails to repress the phospholipid biosynthetic genes, but when the rate of PC synthesis is sufficient to sustain normal growth, the addition of inositol to the growth medium has the effect of repressing INO1 and other phospholipid biosynthetic genes.

Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized in eukaryotic cells via two distinct pathways. One pathway involves three sequential methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PEphosphatidylethanolaminePCphosphatidylcholine.The structural genes used are: INO1inositol-1-phosphate synthaseCHO1phosphatidylserine synthaseCHO2 (PEM1)PE N-methyltransferaseOPI3 (PEM2)phospholipid N-methyltransferaseCKI1choline kinaseCPT1sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferaseEPT1sn-1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolamine phosphotransferase. (1Bremer J. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, PC can be synthesized from free choline via the CDP-choline (“Kennedy”) pathway (2Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 193-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two pathways are found in all eukaryotes that have been investigated, including mammals (3Bjornstad P. Bremer J. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 38-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (4Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 5Waechter C. Lester R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1973; 158: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In mammals, synthesis from free choline via the CDP-choline pathway represents the major route of PC biosynthesis. Synthesis of PC via the methylation of PE has been detected only in hepatocytes and brain cells (3Bjornstad P. Bremer J. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 38-45Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast, PC can be synthesized de novo via the methylation pathway or, when choline is present in the growth medium, via the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 1). phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine. inositol-1-phosphate synthase phosphatidylserine synthase PE N-methyltransferase phospholipid N-methyltransferase choline kinase sn-1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase sn-1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolamine phosphotransferase. Phospholipid biosynthesis is highly regulated in yeast and, curiously, the regulation of inositol- and choline-containing phospholipids is coordinated. Much of this coordinate regulation occurs at the level of gene transcription in response to the soluble precursors inositol and choline. In the presence of inositol, transcription of coregulated biosynthetic genes is repressed. If choline is added to medium in which inositol is already present, the genes are further repressed. However, if choline is present in the growth medium by itself, it has little or no effect on transcription of the coregulated genes. Genes that have been shown to exhibit this pattern of transcriptional regulation include INO1 (inositol-1-phosphate synthase), CKI1 (choline kinase), CPT1 (choline phospho-transferase), CHO1 (phosphatidylserine synthase), CHO2/PEM1 (phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase), and OPI3/PEM2 (phospholipid methyltransferase) (Fig. 1). The genes encoding the inositol and choline transporters are also subject to this regulation (6Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar, 7Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiology Review. 1996; Vol. 60: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structural genes that show this coordinated regulation in response to inositol and choline all respond to a single set of regulatory genes, including INO2, INO4, and OPI1 (6Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar, 7Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiology Review. 1996; Vol. 60: 1-20Crossref Google Scholar). Another intriguing aspect of this coordinated regulatory response is its dependence on ongoing PC biosynthesis. Yeast strains carrying mutations in the CHO1, CHO2, or OPI3 structural genes are conditionally defective in PC biosynthesis (see Fig. 1 for the position of each lesion in the pathway). The cho1, cho2, and opi3 mutants also exhibit a conditional overproduction of inositol (Opi−) phenotype (9Greenberg M.L. Klig L.S. Letts V.A. Loewy B.S. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 11Summers E.F. Letts V.A.

The Opi− phenotype is indicative of overexpression of inositol-1-phosphate synthase due to misregulation of the INO1 gene (10Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the cho1, cho2, and opi3 mutants all have been shown to derepress INO1 in the presence of inositol (9Greenberg M.L. Klig L.S. Letts V.A. Loewy B.S. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 791-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell.

The other coregulated enzymes, including the CHO1, CHO2, and OPI3 gene products themselves, as well as enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway, show this same pattern of aberrant regulation when PC biosynthesis is interrupted (6Paltauf F. Kohlwein S. Henry S.A. Broach J. Jones E. Pringle J. Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Vol II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415Google Scholar). Normal regulation in response to inositol is restored in these mutants and their Opi− phenotype is eliminated if a metabolite that enters the PC biosynthetic pathway downstream of the genetic block is supplied exogenously. Thus, INO1 regulation is restored in cho1 mutants (which are defective in phosphatidylserine biosynthesis) if ethanolamine, monomethylethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, or choline is supplied (13Letts V.A. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 560-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of INO1 is restored in cho2 mutants (which are defective in PE methylation) in response to each of the three methylated species, but not in response to ethanolamine (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In opi3 mutants, regulation is restored only in response to dimethylethanolamine or choline (14McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 317-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of mutations in the CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis on this regulation had not been explored when we commenced this study. In the present study, we have analyzed the role of PC metabolism in regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis by determining the effects of mutations in both routes of PC biosynthesis, alone or in combination. Our results demonstrate that the regulatory response is independent of the route of synthesis of PC. Analysis of the phospholipid content and growth properties of strains carrying mutations in PC biosynthesis suggests that the transcriptional response to inositol is most likely generated by the formation of PC itself and not by the availability of choline or any other intermediate in PC biosynthesis. Sources of materials were: [32P]orthophosphate (carrier free), [α-32P]cytidine 5′-triphosphate (specific activity, 800 Ci/mmol), [methyl-14C]choline chloride (specific activity, 40-60 mCi/mmol), DuPont NEN; SG81 paper, GF/A glass fiber filters, Whatman; nitrocellulose, Schleicher & Schüll; SP6/T7 Transcription Kit, Boehringer Mannheim. All other materials were reagent grade or better. To analyze which steps in PC biosynthesis are required for generation of the signal necessary for proper regulation of the coregulated genes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis, we constructed strains with defects in either one or both routes of PC biosynthesis (i.e. CDP-choline and methylation pathways, as shown in Fig. 1). To block the methylation pathway, we chose the cho2 mutant, which is defective in the first methylation step in the conversion of PE to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine. Strains carrying the cho2 gene disruption have grossly altered membrane phospholipid composition (PC content, between 6 and 10% of total phospholipid) and grow considerably slower than wild-type strains in the absence of choline or its methylated precursors (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Summers, E., 1989, Phospholipid Methylation and the Regulation of Phospholipid Biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.Google Scholar). To block the CDP-choline pathway, we used a strain in which the CKI1 gene was disrupted, as well as a double mutant strain carrying CPT1 and EPT1 gene disruptions simultaneously. The CKI1 gene encodes choline kinase, and when this gene is disrupted, yeast cells lose almost all of their choline kinase activity and most of their ethanolamine kinase activity (16Hosaka K. Tsumomu K. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cpt1 and ept1 mutations block the last steps of the CDP-choline pathway and the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, respectively, which are necessary for the formation of PC and PE from sn-1,2-diacylglycerol and CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine. We used a double mutant strain since it has been shown that the CPT1 and EPT1 gene products are both capable of catalyzing the cholinephosphotransferase reaction in vitro (17Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5094-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contribution of the EPT1 gene product to this reaction is much lower than that of the CPT1 gene product, but it is still noticeable in vivo (18McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HJ000 strains (cpt1, ept1) and their congenic wild-type parental strain, DBY746, were generously provided by Dr. Robert Bell (Duke University Medical Center). To construct a CHO2 disruption in the genetic background of cpt1, ept1, the SalI-BglII internal fragment of the CHO2 gene (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Summers, E., 1989, Phospholipid Methylation and the Regulation of Phospholipid Biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine.Google Scholar), carried on plasmid pSPT18 (Boehringer Mannheim), was replaced with the TRP1 gene. This construct was used to generate a disruption of the CHO2 gene in HJ000 (cpt1, ept1) and its congenic wild-type parental strain, DBY746, by homologous recombination (19Rothstein R.J. Wu R. Grossman L. Moldave K. Methods in Enzymology: Recombinant DNA. Vol 101C. Academic Press, New York1983: 202Google Scholar). Stable TRP+ transformants were tested for the characteristic cho2 mutant inositol excretion (Opi−) phenotype (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A.

Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the disruption of a CHO2 gene was confirmed by the absence of CHO2 mRNA on Northern blots. In this way, we obtained a set of isogenic strains with blocks in the methylation pathway, the CDP-choline pathway, or simultaneously in both pathways.

Strain CTY393 was crossed to w303-1B and sporulated. Spore SH335 was crossed to DC5 to generate diploid SH336. A CHO2 disruption in the cki1 background was carried out in diploid strain SH336. The CHO2 gene in SH336 was disrupted by LEU2 gene using a construct similar to one used by Summers et al. (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A.

Strain SH336, with a disrupted CHO2 gene, was sporulated and sister spores 1-9A, 1-9B, 1-9C, and 1-9D (genotypes given in Table I) were used in further studies. Yeast strains were maintained on YEPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 3% glucose). Vitamin-defined synthetic media contained, per liter: 30 g of glucose, 5 g of ammonium sulfate, 1 g of potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.5 g of magnesium sulfate, 0.1 g of sodium chloride, 0.1 g of calcium chloride, 0.5 mg of boric acid, 0.04 mg of cupric sulfate, 0.1 mg of potassium iodide, 0.2 mg of ferric chloride, 0.4 mg of manganese sulfate, 0.2 mg of sodium molybdate, 0.4 mg of zinc sulfate, 20 mg of adenine, 20 mg of arginine, 20 mg of histidine, 60 mg of leucine, 230 mg of lysine, 20 mg of methionine, 300 mg of threonine, 20 mg of tryptophan, 40 mg of uracil, 2 μg of biotin, 400 μg of panthothenate, 2 μg of folic acid, 400 μg of niacin, 200 μg of p-aminobenzoic acid, 400 μg of pyridoxine hydrochloride. Where indicated, media were supplemented with 75 μM inositol (I+) and/or 1 mM choline (C+). All cultures were grown aerobically at 30°C with shaking. Genetic techniques such as mating, sporulation, and tetrad dissection were carried out using standard methodologies (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was done by the lithium acetate method (21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucl. Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. RNA probes for Northern blot hybridization were synthesized according to manufacturer recommendations for the SP6/T7 Transcription Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) from plasmids described in Hudak et al. (22Hudak K.A. Lopes J.M. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1994; 136: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), linearized with a restriction enzyme, and transcribed with a RNA polymerase as follows (plasmid/restriction enzyme/RNA polymerase): pAB309Δ/EcoRI/SP6 (TCM1), pMH203/EcoRI/SP6 (OPI3), pJH310/HindIII/T7 (INO1), pTG109/BamHI/T7 (CHO2). RNA was isolated from yeast using glass bead disruption and hot phenol extraction (23Elion E.A. Warner J.R. Cell. 1984; 39: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The TCM1 ribosomal protein gene, expression of which is unaffected by availability of inositol and choline, was used as a standard for RNA loading, as described previously (10Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Northern hybridization was performed essentially as described by Hirsch and Henry (10Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the results were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by an AMBIS 4000 phosphorimager (AMBIS, Inc.). Steady-state labeling with [32P]orthophosphate was performed following the method of Atkinson et al. (24Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were labeled for at least five generations with 5 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate/ml in synthetic media, as described above, and harvested in the late logarithmic phase of growth (unless otherwise indicated). Labeled lipids were extracted as described by Atkinson et al. (24Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional paper chromatography on silica-impregnated paper was carried out using the method of Steiner and Lester (4Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Labeled spots corresponding to specific lipids were quantified using an AMBIS 4000 phosphorimager. Yeast cells were grown for at least five to six generations with 0.2 μCi/ml of [methyl-14C]choline chloride (specific activity, 40-60 mCi/mmol) in vitamin-defined synthetic media containing 1 mM of unlabeled choline. Cultures were harvested in late logarithmic phase to early stationary phase of growth. Lipids were extracted as described by Atkinson et al. (24Atkinson K.D. Jensen B. Kolat A.I. Storm E.M. Henry S.A. Fogel S. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 558-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and separated in the first dimension using the method of Steiner and Lester (4Steiner M.R. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 260: 222-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The position of radioactively labeled PC was determined by autoradiography. Labeled spots were removed and counted by liquid scintillation. Yeast cultures were grown overnight in vitamin-defined synthetic medium containing 75 μM inositol and 1 mM choline (I+C+) to mid-logarithmic phase of growth, when radiolabeled choline was added (1 μCi/ml, 40-60 mCi/mmol [methyl-14C]choline chloride). Uptake was allowed to proceed for 60 min at 30°C with shaking. Samples were taken at indicated time points, and choline uptake was terminated by vacuum filtration of cultures through Whatman GF/A glass fiber filters, which were immediately rinsed with 15 ml of ice-cold 20 mM choline. The filters were allowed to dry, and the associated radiolabel was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The triple mutant strain cpt1, ept1, cho2 (HJ000 cho2) is viable but displayed relatively slow growth regardless of the presence or absence of choline in the medium. The doubling time for this strain was 6.5 h in synthetic medium with or without choline (Table II). Summers et al. (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that when cho2 strains are shifted to choline-free medium, they initially grow at a rate comparable to their rate of growth in choline-supplemented medium (doubling time, 2.5-3.0 h). However, after five to six generations in the absence of choline, the doubling time of cho2 strains slows to 6 h or longer. Thus, the growth rate we observed for the cho2, cpt1, ept1 strain was similar to the reported sustainable growth rate (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for cho2 strains grown for an extended period of time in the absence of choline. The doubling time of the cho2 strain, DBY746 cho2, in YEPD medium was comparable to the congenic DBY746 wild-type strain (1.5 h). However, the growth rate of the cpt1, ept1, cho2 triple mutant (which is congenic to DBY746 and DBY746 cho2) in YEPD medium was 6.5 h, comparable to its rate of growth in synthetic medium. Moreover, regardless of growth condition, the cells of the triple mutant displayed morphological abnormalities not seen in the DBY746 or DBY746 cho2 strains, including large, elongated cells with multiple buds and a tendency to clump. The triple mutant also generates respiratory-deficient petites at high frequency (25Griac P. Henry S.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. NATO ASI Series: Molecular Dynamics of Biological Membranes. Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Germany1996: 339Google Scholar); a characteristic not observed in the wild type, the cho2, or the cpt1, ept1 congenic strains. In the absence of choline, the cho2, cki1 strain (1-9C) exhibited a doubling time of 6.5 h, comparable to other cho2 strains and the triple mutant, cpt1, ept1, cho2. However, unlike the cpt1, ept1, cho2 strain, the cho2, cki1 strain doubled every 2.7 h when supplemented with choline (Table II), a doubling time comparable to cho2 single mutants growing in the presence of choline.Table II.Phospholipid compositions of wild-type and mutant strainsStrainGenotypeMediumProportion of phospholipids (%)Doubling timePAPIPSPEPMMEPDMEPCOtherhDBY746Wild typeI+C+2.00.824.78.816.51.32.639.06.3DBY746Wild typeI+C−2.01.028.07.822.30.72.331.56.3DBY746cho2I+C+2.50.521.79.524.6NDaND, not detected.ND37.06.8DBY746 cho2cho2I+C−6.00.930.67.047.9NDND7.46.2HJ000cpt1, ept1I+C+2.01.229.28.121.30.40.934.34.8HJ000cpt1, ept1I+C−2.01.427.57.122.60.72.032.56.2HJ000 cho2cpt1, ept1, cho2I+C+6.51.233.95.146.8NDND9.73.2HJ000 cho2cpt1, ept1, cho2I+C−6.51.432.65.544.8NDND10.75.01-9Dcho2I+C+3.00.821.39.422.9NDND36.98.51-9Dcho2I+C+, stationary phase0.421.810.122.0NDND30.615.11-9Ccho2, cki1I+C+2.71.328.77.145.4NDND11.75.81-9Ccho2, cki1I+C+, stationary phase0.123.09.539.2NDND18.010.2a ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The overproduction of inositol (Opi−) phenotype (12Greenberg M.L. Reiner B. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1982; 100: 19-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is indicative of overexpression of inositol-1-phosphate synthase due to misregulation of the INO1 gene. Neither of the wild-type strains used in this study (DBY746 and 1-9A) or the strains carrying mutations in the CDP-choline pathway (HJ000 and 1-9B) displayed an Opi− phenotype, regardless of the presence or absence of choline in the medium. However, the cho2 single mutant strains used in this study (DBY746 cho2 and 1-9D) displayed the Opi− phenotype, but only on media lacking choline, consistent with the previously reported phenotype of cho2 strains (11Summers E.F. Letts V.A. McGraw P. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1988; 120: 909-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those strains with metabolic lesions in both pathways leading to synthesis of PC; i.e. cpt1, ept1, cho2 (HJ000 cho2) and cho2, cki1 (1-9C), displayed an Opi− phenotype regardless of the presence or absence of choline in the medium. However, the size of the Opi− inositol excretion ring was considerably larger for the cpt1, ept1, cho2 strain (HJ000 cho2) compared to the cho2, cki1 strain (1-9C). Mutants with defects in the CDP-choline pathway display lower levels of choline uptake than wild-type cells, but the decreased rate of choline import is apparent only after metabolites of the CDP-choline pathway have accumulated within the cell (18McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28010-28016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed levels of choline uptake in the cpt1, ept1, cho2 triple mutant, in the cpt1, ept1 double mutant, and in the cho2 mutant and compared them to the congenic wild-type strain, DBY746 (Fig. 2). The rate of choline uptake in the strains containing the cpt1 and ept1 mutations, cpt1, ept1 (HJ000) and cpt1, ept1, cho2 (HJ000 cho2), was decreased by about one-half compared to their CPT1, EPT1 counterparts (wild-type (DBY746) or DBY746 cho2 strains, respectively). In contrast, strains carrying the cho2 mutation in the CPT1, EPT1 background (DBY746 cho2) or in combination with the cpt1 and ept1 mutations (HJ001 cho2) had significantly increased uptake of choline when compared to their CHO2 counterparts (i.e. the wild-type strain, DBY746, or the cpt1, ept1 strain, HJ000, respectively; Fig. 2). To determine whether the cki1 mutation or the combination of cpt1 and ept1 mutations could completely prevent synthesis of PC from 14C-labeled choline, mutant strains were grown in defined medium containing 75 μM inositol and 1 mM choline in the presence of 14C-labeled choline and the lipids were then extracted. Incorporation of the label into PC was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incorporation of labeled choline into PC in the cki1 strain (1-9B) occurred at approximately 10% of the level of incorporation observed in the wild-type strain (data not shown). This result is consistent with previous reports that the cki1 mutant retains some limited ability to incorporate choline into PC via the CDP-choline pathway (16Hosaka K. Tsumomu K. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Griac P. Henry S.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. NATO ASI Series: Molecular Dynamics of Biological Membranes. Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Germany1996: 339Google Scholar). In the cho2, cki (1-9C) strain, incorporation of labeled choline into PC was elevated about 5-fold compared to the congenic cki1 strain and was approximately 50% of the level observed in wild-type cells (data not shown), as previously reported (25Griac P. Henry S.A. Op den Kamp J.A.F. NATO ASI Series: Molecular Dynamics of Biological Membranes. Springer- Verlag, Berlin, Germany1996: 339Google Scholar). Strains carrying a combination of the cpt1 and ept1 mutations (i.e. cpt1, ept1 (HJ000) or cpt1, ept1, cho2 (HJ000 cho2)) were both incapable of incorporating any detectable labeled choline into PC (data not shown), confirming that the block in PC biosynthesis via the CDP choline pathway is complete in the cpt1, ept1 double mutant, as reported previously (17Hjelmstad R.H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5094-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18McMaster C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Adaptation motors are thought to employ myosin molecules as their force-producing components. We find that beryllium fluoride, vanadate, and sulfate, phosphate analogs that inhibit the ATPase activity of myosin, inhibit adaptation by abolishing motor force production. Phosphate analogs interact with a 120-kDa bundle protein, most likely myosin Iβ, in a manner that coincides with their effects on adaptation. Features of transduction following inhibition of motor force production suggest that the gating and extent springs of the hair cell orient in parallel at rest and that the negative limit of adaptation arises when force in the stretched extent spring matches the force output of the adaptation motor."

Patients with these mutations have reduced FVIII activity proportional to reduced cross-reacting material in their plasma. It was hypothesized that the reduced levels of FVIII in plasma due to these mutations may be related to a defect in vWF binding with resultant plasma instability. Wild-type and mutant FVIII cDNA expression vectors were prepared and expressed in COS-1 monkey cells by transient DNA transfection. FVIII mutants R2307Q and R2307L were synthesized at equal rates compared to FVIII wild-type but had greater than 10-fold reduced accumulation of antigen and activity levels in the conditioned medium. An additional mutation, Y2305F, also displayed a similar defect in protein accumulation, whereas Y2332F was secreted similarly to wild-type. The specific activity of immunoaffinity purified R2307Q was mildly reduced compared to FVIII wild-type, whereas vWF binding properties were retained. Inhibition of intracellular cysteine proteases resulted in intracellular accumulation of R2307Q protein, suggesting that the mechanism leading to hemophilia A is related to a block in secretion and subsequent degradation within the secretory pathway rather than extracellular instability.

Colorectal cancer is among the most common malignancies of the Western world and is a leading cause of cancer deaths (1Boring C.C. Squires T.S. Tong T. Montgomery S. CA Cancer. J. Clin. 1994; 44: 7-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Advances have been made in the treatment of patients with advanced disease, but they have only had a modest impact on overall survival. Consequently, a need still exists to develop methods for effective treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Passive cancer immunotherapy, using monoclonal or genetically engineered antibodies to deliver radioisotopes to tumor cells, can complement the effect of conventional treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy), and a large number of monoclonal antibodies have already been administered to cancer patients following this approach.

Because of its restricted pattern of expression, the A33 antigen can be classified as a tissue-specific antigen for both normal and transformed colon, rectal, and small intestinal epithelium. Some human colon cancer cell lines express high levels of the A33 antigen, binding up to 800,000 molecules/cell. 2S. Welt, G. Ritter, and L. J. Old, unpublished results. The A33 antigen is not secreted or shed, and cell-bound radiolabeled A33 mAb is rapidly internalized into antigen-positive cells.

However, despite extensive immunochemical, immunohistochemical, and clinical studies, the antigen for the A33 mAb has not previously been identified. Our initial attempts to purify the A33 mAb antigen by immunochromatography were hindered by low yields and leakage of the antibody from the affinity matrix. Furthermore, nonspecific interaction between the Fc domain of the murine A33 mAb and actin was observed. Therefore, a multidimensional chromatographic protocol was developed for the purification of the protein from the human colonic carcinoma cell line LIM1215 (6Whitehead R.H. Macrae F.A. St. John D.J.B. Ma J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1985; 74: 759-765PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses significant levels of A33 antigen, as demonstrated by both immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry analysis. The A33 antigen was extracted from LIM1215 cells by Triton X-114 phase partitioning (7Brusca J.S. Rudolf J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 182-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and purified by sequential use of ligand dye (Green-Sepharose HE-4BD), anion exchange (Mono-Q HR 10/10), size exclusion (Superose 12 HR 10/30), and micropreparative reversed-phase (RP) HPLC (Brownlee Aquapore RP 300; 30 × 2.1- and 100 × 1-mm internal diameter (ID)). The chromatographic purification was monitored by biosensor analysis (8Malmqvist M.

Prestained molecular weight standards were purchased from Bio-Rad and Novex (San Diego, CA). The fluorescein-conjugated anti-murine IgG was purchased from Silenus (Melbourne, Australia). Tween 20, trifluoroacetic acid, and a Micro BCA protein reagent kit were purchased from Pierce. An enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system was purchased from Amersham Corp. Biosensor reagents were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The LIM1215 colonic carcinoma cell line was grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Confluent cells (2.2 × 105/cm2) were passaged using trypsin-Versene solution. Cells were seeded 1/10 into tissue culture dishes (150 × 20 mm; Nuclon, Roskilde, Denmark) containing 25 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.025 unit/ml insulin, and 10.82 μg/ml α-thioglycerol. Dishes were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 5 days. After removing the media, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being removed from the surface using a cell scraper (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 109 cells/ml. A33 antigen expression on the surface of the LIM1215 cell line was analyzed by flow cytometry following standard techniques (10Shapiro H.M. PractblIcal Flow Cytometry. 2nd ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1988Google Scholar). The Hep-2 epidermoid carcinoma cell line (11Moore A.E. Sabachewsky L. Toolan H.W. Cancer Res. 1955; 15: 598-602PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a negative control. The cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in 500 μl of PBS containing 5 mM EDTA and 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated with 5 μg of murine A33 mAb for 30 min at 4°C. After washing with buffer, the cell-antibody complex was incubated with fluorescein-conjugated anti-murine IgG (1/50 dilution). The negative control was performed by staining the cells with an isotypically matched nonrelated antibody (5 μg), followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-murine IgG alone. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). LIM1215 colonic cells (1.6 × 109 cells) were harvested, washed in PBS, and solubilized (108 cells/ml) for 30 min at 4°C with either 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 or 1% (v/v) Triton X-114 in 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM pepstatin, 0.1 mM leupeptin, and 0.01 unit/ml aprotinin. The resulting extracts were centrifuged twice at 4°C for 20 min at 14,000 × g. The Triton X-100-extracted supernatant was taken directly for Green-Sepharose HE-4BD chromatography (see below). The Triton X-114-extracted supernatant was layered over 6% sucrose in 15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.06% (v/v) Triton X-114 and containing the protease inhibitors listed above. The tubes were incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 25°C for 15 min at 5,000 × g. The detergent phase was collected for chromatographic purification. Triton X-100 extract or the Triton X-114 detergent phase was diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% detergent and loaded at 4°C onto a Green-Sepharose HE-4BD column (100 × 10 mm ID) connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. Bound proteins, including actin, were eluted stepwise with 1 M NaCl. The breakthrough contained the A33 antigen and was collected for anion exchange HPLC. The Green-Sepharose breakthrough was injected at 4°C onto a Mono-Q HR 10/10 column previously equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. The proteins were eluted from the column using a linear 0-1 M NaCl gradient generated over 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions (1 ml) were collected automatically (FRAC 100, Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. The A33 antigen in eluant fractions was detected using both biosensor analysis and Western blot analysis under nonreducing conditions, as described below. The active fractions eluted from the Mono-Q column (10 ml) were concentrated 10-fold using a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale, NY), dialyzed against PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS, and loaded at 4°C onto a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. Proteins were eluted with PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) CHAPS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected. Proteins were detected at 280 nm. The A33 antigen was monitored by both Western blot and biosensor analysis. Superose 12 active fractions (2.5 ml) were loaded at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by multiple 1-ml injections onto a Brownlee Aquapore RP 300 micropreparative RP-HPLC column (30 × 2.1 mm ID) equilibrated with the primary solvent, 0.15% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water. The proteins were eluted with a linear 60-min gradient to 60% aqueous n-propyl alcohol/0.125% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, The column temperature was 45°C. Protein detection was performed at 215 nm. The A33 antigen was detected using both biosensor and Western blot analysis. Fractions containing the A33 antigen were repurified and further concentrated using a Brownlee Aquapore RP 300 micropreparative RP-HPLC column (100 × 1 mm ID) prior to N-terminal sequence analysis (12Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Begg G.S. Rubira M.R. Nice E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), using the gradient conditions described above at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Eluant fractions were recovered manually. Cell extracts and chromatographic fractions were monitored using an instrumental optical biosensor (BIAcore™, Pharmacia Biosensor), with an F(ab′)2 fragment of humanized A33 mAb immobilized onto the biosensor surface using N-hydroxysuccinimide and ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl-carbodiimide at a flow rate of 4 μl/min as described previously (13Nice E.

Prior to biosensor assay, cell extracts or aliquots of chromatographic fractions were diluted to 100 μl final volume in BIAcore buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.15 mM NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20). Samples (30 μl) were injected over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Following completion of the injection phase, dissociation was monitored in BIAcore buffer at the same flow rate for 360 s. Residual bound antigen was eluted, and the surface regenerated between injections using 40 μl of 10 mM NaOH. This treatment did not denature the protein immobilized onto the sensor surface, as shown by equivalent signals on reinjection of a sample containing the A33 antigen. Electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed on precast Phastgels using a Phastsystem separation and control unit (Pharmacia Biotech). Cell extracts and chromatographic fractions were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions (14Reid G.E. Hong J. Eddes J.S. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 1120-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) on 8-25% SDS-PAGE Phastgels or 8-25% native Phastgels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated with murine or humanized A33 mAb. RP-HPLC-purified A33 antigen was also analyzed by Western blot under nonreducing and reducing conditions using polyclonal anti-N-terminal peptide antibodies. IgG binding was probed with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-human IgG, or goat anti-rabbit IgG and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified A33 protein was performed on a Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencer operated with the routine 3.0 sequencer program described previously (14Reid G.E.

F(ab′)2 fragments were generated by pepsin (1% w/w) digestion (15Parham P. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2895-2902PubMed Google Scholar) of 10 mg of humanized A33 mAb in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 3.5. F(ab′)2 fragments were purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-200 (2.8 × 60 cm) column (Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mM NaCl. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Antibodies were generated in New Zealand White rabbits using as immunogen a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to part of the N-terminal sequence of the A33 antigen described herein (amino acid residues 2-20) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemeocyanin (Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc., Hopkinton, MA) in complete Freund's adjuvant/incomplete Freund's adjuvant. IgG was purified from immune sera by protein A affinity chromatography. Purified IgG was analyzed for reactivity with LIM1215 cell lysates and purified A33 antigen by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (16Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

The colonic carcinoma cell line LIM12156 was shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 1) and immunocytochemistry and rosetting assays (data not shown) to strongly express the membrane antigen of the A33 mAb. Western blot analysis of a 0.3% Triton X-100 extract of LIM1215 cells under nonreducing conditions using both murine and humanized A33 mAb showed a major band with a Mr of 43,000 (Fig. 2A, lane 1). A Mr 41,000 band was also recognized by Western blot analysis, as well as two other minor lower molecular weight bands (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Western blot analysis of a 0.3% Triton X-100 extract of Hep-2 cells, which were negative for A33 antigen expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 1), failed to demonstrate the Mr 43,000 band but detected both the Mr 41,000 and lower molecular weight bands (results not shown), suggesting that only the Mr 43,000 protein was specifically recognized by the A33 mAb. The A33 mAb recognized a conformationally sensitive epitope, as evidenced by nonreactivity in Western blot analysis under reducing conditions. 3H. Ji, R. L. Moritz, G. B. Reid, G. Ritter, B.

The biosensor technology monitors protein-protein interactions in real time, using an optical detection principle based on surface plasmon resonance (9Liedberg B. Nylander C. Lundstrom I. Sens. Actuators. 1983; 4: 299-304Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar). In these initial experiments the murine A33 mAb was immobilized onto the surface of the sensor chip, whereas antigen-containing fractions were injected in a continuous flow over the surface. The surface plasmon resonance response reflects a change in refractive index, and hence a change in mass, at the detector surface as the antigen binds or dissociates from the immobilized antibody. For the immunochromatographic step, the murine A33 mAb was conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (N-hydroxysuccinimide esters of a derivatized cross-linked agarose). By using this matrix, similar immobilization chemistry was used for both the biosensor analysis and affinity chromatography step, allowing the appropriate dissociation conditions for immunochromatography (10 mM NaOH) to be rapidly determined using biosensor analysis (18Chaiken I. Rose L. Karlsson R. Anal. Chem. 1992; 201: 197-210Google Scholar, 19Nice E. Lackmann M. Smyth F. Fabri L. Burgess A.W. J. Chromatogr. 1994; 660: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A major protein of Mr 43,000 was immunopurified and found to be N-terminally blocked on amino acid microsequence analysis. Internal sequence analysis following “in gel” tryptic digestion (20Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Ji H. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Crabb J.W. in Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 331-339Google Scholar) identified this protein as actin. Further biosensor studies confirmed this in vitro interaction between actin and immobilized A33 mAb. When a preparation of actin was injected over A33 mAb (Fig. 3) or nonrelated monoclonal antibodies of the same immunoglobulin subclass (IgG2a) immobilized onto the biosensor surface, a strong positive binding was observed. By contrast, when A33 F(ab′)2 fragments were immobilized, actin binding was no longer observed, suggesting that actin was binding to the Fc domain of the antibody (Fig. 3). We therefore developed a multidimensional chromatographic protocol for the purification of the A33 mAb ligand. To avoid actin interaction during the screening of the chromatographic fractions, A33 F(ab′)2 fragments were immobilized onto the biosensor surface. Active fractions detected by biosensor analysis were confirmed positive by Western analysis following SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The focus of the initial purification steps was to remove actin, which had been shown to be present in the cell extracts in significant quantities. Studies with Triton X-100 LIM1215 cell lysates showed that actin could be selectively separated from the A33 antigen by Green-Sepharose HE-4BD ligand dye chromatography. The A33 ligand did not bind to the Green-Sepharose matrix (Fig. 2A, lane 2), whereas actin was retained and could be eluted with 1 M NaCl (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Actin, purified from rabbit muscle, was weakly recognized on Western analysis with A33 mAb under nonreducing (a minor band of Mr 41,000; Fig. 2A, lane 4) and reducing conditions (data not shown), confirming the cross-reactivity observed using the biosensor (Fig. 3). Although the Green-Sepharose chromatography was effective for removal of actin, Triton X-114 extraction and phase separation was found to be preferable to Triton X-100 to obtain a detergent phase enriched in hydrophobic membrane proteins (Fig. 2B). The A33 antigen was detected in the Triton X-114 extract (Fig. 2B, lane 1) and in the detergent-rich phase following phase extraction (Fig. 2B, lane 3) but not in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The presence of the A33 antigen in the detergent-rich phase suggested that either the A33 antigen is an integral membrane protein or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (21Low M.G. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The actin band of Mr 41,000 and the other nonspecific low molecular weight components observed with Triton X-100 (Fig. 2A, lane 1) were no longer detected using Triton X-114 extraction. The combination of Triton X-114 phase separation followed by Green Sepharose ligand dye chromatography to remove all traces of actin was therefore used as the primary purification step for the A33 antigen. Injection of Triton X-114 extracts onto humanized A33 mAb immobilized to various chromatographic matrices (Affi-Gel 10, CNBr-activated Sepharose, and N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose) resulted in the recovery of only very low amounts of a Mr 43,000 protein. Furthermore, leakage of significant quantities of antibody from the supports (22Ubrich N. Hubert P. Dellacherie E. Rivat C. J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) hampered the practical use of these methods to purify and identify the antigen. This, coupled with the fact that specific detection (biosensor or Western blot) was also based solely on affinity methods, led us to exclude an affinity step in the purification protocol. The detergent phase of the Triton X-114 LIM1215 cell extracts, after passage through Green-Sepharose HE-4BD, was loaded onto a Mono-Q anion exchange HPLC column. Triton X-114 was exchanged with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS after absorption of the detergent-membrane complex to the chromatographic support. CHAPS was found to greatly improve resolution on both the anion exchange and the subsequent size exclusion chromatography. Application of a 0-1 M NaCl gradient resulted in the elution of at least 15 major protein peaks from the anion exchange column (Fig. 4). A strong biosensor signal (>200 RU) was registered when aliquots of fractions 2-11 were injected over the biosensor surface (Fig. 4). The presence of the Mr 43,000 A33 antigen was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4, inset) in fractions 2-9, eluting between 0.45 and 0.55 M NaCl. The subsequent fractions, eluting between 55 and 68 min, gave a small residual biosensor signal (approximately 100 RU) but were negative by Western blot analysis. The most active Mono-Q fractions (fractions 3-7) were pooled, concentrated 10-fold using a Savant SpeedVac concentrator, and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the Mr 43,000 A33 mAb antigen was detected by both Western blot (Fig. 5, inset A) and biosensor analysis (Fig. 5) in early eluting fractions corresponding, by correlation with the retention time of protein standards of known molecular weight, to an apparent Mr of 160,000-200,000. Western analysis of the pooled Superose 12 active fractions (fractions 2-5), using a 8-25% native Phastgel confirmed this result by revealing a protein migrating under native conditions (in the absence of SDS) with an apparent Mr (23Lasky M. Catsimpoolas N. Electrophoresis 78. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1978: 195Google Scholar) of 180,000 (Fig. 5, inset B).Fig. 5Size exclusion HPLC of the A33 antigen.

We present here direct demonstration in Xenopus oocytes that subunits from distinct eag and Shaker families functionally interact, most likely as heteromultimeric channels. Coexpression with eag accelerates the inactivation and slows the recovery from inactivation of the transient Shaker current. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that the eag carboxyl terminus is crucial for this interaction, exerting effects preferentially on N-type inactivation. Many members of the eag and Shaker families have now been identified and their human homologs implicated in cardiac and neurological disorders.

In this report, we define in greater detail the region that mediates the retinoic acid response of the gene. It consists of two degenerate retinoic acid response elements, separated by 30 nucleotides that encompass a GC-rich Sp1 consensus-like sequence. We demonstrate that the entire region, as well as each element taken singly, can bind the retinoic acid receptors as homo- and heterodimers with low affinity. However, only the entire region is able to confer retinoic acid inducibility to a heterologous promoter. We also show that the correct phasing of the DNA segment is necessary to achieve full responsiveness. Site-directed mutants in each element retained partial induction after transfection, while the double mutant was no longer responsive, suggesting that the two elements act synergistically. Mutational analysis of the Sp1 binding site and cotransfection experiments revealed that Sp1 or a related protein plays an important role in the transcription of the gene. Thus, the retinoic acid induction of the RBP gene is mediated by a novel and complex responsive unit formed by two distinct elements located in a specific sequence context and the interplay of the retinoid receptors with Sp1 is required for induction.

Accordingly, the potential for interaction of cis-elements in FR-α mRNA and trans-factors in these cells was determined. Gel-shift assays identified two signals that were specifically derived from the interaction of cytosolic proteins with the 5′-untranslated region of FR-α mRNA. RNase T1 mapping revealed that the RNA sequences interacting with these proteins were located between nucleotides −133 to −116 (18-bases) and −158 to −116 (43-bases), upstream of the translation start site. However, selective RNase H cleavage indicated that the 18-base RNA sequence was the cis-element. The RNA-protein interaction was competed by poly(C), but not by poly(U), homopolymers. UV cross-linking and Northwestern blot analysis confirmed that the trans-factors were 46-kDa proteins.An 18-base antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the cis-element specifically quenched the RNA-protein interaction and also completely inhibited translation of FR-α mRNA without changing its stability. Thus, the interaction of the 18-base cis-element and the 46-kDa trans-factors likely have an important role in translational regulation of FR.

Transfection of FR-α cDNA into cells which do not constitutively express FR permits cell proliferation in low extracellular folate concentrations (12Luhrs C.A. Raskin C.A. Durbin R. Wu B.

However, when the variable of folate concentration was eliminated by cell culture in high folate media, transduction of FR-α cDNA into cervical carcinoma (HeLa-IU1) cells which constitutively overexpressed FR identified an inverse relationship between FR expression and cell proliferation (15Sun X.L.

These studies highlight yet another role of these glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored FR in constitutive control of cell proliferation. Furthermore, in cells which overexpress FR, these proteins also mediate the uptake of antifolates (16Deutsch J.C. Elwood P.C. Portillo R.M. Macey M.G. Kolhouse J.F. Arch. Biochem.

It is well documented that the expression of FR is inversely regulated by the extracellular folate concentration (20Kane M.A. Elwood P.C. Portillo R.M. Antony A.C. Najfeld V. Finley A. Waxman S.

Chem. 1979; 254: 11312-11318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies on the up-regulation of FR identified that FR mRNA was increased when cells were cultured in low (physiologic) media (5Sadasivan E. Rothenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5806-5811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the increase of FR mRNA was attributed to an increase in FR mRNA stability (22Hsueh C.T. Dolnick B.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 2537-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By contrast, we recently identified 2Q-J. Li, X-L. Sun, and A. C. Antony, manuscript in preparation.that in HeLa-IU1 cells which predominantly express FR-α mRNA, up-regulation of FR by low extracellular folate concentrations was accompanied by a reduction in FR mRNA (23Li Q.-J. Sun X.-L. Antony A.C. J. Invest. Med. 1996; 44 (abstr.): 203AGoogle Scholar). The basis for up-regulation of FR was subsequently identified as being primarily at the translational level involving changes in rates of protein synthesis, with only minor and often apparently paradoxical compensatory changes observed at various other loci within the metabolic pathway of FR (including transcription, mRNA stability, and protein degradation).2 However, details on the underlying molecular mechanisms of translational control of FR regulation remain unclear. In general, post-transcriptional regulation involves the specific interaction of cis-acting sequences contained in the 5′-UTR or 3′-UTR of mature mRNAs with cytoplasmic trans-acting protein factors, i.e. regulatory mRNA-binding proteins which alter the mRNA stability or translation efficiency (see 24McCarthy J.E.G. Kolmus H. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 25Mascotti D.P. Rup D. Thach R.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 239-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, for recent reviews). The best known example is the coordinately regulated cycle for iron uptake and storage generated by the interaction of iron-responsive element-binding proteins with specific iron-responsive elements within the 3′-UTR mRNA of the transferrin receptor and the 5′-UTR of the ferritin mRNA (25Mascotti D.P.

Therefore, to begin to investigate molecular mechanisms that may be involved in translational regulation of FR-α expression in HeLa-IU1 cells in response to alterations in the extracellular concentration of folates, we tested the hypothesis that there were cytosolic protein(s) in these cells which specifically bound to FR-α mRNA. We now report on the identification of a specific 18-base RNA cis-element in the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA which specifically binds a major 46-kDa cytosolic protein from HeLa-IU1 cells. The functional assignment of this interaction has been accomplished by perturbation of the RNA-protein interaction with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to the cis-element that quenches in vitro translation of FR mRNA.

Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, RNase A, RNase T1, RNase H, DNase I (RNase free), proteinase K, the in vitro transcription kit (containing pSPT-18 and pSPT-19 plasmids), the cap analog, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G dilithium salt, and the translation kit (reticulocyte type I) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, IN). Regular and dialyzed fetal calf serum, and other chemicals of the highest analytical grade were from Sigma. Full-length FR-α cDNA inserted in a pUC8 plasmid (4Elwood P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14893-14901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. P. C. Elwood from the National Cancer Institute (Medicine Branch), National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Human GM-CSF cDNA inserted in a pGEM-7Zf(±) vector was kindly provided by Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA (Dr. Y. C. Yang). The DNA sequencing kit (Sequenase™ Version 2.0), [α-32P]UTP, [γ-32P]ATP, [α-32P]CTP (specific activity >800 Ci/mmol), and the [35S]methionine (specific activity > 1000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. All oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Biochemistry-Biotechnology Facility of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN. The antisense oligodeoxynucleotides used in these studies were complementary to different RNA fragments within the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA. Their locations were between bases −133 and −116, −193 and −173, −151 and −134, and −97 and −80 upstream of the FR-α mRNA translational start site. The sequence of these oligodeoxynucleotides were: 5′-CAGGGAGTGGGAATGGAG-3′, 5′-CAGTTAATTATTGTATGTGAG-3′, 5′-CCCAGGAGTGGAGCCTGG-3′, and 5′-AGGGGACAGCTGTGGTTT-3′, respectively. The 1.1-kilobase full-length human FR-α cDNA was subcloned into the pSPT18 vector which was linearized with EcoRI. After determination of the orientation of FR-α cDNA, the multiple cloning sites in the vector were removed by digestion with HindIII and SacI. The resultant plasmid containing FR-α cDNA in the sense orientation in relation to the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter was designated pSPT18-FR (15Sun X.L. Murphy B.R. Li Q.J. Gullapalli S. Mackins J. Jayaram H.N. Srivastava A. Antony A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). By introducing TCGA in the 5′-end of both sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, the 18-base cis-element oligodeoxynucleotide was subcloned into the same vector after linearization with SalI (see “Results”) to construct plasmids pXL27. The orientation of the 18-base sequence in relation to the SP6 RNA polymerase promoter was determined by DNA sequencing. Linearized FR-α cDNA were generated by digestion of pSPT18-FR from 3′→ 5′ with BglI, PstI, BamHI, AvaI, PvuII, MaeI, BanII, and DdeI which gave rise to full-length (BglI) as well as progressively smaller truncated FR-α cDNA of 1108-, 903-, 556-, 356-, 126-, 105-, 80- and 40-base pairs, respectively (Fig. 2A). In vitro transcription was carried out at 37°C for 1 h in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP or [α-32P]CTP and 0.5 mM of the other three unlabeled nucleotides by SP6 RNA polymerase. To prepare full-length antisense FR-α mRNA, the pSPT18-FR was linearized with NaeI and transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase. To prepare the sense or antisense 18-base cis-element RNA fragments, plasmid pXL27 was linearized with EcoRI or HindIII and transcribed by T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase. Full-length human GM-CSF mRNA was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase after digestion of the pGEM-7Zf(±) containing GM-CSF cDNA with EcoRI. For each RNA tested, unlabeled RNA was also synthesized, as described above, in the absence of radioactive nucleotides and used in competition experiments. After transcription, template DNA was digested with DNase I (RNase-free) and RNA transcripts were purified on NucTrap Push columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or by 4% denaturing urea PAGE (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. J. Biol. Chem.Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In all instances, a single RNA band of the appropriate size was resolved on denaturing PAGE or 2% agarose gels. To prepare RNA molecular size markers, pSPT-18 was linearized with PstI, and pSPT-19 was linearized with SalI, and transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. The transcribed RNA of the PstI digested pSPT-18 was 18 bases while the RNA from SalI digested pSPT-19 was 43 bases. All cells were cultured in 10% fetal calf serum at 37°C in 5% CO2 in the following media: HeLa-IU1 (15Sun X.L. Murphy B.R. Li Q.J. Gullapalli S. Mackins J. Jayaram H.N. Srivastava A. Antony A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and MDA-435 cells in minimal essential medium, COS cells in D-minimal essential medium, HL-60 cells, HEL cells, and KG-1 cells in RPMI 1640. Cells were washed in 5 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min at 22°C in a Beckman GPR table-top centrifuge) before cytosolic protein extracts from 5 × 107 cells were prepared at 4°C (29Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in 5 packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)) for 10 min. They were then centrifuged, resuspended in 2 packed cell volumes of buffer A, and lysed by 10 strokes of a Kontes all glass Dounce homogenizer (B type pestle). After confirming cell lysis and recentrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C), the supernatant was mixed with 0.11 volumes of buffer B (300 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 30 mM MgCl2, 1.4 M KCl), and centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g (Beckman Type SW 55.Ti rotor). The supernatant was recovered and dialyzed for 8 h against 20 volumes of buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, containing 100 mM KCl, 200 μM EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 500 μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 μM DTT), 100-μl aliquots were frozen at −80°C (S-100 fraction). RNA-protein binding reactions and electrophoresis of complexes were performed using the method of Leibold and Munro (29Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The various RNAs used in these reactions were either generated from in vitro transcription of full-length FR-α cDNA, progressively truncated FR-α cDNAs, antisense FR-α cDNA, and sense/antisense 18-base cis-elements, or eluted from RNA-protein complexes after gel-shift assays. Briefly, binding reactions were carried out with indicated amounts of cytosolic extracts and 1-2 × 104 cpm (1 to 2 ng) of 32P-labeled FR-α mRNA in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, containing 3 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 600 ng/μl yeast tRNA, 1 mM DTT in a final volume of 10-15 μl. After incubation at either 4°C or 30°C for 20 min, 20 units of RNase T1 and 5 mg of heparin/ml were added and incubation was continued for another 20 min. In some experiments, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml to the binding reaction. For competition experiments, 32P-labeled RNA probes were mixed first with different amounts of unlabeled FR-α mRNA or GM-CSF mRNA before addition of cytosolic extracts. For assays involving RNase H-mediated cleavage, various amounts of antisense oligodeoxynucleotide were mixed with RNA probes followed by the addition of 0.5 units of RNase H before initiation of the RNA-protein binding reaction. Electrophoresis of RNA-protein complexes was carried out using native PAGE and dried gels were autoradiographed at −80°C. After native PAGE, gels were exposed to x-ray film to identify the RNA-protein complexes which were then cut out. The “crush and soak” method (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. J. Biol. Chem.Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used to isolate 32P-labeled RNA fragments which were dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to give 600-1000 cpm/μl. For RNase T1 mapping, the 32P-labeled FR-α mRNA fragments as well as the eluted RNA fragments were incubated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA, and 10 units of RNase T1 for 30 min at 37°C. The samples were analyzed on 18% PAGE using 8 M urea as the denaturant followed by autoradiography. Mr was estimated using 32P-labeled RNA standards. 32P-Labeled FR-α mRNA fragments (10 ng) and cytosolic proteins (40 μg) in 15 μl were incubated at 30°C for 20 min followed by treatment with RNase T1 and heparin, as described above. In some experiments, 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K, 0.3 mg/ml RNase A, or 20-80 ng of antisense oligomers (18- or 21-bases) with 0.5 units of RNase H were added to the reaction mixture before cross-linking. The mixtures were transferred to 96-well plates and irradiated from a distance of 1 cm by a UV lamp (300 nm, 70,000 μW/cm2, Fotodyne Inc., New Berlin, WI) for 30 min at 4°C before SDS-PAGE (29Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts, 90 μg, were boiled for 5 min and then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting and Northwestern blot analysis (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. J. Biol. Chem.Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 30Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I.M. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose filter in 48 mM of Tris base, 39 mM glycine, and 20% methanol at 200 mA overnight. The filters were then preincubated in Northwestern blot binding buffer (buffer D, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 × Denhardt's solution in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water) containing 1 mg of heparin/ml and 1 mM DTT at 22°C for 1 h. After washing with 50 ml of buffer D with 1 mM DTT and 20 μg of tRNA/ml, the filters were probed with 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA probes per ml in 30 ml of buffer D with 20 μg of tRNA per ml and 1 mM DTT at 22°C for 1 h. After washing twice in 30 ml of buffer D with 20 μg of tRNA per ml for 5 min, the filters were subjected to autoradiography using Kodak X-Omat LS x-ray film. For in vitro translation, the full-length FR-α mRNA was synthesized in the presence of 2.5 μl of 5 mM of the cap analog, m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G. One μg of complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were hybridized with either 0.2 μg of FR-α mRNA (31Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 32Chakrabarti R. Chakrabarti D. Souba W.W. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1298-1303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with 0.4 μg of control TMV RNA. Translation was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 30 μCi of [35S]methionine. After incubation, one-half of the sample was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The remainder was used to isolate mRNA using TRIzol Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA secondary structures were generated using the programs MulFold and LoopViewer (33Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 34Tian Y. Adya N. Wagner S. Giam C.-Z. Green M.R. Ellington A.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 317-326PubMed Google Scholar). When 32P-labeled full-length FR-α mRNA was incubated with cytosolic proteins (the S-100 fraction) from HeLa-IU1 cells followed by RNase T1 digestion (which cleaves single-stranded RNA after G residues), two RNA-protein complexes were observed on gel-shift assays (Fig. 1A, lane 2) compared to the control (lane 1); these RNA-protein complexes are referred to as Complex I and Complex II hereafter. The FR-α mRNA-protein interaction was specific since increasing amounts of unlabeled FR-α mRNA (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6) led to progressive quenching of both RNA-protein complexes; however, unlabeled GM-CSF mRNA had no effect (lanes 8-10). The dose-dependence of the observed FR-α mRNA-protein interaction was also demonstrated in results where the addition of increasing amounts of cytosolic extracts led to the generation of progressively stronger signals of Complex I and II (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-5). In addition, in the presence of proteinase K, the signals were abrogated indicating the dependence of complex formation on cytosolic proteins (Fig. 1B, lane 6). However, when the RNA-protein binding assay was carried out at 4°C, the results were the same as at 30°C (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting the lack of temperature dependence. And when the FR-α mRNA transcripts were incubated with RNase T1 for 20 min at 30°C before addition of cytosolic extracts followed by 20 min of incubation at 30°C, both Complexes I and II were observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 4-6). These results suggested that the RNA-protein interaction occurred within a region of RNA which either did not contain G residues or that the interaction involved a G residue(s) within the RNA which was protected by its secondary structure. To localize the minimum domain in FR-α mRNA which could form RNA-protein complexes, progressively truncated (3′→ 5′) 32P-labeled FR-α mRNAs were generated by digestion of FR-α cDNA with various restriction endonucleases (Fig. 2A). Subsequent gel-shift assays using these mRNAs revealed both Complex I and II even with truncations extending into the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA up to the MaeI site (Fig. 2, B, lanes 2-5, and C, lanes 2 and 4). In addition, full-length antisense FR-α mRNA did not exhibit a signal (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6), while GM-CSF mRNA bound a cytosolic moiety which was apparently of a larger Mr (Fig. 2C, lane 8). These results suggested that the specific domain which gave rise to Complex I and II was in the 5′-UTR of sense FR-α mRNA. However, when radiolabeled FR-α mRNA generated from BanII- and DdeI-digested FR-α cDNA were used, the two complexes disappeared (Fig. 2D, lanes 2, 4, 8, and 10); as a positive control, the radiolabeled FR-α mRNA fragment from MaeI-digested FR-α cDNA resulted in a smear like shift (lane 6) which resolved into 2 bands after digestion with RNase T1 (lane 12). Thus, these results strongly suggested that portions of the cis-element of FR-α mRNA which gave rise to the RNA-protein complexes were located within the region between the sites of MaeI and BanII in FR-α cDNA. To confirm data from Fig. 2D regarding the likely location of the cis-element, we generated 32P-labeled FR-α mRNA fragments (from MaeI-digested FR-α cDNA) which migrated as a single band (Fig. 3A, lane 1) on denaturing (urea) PAGE, but which yielded four major bands and five minor bands after digestion with RNase T1 (lane 2). Based on Mr marker estimates, analysis of the eluted RNA fragments from Complex I revealed that they were composed of a major 43-base and a minor 18-base FR-α mRNA fragment (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In contrast, the eluted RNA fragments from the slower migrating Complex II were paradoxically composed of a major 18-base and a minor 43-base FR-α mRNA fragment (lane 4). Both of these RNA fragments were resistant to further digestion by RNase T1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). In addition, both lanes also contained another RNA fragment composed of ∼30 nucleotides. (These data were consistently noted in three separate experiments). When the sequence of the 105-bases within the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA fragment (from the MaeI-digested cDNA fragment; see Fig. 2A) was scrutinized for G-free domains, only an 18-base fragment was present in the region between the MaeI site and BanII site in the 5′-UTR of FR-α mRNA (Fig. 3 B, underlined letters). However, no G-free RNA fragments that were 43-base or ∼30-base were identified. These data suggested that these 43-base and ∼30-base RNA fragments were likely protected from RNase T1 digestion by its secondary structure. To explore this possibility further, secondary structure analysis of this region of RNA was carried out. These results (Fig. 3, C and D) suggested that there were two potential secondary structures with stem-loop configurations, one consisting of a 43-base fragment in which the 18-base cis-element was outside the stem-loop structure (Fig. 3C) and another consisting of 31 bases in which the 18-base region was within the stem-loop structure (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data strongly suggested that the RNA fragment involved in the formation of Complex I was the 43-base RNA fragment, and the putative RNA fragment involved in the formation of Complex II was the 18-base cis-element. Because RNase H specifically cleaves RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids (35Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ratnasabapathy R. Hwang S.-P.L. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14050-14055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), experiments were conducted to confirm that the RNA sequence involved in the formation of Complex I and II was the 18-base G-free domain. This was accomplished by selective RNase H cleavage of the RNA in the RNA:DNA hybrids following the addition of an 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide that was complementary to this 18-base RNA fragment. Furthermore, we hypothesized that if the 18-base RNA fragment was involved in the formation of both Complex I and II, selective RNase H-mediated cleavage using the 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide would quench the generation of both complexes. The results (Fig. 4) confirmed these predictions. Thus, addition of 1.2 to 10 ng of 18-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the formation of both Complex I and II (Fig. 4, lanes 3-7). However, addition of a 21-mer antisense oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to bases −193 to −173 of FR-α mRNA (in a region within the 105 base 5′-UTR sequence that contained no G residues; a 21-base RNA fragment) did not affect RNA-protein complex formation (Fig. 4, lanes 8-10). These results indicated that the 18-base domain of FR-α mRNA identified by the RNase T1 mapping was the cis-element that was responsible for the formation of both Complex I and II. Next, we determined if the RNA from Complexes I and II could be separated and reused to reconstitute these RNA-protein complexes. Accordingly, RNA fragments eluted from these complexes were allowed to bind"

In vitro binding indicated a similar binding affinity of SOS for all three adapter proteins but with a slightly lower Kd for Grb2 (∼2.5-fold) compared with Nck and CrkII. Insulin stimulation resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 with Grb2 and to a lesser extent CrkII. Although Grb2 also associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, there was no detectable interaction of CrkII with Shc. In contrast, EGF stimulation resulted in the predominant co-immunoprecipitation of Grb2 with the EGF receptor, whereas CrkII primarily associated with an unidentified 120-130-kDa protein. Similar to the ability of insulin to induce the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, there was a concomitant time-dependent dissociation of the CrkII-SOS and Nck-SOS complexes. However, EGF stimulation had no effect on the association state of the Grb2-SOS or the Nck-SOS complexes but did result in a time-dependent dissociation of the CrkII from SOS. Together, these data demonstrate that different cellular pools of SOS associate with different adapter proteins forming various signaling complexes, each undergoing distinct patterns of assembly/disassembly following growth factor stimulation.

Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin treatment results in a feedback serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS, which directly correlates with the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (24Waters S.B.

Furthermore, inhibition of this feedback phosphorylation of SOS preserves the interaction between Grb2 and SOS and prolongs the time that Ras remains in the active GTP-bound state (16Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.J. Guan L-K. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20883-20886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 17Langlois W.J.

Although EGF stimulation also induces a serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS and a transient activation of Ras, there is no dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (19Klarlund J.K. Cherniack A.D.

In contrast, EGF apparently induces a dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex from tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc (27Rozakis-Adcock M. van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T.

Thus, although the disruption of the Shc-Grb2-SOS complex appears to be one mechanism that may be partially responsible for the inactivation phase of Ras following growth factor stimulation, insulin and EGF utilize different molecular pathways to accomplish the uncoupling of the Grb2-SOS activation signal. However, recent studies have also demonstrated that in addition to Grb2 other small adapter proteins including Nck and CrkII, through their respective SH3 domains, also associate with the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of SOS (29Hu Q.

Together these data provide direct evidence suggesting that alternative pathways to Grb2 may also contribute to SOS-mediated Ras activation. To examine the interactions between Grb2-SOS with that of the Nck-SOS and CrkII-SOS complexes during the Ras inactivation phase following growth factor stimulation, we have determined the effects of insulin and EGF to regulate the association state of SOS with these adapter proteins. The data presented in this study demonstrate that although EGF does not induce the dissociation of either Grb2 or Nck from SOS, EGF is fully capable of dissociating the CrkII-SOS complex. Thus, these results suggest that in addition to the Grb2-SOS complex, the CrkII-SOS complex is involved in the EGF regulation of the Ras activation/inactivation cycle. CHO cells expressing both the human insulin and EGF receptors were obtained as described previously (35Okada S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20737-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These cells were maintained in minimal Eagle's medium containing nucleotides plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were grown to confluence and incubated in serum-free medium for 8 h prior to the addition of 100 nM insulin or 20 nM EGF at 37°C for the times indicated in the figure legends. Whole cell extracts were prepared by detergent solubilization in a lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μM leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1.5 μM pepstatin) for 1 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were performed by dilution of the detergent-solubilized cell extracts 10-fold in lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and incubation with 4 μg of an SOS polyclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), Grb2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), CrkII polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), or Nck monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 4°C. The samples were then incubated with protein A-Sepharose or protein G(+)-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotted (enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit, Amersham Corp.) using the SOS, Grb2, CrkII, Nck, or PY20-HRP phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories) as indicated in the individual figure legends. GST-Nck and GST-CrkII cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. Lewis T. Williams (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and Dr. Bruce Mayer (The Children's Hospital, Boston, MA), respectively. The GST-Grb2 cDNA was obtained as described previously (24Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). All three fusion proteins were isolated and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl bed volume). The glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-fusion proteins were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with whole cell lysates (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 2 μM pepstatin, 0.5 trypsin inhibitory units of aprotinin, and 10 μM leupeptin) isolated from the CHO/IR/ER cells. The Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. The amount of SOS associated with the immobilized GST-fusions protein was determined by immunoblotting with an SOS antibody. Quantification of signal intensity was performed in the linear range of the film using NIH Image version 1.5 software. Previous studies have demonstrated that SOS can form complexes with the small adapter proteins Grb2, Nck, and CrkII (8Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullich A.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5495-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To estimate the relative binding affinities of SOS for these different adapters, we compared the binding of SOS to GST-Grb2, GST-Nck, and GST-CrkII fusion proteins in vitro (Fig. 1). Incubation of CHO/IR/ER cell extracts with various concentrations (1-100 μg) of GST-Grb2 demonstrated a dose-dependent and saturatable binding of SOS (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-6). Similarly, incubations of cell extracts with different amounts of GST-Nck also resulted in the saturatable binding of SOS (Fig. 1A, lanes 7-12). However, the apparent affinity of SOS for GST-Grb2 was somewhat greater than for GST-Nck, which was particularly evident at the lower concentrations of the fusion proteins (e.g. compare lane 1 with lane 7 and lane 2 with lane 8). In an analogous manner, GST-CrkII was also observed to specifically bind SOS from the CHO/IR/ER cell extracts with a reduced affinity compared with GST-Grb2 (Fig. 1B). Transformation of these data into a saturation binding curve indicated that GST-Grb2 had an approximate 2.5-fold greater binding affinity compared with both GST-Nck and GST-CrkII (data not shown). It has been well documented that the SH3 domains of Grb2, Nck, and CrkII are responsible for the basal state association with the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of SOS (8Lowenstein E.J.

However, in addition to the SH3 domains, these adapter proteins also contain SH2 domains for interaction with various phosphotyrosine docking sites (37Songtang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge B.R. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar). To identify the phosphotyrosine docking proteins that are associated with Grb2 and CrkII in vivo, the CHO/IR/ER cells were incubated in the absence or presence of either 100 nM insulin or 20 nM EGF for 30 min at 37°C. Whole cell detergent extracts were then prepared and immunoprecipitated with either a Grb2 or a CrkII antibody (Fig. 2). As expected, phosphotyrosine immunoblots of whole cell extracts demonstrated the specific insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and the insulin receptor β subunit (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, EGF stimulation resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and an approximately 120-130-kDa protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). Immunoprecipitation of Grb2 followed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of extracts from insulin-stimulated cells resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of IRS1 and the 52-kDa Shc isoform (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5). EGF stimulation resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of Grb2 with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor and both the 52- and 46-kDa Shc isoforms (Fig. 2, lane 6). Consistent with these data, the 52-kDa Shc isoform has been reported to be a significantly better substrate for the insulin receptor kinase than the 46-kDa species, whereas the EGF receptor can effectively tyrosine-phosphorylate these two Shc isoforms equally well (35Okada S. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20737-20741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to Grb2, insulin stimulation resulted in a smaller amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS1 associated with CrkII (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). In addition, there was no detectable association of CrkII with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins. Similarly, EGF stimulation resulted in a lesser extent of CrkII association with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor (Fig. 2, lane 9). However, CrkII was predominantly bound to a 120-130-kDa EGF-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that is probably either p120 c-Cbl or p130cas (38Ribon V. Hubbell S. Herrera R. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition, CrkII itself appeared to undergo a small degree of tyrosine phosphorylation following both insulin and EGF stimulation, consistent with a recent study demonstrating an insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated CrkII tyrosine phosphorylation (40Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We were unable to perform a similar analysis with our Nck antibody, since it was found to interfere with the ability of Nck to interact with other effector proteins. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that although both Grb2 and CrkII bind to SOS, they apparently adapt SOS to different subsets of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in either insulin- or EGF-stimulated cells. Since Grb2 and CrkII associate with an overlapping subset of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, we next examined the potential formation of multisubunit complexes containing both Grb2 and CrkII (Fig. 3). In the basal state, a small amount of Grb2 was detected in the CrkII immunoprecipitate, which was not significantly affected by insulin stimulation (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, EGF stimulation for 30 min resulted in an increased amount of Grb2 that was co-immunoprecipitated with the CrkII antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 3). This was not due to differences in CrkII immunoprecipitation, since equivalent amounts of CrkII protein were present under these conditions (Fig. 3A, lanes 4-6). It should be noted that we typically detect a strong immunoreactivity for the established 40-kDa CrkII protein and a weak signal from a 42-kDa band that cross-reacts with the CrkII antibody. In any case, to confirm these findings we also examined the ability of the Grb2 antibody to co-immunoprecipitate CrkII (Fig. 3B). Although CrkII was also detected in the Grb2 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells, again insulin had no effect (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). However, following EGF stimulation there was a significant increase in the amount of Grb2 immunoprecipitated CrkII proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 3). As controls, equivalent amounts of Grb2 protein were immunoprecipitated by the Grb2 antibody as detected by Grb2 immunoblotting (Fig. 3B, lanes 4-6). These data suggest that multisubunit complexes are formed following EGF stimulation, which simultaneously contain both Grb2 and CrkII. We and others have recently reported that insulin stimulation results in a time-dependent serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS concomitant with a dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex (24Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Cherniack A.D. Klarlund J.K. Conway B.R. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

However, although EGF stimulation also results in a serine/threonine phosphorylation of SOS, the Grb2-SOS complex remains stably associated (18Waters S.B. Chen D. Kao A.W. Okada S. Holt K.H.

To document this observation under the same experimental conditions, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation using cell extracts from control, insulin-, and EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4). Immunoblotting of cell extracts with a Grb2 antibody demonstrated identical levels of Grb2 protein in untreated or cells stimulated with 100 nM insulin or 20 nM EGF for 30 min (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). As expected, immunoprecipitation of SOS from control cell extracts resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of Grb2 (Fig. 4A, lane 4), whereas following insulin stimulation there was a significant reduction in the amount of Grb2 protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with the SOS antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 5). In contrast to insulin, EGF stimulation did not significantly decrease the ability of the SOS antibody to co-immunoprecipitate Grb2 (Fig. 4A, lane 6). To ensure that equal amounts of the SOS protein were immunoprecipitated, the SOS immunoprecipitates were subjected to SOS immunoblotting (Fig. 4A, lanes 7-9). It should be noted that the small decrease in mobility of the SOS protein from the insulin and EGF-stimulated cells was characteristic of serine/threonine phosphorylation (24Waters S.B. Yamauchi K.

To further document the ability of insulin but not EGF to induce the dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex, a similar analysis was performed using a Grb2 antibody to co-immunoprecipitate the SOS protein (Fig. 4B). SOS immunoblots demonstrated approximately equivalent amounts of SOS protein in the extracts from unstimulated, insulin-stimulated, and EGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-3). Immunoprecipitation with a Grb2 antibody resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of SOS protein but which was markedly reduced in the extracts from the insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 4 and 5). As observed in the SOS immunoprecipitates, EGF stimulation had no significant effect on the ability of the Grb2 antibody to co-immunoprecipitate the SOS protein (Fig. 4B, lane 6).

https://openalex.org/W2064814056,"The extracellular accumulation of ATP after activation of T-lymphocytes, as well as the presence of ecto-protein kinases in these cells, led us to propose that T cell surface receptors could be regulated through the reversible phosphorylation of their extracellular domains (ectodomains). Here, in a model system, we used T cell transfectants which express T cell antigen receptor chains lacking intracellular and transmembrane protein domains and 32Pi metabolic labeling of cells to definitively demonstrate phosphorylation of ectodomains of T cell surface proteins. We show that αβTCR ectodomains were phosphorylated intracellularly and constitutively on serine and threonine residues and were then expressed on the T cell surface in phosphorylated form. TCR ectodomains also could be phosphorylated at the cell surface when extracellular [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP were used as phosphate donors with the same cells. Consensus phosphorylation sites for serine and threonine protein kinases were found to be strongly evolutionary conserved in both α and β TCR chains constant regions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis, where T cell surface proteins which are phosphorylated intracellularly on their ectodomains, could subsequently be expressed at the cell surface and then be reversibly modified by ectoprotein phosphatase(s) and by ectokinase(s). Such modifications may change T cells cognate interactions by, e.g. affecting TCR-multimolecular complex formation and antigen binding affinity. It is suggested that αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation could serve as a potential mechanism for regulation of αβTCR-mediated T-lymphocytes response. The extracellular accumulation of ATP after activation of T-lymphocytes, as well as the presence of ecto-protein kinases in these cells, led us to propose that T cell surface receptors could be regulated through the reversible phosphorylation of their extracellular domains (ectodomains).

We show that αβTCR ectodomains were phosphorylated intracellularly and constitutively on serine and threonine residues and were then expressed on the T cell surface in phosphorylated form. TCR ectodomains also could be phosphorylated at the cell surface when extracellular [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP were used as phosphate donors with the same cells. Consensus phosphorylation sites for serine and threonine protein kinases were found to be strongly evolutionary conserved in both α and β TCR chains constant regions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis, where T cell surface proteins which are phosphorylated intracellularly on their ectodomains, could subsequently be expressed at the cell surface and then be reversibly modified by ectoprotein phosphatase(s) and by ectokinase(s). Such modifications may change T cells cognate interactions by, e.g. affecting TCR-multimolecular complex formation and antigen binding affinity. It is suggested that αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation could serve as a potential mechanism for regulation of αβTCR-mediated T-lymphocytes response. T cell differentiation and effector functions involve multiple cell-cell contacts and interactions that are mediated by cell surface-located recognition structures, cell adhesion molecules, and growth factor receptors.

In addition, extracellular domains of cell surface proteins are involved in multimolecular complex formation as underscored by studies of TCR/CD3 subunit assembly (3Wileman T. Kane L.P. Young J. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and of CD4-TCR interactions that contribute to TCR recognition of MHC class II-presented peptides (4Vignali D.A. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1945-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated recently that CD45 ectodomains regulate CD4-αβTCR associations (5Lautenberg D. Novak T. Farber D. Smith B. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 183: 249-259Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These considerations and our earlier studies of the role of extracellular ATP in T cell effector functions (6Filippini A. Taffs R.E. Agui T. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 334-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) led us to propose that properties of T cell surface receptors, including cell adhesion proteins and recognition molecules, could be regulated through phosphorylation of their extracellular domains (7Redegeld F. Filippini A. Sitkovsky M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3638-3645PubMed Google Scholar, 8Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in a manner now accepted as a mechanism for regulation of enzyme-substrate interactions (9Krebs E.G. Biosci. Rep. 1993; 113: 127-142Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The precedent for such a mechanism was recently provided by studies of CD36 on the platelets surface. It was demonstrated that the specificity of that receptor for collagen or thrombospondin is regulated by ectophosphorylation of its ectodomain (10Asch A.S. Liu I. Briccetti F.M. Barnwell J.W. Kwakye-Berko F. Dokun A. Goldberger J. Pernambuco M. Science. 1993; 262: 1436-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Analysis of published amino acid sequences of lymphocyte surface proteins (data not shown) revealed the presence of consensus protein kinase phosphorylation sites in the extracellular domains of the majority of functionally important surface proteins, including αβTCR. αβTCR was also found to be ectophosphorylated by extracellular [γ-32P]ATP during preliminary screening of immunoprecipitates of T cell surface proteins with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (8Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 2S. G. Apasov and M. V. Sitkovsky, unpublished observations. This suggested that αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation could affect antigen recognition and/or interactions of αβTCR molecules with ectodomains of other functionally important molecules (e.g. CD4/CD8, CD3, or CD45) and thereby regulate T cell cognate interactions and effector functions (8Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The unambiguous demonstration of T cell surface proteins ectodomain phosphorylation is an important requirement for the further testing of this hypothesis since the studies of extracellular protein kinases (ectokinases) in other cellular systems (11Ehrlich Y.H. Science. 1996; 271: 278-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 12Walter J. Schnölzer M. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. Kubler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were not complemented by definitive description of their cell surface substrates due to known caveats of ectophosphorylation assays using extracellular [γ-32P]ATP (13Skubitz K.M. Goueli S.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5902-5911PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we provide the first direct evidence of the T cell surface protein (αβTCR) ectodomain phosphorylation. This was done by using T cell transfectants that express the recombinant intracellular tail and transmembrane domain-lacking αβTCR molecules after the long-term metabolic 32Pi labeling. The extracellular domains of αβTCR cloned from the anti-H-2Ld cytolytic clone, 2C were expressed as phosphatidylinositol-linked molecules on transfected BW 5147 lymphoma cells (14Slanetz A.E. Bothwell A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and released from the cell surface using phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (PLC, Sigma). The 2C-TCR transfectants were maintained in AMEM media (Biofluids, Rockville, MD), releasable 2C-TCR and soluble MHC class I molecules (sH-2Ld) were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (15Corr M. Slanetz A.E. Boyd L.F. Jelonek M.T. Khilko S. al-Ramadi B.K. Kim Y.S. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L. Margulies D.H. Science. 1994; 265: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). 2B4 T helper hybridoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with standard supplement and 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). Thymocyte clone 4F7 was established by limiting dilution from spontaneous thymoma formed in p53KO mice and maintained as 2B4 cells. 3S. Apasov, unpublished observations. Normal thymocytes and lymph node cells were isolated from DBA/2 mice using standard procedures. mAb 1B2 (16Kranz D.M. Tonegawa S. Eisen H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7922-7926Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), directed against the antigen combining site of the cloned 2C-TCR were purified using protein A-Sepharose chromatography. Purified H57-597 hamster mAb against the common epitope of mouse TCRβ chain were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). All binding experiments were performed at 25°C using Pharmacia BIAcore™ (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (15Corr M. Slanetz A.E. Boyd L.F. Jelonek M.T. Khilko S. al-Ramadi B.K. Kim Y.S. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L. Margulies D.H. Science. 1994; 265: 946-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, the soluble 2C-TCR was diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate at pH 4.6 and was coupled to the biosensor surface with standard amine coupling. Binding abilities of chemically immobilized 2C-TCR were determined by using soluble H-2Ld MHC class I molecules containing bound endogenous peptides (no added peptide) or complexed with the specific p2Ca (LSPFPFDL) or pMCMV (YPHFMPTNL), nonspecific control peptides. All peptides were synthesized at the Laboratory of Molecular and Structural Biology (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health) and are referred to by single-letter code. 125Iodine labeling of cell surface molecules was done by slight modification of the standard lactoperoxidase method (17Samelson L.E. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Vol 2. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 8.11.1Google Scholar) using 20 mMβ-D-(+)glucose (Sigma), 1 mCi/ml Na125I (Amersham), and 10,000 units/ml lactoperoxidase (Worthington, Freehold, NJ), 1:400 (v/v) dilution of glucose oxidase (Sigma). [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP ectophosphorylation was achieved by a 10-min incubation of intact cells at 37°C in the buffer containing Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4), 1 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP (3000 mmol/mCi; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) per 107 cells. [32P]Orthophosphate labeling was done after washing cells twice with phosphate-free media containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and standard supplement. Cells were then resuspended at concentration 3 × 106 cells/ml with 1 mCi of high activity [32P]inorganic phosphate (50 μCi/μl) (ICN) and were incubated overnight (14-16 h) at 37°C in 7% CO2 or for 1-6 h when indicated. Acid phosphatase (Sigma) was dialyzed against Hanks' balanced salt solution before experiment and pretested for its phosphatase activity. Cells were incubated with or without (control) 200 units/ml of purified preparations of acid phosphatases 10 min, 37°C at pH 7.1 in conditions shown to be both sufficient for the demonstration of enzymatic activity of acid phosphatase and for maintenance of the cell viability during the treatment. Phosphatase-pretreated cells were used in ectophosphorylation assay as described above. Labeled cells were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI 1640 with standard supplement and 100 nM phosphatase inhibitor microcystin LR (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The cell suspension (10-20 × 106/ml) was incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h in T-80 flasks (15-20 ml) in the presence of 0.25-0.5 units/ml of phospholipase C (Sigma). In some experiments, 10 × 107 cells/ml were treated with 1 unit/ml of phospholipase C for 2 h at 37°C. The supernatants of PLC-treated cells were harvested, precleared by centrifugation and by incubation with protein A- or G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C before immunoprecipitation. Control for efficiency and specificity of PLC treatment was monitored by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described below. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on FACScan using the CellQuest program after standard cell staining in microplates as described before (18Apasov S. Sitkovsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2837-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated hamster anti-mouse αβTCR (H57-597) and rat anti-mouse CD44 (IM7) mAbs were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Cell lysate was prepared with buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 (Pierce, Rockford, IL), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, 0.4 mM orthovanadate, and 10 mM sodium fluoride (all from Sigma), and 2 mM Pefablock SC from Boehringer Mannheim. Purified mAbs were preabsorbed on protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia) (20 μg of antibody per 50 μl of 50% Sepharose gel) by incubation for 2 h or overnight at 4°C. Precipitation of immunocomplexes was done by 2 h incubation of mAb-precoated Sepharose with cell lysates or supernatants of PLC-treated cells. Immunoprecipitates were washed 4-6 times with lysis buffer, than were boiled with SDS sample buffer and eluted immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions using the standard Laemmli method and 4-20% gradient minigel system electrophoresis (Integrated Separation System, Natick, MA). 14C-Labeled standard markers (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) were used to identify molecular weights of phosphoproteins. After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using X-Omat AR or BIOMAX MS film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out according to the standard method (19Siegel J.N. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.D.M. Shevach E. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Vol 3. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 11.2.4Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE-separated proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and after overnight autoradiography, phosphoprotein bands were excised and hydrolyzed in boiling 5.7 N HCl at 110°C for 60 min. The samples were dried in a Speed-Vac Concentrator (Savant, Hicksville, NY), dissolved in the buffer mixed with unlabeled phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine (Sigma) and subjected to two-directional electrophoresis (pH 1.9 and 3.5) on TLC plates (Uniplate™ Avicell, Analtech Inc., Newark, DE). No Thr-phosphorylation sites and only one possible Ser-phosphorylation site were found in the amino acid sequence of Thy-1-derived region (14Slanetz A.E. Bothwell A.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) of chimeric 2C-TCR molecules. In preliminary experiments, under conditions that favor phosphorylation of ectodomains rather than intracellular sites (20Naik U.P. Kornecki E. Ehrlich Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we observed that TCR, CD45, and HSA proteins expressed on the cell surface of living cells were phosphorylated during short incubation with extracellular [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). However, such assays could be misleading, despite extensive controls (13Skubitz K.M. Goueli S.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5902-5911PubMed Google Scholar), and we developed new and more stringent criteria to unambiguously demonstrate phosphorylation of the extracellular domains of such surface proteins. We focused our studies on the αβTCR due to its key role in T cell activation as well as because of the availability of cellular and molecular reagents that allow critical controls. First we examined transfectant T cells expressing recombinant GPI-anchored αβTCR molecules from 2C cytolytic T cell clone (Fig. 1). For such a protein, phosphorylation can only occur on the extracellular part of the molecules allowing localization to the ectodomain. The release of the TCR by PLC treatment provides additional assurance that we are examining only cell surface expressed molecules. Specific removal of GPI-linked TCR molecules from the cell surface was confirmed by flow cytometry and 125I-surface labeling. The treatment of 2C-TCR cells with PLC results in the decrease of anti-TCR staining with mAb but did not affect other, non-GPI-linked surface antigens, such as CD44 (Fig. 1B). In parallel the appearance of 125I-labeled 2C-TCR molecules was observed in supernatants of PLC-treated cells (Fig. 1C, inset). PLC treatment of 4F7 T cells was shown to effectively remove another GPI-linked surface protein (i.e. Thy-1, HSA) without affecting expression of non-GPI-linked proteins (e.g. TCR and CD45; data not shown). We also confirmed the antigen-specific binding of PLC-released soluble 2C-TCR molecules that were purified using clonotypic anti-2C-TCR mAb 1.B2 (Fig. 1C). Indeed, the purified 2C-TCR molecules were able to bind to H-2Ld molecules loaded with specific (p2Ca), but not with control (pMCMV) peptide, as detected by plasmon resonance assay (Fig. 1C). The soluble 2C-TCR was also found to bind to clonotypic 1B.2 mAb in a parallel experiment (data not shown). Taken together, these results justified the use of a procedure involving PLC pretreatment of 2C-TCR transfectants followed by immunoprecipitation with mAb to TCR for the specific purification of 2C-αβTCR molecules in order to study their ectodomain phosphorylation. After 4 h of metabolic labeling with 32Pi followed by cell lysis and immunoprecipitation with the clonotypic anti-2C-TCR mAb we observed phosphorylated TCR molecules on SDS-PAGE gel. 32P-Labeled 2C-TCR is seen as disulfide linked heterodimer that comigrates with 125I-surface-labeled TCR (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylated 2C-TCR molecules were released from the cell surface by PLC treatment after 16 h of metabolic cell labeling and were detected in the supernatants by immunoprecipitation with clonotypic 1B.2 mAb and SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions similar to 125I-surface-labeled TCR (Fig. 2, panels C and D, lanes 4). In control samples no αβTCR bands were observed when cells were not exposed to PLC (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 3 and 5) or if no 1B2.mAb was used (lanes 1 and 2). H57-597 mAb anti-mouse TCR common epitope was used with the same results (data not shown) as clonotypic mAb 1B.2. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the 32Pi-labeled proteins detected in anti-TCR mAb immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2) were, indeed, the GPI-linked αβTCR chains. The detailed time course of the cell labeling with 32Pi and PLC-treatment (Fig. 2B) demonstrated that 32P-labeled αβTCR molecules could be detected on the cell surface as early as after 1 h and established 16 h as the best and most convenient time of 32Pi labeling to observe the 32P-phosphorylated and PLC-releasable αβTCR molecules. Phosphoamino acid analysis of SDS-PAGE separated TCR protein bands both under reducing (Fig. 3, panels A and B) and non-reducing (Fig. 3, panels C and D) conditions revealed the presence of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but not phosphotyrosine. The same results were obtained by phosphoamino acid analysis of TCR isolated by immunoprecipitation from either total cell extracts of 32Pi metabolically labeled T cells (data not shown) or from the PLC-releasable fraction (Fig. 3). Detection of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine also excluded the possibility that the radioactivity observed on autoradiographs (Fig. 2) in αβ2C-TCR chains was due only to the 32P-labeled phosphoinositol, which was released with αβTCR ectodomains after treatment with PLC. It is of interest that some yet-to-be identified T-cell phosphoproteins were co-immunoprecipitated with TCR (Fig. 2) and were ectophosphorylated by [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Phosphorylation of αβTCR ectodomains in ectophosphorylation assay using normal T cells and in GPI-TCR transfectants. Intact cells were incubated with extracellular [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP for 10 min in conditions of ectophosphorylation assay, washed, and solubilized for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE in reducing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel A, immunocomplexes of αβTCR obtained with anti-TCR mAb H57-597 mAb (lanes 2 and 4) or without anti-TCR mAb (lanes 1 and 3) after [γ-32P]ATP ectophosphorylation assay with cells isolated from peripheral lymph nodes (lanes 1 and 2) or thymus (lanes 3 and 4). Panel B, thymoma cells 4F7 were treated with (lanes 1 and 3) or without (lanes 2 and 4) acid phosphatase (200 units/ml for 10 min), washed twice and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Immunoprecipitation with anti-TCR mAb H57-597 mAb are shown in lanes 3 and 4. Control immunoprecipitations are in lanes 1 and 2. Panels C and D, ectophosphorylation of 2B4 T-helper hybridoma cells and of 2C-TCR transfectants. Cells were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (lanes 1 and 2) or [γ-32P]GTP (lanes 3 and 4), solublized by detergent and 2B4 TCR was immunoprecipitated with anti-TCR mAb H57-597 mAb (Panel C, lanes 2 and 4) while 2C-TCR was immunoprecipitated with clonotypic 1B.2 anti-TCR mAb (Panel D, lanes 2 and 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) While the use of 2C-TCR transfectants provided a convenient model system, we also studied the phosphorylation of αβTCR in other cell lines. The 32Pi labeling of αβTCR in phosphorylation assays, similar to those used in demonstration of CD3 chain phosphorylation (21Samelson L.E. Harford J. Schwartz R.H. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), has not yet been reported. Fig. 4A demonstrates phosphorylated αβTCR from 2B4 T cells after 16 h of 32Pi metabolic labeling (Fig. 4A, lane 3) which comigrate with 125I-labeled αβTCR (Fig. 4B, lane 2) molecules. The strikingly evolutionary conserved (between rabbit, human, and mouse) protein kinase phosphorylation sites were revealed in both CαTCR and CβTCR ectodomains (Fig. 4C) by analyzing their published (22Harindranath N. Lamoyi E. Mage R.G. Immunogenetics. 1989; 30: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Marche P.N. Kindt T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) amino acid sequences. Interestingly, the CKII phosphorylation site in CβTCR is located in the solvent-exposed insertion absent in C domains of Ig, as indicated in the x-ray crystallographic structure of the TCR β chain (24Bentley G.A. Boulot G. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Science. 1995; 267: 1984-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of αβTCR ectodomains in normal T cells and in GPI-TCR transfectants was also studied in an ectophosphorylation assay by using extracellular [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP as a phosphate donor. We observed αβTCR phosphorylation by extracellular [γ-32P]ATP in thymocytes, lymph node cells (Fig. 5, panel A), and T cell lines (Fig. 5, panels B-D). To avoid misinterpretation (13Skubitz K.M. Goueli S.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5902-5911PubMed Google Scholar) we introduced two new and more stringent controls: (i) the requirement to confirm the extracellular [γ-32P]ATP-mediated phosphorylation of intact cells by using transfectants with transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail lacking TCR molecules; (ii) the requirement for [γ-32P]ATP-mediated ectophosphorylation to be affected by pretreatment of cells with membrane-impermeable protein phosphatases. These requirements are satisfied in experiments where we observed the phosphorylation of 2C-TCR in transfectants after incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5, panel D) similar to the phosphorylation after 32Pi metabolic labeling of the cells (Fig. 2). The pretreatment of T cells with protein phosphatases dramatically improved the [γ-32P]ATP-mediated ectophosphorylation of αβTCR as was expected if the majority of αβTCR ectodomain-phosphorylation sites has been constitutively phosphorylated (Fig. 5, panel B). Incubation of intact cells with both extracellular [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-32P]GTP resulted in phosphorylation of proteins that were immunoprecipitated with clonotypic anti-TCR mAb (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The abilities of both [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]GTP (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4) to serve as phosphate donors in ectophosphorylation reactions are hallmarks of the casein II kinases (25Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Issinger O. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4336-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In our earlier studies of ectophosphorylation assays with specific inhibitors and enhancers of CKII, 4S. A. Redegeld, P. Smith, and M. Sitkovsky, unpublished observations. we found that a casein kinase II-like enzymatic activity was the major ectokinase activity in T cells. The results of the experiments presented above strongly suggest that ectodomain phosphorylation may take place both intracellularly and extracellularly. Importantly, the intracellular phosphorylation of αβTCR is constitutive, since no additional stimuli were required to observe it in metabolically 32Pi-labeled T cells. The demonstrated effects of extracellularly added protein phosphatases (Fig. 5, panel B) support the possibility of the ectodomain phosphorylation being a reversible process. We describe here the constitutive phosphorylation of T cell surface protein ectodomains using recombinant αβTCR T cell transfectants as a model system. The possibility is raised that such phosphorylation may reflect the functioning of the previously unexplored mechanism of regulation of TCR-mediated cognate T cell's interactions. Indeed, T lymphocytes seem to possess the complete system of reversible extracellular phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as evidenced by the extracellular ATP accumulation in TCR-triggered T cells (26Filippini A. Taffs R.E. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8267-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), by the description of T cell-associated ATPases (6Filippini A. Taffs R.E.

Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) 5F. Redegeld, unpublished observations. and as demonstrated here by ectodomain phosphorylation of functionally important T cell surface protein (αβTCR). The function of the highly active ecto-ATPase activities on T cells (6Filippini A. Taffs R.E. Agui T. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 334-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be to provide an additional level of regulation of the extracellular domains phosphorylation and signaling through purinergic receptors by limiting the concentration of the extracellular ATP near the cell surface. Extracellular domains of αβTCR have been the subject of intensive investigations, since they contain the antigen recognition and binding sites (1Hedric S.M. Eidelman F.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1993: 383Google Scholar) and regulate antigenic peptide recognition due to their interactions with CD4 ectodomains (4Vignali D.A. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1945-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and/or other surface proteins which form the multimolecular TCR·CD3 complex. The involvement of αβTCR ectodomain-mediated interactions is also implied by considerations of the role of αβTCR dimerization and aggregation (27Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Sternj L.J.

In addition, αβTCR-CD3 ectodomain interactions were shown to be important for the assembly of TCR·CD3 molecular complexes (3Wileman T. Kane L.P. Young J. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The possibility of the role of extracellular ATP in extracellular domain phosphorylation of functionally important proteins in T cell's effector functions was first raised during earlier studies of the biochemical mechanisms of CTL-target cell interactions (7Redegeld F.

Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 26Filippini A. Taffs R.E. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8267-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and it was important to explore whether reversible αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation could be the fine-tuning mechanism of TCR-mediated immune responses. The ectophosphorylation in different cellular systems has been studied over the last several decades (reviewed in 20Naik U.P. Kornecki E. Ehrlich Y.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 31Kubler D.W. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 322-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and elaborate criteria were developed to avoid many potential problems in interpretations of ectophosphorylation assays. Nevertheless, none of these criteria were sufficient, and intracellularly-cytoplasmic tail-phosphorylated proteins could be still misinterpreted as “ectophosphorylated” (13Skubitz K.M. Goueli S.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5902-5911PubMed Google Scholar). 6P. Smith, S. Apasov, and M. Sitkovsky, unpublished results. Thus, the definitive demonstration of phosphorylation of ectodomains had yet to be provided in any cellular system, and a new approach was needed to demonstrate the presence of phosphorylated amino acid residues in αβTCR ectodomains. The demonstration of αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation was accomplished here using T cells stably transfected with transmembrane domain- and cytoplasmic tail-lacking GPI anchor-linked molecules of 2C-αβTCR and labeled both in a [γ-32P]ATP ectophosphorylation assay and in a long-term 32Pi metabolic labeling assay (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This allowed us to independently confirm experiments with 32Pi-labeled 2C-TCR transfectants or normal T cells with results of ectophosphorylation assay obtained by incubating intact cells with [γ-32P]ATP/GTP. The important differences between αβTCR ectodomains and intracellular domains of the TCR·CD3 complex phosphorylation were revealed here by phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 3). In contrast to well documented intracellular domain tyrosine phosphorylation (2Weiss A. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1993: 467Google Scholar), only the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but no phosphotyrosine, were detected in our studies of αβTCR ectodomains. The interchangeable use of ATP and GTP (Fig. 5) as phosphate donors in αβTCR ectophosphorylation has important implications, since it not only implicates ectokinase with CKII-like properties in αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation but it also eliminates the possibility of the opening of ATP4−-gated nonspecific membrane pores-P2z receptors (8Apasov S. Koshiba M. Redegeld F. Sitkovsky M. Immunol. Rev. 1995; 146: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with experiments demonstrating the effects of CKII inhibitors and enhancers on the ectophosphorylation of surface proteins on T cells (data not shown). Taken together, the results described above and studies of the effects of pretreatment of cells with protein phosphatases and protein kinases (Fig. 5 and data not shown) are consistent with the model in which ectodomains of TCR are constitutively intracellularly serine/threonine phosphorylated and then expressed on the cell surface. The detection of both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine indicates the possibility that there are several phosphorylation sites in each of the αβ TCR chains. Subsequently, αβTCR ectodomains can be dephosphorylated extracellularly by PP1 and PP2A ectoprotein phosphatase(s) (data not shown) and further rephosphorylated by CKII-like or other ectoenzyme with extracellular ATP/GTP as a phosphate donor. The implication of ecto-CKII-PKase in αβTCR ectophosphorylation is especially intriguing in view of strikingly evolutionary conserved (between rabbit, mouse and human) consensus phosphorylation sites for CKII in the Cβ domain of αβTCR and of tandem PKC and CKII phosphorylation sites in the Cα domain (Fig. 4C). The functional role of αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation remains to be definitively established and the most promising approach appears to be in testing the effects of mutation of the ectophosphorylation site on cognate interactions of T cells transfected with mutated αβTCR and studies of the effects of phosphorylation of soluble recombinant TCR on TCR/MHC class I-peptide interactions using plasmon resonance techniques. The extracellular phosphorylation system described here may have important immunopharmacologic implications, since the well defined phosphorylation sites in ectodomains of functionally important surface proteins and ectoenzymes (protein kinases and protein phosphatases) would provide attractive targets for immunomodulation due to their surface location. In conclusion, we would like to speculate that αβTCR chains have more than one phosphorylated residue in each chain and, depending on their location, they may influence associations of αβTCR chains with CD3 molecules and/or associations of αβTCR chains with CD4/CD8 co-receptors or other molecules comprising the TCR·CD3 complex. It should be also tested whether the αβTCR ectodomain phosphorylation may affect recognition and binding properties of αβTCR variable regions thereby providing an attractive mechanism of “On/Off” switch in regulation of formation and separation of cells in CTL/target cell or Th cell/antigen presenting cells conjugates.

L-lactate dehydrogenase fructose 1,6-bisphosphate B. longum L-lactate dehydrogenase nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Bifidobacterium longum LDH (BLLDH) is an FBP-dependent allosteric LDH (3Minowa T. Iwata S. Sakai H. Masaki H. Ohta T. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Iwata S. Minowa T. Sakai H. Ohta T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1989; 53: 3365-3366Google Scholar), and its crystal structures have been reported (5Iwata S. Ohta T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Four subunits of BLLDH are related by three molecular 2-fold axes named P, Q, and R (Fig. 1) as in the definition of vertebrate LDHs (7Rossmann M.G. Adams M.J. Buehner M. Ford G.C. Hackert M.L. Liljas A. Rao S.T. Banaszak L.J. Hill E. Tsernoglou D. Webb L. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). BLLDH has subunit contacts only in the subunit interfaces along the P- and Q-axes, but not in that of the R-axis. The tetramer has four active sites but only two FBP-binding sites. The FBP-binding site is at the P-axis interface and one site is composed of residues from two subunits related by the P-axis, where the anion binding site of vertebrate LDHs is (8Adams M.J. Liljas A. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Arg-173 2Residue numbers are given in the N-system (32Eventoff W. Rossmann M.G. Taylor S.S. Torff H.-J. Meyer H. Keil W. Kiltz H.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). and His-188 of this site form salt bridges with phosphate moieties of the bound FBP molecule. The active site is at the Q-axis subunit interface, in which His-195 is essential for enzyme catalysis and substrate binding (2Holbrook J.J. Liljas A. Steindel S.J. Rossmann M.G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 191Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of BLLDH reported more recently (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), two kinds of tetramers, one in a no-affinity state (T-state) and one in a high-affinity state (R-state) to the substrate, were found in the same crystal lattice, and a model of allosteric transition based on the concerted model by Monod et al. (9Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) was proposed. This “Monod-Wyman-Changeux crystal” has not only provided evidence for the existence of two different allosteric states within this protein, but also allowed detailed comparison of the states. The activation process of the enzyme, however, including communication between the active site and the effector site, remains unclear since crystallography gives only static images of the two extreme states. To characterize the activation of the enzyme, we applied the subunit hybridization technique to BLLDH. Previously, we reported an in vivo hybridization technique that used two-plasmid transformants of Escherichia coli (10Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar). We did produce subunit hybrids in this way, but transformants were unstable because two plasmids with different antibiotic resistance were harbored in the cells. Moreover, the mutational tag designed for separation of the hybrids was unsuitable and affected the allostericity of the enzyme. Therefore, interpretation of the results was difficult. Here, we developed a new in vivo subunit hybridization system with a plasmid that carries two BLLDH genes tandemly. This system is more stable than the previous one. The mutational tag was redesigned so as not to affect the allosteric properties of the enzyme. Here we describe the production and separation of subunit hybrids with this system. One group of hybrids were between FBP-desensitized and wild-type subunits. The other group were between FBP-desensitized and inactive subunits. From the kinetics of the hybrids obtained, we found how activation at the FBP binding site is transmitted to the active sites. These results are consistent with the crystal structure-based allosteric model of the enzyme (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Sodium pyruvate and NADH were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Life Technologies Oriental (Tokyo, Japan), respectively. The enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, Takara Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan), and Toyobo Biochemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Oligonucleotides were synthesized with a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 391). Site-directed mutagenesis was done with a Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) as described by Kunkel (11Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), and the DNA fragments were sequenced to check for mutations. Oligonucleotides 5′-CTC GCC GCT CTC GAG GAC TCT GCC GAG ACG-3′ and 5′-C ATC GCC GGT GAG AAC GGC GAC TCC GAA GTC-3′ were synthesized to obtain mutant enzymes K316E/R317D 3Lys-316 and Arg-317 were replaced with glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively similar abbreviations are used throughout. and H195N, respectively. From the expression vector for the K316E/R317D mutant derived from pUBM9 (12Iwata S. Minowa T. Mikami B. Morita Y. Ohta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 558-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), a 350-base pair SalI-SalI fragment that contained the region for His-195 was replaced with a SalI-SalI fragment of Asn-195 to construct a H195N/K316E/R317D mutant. The FBP-desensitized mutant with R173Q/H188Y was described previously (10Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar). Expression vectors for in vivo hybridization were constructed to carry two BLLDH genes tandemly. Both contained the tac promoter and a transcriptional terminator. Expression vectors for mutant enzymes were prepared from pUBM9 (12Iwata S. Minowa T. Mikami B. Morita Y. Ohta T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 558-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. In these plasmids, a BamHI unique site is found before the promoter and a PvuII unique site is found after the terminator. A 1.6-kilobase BamHI-PvuII fragment was used as a cassette of the complete BLLDH gene. Expression vectors were constructed for hybrid formation between desensitized and wild-type subunits and for hybrid formation between desensitized and inactive subunits. For the first, the BamHI-PvuII fragment of the desensitized LDH gene was blunted and inserted into the PvuII site of the expression vector of wild-type LDH. For the second, the DNA fragment of an inactive LDH gene was similarly inserted into the PvuII site of the expression vector of desensitized LDH. All mutant enzymes used had Cys-210B replaced by serine. This mutant, which is resistant to oxidation although its allosteric properties are the same as those of the wild type, was used before in our previous crystallographic work (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The two groups of hybrids studied here were produced and separated in the conditions described below. E. coli MV1184 (13Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar) cells harboring an expression vector were grown at 37°C in 2 × YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1.0% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the cell growth reached an optical density of about 0.8 at 660 nm, isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mM) was added to the culture medium. After cultivation for 3 h more, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), which was used throughout as described below. After disruption of the cells by sonication, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Then the supernatant was treated at 65°C for 20 min to denature E. coli proteins. After centrifugation, solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the supernatant with stirring to 30% saturation. From the supernatant obtained, an active fraction was separated on a column of Butyl-Toyopearl 650 M (Tosoh Corp.) with a decreasing linear gradient of 30 to 0% saturation of ammonium sulfate. After dialysis, the enzyme was further purified on a column of Blue Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) with an elution buffer containing 0.1 mM NADH and 0.5 M KCl. The final step of purification was on a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column with an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Pharmacia) and a linear gradient of 0 to 0.6 M KCl in 40 min. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. In this step, hybrids were separated by their charged tags as described under “Results.” In buffers of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 0-0.6 M KCl, the separated hybrids were stable and subunit exchange did not occur. Nondenaturating (native) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done as described by Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), but without SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Densitometric analysis was done with the program NIH-image. The standard assay condition of enzyme activity was at 30°C in 50 mM MES-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2 mM NADH, 5 mM pyruvate, and 0.1 mM FBP. The steady-state kinetics of the hybrids was examined at various concentrations of pyruvate and FBP. The concentration of enzyme subunits was 4.3 nM. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that converted 1 μmol of substrate/min. LDH is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of the substrate (see Fig. 3c), so only data obtained with low substrate concentrations were used for calculation of kinetic parameters. The Y function of the concerted model (9Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) was not used, because calculated parameters are unreliable if there is substrate inhibition. Instead, the Hill equation (15Dixon M. Webb E.C. Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Longman, London1979: 400-402Google Scholar) was used to calculate the maximum velocity of catalysis Vmax, the half-saturating concentration of pyruvate (S0.5), and the Hill coefficient nH: vVmax=( pyruvate )nH( pyruvate )nH+S0.5nH(Eq. 1) Hybrid D1I3, with only one active site, was analyzed with the Michaelis equation. A0.5(FBP) is the half-activating concentration of FBP at 5 mM pyruvate. The wild-type enzyme might have a sigmoidal saturation curve for FBP because it has two FBP-binding sites. However, FBP can bind the enzyme in both its T- and R-states at high affinity, so it gave a hyperbolic curve. Curve fitting was done with the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). Together with the wild-type BLLDH (abbreviated W), we used two kinds of mutants in which the FBP-binding or active site was impaired. Mutant enzyme D, which is desensitized to FBP, was obtained by replacement of Arg-173 and His-188 with glutamine and tyrosine, respectively (Fig. 1). Mutant enzyme I, which had no catalytic activity, was obtained by replacement of His-195 with asparagine. The specific activity of enzyme I was 0.04 units/mg of purified protein, negligible compared with that of the wild-type enzyme (≈1000 units/mg). Results of measurement of NADH fluorescence (16Clarke A.R. Wigley D.B. Chia W.N. Barstow D. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that this inactive enzyme could bind the coenzyme NADH. CD spectra of all mutants were almost the same (data not shown). We studied two groups of subunit hybrid enzymes. First, we constructed D-W hybrids, between D and W subunits, to characterize the “odd” FBP-binding site composed of residues from the W and D subunits (Fig. 2c). Next, D-I hybrids, between D and I subunits, were constructed for use in an examination of allosteric communication between the FBP-binding and active sites. In other words, this study was undertaken to find whether the activation occurs within the subunit (intra-subunit activation) or indirectly through a quaternary structural change in the tetramer (inter-subunit activation). The I subunit could form FBP-binding sites but was catalytically inactive, so we could observe the enzyme activity of the D subunit only. In vivo hybrid formation between two kinds of subunits of BLLDH occurred in E. coli cells and a mixture of hybrids was produced, as described previously (10Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar). To separate these hybrids easily, we modified the surface charge of one of the pair of subunits. For a negatively charged tag, Lys-316 and Arg-317 were replaced with glutamic acid and aspartic acid, respectively. These residues are in the last helix, sticking out into the solvent and far from both the active site and the FBP-binding site (Fig. 1). Allosteric properties of the charge-tagged enzyme were not affected by these mutations (see Fig. 3c), but the expression level in E. coli cells was reduced to about 50% that of the untagged enzyme, for an unknown reason. The negatively charged tag could produce a difference in the total surface charge of different hybrid tetramers. This difference made separation of these hybrids possible by anion-exchange chromatography (Fig. 2a) or native PAGE (Fig. 2b). In D-W hybrids, the wild-type (W) subunit was tagged (Fig. 2c). In D-I hybrids, the inactive (I) subunit was tagged. In consequence, D, W, and I subunits had the mutations R173Q/H188Y, K316E/R317D, and H195N/K316E/R317D, respectively. We regarded the tagged K316E/R317D mutant as the wild-type enzyme in this study. Expression vectors for the hybrid enzymes carrying two LDH genes tandemly were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The D-W hybrids expressed in E. coli cells gave five bands on native PAGE (Fig. 2b, lanes 0). The band intensities were well simulated by binomial distribution of tetrameric hybrids between D and W subunits with the molar ratio of 2:1 (untagged subunit: charge-tagged subunit). This finding means that random hybridization between D and W subunits had occurred. The five bands at regular intervals arose from five differently charged hybrids. By anion-exchange chromatography, the same D-W hybrids separated, to our surprise, into six peaks (Fig. 2a). Each peak seemed to be of a hybrid with a different composition and structural arrangement of subunits from the others. The results of this chromatography and of native PAGE (Fig. 2b), and the kinetic data described below were referred to when we named the hybrids in peaks 1 to 6 D4, D3W1, D2W2-QR, D2W2-P, D1W3, and W4 (Fig. 2c), respectively. D2W2-QR in peak 3 and D2W2-P in peak 4 had the same mobility on native PAGE. The ratio of the areas of the peaks corresponding to these hybrids in anion-exchange chromatography was about 2:1 (1.7:1 in Fig. 2a). Re-chromatography of these two hybrids from separate peaks gave only peaks at the same positions as before. D2W2-P contained two D subunits along the molecular P-axis, with one intact FBP-binding site. On the other hand, D2W2-QR was a mixture of the two other hybrids with two D subunits along the Q- and R-axes, without an intact FBP-binding site (Fig. 2c). For D-I hybrids also, native PAGE gave five bands and anion-exchange chromatography gave six peaks (data not shown), like the D-W hybrids. The level of expression of the charge-tagged I subunit was again about 50% that of the D subunit. The hybrids in peaks 1 to 6 were named D4, D3I1, D2I2-QR, D2I2-P, D1I3, and I4, like D-W hybrids. Pyruvate saturation curves of the D-W hybrids with and without FBP were classified into three types (Fig. 3, a-c). D4, D3W1, and D2W2-QR were desensitized to FBP (Fig. 3a), so they had no intact FBP-binding sites. Their pyruvate saturation curves were sigmoidal, still showing homotropic activation by the substrate. The Hill coefficients of D4, D3W1, and D2W2-QR in the absence of FBP were 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, respectively. D2W2-P, D1W3, and W4 were activated by FBP. The concentrations of FBP for half-maximal activation, A0.5(FBP), of D2W2-P, D1W3, and W4 at 5 mM pyruvate were 13, 7, and 6 nM, respectively; they had practically the same sensitivity to FBP. The greatest difference among them was sigmoidality of the pyruvate saturation curves in the presence of FBP. In the presence of 0.1 mM FBP, the curve for W4 was almost hyperbolic (Fig. 3c) but the curves for D2W2-P and D1W3 were sigmoidal (Fig. 3b). The Hill coefficients of D2W2-P, D1W3, and W4 in the presence of FBP were 1.9, 2.7, and 1.3, respectively. The concentrations of pyruvate for half-maximal activity, S0.5, of D2W2-P, D1W3, and W4 were decreased by the addition of FBP and could be calculated with smaller error than without FBP (Fig. 4a). The S0.5 of W4 was smaller than the values for D2W2-P and D1W3. The difference seems to arise from D2W2-P and D1W3 having only one intact FBP-binding site but W4 having two. These results agree with predictions from the crystal structure-based concerted allosteric model (discussed below). These results were different from our previous ones (10Ohta T. Yokota K. Minowa T. Iwata S. Faraday Discuss. 1992; 93: 153-161Crossref Google Scholar). In the previous study, the D2W2 hybrid did not separate into two peaks. The hybrids that contained one or more D subunits were desensitized and had pyruvate saturation curves similar to the curve of D4. The separation tag (two charged residues) added at the C-terminal seems to have caused a structural change in the D subunit, constraining quaternary subunit rotation. In this study, the tag position was chosen so as not to affect the allosteric properties of the enzyme, and accompanying steric effects enabled D2W2 “isomers” to be separated. Pyruvate saturation curves for D-I hybrids are shown in Fig. 5. D4, D3I1, and D2I2-QR were desensitized to FBP (Fig. 5a), so these hybrids had no intact FBP-binding sites. Their saturation curves for pyruvate were sigmoidal. On the other hand, D2I2-P (Fig. 5b) and D1I3 (Fig. 5c) were activated by FBP. These results suggest that the enzyme activation by FBP was transmitted from the I subunits to the D subunit(s) via the Q-axis interface, because a functional FBP-binding site was formed in the P-axis interface between the two I subunits, and because the D subunit(s) touches I subunit(s) in the Q-axis interface. I4 was always inactive (data not shown). As I subunits had no activity, Vmax was nearly proportional to the number of intact active sites in the hybrids (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). In Fig. 6, the two upward-deviating points of Vmax for hybrid enzymes with one and two active subunits are those of D1I3 and D2I2-P, respectively, in the presence of FBP. Hybrids with fewer intact active sites had saturation curves for pyruvate that were less sigmoidal and when curves were less sigmoidal, the Hill coefficient was lower (Fig. 6). D1I3 had hyperbolic saturation curves both with and without FBP (Fig. 5c), and they fit the Michaelis equation well.Fig. 6Correlation between the number of active sites and two kinetic parameters, Vmax and Hill coefficients, of D-I hybrids. Vmax values of the FBP-desensitized hybrids D4, D3I1, and D2I2-QR (squares) and of the FBP-sensitive hybrids D2I2-P and D1I3 (circles) are indicated by the appropriate symbol. Hill coefficients of the FBP-desensitized hybrids (triangles pointing down) and of the FBP-sensitive hybrids (triangles pointing up) are also shown. Both values without FBP (open symbols) and with 0.1 mM FBP (closed symbols) are given. The values were calculated on the basis of the saturation curves shown in Fig. 5 by the Hill equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The S0.5 of D2I2-P and D1I3 decreased when FBP was added (Fig. 4b). A0.5(FBP) values of D2I2-P and D1I3 at 5 mM pyruvate were both 80 nM. The intrinsic affinities of their FBP-binding sites should be unchanged, but their A0.5(FBP) were larger than that of the wild-type enzyme W4, 6 nM. For D2I2-P and D1I3, the activities with and without FBP were not so different at 5 mM pyruvate (see Fig. 5, b and c) as for W4 (Fig. 3c). These differences in the degree of FBP activation seemed to result in the A0.5(FBP) values of the hybrids being higher than the value of the wild-type enzyme. From the mobility of the hybrid proteins on native PAGE, the numerical subunit compositions of the substance in each peak on Mono-Q chromatography could be assigned. Structural assignment for D2W2-P and D2W2-QR was based on the following reasoning, which also applied to the D-I hybrids D2I2-P and D2I2-QR. A hybrid composed of two D subunits and two W subunits (D2W2) should be a mixture of three isomers that have two D subunits related by the P-, Q-, or R-axis (see Fig. 2c). These three isomers have the same overall charge, so they had exactly the same mobility on native PAGE. Probably for some steric reason, however, these isomers separated into two peaks on anion-exchange chromatography. From the stoichiometry of their peak areas in chromatography, it was seen that two of the three isomers were in peak 3 of Fig. 2a and that the other isomer was in peak 4. The isomers in peak 3 were completely desensitized to FBP but the isomer in peak 4 was sensitive to FBP. What was important was that only one of the three isomers had intact FBP-binding site. Therefore, it was reasonable to assign these hybrids to peaks 3 and 4 as in Fig. 2c. The kinetic properties of other hybrids, with their own unique structural arrangements, also can be interpreted solely by the assumption that the FBP-binding site has a “dominant negative” nature. That D3W1 was completely desensitized indicated that the odd FBP-binding site composed of W and D subunits did not work. On the other hand, the strong activation of D1W3 by FBP indicated that the enzyme can be activated if there is one intact FBP-binding site. The side chains of Arg-173 and His-188 surround FBP from both subunits and interact with the phosphate moieties in the crystal structures (5Iwata S. Ohta T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, the replacement of R173Q/H188Y on one side must destroy the integrity of the binding site. The difference in the affinity between D2W2-QR and D2W2-P for the column may be accounted for the different location of charged tags on the enzyme, since no difference was observed on native PAGE or in the CD spectra. The distance between tags for D2W2-P, D2W2-Q, and D2W2-R hybrids were 45, 70, and 80 Å, respectively (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2c). Negative charges were closer together in the D2W2-P hybrid than in the other two hybrids. This difference could explain the stronger affinity of D2W2-P for the anion exchanger. On column chromatography, only a part of the enzyme surface could touch the matrix. We earlier proposed a model (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for the activation mechanism of BLLDH based on the crystal structures of the T- and R-states coexisting in the same crystal lattice. In that model, (i) FBP neutralizes the positive charge repulsion at the P-axis interface. (ii) The conformational change at the interface triggers a quaternary structural change to the R-state. (iii) The active site at the Q-axis subunit interface is affected by this quaternary structural change and takes on an active conformation. The quaternary structural change was thought to fulfill the concerted model of Monod et al. (9Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar), in which the tetramer can contain either four T-state subunits (no affinity to substrate) or four R-state subunits (high affinity). Hybridization experiments support the validity of this model. D-W hybrids could be classified into three types on the basis of their homotropic and heterotropic activation patterns. Each type corresponded to the number of intact FBP-binding sites. The second type had a sigmoidal saturation curve for pyruvate even in the presence of FBP. This property can be accounted by the presence of both functional and nonfunctional FBP-binding sites in these two hybrids. The sigmoidal saturation curve indicated that the T-state was still dominant to the R-state in the presence of FBP. Charge repulsion at the P-axis interface seems to be partially neutralized by one FBP and the shift of equilibrium probably remains in an intermediate state. The D-I hybrid experiments about enzyme activation by FBP showed inter-subunit allosteric communication via the Q-axis interface at a distance of about 40 Å. This result indicates that allosteric activation is mediated by a quaternary structural change. The quaternary structural change at the Q-axis interface has actually been observed by crystal structure analysis of BLLDH (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This structural change is accompanied by helix sliding at the Q-axis interface and subsequent positional replacement of His-68 of the next subunit along the Q-axis by Arg-171, one of the active-site residues, giving R-state. In the case of LDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus, an allosteric mechanism caused by intra-subunit structural change is proposed (17Cameron A.D. Roper D.I. Moreton K.M. Muirhead H. Holbrook J.J. Wigley D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In that model, the binding of FBP causes Arg-173 to move and helix α2F to shift so that positioning of two adjacent residues, Arg-171 and Asp-168, that form the active site is improved. However, BLLDH clearly does not act in this way because such an intra-subunit tertiary structural change could not explain the allosteric communication between the Q-axis-related subunits. Enzyme activation with FBP caused S0.5 of both D-W and D-I hybrids to decrease, indicating that the hybrids retain the Km type allosteric properties (9Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) of the wild-type enzyme. The concerted allosteric model is interpreted on the basis of the Km type system (9Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar), but not on that of the Vmax type system. The increases in Vmax accompanying activation of D-I hybrids with FBP, however, were about 2-fold (Fig. 5, b and c). There seems to be some additional mechanism by which the Vmax of the enzyme is increased in the presence of FBP. In this process, the inter-subunit transmission of activation is probably also involved, since Vmax of the D subunits changed when FBP bound to the I subunits. In the D-I hybrid experiments, as the number of D subunits decreased, the Hill coefficient decreased, approaching 1 (Fig. 6) and S0.5 also decreased (Fig. 4b). The decrease in the Hill coefficient agrees well with the allosteric model, but the behavior of S0.5 is contradictory. If the D-I hybrids keep the strict concerted model and have the same allosteric equilibrium constant, L (L = (enzyme in T-state)/(enzyme in R-state) in the absence of substrate), as the wild type, S0.5 should increase as the number of active D subunits decrease (18Gibbons I. Ritchey J.M. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1324-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We suppose that the discrepancy arises because of the incorporation of I subunits into the hybrids, shifting the equilibrium toward the R-state. Replacement of His-195, which is near the Q-axis subunit interface, with asparagine may affect the equilibrium. Hydrophobicity at the Q-axis interface seems to contribute to the energy balance between the two states as does charge repulsion at the P-axis interface (6Iwata S. Kamata K. Yoshida S. Minowa T. Ohta T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In vitro subunit hybridization is a classical method used to study subunit interactions in many oligomeric enzymes including non-allosteric vertebrate LDHs (2Holbrook J.J. Liljas A. Steindel S.J. Rossmann M.G. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol 11. Academic Press, New York1975: 191Google Scholar, 19Goldberg E. Arch. Biochem.

Because allosteric cooperativity often depends on subunit interactions (24Perutz M.F. Mechanisms of Cooperativity and Allosteric Regulation in Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England1989Crossref Scopus (485) Google Scholar), the method should be useful for the study of allosteric proteins, and has been so used to examine aspartate transcarbamylase (18Gibbons I.

Sci. 1993; 18: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Inter-subunit allosteric communications also have been observed with hybrid enzymes (28Wang C. Yang Y.R. Hu C.Y.

Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conditions for in vitro hybridization can be difficult to establish, but in vivo hybridization always produces hybrid enzymes because the subunits are hybridized just after translation as a normal assembly of oligomers. Because of advances in gene cloning and expression, in vivo subunit hybridization can now be more generally used than in vitro hybridization. Analyses of hybrid enzymes and structural studies done together can provide information needed in the other kind of analysis, as in the BLLDH studies described here. Knowledge about structure is information about the static protein and dynamics can be added by studies of hybrid enzymes. The combination of these methods might establish the molecular mechanism of many allosteric proteins."

Elongin A is the transcriptionally active component of the Elongin (SIII) complex. Whereas Elongin A is capable of weakly stimulating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of Elongin B and C, neither Elongin B nor Elongin C affects the activity of polymerase in the absence of Elongin A (16Garrett K.P.

Elongin C is capable of interacting directly with Elongin A in the absence of Elongin B to form an AC complex with increased specific activity, suggesting that Elongin C functions as a direct activator of Elongin A. Elongin B, a member of the ubiquitin homology gene family, does not appear to interact directly with Elongin A. Evidence suggests that Elongin B plays a chaperone-like role in assembly of the Elongin (SIII) complex by binding to Elongin C and facilitating its interaction with Elongin A. As part of our effort to understand the structure, mechanism of action, and regulation of the Elongin (SIII) complex, we are carrying out a systematic structure-function analysis of the each of the Elongin subunits. Here we describe studies leading to the identification of Elongin C regions important for binding to Elongin B and for binding and activation of Elongin A.

Plasmid DNA was banded twice in CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradients, precipitated with ethanol, and dissolved in TE buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA). A restriction fragment prepared by digestion of pDN-AdML DNA with EcoRI and NdeI was used as template in transcription reactions.

Following induction with 0.5 mM IPTG, the culture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 30 min. After two cycles of freeze-thaw, the suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 35 min.

After incubation for 90 min on ice, the mixtures were dialyzed at 4°C overnight against 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 40 mM KCl. Following dialysis, the mixtures were centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.

Mammalian Elongin C is a 112-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 12,473 Da (16Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In previous studies, we have shown that transcriptionally active Elongin (SIII) and Elongin subassemblies can be reconstituted by renaturation of combinations of denatured native Elongin subunits purified from rat liver (10Bradsher J.N.

To investigate the requirements for interaction of Elongin C with Elongin B, a systematic series of N-terminal, C-terminal, and internal Elongin C deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 1), expressed in E. coli, purified from inclusion bodies, and assayed for their abilities to form chromatographically isolable Elongin BC complexes. In these experiments, individual Elongin C mutants were refolded together with wild type Elongin B and subjected to TSK DEAE-NPR HPLC. Consistent with our previous results (14Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), the wild type Elongin BC complex elutes from TSK DEAE-NPR as a discrete species with chromatographic properties distinct from those of both wild type Elongin B, which flows through TSK DEAE-NPR at low ionic strength, and wild type Elongin C, which binds tighter to this resin than the Elongin BC complex (Fig. 2A) and elutes over a broad range of ionic strength. Thus, coelution of Elongin B and C from TSK DEAE-NPR is diagnostic of an interaction between the two proteins.Fig. 2Assay of formation of Elongin BC complexes containing wild type and mutant Elongin C. A, wild type Elongin B (upper panel (B)), wild type Elongin C (middle panel (C)), or a mixture of wild type Elongin B and C were refolded and subjected to DEAE-NPR HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of the indicated column fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized by silver staining.

L, load; FT, flow-through.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of as many as 28 amino acids from the C terminus of Elongin C does not prevent formation of isolable Elongin BC complexes. Likewise, deletion of as many as 18 amino acids from the N terminus of Elongin C does not prevent formation of isolable Elongin BC complexes. Deletion of 22 amino acids from the N terminus of Elongin C, however, abolished formation of isolable Elongin BC complexes, suggesting that Elongin C residues between 18 and 22 are critical for interaction of Elongin B and C. Consistent with this possibility, an Elongin C internal deletion mutant lacking residues 21-30 did not form an isolable Elongin BC complex (Fig. 2B); this mutant was the only Elongin C internal deletion mutant that failed to bind to Elongin B, suggesting that the Elongin C region between residues 18 and 30 either contains the Elongin B binding site or is crucial for proper folding of the protein. Notably, although the Elongin C internal deletion mutant lacking residues 61-70 was capable of retaining wild type Elongin B on the TSK DEAE-NPR column, the resulting Elongin BC complex eluted from the column over a broad range of ionic strength. At the present time, we do not know why this mutant Elongin BC complex elutes aberrantly from TSK DEAE-NPR. One possible explanation is that deletion of residues 61-70 alters the conformation of Elongin C without preventing it from binding Elongin B. To characterize further the Elongin C sequences most critical for binding to Elongin B, we analyzed a set of clustered alanine scanning mutants in which Elongin C residues between 19 and 30 were mutated three at a time to alanines. As shown in Fig. 2C, although Elongin C alanine scanning mutants C-(Ala19-21) and C-(Ala22-24) were capable of assembling into isolable Elongin BC complexes, C-(Ala25-27) and C-(Ala28-30) were not. In a previous study, we observed that preassembled Elongin BC complexes are capable of activating Elongin A (14Duan D.R. Pause A. Burgess W.H. Aso T. Chen D.Y.T. Garrett K.P. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D. Science. 1995; 269: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To investigate the requirements for activation of Elongin A by Elongin C, the isolated wild type and mutant Elongin BC complexes shown in Fig. 2, A and B, were assayed for their abilities to stimulate the rate of accumulation of runoff transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II from the AdML promoter in a reconstituted transcription system containing purified Elongin A and the general initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. As shown in Fig. 3, the entire C-terminal half of Elongin C is critical for activation of Elongin A by preassembled Elongin BC complexes. Whereas Elongin BC complexes containing Elongin C deletion mutants lacking up to 18 amino acids from their N termini or sequences between amino acids 41 and 60 were capable of activating Elongin A, Elongin BC complexes containing Elongin C deletion mutants lacking as few as 14 amino acids from their C termini were inactive. Furthermore, Elongin BC complexes containing all Elongin C internal deletion mutants lacking sequences C-terminal to amino acid 61 were inactive, and an Elongin BC complex containing the internal deletion mutant C-(Δ31-40), which lacks sequences immediately C-terminal to the region important for Elongin B binding, was also inactive. Finally, Elongin BC complexes containing the alanine scanning mutant C-(Ala19-21) were inactive, although BC complexes containing C-(Ala22-24) was active (Fig. 3C). Although Elongin B facilitates assembly and enhances stability of the Elongin (SIII) complex, it is not essential for activation of Elongin A by wild type Elongin C (18Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As described above, most of the Elongin C mutants containing mutations in the region between amino acids 19 and 30 were unable to form isolable Elongin BC complexes. To investigate the ability of these Elongin C mutants to activate Elongin A, they were assayed for their abilities to stimulate the rate of accumulation of runoff transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II from the AdML promoter in the presence of Elongin A and the general initiation factors, but in the absence of Elongin B. As shown in Fig. 4, although wild type Elongin C strongly activated Elongin A, none of the Elongin C mutants that failed to assemble into Elongin BC complexes was capable of activating Elongin A. To investigate whether Elongin C deletion mutants that fail to activate Elongin A are defective in their abilities to assemble into Elongin ABC complexes, Elongin C deletion mutants were assayed for their abilities to form chromatographically isolable Elongin ABC complexes. In these experiments, individual Elongin C deletion mutants were refolded together with wild type Elongin A and B and subjected to TSK SP-NPR HPLC. As described previously, Elongin A and Elongin AC and ABC complexes bind tightly to TSK SP-NPR and can all be eluted with ∼0.3 M KCl, whereas Elongin B and C flow through this resin at low ionic strength (17Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I. Lane W.S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7172-7176Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 18Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the N-terminal Elongin C deletion mutants C-(15-112) and C-(19-112), which form isolable Elongin BC complexes that activate Elongin A, were capable of assembling into isolable Elongin ABC complexes, whereas the remaining N-terminal and C-terminal Elongin C deletion mutants, which either fail to form Elongin BC complexes or form inactive BC complexes, were unable to form isolable Elongin ABC complexes. In contrast, with the exception of Elongin C internal deletion mutant C-(Δ21-30), which lacks residues 21-30 and does not form an isolable Elongin BC complex, each of the Elongin C internal deletion mutants was capable of forming an isolable Elongin ABC complex (Fig. 6A). In these experiments, the yield of Elongin B and C in purified Elongin ABC complexes containing Elongin C internal deletion mutants was routinely less than their yield in purified Elongin ABC complexes containing wild type Elongin C, suggesting that Elongin ABC complexes containing the internal deletion mutants assemble less efficiently or are less stable than wild type Elongin ABC.Fig. 6Assay of formation and activity of Elongin ABC complexes containing Elongin C internal deletion mutants. A, formation of Elongin ABC complexes was assayed as described in the legend to Fig. 5. B, runoff transcription assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” according to the protocol diagrammed at the bottom of Fig. 3A. Isolated Elongin ABC complexes were added to reactions at −10′. A, Elongin A; B, Elongin B; C, Elongin C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Runoff transcription assays were used to compare the activities of the isolated wild type and mutant Elongin ABC complexes shown in Fig. 6A. The concentration of the wild type Elongin ABC complex in the reaction shown in lane 2 of Fig. 6B was sufficient to saturate the assay, and the concentrations of mutant Elongin ABC complexes were adjusted so that all reactions shown in Fig. 6B contained equivalent levels of Elongin A. Highlighting the importance of sequences at the C terminus of Elongin C for activation of Elongin A, Elongin ABC complexes containing C-(Δ91-100) did not stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II. Likewise, Elongin ABC complexes containing C-(Δ61-70), which forms Elongin BC complexes with aberrant chromatographic properties, were inactive. Interestingly, although Elongin BC complexes containing Elongin C internal deletion mutants C-(Δ71-80) and C-(Δ81-90) were unable to activate Elongin A, Elongin ABC complexes containing these same Elongin C mutants were capable of stimulating the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II, suggesting that the Elongin C region between amino acids 71 and 90 is not critical for activation of Elongin A in pre-assembled Elongin ABC complexes. In these experiments, it is notewothy that the activity of mutant Elongin ABC complexes does not, in all cases, correlate with the amount of Elongin B and C present, since Elongin ABC complexes containing Elongin C internal deletion mutant C-(Δ71-80) are considerably more active than those containing C-(Δ81-90), even though Elongin ABC complexes containing C-(Δ81-90) contain more Elongin B and C. Thus, the results of these experiments demonstrate that assembly of Elongin C into the complete Elongin ABC complex is not sufficient for activation of Elongin A, and they indicate the importance of the C terminus of Elongin C for activation of Elongin A. Further evidence supporting the importance of the C terminus of Elongin C in activation of Elongin A came from analysis of a set of clustered alanine scanning mutants in which Elongin C residues between 89 and 112 were mutated three at a time to alanines. As predicted, all C-terminal alanine scanning mutants were capable of binding to Elongin B to form chromatographically isolable Elongin BC complexes (data not shown). In addition, although Elongin BC complexes containing three of these mutants, C-(Ala89-91), C-(Ala98-99), and C-(Ala108-109), were nearly as active as wild type BC complexes, the activity of BC complexes containing C-(Ala92-94), C-(Ala95-97), C-(Ala101-103), C-(Ala104-105), and C-(Ala110-112) was significantly impaired (Fig. 7). In this report, we have investigated the structure and function of Elongin C, a 112-amino acid subunit of the Elongin (SIII) complex (16Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Aso T. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Elongin (SIII) was initially purified from mammalian cells as a multimeric complex composed of A, B, and C subunits (10Bradsher J.N. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25587-25593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that Elongin A is the transcriptionally active subunit of Elongin (SIII) and that Elongin B and C regulate its activity by different mechanisms (16Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 17Garrett K.P. Aso T. Bradsher J.N. Foundling S.I.

Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). By virtue of its ability to bind directly to Elongin A in the absence of Elongin B to form an AC complex with increased specific activity, Elongin C appears to function as a bona fide activator of Elongin A. Elongin B does not appear to interact with Elongin A in the absence of Elongin C. Elongin B appears to play a chaperone-like role in formation in the Elongin (SIII) complex by binding directly to Elongin C and facilitating its interaction with Elongin A. As part of our effort to understand how Elongin C regulates the activity of the Elongin (SIII) complex, we have constructed and analyzed a systematic series of Elongin C mutants for their abilities to bind Elongin B and to bind and activate Elongin A under our assay conditions. Elongin C mutations were found to fall into several classes based on their effects on Elongin C activities (Fig. 8). First, the only Elongin C mutations that had dramatic effects on Elongin B binding fell within a short Elongin C region between amino acids 19 and 30, consistent with the possibility that sequences within this region are directly involved in interactions with Elongin B. Deletion mutations in this region, however, were also found to affect the ability of Elongin C to assemble into isolable Elongin ABC complexes and to activate Elongin A transcriptional activity. Thus, it is also possible that some mutations in this region disrupt the overall tertiary structure of Elongin C. Distinguishing between these possibilities must await more detailed structural studies of Elongin C and Elongin C-containing complexes. Second, the only Elongin C mutations that had dramatic effects on formation of isolable Elongin ABC complexes without affecting formation of Elongin BC complexes were mutations in the extreme C terminus of Elongin C. This result, together with our finding that all Elongin C internal deletion mutants, except C-(Δ21-30), were capable of forming isolable Elongin ABC complexes, suggests that the C terminus of Elongin C plays a crucial role in assembly of the Elongin ABC complex, possibly through direct interactions with Elongin A. Third, Elongin C mutations that affect formation of Elongin ABC complexes are only a subset of those mutations that affect activation of Elongin A, indicating that assembly of Elongin C into ABC complexes is not sufficient for activation of Elongin A. Interestingly, the size of the Elongin C region sensitive to mutations that affect activation of Elongin A was dependent on the assay used to measure activation. In one assay, which measured the ability of Elongin BC complexes to stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II in the presence of Elongin A, Elongin C mutations that fell within the entire C-terminal half of the protein (residues 61-112) drastically reduced Elongin C activity. In contrast, in a second assay, which measured the ability of preassembled Elongin ABC complexes to stimulate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II, Elongin C mutations that fell between residues 71 and 90 had a significantly reduced effect on Elongin C activity, indicating that sequences within this Elongin C region are not essential for activation of Elongin A. Finally, our previous analysis of the predicted open reading frame of the Elongin C cDNA revealed two notable features that suggested the existence of potentially important functional domains (16Garrett K.P. Tan S. Bradsher J.N. Lane W.S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5237-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). First, a FASTA search of the Swiss-Prot data base revealed that Elongin C amino acids 13-75 resemble a portion of the RNA binding domain of E. coli termination protein ρ. This region of ρ is believed to be involved in allosteric coupling of the ρ RNA binding and ATPase activities (29Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In light of our evidence that large portions of the ρ-like region can be deleted without affecting Elongin C activities, it is likely that the statistically significant sequence similarity between the two proteins does not reflect a similarity of function. Second, the extreme C terminus of Elongin C is predicted by both the Chou and Fasman (30Chou P.Y. Fasman G.T. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar) and Garnier et al. (31Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar) algorithms to form a short, hydrophobic α-helix that has the potential to form a coiled-coil protein-protein interaction domain (32Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2547) Google Scholar, 33O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). A similar short C-terminal α-helix with potential to form a coiled-coil has been shown to play a central role in protein-protein interactions involved in microtubule bundling (34Lewis S.A. Ivanov I.E. Lee G.-H. Cowan N.J. Nature. 1989; 342: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Our finding that mutations in the C-terminal tail of Elongin C do not affect its ability to bind Elongin B, but have dramatic effects on its ability to enter into Elongin ABC complexes and activate Elongin A, leave open the possibility that the potential hydrophobic α-helix at the C terminus of Elongin C could mediate protein-protein interactions with Elongin A.

https://openalex.org/W2140608510,"Simple tandem repeats of the trinucleotide sequence CAG encode homopolymeric stretches of glutamine. Although polyglutamine has been identified in diverse proteins, it is present predominantly in transcription factors. We observed that oncogene-immortalized mouse macrophages express several genes that contain a CAG repeat motif. Therefore, we attempted to clone a novel gene that contains a CAG repeat and is associated with cytokine activation of macrophages. Screening of a mouse macrophage cDNA library with a probe comprising 12 consecutive CAG triplets identified at least one unique clone. The cDNA encodes a protein (named GRP-1 or glutamine repeat protein-1) with 171 amino acids, a calculated molecular mass of 21.6 kDa, and a predicted pI of 10.67. Greater than two-thirds of GRP-1 are only two amino acids, namely glutamine (50%) and histidine (18%). There are four polyglutamine motifs interspersed with histidine-rich regions. There is also a putative nuclear localization signal flanked by sites for possible serine phosphorylation. GRP-1 mRNA was expressed constitutively in some macrophage cell lines and B and T cell lines. Interferon-γ or lipopolysaccharide augmented GRP-1 mRNA expression in the mouse macrophage cell line ANA-1. Western blot analyses using an antipeptide serum revealed that GRP-1 was localized in the nucleus of ANA-1 macrophages and transfected 3T3 fibroblasts. Overexpression of GRP-1 decreased Sp1-driven chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in transient cotransfection experiments. Because polyglutamine motifs can cause protein oligomerization and can function as transcriptional activation domains, we suggest that GRP-1 may be a transcription factor associated with interferon-γ- or lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of macrophages."
