https://openalex.org/W2119683782,"We report here the purification of the third protein factor, Apaf-3, that participates in caspase-3 activation in vitro. Apaf-3 was identified as a member of the caspase family, caspase-9. Caspase-9 and Apaf-1 bind to each other via their respective NH2-terminal CED-3 homologous domains in the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, an event that leads to caspase-9 activation. Activated caspase-9 in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3. Depletion of caspase-9 from S-100 extracts diminished caspase-3 activation. Mutation of the active site of caspase-9 attenuated the activation of caspase-3 and cellular apoptotic response in vivo, indicating that caspase-9 is the most upstream member of the apoptotic protease cascade that is triggered by cytochrome c and dATP."
https://openalex.org/W2152414109,"The existence of a common lymphoid progenitor that can only give rise to T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells remains controversial and constitutes an important gap in the hematopoietic lineage maps. Here, we report that the Lin(-)IL-7R(+)Thy-1(-)Sca-1loc-Kit(lo) population from adult mouse bone marrow possessed a rapid lymphoid-restricted (T, B, and NK) reconstitution capacity in vivo but completely lacked myeloid differentiation potential either in vivo or in vitro. A single Lin(-)IL-7R(+)Thy-1(-)Sca-1loc-Kit(lo) cell could generate at least both T and B cells. These data provide direct evidence for the existence of common lymphoid progenitors in sites of early hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973886069,"The INK4a tumor suppressor locus encodes p16 INK4a, an inhibitor of cyclin D-dependent kinases, and p19 ARF, an alternative reading frame protein that also blocks cell proliferation. Surprisingly, mice lacking p19 ARF but expressing functional p16 INK4a develop tumors early in life. Their embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) do not senesce and are transformed by oncogenic Ha-ras alone. Conversion of ARF+/+ or ARF+/− MEF strains to continuously proliferating cell lines involves loss of either p19 ARF or p53. p53-mediated checkpoint control is unperturbed in ARF-null fibroblast strains, whereas p53-negative cell lines are resistant to p19 ARF-induced growth arrest. Therefore, INK4a encodes growth inhibitory proteins that act upstream of the retinoblastoma protein and p53. Mutations and deletions targeting this locus in cancer cells are unlikely to be functionally equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W1976226379,"Mitochondrial physiology is disrupted in either apoptosis or necrosis. Here, we report that a wide variety of apoptotic and necrotic stimuli induce progressive mitochondrial swelling and outer mitochondrial membrane rupture. Discontinuity of the outer mitochondrial membrane results in cytochrome c redistribution from the intermembrane space to the cytosol followed by subsequent inner mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The mitochondrial membrane protein Bcl-xL can inhibit these changes in cells treated with apoptotic stimuli. In addition, Bcl-xL-expressing cells adapt to growth factor withdrawal or staurosporine treatment by maintaining a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Bcl-xL expression also prevents mitochondrial swelling in response to agents that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. These data suggest that Bcl-xL promotes cell survival by regulating the electrical and osmotic homeostasis of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2164618384,"Members of the Tc1/mariner superfamily of transposons isolated from fish appear to be transpositionally inactive due to the accumulation of mutations. Molecular phylogenetic data were used to construct a synthetic transposon, Sleeping Beauty, which could be identical or equivalent to an ancient element that dispersed in fish genomes in part by horizontal transmission between species. A consensus sequence of a transposase gene of the salmonid subfamily of elements was engineered by eliminating the inactivating mutations. Sleeping Beauty transposase binds to the inverted repeats of salmonid transposons in a substrate-specific manner, and it mediates precise cut-and-paste transposition in fish as well as in mouse and human cells. Sleeping Beauty is an active DNA-transposon system from vertebrates for genetic transformation and insertional mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008669330,"Leukocyte trafficking at the endothelium requires both cellular adhesion molecules and chemotactic factors. Fractalkine, a novel transmembrane molecule with a CX3C-motif chemokine domain atop a mucin stalk, induces both adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Here we identify a seven-transmembrane high-affinity receptor for fractalkine and show that it mediates both the adhesive and migratory functions of fractalkine. The receptor, now termed CX3CR1, requires pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein signaling to induce migration but not to support adhesion, which also occurs without other adhesion molecules but requires the architecture of a chemokine domain atop the mucin stalk. Natural killer cells predominantly express CX3CR1 and respond to fractalkine in both migration and adhesion. Thus, fractalkine and CX3CR1 represent new types of leukocyte trafficking regulators, performing both adhesive and chemotactic functions."
https://openalex.org/W2157116022,"Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) belongs to a group of bacterial pathogens that induce epithelial cell actin rearrangements resulting in pedestal formation beneath adherent bacteria. This requires the secretion of specific virulence proteins needed for signal transduction and intimate adherence. EPEC interaction induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein in the host membrane, Hp90, which is the receptor for the EPEC outer membrane protein, intimin. Hp90-intimin interaction is essential for intimate attachment and pedestal formation. Here, we demonstrate that Hp90 is actually a bacterial protein (Tir). Thus, this bacterial pathogen inserts its own receptor into mammalian cell surfaces, to which it then adheres to trigger additional host signaling events and actin nucleation. It is also tyrosine-phosphorylated upon transfer into the host cell."
https://openalex.org/W2099878990,"We have identified and characterized c-hairy1, an avian homolog of the Drosophila segmentation gene, hairy. c-hairy1 is strongly expressed in the presomitic mesoderm, where its mRNA exhibits cyclic waves of expression whose temporal periodicity corresponds to the formation time of one somite (90 min). The apparent movement of these waves is due to coordinated pulses of c-hairy1 expression, not to cell displacement along the anteroposterior axis, nor to propagation of an activating signal. Rather, the rhythmic c-hairy mRNA expression is an autonomous property of the paraxial mesoderm. These results provide molecular evidence for a developmental clock linked to segmentation and somitogenesis of the paraxial mesoderm, and support the possibility that segmentation mechanisms used by invertebrates and vertebrates have been conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2044386270,"We identified a complex in S. cerevisiae, the “exosome,” consisting of the five essential proteins Rrp4p, Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, and Rrp44p (Dis3p). Remarkably, four of these proteins are homologous to characterized bacterial 3′→5′ exoribonucleases; Rrp44p is homologous to RNase II, while Rrp41p, Rrp42p, and Rrp43p are related to RNase PH. Recombinant Rrp4p, Rrp44p, and Rrp41p are 3′→5′ exoribonucleases in vitro that have distributive, processive, and phosphorolytic activities, respectively. All components of the exosome are required for 3′ processing of the 5.8S rRNA. Human Rrp4p is found in a comparably sized complex, and expression of the hRRP4 gene in yeast complements the rrp4-1 mutation. We conclude that the exosome constitutes a highly conserved eukaryotic RNA processing complex."
https://openalex.org/W1547137876,"Oestrogen is considered to be the 'female' hormone, whereas testosterone is considered the 'male' hormone. However, both hormones are present in both sexes. Thus sexual distinctions are not qualitative differences, but rather result from quantitative divergence in hormone concentrations and differential expressions of steroid hormone receptors. In males, oestrogen is present in low concentrations in blood, but can be extraordinarily high in semen, and as high as 250 pg ml(-1) in rete testis fluids, which is higher than serum oestradiol in the female. It is well known that male reproductive tissues express oestrogen receptors, but the role of oestrogen in male reproduction has remained unclear. Here we provide evidence of a physiological role for oestrogen in male reproductive organs. We show that oestrogen regulates the reabsorption of luminal fluid in the head of the epididymis. Disruption of this essential function causes sperm to enter the epididymis diluted, rather than concentrated, resulting in infertility. This finding raises further concern over the potential direct effects of environmental oestrogens on male reproduction and reported declines in human sperm counts."
https://openalex.org/W2059344357,"We have isolated a novel otx-like homeobox gene, Crx, from the mouse retina. Crx expression is restricted to developing and mature photoreceptor cells. CRX bound and transactivated the sequence TAATCC/A, which is found upstream of several photoreceptor-specific genes, including the opsin genes from many species. Overexpression of Crx using a retroviral vector increased the frequency of clones containing exclusively rod photoreceptors and reduced the frequency of clones containing amacrine interneurons and Müller glial cells. In addition, presumptive photoreceptor cells expressing a dominant-negative form of CRX failed to form proper photoreceptor outer segments and terminals. Crx is a novel photoreceptor-specific transcription factor and plays a crucial role in the differentiation of photoreceptor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2145571109,"We have determined the crystal structure of the proteolytic component of the caseinolytic Clp protease (ClpP) from E. coli at 2.3 Å resolution using an ab initio phasing procedure that exploits the internal 14-fold symmetry of the oligomer. The structure of a ClpP monomer has a distinct fold that defines a fifth structural family of serine proteases but a conserved catalytic apparatus. The active protease resembles a hollow, solid-walled cylinder composed of two 7-fold symmetric rings stacked back-to-back. Its 14 proteolytic active sites are located within a central, roughly spherical chamber ∼51 Å in diameter. Access to the proteolytic chamber is controlled by two axial pores, each having a minimum diameter of ∼10 Å. From the structural features of ClpP, we suggest a model for its action in degrading proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2027066480,"Genes associated with inherited retinal degeneration have been found to encode proteins required for phototransduction, metabolism, or structural support of photoreceptors. Here we show that mutations in a novel photoreceptor-specific homeodomain transcription factor gene (CRX) cause an autosomal dominant form of cone-rod dystrophy (adCRD) at the CORD2 locus on chromosome 19q13. In affected members of a CORD2-linked family, the highly conserved glutamic acid at the first position of the recognition helix is replaced by alanine (E80A). In another CRD family, a 1 bp deletion (E168 [delta1 bp]) within a novel sequence, the WSP motif, predicts truncation of the C-terminal 132 residues of CRX. Mutations in the CRX gene cause adCRD either by haploinsufficiency or by a dominant negative effect and demonstrate that CRX is essential for the maintenance of mammalian photoreceptors."

https://openalex.org/W1965380392,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric hormone that induces proliferation of endothelial cells through binding to the kinase domain receptor and the Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor (Flt-1), the extracellular portions of which consist of seven immunoglobulin domains. We show that the second and third domains of Flt-1 are necessary and sufficient for binding VEGF with near-native affinity, and that domain 2 alone binds only 60-fold less tightly than wild-type. The crystal structure of the complex between VEGF and the second domain of Flt-1 shows domain 2 in a predominantly hydrophobic interaction with the “poles” of the VEGF dimer. Based on this structure and on mutational data, we present a model of VEGF bound to the first four domains of Flt-1."
https://openalex.org/W2006733565,"Filamentous invasive growth of S. cerevisiae requires multiple elements of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade that are also components of the mating pheromone response pathway. Here we show that, despite sharing several constituents, the two pathways use different MAP kinases. The Fus3 MAPK regulates mating, whereas the Kss1 MAPK regulates filamentation and invasion. Remarkably, in addition to their kinase-dependent activation functions, Kss1 and Fus3 each have a distinct kinase-independent inhibitory function. Kss1 inhibits the filamentation pathway by interacting with its target transcription factor Ste12. Fus3 has a different inhibitory activity that prevents the inappropriate activation of invasion by the pheromone response pathway. In the absence of Fus3, there is erroneous crosstalk in which mating pheromone now activates filamentation-specific gene expression using the Kss1 MAPK."
https://openalex.org/W2026817175,"Two new RNA structures portray how non-Watson-Crick base pairs and metal ions can produce a unique RNA shape suitable for recognition by proteins. The crystal structures of a 62 nt domain of E. coli 5S ribosomal RNA and a duplex dodecamer encompassing an internal loop E have been determined at 3.0 and 1.5 A, respectively. This loop E region is distorted by three ""cross-strand purine stacks"" and three novel, water-mediated noncanonical base pairs and stabilized by a four metal ion zipper. These features give its minor groove a unique hydrogen-bonding surface and make the adjacent major groove wide enough to permit recognition by the ribosomal protein L25, which is expected to bind to this surface."
https://openalex.org/W1989348835,"Mice carrying a null mutation in the mismatch repair gene Msh6 were generated by gene targeting. Cells that were homozygous for the mutation did not produce any detectable MSH6 protein, and extracts prepared from these cells were defective for repair of single nucleotide mismatches. Repair of 1, 2, and 4 nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatches was unaffected. Mice that were homozygous for the mutation had a reduced life span. The mice developed a spectrum of tumors, the most predominant of which were gastrointestinal tumors and B- as well as T-cell lymphomas. The tumors did not show any microsatellite instability. We conclude that MSH6 mutations, like those in some other members of the family of mismatch repair genes, lead to cancer susceptibility, and germline mutations in this gene may be associated with a cancer predisposition syndrome that does not show microsatellite instability."
https://openalex.org/W2094331166,"Chloroquine resistance in a P. falciparum cross maps as a Mendelian trait to a 36 kb segment of chromosome 7. This segment harbors cg2, a gene encoding a unique approximately 330 kDa protein with complex polymorphisms. A specific set of polymorphisms in 20 chloroquine-resistant parasites from Asia and Africa, in contrast with numerous differences in 21 sensitive parasites, suggests selection of a cg2 allele originating in Indochina over 40 years ago. One chloroquine-sensitive clone exhibited this allele, suggesting another resistance component. South American parasites have cg2 polymorphisms consistent with a separate origin of resistance. CG2 protein is found at the parasite periphery, a site of chloroquine transport, and in association with hemozoin of the digestive vacuole, where chloroquine inhibits heme polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2078957898,"Invasion of human mucosal cells by N. gonorrhoeae via the binding to heparansulfate proteoglycan receptors is considered a crucial event of the infection. Using different human epithelial cells and primary fibroblasts, we show here an activation of the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) and acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) by N. gonorrhoeae, resulting in the release of diacylglycerol and ceramide. Genetic and/or pharmacological blockade of ASM and PC-PLC cause inhibition of cellular invasion by N. gonorrhoeae. Complementation of ASM-deficient fibroblasts from Niemann-Pick disease patients restored N. gonorrhoeae-induced signaling and entry processes. The activation of PC-PLC and ASM, therefore, is an essential requirement for the entry of N. gonorrhoeae into distinct nonphagocytic human cell types including several epithelial cells and primary fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1998786976,"We demonstrate that the cytogenetically defined translocation t(X;1)(p11.2;p34) observed in papillary renal cell carcinomas results in the fusion of the splicing factor gene PSF located at 1p34 to the TFE3 helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene at Xp11.2. In addition we define an X chromosome inversion inv(X)(p11.2;q12) that results in the fusion of the NonO (p54nrb) gene to TFE3. NonO (p54nrb), the human homologue of the Drosophila gene NonAdiss which controls the male courtship song, is closely related to PSF and also believed to be involved in RNA splicing. In each case the rearrangement results in the fusion of almost the entire splicing factor protein to the TFE3 DNA-binding domain. These observations suggest the possibility of intriguing links between the processes of RNA splicing, DNA transcription and oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024685798,"The genetic alteration of p53 is associated with neovascularization during progression of glioma to its more malignant form, glioblastoma. Hence, one or more of the genes transactivated by p53 is likely to function as an angiogenesis inhibitors. We isolated a novel p53-inducible gene that encodes a 1584-amino-acid product containing five thrombospondin type 1 (TSP-type 1) repeats and is specifically expressed in the brain. A recombinant protein corresponding to the TSP-type 1 repeats of this gene product inhibited in vivo neovascularization induced by bFGF in the rat cornea. The expression of this gene, designated BAI1 (brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1) was absent or significantly reduced in eight of nine glioblastoma cell lines, suggesting BAI1 plays a significant role in angiogenesis inhibition, as a mediator of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2147715031,"E. coli cell division is mediated by the FtsZ ring and associated factors. Selection of the correct division site requires the combined action of an inhibitor of FtsZ ring formation (MinCD) and of a topological specificity factor that somehow prevents MinCD action at the middle of the cell (MinE). Here we show that a biologically active MinE-Gfp fusion accumulates in an annular structure near the middle of young cells. Formation of the MinE ring required MinD but was independent of MinC and continued in nondividing cells in which FtsZ function was inhibited. The results indicate that the MinE ring represents a novel cell structure, which allows FtsZ ring formation at midcell by suppressing MinCD activity at this site."
https://openalex.org/W2329193471,"Bcr-Abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that is expressed in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive human leukemias. Bcr-Abl has been shown to inhibit apoptosis and cause anchorage independent growth. However, its ability to activate mitogenic signaling pathways is controversial. Here we show that Bcr-Abl signaling prevents down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity and cell cycle arrest after growth factor deprivation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using an inducible system to regulate Bcr-Abl expression, we also demonstrate that Bcr-Abl expression is sufficient to induce G1-to-S phase transition, DNA synthesis, and activation of cyclin-dependent kinases in cells that were arrested in G0 by growth factor deprivation. Furthermore, Bcr-Abl activates Ras, Erk, and Jnk pathways as a primary consequence of expression. These data show that Bcr-Abl is one of a select group of oncogenes that is capable of both inhibiting apoptosis and deregulating cell proliferation. The combination of these activities is likely to be important for the progression of CML."
https://openalex.org/W2092381123,"Glutamate receptors of the kainate-preferring subtype have recently been shown to mediate synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. The low-affinity kainate receptor subunit GluR7 was found to be nonfunctional in previous studies. We report here that the GluR7 subunit and a novel carboxy-terminal splice variant, GluR7b, are functional glutamate receptors with unique pharmacological properties. In particular, glutamate exhibits a 10-fold lower potency for (non-desensitized) GluR7-mediated currents as compared to other non-NMDA receptor channels. These data will facilitate understanding of the distinct role played by GluR7 receptors in synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2091382604,"The roles of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine in behavior were investigated by targeted disruption of the dopamine β-hydroxylase (Dbh) gene, thereby eliminating these compounds in vivo. Most heterozygous pups born to Dbh−/− females died within several days of birth and were often found scattered within the bedding. Potential causes including deficits in olfaction and lactation were not apparent. A deficit in maternal behavior was confirmed by the lack of pup retrieval exhibited by Dbh−/− virgin females. Restoration of NE shortly before but not after birth induced females that previously abandoned their litters to act maternally. Our results suggest that NE is responsible for long-lasting changes that promote maternal behavior during both development and parturition in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2326487378,"Recent progress in deciphering the molecular basis of carcinogenesis is of utmost importance to the development of new anticancer strategies. To this end, it is essential to understand the regulation of both normal cell proliferation and its alterations in cancer cells. We have previously demonstrated that in ras-transformed cells there is an increased level of phosphorylcholine (PCho) resulting from a constitutive activation on choiline kinase (ChoK). The importance of ChoK for the regulation of cell proliferation has also been proposed since an inhibitor for this enzyme, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), drastically reduces entry into the S phase after stimulation with growth factors. Here we report the synthesis of several new compounds which are highly specific inhibitors for ChoK, with up to 1000-fold or 600-fold increased inhibitory activity, compared to HC-3 under ex vivo or in vitro conditions respectively. These novel compounds also drastically reduce entry into the S phase after stimulation with specific growth factors. A more profound inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in ras-, src- and mos-transformed cells in the presence of ChoK inhibitors, compared to their parental, untransformed NIH3T3 cells. By contrast, this effect was not observed in fos-transformed cells. While ras, src and mos transformation is associated with elevated levels of ChoK activity, fos-induced transformation does not affect ChoK activity. The inhibitory effect on proliferation of the new compounds correlates with their ability to inhibit the production of phosphorylcholine in whole cells, a proposed novel second messenger for cell proliferation. These results strongly support a critical role of choline kinase in the regulation of cell growth and makes this enzyme a novel target for the design of new antiproliferative and anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2127847492,"In S. cerevisiae, the four-protein Cbf3 complex binds to the essential CDEIII region of centromeric DNA to initiate kinetochore assembly. We report the reconstitution of Cbf3p from recombinant proteins and an analysis of its p58Ctf13 and p23Skp1 subunits. p23Skp1 has both G1- and G2-specific functions in yeast and binds to p58Ctf13 and to the essential Cdc4p component of the ubiquitin conjugating complex Scul(Cdc4). We show that the function of p23Skp1 in Cbf3p is to activate p58Ctf13 by phosphorylation. p58Ctf13 is an unstable protein that is targeted to the proteosome, probably by Scul(Cdc4)-mediated ubiquitination. Thus, p58 appears to be activated by phosphorylation in a p23Skp1-dependent step and degraded by the proteosome in a ubiquitin-dependent step. We propose that coupled activation and destruction link the assembly of Cbf3p to the duplication of centromeres in S phase."

https://openalex.org/W2041081452,"Fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF-7) or keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), is a potent and specific mitogen for epithelial cells. We have recently identified a novel human FGF-7 homologue, named FGF-10. To study the expression of this new FGF family member and its regulation in wound repair, we cloned the mouse FGF-10 (mFGF-10) cDNA. The encoded protein is 92% identical to human FGF-10 and 91% identical to rat FGF-10. When expressed in mammalian 293 cells, the mFGF-10 protein was glycosylated but remained cell- or extracellular matrix-associated. Upon addition of heparin, mFGF-10 protein was released into the media. mRNA encoding mFGF-10 was relatively abundant in lung, skin, brain and heart. In the skin, both FGF-7 and mFGF-10 were expressed in the dermal, but not the epidermal compartment. In contrast to FGF-7, mFGF-10 expression was not induced during cutaneous wound repair. In cultured fibroblasts, expression of mFGF-10 was strongly repressed by transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas epidermal growth factor and interleukin-1beta had no effect. These results demonstrate a differential regulation of mFGF-10 and FGF-7 expression in vitro and during the wound healing process."
https://openalex.org/W2118561918,"We have previously shown that ilimaquinone (IQ), a marine sponge metabolite, causes complete vesiculation of the Golgi stacks. By reconstituting the IQ-mediated vesiculation of the Golgi apparatus in permeabilized cells, we now demonstrate that this process does not require ARF and coatomers, which are necessary for the formation of Golgi-derived COPI vesicles. We find that IQ-mediated Golgi vesiculation is inhibited by Gαs-GDP and Gαi3-GDP. Interestingly, adding βγ subunits in the absence of IQ is sufficient to vesiculate Golgi stacks. Our findings reveal that IQ-mediated Golgi vesiculation occurs through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins and that it is the free βγ, and not the activated α subunit, that triggers Golgi vesiculation."
https://openalex.org/W2028886214,"The function of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is modulated by post-translational events, primarily by phosphorylation. p53 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by a variety of protein kinases depending on the cellular environment. It has been suggested that serine 34 of mouse p53 is specifically phosphorylated by a stress-activated protein kinase in response to ultraviolet radiation. Since serine 34 is a major site of phosphorylation of mouse p53 in vivo and its specific protein kinase is still not definitively identified yet, we have examined the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activity on p53 by expressing JNK1 in 293T cells. We show here that activated JNK1 phosphorylates mouse p53 specifically at serine 34 in vitro, while a dominanant-negative JNK1 mutant does not phosphorylate p53. More importantly, JNK1 associates with p53 in vivo, with or without activation, confirming that JNK1 is indeed a p53 kinase. Interestingly, activated JNK2 and JNK3 also phosphorylate serine 34 of mouse p53. Furthermore, JNK2 and JNK3 also associate with p53 in vivo, indicating that not only JNK1, but also JNK2 and JNK3 are p53 N-terminal serine 34 kinases. Phosphorylation of p53 by JNKs may play an important role in nuclear signal transduction in response to environmental stress or tumorigenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W2324450677,"The ERK, JNK/SAPK and p38/RK MAP kinase subtypes are differentially activated by physiological, pharmacological and stress stimuli; all three subtypes are implicated in immediate-early (IE) gene induction by these agents. Here, we have asked whether inhibition of a single MAP kinase subtype under these conditions would generally alter induction of several IE genes in a similar way or whether this would differentially up- and down-regulate particular IE genes, an issue which bears on the question of whether individual MAP kinases are strictly targeted to specific IE genes, or whether they might catalyse phosphorylation events that affect several IE genes in the same way. SB 203580, an inhibitor of p38/RK, has been used to analyse the role of this kinase in the induction of five IE genes (c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB and junD) under diverse conditions of stimulation. In C3H 10T½ cells, p38/RK and its downstream kinase MAPKAP K-2 are activated by all stimuli used with the exception of TPA. The specificity of SB 203580 as a p38/RK inhibitor in these cells is demonstrated; it does not affect ERKs or JNK/SAPKs but does result in a small increase in the activity of the upstream kinase MKK6, the principal p38/RK activator in these cells. We find that inhibition of p38/RK under these conditions produces general effects on all five IE genes as a group in three ways. First, induction of all five genes in response to okadaic acid or tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is not significantly altered by SB 203580. Second, in cells stimulated with anisomycin or U.V. radiation, SB 203580 potently inhibits all of the induced IE genes. Finally, SB 203580 enhances induction of all five IE genes in EGF-treated cells; these enhanced mRNA levels are not due to stabilisation of labile mRNA transcripts. The significance of these results to current thinking on the relationship between distinct MAP kinase subtypes and specific IE genes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2314507989,"Retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFNs) are negative regulators of cell proliferation. In vitro and in vivo, their combination leads to a more potent growth inhibition. However, the molecular mechanisms by which RA and IFNs potentiate each other are not fully understood. As some IFN-induced gene products regulate cell growth and/or antiviral activity, we analysed the effects of RA on their expressions. RA increases the level of 2'5'oligoadenylate synthetase, p68 kinase, the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and Sp100 in both HL-60 and WISH cells. Moreover, RA and IFN act cooperatively to increase the expression of these proteins. RA also inhibits vesicular stomatitis virus replication and induces a higher antiviral state and growth inhibition when combined with IFN. RA stimulates the IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) gene expression directly through the GAS motif and causes the induction and secretion of IFNalpha. Additional mechanisms could be involved as RA increases the level of signal transducing activators of transcription (STAT) proteins, and enhances the IFN-induced STAT activation, suggesting that cooperative effects by RA and IFN are mediated through multiple pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2092638377,"Using differential display, we identified an mRNA that is markedly down-regulated in cell line 6A/SB1, derived from a fibrosarcoma formed in an athymic mouse following injection of carcinogen-transformed MSU-1.1 cells. The nontumorigenic parental cell strain, MSU-1.1, expresses high levels of this mRNA. Sequencing of the corresponding cDNA fragment revealed that it corresponded to an expressed sequence tag, which ultimately led to its identification as the fibulin-1D gene. Fibulin-1 is a cysteine-rich, calcium-binding extracellular matrix and plasma protein, which has four isoforms, A-D, derived from alternative splicing. Northern and Western blotting analysis of 16 cell lines established from tumors formed in athymic mice by MSU-1.1-derived cell strains independently transformed in culture showed that 44% exhibited low level or lack of expression of fibulin-1D mRNA and protein. In a similar analysis of 15 malignant cell lines derived from patients, 80% showed low level or no expression. To study the role of fibulin-1D in transformation, we transfected 6A/SB1 cells and a human fibrosarcoma-derived cell line (SHAC) with a fibulin-1D cDNA expression construct. Transfectants displaying high levels of fibulin-1D were isolated and characterized. Elevated expression of fibulin-1D led to reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar and reduced invasive potential as tested in a matrigel in vitro invasion assay. Furthermore, expression of fibulin-1D resulted in a markedly extended latency in tumor formation in athymic mice. These results indicate that low expression of fibulin-1D plays a role in tumor formation and invasion."

https://openalex.org/W2330440529,"We report here that interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) induce formation of a complex composed of two SH2-containing phosphatases, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and the SH2 containing inositol 5-phosphatase (SHIP). Both SHP-2 and SHIP are known to be involved in growth factor signal transduction, but their potential interaction in the same pathway is novel. SHIP has previously been shown to associate with SHC, and potentially to be involved in regulating apoptosis. In contrast, in some model systems, SHP-2 has been demonstrated to positively regulate cell growth. Both phosphatases in the complex were tyrosine phosphorylated, and the amount of SHIP coprecipitating with SHP-2 was inversely related to the amount of SHIP coprecipitating with SHC. In hematopoietic cells transformed by the BCR/ABL oncogene, this phosphatase complex was found to be constitutively present with both components heavily tyrosine phosphorylated. Also, other proteins were detected in the complex, including BCR/ABL itself and c-CBL. However, transformation by BCR/ABL was associated with a reduced SHIP protein expression, which could further affect the accumulation of various inositol polyphosphates in these leukemic cells. These data suggest that the function of SHIP and SHP-2 in normal cells are linked and that BCR/ABL alters the function of this signaling complex."

https://openalex.org/W2049832496,"Connexin genes exert negative growth control when transfected into various types of tumor cell lines. We previously demonstrated that connexin 26 (Cx26) suppresses in vitro and in vivo growth of HeLa cells. In this study, we have examined whether certain Cx26 mutants can abrogate cell growth control and the gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) capacity of such Cx26-transfected HeLa cells. For this purpose, we transfected three mutated Cx26 genes (C60F, P87L and R143W) into HeLa cells already containing the wild-type Cx26 gene, which are GJIC-competent and non-tumorigenic. Transfection of P87L and R143W mutants enhanced the tumorigenicity of the HeLa Cx26 cells in nude mice without any change in GJIC capacity. On the other hand, transfection of the C60F mutant reduced the GJIC capacity of HeLa Cx26 cells without affecting their growth in vivo. Immunostaining studies demonstrated that the Cx26 proteins were localized mainly at cell-cell contact areas in the HeLa Cx26 cells both before and after transfection of mutated Cx26 genes. These results suggest that certain mutant Cx26 proteins exert a dominant-negative effect on Cx26-regulated growth of HeLa cells and that such effects may be independent of the effect on GJIC ability. It is proposed that wild-type and mutant Cx26 proteins produce heteromeric connexons and that such heteromeric connexons may exert different effects on growth control from those of homomeric connexons."

https://openalex.org/W2329925702,Evidence is presented for the existence of a novel remodeling-by-deletion mechanism that alters the fine structure of c-myc-deregulating chromosomal translocations in t(12;15)-positive BALB/c plasmacytomas. DNA sequence analysis of the t(12;15) in five primary tumors revealed the co-existence of precursor cells harboring genetic recombinations between the immunoglobulin heavy-chain mu locus (Igh mu) and c-myc with clonally related progenitors containing rearrangements between the immunoglobulin heavy-chain alpha locus (Igh alpha) and c-myc. Clonal relatedness was based upon unique junction fragments between the switch region of Igh mu and c-myc. S mu/c-myc junctions are thus useful clonotypic markers for monitoring the conversion of Igh mu/c-myc-positive tumor precursor clones into Igh alpha/c-myc-positive plasmacytomas. Aberrant isotype switch recombination appears to be the most likely mechanism effecting this conversion event (other possibilities are discussed) which may help to explain the preferred usage of the Igh alpha locus in recombinations with c-myc in t(12;15)-positive plasma cell tumors in BALB/c mice.
https://openalex.org/W2332359486,"The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex is composed of a catalytic (DNA-PKcs), and a regulatory subunit (Ku70/Ku86 heterodimer). The expression and function of DNA-PK subunits was investigated in purified blood lymphocytes obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) either refractory to chemotherapy or untreated. Variations in DNA-PK activity were found amongst CLL samples by comparison to human cell lines. It was noticeable that the low DNA-PK activity was associated with samples from untreated patients that exhibited a sensitivity phenotype, determined in vitro, to the radiomimetic agent neocarcinostatin by comparison to samples from refractory patients. The regulation in DNA-PK activity was associated with Ku heterodimer expression while DNA-PKcs was unaffected. Moreover, the presence of an altered form of the Ku86 subunit was identified in samples with low DNA-PK activity. These results suggest a regulation process of the DNA-PK activity in fresh human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2327762367,"Expression levels of human papillomavirus type 1 late genes are determined in part by an AU-rich inhibitory sequence in the 3′ untranslated region on the late mRNAs. Fine mapping of the AU rich inhibitory sequence revealed that it mapped to a 57 nucleotide sequence, consisting of an AU-rich region containing two AUUUA motifs and a U-rich region containing three UUUUU motifs. An internal deletion showed that the U-rich region was required for inhibition. Point mutations in the AUUUA- and UUUUU-motifs inactivated the inhibitory sequence. Analysis of the stability of mRNAs containing the AU-rich sequence in sense or anti-sense orientation showed that mRNAs containing the AU-rich sequence in sense orientation had reduced half life. Analysis of RNA-protein interactions revealed that binding to the inhibitory sequence of three poly(U) binding proteins (38, 44 and 46 kDa) correlated with inhibition and that the same proteins bind to the AU-rich mRNA instability element in the 3′ untranslated region on the human c-fos mRNA. We speculate that the human papillomavirus late mRNAs, produced from several hundred copies of the virus genome present in infected cells, compete with the c-fos mRNAs for destabilizing cellular factors and that this may lead to elevated Fos protein levels in human papillomavirus infected cells"

https://openalex.org/W2019714026,"We demonstrated previously that the activation of v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) in IC.DP murine pre-mast cells resulted in suppression of apoptosis after withdrawal of interleukin 3 (IL-3), that protein kinase C (PKC) translocated to the nucleus 6 h after v-Abl PTK activation and that inhibition of PKC restored apoptosis after IL-3 deprivation in the presence of v-Abl PTK activity. Here we demonstrate that v-Abl PTK activation is followed by an approximately twofold increase in mRNA level of Bcl-XL by 6 h and a corresponding increase in Bcl-XL protein level by 24 h. Bcl-xL RNA and protein decreased in IL-3 deprived cells in the absence of v-Abl PTK activity. Exposure of cells with v-Abl PTK active to the PKC inhbitor calphostin C (125 ng/ml) prevented the increase in Bcl-xL protein and resulted in apoptosis. No changes in Bax or Bcl-2 protein level were noted after IL-3 withdrawal and/or activation of v-Abl PTK. Bak was barely detectable and Bad protein level decreased in cells undergoing apoptosis. The data suggest that suppression of apoptosis by v-Abl PTK in the absence of IL-3 is associated with PKC signalling and the upregulation of Bcl-xL in IC.DP cells."
https://openalex.org/W2330018667,"p53 is a nuclear protein that acts like a tumor suppressor and is involved in regulation of cellular growth. In Xenopus, the p53 protein is highly expressed during oogenesis and is strictly cytoplasmic in the oocyte. We have analysed its participation in DNA replication and transcription during early development, using the egg and oocyte as model-systems. The injection of sperm nuclei into Xenopus eggs is followed by DNA replication and mitotic events. We show that the endogenous p53 enters the nuclei and moves through a series of discrete sub-nuclear loci whose distribution is S-phase specific. A specific peripheral nuclear localization of p53 is observed before entry into S-phase, followed by an internal localization which is strictly dependent on ongoing DNA synthesis. At no stage in the cell cycle, however, did we observe any co-localization with RPA or PCNA, which were used as initiation or elongation markers for DNA replication. We also show that injection into the nucleus of the oocyte of small amounts of either Xenopus or human p53 – less than 10% of the cytoplasmic storage – is sufficient to block RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription from a coinjected TATA-box-containing reporter plasmid. Transcription is rescued by microinjection of the TATA-box binding protein (TBP), suggesting that nuclear exclusion of p53 during oogenesis may be necessary for transcription of maternal genes. These characteristics are discussed in relation to the regulation of nuclear activities during early embryogenesis."
