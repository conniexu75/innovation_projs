https://openalex.org/W2005093233,"The upper temperature for superconductivity in organic conductors has increased from 1 kelvin in 1980, when the phenomenon was discovered in the quasi—one-dimensional cation radical salt tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene phosphorus heptafluoride to 12 kelvin in a new series of organic salts that show nearly two-dimensional electronic properties. These superconductors are attracting interest because of the wide range of new phenomena that they exhibit, including the competition between various ground states, the influence of a magnetic field on a quasi—one-dimensional conductor, the quantization of the Hall effect in a three-dimensional material, the giant magnetoresistance effects related to the two-dimensional nature of the Fermi surface of some materials, and the coherent voltage oscillation of a spin-modulated ground state. Furthermore, there is reason to believe that organic conductors with high superconducting transition temperatures could be produced in the near future. The recent finding of superconductivity in ""fullerene"" doped with alkali metals supports this optimism."
https://openalex.org/W2017860134,"Recent advances in the design and synthesis of organic synthetic metals have yielded materials that have the highest superconducting transition temperatures (T(c) approximately 13 kelvin) reported for these systems. These materials have crystal structures consisting of alternating layers of organic donor molecules and inorganic anions. Organic superconductors have various electronic and magnetic properties and crystal structures that are similar to those of the inorganic copper oxide superconductors (which have high T(c) values); these similarities include highly anisotropic conductivities, critical fields, and short coherence lengths. The largest number of organic superconductors, including those with the highest T(c) values, are charge-transfer salts derived from the electron donor molecule BEDT-TTF or ET [bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene]. The synthesis and crystal structures of these salts are discussed; their electrical, magnetic, and band electronic structure properties and their many similarities to the copper oxide superconductors are treated as well."
https://openalex.org/W2073828772,"A crystalline counterionic layer at the interface between an electrolyte solution and a charged layer of insoluble amphiphilic molecules was observed with grazing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction. Uncompressed arachidic films spread over 10(-3) molar cadmium chloride solution (pH 8.8) spontaneously form crystalline clusters with coherence lengths of approximately 1000 angstroms at 9 degrees C. Ten distinct diffraction peaks were observed, seven of which were attributed to scattering only from a crystalline Cd(2+) layer and the other three to scattering primarily from the arachidate layer. The reflections from the Cd(2+) layer were indexed according to a 2 x 3 supercell of the arachidate lattice with three Cd(2+) ions per cadmium unit cell."
https://openalex.org/W2011903534,"40Ar/39Ar dating of tektites discovered recently in Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary marine sedimentary rocks on Haiti indicates that the K-T boundary and impact event are coeval at 64.5 ± 0.1 million years ago. Sanidine from a bentonite that lies directly above the K-T boundary in continental, coal-bearing, sedimentary rocks of Montana was also dated and has a 40Ar/39Ar age of 64.6 ± 0.2 million years ago, which is indistinguishable statistically from the age of the tektites."
https://openalex.org/W2016830514,"The detection by the Roentgen satellite (ROSAT) x-ray telescope of a shadow in the 1/4-kiloelectron volt (C band, 0.1 to 0.284 kiloelectron volt) cosmic diffuse background is reported. The location and morphology of the local minimum in x-rays are in clear agreement with a discrete H I cloud. The shadow is very deep with a minimum level at 50 percent of the surrounding emission; therefore, a minimum of 50 percent of the observed off-cloud flux must originate on the far side of the cloud. The analysis of H I velocity components links the cloud with the Draco nebula (distance approximately 600 parsecs); it then follows that there is significant 1/4-kiloelectron volt x-ray emission at a large distance (>400 parsecs) from the galactic plane along this line of sight. The extent of the distant emission region is uncertain, and, if it indicates the existence of a hot galactic corona, it must be patchy in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2059183651,"Extensive dark smoke clouds associated with burning oil wells in Kuwait have been seen in data from weather satellites since early February 1991. The smoke is dispersed over a wide area. Variable and strong low level winds have held most of the smoke plume below 3 to 5 kilometers within a few hundred kilometers of the source. Thin veils of smoke have been detected in METEOSAT data as far away as 2000 kilometers east of Kuwait, over southwestern Pakistan at heights between 6 and 7 kilometers. The occasional presence of convective clouds over the fires indicates that some scavenging of the smoke is taking place."

Thus C. arctostaphyli is eliminated as the only familiar exception to Transhel's law, which may apply universally to microcyclic rusts."
