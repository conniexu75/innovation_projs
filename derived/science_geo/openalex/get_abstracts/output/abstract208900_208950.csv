Electron micrographs of a partially purified preparation show that the viral particle has an icosahedral structure about 66 mmicro in diameter."

Inactivity appears not to involve one entire X chromosome; furthermore, even those parts of the chromosome that can change to an inactive state spread inactivation not to the entire attached piece of autosome, but along a gradient to limited distances."

https://openalex.org/W2081456823,"THE adenosine triphosphatase activity of stromata prepared from human red cells has recently been thoroughly investigated by Post et al.1 and by Dunham and Glynn2. The authors were able to demonstrate that in this ATPase, which is activated by magnesium and shows optimal efficacy at pH 7, two fractions can be distinguished, one being activated by calcium and another being inhibited by calcium and activated by sodium and potassium. The part activated by sodium and potassium amounts to 30–50 per cent of the total, and is further characterized by being inhibited by cardiac glycosides. It thus shows striking similarity to the ATPase present in submicroscopic particles isolated from crab nerve sheaths as studied by Skou3,4. The dependence of these enzymes on sodium and potassium and their sensitivity towards cardiac glycosides strongly suggest that they play a part in the active transport of sodium and potassium through the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1554977141,"It is now generally agreed that papain possesses a single reactive sulfhydryl group which is essential for activity and which probably participates in the catalytic mechanism by forming acyl intermediates with the different substrates (2, 3). Smith (4) has claimed that the essential sulfhydryl group of papain is kinetically more active than most protein sulfhydryl groups and that it possesses different chemical properties. On the basis of indirect evidence, it was suggested that this sulfhydryl group is present in the form of an internal thioester (4), and the reaction mechanism recently advocated by Smith (4) was based on this concept. The study of the reactivity and chemical properties of the active -SH group of crystalline papain has so far been complicated by the fact that the preparations obtained were active only after addition of reducing substances (5) or when subjected to reducing procedures (6, 7). In this investigation, crystalline papain was obtained which was active without any special pretreatment or additions. This fact made it possible to study, in the absence cf interfering substances, the reactivity of the active -SH group of papain towards different types of sulfhydryl reagents. Also, the mechanism of papain activation, which is not clearly understood (3), has been investigated. The quantitative data presented here confirm the view that the -SH group of papain is highly reactive. However, they fail to support the hypothesis that it is present in the form of an internal thioester. The kinetic studies indicate that thiols may activate papain in part by increasing the rate of decomposition of the enzyme-substrate complex."

https://openalex.org/W2079980778,Starch-gel electrophoresis of an extract of mouse kidney disclosed that an esterase is present in mature males but absent in females and immature males. When testosterone was injected for 7 days the enzyme could be detected in kidney extracts obtained from both female and young animals. Hence the enzyme may be a hormone-induced one.

The number of spikes in a response train was 4 to 15, the duration 3 to 4 msec, the height 0.5 to 2 mv. The height of successive spikes in a train decreased. The decrement in height, the number, and the frequency of spikes changed with the strength of the odor."

https://openalex.org/W1996054325,"FŒTAL bradycardia during labour is usually taken to be a sign of ‘fœtal distress’, its occurrence being interpreted as a consequence of fœtal hypoxia. Beard1 has recently considered the possibility of an endogenous humoral agent such as noradrenaline in the maternal circulation contributing to, or causing, this type of fœtal response. After injecting noradrenaline into the pregnant human subject, he noted a transitory fœtal bradycardia but was not able to decide from his results whether this effect stemmed from uterine vasoconstriction with subsequent fœtal hypoxia or from a direct action of noradrenaline on the fœtal cardiovascular system."

https://openalex.org/W1972367123,"THE prevalence and magnitude of the effects of oxygen on radiosensitivity have been reviewed by Gray1. No other chemical moiety has been reported to exert a greater influence during the period of irradiation. Many investigators accept this ‘oxygen effect’ as the principal mechanism of radioprotection, and tend to relate the action of all chemical protectants to a simple reduction of oxygen tension. However, observations of the effect of varying oxygen tensions on the radioprotective action of thiols are controversial. For example, breathing oxygen under pressure during the period of irradiation tends to antagonize the protective action of cysteamine and cysteine in rats2. In contrast, cysteamine itself appears to increase oxygen tension in the spleen and bone marrow3, thus indicating that its protection is not mediated by hypoxia of these radiosensitive tissues. Measuring oxygen tension in tissue by the use of microelectrodes presents numerous problems and the variable results may explain the foregoing observations. Recent work by Vergroesen4 demonstrated cysteamine protects mammalian cells against radiation even in the presence of complete anoxia, and suggests that the same may be true for mammals. Previous attempts to study the combined effect of low oxygen tension and thiols in the radioprotection of mice were conducted with less than optimal hypoxia5. We have re-examined the problem by comparing the 30-day survival of mice irradiated while breathing 5 per cent oxygen, to those irradiated while protected by combinations of hypoxia and chemical agents."

Sulphydryl compounds given immediately before1,2, hypoxia induced during3, or infusion of syngeneic bone marrow given after4 irradiation all afford major degrees of protection. If each of these agents acted by an independent mechanism, then the LD50/30 days dose might be expected to be increased by as much as six to eight fold when all were used together. We now report the results of combining these factors."
https://openalex.org/W2071767021,"IT has been clearly established in mummified and other dried human material that the connective tissues are frequently well preserved while the epithelia are less-often recognizable1,2. This is probably a reflexion of relative susceptibility to any autolysis which may precede effective desiccation. Neurovascular bundles are readily recognized in some Egyptian mummies and in dried bodies from other ancient cultures; for this reason direct study of vascular disease in antiquity is possible1,3,4. Nevertheless, desiccation produces considerable distortion of blood vessels, and interpretation of changes and elimination of artefact is greatly aided by delineation of elastic fibres, which are valuable landmarks in vessel structure."
