https://openalex.org/W1984328656,"Advanced human cancers are invariably aneuploid, in that they harbour cells with abnormal chromosome numbers1,2. However, the molecular defects underlying this trait, and whether they are a cause or a consequence of the malignant phenotype, are not clear. Mutations that disable the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway are also common in human cancers1. These mutations promote tumour development by deregulating the E2F family of transcription factors leading to uncontrolled cell cycle progression3. We show that the mitotic checkpoint protein Mad2 is a direct E2F target and, as a consequence, is aberrantly expressed in cells with Rb pathway defects. Concordantly, Mad2 is overexpressed in several tumour types, where it correlates with high E2F activity and poor patient prognosis. Generation of Rb pathway lesions in normal and transformed cells produces aberrant Mad2 expression and mitotic defects leading to aneuploidy, such that elevated Mad2 contributes directly to these defects. These results demonstrate how chromosome instability can arise as a by-product of defects in cell cycle control that compromise the accuracy of mitosis, and suggest a new model to explain the frequent appearance of aneuploidy in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2049667730,"The oncoprotein MDM2 associates with ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23. Both L11 and L23 have been shown to activate p53 by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 suppression. Here we have shown that L5 also activates p53. Overexpression of L5 stabilized ectopic p53 in H1299 cells and endogenous p53 in U2OS cells. Consequently, L5 enhanced p53 transcriptional activity and induced p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, like L11 and L23, L5 also remarkably inhibited MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. The interaction of L5 with MDM2 was also enhanced by treatment with a low dose of actinomycin D. Actinomycin D-induced p53 was inhibited by small interference RNA against L5. By reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation, we further showed that there were at least two MDM2-ribosomal protein complexes in cells: MDM2-L5-L11-L23 and p53-MDM2-L5-L11-L23. We propose that the MDM2-L5-L11-L23 complex functions to inhibit MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and thus activates p53. The oncoprotein MDM2 associates with ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23.

Neel H. Marechal V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, p53 is short-lived mainly because of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Under pathological conditions, the half-life of p53 is prolonged because multiple cellular pathways are activated to prevent MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, consequently leading to p53 activation (2Brooks C.L. Gu W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). In addition to induction of many p53-responsive genes, including those involved in cell cycle and apoptotic regulation, activated p53 also induces transcription of MDM2, which in turn suppresses p53 function. Hence, tight regulation of this MDM2-p53 feedback pathway is critically important for a cell to respond to various stresses. An example of such stress is ribosomal biogenesis stress. In response to the ribosomal biogenesis stress caused by either a low dose (5 nm) of actinomycin D (Act D) 1The abbreviations used are: Act D: actinomycin D; siRNA: small interference RNA; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescence protein; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. or overexpression of the mutant Bop1, a nucleolar protein critical for rRNA processing and ribosome assembly, p53 is activated and induces cell growth arrest at the G1 phase (3Ashcroft M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29617-29625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Ironically, this activation does not appear to require posttranslational modifications of p53, such as phosphorylation (6Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Instead, recent studies by several groups, including ours, suggest that association of the ribosomal proteins L11 and L23 with MDM2 might be responsible for p53 activation after Act D treatment (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Lohrum M.A. Ludwig R.L. Kubbutat M.H. Hanlon M. Vousden K.H.

Biol. 2003; 23: 8902-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). L11 and L23 can bind to MDM2 directly, and this binding is enhanced in response to Act D treatment. RNA interference against L23 can block Act D-induced p53 activation, demonstrating that L23 is required for p53 activation in response to ribosomal biogenesis stress (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Another ribosomal protein, L5, has also been shown to bind to MDM2 in vitro and in cells (10Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Piette J. Nicolas J.C. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 11Elenbaas B. Dobbelstein M. Roth J. Shenk T. Levine A.J. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 439-451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is still puzzling whether L5, like L11 and L23, can activate p53 by inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination. It is also unclear whether these three ribosomal proteins can form a single complex with MDM2 to inhibit its ubiquitin ligase activity toward p53 in cells. To address these issues, we have performed a series of cellular experiments. Our studies demonstrate that L5 can also activate p53 and induce p53-dependent G1 arrest in response to Act D-induced ribosomal biogenesis stress. Additionally, a set of reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments reveals that L5, L11, and L23 appear to bind to MDM2 simultaneously, forming one quadruple complex in cells. The steady state level of the complex is reduced in the presence of p53, suggesting that the ribosomal proteins may compete with p53 for MDM2. Thus, our study shows that the three ribosomal proteins inhibit MDM2 function by forming a complex with MDM2. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Antibodies—Human 293, H1299, U2OS, Saos-2, and SJSA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum as previously described (7Dai M.S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To generate human L5 expression construct pcDNA3–2FLAG-L5, the full-length L5 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from HeLa cell mRNA using primers P1, 5′-CGCGG-ATCCATGGGGTTTGTTAAAGTTG-3′, and P2, 5′-CCGGAATTCTTAGCTCTCAGCAGCCCGCTC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3–2FLAG vector in BamHI and EcoRI sites. The pEGFP-L5 was cloned by inserting the PCR product using primers P3, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGGGGTTTGTTAAAGTTG-3′, and P4, 5′-CGCGGATCCTTAGCTCTCAGCAGCCCGCTC-3′ into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) in EcoRI and BamHI sites. GST-MDM2 and His-MDM2 bacterial expression vectors were described previously (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

The His-tagged L5 bacteria expression vector pet24a-His-L5 was cloned by PCR using primers P1 and P5, 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGCTCTCAGCAGCCCGCTC-3′, into pet24a-His vector in BamHI and EcoRI sites. For generation of the polyclonal anti-L5 antibody, His-tagged full-length L5 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads, and used as an antigen to raise rabbit polyclonal anti-L5 antisera. Anti-L23 and anti-L11 polyclonal antibodies were described (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

Anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-p21cip1 (NeoMarkers), anti-p53 (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal anti-MDM2 (Santa Cruz) were purchased. Monoclonal anti-MDM2 (2A10 and 4B11) and anti-HA (12CA5) have been previously described (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Beads were washed with lysis buffer twice, once with SNNTE buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 750 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 1%, sodium deoxycholate), and once with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblot using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Lysis buffer, SNNTE, radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and Buffer C 100 (BC100) (containing 20 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 mmol/liter EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mmol/liter KCl, 4 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter PMSF, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mg/ml pepstatin A) were described (7Dai M.S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). GST Fusion Protein Association Assays—His-tagged L5, L11, L23, and MDM2 proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and eluted by 0.5 m imidazole. Protein-protein interaction assays were conducted as described (13Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified His-tagged L5, L11, or L23 proteins were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) containing 200 ng of GST-MDM2 or GST, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. The mixtures were then washed once in BC100 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, twice in SNNTE, and once in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed on a 12% SDS gel and detected by immunoblot using anti-His, anti-L11, anti-L23, or anti-MDM2 (2A10) antibody. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assays—U2OS or Saos-2 cells were transfected with the pCMV-β-galactoside reporter plasmid (0.1 μg) and a luciferase reporter plasmid (0.1 μg) driven by two copies of the p53RE motif derived from the MDM2 promoter (15Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar), together with a combination of different plasmids (total plasmid DNA 1 μg/well) as indicated in Fig. 2B, using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). 48 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assays as described previously (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 14Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized by a factor of β-galactosidase activity in the same assay. Cell Cycle Analysis—U2OS or Saos-2 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP or GFP-L5. 32 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 200 μg/ml nocodazole for an additional 16 h. Cells were stained in 500 μl of propidium iodide (Sigma) stain buffer and analyzed for DNA content using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer as described (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 14Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Data were collected using the ModFit software program. GFP-positive cells were gated for cell cycle analysis. Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy minikits. Reverse transcriptions were performed as described (14Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PCR reactions were performed in a 20-μl mixture containing 1× PCR buffer, 60 μmol/liter of dNTPs, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 μmol/liter of each primer, and 0.2 μCi of [32P]dCTP for 18–20 cycles as described (14Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). PCR products were resolved onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and followed by autoradiography. The primers for amplifying p21cip1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were described (14Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Keller D.M. Lu H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5487-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The primers for amplifying p53 were 5′-TACAGTCAGAGCCAACCTCAG-3′ and 5′-AGATGAAGCTCCCAGAATGCC-3′. In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—H1299 cells were transfected with His6 ubiquitin (2 μg), p53 (2 μg), Ha-MDM2 (2 μg), and L5 (1, 2 μg) expression plasmids as indicated in figure legend 4 using Lipofectin. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and split into two aliquots, one for immunoblot and the other for ubiquitination assays. The in vivo ubiquitination assay was conducted as previously described (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 12Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblot with monoclonal p53 antibodies (DO-1; Santa Cruz). Introduction of siRNA against L5 into Human Cells Followed by Treatment with Act D—RNA interference-mediated ablation of endogenous L5 was performed essentially as previously described (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 16Nikolaev A.Y. Li M. Puskas N. Qin J. Gu W. Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes with a 3′ dTdT overhang, corresponding to L5 mRNA (AAGGGAGCTGTGGATGGAGGC), or the scramble II RNA duplex (AAGCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTC) as a control were synthesized (Dhamacon). These siRNA duplexes (0.2 μm) were introduced into U2OS cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were then treated either with or without 5 nm Act D for 8 h before harvesting. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for immunoblot analysis. To determine the global protein synthesis after L5 siRNA treatment, U2OS cells were transfected with either L5 siRNA or scramble RNA as above. The cells were directly lysed, and equal amounts (10 μg) of total protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel followed by silver staining. Alternatively, the cells were starved in a methionine-free medium for 30 min followed by pulse labeling with 50 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine for 30 min. The cells were lysed, and equal amounts of total proteins were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was incubated in an Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. L5 Interacts with MDM2 in Cells and in Vitro—We previously identified an MDM2 complex that contains ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 from cytoplasmic fractions of a stable HA-MDM2-expressing 293 cell line (293-HA-MDM2) using immunoaffinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Consistent with an early report (10Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Piette J. Nicolas J.C. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we also found that L5 directly bound to MDM2. Ectopically expressed FLAG-L5 and HA-MDM2 were co-immunoprecipitated in 293 cells with antibodies against HA or FLAG, but not the control antibody (Fig. 1A). Because it has not been determined whether endogenous L5 and MDM2 proteins bind to each other, we generated polyclonal anti-L5 antibodies to test this unsolved issue. The antibody specifically recognized a band at ∼35 kDa, the predicted size for L5, in 293 cells (Fig. 1B, lane 1), as well as the ectopically expressed FLAG-L5 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). This antibody also specifically detected endogenous L5 co-immunoprecipitated by anti-MDM2, but not control antibody, in SJSA cells, which expressed a relatively high level of endogenous MDM2 (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Also, L5, like L11 (Fig. 1F, second panel) and L23 (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), directly interacted with MDM2 in vitro as shown in Fig. 1F using glutathione S-transferase fusion MDM2-protein association assays. To determine where the L5-MDM2 binding occurs in cells, we prepared both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of lysates from 293-HA-MDM2 cells. HA-MDM2 was expressed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus as shown by immunoblot (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 4) and by immunofluorescence staining (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of both fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-L5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, HA-MDM2 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-L5 in both fractions. Furthermore, we introduced FLAG-L5 together with wild type MDM2 or its nuclear localization sequence deletion mutant (MDM2Δ 150–230) into 293 cells. Cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 1E, both MDM2Δ 150–230 and wild type MDM2 were co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. It is worth noting that the level of this deletion mutant was apparently lower than that of wild type MDM2 because of its rapid degradation in the cytoplasm (12Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because the Δ150–320 mutant of MDM2 is localized only in the cytoplasm (12Jin Y. Lee H. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Lu H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6365-6377Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and L5 is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (data not shown), these results indicate that L5 can bind to MDM2 in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Ectopic Expression of L5 Induces p53 Transcriptional Activity and G1 Cell Cycle Arrest—We (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and others (8Lohrum M.A. Ludwig R.L. Kubbutat M.H. Hanlon M. Vousden K.H. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Wolf G.W. Bhat K. Jin A. Allio T. Burkhart W.A. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8902-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of either L11 or L23 induces p53 transcriptional activity. To determine whether L5 has a similar effect, we introduced FLAG-L5 into human osteosarcoma U2OS cells that contain endogenous wild type p53. Interestingly, overexpression of FLAG-L5 also markedly induced p53 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). Correspondingly, the levels of the p53 targets p21cip1 and MDM2 were also induced. Overexpression of GFP-L5 had a similar effect on p53 and p21cip1 induction (Fig. 3C). The induction of p53 by L5 occurred at the posttranscriptional level as the mRNA level of p53 was not affected, whereas p21cip1 induction occurred at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3D). This result suggests that overexpression of L5 stimulates p53 transcriptional activity. To further confirm this stimulatory effect on p53 transcriptional activity, we carried out luciferase assays using a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by a p53RE. Indeed, ectopic expression of L5 markedly stimulated p53RE-driven transcription in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) in p53-proficient U2OS cells, but not in p53-deficient human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. This result indicates that the enhanced luciferase activity is p53-dependent. To test whether induction of p53 and p21cip1 levels by L5 leads to cell growth arrest, we introduced GFP-fused L5 or GFP alone into U2OS and Saos2 cells. Cells were then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis after treatment with the mitotic inhibitor nocodazole (17Boyd M.T. Vlatkovic N. Haines D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31883-31890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). GFP-positive cells were then gated for cell cycle analysis. A representative result in Fig. 3A shows that 26.6% of GFP-L5-expressing U2OS cells were arrested in the G1 phase, whereas only 5.9% of U2OS cells expressing GFP were detected in the G1 phase (Fig. 3, A and B). The G1 arrest induced by L5 was dependent on p53 because no significant change was observed in p53-null Saos2 cells that contained ectopically expressed GFP-L5 (Fig. 3, A and B). Correspondingly, both p53 and p21cip1 protein levels (Fig. 3C) as well as the mRNA level of p21cip1 (Fig. 3D) were induced by GFP-L5, but not GFP, in U2OS cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ectopic expression of L5 induces p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent G1 arrest. Overexpression of L5 Inhibits MDM2-mediated p53 Ubiquitination—To determine whether p53 induction by L5 is caused by inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, we introduced exogenous MDM2, p53, and L5 into p53-deficient human non-small cell carcinoma H1299 cells. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and 6 h after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for ubiquitination and immunoblot assays. As shown in Fig. 4A and by others (18Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 19Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 20Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar), MDM2 ubiquitinated p53 (lane 4). By contrast, expression of L5 (lanes 5 and 6) remarkably inhibited p53 ubiquitination in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was not generated by sample loading, as the levels of all the proteins were approximately equivalent (Fig. 4A, bottom panels). Consistently, expression of L5 also partially rescued MDM2-mediated p53 degradation in the absence of MG132 (Fig. 4B, compare lane 3 with lane 4). These results indicate that L5 can stabilize p53 by alleviating MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Actinomycin D Induces L5 Interaction and Activates p53, Which Is Inhibited by L5 siRNA—Our recent study (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) suggests that L23 may be involved in p53 activation induced by a low dose (5 nm) of Act D. Because 5 nm of Act D has been shown to specifically inhibit RNA polymerase I and thus to lead to perturbation of ribosomal biogenesis and p53 activation (6Ashcroft M. Taya Y. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether L5, like L11 (8Lohrum M.A. Ludwig R.L. Kubbutat M.H. Hanlon M. Vousden K.H. Cancer Cells. 2003; 3: 577-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 9Zhang Y. Wolf G.W. Bhat K. Jin A. Allio T. Burkhart W.A. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8902-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and L23 (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), also plays a role in this ribosomal biogenesis stress-p53 pathway. To this end, siRNA against L5 was introduced into U2OS cells prior to treatment with 5 nm of Act D. As shown in Fig. 5A, similar to the case of L23 (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), siRNA against L5 also drastically inhibited Act D-induced p53 levels (5.5-fold reduction; compare lane 4 to lane 3 of top panel) and activation evidenced by the reduced MDM2 and p21cip1 levels (lane 4 of second and third panels), suggesting that L5 might also be an important regulator of the Act D-p53 pathway. However, unlike in the case of L23, in which L23 reduction by its siRNA drastically induced both p53 and MDM2 (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), ablation of L5 by its siRNA slightly reduced the p53 level in Act D-untreated cells (2.1-fold reduction, compare lane 2 to lane 1 of top panel). This slight reduction of p53 by L5 siRNA does not contradict the result above showing that siRNA against L5 inhibited Act D-induced p53 levels, because the reduction (5.5-fold) of p53 by L5 siRNA in cells treated with Act D was much greater than that in cells without Act D treatment (2.1-fold). Of note, the slight decrease of p53 in L5 siRNA-treated cells was specific to p53; it was caused by global translational inhibition after reduction of L5 by its siRNA. First, the level of another short-living cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27kip1, was not affected by L5 siRNA treatment (Fig. 5A, fourth panel, lanes 2 and 4) compared with scramble RNA-transfected cells (lanes 1 and 3). Second, as shown in Fig. 5B, L5 siRNA treatment did not significantly reduce the overall protein level (compare lane 2 to lane 1) and protein synthesis (compare lane 4 to lane 3) as determined by silver staining and [35S]methionine pulse labeling experiments, respectively. These results indicate that partial reduction of L5 in a short time (slightly more than half-reduction of L5 level in less than 48 h in our assays) may not significantly affect global translation (Fig. 5A, third lower panel). This phenotype is also supported by a recent knockout study, showing that mice heterozygous for the disrupted ribosomal s19 allele displayed normal growth and organ development though homozygous mice were embryonic lethal (21Matsson H. Davey E.J. Draptchinskaia N. Hamaguchi I. Ooka A. Leveen P. Forsberg E. Karlsson S. Dahl N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4032-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the interaction between L5 and MDM2 after Act D treatment in U2OS cells. The cells were treated with or without 5 nm of Act D for 8 h and used for immunoprecipitation with either monoclonal anti-MDM2 4B11 or polyclonal anti-L5 antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with anti-MDM2 2A10 or anti-L5 antibodies. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5C, the interaction between endogenous L5 and MDM2 was observed in cells treated with Act D as detected by co-immunoprecipitation with either anti-L5 or anti-MDM2 antibodies followed by immunoblot with both of the antibodies tj;2(lanes 3–6). The Act D-induced MDM2-L5 interaction was not because of the induced level of MDM2 by Act D. When we treated the cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, to normalize the MDM2 levels between Act D-treated and untreated cells 6 h before harvesting, the enhanced MDM2-L5 interaction was still observed in Act D-treated cells compared with cells without Act D treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that there is an Act D-induced association of L5 and MDM2 in cells, indicating that like L23 and L11 (7Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol.,. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 8Lohrum M.A. Ludwig R.L. Kubbutat M.H. Hanlon M. Vousden K.H."
https://openalex.org/W2113351822,"Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) has been identified and measured in human platelets. Millimolar levels (in terms of Pi residues) of short chain polyP were found. The presence of polyP of ∼70–75 phosphate units was identified by 31P NMR and by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of platelet extracts. An analysis of human platelet dense granules, purified using metrizamide gradient centrifugation, indicated that polyP was preferentially located in these organelles. This was confirmed by visualization of polyP in the dense granules using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and by its release together with pyrophosphate and serotonin upon thrombin stimulation of intact platelets. Dense granules were also shown to contain large amounts of calcium and potassium and both bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase and pyrophosphatase activities. In agreement with these results, when human platelets were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester to measure their intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), they were shown to possess a significant amount of Ca2+ stored in an acidic compartment. This was indicated by the following: 1) the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by nigericin, monensin, or the weak base, NH4Cl, in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2 and 2) the effect of ionomycin, which could not take Ca2+ out of acidic organelles and was more effective after alkalinization of this compartment by the previous addition of nigericin, monensin, or NH4Cl. All of these characteristics of the platelet dense granules, together with their known acidity and high density (both by weight and by electron microscopy), are similar to those of acidocalcisomes (volutin granules, polyP bodies) of bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes. The results suggest that acidocalcisomes have been conserved during evolution from bacteria to humans. Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) has been identified and measured in human platelets.

Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) 1The abbreviations used are: polyP, inorganic polyphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AMDP, aminomethylenediphosphonate.1The abbreviations used are: polyP, inorganic polyphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; AMDP, aminomethylenediphosphonate. is a ubiquitous polymer formed by phosphate (Pi) residues linked by high energy phosphoanhydride bonds. Although the presence of polyP in bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoa has been widely noted, the distribution and abundance of polyP in more complex eukaryotic forms have remained uncertain for many years (1Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The very low levels of polyP in animal cells and subcellular compartments and the lack of sensitive methods have left its metabolic and functional roles entirely obscure (1Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The recent introduction of novel quantitative enzymatic analytical methods (2Kornberg A. Rao N.N. Ault-Riche D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 89-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) has permitted the detection of levels of 20–120 μm (in terms of Pi residues) in chains that are 50–800 residues long in rodent tissues (brain, heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs) and subcellular fractions (nuclei, mitochondria, plasma membrane, and microsomes) (3Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), but no studies have been reported with human tissues. In bacteria (4Seufferheld M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 29971-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as well as in several unicellular eukaryotes, similar to trypanosomatid and apicomplexan parasites (5Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (6Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (7Marchesini N. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), polyP is accumulated in acidic granules known as acidocalcisomes where it can reach millimolar or molar levels. Acidocalcisomes have been shown to possess calcium- and proton-accumulating activities in their limiting membranes, have very high density (both in weight and by electron microscopy), and are also rich in pyrophosphate (PPi), calcium, and other cations (5Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Human platelets possess an organelle, the dense granule, with morphological and biochemical similarities to acidocalcisomes. Platelet dense granules store extremely high concentrations of calcium together with ATP, ADP, serotonin, and PPi (8McNicol A. Israels S.J. Thromb. Res. 1999; 95: 1-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Holmsen and Weiss (9Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1979; 30: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) calculated the intragranular calcium concentration to be 2.2 m. The internal matrix pH of the dense granules is ∼5.4 (10Carty S.E. Johnson R.G. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11244-11250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this acidic pH is maintained by the function of an H+-ATPase, which is different from F1F0- and P-type ATPases (11Dean G.E. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9569-9574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since acridine orange uptake in dense granules was inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (12Turetta L. Bazzan E. Bertagno K. Musacchio E. Deana R. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), which is a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPases (13Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), it was suggested that this proton pump is a V-H+-ATPase. In addition, calcium release from intracellular acidic stores by the K+/H+ ionophore nigericin has been observed in a number of unicellular eukaryotes that possess acidocalcisomes (5Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) as well as from platelets (14Brüne B. Ulrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Tsunoda Y. Matsuno K. Tashiro Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because acidocalcisomes in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes are morphologically very similar to platelet dense granules, we investigated whether these granules have similar characteristics to acidocalcisomes, also known as volutin granules or polyP bodies (5Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the isolation and biochemical characterization of dense granules from human platelets and demonstrate that, as the acidocalcisomes, they are rich in polyP, which is secreted upon thrombin stimulation. In addition, we report experiments using intact fura 2-loaded platelets that demonstrate that a considerable portion of the releasable Ca2+ is located in these organelles. Our results suggest that acidocalcisome-like organelles are the only ones described to date that are present from bacteria to humans. Chemicals—Leupeptin, trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane (E64), N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, ATP, ionophores, metrizamide, reagents for marker enzyme assays, apyrase, anti-human von Willebrand factor IgG fraction antibodies, apyrase, and polyPs were purchased from Sigma. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride and ionomycin (free acid) were from Calbiochem. Pepstatin came from Roche Applied Science. Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent was from Bio-Rad. Escherichia coli strain CA38 pTrcPPX1 was kindly provided by Prof. Arthur Kornberg (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). Fresh human platelets were obtained from the Community Blood Services of Illinois (Urbana, IL). Aminomethylenediphosphonate was synthesized by Michael Martin (Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). All of the other reagents were of analytical grade. Platelet Dense Granule Isolation—Dense granules were isolated using metrizamide gradient centrifugation by a method previously described (16Rendu F. Lebret M. Nurden A.T. Caen J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1982; 52: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A unit of platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged twice at 200 × g for 10 min to eliminate contaminant red blood cells and leukocytes. The supernatant then was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended at 2 × 109 platelet/ml in lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, 0.25 m sucrose, 12 mm sodium citrate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, and 10 μm N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, pH 6.5). Platelets were sonicated twice (5 s at 20% intensity in a Branson sonifier, model 102c), and unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 15 min). Sonication and centrifugation were repeated twice with the pellets resuspended in a similar volume of lysis buffer. The three supernatants were combined and centrifuged for 20 min at 19,000 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended with lysis buffer up to 1.5 ml and mixed with 1.5 ml of metrizamide solution (40% w/v in nanopure water). This mixture was applied at the top of a discontinuous gradient of metrizamide with 3-ml steps of 35, 38, and 40% metrizamide (prepared by dilution of the 40% solution in lysis buffer). The gradient was centrifuged at 100,000 × g using a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 60 min. The dense granule-rich fraction pelleted at the bottom of the tube and was resuspended in lysis buffer. To determine serotonin incorporation into gradient fractions, platelet-rich plasma lacking red blood cells and leukocytes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 μCi/ml 1 μm 5-[2-14C]-hydroxytryptamine binoxalate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and the fractionation procedure was performed as described above. von Willebrand factor levels in the gradient fractions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-human von Willebrand factor IgG fraction antibodies. Gradient fractions were assayed also for succinate-cytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial marker) and acid phosphatase (lysosome marker) (17Fukami M.H. Bauer J.S. Stewart G.J. Salganicoff L. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), short and long chain chain polyP and PPi (18Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), bafilomycin A1(0.5 μm)-sensitive ATPase (V-H+-ATPase), and pyrophosphatase (7Marchesini N. Ruiz F.A. Vieira M. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8146-8153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The construction of normalized density distribution histograms was carried out as described before (19Leighton F. Poole B. Beaufay H. Baudhuin P. Coffey J.W. Fowler S. De Duve C. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 37: 482-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Analysis of PolyP—Urea-polyacrylamide gels were prepared and stained with toluidine blue as previously described (18Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Marker polyPs were obtained by electrophoresis of phosphate glass in 1.5% agarose gels. 4-mm-long gel slices were eluted by centrifugation trough Millipore Ultrafree-MC columns to obtain polyPs of different sizes. The markers were localized by toluidine blue staining, and their size was calculated by calibration with commercial polyPs. Electron Microscopy and X-ray Microanalysis—For imaging whole cells, platelets were washed first in Tris citrate buffer (63 mm Tris, 95 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 12 mm citric acid, pH 6.5) and then with 0.25 m sucrose. Dense granule fractions were washed with 0.25 m sucrose. Samples were placed on a Formvar-coated 200-mesh copper grid, allowed to adhere for 10 min at room temperature, blotted dry, and observed directly with a Hitachi 600 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV (20Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis was done at the Electron Microscopy Center (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, IL). Specimen grids were examined in a Hitachi H-7100FA transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 50 kV. Fine probe sizes were adjusted to cover the dense granules (or a similar area of the background), and x-rays were collected for 100 s by utilizing a thin window (Norvar) detector. Analysis was performed by using a Noran Voyager III analyzer with a standardless analysis identification program. Conventional electron microscopy of the dense granule fraction was done as described previously (20Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L. Lu H.-G. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Platelets (∼108) were washed with New Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.35% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.35). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer, and 45 μl of this suspension was incubated at room temperature with 10 μg of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/ml. After 10 min, the samples were mounted on a slide and observed with an Olympus model BX-60 epifluorescence microscope. An Olympus WU filter (excitation: 380–385 nm; emission: >420) was used. The images were recorded with a charge-coupled device camera (model CH250, Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) and IPLab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA) as described previously (21Lu H.-G. Zhong L. Chang K.-P. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9464-9473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min and 100 μm aspirin, and 40 μg/ml apyrase were added to the supernatant. Platelets were incubated at 37 °C with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 1 h. Labeled platelets were centrifuged at 1,000 × g 10 min and washed in New Tyrode's buffer. Cells then were resuspended in the same buffer at 2 × 108 platelets/ml and kept at 37 °C. For fluorescence measurements, 1.25 × 108 cells/ml (final density) were suspended in a cuvette containing New Tyrode's buffer and 1 mm EGTA. Fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured with 340 and 380 nm excitation in a thermostated Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer at 37 °C with agitation. Calibration was performed as described previously (22Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Perchloric Acid Extracts—For NMR, platelets were washed twice with New Tyrode's buffer and then extracted with ice-cold 0.5 m HClO4 (2 ml/g wet weight cells). After a 30-min incubation on ice, the extracts were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were neutralized by the addition of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3 (18Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Precipitated KClO4 was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was separated, and EDTA was added to a final concentration of 400 μm prior to adjusting to pH 7. All of the extracts contained 10% D2O (v/v) to provide a field-frequency lock. NMR Spectroscopy—Phosphorus NMR spectra were acquired at 303.6 MHz using a Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer equipped with a 17.6-tesla Oxford Instruments magnet. For perchloric acid extracts, 8,192 transients were collected at room temperature using 25 μs (90°) pulse excitation, a 20-kHz spectral width, 32,768 data points, and a 5-s recycle time. Inverse gated proton decoupling was used to remove NOE and J-coupling effects. The chemical shifts of all of the 31P spectra were referenced to 0 ppm using an 85% phosphoric acid external standard (23Van Wazer J.R. Ditchfield R. Burt C.T. Phosphorus NMR in Biology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 1-23Google Scholar). The specific assignments of individual resonances were based on published chemical shifts and 31P-31P scalar couplings (24Moreno B. Urbina J.A. Oldfield E. Bailey B.N. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28356-28362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were processed using the VNMR 6.1B software package (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) running on a Sun Ultra 5 (Sun Microsystems, Santa Clara, CA) work station and included base-line correction, zero-filling, and a 3-Hz exponential line broadening prior to Fourier transformation. Analysis of Platelet-released Material—Platelet-rich plasma lacking red blood cells and leukocytes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 1 μCi/ml 1 μm 5-[2-14C]hydroxytryptamine binoxalate. Platelets were washed and resuspended in New Tyrode's buffer at 108 cell/ml. The platelet suspension was placed in a cuvette with agitation. Thrombin was added at a final concentration of 1.2 units/ml, and aliquots were taken at different times. Samples were directly filtered trough a 0.2-μm filter to separate the secreted material from the suspension. The contents of PPi, short chain polyP, and serotonin in the samples were analyzed as described above. H+ Transport Assays—H+ uptake into platelet dense granules was assayed using acridine orange as described previously (6Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using a standard buffer containing 120 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm K-Hepes, and 50 μm EGTA, pH 7.2. Elemental Analysis and Isolation of Human Platelet Dense Granules—Human platelet dense granules are known to be acidic (10Carty S.E. Johnson R.G. Scarpa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11244-11250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to accumulate calcium (9Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1979; 30: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). They are characterized, as the acidocalcisomes (5Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), by their high electron density. They were first described as electron-opaque organelles in airdried whole mounts by Bull (25Bull B.S. Blood. 1966; 28: 901-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), White (26White J.G. Blood. 1969; 33: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Costa et al. (27Costa J.L. Reese T.S. Murphy D.L. Science. 1974; 183: 537-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Several dense granules with high electron density of varying diameter (average 161 ± 51 nm) were seen when whole human platelets were observed by transmission electron microscopy without fixation and staining (Fig. 1A). 5–20 granules of various shapes and sizes were observed per platelet (n = 20). This finding is in agreement with previous reports of the presence a variable number of dense bodies per platelet ranging from none to >20 (28Costa J.L. Detwiler T.C. Feinman R.D. Murphy D.L. Patlak D.S. Pettigrew K.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 264: 297-306Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). X-ray microanalysis was performed on these granules (Fig. 1B). All of the ten spectra taken from different platelets were qualitatively similar, the phosphorus/calcium ratio being 1.76 as it has been reported previously (29Skaer R.J. Emmines J.P. Peters P.D. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 20: 441-457PubMed Google Scholar). Potassium and oxygen were also detected. Carbon, silicon, and copper arose from the Formvar-coated grids and were also detected in spectra taken from the background. To purify the dense granules and investigate their chemical and enzymatic content, we adapted the purification procedure used by Rendu et al. (16Rendu F. Lebret M. Nurden A.T. Caen J.P. Br. J. Haematol. 1982; 52: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An examination of the densest fraction 12 (see below) by transmission electron microscopy without fixation and staining showed round electron-dense granules of variable size up to 200 nm in diameter (Fig. 2A). When submitted to the electron beam, changes in their internal structure led to the appearance of a spongelike structure (Fig. 2A, inset), which has been described before in the acidocalcisomes of Trypanosoma cruzi (30Lu H.-G. Zhong L. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2309-2323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Trypanosoma brucei (31Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C. reinhardtii (6Ruiz F.A. Marchesini N. Seufferheld M. Govindjee Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (4Seufferheld M. Vieira M.C.F. Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29971-29978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An examination of the fraction using conventional transmission electron microscopy with fixation, dehydration, and staining procedures showed membrane-bound organelles of similar size that appeared empty (Fig. 2B). Marker enzymes were used to characterize the different fractions (Fig. 3). Serotonin incorporation (26White J.G. Blood. 1969; 33: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a marker for dense granules. Its yield in the dense granule fraction (fraction 12) was 25%, whereas the yield of protein in the same fraction was only 6%, a 4.2-fold purification. Although the incorporation of serotonin was greater in fraction 3, which consisted of whole platelets and large fragments, the purest dense granule fraction was the densest fraction (fraction 12). Mitochondria (marked by succinate cytochrome c reductase), lysosomes (marked by acid phosphatase), and α-granules (marked by the presence of von Willebrand factor) were not enriched in the densest fraction. The dense granule fraction contained ∼20% total PPi and short chain polyP (see below) (Fig. 3). PolyP in Human Platelets—Platelet extracts yielded levels of polyP of 0.74 ± 0.08 nmol/108 platelets (n = 8) and no detectable long chain polyP (data not shown). If we assume that the platelet volume is 6.8 mm3 (9Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1979; 30: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), the concentration of polyP in platelets is around 1.1 mm. Thus, platelet polyP concentration is 10–20 times higher than that measured in rodent tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, lung, and liver (3Kumble K.D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5818-5822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to other cell types studied, all of the polyP detected was <100 residues long. PolyP levels were in the same order of magnitude as the PPi (0.92 ± 0.19 nmol/108 platelets; n = 8) measured by its hydrolysis with yeast pyrophosphatase. An excess of pyrophosphatase in our assay degraded <2% polyP, demonstrating the reliability of the obtained values for the different populations of phosphate polymers. We can estimate the concentration of polyP in the dense granule from the total amount of polyP in the whole platelet (see above). If we assume that the polyP in the dense granule is ∼60% of the total (as it occurs with calcium, ADP, ATP, and PPi), the volume of each granule is 0.1% platelet volume (9Holmsen H. Weiss H.J. Annu. Rev. Med. 1979; 30: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and there is an average of 5 dense granules/platelet (8McNicol A. Israels S.J. Thromb. Res. 1999; 95: 1-18Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 28Costa J.L. Detwiler T.C. Feinman R.D. Murphy D.L. Patlak D.S. Pettigrew K.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 264: 297-306Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the intragranular concentration of polyP is ∼130 mm. Further Evidence for the Localization of PolyP in the Dense Granules—We also investigated the location of polyP using DAPI (Fig. 4). DAPI has been shown to shift its emission fluorescence to a maximum wavelength of 525 nm in the presence of polyP, this change being specific for polyP and not produced by PPi or other anions (18Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26114-26121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Allan R.A. Miller J.J. Can. J. Microbiol. 1980; 26: 912-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Human platelets incubated in solutions of DAPI (0.2 mg/ml) were mounted on slides and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. We detected the staining of numerous intracellular vacuoles. No staining was detected when DAPI was omitted (data not shown). Identification of PolyP by 31P NMR and Urea-PAGE Analysis—Fig. 5 shows the 303.6-MHz (1H decoupled) 31P NMR spectra of perchloric acid extracts of human platelets. Resonance assignments for these spectra are given in Table I. The predominant peak in the spectrum is inorganic phosphate (peak A). The region between –6 and –8 ppm is shown in left inset magnified 2.5× with respect to the overall spectra and contains peaks for the terminal phosphates of adenosine diphosphate (peak B) and triphosphate (peak C) in addition to peaks for the terminal phosphates of polyPs (peak D) and a large peak for PPi (peak E). The region from –10 to –12 ppm contains peaks for the α-phosphates of adenosine diphosphate (F) and triphosphate (G). The region from –20 to –23 ppm is shown in the right inset magnified 2.5× with respect to the overall spectra and contains peaks for the central phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (peak H) and the γ-phosphates (Central P) of polyPs (peak I).Table I31P NMR resonance assignments for perchloric acid extracts of human plateletsPeakAssignmentChemical shiftppmAInorganic phosphate1.22Bγ-P of ATP-7.06Cβ-P ADP-7.23Dα-P of polyphosphates-7.52EPyrophosphate-7.76Fα-P of ADP-10.42Gα-P of ATP-10.76Hβ-P of ATP-20.38ICentral P of polyphosphates-22.02 Open table in a new tab PolyPs extracted from human platelets were electrophoresed by 6% urea-PAGE to determine their size distribution (Fig. 6). Only one size class of polyP was detected in the three samples analyzed, the short chain polyP of ∼70–75 residues. PolyP Release after Stimulation of Platelets with Thrombin— Because 80% total PPi is secreted by platelets treated with thrombin with a time course similar to the secretion of ATP, ADP, and serotonin from the platelet dense granules (33Fukami M.H. Dangelmaier C.A. Bauer J.S. Holmsen H. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we investigated whether thrombin had a similar effect on the release of polyP. Fig. 7 shows that this was the case, confirming that polyP is in the same compartment containing PPi and serotonin. Intracellular Ca2+ Concentration [Ca2+]i in Human Platelets: Effect of Thapsigargin and Nigericin—The concentration of cytosolic calcium in human platelets was 22 ± 2.8 nm (n = 6) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA added).

https://openalex.org/W2144517709,"Living in large, stable social groups is often considered to favour the evolution of enhanced cognitive abilities, such as recognizing group members, tracking their social status and inferring relationships among them1,2,3,4. An individual's place in the social order can be learned through direct interactions with others, but conflicts can be time-consuming and even injurious. Because the number of possible pairwise interactions increases rapidly with group size, members of large social groups will benefit if they can make judgments about relationships on the basis of indirect evidence5. Transitive reasoning should therefore be particularly important for social individuals, allowing assessment of relationships from observations of interactions among others. Although a variety of studies have suggested that transitive inference may be used in social settings6,7,8,9,10, the phenomenon has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions in animals. Here we show that highly social pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) draw sophisticated inferences about their own dominance status relative to that of strangers that they have observed interacting with known individuals. These results directly demonstrate that animals use transitive inference in social settings and imply that such cognitive capabilities are widespread among social species."

https://openalex.org/W2111048324,"The interferon regulatory factors (IRF) are transcriptional mediators of cellular response to viral invasion that play a critical role in the innate antiviral defense. Two of these factors, IRF-5 and IRF-7, play a critical role in the induction of interferon (IFNA) genes in infected cells; they are expressed constitutively in monocytes, B cells, and precursors of dendritic cells (pDC2) that are high producers of interferon α, and their expression can be further stimulated by type I interferon. The goal of the present study was to identify and analyze expression of cellular genes that are modulated by IRF-5 and IRF-7 during the innate response to viral infection. The transcription profiles of infected BJAB cells overexpressing IRF-5 or IRF-7 were determined by using oligonucleotide arrays with probe sets representing about 6800 human genes. This analysis shows that IRF-5 and IRF-7 activate a broad profile of heterologous genes encoding not only antiviral, inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic proteins but also proteins of other functional categories. The number of IRF-5- and IRF-7-modulated genes was significantly higher in infected than in uninfected cells, and the transcription signature was predominantly positive. Although IRF-5 and IRF-7 stimulated a large number of common genes, a distinct functional profile was associated with each of these IRFs. The noted difference was a broad antiviral and early inflammatory transcriptional profile in infected BJAB/IRF-5 cells, whereas the IRF-7-induced transcripts were enriched for the group of mitochondrial genes and genes affecting the DNA structure. Taken together, these data indicate that IRF-5 and IRF-7 act primarily as transcriptional activators and that IRF-5-and IRF-7-induced innate antiviral response results in a broad alteration of the transcriptional profile of cellular genes.

Taken together, these data indicate that IRF-5 and IRF-7 act primarily as transcriptional activators and that IRF-5-and IRF-7-induced innate antiviral response results in a broad alteration of the transcriptional profile of cellular genes. The rapid response to infection is essential for host defense. A regulatory network in which a set of transcription factors stimulates expression of the diverse genes encoding for early inflammatory proteins mediates this response. The functional diversity of these factors is dependent on their cell-specific expression, post-translational modifications, and interacting cross-talk. Two families of transcription factors have been shown to play a critical role in the innate response to infection. The first is the NF-κB family of factors that are activated by viral infection as well as by binding of bacterial envelopes and double-stranded nucleic acids to Toll-like receptors (TLR). 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptors; IRF, interferon regulatory factors; IFN, interferon; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; TNF, the tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PCBP, poly(C)-binding proteins; CBP, CREB-binding protein; OAS, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase; E2, ubiquitin carrier ligase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; PKR, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptors; IRF, interferon regulatory factors; IFN, interferon; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; TNF, the tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, TNF receptor; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PCBP, poly(C)-binding proteins; CBP, CREB-binding protein; OAS, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase; E2, ubiquitin carrier ligase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; TBP, TATA box-binding protein; PKR, double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase. The second is the family of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF), particularly IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7, that are activated by virus infection and/or ligands binding to TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 (1Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). 2A. Schoenemeyer, B. J.

A. Fitzgerald, and D. T. Golenbock, unpublished results. These factors play a critical role in the induction of antiviral proteins, type I IFNs, as well as some chemokines. The IRF are transcription mediators of virus and IFN-induced signaling pathways and have been shown to play a critical role in antiviral defense, immune response, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis. To date, nine cellular IRF genes (IRF-1, IRF-2, IRF-3, IRF-4/Pip/ICSAT, IRF-5, IRF-6, IRF-7, ICSBP/IRF-8, and ISGF3γ/p48/IRF-9), as well as virus-encoded analogues of cellular IRF have been identified (2Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Nguyen H. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These factors can function as transcriptional activators (e.g. IRF-1, IRF-3, and IRF-9), repressors (e.g. IRF-8), or both (e.g. IRF-2, IRF-4, IRF-5, and IRF-7). They all share significant homology in the N-terminal 115 amino acids, which comprises the DNA-binding domain, characterized by five tryptophan repeats. Three of these repeats contact DNA with specific recognition of the GAAA and AANNNGAA sequences (4Escalante C.R. Yie J. Thanos D. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). However, the unique function of a particular IRF is accounted for by a cell type-specific expression, its intrinsic transactivation potential, and an ability to interact with other members of the IRF family or other transcription factors and cofactors (5Taniguchi T. Ogasawara K. Takaoka A. Tanaka N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 623-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). Three IRF (IRF-3, IRF-5, and IRF-7) function as direct transducers of virus-mediated signaling and play a crucial role in the expression of type I IFN genes and some chemokines, including RANTES (6Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Pitha P.M. Virology. 2001; 280: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell.

Although IRF-3 is constitutively expressed in all cell types (9Au W.-C. Moore P.A. Lowther W. Juang Y.-T. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11657-11661Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), expression of IRF-7 and IRF-5 can be detected predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin and can be further stimulated by type I IFN (10Au W.C.

In splenic B cells, monocytes, and particularly in precursor dendritic cells (pDC2) that are high producers of IFNα, both IRF-5 and IRF-7 are expressed constitutively (12Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J.

In uninfected cells, IRF-3 and IRF-7 reside predominantly in the cytoplasm, but upon virus-induced phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine residues, mediated by IKKϵ and TBK1 (13Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref Scopus (2003) Google Scholar, 14Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N.

Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). These two factors were identified as components of the transcriptional complex enhanceosome, binding to the promoters of IFNA1 and IFNB genes in infected cells (16Au W.C. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although IRF-5 is also activated by viral infection, it shows several distinct features from IRF-3 and IRF-7 (7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Barnes B.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16630-16641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The IRF-5 polypeptide contains two nuclear localization signals that are not present in IRF-3 or IRF-7, and low levels of nuclear IRF-5 can be detected in uninfected cells (7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Although viral infection results in the further accumulation of nuclear IRF-5, activation of IRF-5 appears to be virus-specific, and thus, it can be phosphorylated in NDV-infected but not in Sendai virus-infected cells (7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although IRF-3 expression is sufficient for the induction of IFNB (19Juang Y.

Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 959-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), IRF-5 and IRF-7 have critical roles in the induction of IFNA genes in human cells (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6313-6320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of IRF-5 or IRF-7 expression in human cells, which under normal conditions express only the IFNB gene, results in the virus-mediated induction of IFNA genes (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 21Yeow W.S. Au W.C. Juang Y.T. Fields C.D. Dent C.L. Gewert D.R. Pitha P.M. J.

These results demonstrate both the essential and distinct roles of IRF-5 and IRF-7, which together ensure the transcriptional regulation of diverse IFNA genes during the antiviral response. In addition to their role in innate immunity, IRF-7 and IRF-5 have distinct roles in the differentiation of lymphoid cells and apoptosis. IRF-7 was found to be a macrophage differentiation factor (22Lu R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45491-45496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and its expression is silenced by CpG methylation in some tumor cell lines (23Lu R. Au W.C. Yeow W.S. Hageman N. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31805-31812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). On the other hand, IRF-5 is transcriptionally activated by the tumor suppressor p53 (24Mori T. Anazawa Y. Iiizumi M. Fukuda S. Nakamura Y. Arakawa H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2914-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); it induces p21WAF1/CIP1 and arrests cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (25Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of IRF-5 induces expression of several pro-apoptotic genes and apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. Most interestingly, a high percentage of primary lymphocytic malignancies shows a lack of IRF-5 expression (25Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal localizations of the IRF-5 and IRF-7 genes also suggest their growth regulatory functions. IRF-7 is localized on chromosome 11p15.5 (22Lu R. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45491-45496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and IRF-5 is on chromosome 7q32 (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Both of these regions contain a number of imprinted genes. These findings indicate that both of these IRF have a distinct role in the physiology of lymphoid cells and that deregulation of their inherent functions may lead to tumorigenesis. Although both IRF-5 and IRF-7 can support virus-mediated induction of IFNA gene expression, the observation that IRF-5 and IRF-7 activate expression of different IFNA subtypes (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and that their functions in uninfected cells appear distinct, suggests that IRF-5 and IRF-7 are not redundant in their roles. The goal of the present study was therefore to identify and analyze cellular genes involved with the antiviral and anti-inflammatory host response, expression of which is modulated by IRF-5 or IRF-7. The data reveal that overexpression of IRF-5 or IRF-7 in B cells modulates the expression of a large group of distinct and overlapping genes in both infected and uninfected cells. Both these factors induced a large group of genes involved in transcriptional activation and signaling. However, although the signature of IRF-5 in infected cells was a strong immune response and induction of adhesion genes, IRF-7 selectively up-regulated the expression of mitochondrial genes and genes involved in the DNA repair and structure. Cell Culture and Virus—Parental BJAB cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. BJAB cells constitutively expressing IRF-5 or IRF-7 were generated by transfection of the N-terminal FLAG-tagged IRF-5, IRF-7, or empty vector expressing plasmid in which the IRF cDNAs were under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, as described previously (11Barnes B.J.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was purchased from the ATCC (VR-699). Cells were infected with NDV at a multiplicity of infection of 2.0 for 6 h. Preparation of cRNA and Gene Chip Hybridization—Total RNA was isolated from infected and uninfected BJAB vector control cells and BJAB/IRF-5 and BJAB/IRF-7 cells by the CsCl method and subsequently used to generate labeled cRNA probes. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the HuGeneU95Av2 arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 5 μg of the RNA was converted into double-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription using a cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript Choice, Invitrogen). After second strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitro transcription reaction supplemented with biotin-11-CTP and biotin-16-UTP (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY). The labeled cRNA was purified by using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fifteen micrograms of each cRNA sample was fragmented by mild alkaline treatment and then hybridized to human U95A oligonucleotide probe array complementary to 6800 genes (Affymetrix). The arrays were then washed with 6× SSPE and 0.5× SSPE, stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes), washed again, and read by using a confocal microscope scanner with the 560-nm long pass filter (Amersham Biosciences; Affymetrix). GeneChip 3.0 software was used to perform data analysis. This software includes algorithms that determine whether a gene is absent or present and whether the expression level of a gene in an experimental sample is significantly increased or decreased relative to a control sample. To assess differences in gene expression, we selected genes that had a greater than 2-fold change and a p value of less than 0.01. The p values were calculated by using two-sample t test on log-transformed data. The microarray data are available on the following web site: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo using the accession numbers GPL1332, GPL1333, GPL1334, and GPL1335. RT-PCR—Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from total RNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the conditions under which cDNAs were amplified in the linear region of the PCR curve. The reaction mixture was composed of 10 ng of cDNA template; 25 pmol of primers; 25 nmol of each dNTP; 0.2 units Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen); 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer in a final volume of 25 μl. Primers used for IRF-5, IRF-7, and β-actin amplification have been described previously (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

The membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer containing 5% milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8; 50 mm NaCl. Subsequent incubation was performed for 1 h with a M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The membranes were subsequently incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and immunodetection was realized by ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) followed by autoradiography on hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular Localization of GFP-IRF-5 or GFP-IRF-7 Proteins—BJAB cells (2 × 106) were transfected with GFP-IRF-5 (10 μg) (7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) or GFP-IRF-7 (10 μg) (10Au W.C. Moore P.A. LaFleur D.W. Tombal B. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) using the Amaxa nucleofector reagent and electroporation, as described by the manufacturer. Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were either left uninfected or infected with NDV for 3 or 6 h. Cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope at ×40 magnification. Characterization of BJAB Cells Overexpressing IRF-5 and IRF-7—In order to identify genes modulated by IRF-5 or IRF-7 in uninfected and virus-infected cells, we have utilized the previously generated BJAB/IRF-5 and BJAB/IRF-7 overexpressing cell lines (25Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E. Frisancho J.A. Pitha P.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6424-6431PubMed Google Scholar). The BJAB cell lines were selected for this analysis because both of these factors are constitutively expressed in splenic primary B cells,2 and we wished to analyze IRF-induced genes in a cell type that expresses these IRF in vivo. We have shown previously that type I IFN can stimulate transcription of both IRF-5 and IRF-7. As shown in Fig. 1A, the relative levels of IRF-5 and IRF-7 transcripts in BJAB cells are very low, but they increase in IFNα-stimulated cells indicating that the type I IFN signaling pathway is operative in these cells. We and others have shown that both IRF-3 and IRF-7 are activated by phosphorylation in infected cells which results in nuclear accumulation of these factors. The nuclear localization of IRF-5 and IRF-7 is essential for their transcriptional activity. We therefore examined whether NDV infection of BJAB cells induces nuclear translocation of the ectopic GFP-labeled IRF-5 or IRF-7. The results in Fig. 1B show that while in the uninfected transfected BJAB cells, GFP-IRF-7 resides primarily in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus; as early as 3 h post-infection, GFP-IRF-7 localizes in the nucleus and can also be observed in the nucleus 6 h post-infection. It should be kept in mind that BJAB cells are nonadherent cells, and therefore a clear distinction between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is not as well defined as in adherent cells. Similar redistribution can also be seen for GFP-IRF-5, although as we have shown previously (11Barnes B.J. Moore P.A. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23382-23390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), low levels of IRF-5 are also present in the nucleus of uninfected cells (7Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Field A.E. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a clear change in cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation is observed. These data indicate that NDV induces activation of IRF-5 and IRF-7 and their translocation to the nucleus of BJAB cells. The second reason for selection of BJAB cells for this study was that neither IRF-5 nor IRF-7 proteins could be detected in unstimulated BJAB cells (data not shown), whereas the expression of IRF-5 and IRF-7 proteins encoded by the ectopic plasmids was high. As shown in Fig. 2A, the relative levels of IRF-7 transcripts were significantly lower in BJAB cells (lanes 1 and 3) than in BJAB/IRF-7-expressing cells (lanes 2 and 4), and these levels were unaffected by virus infection (lanes 6 and 8). In addition, the IRF-7 protein was detected in lysates of BJAB/IRF-7 cells but not in BJAB parental cells (data not shown). Similarly, IRF-5 transcripts were detected only in lysates of uninfected (lanes 2 and 4) and infected (lanes 6 and 8) BJAB/IRF-5 cells and not in the infected (lanes 5 and 7) and uninfected (lanes 1 and 3) BJAB cells. In addition, the ectopic IRF-5 protein was also detected by immunoblot analysis in BJAB/IRF-5 cells. Thus, these cell lines allow us to analyze and compare global gene expression in the same cell type that differs only in the level of expression of IRF-5 or IRF-7. Although the levels of IRF-5 and IRF-7 in BJAB/IRF-5 and IRF-7 cells are high, we do believe that these are physiologically relevant because the levels of IRF-5 and IRF-7 differ in many lymphoid cells, and we have shown recently (12Izaguirre A. Barnes B.J. Amrute S. Yeow W.S. Megjugorac N. Dai J. Feng D. Chung E. Pitha P.M. Fitzgerald-Bocarsly P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) that primary pDC2 cells express high levels of the IRF-7 protein constitutively. Gene Expression Profile of BJAB Cells Overexpressing IRF-7—By using microarray analysis, gene expression signatures unique to IRF-7 were determined by comparison of gene expression in infected and uninfected BJAB/vector and BJAB/IRF-7-expressing cells. Because IRF-7 was shown to play a critical role in the induction of an antiviral immune response, we have examined the effects of IRF-7 overexpression on the virus-stimulated gene profile in uninfected and NDV-infected cells. Data were generated from two independent experiments, in which two independent RNA isolations from the same cell lines were analyzed. RNAs isolated from infected and uninfected cells were hybridized to U95A Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays containing 6,800 human genes, and the data were analyzed with GeneChip 3 software. The pattern of expression was remarkably similar between the two independent analyses, and genes modified by IRF-7 by 2-fold or greater, with a p value < 0.01, were selected for further analysis. IRF-7 modulated the expression of a large number of cellular genes (Table II). This number was significantly enhanced in cells following NDV infection compared with uninfected cells (693 and 232 genes, respectively). The large majority of regulated genes were positively influenced by IRF-7 (630 up-regulated genes), and only 63 genes were down-regulated. A large number (58%) of genes were commonly up-regulated by IRF-7 and IRF-5 in infected cells (Table II), whereas only 15% of the genes were commonly up-regulated by both of these factors in uninfected cells. The up-regulated genes were then grouped into functional families, and the groups were assigned by using NCBI Unigene and locus link or gene cards (bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/cards).Table IINumber of genes modified by IRF-5 and IRF-7 in BJAB cellsModificationIRF5IRF7Common genesUp-regulatedInfected568630371Uninfected8821633Down-regulatedInfected896326Uninfected67163 Open table in a new tab The functional categories that contained at least five genes overexpressed in BJAB/IRF-7 cells at least by 2.5-fold compared with BJAB vector control cells are summarized in Table III. In all categories, the impact of IRF-7 was greater in NDV-infected than uninfected cells. The resulting increase in the transactivation ability of IRF-7 in infected cells is most likely because of the activation of the IRF-7 polypeptide by phosphorylation and the consequent nuclear accumulation upon viral infection (Fig. 1B) (6Au W.C.

In fact, sustained activation of β-catenin by expression of Wnt1 or Wnt 10b in preadipocytes blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting PPARγ-associated gene expression. In this report, we investigated the mechanisms regulating the balance between β-catenin and PPARγ signaling that determines whether mouse fibroblasts differentiate into adipocytes. Specifically, we show that activation of PPARγ by exposure of Swiss mouse fibroblasts to troglitazone stimulates the degradation of β-catenin, which depends on glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β activity. Mutation of serine 37 (a target of GSK3β) to an alanine renders β-catenin resistant to the degradatory action of PPARγ. Ectopic expression of the GSK3β phosphorylation-defective S37A-β-catenin in Swiss mouse fibroblasts expressing PPARγ stimulates the canonical Wnt signaling pathway without blocking their troglitazone-dependent differentiation into lipid-laden cells. Analysis of protein expression in these cells, however, shows that S37A-β-catenin inhibits a select set of adipogenic genes because adiponectin expression is completely blocked, but FABP4/aP2 expression is unaffected. Furthermore, the mutant β-catenin appears to have no affect on the ability of PPARγ to bind to or transactivate a PPAR response element. The S37A-β-catenin-associated inhibition of adiponectin expression coincides with an extensive decrease in the abundance of C/EBPα in the nuclei of the differentiated mouse fibroblasts. Taken together, these data suggest that GSKβ is a key regulator of the balance between β-catenin and PPARγ activity and that activation of canonical Wnt signaling downstream of PPARγ blocks expression of a select subset of adipogenic genes.

The canonical Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating the fate of many different cell types during early development (1Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). A major component of the Wnt pathway is the versatile protein, β-catenin, which fulfills several functions during the growth and differentiation of various cells (2Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). β-Catenin is a component of cell-cell adherans junctions particularly in epithelial cells but is also involved in transducing the Wnt signal by coactivating Lef/Tcf transcription factors (3Ben-Ze'ev A.

Recent studies suggest that β-catenin might also act as a coactivator of other transcription factors including members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (5Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P.

The ability of cytoplasmic β-catenin to activate Wnt or other signaling pathways depends on its ability to escape proteasomal degradation and relocate to the nucleus. Degradation of β-catenin occurs in the absence of Wnt signaling in a cytoplasmic compartment containing the scaffold protein, Axin, the serine/threonine kinase GSK3β, 1The abbreviations used are: GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; HA, hemagglutinin; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. and adenomatous polyposis coli protein (10Peifer M.

The differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes involves the stimulation of a cascade of transcriptional events that include expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, which together induce expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. These factors cooperate to regulate expression of the entire adipogenic program leading to the formation of the mature fat cell (26Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ is considered a principal component of this cascade because adipogenesis does not occur in PPARγ-deficient mesenchymal stem cells in vivo or in vitro (27Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37731-37734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 31Walczak R. Tontonoz P. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, studies have suggested that PPARγ may act as a suppressor of growth-related events to facilitate terminal differentiation into adipocytes (32Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In this regard, we recently demonstrated that the suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling during adipogenesis involves a PPARγ-associated targeting of β-catenin for degradation in the proteasome (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, forced overexpression of Wnt or a GSK3β phosphorylation-defective mutant of β-catenin in preadipocytes blocks adipogenesis in part by inhibiting PPARγ expression (23Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 24Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L. Hemati N.

It appears, therefore, that there is a balance between β-catenin and PPARγ signaling during adipogenesis. In this study, our goal was to define the mechanisms regulating the balance between β-catenin and PPARγ signaling during the differentiation of mouse fibroblasts into adipocytes. We demonstrate that activation of PPARγ in mouse fibroblasts stimulates the degradation of phosphorylated β-catenin, whereas a GSK3β phosphorylation-defective β-catenin in which serine 37 has been modified to alanine (S37A) is resistant to the action of PPARγ. Interestingly, expression of the stable oncogenic S37A form of β-catenin in fibroblasts expressing PPARγ inhibits a select subset of adipogenic genes because it blocks adiponectin expression without a significant affect on aP2 expression. This selective effect of β-catenin appears to result from the inhibition of the PPARγ-associated induction of C/EBPα expression without blocking overall PPARγ activity. Antibodies—Anti-C/EBPα, anti-C/EBPβ, anti-PPARγ, anti-actin and anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Tcf4 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), whereas anti-β-catenin and anti-cyclin D1 were from BD Biosciences Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-Acrp30/adiponectin was purchased from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Anti-aP2 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. David Bernlohr (University of Minnesota, MN), and anti-perilipin antibody was a gift of Dr. Andy Greenberg (New England Medical Center, Tufts University, Boston, MA). Plasmids and Stable Cell Lines—The pRevTRE-HA-WT-β-catenin and pRevTRE-HA-S37A-β-catenin vectors were generated by subcloning a BamHI DNA coding fragment of pcDNA3-WT β-catenin and pcDNA3-S37A-β-catenin (34Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), respectively, into the BamHI site of pRevTRE retroviral expression vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The Swiss-Pγ cell line was generated by infecting Swiss mouse fibroblasts constitutively expressing the tetracycline activator protein (Swiss TET-off cells; Clontech) with the pBabe-PPARγ retrovirus (puromycin-resistant). Swiss-Pγ/WT β-catenin and Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cell lines were obtained by infecting Swiss-Pγ cells with pRevTRE-HA-WT β-catenin and pRevTRE-HA-S37A-β-catenin (hygromycin-resistant) retroviruses, respectively, following standard procedures as outlined previously (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm d-glucose and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 μg/ml G418 (for Swiss Tet-Off cell line), plus 1 μg/ml puromycin (for Swiss-Pγ cell line), and 50 μg/ml hygromycin, with 2 μg/ml tetracycline (for Swiss-Pγ/WT β-catenin and Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cell lines). The differentiation of Swiss-Pγ cells was induced by growing cells in p100 dishes until confluent and then exposing them to 5 μm troglitazone. To induce expression of the ectopic β-catenin, Swiss-Pγ/WT β-catenin and/or Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cells were cultured without tetracycline for 3 days and then treated with or without 5 μm troglitazone to activate the adipogenic program. Western Blot Analysis of Proteins—Equal amounts of protein extracted from either the total cell layer or from the nucleus were fractionated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following transfer, the membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with the antibodies specified above. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an ECL substrate kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for detection of specific proteins. When the same membrane was used for sequential antibody detection, the membrane was stripped with 15% H2O2 at room temperature for 30 min. Analysis of RNA—Total cellular RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equivalent amounts of total RNA were assayed for presence of ectopic and endogenous β-catenin mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Primer sequences used for amplification were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) to be specific for HA-tagged β-catenin mRNA (5′-GCC AGG ATG ATC CTA GCT AT-3′ and 5′-GTA GTC GGG GAC GTC GTA AG-3′) or for endogenous β-catenin mRNA (5′-ACA GAA AAG CTG CTG TCA GC-3′ and 5′-AT GTC ATT GCA TAC TGC CCG-3′). The PCRs were performed in the linear range of cycle number for each set of primers, and the corresponding products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was performed as described previously (35Liu J. Beller D.I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the transcription factor response elements (Tcf, 5′-GGC TTT GAT CTT TGC-3′; aP2, ARE7/DR-1 5′-GTC TTA CTG GAT CAG AGT TCA-3′; and C/EBP, 5′-TTT CA GTG TTG CAA TTG AG-3′) were labeled with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The binding reaction mixture contained 10,000 cpm radiolabeled oligonucleotide, 3 μg of nuclear protein (except for Tcf probe 5 μg of protein was used), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 10% glycerol in a final volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and the complexes were separated by PAGE (nondenaturing gel, 6% polyacrylamide in 1× Tris-glycine-EDTA, pH 8.3) at 4 °C for 1.5 h at 300 V. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. For the competition analyses, a 100-fold molar excess of competitor oligonucleotide was incubated with the nuclear extracts (30 min at room temperature) before the addition of the labeled probe. For the supershift assays, 2 μg of the appropriate antibody was added to the reaction mixtures (30 min at room temperature) before addition of the labeled probe. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—The cells were seeded in six-well plates in triplicate for 24 h before transfection. 200 ng of TOPFLASH (firefly reporter) or FOPFLASH (firefly reporter) or 3XARE7/DR1 (firefly reporter) plasmids plus 10 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL_SV40, was transfected into each well using FuGENE 6 (DNA: FuGENE 6 = 1:6). Forty-eight hours later, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 500 μl of passive lysis buffer. Luciferase/Renilla assays were then performed using the DLRII kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Luminoskan Ascent luminometer (Thermo Labsystems, Franklin, MA). The average ratio (from three wells) of luciferase activity (relative light units) to Renilla activity was calculated. The same experiment was repeated at least three times. The final values/standard deviation was calculated based on all repeats. Oil Red O Staining—The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate, and at the specified stage of differentiation they were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 27.5% formaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed with distilled water, stained with 0.3% Oil Red O (Sigma) for 60–70 min, and then rinsed with distilled water prior to photography using a phase contrast microscope. PPARγ Induces a Decrease in β-Catenin Expression during Adipogenesis in Swiss Mouse Fibroblasts—Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of PPARγ induces the down-regulation of β-catenin during the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the mechanisms regulating this process, we constitutively expressed PPARγ in Swiss fibroblasts using a retroviral infection vector, pBabe-PPARγ, which gave rise to a population of cells (Swiss-Pγ cells) with adipogenic potential (see below). To show that the down-regulation of β-catenin responded to changes in PPARγ activity, Swiss-Pγ cells were exposed to troglitazone (a potent PPARγ ligand) for 5 days, and total cellular proteins were harvested at daily intervals for analysis of β-catenin abundance as well as PPARγ activity. The latter was assessed by measuring the expression of FABP4/aP2, a well characterized target of PPARγ. Fig. 1 demonstrates that activation of PPARγ within the Swiss fibroblasts leads to increased expression of aP2 and a dramatic down-regulation of total β-catenin expression as observed previously in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Treatment of the Swiss-Pγ cells with troglitazone also results in a decrease in the abundance of PPARγ, but the rate of decay of β-catenin is significantly faster than that of PPARγ. Exposure of Swiss fibroblasts, which do not express PPARγ, to troglitazone for 5 days (Fig. 1, lane 6) shows a negligible decrease in β-catenin, confirming that the down-regulation of β-catenin is dependent on PPARγ and not some nonspecific effect of the PPARγ ligand. The PPARγ-associated Decrease in β-Catenin Expression Requires GSK3 Activity—Our earlier studies suggested that the PPARγ-associated down-regulation of β-catenin requires a functional proteasome (25Moldes M. Zuo Y. Morrison R.F. Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mechanisms responsible for this effect might involve phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β and/or casein kinase I. Other investigators have suggested that the regulated degradation of β-catenin by the tumor suppressor p53 involve mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of GSK3β activity (36Sadot E. Geiger B. Oren M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6768-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Levina E. Oren M. Ben-Ze'ev A.

Cell. 2001; 7: 915-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a role for GSK3β in the PPARγ-mediated down-regulation of β-catenin, we conditionally overexpressed an HA-tagged wild type β-catenin using the pRevTRE expression system in Swiss-Pγ cells giving rise to a cell line referred to as Swiss-Pγ/WT-β-catenin cells. These cells were cultured for several days in the absence of tetracycline to induce expression of the HA-β-catenin, during which time the fibroblasts reached confluence. At this stage, the cells were exposed to troglitazone in the presence of LiCl or NaCl for 48 h, and the total cellular proteins were harvested for Western blot analysis of HA-β-catenin. Fig. 2A shows an extensive down-regulation of HA-tagged β-catenin in response to troglitazone (compare lanes 2 and 1). Exposure of the cells to LiCl, which inhibits GSK3 activity, prevents the decrease in β-catenin expression in response to activation of PPARγ (compare lanes 2 and 4). To confirm a role for GSK3β in regulating the PPARγ-mediated decrease in β-catenin expression, we also expressed a mutant form of the protein in which serine 37 has been modified to alanine (Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cells). This mutation renders β-catenin resistant to the GSK3β-associated targeting to the proteasome (34Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2B, Swiss-Pγ/WT-β-catenin and Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for several days until confluent. The cells were then exposed to increasing concentrations of troglitazone for 2 days, and the total cellular extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis of HA-tagged β-catenin. The data show the expected down-regulation of wild type (WT) β-catenin in response to activation of PPARγ by increasing doses of troglitazone. In contrast, the mutant S37A protein appears to be completely resistant to the action of PPARγ because its abundance remains essentially constant at all concentrations of the ligand. PPARγ Enhances the Degradation of β-Catenin—The down-regulation of the wild type β-catenin by PPARγ could be due to an increase in degradation or a decrease in synthesis. To investigate whether PPARγ enhances the turnover of β-catenin, Swiss-Pγ/WT-β-catenin and Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cells were cultured in the absence of tetracycline to induce expression of the ectopic β-catenin, and the cells were treated with or without troglitazone for 16 h at which time cycloheximide was added to the culture medium to block protein synthesis. The Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from cells treated with troglitazone shows a rapid decay of the wild type β-catenin during the 8-h exposure to cycloheximide, whereas the mutant S37A β-catenin decays at a significantly slower rate (Fig. 3, upper panel, lanes 1–5). In the absence of troglitazone, both proteins (WT and S37A) are quite stable throughout the 8-h time period. It is interesting to note that the abundance and rate of turnover of PPARγ itself appears to be affected by both troglitazone and S37A β-catenin. Specifically, the level of expression of PPARγ following 16 h of exposure to troglitazone is significantly higher in the cells expressing S37A β-catenin than in those expressing WT protein. Furthermore, the rate of decay of PPARγ appears to be somewhat faster in the wild type cells, and this effect is particularly apparent when cells are cultured in the absence of troglitazone (Fig. 3, lanes 6–10). Stimulation of β-Catenin Signaling during the Differentiation of Swiss Pγ Cells Inhibits Expression of Select Adipogenic Genes—Previous studies have shown that activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway through the ectopic expression of Wnt 1 or Wnt 10b blocks the differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes (23Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar, 24Bennett C.N. Ross S.E. Longo K.A. Bajnok L.

Silva D. Park B.H. Liu J. Farmer S.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for this effect of Wnt signaling, we questioned whether ectopic expression of the S37A β-catenin inhibits PPARγ activity. In addressing this question, we considered it important to determine whether S37A β-catenin could stimulate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in Swiss fibroblasts expressing abundant amounts of PPARγ. A reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of total RNA from cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline demonstrates that activation of the ectopic S37A β-catenin gene induces expression of the corresponding mRNA to levels equivalent to those produced by the endogenous β-catenin gene (Fig. 4A). More importantly, expression of these moderate levels of S37A β-catenin mRNA resulted in expression of a transcriptionally active protein, which was capable of inducing expression of cyclin D1, a well known β-catenin target gene (Fig. 4B). The EMSA in Fig. 4C shows further that S37A β-catenin associates with Tcf4 to form a complex that binds to Lef/Tcf regulatory elements in the promoter of the cyclin D1 gene (compare lanes 5 and 10). Furthermore, ectopic expression of the mutant β-catenin transactivates a Tcf-based reporter gene (TOPFLASH) following its transient transfection into Swiss-Pγ/WT-β-catenin and Swiss-Pγ/S37A-β-catenin cells (Fi"

Although the function of a number of genes involved in fatty acid and mycolic acid biosynthesis is known, information relevant to the initial steps within these biosynthetic pathways is relatively sparse. Interestingly, the genomes of Corynebacterianeae possess a high number of accD genes, whose gene products resemble the β-subunit of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase of Escherichia coli, providing the activated intermediate for fatty acid synthesis. We present here our studies on four putative accD genes found in C. glutamicum. Although growth of the accD4 mutant remained unchanged, growth of the accD1 mutant was strongly impaired and partially recovered by the addition of exogenous oleic acid. Overexpression of accD1 and accBC, encoding the carboxylase α-subunit, resulted in an 8-fold increase in malonyl-CoA formation from acetyl-CoA in cell lysates, providing evidence that accD1 encodes a carboxyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA. Interestingly, fatty acid profiles remained unchanged in both our accD2 and accD3 mutants, but a complete loss of mycolic acids, either as organic extractable trehalose and glucose mycolates or as cell wall-bound mycolates, was observed. These two carboxyltransferases are also retained in all Corynebacterianeae, including Mycobacterium leprae, constituting two distinct groups of orthologs. Furthermore, carboxyl fixation assays, as well as a study of a Cg-pks deletion mutant, led us to conclude that accD2 and accD3 are key to mycolic acid biosynthesis, thus providing a carboxylated intermediate during condensation of the mero-chain and α-branch directed by the pks-encoded polyketide synthase. This study illustrates that the high number of accD paralogs have evolved to represent specific variations on the well known basic theme of providing carboxylated intermediates in lipid biosynthesis.

The Corynebacterianeae represent a distinct and unusual group within Gram-positive bacteria, with the most prominent members being the human pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 2Stackebrandt E. Rainey F.A. Ward-Rainey N.L. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 479-491Crossref Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). In addition, nonpathogenic bacteria belong to this taxon, such as Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is used in the industrial production of amino acids (3Eggeling L. Pfefferle W. Sahm H. Ratledge C. Kristiansen B. Basic Biotechnology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2001: 281-302Google Scholar). A common feature to all these bacteria is that they possess unusual lipids, such as mycolic acids (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar).Mycolic acids are long chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxylated fatty acids (R-CH(OH)-CH(R′)-COOH), where R represents the meromycolate chain consisting in M. tuberculosis of up to 56 carbons possessing additional structural modifications, and R′ represents a shorter aliphatic branch possessing 22–26 carbons). These two chains are then condensed together via a specialized Claisen condensation enzyme, followed by reduction to yield mature mycolic acids (4Kremer L. Baulard A.R. Besra G.S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. ASM Press, Washington D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar). In contrast, mycolic acids from Corynebacterium species, including C. glutamicum, represent the simplest form of these lipids, whereby two C16 fatty acids condense together, followed by reduction to afford a C32 mycolic acid. These α-branched, β-hydroxy fatty acids are found primarily as esters of the nonreducing arabinan terminus of arabinogalactan (5McNeil M.R. Daffe M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13217-13223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mycolic acids can also be found as extractable “free” lipids within the cell wall, mainly linked to glucose and trehalose (6Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of Mycobacteria. Academic Press Ltd., London1982: 95-184Google Scholar). These mycolic acids and their derivatives are believed to play a crucial role in the architecture of the cell envelope (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar).Interestingly, M. tuberculosis is characterized by an exceptionally high number of additional lipids and glycolipids, which are thought to aid in the persistence of the bacterium, thereby fueling the promise of the identification of new drug targets in the context of tuberculosis (7Kremer L.S. Besra G.S. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1033-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The rich diversity of lipids present in M. tuberculosis is reflected at the genomic level by a panoply of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis (8Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T.

Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6450) Google Scholar), some of them constituting sets of paralogous genes. For instance, M. tuberculosis has 35 fadD genes (annotated as fatty acid-CoA ligases), 16 pks genes (annotated as polyketide synthases), and six accD genes (annotated as acyl-CoA carboxylases), and their detailed function in lipid biosynthesis and relevance for persistence are only now emerging (8Cole S.T.

Cell. 2001; 104: 477-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Importantly, Corynebacterium species are considered the archetype within Corynebacterianeae, including M. tuberculosis, due to a low frequency of gene duplications and structural alterations giving rise to a strong conservation at the genomic level within this subgroup of the Corynebacterianeae (10Nakamura Y. Nishio Y. Ikeo K. Gojobori T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 317: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Together with their simpler chemical composition (as outlined above for mycolic acids), it can therefore be assumed that species of Corynebacterium have at their disposal just the core set of genes and reactions characteristic for the Corynebacterianeae. Indeed, C. glutamicum possesses just three fadD, one pks, and four accD genes (11Kalinowski J. Bathe B. Bartels D. Bischoff N. Bott M. Burkovski A. Dusch N. Eggeling L. Eikmanns B.J. Gaigalat L.

As a result, comparative studies using C. glutamicum have been employed in understanding the role of several M. tuberculosis proteins, e.g. Ppm1/D2 in lipoarabinomannan biosynthesis (12Gibson K.J.

Microbiology (Read.). 2004; 150: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The group of four accD genes in C. glutamicum is interesting, and little is known about the function of these genes in Corynebacterianeae. These genes encode polypeptides with similarities to the β-subunits of acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylases, and basically only one of them would be sufficient for the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to provide malonyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis. This suggests additional and specific carboxylations, probably involved in the synthesis of unusual lipids.In this context, the still controversial issue of mycolic acid synthesis is very attractive to consider carboxylation reactions. Cell-free extracts of Corynebacterium have been shown to utilize [14C]palmitic acid (17Shimakata T. Iwaki M. Kusaka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Shimakata T. Tsubokura A.K. Kusaka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), with the newly synthesized mycolic acid exclusively labeled at C-1 and C-3 (19Walker R.W. Prome J.C. Lacave C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Claisen condensation reaction was hypothesized to involve a carboxylation step since it is inhibited by avidin, an inhibitor of biotin-dependent enzymes in extracts of Corynebacterium diphtheriae that produces the putative precursor of mycolic acids, 2-tetradecyl-3-oxo-octadecanoic acid (19Walker R.W. Prome J.C. Lacave C.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 326: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Ahibo-Coffy A. Aurelle H. Lacave C. Prome J.C. Puzo G. Savagnac A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1978; 22: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, avidin has no effect on the Claisen condensation reaction in a cell-free extract of Corynebacterium matruchotii, which synthesizes mature mycolic acids (17Shimakata T. Iwaki M. Kusaka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Shimakata T. Tsubokura A.K. Kusaka T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). What seems to support this last observation is the incorporation of [2,2-2H]palmitic acid in whole cells of C. matruchotii (21Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, a polyketide synthase from C. glutamicum (Cg-pks), the equivalent of M. tuberculosis pks13, that apparently plays a key role in mycolic acid biosynthesis was identified (22Portevin D. De Sousa-D'Auria C. Houssin C. Grimaldi C. Chami M. Daffe M. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar).The study is centered on the four accD genes, with the latter located at the 3′-end of Cg-pks. As a result, we present our systematic study on lipid and mycolic acid biosynthesis based on defined C. glutamicum mutants, focusing on the relevance of the accD genes along with a phylogenomic analysis of these genes in Corynebacterium and Mycobacterium species whose genomes are established (8Cole S.T.

Barrell B.G. Nature. 2001; 409: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli DH5αmcr and C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (the wild-type strain; referred to throughout as C. glutamicum) were grown in LB broth (Difco) at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. The mutants generated in this study were grown on LBHIS complex medium (5 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter NaCl, 2.5 g/liter yeast extract, 18.5 g/liter brain-heart infusion (Difco), and 90.1 g/liter sorbitol). Kanamycin and ampicillin were used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. CGIII medium and CGXII medium (26Keilhauer C. Eggeling L. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5595-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for C. glutamicum with 30 mg/liter protocatechuic acid being added to CGXII as a chelating agent. Samples for lipid analyses were prepared by harvesting cells at A = 10–15, followed by a saline wash and freezedrying. Growth comparisons of the four accD mutants were performed on unsupplemented CGXII and LBHIS plates and on LBHIS plates supplemented with 0.03% (w/v) sodium oleate, 0.03% (w/v) Tween 40, 0.04% (w/v) Brij 35, and 0.03% (w/v) butter hydrolysate.Construction of Plasmids—To enable chromosomal inactivation of the four accD genes of C. glutamicum, internal fragments were amplified by PCR and blunt end-ligated using the Sure cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences) into the SmaI site of the non-replicative vector pK18mob (27Schafer A. Tauch A. Jaeger W. Kalinowski J. Thierbach G. Puehler A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The primers used were accD1MuF10 (5′-GCA TGT GCA GGT GGC AAC GC-3′), accD1MuR11 (5′-GGT AAT CTT TGG AAC GGT TGC-3′), accD2MuF30 (5′-GTC ACG TGT ACT CCC CT-3′), accD2MuR31 (5′-CAA GCG AAT ACG AGG TC-3′), accD3MuF40 (5′-GTT GTA GGC GTC GCA GAT AC-3′), accD3MuR41 (5′-GCG TCC TCT GAA GAA GAG-3′), paccD4intfor (5′-TGG GGT TCA TCT GGG CAT CTC AC-3′), and paccD4intrev (5′-TGC CCC CAA CGT TTC CAT AAT CTC-3′). The inactivation vectors derived were termed pK18mobaccD1-int, pK18mobaccD2-int, pK18mobaccD3-int, and pK18mobaccD4-int.The in-frame deletion of Cg-pks in C. glutamicum was achieved with pK19mobsacBΔpks. Cross-over PCR was used to enable one-step integration of fragments containing upstream and downstream sequences of Cg-pks into pK19mobsacB. In the first PCR round, two separate amplification products were generated using primer pair pCipks (5′-TGT TTA AGT TTA GTG GAT GGG AGT CGC CGC ATT GAT GAG ATT TC-3′) and pCopks (5′-GGA ATT CGA CAG CGG AAG CTG ACG ACG-3′) and primer pair pNopks (5′-GGA ATT CCG TTG GCA CTG CAC ACG GTG-3′) and pNipks-2 (5′-CCC ATC CAC TAA ACT TAA ACA CTT CTG ATC CGA CGA TTG GCT CTG-3′). Both PCR products were purified and used as a template for amplification (using primers pCopks and pNopks) of a fragment devoid of Cg-pks that was treated with EcoRI and ligated with EcoRI-cleaved pK19mobsacB, yielding pK19mobsacBΔpks. The inserts in constructs used in this study were verified by sequencing.Genomic Mutations—The non-replicative integration and deletion vectors were usually introduced via electroporation, but conjugation was used when electroporation failed. Conjugation was carried out using E. coli S17-1 as the donor, and its sensitivity to nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml) was used after plating for counterselection. Selection of recombinant C. glutamicum strains for integration of the four pK18mob-int vectors was performed using 15 μg/ml kanamycin. The correct integration of sequences into the chromosome and the absence of sequences, respectively, in the resulting recombinants were verified by PCR using two different primer pairs and by Southern analysis.To achieve deletion of Cg-pks, plasmid pK19mobsacBΔpks was introduced into C. glutamicum by electroporation. Selection for resistance to kanamycin in at least 20 independent assays yielded regularly a number of clones indicating integration of the vector in the chromosome by homologous recombination. At least 100 clones derived from independent electroporation experiments were subjected to the subsequent selection for the second homologous recombination event. In this round, the presence of sacB (together with the addition of 10% sucrose to the medium) resulted in a positive selection of clones in which vector sequences were lost. Small colonies picked after 10 days were analyzed for deletion of Cg-pks. Of 60 colonies analyzed, 19 exhibited the loss of Cg-pks. One of these was further analyzed by Southern blot analysis, and the resulting strain, Cg-Δpks, was used in all subsequent studies.Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from accD1–4 mutants and the Cg-pks mutant and cleaved with BstEII. The resulting fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a Nytran NY13N nitrocellulose membrane, with subsequent washings according to standard protocols. Detection was carried out with fragments of the accD genes as probes that were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG labeling and detection kit, Roche Applied Science). For accD1–4, the SacI-BglII, PvuII-SgrAI, ClaI-StuI, and SfuI-PvuI fragments were used, respectively. For Cg-Δpks analysis, the 645-bp fragment used was generated by PCR with primers pNopks and ppksACPintrev (5′-CAA CAT CGC GAG AGG AAA GG-3′).Extraction and Analysis of 14C-Labeled Lipids—LBHIS medium (5 ml) was inoculated with a single colony of the accD1–4 and Cg-pks mutants, respectively, and shaken at 120 rpm overnight at 30 °C. An aliquot (1 ml) of this culture was used to inoculate 5 ml of CGIII medium and grown again overnight. This second pre-culture was used to inoculate 5 ml of CGXII medium to give a starting absorbance of ∼0.2. Cells were incubated at 30 °C until A = 0.4, at which point, 5 μCi/ml [14C]acetate (62 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) was added, followed by overnight incubation with shaking at room temperature. Cells were harvested, washed, and freeze-dried.Free lipids were extracted by two consecutive extractions with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v) for 3 h at 50 °C. These lipid extracts were combined with 1.75 ml of CHCl3 and 0.75 ml of water, mixed, and centrifuged. The lower organic phase was recovered and washed twice with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:47:48, v/v/v), and the resulting organic phase was dried and resuspended in 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (10:10:3, v/v/v). An aliquot (20,000 cpm) from each strain was subjected to TLC using Silica Gel 60 F254 plates (Merck) developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (60:16:2, v/v/v). Autoradiograms were produced by 2–3-day exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film to reveal 14C-labeled lipids and compared with known standards (28Puech V. Bayan N. Salim K. Leblon G. Daffe M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1026-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The bound lipids from the delipidated extracts were released by the addition of 2 ml of a 5% aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, followed by overnight incubation at 95 °C. After cooling, water (2 ml), CH2Cl2 (4 ml), and CH3I (500 μl) were added and mixed thoroughly for 30 min. The lower organic phase was recovered following centrifugation, washed three times with water (4 ml), dried, and resuspended in diethyl ether (4 ml). After centrifugation, the clear supernatant was again dried and resuspended in CH2Cl2 (200 μl). An aliquot (10,000 cpm) from each strain was subjected to TLC using Silica Gel 60 F254 plates developed in petroleum ether/acetone (95:5, v/v). Autoradiograms were produced by overnight exposure to Kodak X-Omat AR film to reveal 14C-labeled fatty acid and mycolic acid methyl esters and compared with known standards (21Lee R.E. Armour J.W. Takayama K. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Acyl Carboxylation Assay—To assay acyl carboxylase activity, we adapted the method of Rainwater and Kolattukudy (29Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 905-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a clarified lysate of the appropriate strain was prepared by resuspending the bacterial cultures to a density of 0.5 g (wet weight)/ml in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The cell paste was lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell (19,000 p.s.i., cell pre-chilled to 4 °C), and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and stored on ice until assayed. Assay mixtures (100 μl) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), 5 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Me2SO, 0.9 mm acyl substrate (acetyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, or palmitic acid), 65 mg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μCi of NaH14CO3 (0.1 Ci/mol; CFA421, Amersham Biosciences), and 250 μg of total protein from the lysate. All of the components of the assay excluding the enzyme extract were premixed and then mixed with the enzyme extract to initiate the reaction, which was held at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of concentrated HCl. This mixture was then held at 95 °C under a stream of air to remove non-fixed 14CO2. After evaporation to dryness, the residue was dissolved in 1 ml of water and added to 10 ml of Ecoscint A (National Diagnostics, Inc.) prior to liquid scintillation counting.Acetyl-CoA Carboxylation Assay—To assay for acetyl-CoA-dependent malonyl-CoA formation, cells grown on CGIII medium were washed twice with 0.9% NaCl, resuspended in 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), and disrupted as described above. Assay mixtures (250 μl) contained 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 65 mm KHCO3, 1mm ATP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 135 μl of cell extract. The mixture was preincubated at 30 °C for 1 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of acetyl-CoA (lithium salt, Roche Applied Science) to give a final concentration of 2 mm and further incubated at 30 °C. Samples were taken at the given time intervals and mixed immediately with 5 μl of 30% perchloric acid to quench the reaction. The assay tubes were centrifuged subsequently (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), and 50 μl of the supernatant was withdrawn, neutralized with 12.5 μl of Na2CO3, and analyzed via HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ACP, acyl carrier protein. Acyl-CoA synthesis was monitored by reversed-phase chromatography using a LiChrospher 1000 RP 18-EC-5μ column (125 × 4 mm; Merck) on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC apparatus. Samples (12 μl) were automatically injected and separated by an increasing gradient consisting of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 2% acetonitrile, increasing up to 26% acetonitrile in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and monitored at 254 nm. Reactions were compared with known standards of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and CoA (0.1–1 mm) dissolved in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 3.0).RESULTSaccD Genes of Corynebacterianeae—From the recent Himar1-based transposon mutagenesis in M. tuberculosis (30Sassetti C.M. Boyd D.H. Rubin E.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar), accD4 and accD6 were found to be essential genes, whereas accD1 and accD3 were found to be nonessential. In terms of accD1 (previously dtsR1) of C. glutamicum, an involvement in l-glutamate formation that is related to fatty acid synthesis was demonstrated (31Kimura E. Abe C. Kawahara Y. Nakamatsu T. Tokuda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To address the problem regarding functional similarities of the carboxyltransferase proteins, we performed a phylogenomic analysis of the accD genes present in the genomes of the sequenced Corynebacterianeae (8Cole S.T.

The loss of an electron destabilizes the cluster, causing it to release its catalytic iron atom and converting the cluster initially to an inactive [3Fe-4S]1+ form. Continued exposure to oxidants in vitro leads to further iron release. Experiments have shown that these clusters are repaired in vivo. We sought to determine whether repair is mediated by either the Isc or Suf cluster-assembly systems that have been identified in Escherichia coli. We found that all the proteins encoded by the isc operon were critical for de novo assembly, but most of these were unnecessary for cluster repair. IscS, a cysteine desulfurase, appeared to be an exception: although iscS mutants repaired damaged clusters, they did so substantially more slowly than did wild-type cells. Because sulfur mobilization should be required only if clusters degrade beyond the [3Fe-4S]1+ state, we used whole cell EPR to visualize the fate of oxidized enzymes in vivo. Fumarase A was overproduced. Brief exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide resulted in the appearance of the characteristic [3Fe-4S]1+ signal of the oxidized enzyme. When hydrogen peroxide was then scavenged, the enzyme activity reappeared within minutes, in concert with the disappearance of the EPR signal. Thus it is unclear why IscS is required for efficient repair. The iscS mutants grew poorly, allowing the possibility that metabolic defects indirectly slow the repair process. Our data did indicate that damaged clusters decompose beyond the [3Fe-4S]1+ state in vivo when stress is prolonged. Under the conditions of our experiments, mutants that lacked other repair candidates—Suf proteins, glutathione, and NADPH: ferredoxin reductase—all repaired clusters at normal rates. We conclude that the mechanism of cluster repair is distinct from that of de novo assembly and that this is true because mild oxidative stress does not degrade clusters in vivo to the point of presenting an apoenzyme to the de novo cluster-assembly systems.

Proteins employ iron-sulfur clusters for a variety of purposes. Although clusters were first recognized for their participation in electron-transfer reactions, they also serve as catalytic Lewis acids in a family of dehydratases (1Flint D.H. Emptage M.H. Barak Z.

To bind substrate, these clusters must be situated in the protein so that they are exposed to solvent.

Oxidation converts the cluster to a metastable form that rapidly degrades as in Reactions 1 and 2,Ox+[4Fe-4S]2+→Red+[4Fe-4S]3+Reaction 1 [4Fe-4S]3+→[3Fe-4S]1++Fe2+ Reaction 2 The iron atom that is lost is essential for catalysis, and so the oxidized enzymes are inactive. Indeed, mutants of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lack superoxide dismutases struggle to grow in aerobic media (5Carlioz A. Touati D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 6Chang E.C. Crawford B.F. Hong Z. Bilinski T. Kosman D.J. J. Biol.

A. 1986; 83: 3820-3824Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), because superoxide rapidly oxidizes these dehydratases, thereby disabling the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways to which they belong (8Kuo C.F. Mashino T. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4724-4727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5892-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite are also physiological oxidants that inactivate these enzymes (4Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Keyer K. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27652-27659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Varghese S.M. Tang Y. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The rate constant for inactivation by superoxide is so high (∼106–107m–1 s–1) that it is likely that even wild-type cells contain enough superoxide to continually damage these enzymes. Their half-life has been estimated to be 40 min in aerobic E. coli (14Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In response, bacterial cells have acquired the ability to repair the damaged clusters. This repair capacity becomes evident when superoxide-stressed cells are restored to an anaerobic environment: the activities of the labile dehydratases quickly rebound to normal levels, even in the absence of new protein synthesis. The half-time for cluster repair is about 5 min (12Keyer K. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27652-27659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, during normal, aerobic growth the steady-state activity of these enzymes reflects the dynamic balance between enzyme oxidation and repair. The mechanism of repair remains unknown. At minimum, conversion of a [3Fe-4S]1+ cluster back to the active [4Fe-4S]2+ form requires both reduction and metallation, probably in that order to avoid the unstable [4Fe-4S]3+ intermediate. However, in in vitro studies the oxidized [3Fe-4S]1+ form has been observed to decompose further, raising the possibility that in vivo the cluster degrades completely to an apoenzyme form (4Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Varghese S.M. Tang Y. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). If so, then cluster repair might utilize the same pathway that originally assembles the cluster in newly synthesized proteins. This process is assisted in E. coli by proteins encoded by the isc gene products. A null mutation in the E. coli iscS reduced the activities of several cluster-containing enzymes by 50–98% (16Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). E. coli iscS is encoded within the iscSUA-hscAB-fdx gene cluster, and mutations of iscU, hscAB, and fdx similarly diminished the activities of the cluster-containing enzymes succinate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase (17Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Similar results from partial loss-of-function mutations in yeast imply that these functions are broadly conserved (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Garland S. Smolen G.A. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The specific roles of the various isc gene products are only partly understood. IscS, the first member of this system to be identified (19Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 21Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), is a pyridoxal phosphate-containing cysteine desulfurase that provides atomic sulfur during cluster assembly. IscU and IscA transiently acquire clusters in the presence of IscS, cysteine, and ferrous iron, and the clusters can subsequently be transferred to an apoenzyme substrate (22Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14069-14080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 23Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Thus these proteins appear to serve as protein scaffolds for assembly of the nascent cluster. Although the roles of HscAB and ferredoxin have not been biochemically identified, the former proteins have chaperone activity and may either assist in maintaining the apoenzyme substrate in a structure receptive to insertion of the cluster or stabilize IscU to promote cluster transfer. The latter is suggested by the recent NMR structure of IscU, which shows an ordered secondary structure but almost no tertiary structure in solution (24Mansy S.S. Wu G. Surerus K.K. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21397-21404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Ferredoxin may adjust the redox state of the cluster either before or after insertion. In any case, a variety of methods have detected physical interactions among these proteins (25Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may operate in vivo as a complex. When mammalian IRP-1 (a cytosolic aconitase) was overproduced and then oxidized in yeast, some [3Fe-4S]1+ form was detected (29Brown N.M. Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Eisenstein R.S. Walden W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7246-7254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is difficult to see how the Isc scaffold-based insertion system could operate upon oxidized enzymes if the enzymes retain any form of cluster in the active site. This has raised the possibility that enzyme repair is catalyzed instead by a system distinct from Isc. E. coli expresses an iscS homologue, sufS, as part of the sufABCDSE operon (30Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cysteine desulfurase activity of SufS has been confirmed (31Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. 1999; 127: 559-567Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 32Outten F.W. Wood M.J. Munoz F.M. Storz G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45713-45719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In an otherwise wild-type background, mutants that lack the suf genes do not exhibit an overt phenotype and have wild-type levels of cluster-enzyme activity. However, isc suf double mutants of E. coli are inviable, indicating that suf provides the residual cluster-assembly activity that is observed in the absence of isc (33Takahashi Y. Tokumoto U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28380-28383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 34Outten F.W. Djaman O. Storz G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 861-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The fact that suf products evidently are minor catalysts of cluster assembly has provided impetus to the possibility that their normal physiological role may be to repair oxidized enzymes. In fact, the suf genes are induced in response to hydrogen peroxide exposure (35Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The goal of this work was to determine whether the machinery that catalyzes the de novo assembly of iron-sulfur clusters is also responsible for their repair after oxidation. To do so we compared the requirements for the Isc and Suf gene products in each of these processes. Chemicals and Enzymes—d-Gluconic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, plumbagin, α-ketoglutarate, l-glutamine, malic acid, 6-phosphogluconate, NADP+, NADH, deaminoNADH, deaminoNAD+, dithiothreitol, hydrogen peroxide, horse heart cytochrome c, xanthine, xanthine oxidase, catalase, bovine erythrocyte copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.), rabbit muscle lactic dehydrogenase, horseradish peroxidase, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, tetracyclin, ampicillin, and spectinomycin were purchased from Sigma. Coomassie protein reagent was obtained from Pierce. Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, sodium nitrite, isocitrate, nicotinic acid, and manganese chloride were purchased from Aldrich. Sodium citrate dihydrate was from Fisher Scientific. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Invitrogen. Ready-to-go PCR beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Water was purified from a Labconco Water Pro PS system by using house deionized water as the feedstock. Culture Media and Growth Conditions—Aerobic cell cultures were routinely grown at 37 °C in flasks with shaking at 250 rpm. Anaerobic cultures were grown in a Coy chamber (Coy Laboratory Products Inc.) at 37 °C under 85% N2, 10% H2, and 5% CO2 without shaking. The media were made anaerobic by placing them in the anaerobic chamber immediately after autoclaving and storing them there for at least 24 h before use. For measurement of doubling times, cells from an overnight culture were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium, cultured to an A600 of 0.2–0.3, re-diluted to an A600 of 0.010, and finally monitored by absorbance at 600 nm. Defined media in exponential growth experiments contained minimal A salts (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 32Google Scholar) and either 0.2% glucose, 40 mm glycerol, or 40 mm succinate. The compositions of other media are indicated in the “enzymatic assays” section below. When necessary, media were also supplemented with 25 mg/liter nicotinic acid, 5 mg/liter thiamine, 50 mg/liter ampicillin, 40 mg/liter kanamycin, 20 mg/liter chloramphenicol, and/or 12 mg/liter tetracycline. Strains and Plasmids—The strains used in this study were derived from E. coli K12 and are listed in Table I. Isogenic strains were used in all experiments. Disruptions in iscU and iscA were created by deletion of the open reading frame and insertion of a chloramphenicol marker according to the Datsenko-Wanner method (37Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11196) Google Scholar). The pairs of primers that were used to amplify the chloramphenicol cassette from a pDT3 plasmid are indicated in Table II. Mutant genes were routinely moved to other backgrounds using P1 transduction. Selected recombinants and transductants were confirmed to have an insertion-deletion mutation by PCR analysis. Strain OD320 was made by transducing the srl-300::Tn10 insertion (38Csonka L.N. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 529-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into JTG10 (gshA::kan) (39Greenberg J.T. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and selecting for tetracycline resistance. The srl-300::Tn10 and gshA::kan alleles were then cotransduced into OD311, selecting for tetracycline resistance, and screening biochemically for deficiency of glutathione. Strain OD330 was made by transducing the sodA::cm insertion into c-6008 (40Bianchi V. Haggard-Ljungquist E. Pontis E. Reichard P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4528-4531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sodA::cm and fpr::kan alleles were then cotransduced into OD310 (sodB::kan), with selection for chloramphenicol resistance. The disruption of fpr gene was confirmed by PCR.Table IE. coli strainsStrainGenotypeReferenceMG1655F- wild-typeE. coli Genetic Stock CenterMC4100araD139 Δ(argF-lac)169 λ- flhD5301 fruA25 relA1 rpsL150 rbsR22 deoC1E. coli Genetic Stock CenterBW25113ΔaraBADAH33 ΔlacZWJ16 rrnBT14 lacIq rph-1 ΔrhaBADLD78 hsdR514(37Datsenko K.A.

These plasmids were transformed into JH400, which lacks chromosomal copies of fumA, fumB, and fumC. For the purpose of complementation, the fdx and hscA genes were expressed from pTrc99 plasmids without 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Manganese-containing superoxide dismutase, encoded by sodA, was expressed from its own promoter on pBR322. EPR Analysis of H2O2-treated Cells—Cells were grown aerobically in 500 ml of LB medium (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 32Google Scholar) containing 1 mm 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After approximately 3 h of incubation (A600 between 0.2 and 0.5), cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 1% the original culture volume in 10% cold glycerol. A 250-μl aliquot was loaded into a quartz EPR tube as an untreated control and immediately frozen on dry ice. To the remainder of the suspension H2O2 was added to final concentration of 4 mm, and a 250-μl aliquot was frozen in an EPR tube. Aliquots (50 μl) for enzymatic assays were simultaneously removed and frozen. To end the H2O2 exposure, catalase was added to the cell suspension (200 units/ml final concentration). Aliquots were removed and frozen at subsequent time points. EPR spectra were recorded using a Varian E-122 X-band spectrometer. Equipment settings were as follows: microwave power, 1 or 0.2 milliwatt; microwave frequency, 9.05 GHz; modulation amplitude, 8.0 Gauss at 100 KHz; time constant, 0.032. Samples were run at 12–16 K using an Air Products Helitran cryostat. Scanning time of each spectrum was 1 min; 8 scans were averaged. The magnetic field was calibrated with a Varian NMR Gauss meter, and the microwave frequency was determined with an EIP frequency meter. Enzymatic Assays—Cultures for assays of enzymatic activities were grown to 0.4–0.7 A600 in media that would ensure consistent, substantial synthesis of the relevant enzymes. In all cases except that of fumarase, the media were chosen to minimize a dependence on Fe-S enzymes for energy production. NADH dehydrogenase I and succinate dehydrogenase were assayed by using inverted membrane vesicles prepared from cells grown in minimal A salts supplemented with 1% casein hydrolysate, 0.5% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl (pH 7). For aconitase assays cells were grown in LB medium; for 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase assays, in minimal A salts that containing 0.2% gluconate and 0.2% casein hydrolysate; for glutamate synthase, in minimal A salts containing 0.2% glucose; and for fumarase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, in minimal A salts containing 40 mm fumarate. All assays but that of succinate dehydrogenase were performed at room temperature. Because NADH dehydrogenase I is unstable at high pH, vesicles for assay of this enzyme were prepared by sonication in 50 mm MES, pH 6. NADH dehydrogenase I activity was measured by the oxidation of deaminoNADH (41Meinhardt S.W. Matsushita K. Kaback H.R. Ohnishi T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2153-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which is not a substrate for NADH dehydrogenase II. When not purchased from Sigma, deaminoNADH was prepared by the enzymatic reduction of deaminoNAD+ using the protocol for NADH preparation (42Rafter G.W. Colowick S.P. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 887-890Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Succinate/quinone oxidoreductase activity was determined by plumbagin-dependent cytochrome c reduction (43Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 37 °C to fully activate the enzyme. Because anaerobiosis and high protein concentration are essential for maintenance of the full activity of aconitase, cell extracts were prepared by sonication in cold anaerobic 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 1% the original culture volume, in the anaerobic chamber. The final protein concentration of the extract was ∼30 mg/ml, which is sufficient to prevent the spontaneous demetallation of AcnB (13Varghese S.M. Tang Y. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Aliquots were immediately diluted into 100 mm isocitrate in the Tris buffer and sealed inside air-tight cuvettes, and activity was quantified by the appearance of cis-aconitate (44Henson C.P. Cleland W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3833-3838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because a minority of aconitase activity in cell extracts derives from the stable isozyme aconitase A, this latter activity was determined by the inactivation of aconitase B by treatment with 1 mm EDTA for 1 h before assay; the residual activity was then subtracted from the total aconitase activity to yield the activity of aconitase B. Total fumarase activity was assayed by the conversion of 50 mm malate to fumarate. To distinguish the oxidatively labile fumarase A isozyme from the stable fumarase C, fumarase A was inactivated by exposure of the extract to superoxide formed by xanthine oxidase for 15 min at room temperature before re-assay (14Gort A.S. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The residual activity was due to fumarase C. The activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase was assayed by the two-step procedure for the determination of pyruvate (45Fraenkel D.G. Horecker B.L. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2035497705,"CCN1 (CYR61) is a matricellular inducer of angiogenesis essential for successful vascular development. Though devoid of the canonical RGD sequence motif recognized by some integrins, CCN1 binds to, and functions through integrin αvβ3 to promote pro-angiogenic activities in activated endothelial cells. In this study we identify a 20-residue sequence, V2 (NCKHQCTCIDGAVGCIPLCP), in domain II of CCN1 as a novel binding site for integrin αvβ3. Immobilized synthetic V2 peptide supports αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion; soluble V2 peptide inhibits endothelial cell adhesion to CCN1 and the homologous family members CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) or CCN3 (NOV) but not to collagen. These activities are obliterated by mutation of the aspartate residue in the V2 peptide to alanine. The corresponding D125A mutation in the context of the N-terminal half of CCN1 (domains I and II) greatly diminished direct solid phase binding to purified integrin αvβ3 and abolished αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion activity. Likewise, soluble full-length CCN1 with the D125A mutation is defective in binding purified αvβ3 and impaired in αvβ3-mediated pro-angiogenic activities in vascular endothelial cells, including stimulation of cell migration and enhancement of DNA synthesis. In contrast, immobilized full-length CCN1-D125A mutant binds αvβ3 and supports αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion similar to wild type CCN1. These results indicate that V2 is the primary αvβ3 binding site in soluble CCN1, whereas additional cryptic αvβ3 binding site(s) in the C-terminal half of CCN1 becomes exposed when the protein is immobilized. Together, these results identify a novel and functionally important binding site for integrin αvβ3 and provide a new approach for dissecting αvβ3-specific CCN1 functions both in cultured cells and in the organism.

(cysteine-rich 61, CYR61) is a secreted, extracellular matrix-associated protein that regulates a broad spectrum of cellular activities, including cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation in mesenchymal cells (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Consistent with its expression in the developing vasculature, CCN1 promotes pro-angiogenic activities upon endothelial cells in vitro and induces neovascularization in vivo (2O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F.

The essential role of CCN1 in vessel development has been established in gene targeting studies, as Ccn1-null mice suffer embryonic death primarily due to vascular defects in both the placenta and the embryo (5Mo F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8709-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). CCN1 can also regulate a set of genes that control angiogenesis and matrix remodeling (6Chen C.-C. Mo F.-E. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Consistent with this notion, overexpression of CCN1 is associated with cutaneous and skeletal wound repair (6Chen C.-C. Mo F.-E. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Encoded by a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, CCN1 is a cysteine-rich heparin-binding protein of ∼40 kDa (15O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Upon secretion, CCN1 is non-covalently associated with the extracellular matrix and the cell surface, in equilibrium with a fraction that exists in the culture medium (16Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar). A member of the CCN protein family, CCN1 shares sequence homology with five other proteins in vertebrates: CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF), CCN3 (nephroblastoma overexpressed, NOV), CCN4 (WISP-1, ELM-1), CCN5 (WISP-2, COP-1), and CCN6 (WISP-3) (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 17Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 18Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Structurally, CCN proteins are characterized by the presence of an N-terminal secretory signal followed by four distinct modular domains with homology to insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (domain I), von Willebrand factor type C repeat (VWC, domain II), thrombospondin type I repeat (TSP1 domain III), and regions of Slit and mucins (CT, domain IV) (Fig. 1A; Ref. 19Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Given their regulatory rather than structural roles, CCN proteins can be considered “matricellular” signaling molecules (20Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 21Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). In keeping with their structural roots in extracellular matrix proteins, CCN proteins are ligands of and act through distinct integrin receptors in a cell-type and context-specific manner (22Kireeva M.L.

Integrin αvβ3 is highly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells and has been implicated in angiogenic processes (27Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Cancer J. 2000; 6: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). Although CCN1 does not possess the canonical RGD sequence motif present in a number of αvβ3 ligands, it binds αvβ3 directly and mediates a number of pro-angiogenic activities through this integrin in activated vascular endothelial cells, including supporting cell adhesion, stimulating chemotaxis, enhancing DNA synthesis, promoting cell survival, and inducing tubule formation (22Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 28Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol.

Like CCN1, both CCN2 and CCN3 also bind αvβ3, induce angiogenesis in vivo, and stimulate pro-angiogenic activities in endothelial cells through an integrin αvβ3-dependent mechanism (29Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shimo T. Nakanishi T. Nishida T. Asano M. Kanyama M. Kuboki T. Tamatani T. Tezuka K. Takemura M. Matsumura T.

Therefore, identifying the αvβ3 binding site(s) of CCN1 will provide new insights into how these matricellular proteins interact with their receptors and help to elucidate the αvβ3-specific activities of CCN1 in developmental and pathological angiogenesis. In this study, we found that CCN1 contains multiple αvβ3 binding sites. Using biochemical, functional, and mutational approaches, we identify a novel 20-residue sequence, V2, in the VWC domain of CCN1 as a functional binding site for integrin αvβ3. We show that Asp-125 in the V2 sequence is critical for interaction with αvβ3, and a single amino acid Asp-125 → Ala substitution in the context of full-length CCN1 is sufficient to selectively impair αvβ3-mediated activities in endothelial cells, including stimulation of cell migration and enhancement of DNA synthesis. Together, these results delineate a novel αvβ3 binding site in CCN1, establish its functional significance through mutational analysis, and provide a strategy for dissecting αvβ3-specific CCN1 activities and signaling pathways both in vitro and in the context of the whole organism. Proteins, Antibodies, Peptides, and Reagents—Recombinant mouse CCN1, CCN2, and CCN3 proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system and purified from serum-free conditioned media by Sepharose S column chromatography (32Kireeva M.L.

Human vitronectin and rat tail type-I collagen were from Collaborative Research (Cambridge, MA). Function-blocking mAbs against various integrins, including β1 (JB1A), α6 (GoH3), and αvβ3 (LM609) were purchased from Chemicon, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cyr61 antibodies were affinity-purified as described (32Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Heparin (sodium salt; from porcine intestinal mucosa) was from Sigma. GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). Custom synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences of domain II (VWC domain) of CCN1 were prepared by ResGen, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and Invitrogen followed by purification on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analysis by mass spectroscopy. Construction and Purification of CCN1-D125A, CCN11-2, and CCN11-2-D125A Mutants—CCN1 mutant with the D125A substitution in domain II (CCN1-D125A) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis by PCR using the sense primer 5′-TGCACATGTATTGCTGGCGCCGTGGGCTGC and the antisense primer 5′-CGGGAATTCCTTTTAGGCTGCTGTACACTGGTTGTC. Mouse CCN1 cDNA was used as template, and the PCR product was digested with AflIII and PflMI, cutting at sites flanking the mutated sequence. The AflIII-PflMI fragment of the full-length Ccn1 cDNA in pSG5 was substituted with the mutated PCR product. The resulting construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant Ccn1 cDNA was cloned in baculovirus expression vector pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen). To construct the CCN11-2, PCR reactions upon the mouse Ccn1 cDNA were carried out using primers 5′-CGCGGATCCGGCGCTCTCCACCTGC and 5′-GGAATTCCCAGGAAGCCTCTTCAGTGAGCTGCC. The PCR product was digested with BamH1 and EcoR1 and ligated into a modified pBlueBac4.5/V5-His vector (33Leu S.J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.C. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The expressed recombinant polypeptide contained the V5 epitope and a polyhistidine tag at the C terminus and was purified from Sf9 cells using a serum-free baculovirus expression system through nickel-agarose column as described (26Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The mutant CCN11-2-D125A was constructed by swapping an XmaI-XcmI fragment from CCN1-D125A into the CCN11-2 construct, and the recombinant protein was purified as described above. Cell Culture and Cell Adhesion Assay—HUVEC were purchased from Cascade Biologics, Inc. (Portland, OR) and grown in medium provided by the company. Primary human foreskin fibroblast 1064SK (CRL-2076) from the American Type Culture Collection was kept in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (high glucose, Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergene, Purchase, NY). For adhesion assays, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) with 2.5 mm EDTA and resuspended in serum-free media (Medium 200 from Cascade Inc. for HUVEC and Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium for fibroblasts) containing 0.5% BSA as described (23Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Microtiter wells (96-well Pro-bind flat bottom assay plate from BD Biosciences) were coated with proteins or peptides diluted in phosphate-buffered saline or H2O overnight at 4 °C. After coating, the wells were blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Where indicated, reagents (antibodies, heparin, peptides, etc.) were mixed with cells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before plating. To each well 50 μl of cell suspension was plated, and after incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Adherent cells were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with methylene blue, and quantified by dye extraction and measurement of absorbance at 620 nm as described (32Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The amounts of immobilized CCN11-2 and CCN11-2-D125A protein were quantified by an ELISA using anti-domain I antibodies as primary antibodies (25Schober J.M. Chen N. Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Emeson E.E. Ugarova T.P. Ye R.D. Lau L.F. Lam S.C.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). After washing, wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and color reaction was developed using a horseradish peroxidase immunoassay kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) with absorbance measured at 420 nm. To determine the coating efficiency of V2 peptides, the plate was blocked with 2% polyvinyl alcohol instead of BSA. Immobilized peptides were measured by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with 10 μm polyethylene oxide-maleimide-activated biotin (Pierce), which reacts with the free sulfhydryl group in the cysteine residue of the peptides. The amounts of coupled biotin were quantified by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Color reaction was developed using a horseradish peroxidase immunoassay kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and absorbance was measured at 420 nm. Solid Phase Binding Assay—Binding of CCN1 and CNN1-D125A to purified integrin αvβ3 was measured by ELISA as described previously with modifications (31Lin C. Leu S.J. Chen N. Tebeau C.M. Lin S.X. Yeung C.Y. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24200-24208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Microtiter wells (Immulon 2, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with purified integrin (1 μg/ml in buffer of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 25 mm octylglucoside, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were blocked with 2% heat-inactivated BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Soluble CCN1 and CCN1-D125A were added and allowed to bind at 37 °C for 2 h; bound ligand was detected using affinity-purified anti-domain I antibodies. For integrin binding to immobilized CCN11-2 and CCN11-2-D125A, microtiter wells were coated with the indicated amount of protein at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 2% BSA, purified integrin αvβ3 (1 μg/ml) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, bound integrins were detected with polyclonal anti-integrin β3 (AB1932, Chemicon). Plates were incubated with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and color reaction was developed using a horseradish peroxidase immunoassay kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) with absorbance measured at 420 nm. To block the binding of integrin αvβ3 to CCN1 with V2 peptides, integrin αvβ3 (1 μg/ml) was preincubated with the indicated amount of peptides at room temperature for 30 min before being applied to wells coated with 10 μg/ml of CCN1. Binding was performed, and bound integrins were detected as described above. Cell Migration Assay—Cell migration was monitored as described (28Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) using Transwell chambers (Corning Costar) with tissue culture-treated filter membranes separating the upper and lower chambers. Subconfluent HUVEC were detached by 2.5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and then washed and resuspended in serum-free basal medium with 0.5% BSA at 7 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 30 min; the cell suspension (100 μl) was placed in the upper compartment of each chamber, and cells were allowed to migrate toward the indicated amount of CCN1 or CCN1-D125A diluted in 0.6 ml of assay medium in the lower chamber for 6 h in 5% CO2 during incubation at 37 °C. To block cell migration with antibodies, stimulated HUVEC were incubated with 50 μg/ml LM609 or regular mouse IgG for 30 min at room temperature before plating. After incubation, unmigrated cells that remained attached to the upper surfaces of the filters were removed by cotton swabs, and cells that migrated to the lower surfaces of the filters were fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin. Cells migrated were counted in 10 randomly selected microscopic fields at 200× magnification. Results are expressed as numbers of migrated cells per field. BrdUrd Incorporation Assay—DNA synthesis was assessed using a BrdUrd cell proliferation assay kit (Oncogene Research Products) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, subconfluent HUVEC were replated on 96-well cell culture plates (Corning, NY) at 2 × 104 cells/well in complete culture medium for 16 h and starved in serum-free basal medium with 0.5% BSA for 24 h. CCN1, CCN1-D125A, or VEGF were added to the wells alone or in combination in basal assay medium containing BrdUrd. After 24 h of incubation, cells were fixed, and incorporated BrdUrd was quantified by ELISA according to the protocol with antibodies and reagents provided with the kit. Identification of an Integrin αvβ3-binding Peptide within the VWC Domain of CCN1—Previous studies showed that a truncation mutant of CCN1 lacking precisely the CT domain (CCN11-3 or CCN1ΔCT) retains the ability to promote DNA synthesis through integrin αvβ3, indicating the presence of an αvβ3 binding site within the first three domains of CCN1 (26Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, antibodies specific for domain II of CCN1, but not those against domains I or III, inhibited αvβ3-mediated endothelial cell migration (34, Grzeszkiewicz, T. M. (2002) Cyr61-induced Cellular Activities in Wound Healing: Impact of Structure on Function. Ph.D. thesis, University of Illinois at ChicagoGoogle Scholar). These observations suggested that a binding site for αvβ3 may be located in domain II. To test this hypothesis, we prepared four overlapping synthetic peptides that encompassed the entire domain II (Fig. 1B). The ability of these peptides to support HUVEC adhesion when immobilized on microtiter wells was assessed. Of the four peptides, only V2 (corresponding to amino acid 116-135 of the mouse CCN1) was able to support HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, V2 supported HUVEC adhesion in a dose-dependent manner, with significant cell adhesion evident at a coating concentration of 0.05 mm peptide, and cell adhesion was optimal at 0.1 mm peptide (Fig. 2B). To determine whether cell adhesion to V2 was mediated through integrin αvβ3, we evaluated the effects of αvβ3 antagonists. EDTA, a general inhibitor of integrin function, blocked HUVEC adhesion to the V2 peptide (Fig. 2C). The peptide GRGDSP, which inhibits ligand binding of specific integrins including αvβ3, also abolished cell adhesion to V2. Furthermore, the αvβ3-specific mAb LM609 completely abrogated HUVEC adhesion, indicating that V2 supports cell adhesion through integrin αvβ3. HUVEC adhesion to CCN1 was inhibited partially by LM609 or GRGDSP peptides, since this process is mediated through both αvβ3 and α6β1-HSPGs (28Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). As expected, cell adhesion to vitronectin was inhibited by EDTA and GRGDSP peptide completely and by LM609 partially. Together, these results show that the V2 peptide supports dose-dependent and αvβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion, implicating the presence of an αvβ3 binding site in this peptide. To probe the specificity of V2 in cell adhesion further, we used this peptide to conduct inhibition studies. Soluble V2 peptide was able to block HUVEC adhesion to CCN1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), with significant inhibition observed at 0.2 mm V2 peptide, similar to the concentration required for linear RGD-containing peptides to inhibit ligand interactions with αv integrins (35Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17294-17298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no inhibition occurred on cell adhesion to type I collagen, which binds β1 integrins. Other members of the CCN family, including CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)) and CCN3 (NOV) have also been shown to support endothelial cell adhesion through integrin αvβ3, and their corresponding V2 sequences are highly conserved (29Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lin C. Leu S.J. Chen N. Tebeau C.M. Lin S.X. Yeung C.Y. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24200-24208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The V2 peptide was able to block HUVEC adhesion to both CCN2 and CCN3 as well (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the V2 sequences in these CCN proteins contain homologous binding sites for αvβ3. To determine whether the peptide supporting αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion can be further defined, we prepared a series of shorter peptides that contain the core sequence of V2 (Fig. 3C). None of these shorter peptides were able to support cell adhesion when immobilized (data not shown). We also used the peptides in a soluble form to inhibit cell adhesion to CCN1. Only V2, but not the shorter peptides, was able to inhibit cell adhesion (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that the full V2 sequence is required to support efficient binding to integrin αvβ3. Asp-125 Is Critical for Recognition by Integrin αvβ3—Phage display and mutational analyses indicate that an aspartic acid residue in the ligand plays a critical role in interaction with integrin αvβ3 (36Healy J.M. Murayama O. Maeda T. Yoshino K. Sekiguchi K. Kikuchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3948-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Recent structural studies demonstrated direct contact of the aspartic acid with the ligand binding pocket of αvβ3 (38Arnaout M.A. Goodman S.L. Xiong J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The V2 sequence contains Asp-125, an aspartate conserved among all CCN proteins except CCN6. To test whether Asp-125 might be critical for αvβ3 binding, we prepared a mutant synthetic V2 peptide (V2-mut) that harbors a single amino acid Asp → Ala substitution (Fig. 1B). When coated as an adhesion substrate on microtiter wells, the V2-mut peptide was completely unable to support HUVEC adhesion (Fig. 2B). Even when coated at 1 mm, a concentration 10-fold higher than necessary for wild type V2 to support optimal cell adhesion, V2-mut had no activity. In control experiments both the V2 and V2-mut peptides were able to coat plastic surfaces with equal efficiency in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D), showing that the difference in cell adhesion to the peptides was not due to differential coating. Furthermore, V2-mut was unable to inhibit HUVEC adhesion to either CCN1, CCN2, or CCN3 (Fig. 3B). Thus, the D125A mutation abolished the ability of V2 to support αvβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion, indicating that Asp-125 is a critical residue for the V2 peptide to interact with αvβ3. Cell Adhesion to CCN11-2 through Integrin αvβ3—CCN1 is organized into four discrete domains (Fig. 1A), with a protease-sensitive linker region between domains II and III (32Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E.

https://openalex.org/W2001185418,"Photosystem II (PSII) is a large membrane protein complex that catalyzes oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. During its normal function, PSII is damaged and frequently turned over. The maturation of the D1 protein, a key component in PSII, is a critical step in PSII biogenesis. The precursor form of D1 (pD1) contains a C-terminal extension, which is removed by the protease CtpA to yield PSII complexes with oxygen evolution activity. To determine the temporal position of D1 processing in the PSII assembly pathway, PSII complexes containing only pD1 were isolated from a CtpA-deficient strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803. Although membranes from the mutant cell had nearly 50% manganese, no manganese was detected in isolated ΔctpAHT3 PSII, indicating a severely decreased manganese affinity. However, chlorophyll fluorescence decay kinetics after a single saturating flash suggested that the donor YZ was accessible to exogenous Mn2+ ions. Furthermore, the extrinsic proteins PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV were not present in PSII isolated from this mutant. However, PsbO and PsbV were present in mutant membranes, but the amount of PsbV protein was consistently less in the mutant membranes compared with the control membranes. We conclude that D1 processing precedes manganese binding and assembly of the extrinsic proteins into PSII. Interestingly, the Psb27 protein was found to be more abundant in ΔctpAHT3 PSII than in HT3 PSII, suggesting a possible role of Psb27 as an assembly factor during PSII biogenesis.

Cyanobacterial PSII consists of more than 20 subunits including both membrane-integral and extrinsically associated proteins (2Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 755-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition to its protein components, PSII also has many associated cofactors including chlorophylls, pheophytins, plastoquinones, manganese, non-heme iron, calcium, and chloride atoms as well as two heme groups (2Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Pakrasi H.B. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar, 5Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar) have greatly advanced our knowledge of the arrangement of the components within the functional complex. In particular, new details on the structure of the tetra-manganese-calcium cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex have given key insights into the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction (6Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar).Despite these advances, these static structures are not adequate to understand the dynamic nature of the assembly and turn-over of the PSII complex. The structural complexity of PSII requires precise and regulated assembly, yet the PSII biogenesis pathway is poorly understood and many questions still remain as to how the components are assembled into a functional PSII complex. Furthermore, PSII assembly occurs frequently, because the PSII complex is rapidly turned over even under normal conditions (7Keren N. Berg A. van Kan P.J. Levanon H. Ohad I.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the electron transfer reactions, the D1 protein is irreversibly damaged, removed from the PSII complex, and replaced with a newly synthesized D1 protein (8Andersson B. Aro E.M. Andersson B. Regulation of Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, The Netherlands2001: 377-393Google Scholar). Thus, PSII complexes can be generated from either newly synthesized components or from partially disassembled complexes.During PSII biogenesis, several events define the assembly of the oxygen-evolving complex, namely D1 processing, manganese cluster assembly, and extrinsic protein association. The D1 protein is synthesized in a precursor form (pD1) containing a C-terminal extension of 16 amino acids in cyanobacteria (9Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and 8–9 amino acids in eukaryotes (10Takahashi Y. Nakane H. Kojima H. Satoh K.

The pD1 protein is co-translationally inserted into the thylakoid membrane, it associates with other PSII membrane components, and is cleaved after Ala-344 by CtpA, a C-terminal processing protease, to yield the mature D1 protein (12Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition, the inorganic cluster of manganese and calcium is assembled and several extrinsic proteins (PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV) associate with the luminal side of the complex. However, the temporal order of these events during PSII assembly remains poorly understood.Despite numerous studies with D1 processing mutants, it has been difficult to characterize PSII complexes from these mutants with respect to their manganese content and polypeptide compositions. Studies of D1 processing mutants have revealed that processing of pD1 is essential for the assembly of a functional manganese cluster. However, the exact number of manganese atoms associated with pD1-containing PSII complexes has been the subject of debate (12Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Letters. 1986; 205: 269-274Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Manganese measurements of membranes of the Scenedesmus obliquus LF1 mutant suggests that pD1-containing PSII complexes have only 1–2 manganese/PSII (16Metz J. Bishop N.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). EPR studies of the LF1 mutant revealed the lack of the S2 multiline signal suggesting that the LF1 mutant lacks the redox active manganese cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex (17Rutherford A. Seibert M. Metz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 932: 171-176Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analysis of thylakoid membranes from this mutant showed reduced binding of the 23-kDa protein, PsbP, and loss of the 17-kDa protein, PsbQ, suggesting that the C-terminal extension in pD1 interferes with the association of these extrinsic proteins (18Metz J.G. Bricker T.M. Seibert M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 185: 191-196Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been suggested that the extrinsic PsbO protein binds with lower affinity to PSII in the D1 mutant S345P in Synechocystis 6803 in which pD1 is not processed (19Chu H.A. Nguyen A.P. Debus R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Recent structural studies also emphasize close spatial relationship of the D1 C terminus, the manganese cluster, and the extrinsic proteins. Based on the 3.7-Å structure PSII crystal structure from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus, the C-terminal oxygen in the carboxylate of the mature D1 protein at Ala-344 can be a direct ligand to one of the manganese atoms (5Kamiya N. Shen J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). However, a more recent crystal structure from Thermosynechococcus elongatus at a 3.5 Å resolution has placed the D1 C terminus near the Ca2+ ion of the manganese-calcium cluster but did not include it as a ligand (6Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the D1 C terminus makes numerous contacts with the three extrinsic proteins, PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV (6Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2823) Google Scholar). However, it is difficult to extrapolate a temporal sequence of events from these structural details.To investigate the temporal position of D1 processing in the PSII assembly pathway, we have isolated PSII complexes containing only pD1 from a CtpA-deficient strain of Synechocystis 6803. We were unable to detect any manganese atoms associated with these PSII complexes, indicating that D1 processing is required for any stable manganese interaction. The extrinsic polypeptides of PSII, PsbO, PsbU, and PsbV were also absent, suggesting that the C-terminal extension of pD1 precludes their binding. Finally, one protein, Psb27, was found to be significantly more abundant in such PSII complexes.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—Synechocystis 6803 cultures were grown at 30 °C under 30 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 of white light in TES-buffered BG-11 medium (20Allen M.M. J. Phycol. 1968; 4: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) with air bubbling. The HT3 strain of Synechocystis 6803, which has a hexahistidine tag at the C-terminal end of the CP47 protein (21Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was a generous gift from Prof. T. M. Bricker (Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA). Growth medium for the ΔctpA cells was supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 10 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), and 3 μg/ml erythromycin, whereas growth medium for the ΔctpAHT3 cells was supplemented with 5 mm glucose, 10 μm DCMU, 5 μg/ml kanamycin, and 3 μg/ml erythromycin. Because the ΔctpA and ΔctpAHT3 cells are light-sensitive, they were cultured at a lower light intensity by wrapping culture bottles in Kimwipes.Mutant Construction—The ΔctpA deletion construct was prepared as follows. A 6-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment of Synechocystis 6803 DNA containing the ctpA locus was cloned into a pUC19 vector lacking an EcoRI site (pSL794). The ctpA locus within pSL794 (1.4 kb), which is flanked on either side by EcoRI sites, was replaced with a 1.5-kb EcoRI fragment containing an erythromycin resistance marker (pSL795). The double mutant ΔctpAHT3 was constructed by transforming HT3 cells with the ΔctpA construct. Complete segregation of the ΔctpA mutation was determined by PCR using the following primers, 5′-AAGTCCATGCTGTGGAAGC-3′ and 5′-GGATGCCTTTACTTATGGC-3′.Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence measurements were conducted to test the segregation of the ΔctpA mutation by verifying the low fluorescent ΔctpA phenotype. Briefly, HT3, ΔctpA, and ΔctpAHT3 cells were grown in BG11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose in 12-well microtiter plates. Fo and Kautsky fluorescence induction were measured on a FluorCam 690M (Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). The average Fo was calculated from a 3-s measurement before actinic illumination. Samples were then subjected to continuous actinic light (300 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) at 30% intensity for 10 s and fluorescence (F) was monitored by 33-μs measuring flashes every 40 ms. Fluorescence traces were normalized to Fo to compare the signals from different strains.Chlorophyll fluorescence decay after a single saturating flash was measured using an FL100 fluorometer (Photon Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic). PSII samples were diluted to 2 μg of Chl/ml in resuspension buffer (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 25% glycerol). Samples were incubated under ambient light for 10 min with and without the addition of 1 mm MnCl2 followed by an incubation in darkness for 10 min. DCMU was added to a final concentration of 10 μm just prior to measurement. The average Fo was calculated as the average signal after four measuring flashes from the dark-adapted sample. Samples were subjected to a 30-μs saturating actinic flash to give Fm followed by a series of 3-μs measuring flashes to follow F over a 1-s measurement period. The fluorescence signals were normalized as (F – Fo)/(Fm – Fo).Isolation of PSII—PSII preparations from the HT3 and ΔctpAHT3 strains were isolated according to Ref. 2Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar.Determination of Manganese Content—The concentrations of manganese were measured on an AA600 atomic absorption spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes samples were prepared as follows. Cells were harvested and washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA buffer according to Ref. 22Keren N. Kidd M.J. Penner-Hahn J.E. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15085-15092Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, resuspended in HCMS buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 m sucrose, pH 7.8) to a concentration of 500 μg of Chl/ml, and broken with 0.17-mm glass beads. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 3 min to remove the glass beads and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the cell membranes. The membranes were resuspended in HCMS buffer to ∼800 μg of Chl/ml. The membrane samples were diluted to 10 μg of Chl/ml in 80% nitric acid and allowed to digest overnight. The digested membranes were then diluted 1:2 in deionized water for metal analysis. PSII samples were diluted to 5 μg of Chl/ml in deionized water. The manganese:PSII ratio was calculated based on 41 molecules of Chl/PSII (2Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).Protein Detection—PSII samples (7 μg of Chl/lane) were fractionated using the SDS-PAGE system described in Ref. 2Kashino Y. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Wang Q. Whitmarsh J. Satoh K. Pakrasi H.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8004-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining (Sigma). Membrane samples (5 μg of Chl/lane) were fractionated using a 16% acrylamide, 6 m urea SDS-PAGE system. For immunodetection, fractionated proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the CP47, D1, D2, and PsbO proteins were identified using the corresponding specific antibodies. The hybridization signals were detected using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) and then visualized on a Fujifilm LAS-1000 plus imager (Fujifilm, Stamford, CT). PsbV (cytochrome c550) was detected based on heme staining using chemiluminescence reagents. The identity of the Psb27 band was confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis (see below).MALDI Mass Spectrometry—The protein band corresponding to Psb27 was excised from a Coomassie-stained gel, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min, alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min, and digested with trypsin at 37 °C for 12 h. The resulting peptide fragments were analyzed on a MALDI time-of-flight Voyager DE STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City). The Protein Prospector program was used to identify hits in the Synechocystis 6803 translated open reading frames data base (46Clauser K.R. Baker P.R. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar).Membrane Association of PSII Proteins—Membranes were partially solubilized as described in Ref. 23Qian M. Al-Khaldi S.F. Putnam-Evans C. Bricker T.M. Burnap R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15244-15252Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar with some modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA and broken with glass beads. The resulting cell lysate (∼300 μg of Chl/ml) was treated with 0.04% (w/v) of the detergent β-dodecyl maltoside (Amresco) and immediately centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 40 min to pellet the membranes. The supernatant fraction was carefully removed, and the membranes were suspended in HCMS buffer to 800 μg of Chl/ml. Supernatant and membranes samples were analyzed for PSII protein content. The ImageJ program was used to quantify the relative amounts of different proteins in the samples.RESULTSΔctpAHT3 Mutant Construction—To characterize the PSII complexes containing only the pD1 protein, we generated the double mutant ΔctpAHT3 in Synechocystis 6803, in which (a) the CP47 protein has a C-terminal histidine tag to facilitate PSII isolation (21Bricker T.M. Morvant J. Masri N. Sutton H.M. Frankel L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and (b) the ctpA gene is deleted resulting in the presence of pD1 in the PSII complex (13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8082-8086Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The ΔctpA construct used for this study differs from that described previously (13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The ΔctpA and ΔctpAHT3 mutants described in the present work contain a 1.5-kb erythromycin resistance marker at the ctpA locus (Fig. 1A). Complete segregation of the ΔctpA mutation was confirmed by PCR analysis of the ctpA locus (Fig. 1B). The presence of the C-terminal hexahistidine tag at the psbB locus was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (Fig. 1C). Because a low fluorescence phenotype has been observed for other D1 processing protease mutants (12Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol.

Fig. 1D shows that the ΔctpA and ΔctpAHT3 mutants have negligible Kautsky fluorescence induction curves compared with that of HT3 cells.Manganese Content of ΔctpAHT3 Membranes and Isolated PSII—Mutants containing a defective D1 processing protease have PSII complexes with no oxygen evolution activity specifically because of the absence of an active manganese cluster (12Diner B.A. Ries D.F. Cohen B.N. Metz J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8972-8980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Anbudurai P.R. Mor T.S. Ohad I. Shestakov S.V. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It was previously reported that membranes from the Scenedesmus LF1 mutant had a significant decrease in manganese content. Therefore, it was concluded that the assembly of a functional manganese cluster was not possible in D1 processing mutants, because only 2 of the 4 manganese atoms involved in oxygen evolution activity could bind to PSII (25Metz J.G. Wong J. Bishop N.I. FEBS Lett. 1980; 114: 61-66Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether the manganese content of membranes was representative of the manganese bound to PSII complexes.To resolve the issue of the number of manganese atoms associated with pD1-containing PSII, the manganese content of membranes and isolated PSII samples from HT3 and ΔctpAHT3 cells were measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Table I shows that the manganese content of ΔctpAHT3 membranes is indeed ∼50% that of HT3 membranes on a per chlorophyll basis. However, manganese measurements of isolated PSII complexes revealed a different interpretation of the ability of manganese to bind to pD1-containing PSII complexes. As expected, HT3 PSII complexes had a manganese:PSII of 4, but PSII complexes from the ΔctpAHT3 mutant were devoid of any manganese.Table IManganese content of membranes and purified PSII samplesMn/ChlMn/PSIInmol/molHT3 membranes32.3 ± 1.2 (n = 3) (100%)NDΔctpAHT3 membranes16.3 ± 2.5 (n = 3) (50.5%)NDHT3 PSII98.0 ± 4.8 (n = 4) (100%)4.0 ± 0.2 (n = 4)ΔctpAHT3 PSII1.0 ± 0.1 (n = 4) (1.1%)0.04 ± 0.01 (n = 4) Open table in a new tab Another widely used technique to examine the presence of a functional manganese cluster in PSII is to measure the decay of chlorophyll fluorescence after a single saturating flash in the presence of DCMU. Upon illumination, charge separation gives the high fluorescent state (Y +Z P680 Q –A), which decays over time as charge recombination occurs between Q –A and other electron acceptors within PSII. The presence of DCMU prevents normal Q –A to QB electron transfer. Thus, chlorophyll fluorescence decay in the presence of DCMU reflects charge recombination between Q –A and the donor side of PSII. In PSII complexes without a functional manganese cluster, charge recombination occurs between Q –A and Y +Z with a t½ ≥ 1 ms (26Diner B.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 337-360Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the addition of exogenous Mn2+ ions can block charge recombination between Q –A and Y +Z by donating electrons directly to Y +Z. The site at which this Mn2+ is bound and oxidized is predicted to be the first binding site during manganese cluster assembly, also referred to as the high affinity manganese binding site (9Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 27Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar).Exogenous Mn2+ ions block charge recombination between Q –A and Y +Z over a timescale of 1 s (27Nixon P.J. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). This property has been previously used to monitor the integrity of the high affinity manganese binding site in various D1 mutants (9Nixon P.J. Trost J.T.

Fig. 2 shows the charge recombination kinetics between Q –A and the donor side of ΔctpAHT3 PSII in the presence and absence of 1 mm MnCl2. In the absence of added Mn2+, the decay curve is characteristic of charge recombination between Q –A and Y +Z with a t½ of 20 ms. Similar decay curves and t½ values (10–20 ms) have been reported for the Scenedesmus LF-1 mutant and the Synechocystis D1 S345P and A344Stop mutants (9Nixon P.J. Trost J.T. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10859-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As evident from the lack of decay after 600 ms, the addition of exogenous Mn2+ ions blocks charge recombination between Q –A and Y +Z in ΔctpAHT3 PSII. The structure of the high affinity binding site is not significantly altered in the ΔctpAHT3 mutant, because Mn2+ ions could still access and reduce Y +Z.Fig. 2Charge recombination kinetics between Q–A and the donor side ofΔctpAHT3 PSII in the presence and absence of Mn2+. The charge recombination kinetics of isolated ΔctpAHT3 PSII complexes (2 μg of Chl/ml) were measured in the presence (solid) and absence (dashed) of 1 mm MnCl2 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The arrow indicates the saturating actinic flash.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These results suggest that manganese affinity to PSII is severely decreased in the absence of D1 processing. Because the manganese content of membranes from the ΔctpAHT3 mutant is ∼50% of that of HT3, it is possible that the PSII-associated manganese does not survive the PSII isolation procedure or that there is another protein(s) that bind manganese in the membrane. These data from isolated PSII complexes suggest that D1 cleavage is a requirement for the stable interaction of any of the four manganese atoms with PSII.ΔctpAHT3 PSII Complexes Lack the Extrinsic Proteins PsbO, PsbV, and PsbU—It has been reported previously that pD1 is incorporated into PSII complexes containing the membrane components D2, CP47, CP43, and cytochrome b559 (12Diner B.A. Ries D.F.

To identify new cycling proteins, we have developed a novel procedure for the purification of ERGIC membranes from HepG2 cells treated with brefeldin A, a drug known to accumulate cycling proteins in the ERGIC. Membranes enriched 110-fold over the homogenate for ERGIC-53 were obtained and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Major proteins corresponded to established and putative cargo receptors and components mediating protein maturation and membrane traffic. Among the uncharacterized proteins, a 32-kDa protein termed ERGIC-32 is a novel cycling membrane protein with sequence homology to Erv41p and Erv46p, two proteins enriched in COPII vesicles of yeast. ERGIC-32 localizes to the ERGIC and partially colocalizes with the human homologs of Erv41p and Erv46p, which mainly localize to the cis-Golgi. ERGIC-32 interacts with human Erv46 (hErv46) as revealed by covalent cross-linking and mistargeting experiments, and silencing of ERGIC-32 by small interfering RNAs increases the turnover of hErv46. We propose that ERGIC-32 functions as a modulator of the hErv41-hErv46 complex by stabilizing hErv46.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1541-1552PubMed Google Scholar). The ERGIC is the first anterograde/retrograde sorting station in the secretory pathway. Proteins cycling in the early secretory pathway are sorted in the ERGIC from secretory cargo with different efficiencies depending on the features and the expressed amounts of the individual proteins. ERGIC-53 is efficiently sorted into the retrograde pathway, and only a minor fraction escapes to the cis-Golgi (7Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar), whereas a larger fraction of the KDEL-R also cycles via the cis-Golgi (11Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1557-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). It appears unlikely that protein sorting is the only function of the ERGIC, but other presumed functions are less clear. The ERGIC appears to play some role in quality control of newly synthesized proteins as indicated by the presence of the KDEL-R, which cycles chaperones and folding enzymes to the ER that have inadvertently escaped from the ER. In general, only fully folded and oligomerized proteins are transport-competent and can leave the ER (23Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear, however, to what extent protein folding can also extend to the ERGIC in different cells (24Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 25Spiro M.J. Spiro R.G. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Yamamoto K.

Traffic. 2002; 3: 833-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ERGIC has also been postulated to be involved in retrotranslocation to the cytosol of permanently misfolded proteins (28Raposo G. van Santen H.M. Leijendekker R. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A particularly striking feature of the ERGIC is its resistance to the fungal metabolite brefeldin A. BFA blocks ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) in an inactive GDP-bound conformation and thereby prevents binding of COPI coats to ERGIC and Golgi membranes (29Chardin P. McCormick F.

Upon BFA treatment the Golgi rapidly tubulates and fuses with the ER by an energy-, temperature-, and microtubule-dependant process (31Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

Based on these observations it may be speculated that the purification of the ERGIC from cells treated with BFA could lead to the identification of novel cycling proteins and thereby provide new insight into the functions of this compartment as well as ER to Golgi transport. Here we describe a new procedure to highly purify ERGIC membranes from BFA-treated HepG2 cells and to identify major ERGIC proteins by mass spectrometry. Among novel cycling proteins we have characterized ERGIC-32, a new ERGIC protein that interacts with human Erv46, a protein previously characterized in yeast and functioning in ER to Golgi protein trafficking.

Alexa 488-, Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, NL)-, Cy5-, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc.) were used as secondary antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies against ERGIC-32 were produced by immunizing rabbits with a recombinant peptide encompassing amino acids 45–200 of the luminal domain of ERGIC-32 fused to GST. The recombinant hybrid protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The antiserum was affinity-purified by sequential adsorption to nitrocellulose-immobilized GST and GST-ERGIC-32 followed by acid elution. Cells—HepG2 and HeLa cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml fungizone (Sigma). Cells were transfected with FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent according to the supplier's recommendations (Roche Diagnostics). Stable cell lines were obtained by selection with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Expression of human Erv41 (hErv41)-Myc was induced by incubation for 16 h with 10 mm butyric acid (Sigma). Purification of ERGIC Membranes—Subcellular fractionation (Fig. 1A) was performed essentially according to Klumperman et al. (7Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar) using Nycodenz gradients (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). 5 days postconfluent HepG2 cells (one 150-mm diameter dish/gradient) were treated with 10 μg/ml brefeldin A (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI) for 90 min and rinsed with 150 mm NaCl and homogenization buffer (buffer H: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). Cells were homogenized in buffer H supplemented with 40 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) using a ball-bearing homogenizer (45Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). A postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant (2 mg of proteins) was loaded on top of a linear 13–29% Nycodenz gradient with a 35% cushion. Nycodenz solutions contained 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, with the exception of the 13% solution that contained additional 120 mm NaCl. After centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 3 h, fractions of 1.2 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube. Fractions 9–12, which are specifically enriched in ERGIC-53 and KDEL-R, were pooled and diluted five times with Nycodenz buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma). Prewashed M-450 Dynabeads coupled to goat anti-mouse IgG (Dynal Biotech GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) were incubated overnight with the mAb against KDEL-R in PBS, 0.1% BSA and washed four times with this buffer and once with Nycodenz buffer, 0.1% BSA. 1 ml of diluted membranes was incubated with 0.2 ml of the anti-KDEL-R magnetic beads for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle end-over-end mixing in the presence of protease inhibitors. Beads and membranes were washed four times with PBS, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm EDTA and twice with PBS, 1 mm EDTA. 30 separate immunopurification reactions were carried out in parallel. The washed beads were pooled and treated with 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 11.5, for 30 min on ice. Membranes were recovered in the supernatant after this treatment and pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membranes were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer containing 6.5 mm iodoacetamide (Sigma) and loaded on a 6–12% SDS gel. Protein was determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). Markers of the different organelles were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified with ChemImager™ (Alpha Inotech Corp.). Mass Spectrometry—Slices of silver-stained gels (46Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7853) Google Scholar) were washed five times (1 min each) with 30 μl of 40% n-propanol followed by five washes with 30 μl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 containing 50% acetonitrile. The gel slices were dried in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant, Farmingdale, NY) and reswelled in 0.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade-modified trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI) in 10 μl of 100 mm NH4HCO3. Enough digestion buffer (100 mm NH4HCO3) was added to completely immerse the gel slices in the liquid. Digestion was at 37 °C overnight. The supernatant was collected, and the gel slices were extracted with 15 μl of 0.1% formic acid for 5 min followed by 15 μl of acetonitrile for 1 min. Extraction was repeated twice, and all supernatants were pooled and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. For mass spectral analysis, the peptides were redissolved in 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 5 μl was used for identification by liquid chromatography MS/MS. The peptides were separated on fused silica capillaries (100 μm inner diameter × 280 μm outer diameter, LC-Packings) packed with POROS R2 material with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% methanol in 0.02% acetic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Mass spectral data were acquired on a TSQ7000 triple quadrupole instrument (Finnigan, San José, CA), with data-controlled switching between precursor ions and daughter ions during single chromatographic runs. The daughter ion spectra were used to identify the proteins with the Mascot search software (www.matrixscience.com). Recombinant DNA—The cDNA clone HF00712 (47Hirosawa M. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Kikuno R. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) corresponding to the gene KIAA1181 and encoding ERGIC-32 was cloned by the HUGE (human unidentified gene encoded) project and kindly provided by the Kasuza DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). This cDNA contains a 5′-untranslated region. No EST with an initiation codon upstream of the first one found in this cDNA clone was identified in the NCBI databases. hErv41 (NCBI accession number gi|7706105|), hErv46 (gi|4929577|), Surf-4 (gi|12644052|), and hYif1p (gi|12654907|) were cloned by RT-PCR using different sets of specific primers: 5′-GCG GTA CCC CTG AAG ATG AGG CGA CTG AAT C-3′ and 5′-CGT CTA GAC TTC AAT CGG GAG GTG TTA ATG TG-3′ for hErv41, 5′-CGA ATT CCC TTT CCG GCC GGT CCC CAT G-3′ and 5′-CGT CTA GAC CGA GGG TGA CTA CGT TGT CTT CC-3′ for hErv46, 5′-CGA ATT CCA CCA TGG CTT ATC ACT CGG GCT ACG GA-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAT GGG GCC AGG GGG TCA CC-3′ for hYif1p, and 5′-CGA ATT CCA CCA TGG GCC AGA ACG ACC TGA TG-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAA CCA GTC CTT GAC GGC CAC GG-3′ for Surf-4. Total RNAs were prepared from HepG2 cells using the Peq-gold RNA pure kit (Peqlab Biotechnology GmbH, Herlangen, Germany). cDNAs were amplified with the Omniscript™ kit (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). RT-PCR-specific products were cloned and sequenced. HA- and Myc-tagged versions of ERGIC-32, hErv41, and hErv46 were obtained by PCR, cloned, and analyzed for correct sequence. All constructs were cloned into pcDNA3 vector except GST-ERGIC-32, which was cloned into pGEX-5X2. Metabolic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, Endoglycosidase Digestion, and Cross-linking—Cells grown in 3.5-cm dishes were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine, and ERGIC-32 was immunoprecipitated (48Schindler R. Itin C. Zerial M. Lottspeich F. Hauri H.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) with anti-ERGIC-32 or mAb 12CA5 against the HA epitope. Endoglycosidase digestions of the immunoprecipitates were done as described (49Kappeler F. Klopfenstein D.R. Foguet M. Paccaud J.P. Hauri H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31801-31808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Membranes were cross-linked for 30 min in 1 mm DSP (Sigma) dissolved in 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.4, 250 mm surcrose, 2 mm CaCl2. The cross-linker was quenched with 10 mm ethanolamine. The membranes were then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl) containing 20 mm iodoacetamide. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown in 8-well multichamber glass slides (Miles Laboratories, Naperville, IL) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS, and processed for double immunofluorescence microscopy (5Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an acidified ethanol fixation/permeabilization procedure was used for anti-ERGIC-32. Cells were washed in cold PBS, dehydrated in 95% ethanol, 5% acetic acid at -20 °C for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and processed for immunofluorescence in 1% BSA containing PBS. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy pictures were acquired with a TCS NT microscope (Leika). To determine the topology of ERGIC-32, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde on ice, and the plasma membrane was permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) for 5 min on ice and washed with PBS. The cells were then further permeabilized or not with 0.1% saponin and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence was recorded with a Zeiss Axiovert 135M microscope coupled to a charge-coupled device camera. RNA Interference—ERGIC-32 gene expression was silenced using synthesized small interfering RNA duplexes (Eurogentech, Liege, Belgium). The targeted sequences of ERGIC-32 were AACGAGCTCTATGTCGATGAC and AATACGTCGCCTACAGCCACA for si1 and si2, respectively. Their specificity for the ERGIC-32 mRNA was confirmed by a BLASTn search in NCBInr database. Similarly the oligonucleotide AGCAGGGAATTTTCACATA was designed to interfere specifically with hErv41 gene expression. As a negative control, we used the oligonucleotide AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT, which gives no significant match in a BLASTn search (human NCBInr database). Oligonucleotides were transfected into HeLa cells with RNAifect (Qiagen) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. In typical experiments, 50–80% confluent cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with 5 μg of duplex siRNA and 20 μl of RNAifect/well. 48 h later the cells were trypsinized and seeded into a fresh well before a new round of transfection. 48 h after the second transfection, the cells were subcultured for subsequent experiments. Purification of ERGIC Membranes from BFA-treated Cells— To identify new cycling proteins in the early secretory pathway, we developed a procedure for the purification of ERGIC membranes from HepG2 cells treated with BFA. The rationale of using BFA is 2-fold. BFA leads to an accumulation of rapidly cycling proteins in the ERGIC, as exemplified by ERGIC-53 and KDEL-R, and to the fusion of the Golgi apparatus with the ER. The latter effect facilitates the purification of ERGIC membranes which, in the absence of BFA, largely cofractionate with trans-Golgi membranes on density gradients (7Klumperman J. Schweizer A. Clausen H. Tang B.L. Hong W. Oorschot V. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3411-3425PubMed Google Scholar). In a first step, a postnuclear supernatant of BFA-treated HepG2 cells was separated by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane distributed to the bottom fractions of the Nycodenz gradient, whereas ERGIC membranes, identified by ERGIC-53 and KDEL-R, floated to the top fractions (Fig. 1A; also see supplementary Fig. 1). The ERGIC-containing top fractions were still contaminated by endosomes (transferrin receptor, not shown), lysosomes (LAMP-1), trans-Golgi network (TGN46), and some ER (BAP31) (Fig. 1B, lane T). In a second step, these contaminating membranes were removed by immunopurification. The pooled top fractions were incubated with magnetic beads to which an antibody against a cytoplasmically exposed epitope of the KDEL-R was coupled (Fig. 1). The resulting membrane fraction was devoid of detectable transferrin receptor, LAMP-1, TGN46, and BAP31 but contained some antibodies that had leaked from the immunobeads. The immunopurified membranes were then subjected to the classical carbonate, pH 11.5, treatment to remove the antibodies as well as peripheral proteins. The final ERGIC fraction was 110 ± 19.5-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) enriched over the homogenate. Proteomics of ERGIC Membranes—To determine the protein composition of the purified ERGIC membrane fraction we scaled-up the purification and separated the proteins by 6–12% SDS-PAGE. One-dimensional instead of two-dimensional gels were used because of the unresolved difficulty of solubilizing membrane proteins by isoelectric focusing (50Santoni V. Molloy M. Rabilloud T. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 1054-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). 30 bands in a molecular mass range of 20 to more than 300 kDa were reproducibly detected on silver-stained gels (Fig. 2). Bands were excised, trypsin-digested in gel, and analyzed in parallel by MALDI-TOF MS and nano-electrospray tandem mass spectroscopy techniques. 19 proteins were unambiguously identified by screening NCBInr databases. Several proteins were identified with both techniques, whereas some could only be detected with one. A refinement of the gel analysis using SDS gels containing urea, to better solubilize membrane proteins and resolve low molecular weight proteins, led to the identification of five more proteins, bringing the total number to 24 identified proteins (Table I).Table IProteomic analysis of the ERGIC For each identified protein, the percentage of total protein coverage (MALDI-TOF) or the number of identified peptides (MS/MS) is indicated.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was shown previously to induce expression of Mn-SOD in endothelial cells by a NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. The goal of the current study was to determine the transcriptional mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. VEGF resulted in protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of IκB and subsequent translocation of p65 NF-κB into the nucleus. Overexpression of constitutively active IκB blocked VEGF stimulation of Mn-SOD. In transient transfection assays, VEGF increased Mn-SOD promoter activity, an effect that was dependent on a second intronic NF-κB consensus motif. In contrast, VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD was enhanced by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and by dominant negative Akt and was decreased by constitutively active Akt. Overexpression of a constitutively active (phosphorylation-resistant) form of FKHRL1 (TMFKHRL1) resulted in increased Mn-SOD expression, suggesting that the negative effect of PI3K-Akt involves attenuation of forkhead activity. In co-transfection assays, the Mn-SOD promoter was transactivated by TMFKHRL1. Flavoenzyme inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), and antisense oligonucleotides against p47phox (AS-p47phox) inhibited VEGF stimulation of IκB/NF-κB and forkhead phosphorylation, supporting a role for NADPH oxidase activity in both signaling pathways. Like VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activated the PI3K-Akt-forkhead pathway. However, HGF-PI3K-Aktforkhead signaling was insensitive to diphenyleneiodonium and AS-p47phox. Moreover, HGF failed to induce phosphorylation of IκB/NF-κB or nuclear translocation of NF-κB and had no effect on Mn-SOD expression. Together, these data suggest that VEGF is uniquely coupled to Mn-SOD expression through growth factor-specific reactive oxygen species (ROS)-sensitive positive (protein kinase C-NF-κB) and negative (PI3K-Akt-forkhead) signaling pathways.

Science. 2003; 301: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition to its mitogenic and chemotactic effects, VEGF also acts to promote endothelial cell survival (4Alon T. Hemo I. Itin A. Pe'er J. Stone J. Keshet E. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The VEGF family of proteins binds to three receptor-type tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGF receptor-1), KDR/Flk-1 (VEGF receptor-2), and VEGFR-3. VEGFR-1 and -2 are normally expressed in vascular endothelial cells, whereas VEGFR-3 is expressed in the lymphatic endothelium. Of the VEGF receptors, KDR/Flk-1 is believed to play the most important role in mediating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and permeability. VEGF has been shown to activate a number of different intracellular signaling pathways, including PKC, PI3K and Akt, MEK1/2, p38 MAPK, and phospholipase Cγ (5Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y.

VEGF may alter endothelial cell phenotype through transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional mechanisms. Among the transcription factors that have been implicated in VEGF signaling are NF-κB, Egr-1, NFAT-1, Ets-1, and Stat-3/5 (10Chen Z. Fisher R.J. Riggs C.W. Rhim J.S. Lautenberger J.A.

More recently, we reported that VEGF results in PI3K-Akt-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the forkhead family of proteins (15Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C.

In previous studies, we provided evidence for a link between VEGF signaling and the redox state of the cell (16Abid M.R. Kachra Z. Spokes K.C. Aird W.C.

Specifically, we demonstrated that VEGF induces the activity of NADPH oxidase and that NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) are, in turn, required for VEGF-mediated induction of cell migration, proliferation, and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) expression. Subsequent studies have confirmed the importance of ROS in VEGF signal transduction (18Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol.

By converting superoxide (O2˙¯) to H2O2 and O2, these enzymes inhibit free radical reactions that lead to oxidative damage. Mn-SOD is encoded by the nuclear SOD2 gene and is localized in mitochondria, the major site for oxidative phosphorylation. ROS have been shown to induce mitochondrial damage and dysfunction, leading to an impaired Krebs' cycle and induction of apoptotic pathways (for review, see Refs. 20Taniyama Y. Griendling K.K.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Its importance in homeostasis is evidenced by the lethal cardiomyopathy that develops in neonatal mice that are null for Mn-SOD (23Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L.

In the present study, we wished to extend our previous findings by elucidating the mechanisms underlying VEGF stimulation of Mn-SOD. We show that the effect of VEGF on Mn-SOD expression involves a negative PI3K-Akt-forkhead pathway and a positive PKC-NF-κB pathway, both of which are sensitive to NADPH oxidase activity. The presence of two opposing pathways, one negative and the other positive, is likely to render the VEGF-Mn-SOD axis highly modulatable by the extracellular environment. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown in endothelial growth medium-2-MV (EGM-2-MV) BulletKit (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Endothelial cells from passage 3-6 were used for all experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum prior to treatment with 50 ng/ml human VEGF165 or 40 units/ml hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) (Pepro Tech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Where indicated, cells were preincubated for 30 min with 50 μm LY294002, 1 μm GF109203X, 50 μm PD98059, or 10 μm diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Western and Northern Blot Analyses—Endothelial cells were harvested for total protein, and Western blots were carried out as described previously (15Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The following phospho-specific antibodies were used: Ser-256 FKHR, Ser-473 Akt, ERK1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), IκB, NF-κB, and CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); antiphospho-Tyr 4G10 from UBI (Waltham, MA); and anti-β-actin from Sigma. Anti-ERK1/2, anti-Akt, anti-FKHR, anti-IκB, anti-NF-κB (p65), and anti-CREB/activating transcription factor (ATF) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. RNA extraction and Northern blot assays were performed as described previously (17Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization Studies—HCAEC were plated onto 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Christchurch, New Zealand) at a density of 30,000 cells/well. The cells were grown in EGM-2-MV for 48 h and were fixed in ice-cold 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently incubated with primary anti-p65 antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h. Following extensive washes in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. Following additional phosphate-buffered saline washes, the slides were mounted in Aquamount (Vector, Burlingame, CA) and viewed under confocal fluorescence microscopy. To-Pro (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for identification of nuclear co-localization. Adenoviruses—HCAEC were infected with adenoviruses encoding the cDNAs of β-galactosidase (Adv), dominant negative T308A/S473A-Akt (DN-Akt), constitutively active Gag-Akt (CA-Akt), wild type (WT)FKHRL1, and triple mutant (TM)-FKHRL1 as described previously (15Abid M.R.

The Akt viruses were a generous gift from Koji Ueki (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). The triple mutant version of FKHRL1 contains T32A, S253A, and S315A and is resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation. WT- and DN-PKC viruses (a generous gift from George King, Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School) were used as described previously (27Minami T. Abid M.R. Zhang J. King G. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6976-6984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Adenovirus expressing degradation-resistant constitutively active IκBα (IκB S32A/S36A) was a generous gift from Kaikobad Irani (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) (28Deshpande S.S. Angkeow P. Huang J. Ozaki M. Irani K. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Co-transfection Assays—Control vector (pECE) and vector expressing FKHRL1 (pECE-FKHRL1) were provided by Michael Greenberg, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA. The pGL3-based construct containing a 3340-bp promoter of human Mn-SOD (pGL3-Mn-Luc) was a generous gift from Moon Yim (Laboratory of Biochemistry, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). A 369-bp fragment (from nucleotide 2410 to nucleotide 2778) of the second intron of Mn-SOD containing the putative NF-κB, C/EBP, and NF-1 consensus sites was generated by PCR using human genomic DNA as template (the sense primer, 5′-TCTTGTCGACCGTTAGTGGTTTGCACAAGGAAGATAATCG-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-AATAGTCGACTTCACAACTGGGGTATTCCCCAGTCTCTCC-3′, with the SalI site underlined). The resulting fragment was digested with SalI and inserted into the SalI site of the pGL3-Mn-Luc plasmid in forward and reverse orientations, giving rise to pGL3-Mn2-Luc and pGL3-Mn2R-Luc, respectively. To generate the NF-κB mutation (pGL3-Mn2(mt-NFκB)-Luc), a 369-bp fragment was regenerated with the same forward primer as above but with a reverse primer containing the mutations (in lowercase letters) 5′-AATAGTCGACTTCACAACTGGtGTATTttCCAGTCTCTCC-3′. A mutation in the C/EBP site (pGL3-Mn2(mt-CEBP)-Luc) was obtained using a two-step mutagenesis protocol with the primers 5′-GATTAAAAGAGGAGGAAGTTAttACATTCTGGAAGATTTAC-3′ and 5′-GTAAATCTTCCAGAATGTaaTAACTTCCTCCTCTTTTAATC-3′ (mutations in lowercase letters). A total of 0.05 pmol of the Mn-SOD reporter plasmid, 50 ng of a control plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (pRL-CMV), and 0.075 pmol of the forkhead expression vector (or control vector, pECE) were incubated with 2 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four h later, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 12 h in EBM plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of VEGF for 6 h, at which time they were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Experiments were performed in triplicates and repeated at least three times. Transfection with Antisense Oligonucleotide p47phox—HCAEC were grown to 70-80% confluency in 10-cm plates and transfected with 200 nm phosphorothioate antisense p47phox oligonucleotide in Opti-MEM containing Lipofectin (10 μg/ml) for 4 h. The cells were then incubated in EGM-2 for 24 h and serum-starved in 0.5% serum for 12-16 h before VEGF treatment for the times indicated. The antisense sequence (5′-TTTGTCTGGTTGTGTGTGGG-3′) was complementary to nucleotides 394-413 of human p47phox mRNA (29Bey E.A. Cathcart M.K. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was phosphorothioate-modified and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (Sequitur, Natick, MA). Assay for NADPH Oxidase Activity in HCAEC and HUVEC—The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by a cell scraper, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer containing 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 1× protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma), 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. NADPH oxidase activity of the cell lysate was measured using a modified assay as described previously (30Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2359) Google Scholar). Briefly, photon emission from the chromogenic substrate lucigenin as a function of acceptance of electron/O2˙¯ generated by the NADPH oxidase complex was measured every 15 s for 20 min in a Berthold luminometer. NADPH oxidase assay buffer containing 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4 (7H2O), 1.75 mm CaCl2 (2H2O), 11 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADH, and 5 μm lucigenin was used. The data were transformed to relative light units/min/mg of protein using a standard curve generated with xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Measurement of Intracellular ROS Generation—The changes in intracellular ROS levels were determined by measuring the oxidative conversion of cell-permeable 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA; Molecular Probes Inc.) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis as described previously (17Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). VEGF-mediated Induction of Mn-SOD Is Attenuated by the PI3K-Akt-Forkhead Signaling Pathway—Previous studies in non-endothelial cells have demonstrated that insulin inhibits Mn-SOD expression via a PI3K-Akt-forkhead-dependent pathway (31Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that VEGF, although capable of inducing phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of forkhead in endothelial cells in a PI3K-Akt-dependent manner (15Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), results in a net increase in Mn-SOD mRNA and protein levels (17Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Together, these findings suggest that VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD involves an interplay between positive and negative pathways. To test this hypothesis, HCAEC and HUVEC were preincubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm), treated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 4 h, and then processed for Northern blot analysis of Mn-SOD. Inhibition of PI3K increased basal and VEGF-induced Mn-SOD expression in both types of endothelial cells (Fig. 1A shows the effect of LY294002 in HCAEC). Lower doses of LY294002 (0.1-10 μm) blocked VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and enhanced VEGF stimulation of Mn-SOD expression without altering basal Mn-SOD levels (Fig. 1B). Together, these findings strongly suggest that PI3K plays a negative role in the VEGF-Mn-SOD signaling pathway. To determine whether PI3K exerts its negative effect on Mn-SOD expression through Akt, a serine-threonine kinase downstream of PI3K, HCAEC and HUVEC were infected with adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase, CA-Akt, or DN-Akt and were incubated in the absence or presence of VEGF. Overexpression of DN-Akt accentuated the effect of VEGF on Mn-SOD expression, whereas CA-Akt had the opposite effect (Fig. 1C shows HCAEC). Together, these findings suggest that PI3K-Akt attenuates VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD in endothelial cells. Previous studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and mice have implicated the daf-2/insulin-forkhead signaling pathway in regulating Mn-SOD expression (32Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 33Yanase S. Yasuda K. Ishii N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The human Mn-SOD gene contains two forkhead consensus sites in the upstream promoter region, one at -1249 (GTAAACAA; inverse of TTGTTTAC) and another at -997 (TTGTTTAA) (31Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). In non-endothelial cells, insulin has been shown to induce PI3K-Akt-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of FKHRL1 and to inhibit Mn-SOD expression (31Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medema R.H. Burgering B.M. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). To determine whether Mn-SOD lies downstream of VEGF-PI3K-Akt-forkhead in endothelial cells, HCAEC and HUVEC were infected with adenoviruses overexpressing β-galactosidase, WT-FKHRL1, or a constitutively activated phosphorylation-resistant TM-FKHRL1. The overexpressing cells were serum-starved and then treated in the presence or absence of VEGF for 4 h. VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD was accentuated by overexpression of TM-FKHRL1 but not Adv or WT-FKHRL1 (Fig. 1D shows HCAEC). In the absence of VEGF treatment, TM-FKHRL1 alone had no effect on Mn-SOD expression in serum-starved cells (Fig. 1D). However, in the presence of serum-rich medium, TM-FKHRL1-infected cells demonstrated increased Mn-SOD mRNA levels (Fig. 1E). Together, these data suggest that forkhead-mediated induction of Mn-SOD is dependent on VEGF- or serum-mediated activation of positive pathway(s). In co-transfection assays, the overexpression of TM-FKHRL1 resulted in a 6.6 ± 0.3-fold induction of the 3340-bp human Mn-SOD promoter (Fig. 1F). These findings support the conclusion that the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway negatively regulates expression of Mn-SOD via phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of forkhead. VEGF-mediated Induction of Mn-SOD Is Positively Regulated through PKC and IκB/NF-κB—Although VEGF triggers a negative PI3K-Akt-forkhead signaling pathway, VEGF signaling results in the net induction of Mn-SOD mRNA and protein. To identify the positive pathway(s) responsible for this effect, endothelial cells were preincubated with other inhibitors of signaling and then treated in the absence or presence of VEGF. As shown in Fig. 2A, preincubation of endothelial cells with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (1 μm) resulted in marked inhibition of VEGF induction of Mn-SOD, whereas the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) had no such effect. To determine which PKC isoforms are involved in mediating the VEGF response, HCAEC were infected with either WT or DN isoforms of PKC and treated in the absence or presence of VEGF. VEGF induction of Mn-SOD was completely abrogated by DN-PKCδ, significantly inhibited by DN-PKCζ (Fig. 2B), and unchanged by DN-PKCα or DN-PKCϵ (data not shown). These findings suggest that VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD is dependent on novel and atypical PKC isoforms. Previous studies have demonstrated a link between PKCδ/ζ signaling and NF-κB activity in endothelial cells (27Minami T. Abid M.R. Zhang J. King G. Kodama T. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6976-6984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 34Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3917-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 36Rogers R.J. Chesrown S.E. Kuo S. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. Biochem.

Consistent with this hypothesis, VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD was blocked by overexpression of a constitutively active, phosphorylation/ubiquitination-resistant form of IκB (Fig. 2, B and C). Previous studies have pointed to the importance of an NF-κB consensus element in the second intron (at +2758 nucleotides, relative to the start site of the second intron). In transient transfection assays, VEGF induced Mn-SOD promoter activity in the presence, but not the absence, of the second intronic sequence (Fig. 2D). Mutation of the NF-κB motif (mt-NF-κB) resulted in a loss of induction, whereas mutation of the C/EBP site (at +2648 nucleotides; mt-CEBP) had no such effect (Fig. 2E). The transcription factor NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB. NF-κB activation requires phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination and degradation of cytoplasmic IκB, with subsequent release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Incubation of HCAEC with VEGF resulted in increased phosphorylation of IκB in the cytoplasm at 15 min and decreased total cytoplasmic IκB at 30 and 60 min (Fig. 3A). Moreover, VEGF promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB at 15 and 30 min (Fig. 3B). Preincubation with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of IκB (Fig. 3C) and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 3D). In immunofluorescent assays, VEGF induced the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB, an effect that was similarly blocked by GF109203X (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results suggest that VEGF-mediated induction of Mn-SOD is dependent on a PKC-NF-κB signaling pathway.Fig. 4VEGF induces nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB in"
https://openalex.org/W2044820772,"The relative importance of each core lipid in the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) has been of interest over the past decade. The isolation of genes encoding diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) and acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACAT1 and ACAT2) provided the opportunity to investigate the effects of isolated increases in triglycerides (TG) or cholesteryl esters (CE) on apolipoprotein B (apoB) lipoprotein biogenesis. Overexpression of human DGAT1 in rat hepatoma McA-RH7777 cells resulted in increased synthesis, cellular accumulation, and secretion of TG. These effects were associated with decreased intracellular degradation and increased secretion of newly synthesized apoB as VLDL. Similarly, overexpression of human ACAT1 or ACAT2 in McA-RH7777 cells resulted in increased synthesis, cellular accumulation, and secretion of CE. This led to decreased intracellular degradation and increased secretion of VLDL apoB. Overexpression of ACAT2 had a significantly greater impact upon assembly and secretion of VLDL from liver cells than did overexpression of ACAT1. The addition of oleic acid (OA) to media resulted in a further increase in VLDL secretion from cells expressing DGAT1, ACAT1, or ACAT2. VLDL secreted from DGAT1-expressing cells incubated in OA had a higher TG:CE ratio than VLDL secreted from ACAT1- and ACAT2-expressing cells treated with OA. These studies indicate that increasing DGAT1, ACAT1, or ACAT2 expression in McA-RH7777 cells stimulates the assembly and secretion of VLDL from liver cells and that the core composition of the secreted VLDL reflects the enzymatic activity that is elevated.

Stimulation of the secretion of apoB-lipoproteins by oleic acid (OA) is closely associated with increased TG synthesis and secretion, whereas decreased apoB-lipoprotein secretion in the presence of triacin D (a potent inhibitor of fatty acyl CoA synthetase) is associated with decreased TG synthesis (11Wu X. Sakata N. Dixon J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1200-1210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is a microsomal enzyme activity that catalyzes the final committed step in TG synthesis by using diacyl glycerol and fatty acyl CoA as its substrates (14Buhman K.K. Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40369-40372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). DGAT activity is present in the liver and, therefore, is likely to be involved in apoB-lipoprotein assembly and in the regulation of plasma TG concentrations (10Zhu D. Ganji S.H. Kamanna V.S.

Wilcox L.J. Huff M.W. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 286: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferases (ACATs) catalyze the formation of CE from cholesterol and long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (14Buhman K.K. Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol.

Similarly, obviation of the major alternate pathway of TG synthesis encoded by the DGAT2 gene significantly reduced but did not eliminate lipoprotein secretion by the liver or intestine (37Stone S.J.

Thus, the role of DGAT in the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins remains unclear. Two genes encoding human ACAT (ACAT1, ACAT2) have also been identified (38Oelkers P. Behari A.

Targeted deletion of the murine ACAT1 gene has no apparent consequences with regard to serum lipids, whereas deletion of the murine ACAT2 gene results in resistance to hyperlipidemia induced by a diet high in fat and cholesterol, suggesting a role for ACAT2 in the incorporation of dietary cholesterol and fat into intestinal lipoproteins (45Buhman K.K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Turley S. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Conversely, on the background of an apolipoprotein E-deficient animal, ACAT2 mutant mice secreted increased numbers of triglyceride-enriched VLDL that were severely depleted in CE (46Willner E.L. Tow B. Buhman K.K. Wilson M. Sanan D.A. Rudel L.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1262-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This suggests a major role of ACAT2 in loading lipoprotein particles with steryl esters but no direct role in VLDL biogenesis. In the present studies, we overexpressed human DGAT1, ACAT1, and ACAT2 individually in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells to investigate the effects of isolated increases in TG or CE synthesis on the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. We found that not only did overexpression of each of the three cDNAs increase secretion of apoB in VLDL but that the core lipid content of VLDL reflected the enzyme that was overexpressed. We also observed that the ACAT2 enzyme was more efficient in its promotion of lipoprotein biogenesis than was ACAT1, despite similar elevations in CE biosynthesis. Materials—N-Acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, dimethyl sulfoxide, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) were purchased from Sigma. Sheep anti-human apoB100 polyclonal antibodies were from Roche Applied Science or Calbiochem. They cross-react with mouse and rat apoB. [3H]glycerol and [35S]methionine/cysteine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Biosciences. Minimum essential medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) and OA were purchased from Sigma O-Acyltransferase Expression Constructs—Human DGAT1 and ACAT2 cDNAs were expressed from the cytomegalovirus promoter of pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) with ∼25 bp of 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (38Oelkers P. Behari A. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). ACAT1 was isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from mRNA extracted from the human macrophage cell line THP1, using oligonucleotides ACAT4 and ACAT5 (5′-TGTGGAGAAGCCTATTAGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-ATCTGTAAAGCCTGGAGTGGTCC-3′, respectively) to include 250 and 642 bp of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. This was performed to maximize levels of sterol esterification from ACAT1, which was demonstrated in pilot cell culture experiments to require more upstream sequences than for the other genes. Stable Transfected Cells—McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells, obtained from ATCC, were grown in 6-well plates coated with collagen and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 10% fetal bovine, and 10% horse serum (Invitrogen). Stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells expressing human DGAT1, ACAT1, and ACAT2 were generated by cotransfection of DGAT1 or ACAT plasmids with a neomycin vector and LipofectAMINE 2000. Positive clones were isolated using G418 selection media. A total of six DGAT1 clones, four ACAT1 clones, four ACAT2 clones, and five neomycin vector control clones were isolated. These clones were maintained in culture medium containing 400 μg/ml G418, which was removed prior to the experiments. Expression of human ACAT1, ACAT2, or DGAT1 in the individual clones was assessed by gene-specific reverse transcription-PCR assays from oligo(dT)-primed cDNA as described previously (38Oelkers P.

In vitro microsomal and cell culture O-acyltransferase enzymatic activities were determined as described (38Oelkers P. Behari A. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

Immunoprecipitation—For steady state studies, cells were preincubated in methionine-free medium for 2 h and then labeled with [35S]Met for 2 h. Studies of intracellular degradation of apoB in McA-RH7777 cells transfected with DGAT1, ACAT1, ACAT2, or vector control (Neo) involved preincubation in serum-free, methionine-free medium for 2 h, pulse labeling with [35S]Met for 30 min, and a 90-min chase protocol in medium supplemented with cold methionine. Samples were taken every 15 min and processed for intracellular apoB by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE as below. After labeling, media were transferred to tubes containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (30 μl/ml protease inhibitors, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm EDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0) and 0.86 mm freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were harvested with homogenization buffer (62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation of apoB100 in medium or cellular lysate was carried out according to the method of Dixon et al. (9Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose CL4B was added to the reaction solution to precipitate apoB100, which was released with sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) by boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was treated with Autofluor (National Diagnostic, Atlanta, GA) and, after drying, exposed to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR) at –70 °C and quantified using laser scanning densitometry. Metabolic Labeling, Lipid Extraction, and Thin Layer Chromatography—McA-RH7777 cells were labeled with [3H]glycerol (20 μCi/ml) or [3H]OA (15 μCi/ml) for 4 h. Labeled cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted with hexane/isopropanol (3/2, v/v) (1.5–2 ml/well) at room temperature for 2 h (48Pan M. Liang Js J.S. Fisher E.A. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4413-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The extraction solution was collected, and the remaining cellular proteins were lysed with 0.1 n NaOH. The media were extracted with 20 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2/1, v/v) at room temperature for 2 h. Then 5 volumes of H2O were added to the mixture, which was spun for 5 min at 2,000 rpm. The lower organic phase was carefully transferred to a new tube and dried under a stream of N2 gas. The lipid content of the cells and/or the media was resuspended in a small volume of hexane and applied to a plastic thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in hexane:ethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (70/30/1, v/v/v). The lipid spots were visualized with iodine vapor and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Statistical significance was assessed by students two tailed t test or analysis of variance. Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of apoB-containing lipoproteins was conducted as described by Boren et al. (49Boren J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sucrose gradient was formed by layering from the bottom of the tube: 2 ml of 47% sucrose, 2 ml of 25% sucrose, 5 ml of sample in 12.5% sucrose, and 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. All solutions contained 0.1 mm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 0.86 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μm N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal, 5 μm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The gradients were spun at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 65 h at 12 °C and unloaded into 12 fractions from the top of the tube. Each fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation of apoB, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography as described above. Cellular TG, CE, and Protein Mass Determination—TG mass in cell extracts was determined using a triglyceride determination kit from Roche Applied Science. CE mass in cell extracts was determined using an enzymatic assay after separation of free and esterified cholesterol by gas chromatography. Cellular protein levels were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Medium Lipoprotein Lipid Composition—Serum-free culture medium was collected after 6-h incubations of cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The culture medium was adjusted with solid NaCl to d = 1.006 and centrifuged for 22 h at 39,000 rpm in a 50.3 rotor. VLDL (d<1.006 lipoproteins) were isolated from the top 1 ml, and material from several wells was pooled and analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography (50Homan R. Anderson M.K. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 1998; 708: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Fraction densities were determined by the conventional assessment of refractive index using a refractometer. The VLDL fraction (3 ml) was extracted (51Slayback J.R. Cheung L.W. Geyer R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and after the addition of internal standard (4 μg, 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol) and 2 ml of acetone (with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene), it was heated in a culture tube with a Teflon-lined cap at 90° for 30 min. Ethyl acetate (6 ml) was added, and the mixture was heated again at 90° for 30 min. After centrifugation at 4 °C at 2,000 rpm for 15 min, the upper layer was removed, dried under a nitrogen stream, transferred to a fresh tube with 2 × 500 μl hexane (hexane wash), dried again, and dissolved in 200 μl of isooctane:tetrahydrofuran (9:1). The sample (20 μl) was injected onto a 10 cm × 4.6 mm silica gel column (Spherisorb S5W, Waters, Milford, MA) and monitored using a SEDEX 55 evaporative light scattering detector (Richard Scientific, Inc., Novato, CA). The chromatograms were stored and evaluated using Star Chromatography software (version 4.0) (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). A standard curve utilizing triolein (Gnu-Check), cholesteryl oleate (Gnu-Check), cholesterol (Sigma), and 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol (Sigma) as internal standards was run every day. Overexpression of DGAT1 Increases the Synthesis and Secretion of Triglycerides in McA-RH7777 Cells—We first attempted to determine whether overexpression of human DGAT1 increased TG synthesis in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells. Overexpression of DGAT1 in McA-RH7777 cells increased TG synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of [3H]glycerol, by 5-fold (10,2384 ± 3,815 cpm/mg of cell protein) as compared with Neo vector control cells (20,275 ± 2,718 cpm/mg of cell protein, p < 0.01). Secretion of newly synthesized TG was also increased almost 3-fold in DGAT1 cells (14,876 ± 3,785 cpm/mg of cell protein) as compared with Neo vector control cells (5,326 ± 1,786 cpm/mg of cell protein, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the radioactivity data, total cellular TG mass in DGAT1 cells was also significantly increased as compared with Neo-transfected cells (18.25 ± 3.10 μg versus 12.75 ± 2.87 μg TG/mg of cell protein; p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). By contrast, overexpression of DGAT1 had no significant effect on either phospholipid (4,002 ± 2,432 × 103 cpm/mg of cell protein as compared with control 4,080.7 ± 2,818 × 103 cpm/mg of cell protein; n = 4) or CE synthesis (565 ± 29.9 × 103 cpm/mg of cell protein as compared with control 562 ± 43.7 × 103 cpm/mg of cell protein) as measured by incorporation of [3H]OA into these lipids in cells. These results are the means of three separate experiments using one clone of stably transfected McA-RH7777 cells. Similar results were obtained with three different clones. Overexpression of DGAT1 Increases the Assembly and Secretion of VLDL from McA-RH7777 Cells—Since TG synthesis and availability play a critical role in the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins in cultured liver cells (6Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 167-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu X. Sakata N. Dixon J. Ginsberg H.N. J.

Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 843-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined whether overexpression of DGAT1 in McA-RH7777 cells affected apoB secretion. As expected, concomitant with increased synthesis and secretion of TG, secretion of apoB was increased by more than 2-fold (relative densitometric units, 2.54 ± 0.65 normalized to Neo-transfected cells; p < 0.05) in cells overexpressing DGAT1, as measured by the incorporation of [35S]methionine (Fig. 1C). Increased secretion of apoB was associated with decreased intracellular disappearance of newly synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled apoB over a 90-min pulsechase protocol, relative to the neomycin control cells (Fig. 1D). This is consistent with rescue of apoB from intracellular degradation as a result of DGAT1 overexpression and targeting of nascent apoB for secretion on lipoproteins. Simultaneous stimulation of TG and apoB secretion suggested that more VLDL particles were being assembled and secreted. Indeed, experiments using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the increased numbers of apoB-containing lipoproteins secreted by McA-RH7777 cells overexpressing DGAT1 had buoyant densities characteristic of VLDL particles (Fig. 2). Overexpression of Either ACAT1 or ACAT2 Stimulates the Synthesis and Secretion of CE in McA-RH7777 Cells—We next evaluated the role of CE synthesis and availability in the assembly and secretion of apoB-lipoproteins. Recent studies have suggested that the enzymes for CE formation, ACAT1 and ACAT2, have different functions based on different tissue locations and membrane orientations (41Anderson R.A. Joyce C.

https://openalex.org/W2021253110,"ATP-binding cassette transporters use the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport structurally diverse molecules across prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes. Computer simulation studies of the “real-time” dynamics of the ATP binding process in BtuCD, the vitamin B12 importer from Escherichia coli, demonstrate that the docking of ATP to the catalytic pockets progressively draws the two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding cassettes toward each other. Movement of the cassettes into closer opposition in turn induces conformational rearrangement of α-helices in the transmembrane domain. The shape of the translocation pathway consequently changes in a manner that could aid the vectorial movement of vitamin B12. These results suggest that ATP binding may indeed represent the power stroke in the catalytic mechanism. Moreover, occlusion of ATP at one catalytic site is mechanically coupled to opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket at the second site. We propose that this asymmetry in nucleotide binding behavior at the two catalytic pockets may form the structural basis by which the transporter is able to alternate ATP hydrolysis from one site to the other. ATP-binding cassette transporters use the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport structurally diverse molecules across prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes. Computer simulation studies of the “real-time” dynamics of the ATP binding process in BtuCD, the vitamin B12 importer from Escherichia coli, demonstrate that the docking of ATP to the catalytic pockets progressively draws the two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding cassettes toward each other. Movement of the cassettes into closer opposition in turn induces conformational rearrangement of α-helices in the transmembrane domain. The shape of the translocation pathway consequently changes in a manner that could aid the vectorial movement of vitamin B12. These results suggest that ATP binding may indeed represent the power stroke in the catalytic mechanism. Moreover, occlusion of ATP at one catalytic site is mechanically coupled to opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket at the second site. We propose that this asymmetry in nucleotide binding behavior at the two catalytic pockets may form the structural basis by which the transporter is able to alternate ATP hydrolysis from one site to the other. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain.1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; TMD, transmembrane domain. transporters are a large group of proteins that facilitate the permeation of solutes across cell membranes. The energy for this process is provided by the hydrolysis of ATP (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). Members of the family so far identified include importers, exporters, receptors, and channels. Defects in a number of ABC transporters have been associated with serious hereditary disorders, of which cystic fibrosis is the best known (2Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5810) Google Scholar). In addition, increased expression levels of certain members of this ubiquitous family are a common cause of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the resistance of human tumor cells to anticancer drugs (3Borst P.

Science. 2001; 294: 2304-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) simulation studies of the ATP binding process in Escherichia coli BtuCD, an integral inner membrane protein that mediates the import of vitamin B12. Although ATP-driven dimerization of the ATP-binding cassettes has been predicted to represent the power stroke in the catalytic cycle (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar), the crystal structure of an intact dimer (including the transmembrane segments) in the ATP-bound state is unfortunately yet to be reported. Two computer simulations were designed to investigate the hypothesis that the transition from a weak to a tight ATP binding state may elicit the conformational changes needed to unidirectionally force vitamin B12 through the transmembrane pathway. The biologically functional unit of ABC transporters is typically dimeric. It consists of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) that function as a pathway for the permeation of solute and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). The highly conserved NBDs are the nucleotide-hydrolyzing engines that drive transport through the TMDs (see Fig. 1). Conserved segments found in the NBD include the Walker A motif (or P-loop), the Walker B motif (23Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar), the Q-loop, the D-loop, the H-motif, and the LSGGQ sequence. The Walker A and Walker B motifs are found in other ATP-binding proteins as well, whereas the LSGGQ segment is the signature motif of ABC transporters (24Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the NBD of a histidine importer, HisP (5Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), showed that each monomer has an overall “L” shape. The Walker A and B motifs are located in arm I, whereas the signature motif is in arm II. Other structures of NBDs that have since been solved include the structure of Rad50, an ATPase involved in DNA repair, which revealed the formation of a head-to-tail dimer in the presence of bound ATP but without the Mg2+ cofactor needed for hydrolysis (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The nucleotide was sandwiched between the Walker A and B motifs of one NBD and the signature motif of the opposing NBD. This had been predicted earlier through modeling studies by Jones and George (25Jones P.M. George A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 179: 187-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent structures of dimeric MJ0796 and MalK have shown that the head-to-tail sandwich dimer can exist in true ABC transporters (9Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 26Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). In the case of MJ0796, the dimer was obtained only after an E171Q mutation of the highly conserved catalytic glutamate at the end of the Walker B motif. The fact that the E171Q mutant is defective in ATP hydrolysis is believed to have stabilized the dimeric form. This was supported by studies on the glucose importer GlcV from Sulfolobus solfataricus (15Verdon G. Albers S.V. van Oosterwijk N. Dijkstra B.W. Driessen A.J.M. Thunnissen A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The NBD dimer of MalK, on the other hand, was obtained from the wild-type protein. Nevertheless, ATP hydrolysis was prevented by excluding Mg2+ using EDTA. It is also notable that MalK is different from MJ0796 and several other ABC transporters in that it has an additional regulatory domain, which may stabilize the nucleotide-bound dimer. Unlike the strongly conserved NBDs, the TMDs show significant variation. This divergence may account for the diverse range of molecules translocated by members of ABC transporter family. Known transport substrates vary from anions, lipids, and amino acids to peptides, polysaccharides, and whole proteins (24Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Three structures of complete transporters have been reported: the lipid A exporter MsbA from E. coli (Eco-MsbA) (8Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and Vibrio cholera (VC-MsbA) (7Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and the E. coli vitamin B12 importer BtuCD (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Although all three had no nucleotides bound at their catalytic sites, the structures were significantly different in conformation. In the Eco-MsbA structure, the NBDs are ∼50 Å apart with the nucleotide-binding sites facing away from the dimer axis. In VC-MsbA and BtuCD, they are in close opposition, facing each other in the same way as Rad50. However, the orientation of arm I of the NBD of VC-MsbA relative to arm II differs from that of BtuCD. A conformational arrangement similar to that of VC-MsbA has not been reported in previously solved structures of isolated NBDs with or without nucleotide. These variations may be indicative of the ability of the NBD to sample a large conformational space. Alternatively, they could be indicative of the crystal packing forces in MsbA. Although the rapidly growing body of structural data has helped to clarify the nature of subunit-subunit and nucleotide-protein interactions, details regarding the mechanism by which binding, hydrolysis, and release of nucleotide are coupled to steps in the transport cycle remain unresolved or controversial. We have simulated the transition of the NBDs of BtuCD from a semi-open state, as observed in the crystal structure, to a MgATP-bound closed state. Our simulations show that concomitant conformational transitions take place in the transmembrane domain, leading to the closure of the periplasmic end of the transportation pathway and initiating the opening of the cytoplasmic gate of the pathway. Although a similar mechanistic model was suggested for BtuCD by Locher et al. (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), it has recently been disputed by Chen et al. (9Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) based on their results on the ATP-bound dimer of the maltose transporter, MalK. They have instead proposed a tweezer-like model in which nucleotide binding leads to the reverse effect, i.e. closure of the cytoplasmic gate and opening of the periplasmic end. Our findings on conformational changes associated with MgATP binding to BtuCD are likely representative of bacterial importers in general and may be extensible to other ABC transporters. Starting coordinates for the simulations were obtained from the x-ray structure of BtuCD (Protein Data Bank entry 1L7V) (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Cyclotetravanadate was located in the ATP-binding sites in the crystal structure but did not affect the conformation of the NBD (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). We docked a MgATP molecule at the Walker A and B motifs of each of the two NBDs for the first simulation by superimposing the monomeric ATP-bound crystal structure of the nucleotide-binding domain of HisP (5Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F.-L. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar) onto the equivalent domains of BtuCD. A preequilibrated bilayer of 288 palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine lipids solvated in single point charge water (28Hermans J. Berendsen H.J.C. van Gunsteren W.F. Postma J.P.M. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1513-1518Crossref Scopus (697) Google Scholar) was used as a model of the biological membrane. Lipids were removed to generate a hole in the center of the bilayer. In a short simulation using the procedure of Faraldo-Gomez et al. (29Faraldo-Gomez J.D. Smith G.R. Sansom M.S.P. Eur. Biophys. J. 2002; 31: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), remaining lipids were removed from the hole to generate a BtuCD-shaped cavity. The protein was inserted into the cavity. The entire system was then resolvated, and 18 chloride counter ions were added. The system (98,094 atoms) was equilibrated for 250 ps with positional restraints applied on the protein atoms (Fig. 1) to allow the solvent to relax. A second independent simulation without MgATP was set up from the same protein and lipid coordinates, but water and 20 chloride ions were added. The production runs, without any restraints, were 15 ns long for each of the two simulations. Both simulations were run with GROMACS (30Berendsen H.J.C. van der Spoel D. van Drunen R. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (6848) Google Scholar, 31Lindahl E. Hess B. van der Spoel D. J. Mol. Model. 2001; 7: 306-317Crossref Google Scholar) using the ffG43a2 force field with a 2-fs time step. SETTLE (for water) and LINCS (32Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (10840) Google Scholar, 33Miyamoto S. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 952-962Crossref Scopus (4951) Google Scholar) were used to constrain covalent bond lengths. Long range electrostatic interactions were computed with the Particle-Mesh Ewald method (34Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (19718) Google Scholar). The temperature was kept at 300 K by separately coupling the protein, lipids, nucleotide, and solvent to an external temperature bath (τ = 0.1 ps) (35Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22543) Google Scholar). The pressure was kept constant at 1 bar by weak coupling (τ = 1.0 ps) to a pressure bath (35Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (22543) Google Scholar) in the z-dimension with constant area. The protein proved to be stable during both simulations. Molecular graphics were made using VMD (36Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35726) Google Scholar). Overall Conformational Changes—Snapshots of the ATP-bound and ATP-free protein at 15 ns are shown in Fig. 2 and in two supplementary movies (see supplemental materials). Fig. 2, B and C, are different orientations of the MgATP-bound snapshot showing the position of each docked ATP molecule at 15 ns. In Fig. 2, the yellow space-filling profile represents the pathway through which vitamin B12 is believed to pass during transport. The space between the two opposing NBDs is similarly presented in gray. It is evident from a visual comparison of Fig. 2A (nucleotide-free) with Fig. 2, B or C (MgATP-bound) that the docking of MgATP changes the overall shape of the protein. Conformational transitions occur in both the nucleotide-binding domains and the membrane-spanning domains. Differences in the size of the gray space-filling profile at the dimer interface of the NBDs after 15 ns of simulation without nucleotide (Fig. 2A) and with MgATP bound at the active site (Fig. 2, B and C) indicate that the docking of MgATP closes the gap between the two ATP-binding cassettes. The results of our simulation reveal that whereas the centers of mass of the two NBDs show a trend of movement toward each other in the MgATP-bound case, the two cassettes drift apart during the course of the MgATP-free simulation (details not shown). The small magnitudes of the overall center of mass motion recorded (1–2 Å) suggest that the TMD-NBD interface acts as a pivot about which the two NBDs rotate in a rigid body fashion toward each other. In effect, the dimension of the long axis of the intact transporter is shortened. Side chain displacements localized at the interface of the two NBDs contribute further to tighter dimerization of the NBDs. A striking feature was observed at the nucleotide-binding pockets. MgATP binding across the dimer interface occurred at only one of the two binding sites (Fig. 2C). At the other catalytic site, the binding pocket opened up, preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds between ATP and the signature motif of the opposing cassette (Fig. 2B). This occurred despite the fact that both nucleotides were docked in identical positions relative to the Walker A and B motifs of each NBD at the beginning of the simulation. Indeed, the separation distance between the centers of mass of the P-loop and the signature motif in the opposing NBD decreases by 0.4 Å at the catalytic site shown in Fig. 2C. The equivalent distance increases by 1.6 Å at the alternate site, shown in Fig. 2B. In contrast, the corresponding distances in the nucleotide-free simulation both increase by 2.2 and 2.6 Å, respectively (Fig. 2A). Events at the cytoplasmic end of the transmembrane pathway were analyzed by measuring the distance between the centers of mass of Thr-142 and Ser-143 located at the turn between membrane-spanning helices TM4 and TM5 in each half of the transporter. These residues were identified in the crystal structure as defining the gate region leading from the transmembrane pathway into the cytoplasmic water-filled channel at the interface of the NBDs and the TMDs (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). As the NBDs are drawn closer to each other due to ATP binding, the size of the gate region opening increases. This suggests that tighter ATP-induced association of the NBDs and the change in gate aperture are coupled. Analysis of the evolution of hydrogen-bonding patterns between ATP and the binding pocket and between the two NBDs suggests that closer association of the NBDs is aided by the formation of hydrogen bond contacts between residues of the two ATP-binding cassettes. ATP Binding—Over a time span of only 4 ns, significant conformational changes occur to optimize ATP binding at one of the two active sites in the ABC dimer. Surrounding water molecules were progressively displaced from hydrogen-bonding sites within the nucleotide-binding pocket located at the interface of the two opposing ATP-binding cassettes (Fig. 3, A and B). The signature motif in the opposite subunit reached out toward the docked ATP molecule. The nucleotide also shifted toward the signature motif and reoriented itself to form stable hydrogen bonds between the two side chain oxygen atoms of the glutamate residue in the LSGGE signature motif and the two hydroxyl hydrogen atoms in the ribose moiety of ATP. This is consistent with equivalent hydrogen bonds formed between the ribose hydroxyls and the corresponding Gln of the LSGGQ motifs in the ATP-bound dimers of MalK and E171Q-MJ0796 (26Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). The Glu residue of the LSGGE signature motif of BtuCD also forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with one of the γ-phosphate oxygen atoms of ATP. Coordination of the magnesium ion cofactor occurred via the α-, β-, and γ-phosphate oxygen atoms of ATP, Gln-80 of the Q-loop, as well as Ser-40 of the Walker A motif and a solvent water molecule. Direct contact between metal ion cofactors and Gln-80 has been similarly observed in the dimeric crystal structures of Rad50-AMPPNPMG2+ and E171Q-MJ0796-Na+ (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 26Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Allosteric Control of Translocation Pathway—The transmembrane translocation pathway becomes constricted as the crystal structure relaxes to new conformations in solution without bound MgATP (Fig. 4, A and B). It is, however, evident from a comparison of the MgATP-bound and MgATP-free structures at 15 ns (Fig. 4, B and C) that further constriction of the translocation pathway occurs as an effect of nucleotide occupancy. Fig. 4, A–C, show that the reorientation of transmembrane helix 5 (TM5) in each monomeric unit plays an important role in mediating changes in pathway profile. To quantitatively map out the changes taking place in the membrane-spanning pathway, separation distances between equivalent C-α atoms of TM5 from each subunit were measured at approximately every turn of the helix from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic end. The results are presented in Fig. 5. In the crystal structure, the periplasmic end of the translocation pathway was open wide enough to accommodate a vitamin B12 molecule (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Our results show that the periplasmic opening collapses by ∼7 Å in the ligand-free simulations. This implies that the periplasmic entrance may be more constricted in solution than it is in the crystal structure. The observed mobility may also explain why residues at the entrance to the periplasm were only partly resolved in the crystal structure (11Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the docking of MgATP at the catalytic sites allosterically induces further constriction of the translocation pathway by up to 5 Å. Profile differences of interest are also observable at the gate region (Thr-142 and Ser-143) that leads into the water-filled channel at the center of the transporter. Vitamin B12 is believed to escape into the cytoplasm of the cell through this channel. The dimension of the opening at the gate region increases in response to the docking of MgATP, whereas in the absence of MgATP, it becomes slightly narrower, as evident in the segment containing residues 142–150 in Fig. 5. High resolution structures have played an important role in aiding our understanding of the mechanism of ABC transporters. Protein function, however, involves movement, and molecular dynamics simulations are one way of probing potential functional motions starting from rigid crystal structures. Several recent computer simulation studies have demonstrated the usefulness of accessible conformational states in unraveling the functional mechanics of protein systems comparable with BtuCD (22Berendsen H.J.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2304-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 37de Groot B.L. Grubmüller H. Science. 2001; 294: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 38Böckmann R.A. Grubmüller H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2002; 9: 198-202Google Scholar). The main limitation of modern simulations is the fact that conformations separated by high energy barriers are unlikely to be visited during the simulation on a time scale that can be simulated directly. The fast changes observed in the nucleotide-binding domains and in the transmembrane domains indicate significant driving forces for these motions. Nucleotide Binding—Nucleotide binding is a two-step process. First, MgATP diffuses and docks into the catalytic pocket, producing a weak binding conformation of the complex. The nucleotide is subsequently sequestered, and binding interactions are optimized to generate a tight binding conformation. For F1F0-ATP synthase, Antes et al. (39Antes I. Chandler D. Wang H.Y. Oster G. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 695-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have suggested that energy transduction occurs during the transition from the weak to the tight binding state. In our simulation, we circumvent the slow diffusion process and start with the MgATP weakly docked at the binding pocket. Within only 4 ns, there is evidence that the transition of the complex from the weak to the tight binding state has largely occurred. The resulting dimer likely represents the catalytically competent state of the ATP-binding cassette (13Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 789-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The short time scale in which this transition takes place is an indication of the strong attractive force involved and suggests that the energy transduced as a result may be sufficient to drive the power stroke of the transporter. However, we observe that just one ATP molecule appears capable of holding the transporter in the closed nucleotide-bound state. Tight ATP binding at one catalytic site occurs concomitantly with opening of the binding pocket at the alternate site in a manner that may help create an exit path for the release of hydrolyzed nucleotide. This finding may at first appear contrary to evidence from recent crystal structures of dimeric NBDs of Rad50, MJ0796, and MalK in which ATP is bound at each of the two catalytic sites (9Chen J.

However, it is notable that in all three cases either the protein used was a catalytically incapacitated mutant (MJ0796 (E171Q)) or the magnesium cofactor was excluded to prevent hydrolysis (Rad50 and Malk). The crystal structure of catalytically competent wild-type NBDs with MgATP stably bound at both nucleotide-binding sites has so far proven elusive. We suggest that this may be attributed to the asymmetry in ATP binding observed in our simulations. The singly occupied dimer is unstable without additional contacts provided by the transmembrane domain. Under non-hydrolyzing conditions, the two binding sites are more likely to be simultaneously occupied with ATP. Together, both ATP molecules may thus provide sufficient contacts to stabilize the dimer in the absence of transmembrane domains as observed in the crystal structures of Rad50, MJ0796, and MalK. Other lines of experimental evidence in support of this kind of asymmetry include vanadate trapping studies in which the protein is incubated with vanadate and [α-32P]MgATP (40Urbatsch I.L.

In this study, regulation of Ca2+ release by phosphorylation of type 1 InsP3R (InsP3R-1) was investigated by constructing “phosphomimetic” charge mutations in the functionally important phosphorylation sites of both the S2+ and S2- InsP3R-1 splice variants. Ca2+ release was investigated following expression in Dt-40 3ko cells devoid of endogenous InsP3R. In cells expressing either the S1755E S2+ or S1589E/S1755E S2- InsP3R-1, InsP3-induced Ca2+ release was markedly enhanced compared with nonphosphorylatable S2+ S1755A and S2- S1589A/S1755A mutants. Ca2+ release through the S2- S1589E/S1755E InsP3R-1 was enhanced ∼8-fold over wild type and ∼50-fold when compared with the nonphosphorylatable S2- S1589A/S1755A mutant. In cells expressing S2- InsP3R-1 with single mutations in either S1589E or S1755E, the sensitivity of Ca2+ release was enhanced ∼3-fold; sensitivity was midway between the wild type and the double glutamate mutation. Paradoxically, forskolin treatment of cells expressing either single Ser/Glu mutation failed to further enhance Ca2+ release. The sensitivity of Ca2+ release in cells expressing S2+ S1755E InsP3R-1 was comparable with the sensitivity of S2- S1589E/S1755E InsP3R-1. In contrast, mutation of S2+ S1589E InsP3R-1 resulted in a receptor with comparable sensitivity to wild type cells. Expression of S2- S1589E/S1755E InsP3R-1 resulted in robust Ca2+ oscillations when cells were stimulated with concentrations of α-IgM antibody that were threshold for stimulation in S2- wild type InsP3R-1-expressing cells. However, at higher concentrations of α-IgM antibody, Ca2+ oscillations of a similar period and magnitude were initiated in cells expressing either wild type or S2- phosphomimetic mutations. Thus, regulation by phosphorylation of the functional sensitivity of InsP3R-1 appears to define the threshold at which oscillations are initiated but not the frequency or amplitude of the signal when established.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are intracellular ion channels that function to couple the activation of cell surface receptors for neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors to the initiation of intracellular Ca2+ release (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Three genes have been cloned that encode distinct proteins of a molecular mass of ∼300 kDa, named the type 1 (InsP3R-1), 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3R-1, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; CCh, carbamylcholine (carbachol); PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKG, cGMP dependent protein kinase; 8-Br cGMP, 8-bromoguanosine-3′, 5′-cyclic monophosphate; ci-IP3/PM, caged isopropylidene inositol trisphosphate; WT, wild type; cm-IP3, caged methoxymethylene inositol trisphosphate. type 2 (InsP3R-2), and type 3 (InsP3R-3) InsP3Rs (2Furuichi T.

In addition, multiple receptor proteins with distinct tissue distributions are produced by alternate splicing of the type 1 receptor gene (5Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S.

Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression level and complement of receptors differ in individual tissues, and this together with regulation of the activity of the channel is thought to be a major determinant of the rich diversity of Ca2+ signaling events observed in cells (7Taylor C.W.

The functional channel is formed co-translationally by the tetrameric association of four individual receptor subunits (9Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol.

Each subunit has a binding site for InsP3 toward the N terminus formed by a cluster of positively charged amino acids thought to coordinate the negatively charged phosphate groups of InsP3 (11Yoshikawa F.

Although the InsP3-binding pocket and channel pore are highly conserved between InsP3R family members, the intervening sequence between the binding region and pore is more divergent and consists of the so-called “regulatory and coupling” or “modulatory” domain. This region, consisting of ∼1600 amino acids, is thought to be important in modulating the Ca2+ release properties of the InsP3R. Indeed, Ca2+ release through the InsP3R is markedly influenced by many factors, most importantly by Ca2+ itself (17Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). InsP3R activity is also influenced through interaction with numerous factors such as proteins, adenine nucleotides, and phosphorylation and in particular by cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases (8Patel S. Joseph S.K. Thomas A.P. Cell Calcium. 1999; 25: 247-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Two protein kinase A (PKA) consensus sites (RRXS) at Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 are present in the InsP3R-1 (5Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the most recent studies suggest that phosphorylation of these sites results in a marked enhancement of Ca2+ release (19Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Tang T.S. Tu H. Wang Z. Bezprozvanny I. J.

Most interestingly, these sites are conserved through evolution from Drosophila to humans in InsP3R-1, but corresponding sites are not present in either the InsP3R-2 or InsP3R-3. It should be noted, however, that other regions, which are presently not defined, appear to function as PKA phosphorylation sites in InsP3R-2 and InsP3R-3. Several reports have demonstrated biochemically that both Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 can be phosphorylated in InsP3R-1 (18Soulsby M.D. Alzayady K. Xu Q. Wojcikiewicz R.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Ferris C.D. Cameron A.M. Bredt D.S. Huganir R.L. Snyder S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7467-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, these studies have not provided a consensus as to which sites are important physiologically in tissue that expresses either of the two major splice variants of InsP3R-1. A recent study (19Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) from our laboratory has elucidated the particular sites that are functionally important for the phosphoregulation of the two major splice variants of the InsP3R-1. These studies were performed by using mutational analysis by substituting alanine for the serine residues present at individual putative phosphorylation sites. Although phosphorylation of both neuronal (S2+) and peripheral (S2-) forms of InsP3R-1 by PKA resulted in enhanced Ca2+ release, mutational analysis indicated that only phosphorylation of Ser-1755 was functionally important in the neuronal S2+ InsP3R-1. In contrast, both Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 appeared to be phosphorylated and significant in the peripheral S2- form of InsP3R-1. In addition, although the S2+ form of the receptor was subject to direct phosphoregulation by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), the S2- form was not influenced by activation of PKG. These data represent one of the few major differences reported for the regulation of the two major splice variants of the InsP3R-1. In the present study, we have constructed charge mutations, substituting glutamate residues for the serine residues in the functionally important phosphorylation sites in both S2- and S2+ variants of the InsP3R-1. These mutations are predicted to mimic phosphorylation and to allow the assessment of the functional effects of phosphorylation of InsP3R-1. Most importantly, the Ca2+ release properties of phosphomimetic mutations are predicted to be essentially independent of cell type-specific factors, including the expression of accessory proteins such as protein A-kinase anchoring proteins. These effects should also be unambiguously specific to InsP3R and thus independent of confounding PKA effects on other Ca2+-handling machinery. This latter consideration has historically plagued the functional assessment of PKA phosphorylation of InsP3R. These mutations have allowed us to define the relative sensitivity of Ca2+ release of the phosphomimetic mutations and to confirm which sites are important in each splice variant. The present study has also addressed whether phosphorylation of individual sites is permissive or additive in each splice variant, and we have investigated the consequences of phosphorylating InsP3R-1 on Ca2+ oscillations, the physiological pattern of Ca2+ signaling in nonelectrically excitable cells. The acetoxymethyl esters of Fura-2 and Fluo-4 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell-permeable cyclic nucleotides and forskolin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The Dt-40 cells lacking InsP3R (Dt-40 3ko) were kindly provided by Dr. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Japan) and were maintained as described previously (25Kubista H. Hawkins T. Moss S.E.

Production of Mutations—The rat S2+ InsP3R-1 in the expression plasmid pIRES-GFP was digested with the restriction endonuclease SalI. The overhang created by digestion was blunted by using T4 polymerase. An EcoRI linker was then ligated onto the blunted ends of the construct. The entire receptor DNA was excised from the plasmid using EcoRI and ligated into the plasmid MXT-1. The region containing the S2- splice variant and potential PKA phosphorylation sites was excised from its backbone in pCDNA 3.1+ by RsrII and KasI and ligated into the InsP3R construct in MXT-1. The potential PKA phosphorylation sites Ser-1589 and Ser-1755 were mutated, individually in both splice variants and together in the S2- splice variant, to alanines or glutamates by using sequential PCR mutagenesis. The outside primers used for the mutagenesis reaction flanked the restriction sites RsrII and KasI. Following mutation, the resulting fragments were cut with RsrII and KasI and inserted into the InsP3R-1 backbone at the corresponding sites. The mutations were confirmed by Big Dye fluorescent sequencing. Mutated receptor DNAs were excised from MXT-1 by using EcoRI and ligated into the mammalian expression vector pGW (provided by Dr. David Yue, The Johns Hopkins University). Orientation was confirmed by using restriction enzyme digestion. Mutants were named based on the splice variant, either S2+ or S2- followed by the amino acid present at position 1589 and 1755. Thus, a mutation in S2+ InsP3R-1 S1755E is designated,“S2+ SE,” and in InsP3R-1 S2+ S1755A is designated “S2+ SA”. Similarly, an S2- InsP3R-1 with mutations in both S1589E and S1755E is designated “S2- EE”. The numbering of residues is based on the full-length rat InsP3R-1. Transfection of Dt-40 Cells—Dt-40 cells lacking all three InsP3 receptor subtypes were transfected by using electroporation at 350 V and 950 microfarads (4-mm gap cuvette). 2 × 107 cells were co-transfected with 25 μg of the InsP3R-1 cDNA, 25 μg of the muscarinic type 3 (m3R) receptor DNA, and 4 μg of the red fluorescent protein plasmid pH-cRed1-N1 (Clontech). Cells were incubated with DNA in 500 μl of Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) on ice for 10 min. The cell/DNA mixture was electroporated, incubated on ice for 30 min, increased to 5 ml with Opti-MEM, and placed in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39 °C for 5 h. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 12 ml of complete RPMI media (Invitrogen). Transfection efficiency was typically ∼20%. Experiments were performed within 32 h of transfection.

Li, unpublished data. culture flasks and allowed to grow to near-confluency. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of each S2- InsP3R-1 DNA construct by using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The following day, batches of cells were treated in the presence or absence of 20 μm forskolin for 10 min, aspirated from flasks, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal α-InsP3R-1 antibody that recognizes amino acids 2731–2749 of InsP3R-1. Immunoprecipitates were separated on 5% SDS gels transferred to nitrocellulose and then probed with either the α-InsP3R-1 antibody or a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated state of Ser-1755 (28Pieper A.A. Brat D.J. O'Hearn E. Krug D.K. Kaplin A.I. Takahashi K. Greenberg J.H. Ginty D. Molliver M.E. Snyder S.H.

Blots that were probed with α-phospho-Ser-1755 were stripped and reprobed with the α-InsP3R-1 antisera to confirm the presence and relative quantity of the InsP3R-1. Digital Imaging of [Ca+2]i—Transfected Dt-40 3ko cells were washed once in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HEPES-PSS) containing (in mm) 5.5 glucose, 137 NaCl, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.2 CaCl2, and 1% w/v bovine serum albumin. Cells were then resuspended in bovine serum albumin HEPES-PSS with 1 μm Fura-2 (AM), placed on a 15-mm glass coverslip in a low volume perfusion chamber, and allowed to adhere for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were perfused continuously for 10 min with HEPES-PSS before experimentation to allow complete Fura-2 de-esterification. A field of cells for each experiment was chosen that contained a wide range of transfection efficiency based upon the intensity of red fluorescence emitted when excited at 560 nm. Individual cells that had emission gray levels between 1500 and 2500 were subsequently chosen to standardize expression levels. [Ca2+]i imaging was performed essentially as described previously by using an inverted epifluorescence Nikon microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3) (19Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were excited alternately with light at 340 and 380 ± 10 nm bandpass filters (Chroma, Rockingham, VT) using a monochrometer (TILL Photonics, Pleasanton, CA). Fluorescence images were captured and digitized with a digital camera driven by TILL Photonics software. Images were captured every 2 s with an exposure of 2 ms and 4 by 4 binning. 340/380 ratio images were calculated online and stored immediately to a hard disk. Flash Photolysis—Transfected cells were simultaneously loaded with the visible wavelength indicator Fluo-4 and a cell-permeable form of caged inositol trisphosphate (ci-IP3/PM) for 30 min. ci-IP3/PM is a homologue of cm-IP3/PM. The 2- and 3-hydroxyls of the inositol ring are protected by an isopropylidene group in ci-IP3/PM and are protected by a methoxymethylene group in cm-IP3/PM (29Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Like cm-IP3/PM, ci-IP3/PM diffuses across cell membranes, and the PM group is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases, and Ca2+ release can be induced upon photo-uncaging as i-IP3 is liberated from the cage and acts in a similar fashion to InsP3 at InsP3R. 2W.-H. Li, unpublished data. A further period of ∼30 min was allowed for de-esterification of both dye and cage. Cells were illuminated at 488 ± 10 nm and fluorescence collected through a 525 ± 25-nm bandpass filter and captured using the Till Photonics imaging suite. These traces are displayed as % ΔF/Fo, where F is the recorded fluorescence, and Fo is the mean of the initial 10 sequential frames. Photolytic release was performed as described previously by using a pulsed xenon arc lamp (Till Photonics). A high intensity (0.5–5 ms duration; 80 J) discharge of UV light (360 ± 7.5 nm) was reflected onto the plane of focus by using a DM400 dichroic mirror and Nikon 40× oil immersion objective, 1.3 NA. Frequency Distribution of Ca2+Oscillations—Cells transfected with WT and mutant S2- isoforms were stimulated with varying concentrations of an α-IgM antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). Infrequent Ca2+ oscillations were produced presumably through B cell receptor cross-linking, activation of phospholipase C-γ, and subsequent production of InsP3. The frequency of Ca2+ oscillations was determined by selecting individual peaks that displayed an increase in ratio units greater than 0.05 and are listed as frequency in milliHertz (number of oscillations in 1000 s). Concentration-Response Relationships—Normalized ΔF concentration-response relationships were fit with the following logistic Equation 1,ΔF=1/(1+(C/EC50)SlopeΔF(Eq. 1) where ΔF is the change in fluorescence normalized to the maximal response; C is agent concentration; EC50 is the concentration where the response is half of maximum, and SlopeΔF is a slope factor related to the Hill coefficient. Statistical Analysis—The effects of treatment were determined by normalizing the peak change in fluorescence ratio by stimulation following forskolin or 8-Br-cGMP exposure to that of stimulation in control HEPES-PSS. Thus, pooled data represent a normalized fold increase over control for the treated trial. In all cases where statistical significance is indicated, two-tailed heteroscedastic t tests were performed. p values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance and are denoted by an asterisk in the figures. Phosphomimetic Mutations in Functionally Important Phosphorylation Sites in Both S2+ and S2- InsP3R-1 Result in Enhanced Ca2+Release—Phosphorylation of proteins results in the addition of net negative charge to the phosphoacceptor residue. In the case of PKA phosphoregulation, the functional effects of phosphorylation are thought to occur as the negative charge added to the serine or (less frequently) threonine residues neutralizes the positive charge of basic arginine or lysine residues present upstream in the classical RRX(S/T) consensus motif (30Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This charge neutralization, in turn, is thought to result in a conformational change in the protein. A common approach employed to investigate the functional effects of phosphorylation is to construct phosphomimetic mutations whereby glutamic or aspartic acid residues are substituted at the phosphoacceptor site (31Tateyama M. Rivolta I. Clancy C.E. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46718-46726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Reiken S. Lacampagne A. Zhou H. Kherani A. Lehnart S.E.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 919-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The rationale for this strategy is that the negatively charged side chain of the substituted acidic amino acid will mimic, to an extent, the addition of a phosphate moiety to the protein. To investigate the consequences of InsP3R-1 phosphorylation, we analyzed in Dt-40 3ko cells the Ca2+ release properties of phosphomimetic mutations in the functionally important sites in both S2- and S2+ InsP3R-1. This cell line provides the only known InsP3R null background (26Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 27Miyakawa T. Maeda A. Yamazawa T. Hirose K. Kurosaki T. Iino M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In initial experiments, a comparison was made between the sensitivity of Ca2+ release by InsP3R-1 phosphomimetic mutations versus nonphosphorylatable alanine mutations at the sites we reported previously (19Wagner II, L.E. Li W.H. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45811-45817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to be relevant. Dt-40 3ko cells were transfected with DNA encoding HcRed to facilitate identification of transfected cells and either S2- S1589E/S1755E InsP3R-1 (S2- EE) or S2- S1589A/S1755A (S2- AA). Ca2+ release was monitored following flash photolysis of ci-IP3, a cell-permeable form of caged InsP3. This experimental paradigm provides a relatively direct assessment of the effects of InsP3R-1 phosphorylation on the Ca2+ release process. The amount of ci-IP3 photo-released was controlled by varying the duration of the UV flash discharge (0.5–5 ms). No increase in [Ca2+]i was observed following the longest UV discharge in cells either not loaded with ci-IP3/PM or not expressing HcRed. Fig. 1, B and C, shows traces from typical experiments in individual Dt-40 3ko cells expressing S2- EE or S2- AA (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively, and pooled data in Fig. 1F). In cells expressing S2- EE, Ca2+ release as defined by a >0.05% ΔF/Fo increase in initial fluo-4 fluorescence was observed in ∼60% of cells when exposed to UV discharge for 0.5 ms. Subsequent exposure to UV light for 1.25 ms elicited a more robust increase in [Ca2+]i in all cells. Finally, photo-release following a 5-ms flash, in general evoked a further increase in the magnitude of Ca2+ release. In contrast, an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ was never observed under identical conditions following a 0.5-ms UV flash in cells expressing S2- AA. A significant Ca2+ release was only observed in ∼50% of cells following a 1.25-ms flash, and the majority of cells only responded to the longest uncaging duration, albeit with a smaller magnitude than in S2- EE-expressing cells exposed to the same stimulus. A similar pattern of sensitivity was observed in Dt-40 3ko cells expressing S2+ S1755E (S2+ SE) and S2+ S1755A (S2+ SA) as shown in Fig. 1, D and E, respectively, and pooled data in Fig. 1G. Cells expressing S2+ SE responded more robustly to photolysis of ci-IP3 than cells expressing S2+ SA exposed to an identical stimulus. These data indicate that serine to glutamate mutations at the functionally important phosphorylation sites in both splice variants of InsP3R-1 are “phosphomimetic,” i.e. charge mutations mimic phosphorylation in that these constructs display an apparent increased functional sensitivity to InsP3. Sensitivity of S2- InsP3R-1 and Phosphorylation Site Mutants—Experiments were next performed to determine the relative sensitivity of Ca2+ release through the phosphomimetic mutations of the S2- InsP3R-1 with respect to the wild type and phosphorylation-deficient mutants. Dt-40 3ko cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding m3R, HcRed together with the InsP3R-1 construct of interest. Stimulation with the muscarinic agonist CCh results in robust increases in [Ca2+]i in transfected cells through the Gαq/11-coupled stimulation of phospholipase C-β and subsequent formation of InsP3. The magnitude of the initial peak provides a good estimation of the extent of Ca2+ release as this parameter in Dt-40 cells, like many cells, is essentially independent of Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, in Dt-40 cells the [Ca2+]i response to stimulation with CCh does not appreciably desensitize, and thus the effects of multiple concentrations of agonist can be assessed in a single cell. Individual HcRed-expressing cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of CCh (1 nm to1 μm) for 60 s followed by a 5-min wash between applications of agonist. In each case, these experiments were performed on multiple cells, expressing a narrow range of HcRed fluorescence and from multiple batches of transfected cells to minimize variation because of expression level of m3R and InsP3R-1. Concentration-response relationships were generated by normalizing each initial peak to the maximum response in the individual cell and subsequently averaging the pool of cells expressing a particular construct. Fig. 2A shows a typical example of this experimental procedure performed on Dt-40 3ko cells expressing S2- EE. A significant increase in Ca2+ was detected in the majority of S2- EE-expressing cells following stimulation with 1 nm CCh, and the peak response occurred following stimulation between 10 and 50 nm CCh. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2, B and C, Ca2+ release following CCh stimulation in the wild type S2- InsP3R-1 o"

Here we addressed the role of PHGPx in the protection against UV irradiation-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). For this purpose, we created human dermal fibroblast cell lines overexpressing human PHGPx. Overexpression led to a significant increase in PHGPx activity. In contrast to a maximal 4.5-fold induction of specific MMP-1 mRNA levels in vector-transfected cells at 24 h after UVA irradiation, no MMP-1 induction occurred at any studied time point after UVA treatment of PHGPx-overexpressing fibroblasts. As interleukin-6 (IL-6) was earlier shown to mediate the UVA induction of MMP-1, we studied whether PHGPx overexpression might interfere with the NFκB-mediated IL-6 induction and downstream signaling. Using transient transfections of IL-6 promoter constructs containing NFκB binding sites, we observed a high induction of the reporter gene luciferase in vector-transfected control cells and a significantly lower induction in PHGPx-overexpressing fibroblasts following UVA irradiation. Consistently both UVA irradiation and treatment of fibroblasts with PCOOHs led to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, whereas cells overexpressing PHGPx exhibited impaired NFκB activation, p65 phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation. In line with this, the PHGPx-overexpressing fibroblasts showed a reduced constitutive and UVA irradiation-induced IL-6 release. After incubating PHGPx-overexpressing cells with PCOOHs a reduced induction of IL-6 was observed. This together with the suppression of UVA irradiation-induced IL-6 release in the presence of Trolox, a chain breaker of PCOOH-initiated lipid peroxidation, indicates that UVA irradiation-induced PCOOHs and subsequent lipid peroxides initiate the NFκB-mediated induction of IL-6, which mediates the induction of MMP-1. Our finding is particularly relevant in light of the already available small molecule mimetics of PHGPx.

The damage is mainly conferred by phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides (PCOOHs), among other peroxides, which initiate the chain reaction of lipid peroxidation. Apart from permanent genetic changes involving protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, reactive oxygen species and phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxides activate cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways that are related to growth, differentiation, senescence, and tissue degradation. Therefore, ROS and PCOOHs have been implicated to play a causal role in cancer, aging, and other degenerative diseases like arteriosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and impaired wound healing. These pathological states share unique features and are all characterized by a dysregulated localized, as in cancer invasion and metastasis, or diffuse connective tissue breakdown due to enhanced activity of various matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (4Henriksen T.

The ever growing family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) now comprises at least 28 members with partly distinct, partly overlapping substrate specificities for different extracellular matrix proteins of the connective tissue (11Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). MMP-1 exhibits substrate specificity for the interstitial collagens type I and III, which comprise more than 90% of the extracellular matrix of the skin, and is the most important matrix metalloproteinase in degradation of the extracellular matrix in photoaging (12Brennan M.

Fibroblast-derived MMP-1 has been found to be induced upon UVA and UVB irradiation (13Herrmann G. Wlaschek M. Lange T.S. Prenzel K. Goerz G. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp.

Using an antisense strategy as well as neutralizing antibodies, we have shown previously that the ROS-mediated autocrine release of interleukin-6 upon UVA and UVB irradiation is responsible for the up-regulation of MMP-1 (16Wlaschek M.

Research on the regulation of signal transduction in pathways related to interleukin-6 by endogenous and environmental stimuli like ROS and intermediates thereof is a matter of increasing interest and relevance (20Janknecht R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) since it may provide ultimate clues for mechanisms underlying connective tissue degradation in pathological states. In fact, ROS have been shown to activate transcription factors like NFκB and AP-1 in carcinoma cell lines of epithelial origin (21Schmidt K.N. Traenckner E.B. Meier B. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27136-27142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 22Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Large efforts have been made to better define the involvement of distinct ROS and their intermediates in degenerative conditions to identify enzymes and molecules that can scavenge oxygen radicals for their potential in the prevention and therapy of these disorders. To protect against oxidant injury, aerobic cells have evolved a multilayered interdependent antioxidant system that includes enzymatic and non-enzymatic components. The individual antioxidant enzymes are located in specific subcellular sites and reveal distinct substrate specificity. Among these, the phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), a monomer selenoprotein, has been the subject of particular interest because it confers main protection against the UV irradiation/ROS-induced peroxidation of phospholipids in cellular membranes. In this regard, PHGPx detoxifies phospholipid hydroperoxides to the corresponding alcohols at the expense of reduced glutathione or other reducing agents (23Ursini F. Maiorino M. Gregolin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 839: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 24Schnurr K. Belkner J. Ursini F. Schewe T. Kuhn H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 454-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCOOHs, by their lipid peroxidation-perpetuating properties, can severely impair membrane function, modify and inactivate proteins, introduce mutagenic alterations into DNA (26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1999: 284-313Google Scholar), and feed into signal transduction pathways that have been associated with pathologies like arteriosclerosis, hyperoxic lung injury, asthma, and cancer (27Ames B.N.

Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). In contrast to the PHGPx, the classical cytoplasmic glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) can only interfere with membrane lipid peroxidation through concerted action with phospholipases (30van Kruijk F.J.G.M. Sevanian M. Handelmann G.J. Dratz E.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 31-34Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The formation of PCOOHs and subsequent lipid peroxides is directly initiated via singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals and indirectly initiated by hydrogen peroxides during the Fenton reaction (26Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 3rd Ed. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1999: 284-313Google Scholar). Interestingly singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxides have been identified as early events in the signaling sequence eventually leading to the induction of MMP-1 after either UVA or UVB irradiation (31Brenneisen P.

Fibroblasts stably overexpressing PHGPx with a defined capacity for the removal of PCOOHs were generated as well suited tools (1Sies H. Angew. Chem. 1986; 25: 1058-1071Crossref Scopus (1040) Google Scholar) to evaluate the protective value of increased PHGPx activity in terms of suppression of UVA irradiation-induced up-regulation of MMP-1 and (2Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) to further dissect the role of PCOOHs and PHGPx in signaling mechanisms underlying connective tissue degradation. Reagents—The MMP-1 probe used was a 920-bp HindIII/SmaI fragment of human collagenase cDNA (33Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Poting A. Lucke-Huhle C. Herrlich P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A 24-mer oligonucleotide (5′-ACG GTA TCT GAT CGT CTT CGA ACC-3′) (34Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) for the 18 S rRNA was synthesized (Amersham Biosciences). The vitamin E derivative Trolox was obtained from Sigma. Antibodies against p65 and topoisomerase I were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and those against the phosphorylated forms of p65 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cell Cultures—The human skin fibroblast cell line 1306 was obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC), Salisbury, UK (ECACC no. 90011887). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 2 mm glutamine, 400 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged at a 1:3 dilution every 3 days. Recombinant cells were selected in neomycin (G418) (Invitrogen) at 150 μg/ml, a concentration that completely inhibited the growth of non-transfected cells. Subconfluent cells were preincubated for 16 h with 100 μm Trolox, subsequently irradiated with UVA light at a dose of 300 kJ/m2, and grown for 6 h prior to the analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in the supernatant by an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). Subconfluent cells were incubated for 2 h with PCOOHs in cell culture medium containing 3% fetal calf serum, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated for 22 h prior to the analysis of IL-6 levels in the supernatant by an ELISA. Expression Vector for Human PHGPx and Cell Transfection—The 0.9-kb human PHGPx cDNA fragment flanked by the EcoRI restriction site was inserted into the EcoRI site of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The human testis PHGPx cDNA (35Esworthy R.S. Doan K. Doroshow J.H. Chu F.F. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 317-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) encodes the entire 197-amino acid proprotein and includes 80 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 125 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences. The expression vector used contains the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) major intermediate early promoter/enhancer region and a neomycin resistance marker for the selection of stable transformants in the presence of G418. Subconfluent cultures of the fibroblast cells 1306 were transfected with the PHGPx expression vector (20 μg) by calcium phosphate precipitation (36Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar) or by the transfection reagent LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Both methods gave similar results. For selection of stable transfectants, G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the cells 24 h after transfection. Individual neomycin-resistant cell clones were screened by measuring PGHPx activity (see below). Control cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3 alone and maintained under identical conditions. Assays for Determination of the Activity of Different Antioxidant Enzymes—All assays were performed with cells in a logarithmic growth phase. The activity of superoxide dismutase was detected by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction method according to Beauchamp and Fridovich (37Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9904) Google Scholar). The inhibition of nitroblue tetrazolium by superoxide dismutase in the aerobic xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was followed at 560 nm. Catalase activity was measured by monitoring the disappearance of H2O2 at 240 nm in the presence of cellular lysates (38Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18668) Google Scholar). Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was assayed using GSH and t-butyl hydroperoxide as substrate and monitoring GSSG production through NADPH oxidation by glutathione reductase (39Flohe L. Gunzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4071) Google Scholar). The PHGPx activity was determined similarly except that phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide instead of t-butyl hydroperoxide was used (40Maiorino M. Chu F.F. Ursini F. Davies K.J. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7728-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the cell culture medium was supplemented with 100 nm Na2SeO3. Protein content was determined using Coomassie Blue with albumin as standard (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Light Source and UV Irradiation—Confluent fibroblast monolayer cultures were irradiated at a distance of 40 cm using a high intensity 3-kilowatt metal halogenide UVA source (UVASUN3000 equipped with the UVASUN safety filters) emitting wavelengths in the 340–450-nm range (Mutzhas, Munich, Germany) (42Mutzhas M.F. Holzle E. Hofmann C. Plewig G. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1981; 76: 42-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Spectral irradiance was measured routinely with an OL-754 UV/visible light spectroradiometer calibrated against the OL-752-10 spectral irradiance standard certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Optronic Laboratories, Orlando, FL). The irradiation intensity at the surface of the cells was 45 milliwatts/cm2. Irradiation fluences were monitored with a UVA dosimeter (UVA Meter, Dr. Hönle, Martinsried, Germany). During irradiation, cells were incubated in PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) and maintained at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled water bath. Following irradiation, PBS was replaced by fresh medium with supplements, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time. Cytotoxicity Assay—The viability of the transfectants was monitored 24 h after UVA irradiation. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was used for the quantification of living, metabolically active cells. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide to a purple formazan dye, which can be measured photometrically between 550 and 600 nm (43Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of formazan formation in cells irradiated with UVA irradiation compared with mock-treated cells. We intended to avoid interference of cytotoxicity. Therefore irradiation was carried out with a dose of 300 kJ/m2. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blots using specific cDNA probes or oligonucleotides for MMP-1, 18 S rRNA, β-actin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for sequential hybridization (3Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Poswig A. Briviba K. Oberley T.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol.

Briefly, after extraction of total RNA, equal amounts of total RNA (5–20 μg/lane) were fractionated by size on a 0.9% 2.2 m formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted to GeneScreen filters (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridizations were performed using denatured 32P-labeled cDNA probes. For 3′-end labeling of the 24-mer 18 S rRNA probe, 5× terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer (0.5 m potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 10 mm CoCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 pmol of 3′-ends (80 ng of DNA of the 24-mer), 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP/μl of reaction volume, and 1 unit/ml terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Invitrogen) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Densitometric analysis was performed using the Scan-Pack II system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Measurement of Phospholipid Hydroperoxides—Lipid hydroperoxides were detected by a modification of the chemiluminescence method described by Yamamoto et al. (44Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 45Yamamoto Y. Frei B. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cells were extracted with 1 ml:2 ml methanol:chloroform containing 20 μl of butylated hydroxytoluene (1 mg/ml), then 1.2 ml of 0.9% saline was added, and the lower layer was collected and dried under nitrogen. The residue was dissolved in ethanol:methanol (80:20), and an appropriate aliquot was injected onto the HPLC system. The isocratic mobile phase (70:25:5 methanol, 2-propanol, 40 mm NaH2PO4) passed through a Spherisorb S5 NH2 column and then through the UV detector (206 nm). The effluent was mixed with the chemiluminescence mixture (1:1 methanol, 55 mm potassium tetraborate, pH 10; 177 mg/liter isoluminol (6-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione, Sigma), 1.5 mg/liter microperoxidase (MP-11, Sigma) at a postcolumn mixing tee, and the emitted light was measured using a chemiluminescence detector (S-3400 Chemilumidetector, Soma Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Separate peaks for PCOOHs and phosphatidylethanolamine hydroperoxides were detected and added as were phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. The data are reported as a ratio of total phospholipid hydroperoxides:phospholipids (μmol/mol) (44Yamamoto Y. Brodsky M.H. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 160: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 45Yamamoto Y. Frei B. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Nuclear Localization of NFκB/Rel Proteins—Accumulation of the NFκB/Rel proteins in the nucleus of control or PHGPx-overexpressing cells after treatment with PCOOHs (10 μm) or UVA light (4 h) was analyzed by the TransAM™ NFκB family transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Transfection with Luciferase Reporter Gene Constructs—p(NFκB)3-Luc refers to a concatenated trimer of the wild-type sequence atgtGGGATTTTCCcatg, while p(T5C)3-Luc corresponds to a three-time repeat with a T-for-C substitution at position 5 (underlined) of the IL-6 + NFκB motif atgtGGGACTTTCCcatg (capital letters indicate the IL-6-NFκB core sequence). The plasmid pCMV-βGal (Clontech) was used as an internal control. Cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106/10-cm dish 24 h prior to transfection. Luciferase reporter plasmids (25 μg) and the pCMV-βGal plasmid (2.5 μg) were cotransfected by FuGENE transfection reagent. Twelve hours after transfection cells were washed twice with PBS and irradiated at a dose of 300 kJ/m2 in PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+). For control purposes, cultures were mock-treated. Luciferase activity was determined in a type 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) using a commercial assay system (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). All transfections were performed in triplicates and assayed at least three times. Western Blotting—Fibroblasts (6× 106 cells/sample) irradiated with UVA light (300 kJ/m2) were collected after 2 or 4 h. Alternatively the cells were stimulated for 2 h with PCOOHs (10 μm) and were collected after an additional 1-h incubation in normal medium. Whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described previously (46Burysek L. Syrovets T. Simmet T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33509-33517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Antibodies against p65 and the phosphorylated forms of p65 (Ser-536 and Ser-276) were used for immunoblotting. For the control of equal protein loading, the blots were reprobed with antibodies directed against either p65 or topoisomerase I. Generation and Characterization of the Fibroblast Cell Line Overexpressing Human PHGPx—The human dermal fibroblast cell line 1306 was transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the cDNA of human PHGPx and a neomycin resistance cassette. Several G418-resistant cell clones were isolated. The PHGPx activity of these clones was 1.5–10-fold increased compared with that of the parental wild-type 1306 cells and 1306 cells transfected with the neomycin resistance expression vector pcDNA3 alone. Clone LPGxA8, revealing the highest (up to 10-fold) increase in PHGPx activity was further studied as indicated. Increased PHGPx expression of clone LPGxA8 did not significantly alter the activities of other antioxidant enzymes including the total superoxide dismutase, catalase, and the glutathione peroxidase (Table I). These results were confirmed by an independent clone (data not shown).Table IActivities of different antioxidant enzymes do not differ in PHGPx-overexpressing cells compared with vector-transfected (V) and parental control (1306 (wt)) cellsPHGPxSODaSuperoxide dismutase.GSHPxbSelenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase.Catalase1306 (wt)0.466 ± 0.125.9 ± 2.03.3 ± 0.334.1 ± 0.6V0.514 ± 0.129.9 ± 0.44.72 ± 0.423.1 ± 0.2PHGPx4.84 ± 0.48cp = 0.0043 compared with vector-transfected control cells (alternate (Welch) t test).31.4 ± 0.84.99 ± 0.294.2 ± 0.6a Superoxide dismutase.b Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase.c p = 0.0043 compared with vector-transfected control cells (alternate (Welch) t test). Open table in a new tab PHGPx Overexpression Confers Protection against UVA Irradiation-induced Increase in Specific mRNA Levels of Matrix Metalloproteinase-1—To study the effect of PHGPx overexpression in cells exposed to UVA irradiation on expression of MMP-1, the PHGPx-overexpressing cell clone LPGxA8 was exposed to UVA irradiation at a dose of 300 kJ/m2 (Fig. 1A). This UVA dose is non-toxic (3Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Poswig A. Briviba K. Oberley T.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25869-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated at different time points (3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h) post-UVA irradiation and subjected to Northern blot analysis. UVA irradiation led to a significant induction of MMP-1 in vector-transfected control cells at 12 h with a maximal induction at 24 h and a subsequent decrease. By contrast, exposure of PHGPx-overexpressing cells to UVA irradiation did not result in any increase in specific MMP-1 mRNA levels at any studied time point compared with UVA light-irradiated vector-transfected control cells. To rule out integration-specific events two independent 3-fold PHGPx-overexpressing cell clones revealed a complete suppression of UVA irradiation-induced MMP-1 mRNA levels compared with induction of specific MMP-1 mRNA levels in vector control cells. No regulation of either β-actin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were observed (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that PHGPx overexpression interferes with UVA irradiation-induced upstream signaling events leading to the suppression of UVA irradiation-induced expression of specific MMP-1 mRNA levels.

https://openalex.org/W1992072898,"A number of missense mutations in the ATP1A2 gene, which encodes the Na,K-ATPase α2 subunit, have been identified in familial hemiplegic migraine with aura. Loss of function and haploinsufficiency have been the suggested mechanisms in mutants for which functional analysis has been reported. This paper describes a kinetic analysis of mutant T345A, recently identified in a detailed genetic analysis of a large Finnish family (Kaunisto, M. A., Harno, H., Vanmolkot, K. R., Gargus, J. J., Sun, G., Hamalainen, E., Liukkonen, E., Kallela, M., van den Maagdenberg, A. M., Frants, R. R., Farkkila, M., Palotie, A., and Wessman, M. (2004) Neurogenetics 5, 141–146). Introducing T345A into the conserved rat α2 enzyme does not alter cell growth or catalytic turnover but causes a substantial decrease in apparent K+ affinity (2-fold increase in K0.5(K+)). In view of the location of Thr-345 in the cytoplasmic stalk domain adjacent to transmembrane segment 4, the 2-fold increase in K0.5(K+) is probably due to T345A replacement altering K+ occlusion/deocclusion. Faster K+ deocclusion of the mutant via the E2(K) + ATP → E1·ATP + K+ partial reaction is evidenced in (i) a marked increase (300%) in K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase at micromolar ATP, (ii) a 4-fold decrease in KATP, and (iii) only a modest increase (∼3-fold) in I50 for vanadate, which was used as a probe of the steady state E1/E2 conformational equilibrium. We suggest that the decreased apparent K+ affinity is the basis for a reduced rate of extracellular K+ removal, which delays the recovery phase of nerve impulse transmission in the central nervous system and, thereby, the clinical picture of migraine with aura. This is the first demonstration of a mutation that leads to a disease associated with a kinetically altered but fully functional Na,K-ATPase, refining the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in familial hemiplegic migraine.

This is the first demonstration of a mutation that leads to a disease associated with a kinetically altered but fully functional Na,K-ATPase, refining the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in familial hemiplegic migraine. Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) 1The abbreviations used are: FHM, familial hemiplegic migraine; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: FHM, familial hemiplegic migraine; WT, wild type; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a rare autosomal dominant form of migraine with aura. This disorder is usually associated with hemiparesis and can be accompanied with clinical features ranging from ataxia to epileptic seizures. This genetically heterogeneous disease has been traced to at least two loci, FHM1 and FHM2. FHM1, which accounts for over 50% of all FHM families, has been traced to chromosome 19p13 and associated with missense mutations in the CACNA1A gene encoding the α1 subunit of the voltage-dependent neuronal (P/Q type) calcium channel. A recent breakthrough in migraine genetics is the discovery of missense mutations in the ATP1A2 gene on chromosome 1q23 that encodes the α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase. This finding gives strong support to the notion that FHM is caused by disruption of normal cation transport. (For a recent update on familial hemiplegic migraine, see Ref. 1Estevez M. Gardner K.L. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar.) The Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein complex that comprises a large catalytic α subunit of ∼110 kDa as well as a smaller, highly glycosylated β subunit that ensures the proper folding and mooring of α in the plasma membrane. This P-type ion pump catalyzes the ATP-driven exchange of intracellular Na+ for extracellular K+ ions across the plasma membrane of virtually all animal cells, with a stoichiometry of 3:2 (for recent reviews, see Refs. 2Kaplan J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 511-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar and 3Jorgensen P.L. Kansson K.O.H. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 817-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Thus, the sodium pump is essential to the maintenance of the electrochemical alkali cation gradients that are tapped by ion channels in the propagation of action potentials. During the course of its catalytic cycle, this P-type ion pump undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of a conserved aspartate residue in the active site of its catalytic subunit. This ion pump also undergoes conformational transitions of dephospho- and phosphoenzyme, commonly referred to as E1 ↔ E2 and E1P ↔ E2P transitions, respectively (see Scheme 1). At present, four isoforms of α and three isoforms of β have been described. Both α and β are distributed in a tissue- and development-dependent manner. In adult mammals, the α2 isoform is located principally in skeletal muscle, and the brain (in particular glial cells), and to a lesser extent in the heart, adipocytes, and the eye (see Refs. 4Sweadner K.J.

Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 763-769PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the α2 enzyme differs from the ubiquitous α1 subunit, primarily in the steady state of the E1/E2 equilibrium. Thus, compared with α1, the E1/E2 poise of α2 is shifted toward E1, and this shift is associated with an ∼2-fold increase in apparent affinity for ATP, a 50% decrease in catalytic turnover, a 3-fold increase in the K+ deocclusion rate, and a 20-fold increase in the I50 for vanadate inhibition of Na,K-ATPase (8Daly S.E.

Marconi R. Silvestri L. Atorino L. Rampoldi L. Morgante L. Ballabio A. Aridon P. Casari G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), an increasing number of mutant alleles of the α2 subunit gene have been identified in families segregating FHM2. However, there have been extremely limited functional studies probing the mechanism by which the proposed pathogenic alleles act. These include L764P and W887R (12De Fusco M. Marconi R. Silvestri L. Atorino L. Rampoldi L. Morgante L. Ballabio A. Aridon P. Casari G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), M731T and R689Q (13Vanmolkot K.R. Kors E.E. Hottenga J.J.

Thus far all alleles are missense, nearly all altering one amino acid in the large catalytic cytosolic loop between M4 and M5. Only the mutant W887R is found outside this domain in the extracellular loop between M7 and M8. No deletions, frameshifts, nonsense, or splice site alleles have been clearly identified. In the first two reported mutations, L764P and W887R, De Fusco et al. (12De Fusco M. Marconi R. Silvestri L. Atorino L. Rampoldi L. Morgante L. Ballabio A. Aridon P. Casari G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) implicate altered sodium pump activity and suggest that the disease is the result of haploinsufficiency because the mutant enzyme does not support the growth of cells in culture. Because the gene was not fully sequenced in this report, and because prior studies of 1q-linked FHM2 failed to reveal causal mutations in the gene (15Keryanov S. Gardner K.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 292: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this functional attribute of the specific mutations was an essential link to ascribing pathogenicity. Although subsequent reports have included complete sequencing of at least all exons to ensure definition of a discrete mutation, none of the other reports of mutant alleles have included any functional analysis, leaving the link between the in vitro pump phenotype and pathogenicity insecure. In initial experiments, we tested the hypothesis that the in vitro growth phenotype would prove a robust means of discriminating the disease-associated alleles by introducing the five aforementioned disease-associated mutations (L764P, W887R, M731T, R689Q, and T345A) into the evolutionarily conserved (∼95% identity) rat α2 enzyme and assessing their abilities to support cell growth. Cells bearing mutants L764P and W887R failed to grow, but the other three alleles supported growth, suggesting that either many alleles were misclassified or that the critical aspect of altered pump function remained to be identified. In this paper we describe a detailed kinetic analysis of the mutant T345A because the previous study (14Kaunisto M.A. Harno H. Vanmolkot K.R. Gargus J.J. Sun G. Hamalainen E. Liukkonen E. Kallela M. van den Maagdenberg A.M. Frants R.R. Farkkila M. Palotie A. Wessman M. Neurogenetics. 2004; 5: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) identified all of the common polymorphisms in the exons and introns of the gene, showing that only the T345A mutation co-segregated with the disorder in a large family in which clinical data were available on 28 family members; the disorder was not present in 132 healthy Finnish control subjects. Mutagenesis, Transfection, and Cell Culture—The T345A, R689Q, M731T, L764P, and W887R mutations of the rat α2 cDNA were derived from the ouabain-insensitive rat α2* 3α2* denotes the relatively ouabain-sensitive rat α2 enzyme (see Ref. 16Jewell E.A.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat α2* cDNA was introduced into a modified pIBI shuttle vector, and mutations were introduced with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Clones containing the correct substitutions were identified by full-length sequencing of the mutated cDNA. The mutant cDNAs were then excised from the shuttle vector with HindIII and ligated into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and orientation was determined by restriction analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with the pcDNA-α2 mutant constructs using the LipofectAMINE™ technique (Invitrogen), and cells expressing the relatively ouabain-resistant rat α enzymes were selected as described previously (16Jewell E.A.

HeLa cells expressing the mutant α2 enzymes were amplified in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% newborn calf serum, 100 units/mg penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μm ouabain as described previously (17Lane L.K.

Growth Curves—Cells were plated (5000 cells/well), grown in 24-well plates, trypsinized for 10 min at 37 °C at the times indicated, and then counted using a hematocytometer. Membrane Preparation and Enzyme Assays—NaI-treated microsomal membranes were prepared from the mutant cells as described previously (16Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol.

To determine maximal Na,K-ATPase activity (as in assays of catalytic turnover) and the effect of inorganic orthovanadate, assays were carried out with final concentrations of 1 mm ATP, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgSO4, 20 mm histidine (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4), and 5 μm ouabain (Sigma). Base-line hydrolysis was determined using 5 mm ouabain. Components of Na,K-ATPase activity were measured as the release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (18Segall L. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35202-35209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Catalytic turnover was estimated from the ratio of Vmax to EPmax as in Ref. 11Segall L. Daly S.E. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31535-31541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Unless indicated otherwise, transport assays were carried out as described by Munzer et al. (19Munzer J.S. Daly S.E. Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16668-16676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were determined by fitting the data to a simple 1-site Michaelis-Menten model (K′ATP), or to a 2-site (K0.5(K+)) or 3-site (K0.5(Na+)) cooperative model, v = Vmax[cat]n/(K + [cat]n where n = 2 or 3 for the cation (cat), either K+ or Na+, respectively. Curve fitting was carried out using the Kaleidagraph computer program (Synergy). All measurements were carried out concurrently on mutant and control (wild-type) α2* enzymes, and each assay was performed in triplicate on at least two separate clones. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Unless indicated otherwise, SDS-PAGE was carried out using 10% NuPage gels (Novex) with SDS/MES (4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid) running buffer. Running and sample buffers were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting to detect α2 was performed with the α2-specific monoclonal antibody McB2, which was kindly provided by Dr. K. Sweadner. In initial experiments, we cloned the full-length cDNA of the rat α2 subunit expressing the T345A, R689Q, M731T, L764P, and W887R substitutions. To distinguish the activity of these exogenous pumps from endogenous pumps in the recipient cell line, mutations Q116R and N127D had been introduced in the first extracellular loop to render them insensitive to ouabain. As first shown by Jewell and Lingrel (16Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wild-type (WT) α2*-transfected cells bearing these mutations can be selected, isolated, and grown in medium that contains ouabain added at low concentration (1 μm) to inhibit the endogenous recipient cell enzyme. Following transfection of T345A, R689Q, M731T, L764P, and W887R, neither L764P nor W887R supported the growth of the cells in 1 μm ouabain, confirming the findings of De Fusco et al. (12De Fusco M. Marconi R. Silvestri L. Atorino L. Rampoldi L. Morgante L. Ballabio A. Aridon P. Casari G. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells transfected with mutants R689Q and M731T, like WT α2*, survived growth in ouabain, although at a markedly reduced rate in the case of R689Q (not shown). Growth of the T345A mutant in ouabain was shown previously by Arguello et al. (20Arguello J.M. Whitis J. Lingrel J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in their mutagenesis study of oxygen containing residues of the Na,K-ATPase. 4T340A in their report, numbered according to the mature NH2-terminal sequence (20Arguello J.M. Whitis J. Lingrel J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In fact, Fig. 1 shows that the growth rates of WT α2* and the T345A are similar. Analysis of protein expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1, inset) indicates that membranes isolated from WT and mutant cells have virtually the same amounts of α2 protein/unit of activity. This indicates that the catalytic turnover is not altered by the T345A mutation. In view of the normal survival of T345A and the particularly clear identification of this mutation as a cause of FHM2 (see the Introduction), we carried out a series of kinetic assays to determine whether the Thr → Ala substitution alters the kinetic behavior of the α2 pump. Na+-, K+-, and ATP-dependent Activation Profiles—The representative experiments in Fig. 2, A and B, show the membrane Na+- and K+-activation profiles of T345A compared with WT α2*. As shown in Fig. 2A, a difference in the Na+-activation profile between the two enzymes could not be detected; K0.5(Na+) is ∼5mm for both. In contrast, the T345A replacement resulted in a 2-fold increase in K0.5(K+) (Fig. 2B) and an ∼4-fold decrease in K′ATP (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that the decrease in apparent affinity for K+ seen in unsided membrane preparations is also seen under more physiological conditions prevailing in intact cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the apparent affinity for extracellular K+ is similarly decreased ∼2-fold by the T345A mutation. Values of K0.5(K+), which are 0.63 and 1.13 mm for WT α2 and the T345A mutant, respectively (Fig. 3), were doubled when the flux experiments were carried out at 100 mm Na+ (experiment not shown).Fig. 3K+ activation of (86Rb+)K+ influx. Transport assays were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with cells equilibrated and assayed at 20 mm Na+ and with varying concentrations of K+ as indicated. Vmax activities of the WT α2 and T345A mutant cells were 36.8 and 47.6 nmol/mg/min, respectively. ○, α2*; ▪, T345A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) K+Sensitivity of Na-ATPase Activity—Because K+ binding/occlusion (Kext + E2P → E2(K) + Pi) precedes K+ deocclusion (E2(K) + ATP → ATP·E1 + Kcyt), a decrease in the latter reaction should be evidenced in an increase in K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase at micromolar ATP concentration with an associated higher apparent affinity for ATP. This is indeed the case, as seen in Fig. 4; the associated decrease in K′ATP was shown above (Fig. 2C). At 1 μm ATP, the maximal K+ stimulation of Na-ATPase of T345A is near 300% compared with 120% for α2*. It is noteworthy that this ∼2.5-fold increase in the percent stimulation is close to that estimated from a simple Michaelis-Menten model, where the ∼4-fold decrease in K′ATP of T345A compared with the WT α2* (Fig. 2C) should affect a similar increase in E2(K) → E1. Sensitivity to Vanadate—To determine whether the relatively faster E2(K) → E1 sequence of T345A results in a shift in steady-state E1/E2 poise toward E1, we compared the vanadate sensitivities of the WT and T345A mutants. Inorganic orthovanadate is a transition-state analog of inorganic phosphate that binds to P-type ATPases in the E2 conformation during steady state catalysis. Thus, Na,K-ATPase sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate is a measure of the proportion of enzyme in the E2 state. In the representative experiment shown in Fig. 5, I50 (μm) values were 6.40 ± 0.75 μm and 20.09 ± 0.40 μm for α2* and α2T345A, respectively. Because this shift is relatively small, it is not surprising that the T345A mutation did not significantly affect catalytic turnover measured as either the ratio of Vmax/EPmax (not shown) or the ratio of immunoreactive α2 protein/unit of activity (Fig. 1). The identification of ATP1A2 as a causative gene in FHM2 is a major discovery in migraine genetics and has underscored the relevance of ion transport dysfunction to the pathophysiology of migraine. An increasing number of missense mutations in ATP1A2 that likely cause FHM2 are being identified, including L764P and W887R (12De Fusco M. Marconi R. Silvestri L. Atorino L. Rampoldi L. Morgante L.

Several others await validation (21Jurkat-Rott K. Freilinger T. Dreier J.P. Herzog J. Gobel H. Petzold G.C. Montagna P. Gasser T. Lehmann-Horn F. Dichgans M. Neurology. 2004; 62: 1857-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For at least two mutations (L764P and W887R), loss of function and haploinsufficiency are the suggested underlying defects based on a cell growth phenotype. However, because a myriad of critical physiological processes (from cell volume regulation to sodium gradient-dependent transport to the Nernst potentials for Na+ and K+ and their influence upon membrane potentials) all ultimately rely on normal pump function, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying FHM2 remains unresolved. In this study, we performed a detailed kinetic analysis of the T345A mutant pump cycle to reveal qualitative and quantitative changes associated with the disease allele, bringing focus to its reduced affinity for extracellular K+. We also demonstrate that the growth phenotype may not be capable of discriminating many pathogenic alleles. It is clear that the growth rate of T345A-transfected HeLa cells is as high as WT control and that the T345A mutant enzyme is fully active, with no reduction in catalytic turnover (Vmax/EPmax). The glial cells that abundantly express the α2 isoform of the sodium pump have the key role in determining the resting extracellular K+ concentration bathing neurons in the brain. This concentration directly alters EK+ and thereby the magnitude of neurons' after-hyperpolarizations and rates of repolarization and pacing (22Ransom C.B. Ransom B.R. Sontheimer H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 427-442Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23D'Ambrosio R. Gordon D.S. Winn H.R. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the lowered apparent affinity for extracellular K+ affected by the T345A mutation should slow removal of K+ from the extracellular space and thereby slow the recovery from neuronal excitation. It is noteworthy that the K0.5(K+) values at a resting membrane potential of –70 mV may be even higher (∼35%) (see Fig. 5B in Ref. 24Horisberger J.D. Kharoubi-Hess S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 669-680Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar.) than in the depolarized state (the conditions of the present study with porous membranes). The change in K+ handling is thus a likely explanation for the altered cortical spreading depression in migraine associated with aura as hypothesized by Lauritzen (25Lauritzen M. Brain. 1994; 117: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). We suggest that the decreased removal of extracellular K+ during the recovery phase of nerve impulse transmission is probably the critical manifestation of altered pump function that leads to disease. This may arise because of either a decrease in pump number (L764P and W887R) or a decrease in apparent affinity for extracellular K+ (T345A). In an earlier analysis of the heterozygous α2 knock-out mouse, Moseley et al. (26Moseley A.E. Lieske S.P. Wetzel R.K. James P.F. He S. Shelly D.A. Paul R.J. Boivin G.P. Witte D.P. Ramirez J.M. Sweadner K.J. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5317-5324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) had similarly suggested that impaired clearance of extracellular K+ resulting from a loss of α2 function affects neuronal excitability in both neurons and glia. Under physiological conditions of high extracellular Na+ concentration, the apparent affinity of the T345A mutant for K+ is lowered sufficiently (see under “Results”). This delays the normal rate of recovery of extracellular K+ from values well above saturation to the resting level (3 mm) following action potential repolarization (27Xiong Z.Q. Stringer J.L. Brain Res. 2000; 122: 113-117Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is less likely that the primary disease-causing effect of the T345A mutation results from altered subcellular localization or delivery to the plasma membrane rather than the kinetic effect on K+ affinity. Our experiments with intact cells indicate that the mutation neither decreases cell growth nor diminishes cell surface expression as evidenced in Vmax of pump flux measured with intact cells (see legend to Fig. 3). Decreased activity of α2 effected by either haploinsufficiency or reduced apparent K+ affinity may alter the Na+ gradient. As proposed by James et al. (28James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), if the α2 pump and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger are co-localized in microdomains of the same cell (astrocyte), a localized rise in cell Na+ (caused by the decreased K0.5(K+)) would increase intracellular Ca2+ because of decreased Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity. Increased cell Ca2+ may, in turn, affect Ca2+-dependent processes in regions critical to the pathogenesis of migraine (cf. Ref. 1Estevez M. Gardner K.L. Hum. Genet. 2004; 114: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The T345A replacement likely decreases apparent K+ affinity by directly affecting the cation binding pocket. Although the cation binding sites of the sodium pump are located within the transmembrane segments, earlier studies, such as our H,K/Na,K-ATPase chimera experiments, showed that a portion of the M4-M5 loop juxtaposed to the stalk segment leading to M4-affected cation selectivity (29Blostein R. Dunbar L. Mense M. Scanzano R. Wilczynska A. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18374-18381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, based on the alignment of the amino acid sequence of the Na,K-ATPase with the homologous sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump and with a known crystal structure, Thr-345 is located in stalk segment 4 within three residues of the plasma membrane (30Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar, 31Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), at least in the E1 conformational state. In addition, M4 has an important role in the formation of the cation binding pocket and undergoes a notable rearrangement during the course of large cytoplasmic domain movements that accompany rearrangement of the transmembrane helices. As the enzyme shifts from E1 to E2, M4 moves a distance equivalent to one turn of an α-helix toward the extracellular space, consequently pulling Thr-345 into the lipid bilayer. (For a review of structural changes in conformational shifts, see Ref. 32Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Sugita Y. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar.) Homology modeling of the Na,K-ATPase onto the structure of the sarco-(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase pump has revealed that the residues involved in K+ ligation are similar to those involved in Ca2+ binding (33Ogawa H. Toyoshima C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15977-15982Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For the Na,K-ATPase, the residues of M4 involved in the formation of “site II” are similar for Na+ and K+, with the exception of Glu-332. Although Glu-332 directly coordinates Na+, it may only coordinate K+ via a water molecule. It is attractive to hypothesize that increased hydrophobicity created by the T345A replacement may interfere with the normal displacement of M4, thereby weakening the coordination of K+ ions at site II, consequently decreasing the intrinsic binding affinity for extracellular K+. There is an important difference in the nature of the functional change affected by T345A and mutations whose primary effect is a shift in steady state E1/E2 poise in favor of E1. One example is an E233K substitution in α1 (34Daly S.E. Blostein R. Lane L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6341-6347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whereas E233K and T345A replacements result in similar changes in K′ATP and K+ sensitivity to Na+-ATPase measured at micromolar ATP, E233K has no effect on K0.5(K+) but markedly shifts the E1/E2 poise toward E1 (as seen in the 250-fold increase in I50 for vanadate) and significantly decreases catalytic turnover. The T345A substitution, on the other hand, increases K0.5(K+) but does not alter catalytic turnover and minimally shifts the E1/E2 poise as evidenced in the relatively small (∼3-fold) effect of vanadate. Our analysis strongly supports the notion that the T345A mutation primarily alters intrinsic interactions of K+ with its binding pocket. Here we report that the T345A missense FHM2 mutation leads to a fully active but functionally altered pump with reduced affinity for K+. Although this is a firm, physiological foundation for understanding how this mutation may lead to disease, the challenge for the future is to integrate the consequences of functional pump lesions with the consequences of the large number of FHM1 mutations now recognized in the CACNA1A calcium channel gene, both of which produce a nearly identical phenotype in humans.

https://openalex.org/W1986608067,"We constructed a complete panel of alanine mutants of the insect-specific calcium channel blocker ω-atracotoxin-Hv1a. Lethality assays using these mutant toxins identified three spatially contiguous residues, Pro10, Asn27, and Arg35, that are critical for insecticidal activity against flies (Musca domestica) and crickets (Acheta domestica). Competitive binding assays using radiolabeled ω-atracotoxin-Hv1a and neuronal membranes prepared from the heads of American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) confirmed the importance of these three residues for binding of the toxin to target calcium channels presumably expressed in the insect membranes. At concentrations up to 10 μm, ω-atracotoxin-Hv1a had no effect on heterologously expressed rat Cav2.1, Cav2.2, and Cav1.2 calcium channels, consistent with the previously reported insect selectivity of the toxin. 30 μm ω-atracotoxin-Hv1a inhibited rat Cav currents by 10-34%, depending on the channel subtype, and this low level of inhibition was essentially unchanged when Asn27 and Arg35, which appears to be critical for interaction of the toxin with insect Cav channels, were both mutated to alanine. We propose that the spatially contiguous epitope formed by Pro10, Asn27, and Arg35 confers specific binding to insect Cav channels and is largely responsible for the remarkable phyletic selectivity of ω-atracotoxin-Hv1a.

These toxins comprise 36-37 residues with six strictly conserved cysteine residues that are paired to form three disulfide bridges (4Tedford H.W. Sollod B.L. Maggio F. King G.F. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The best studied family member, ω-ACTX-Hv1a, is one of the most potent insecticidal peptide toxins discovered so far (4Tedford H.W. Sollod B.L. Maggio F. King G.F.

The phyletic specificity of these toxins appears to reside in their ability to block insect, but not vertebrate, voltage-gated calcium channels (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M.

I., and Vonarx, E. J. (June 9, 1998) U. S. Patent 5,763,568Google Scholar). With the exception of the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides (which target acetylcholinesterase), the vast majority of synthetic insecticides are directed against voltage-gated sodium channels, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or GABA/glutamate-gated chloride channels. This limited group of targets has promoted the evolution of cross-resistance to different families of insecticides (6Brogdon W.G. McAllister J.C. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1998; 4: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and stimulated interest in the development of new insecticides that act on targets outside of this established ion channel triumvirate (7Maggio F. Sollod B.L. Tedford H.W. King G.F. Gilbert L.I. Iatrou K. Gill S. Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. Elsevier, 2004Google Scholar). Although blockers of HVA calcium currents have evolved independently in the venoms of cone snails, snakes, and spiders (4Tedford H.W. Sollod B.L. Maggio F. King G.F.

Thus, ω-ACTX-Hv1a is a valuable lead for the development of a new class of insecticides that target insect calcium channels. The three-dimensional structure of ω-ACTX-Hv1a comprises a disulfide-rich globular core (residues 4-21), with residues 22-37 forming a finger-like β hairpin that protrudes from this globular region (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In a previous structure-activity relationship study, we demonstrated the functional significance of several residues in the toxin's β hairpin (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study, we extended our scanning mutagenesis of ω-ACTX-Hv1a in several ways: first, we employed a complete panel of alanine mutations representing all solvent-exposed side chains of the toxin structure; second, we tested these mutations using lethality assays performed in two distantly related insects, the orthopteran Acheta domestica and the dipteran Musca domestica; third, by performing competitive binding assays using a neuronal membrane preparation from the head of P. americana,we obtained information about the toxin-target interaction that is not complicated by issues of bioavailability and/or pharmacokinetics. The data indicate that a spatially contiguous epitope composed of residues Pro10, Asn27, and Arg35 is responsible for the specific interaction of this toxin with insect calcium channels. A panel of follow-up mutants was used to ascertain the key chemical features of these residues that are critical for the toxin-channel interaction. This information should facilitate the rational design of chemical insecticides based on the structure of ω-ACTX-Hv1a. Production of ω-ACTX-Hv1a Mutants—Individual point mutations were introduced into a synthetic gene encoding ω-ACTX-Hv1a as described previously (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol.

The full-length product of the mutagenic PCR was then digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T as described previously for pHWT-1 (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Double mutations were introduced by a similar process in which a version of pHWT-1 encoding one of the two desired mutations was used as the PCR template. Overexpression and purification of recombinant wild-type (WT) ω-ACTX-Hv1a and mutants thereof was performed as described previously using glutathione affinity chromatography followed by C18 reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (11Tedford H.W.

The identity of each toxin was confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. Insect Toxicity Assays—Insecticidal activity was tested as described previously (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F.

LD50 values (i.e. the dose that is lethal to 50% of insects) were calculated as described previously (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the reported values are the mean of two to three independent experiments. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of ω-ACTX-Hv1a or mutants thereof were collected and processed as described previously using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The toxin concentration was 15 μm. Radiolabeling of Recombinant ω-ACTX-Hv1a—Lethality assays performed with crickets showed that although mutation of Tyr to Phe at residue 13 of ω-ACTX-Hv1a was not deleterious, other mutations at this residue (such as Tyr to Trp or Ala) can lower toxin activity (see “Results”). Hence, Tyr13 is not a good target for iodination. Because the initial alanine scan of the β-hairpin region of ω-ACTX-Hv1a (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that an F24A mutation was tolerated, we decided to engineer a “YF swap mutant,” in which Tyr13 was mutated to Phe and Phe24 was mutated to Tyr, for use as a radioiodination substrate. The swap mutant was fully functional in LD50 assays and it contained a single, non-critical Tyr residue (Tyr24) that allowed radioactive iodine to be conjugated to residue 24 rather than to residue 13. Radioiodination of the YF swap mutant was performed as described previously for ω-conotoxin GVIA (14Favreau P. Gilles N. Lamthanh H. Bournaud R. Shimahara T. Bouet F. Laboute P. Letourneux Y.

The purification was performed using a Vydac C18 analytical reverse-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm; 5 μm pore size) eluted at 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0-28% buffer B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile in water) in buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) over 5 min, followed by a linear gradient of 28-35% buffer B in buffer A over 15 min, followed by a linear gradient of 35-53% buffer B in buffer A over 12 min. Cold toxin was observed to elute at 19 min (i.e. during the last minute of the second gradient); monoiodinated toxin was observed to elute at 21-22 min. Hereinafter, the radiolabeled swap mutant will be referred to as 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a. Preparation of Cockroach Neuronal Membranes—Neuronal membranes were prepared from the heads of adult P. americana as described previously (15Krimm I. Gilles N. Sautiere P. Stankiewicz M. Pelhate M. Gordon D. Lancelin J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1749-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except that the final Ficoll centrifugation step was eliminated. The concentration of membrane proteins in the final preparation was determined using a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Competitive Binding Assays using Radiolabeled ω-ACTX-Hv1a—Equilibrium competition binding experiments were performed using increasing concentrations of unlabeled mutant toxin in the presence of a fixed concentration of 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a. Individual binding reactions were brought to a final volume of 100 μl in binding buffer (75 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Cockroach neuronal membranes were added to binding reactions to a final concentration of ∼0.15 μg of membrane protein/μl. 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a was added to a final concentration of 1-1.5 nm. Unlabeled competitors were present at various final concentrations. After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, the reactions were terminated by dilution with 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (300 mm choline chloride, 5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Bound toxin was recovered from the diluted reactions using rapid vacuum filtration through GF/C filters (Whatman) preincubated in 0.3% polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich). The filters were then rapidly washed three times with 2 ml of wash buffer. Nonspecific toxin binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled ω-ACTX-Hv1a and typically comprised 40-50% of total binding. Counts of the washed filters were analyzed using KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck/Synergy, Reading, PA) to fit data to a non-linear Hill equation for IC50 determination. Ki values were calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (which assumes pure competition at a single site), Ki = IC50/[1 + (L*/Kd)], where L* is the concentration of radiolabeled toxin and Kd is its dissociation constant (16Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar). The Kd value used for these computations was obtained by using the computer program LIGAND (Elsevier Biosoft) to perform iterative Scatchard analysis on data from competition binding experiments performed with 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a and unlabeled wild-type ω-ACTX-Hv1a. Patch-clamp Recordings—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) tsA-201 cells were grown and transfected with cDNAs encoding α1, α2-δ, and β subunits of rat HVA calcium channels as described previously (17Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were acquired from the transiently transfected tsA-201 cells as described previously (17Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2939-2948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis of ω-ACTX-Hv1a—We expanded a collection of described previously alanine mutants of ω-ACTX-Hv1a (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to give a larger panel of 28 mutants that comprised individual alanine mutations at all positions corresponding to solvent-exposed non-glycine sidechains of the toxin. The six cysteine residues that form the toxin's cystine-knot motif (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10King G.F. Tedford H.W. Maggio F. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 2002; 21: 359-389Crossref Google Scholar) were excluded from the mutational analysis because their side chains are involved in disulfide bonds that are critical to the three-dimensional structure of the toxin. Ile5 was excluded because it forms part of the buried hydrophobic core of the toxin (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and is likely to be critical for toxin folding. Gly8 and Gly30 were also excluded because they are located in β-turns that are likely to be structurally important (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, with only a hydrogen atom side chain, the Gly residues are unlikely to be functionally important. The P6A and S19A mutant toxins were difficult to overexpress and purify, and were therefore not used in the fly toxicity assays. Structural Integrity of Mutant Toxins—Although the mutations that we introduced into ω-ACTX-Hv1a were chosen to avoid major structural perturbations, it was important to test this experimentally. We did this by acquiring CD spectra of the WT and mutant recombinant toxins. The CD spectrum of WT toxin exhibits a β sheet signature (Fig. 1A) with pronounced minima and maxima at 210 and 196 nm, respectively (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); this is consistent with a 16-residue β hairpin (residues 22-37) being the major secondary structure feature of ω-ACTX-Hv1a (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). The small positive band at 236 nm is presumably caused by the aromatic chromophore of Tyr13, since this feature is absent in CD spectra of Y13A and Y13L mutants but present (albeit slightly blue-shifted) in the spectrum of a Y13W mutant (Fig. 1B). We showed previously that none of the alanine-scan mutants in the β-hairpin region of the toxin were structurally perturbed except for mutations at Lys34 (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, the CD spectrum of 13 of the 15 newly constructed alanine mutants in the disulfide-rich globular portion of the toxin superimposed closely on the CD spectrum of the WT recombinant toxin, as illustrated for the S1A and Q9A mutants in Fig. 1A. Only the CD spectra of the Y13A and N16A mutants differed significantly from that of the WT toxin. The CD spectrum of the Y13A mutant was similar to that of the WT toxin except that the Tyr13 side chain signature at 236 nm was absent as expected (Fig. 1B). We conclude that the backbone fold of the Y13A mutant is similar to that of the native toxin. We were surprised to find that the presumed Tyr13 side chain signature was also absent in the N16A mutant (Fig. 1A). This suggests that the conformation of this mutant is perturbed in a manner that significantly alters the chemical environment of the Tyr13 side chain chromophore. Asn16 lies within a rare triple turn motif formed by three overlapping type I β turns (residues 13-16, 14-17, and 17-20) (2Fletcher J.I. Smith R. O'Donoghue S.I. Nilges M. Connor M. Howden M.E.H. Christie M.J. King G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Asn16 is found at the i+2 position of the second turn, where Asn and Asp are by far the most favored residues (18Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In contrast, alanine is one of the least favored residues at this position in type I β turns (18Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Thus, an N16A mutation might abrogate this β turn, thereby disrupting the entire set of interconnected β turns in the triple turn system and substantially altering the environment of the Tyr13 side chain. We therefore suspect that the small reduction in cricket toxicity observed for the N16A mutant (see below) is the result of a perturbation of the toxin structure in the region of the triple turn (residues 13-20). However, for all other alanine mutants, we can rule out the possibility that functional defects are caused by major structural perturbations. Cricket Bioassays—The insecticidal potency of each mutant was initially examined by comparing its LD50 in a model orthopteran (house crickets) with that of WT recombinant toxin (Fig. 1D). Based on the reasoning described previously (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we considered mutated residues to be functionally significant if the LD50 of the mutant toxin was more than 4-fold greater than that of WT toxin, potentially significant if the corresponding LD50 was 2-4-fold greater than that of WT toxin, or otherwise insignificant. We were surprised to find, based on these criteria, that only Gln9 and Pro10 were identified as functionally significant residues for activity against crickets (Fig. 1D), in addition to the β-hairpin residues Asn27 and Arg35 that were identified in our previous structure-activity relationship study (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Residues Tyr13 and Asn16 were identified as potentially significant for cricket toxicity (Fig. 1D). Fly Bioassays—We expanded the toxicity assays to include a model dipteran (house flies) for several reasons. First, dipterans are the most pernicious insects from a human and animal health perspective, being responsible for the transmission of malaria, filariasis, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and numerous arboviral diseases (4Tedford H.W. Sollod B.L. Maggio F. King G.F. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Maggio F. Sollod B.L. Tedford H.W. King G.F. Gilbert L.I. Iatrou K. Gill S. Comprehensive Molecular Insect Science. Elsevier, 2004Google Scholar). Thus, it was of interest to establish whether ω-ACTX-Hv1a might serve as a lead for development of insecticides directed against dipteran vectors of human disease. Second, although some venomous animals such as cone snails are specialist predators, spiders are mostly generalists that prey on a wide range of invertebrates and sometimes small vertebrates. Thus, there would be selective advantage for spiders that evolved venoms capable of dealing with subtle variations in ion channel targets between different insects, in addition to the intraspecific complexity introduced by the high degree of differential splicing and editing of transcripts encoding channel subunits (19Hoopengardner B. Bhalla T. Staber C. Reenan R. Science. 2003; 301: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 20Zamponi G.W. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2004; 41: 3-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One evolutionary response to this problem seems to have been lineage-specific gene duplication events that created a suite of closely related paralogous toxins (21Sollod B.L. Wilson D. Zhaxybayeva O. Gogarten J.P. Drinkwater R. King G.F. Peptides. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). However, an alternative possibility is that a single toxin encodes both a core pharmacophore that is crucial for interaction with the target plus additional residues that are critical contributors to channel binding in some insect species but not others. To address this latter possibility, we sought to examine whether the insect-active epitope of ω-ACTX-Hv1a was invariant between two highly divergent insect orders (i.e. Diptera and Orthoptera) or whether certain residues might be important for activity in one of these orders but not the other. Finally, we were surprised that the cricket toxicity assays seemed to indicate that the insect-active epitope of ω-ACTX-Hv1a comprises only a few residues, thus raising the possibility that variations in toxin bioavailability/pharmacokinetics might be masking variations in channel-blocking activity of the mutant toxins. That is, in the LD50 assays, the activity of a toxin depends not only on its intrinsic affinity for the target channel but also on its in vivo stability and its ability to penetrate anatomical barriers. The latter point is crucial in that ω-ACTX-Hv1a targets the central nervous system of insects (4Tedford H.W. Sollod B.L. Maggio F. King G.F. Toxicon. 2004; 43: 601-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Bloomquist J.R. Invertebr. Neurosci. 2003; 5: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas most other spider toxins act presynaptically at insect neuromuscular junctions. Thus, a mutant toxin might have reduced activity not because of a reduced affinity for the target channel, but rather because of increased susceptibility to proteolysis or more limited access to the central nervous system. We anticipated that these potential problems would be less critical in the smaller house flies as they responded more rapidly than crickets to toxin injection, suggesting that anatomical barriers are less critical, and they were about 3-fold more sensitive to the toxin (LD50 = 86.5 ± 1.3 pmol/g) than crickets (LD50 = 269 ± 13 pmol/g). Fig. 1E shows the insecticidal potency of each alanine mutant in house flies relative to the activity of the WT recombinant toxin. As for the cricket bioassays, residues Pro10, Asn27, and Arg35 were found to be functionally critical; each individual mutation caused a 10-20-fold reduction in LD50. In contrast, Gln9 and all residues identified as potentially significant in the cricket assays (Tyr13, Asn16, Asn29, Lys34, and Asp37) seemed unimportant for activity against flies. An N27A,R35A double-mutant toxin (11Tedford H.W. Fletcher J.I. King G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26568-26576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that carried mutations in two of the three residues most critical for insecticidal activity had a 60-fold higher LD50 in house flies than WT recombinant toxin (data not shown). Competitive Binding Assays—We developed a competitive binding assay to study the interaction between ω-ACTX-Hv1a and its presumed calcium channel target in a manner not complicated by issues of pharmacokinetics and bioavailability. This assay measured the ability of cold ω-ACTX-Hv1a and alanine mutants thereof to displace the radiolabeled tracer 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a from neuronal membranes prepared from the heads of adult cockroaches. The assay was complicated by what seemed to be very high and inconsistent nonspecific binding of 125I-ω-ACTX-Hv1a to the membrane preparation, a problem that could not be resolved through any modification of the assay conditions tested (i.e. using more or less toxin per binding reaction, more or less membrane preparation per binding reaction, additional washes, etc.). We presume this problem stems from two issues: 1) the low total number of ω-ACTX-Hv1a binding sites (Bmax = 0.5-1.0 pmol/mg), consistent with the expected low density of vol"

To use extracellular sources of this class of compounds as osmo-, cryo-, or thermoprotectants, Bacteria and Archaea have developed high affinity uptake systems of the ATP-binding cassette type. These transport systems require periplasmic- or extracellular-binding proteins that are able to bind the transported substance with high affinity. Therefore, binding proteins that bind compatible solutes have to avoid the exclusion of their ligands within the binding pocket. In the present study we addressed the question to how compatible solutes can be effectively bound by a protein at temperatures around 83 °C as this is done by the ligand-binding protein ProX from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus. We solved the structures of ProX without ligand and in complex with both of its natural ligands glycine betaine and proline betaine, as well as in complex with the artificial ligand trimethylammonium. Cation-π interactions and non-classical hydrogen bonds between four tyrosine residues, a main chain carbonyl oxygen, and the ligand have been identified to be the key determinants in binding the quaternary amines of the three investigated ligands. The comparison of the ligand binding sites of ProX from A. fulgidus and the recently solved structure of ProX from Escherichia coli revealed a very similar solution for the problem of compatible solute binding, although both proteins share only a low degree of sequence identity.

Variations in the supply of water and the concomitant changes in salinity and osmolarity are among the most important environmental parameters affecting the growth of microorganisms (1Csonka L.N.

Because bacteria lack systems to actively transport water across the cytoplasmic membrane, osmotic processes solely determine their intracellular water content. This requires an active adjustment of their intracellular solute pool to prevent dehydration under hypertonic growth conditions and bursting under hypotonic circumstances (6Booth I.R. Louis P. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To retain a suitable level of cellular water and to maintain turgor within a physiologically acceptable range under high osmolarity growth conditions, many bacterial species accumulate large amounts of a particular class of organic osmolytes, the so called compatible solutes. This can be accomplished either through synthesis or uptake from the environment (2Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 15: 95-108Crossref Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 3Kempf B.

Compatible solutes are non-interfering with cellular functions and can be amassed up to molar concentrations in the cytoplasm without disturbing essential cellular processes and the functioning of cell components (7Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Important representatives of compatible solutes are the trimethylammonium compound glycine betaine (GB, N,N,N-trimethylglycine) 1The abbreviations used are: GB, glycine betaine; PB, proline betaine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TM, trimethylammonium; r.m.s., root mean square.1The abbreviations used are: GB, glycine betaine; PB, proline betaine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TM, trimethylammonium; r.m.s., root mean square. and the dimethylammonium compound proline betaine (PB, N,N-dimethyl-l-proline). The intracellular accumulation of compatible solutes as a strategy for adaptation to high osmolarity has been widely adopted not only by Bacteria (2Galinski E.A. Trüper H.G. FEMS Microbiol.

In addition to their well established role as osmoprotectants, compatible solutes also function as protein stabilizers both in vitro (19Canovas D. Borges N. Vargas C. Ventosa A. Nieto J.J. Santos H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1050-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The exact biological mechanism(s) by which these compounds affect protein stability is not completely understood, but their functioning is generally explained in terms of the preferential exclusion model (23Arakawa T. Timasheff S.N. Biochem. J. 1985; 47: 411-414Scopus (826) Google Scholar). This hypothesis predicts that compatible solutes are excluded from the immediate hydration shell of proteins, presumably because of their unfavorable interactions with protein surfaces (24Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 25Qu Y. Bolen C.L. Bolen D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9268-9273Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The resulting disequilibrium provides a thermodynamic force to minimize the surface of the protein to reduce the amount of hydration water and thereby stabilizes the native structure of proteins and favors the formation of protein assemblies. An experimental confirmation of this behavior came from neutron diffraction studies (26Lehmann M.S. Zaccai G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1939-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ability of compatible solutes to stabilize proteins probably also explains their in vivo function as microbial stress protectants against heat and chill stress (5Welsh D.T. FEMS Microbiol.

One example of such a glycine betaine transporter is the ProU system from Escherichia coli (34Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lucht J.M. Bremer E.

In the meantime, several Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms have been shown to contain homologues of the E. coli ProU glycine betaine transport system. Recently, we have identified such a ProU-type glycine betaine uptake system in Archaeoglobus fulgidus. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results.2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results.A. fulgidus is a sulfate-reducing archaeon with an optimal growth temperature of 83 °C. This hyperthermophilic microorganism was originally isolated from hot sediments of a marine hydrothermal vent system (38Stetter K.O. Lauerer G. Thomm M. Neuner A. Science. 1987; 236: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Marine sediments are known to contain glycine betaine (39Ghoul M. Bernard T. Cormier M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1990; 56: 551-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the concentration of this compatible solute in natural settings is likely to be very low and variable. In this habitat, microorganisms need an effective uptake route to scavenge the compatible solute from very dilute solutions at high temperatures. As deduced from the genome sequence of A. fulgidus strain VC16 (40Klenk H.-P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.-F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L.

In general substrate-binding proteins bind their ligand(s) selectively and with high affinity, which is thought to ensure the substrate specificity and directionality of the overall transport reaction for a given binding protein-dependent transport system (36Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhard F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella, Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). Binding proteins of binding protein-dependent ABC transporters are composed of two domains connected by one to three polypeptide chains forming a hinge between them. In the ligand-free open conformation the two rigid domains are flexibly linked by the hinge (41Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This has been shown by the structural analysis of various open states of the ribose-binding protein and d-allose-binding protein (42Magnusson U. Chaudhuri B.N. Ko J. Park C. Jones A. Mowbray S.L. J.

Biol. 1998; 279: 651-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Ligand binding induces a large conformational change in the hinge region that moves both domains toward each other. After this domain rearrangement, the ligand is engulfed in a predefined cleft between the two domains, which refers to the closed conformation of the binding protein. Inspection of the proX sequence from A. fulgidus (40Klenk H.-P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.-F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R.

Heterologous overproduction of the ProX protein in a soluble form in E. coli and its subsequent purification allowed us to assess the biochemical properties of this ligand-binding protein. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results. Substrate binding assays with radiolabeled glycine betaine and competition experiments with other compatible solutes revealed that ProX binds both GB and PB with high affinity and specificity at room temperature with an apparent KD of 60 and 50 nm, respectively. GB and PB are well known osmoprotectants for many microbial species (10da Costa M.S. Santos H. Galinski E.A. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 1998; 61: 117-153PubMed Google Scholar), but both do not have this function in A. fulgidus. A. fulgidus is not able to grow in a mineral salt-based medium lacking yeast extract at 90 °C; however, both GB and PB could rescue its growth to a large extent at this elevated temperature. Consequently, both compatible solutes serve as effective thermoprotectants for the hyperthermophilic archaeon A. fulgidus. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results. The amino acid sequences of the ligand-binding proteins ProX from E. coli (34Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ProX from A. fulgidus (40Klenk H.-P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 5588-5596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) are not conserved in ProX from A. fulgidus. To broaden our understanding of the specific interactions of ligand-binding proteins with compatible solutes, we solved the structure of ProX from A. fulgidus without ligand and in complex with its natural ligands GB and PB as well as the artificial ligand trimethylammonium. This allowed us to trace the structural rearrangements that occur upon ligand binding and permitted the identification of the amino acid residues that are involved in the high affinity binding of the ligands GB and PB within the binding pocket. Bacterial Strains—The E. coli strain BL21 (Codon Plus RIL), which harbors a plasmid encoding rare tRNAs for arginine, isoleucine, and leucine, was purchased from Stratagene (Heidelberg, Germany) and used for the heterologous overproduction of the A. fulgidus ProX protein. Without the presence of the Codon Plus RIL plasmid in strain BL21 there was no substantial production of the ProX protein. The proX+ overexpression plasmid pGH26 was introduced by electrotransformation into strain BL21 (Codon Plus RIL). The resulting transformants were propagated in the presence of both ampicillin (150 μgml-1) and chloramphenicol (30 μg ml-1) to simultaneously select for pGH26 (AmpR) and the Codon Plus RIL plasmid (CmlR). The recombinant strain was propagated on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (45Miller J.H. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Overproduction and Purification of the Recombinant A. fulgidus ProX Protein—To overproduce the A. fulgidus ProX protein in E. coli, we used the proX+ plasmid pGH26. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results. This plasmid is a derivative of the expression vector pASK-IBA6 (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) that carries an anhydrotetracycline-inducible tet promoter allowing selective proX gene expression. pGH26 carries the proX gene from A. fulgidus strain VC16 (40Klenk H.-P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.-F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R. Graham D.E. Kyrpides N.C. Fleischmann R.D. Quackenbush J.

Science. 1987; 236: 822-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) as a 869-bp PCR fragment flanked by BsaI restriction sites. In A. fulgidus, the authentic ProX protein is likely to be a lipoprotein that is acylated at its N-terminal cysteine residue allowing its anchoring into the cytoplasmic membrane. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results. To overproduce the ProX protein in a soluble form in E. coli, the proX gene present in pGH26 is engineered in such a way that it lacks its own signal sequence and the N-terminal cysteine residue of the mature ProX protein is replaced by a glycine to avoid a lipid modification of the soluble protein. The proX coding sequence for the mature A. fulgidus ProX was inserted into the expression vector pASK-IBA6 in-frame with an upstream located OmpA signal sequence and a Strep-Tag affinity peptide. This construction allows the secretion of the ProX protein into the periplasm of E. coli and its recovery in a soluble form via affinity chromatography. We observed that a substantial portion of the ProX protein heterologously produced in E. coli still carried an unprocessed OmpA signal sequence. 2G. Holtmann and E. Bremer, unpublished results. To remove both the unprocessed OmpA signal sequence and the Strep-Tag affinity tag from the recombinant A. fulgidus ProX, the protein preparation was treated with the protease factor Xa using the cleavage site of the pASK-IBA6 vector between the Strep-Tag and ProX. This method yielded soluble ProX protein without any N-terminal extensions and the amino acid sequence starting with a glycine residue instead of a cysteine residue. The nucleotide sequence of the A. fulgidus proX gene in pGH26 was verified by DNA sequence analysis (46Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52494) Google Scholar) using a set of synthetic oligonucleotide primers appropriately spaced along the proX coding region. Rich media (e.g. yeast extract) frequently contain GB (47Dulaney E.L. Dulaney D.D. Rickes E.L. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1968; 9: 260-269Google Scholar). To obtain A. fulgidus ProX preparations that were free of its ligands GB and PB, the overproducing strain BL21 (Codon Plus RIL) (pGH26) was grown in a chemically defined minimal medium (45Miller J.H. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). A 10-liter flask containing 5 liters of minimal medium supplemented with 150 μg ml-1 ampicillin, 30 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol, 0.5% (w/v) glucose as the carbon source, and 0.2%(w/v) casamino acids was inoculated to an A578 of 0.1 from an overnight culture prepared in the same growth medium. The cells were grown at 37 °C with vigorous stirring until the culture had reached mid-exponential phase (A578 0.5–0.8). Increased transcription of the proX gene from the plasmid-encoded tet promoter in pGH26 was then induced by the addition of anhydrotetracycline (final concentration 0.2 μg ml-1). Cells were grown for 2 more hours to allow ProX production and were subsequently harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3000 × g). To release the periplasmic proteins from the ProX-overproducing E. coli cells, the cell paste was resuspended in 50 ml of ice-cold buffer P (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) to allow the formation of spheroplasts. After 30 min incubation on ice, the spheroplasts were separated from the periplasmic protein extract by centrifugation (15 min, 21,000 × g). Insoluble material of the supernatant was subsequently removed by ultracentrifugation (30 min, 120,000 × g). The cleared protein extract was then loaded onto a 10-ml Strep-Tactin column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) equilibrated with buffer W (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After washing with 5 bed volumes of buffer W, the bound proteins were eluted from the affinity resin with buffer E (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm desthiobiotin). Then both the partially unprocessed OmpA signal sequence and/or the Strep-Tag affinity sequence were cleaved with the protease factor Xa (1 μg of factor Xa per 200 μg of ProX protein) for 16 h at room temperature in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2. To remove factor Xa and other minor contaminating E. coli proteins from the A. fulgidus ProX protein solution, the solution was diluted 1:2 with deionized water and loaded onto a UnoQ6 column (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The column was washed with 20 ml of buffer A and the proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. ProX eluted at a NaCl concentration of 250 mm from the UnoQ6 column. The protein was stored until further use at 4 °C. In general, 2 mg of pure ProX protein were obtained per 1-liter culture. The ProX protein from A. fulgidus contains five methionines. For the labeling of the ProX protein with l-selenomethionine, the method of metabolic inhibition was employed (48Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 49van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). A 100-ml preculture of strain BL21 (Codon Plus RIL) (pGH26) was grown for 20 h in LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotics at 37 °C. Cells from 16 ml of this culture were recovered by centrifugation (5 min, 3,000 × g) and resuspended in the same volume of M9 minimal medium (45Miller J.H. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). This entire cell suspension was then used to inoculate 4 liters of M9 medium in a 10-liter flask. Cells were grown to an A578 of 0.3, and 100 mg liter-1l-lysine, 100 mg liter-1l-phenylalanine, 100 mg liter-1 threonine, 50 mg liter-1 isoleucine, 50 mg liter-1 leucine, 50 mg liter-1 valine, and 50 mg liter-1l-selenomethionine were added as solid powder to the cell culture. Fifteen minutes after addition of the amino acids, the expression of the A. fulgidus proX gene was induced by adding anhydrotetracycline (0.2 μg ml-1) to the culture. After 6 h of further growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 × g). The protein was then purified from these cells as described above for the unmodified ProX; the l-selenomethionine-labeled ProX showed the same behavior in each purification step as the unlabeled protein. The incorporation of l-selenomethionine into the purified ProX protein was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a sample of the unlabeled ProX protein as a reference. Crystallization—Crystals were grown using the vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. The protein solution containing 10 mg/ml protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl was mixed with equal amounts of the reservoir solutions described below. Liganded ProX crystallized in hanging drops using a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m ZnAc2, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0–6.5, 10–12% (w/v) PEG 4000. The crystals reached a final size of 250 × 200 × 150 μm3 after 3 days. They belong to the space group P21 (crystal form I). In a different setup, liganded ProX crystallized in sitting drops equilibrated against a reservoir containing 30% (w/v) PEG1500. The crystals grew to a maximum size of 50 × 50 × 50 μm3 within 2 months and belong to the space group P43212 (crystal form II). Unliganded ProX crystallized in hanging drops against a reservoir solution containing 0.3 m MgCl2, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.0–9.0, 35% (w/v) PEG4000. The first crystals appeared after 2–3 months, reached a final size of 300 × 300 × 150 μm3 and belong to space group C2 (crystal form III). Again u"
https://openalex.org/W2029812675,"Salvage pathways play an important role in providing nucleobases to cells, which are unable to synthesize sufficient amounts for their needs. Cellular uptake systems for pyrimidines have been described, but in higher eukaryotes, transporters for thymine and uracil have not been identified. Two plant transporters, AtUPS1 and PvUPS1, were recently identified as transporters for allantoin in Arabidopsis and French bean, respectively. However, Arabidopsis, in contrast to tropical legumes, uses mainly amino acids for long distance transport. Allantoin transport has not been described in the Brassicaceae. Thus, the physiological substrates of ureide permease (UPS) transporters in Arabidopsis may be compounds structurally related to allantoin. A detailed analysis of the substrate specificities of two members of the AtUPS family shows that AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 mediate high affinity uracil and 5-fluorouracil (a toxic uracil analogue) transport when expressed in yeast and Xenopus oocytes. Consistent with a function during germination and early seedling development, AtUPS1 expression is transiently induced during the early stages of seedling development followed by up-regulation of AtUPS2 expression. Arabidopsis ups2 insertion mutants and ups1 lines, in which transcript levels were reduced by post-transcriptional gene silencing, are more tolerant to 5-fluorouracil as compared with wild type plants. The results suggest that in Arabidopsis UPS transporters are the main transporters for uracil and potentially other nucleobases, whereas during evolution legumes may have taken advantage of the low selectivity of UPS proteins for long distance transport of allantoin.

Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are building blocks for DNA and RNA synthesis and essential precursors for enzyme cofactors (NAD, FAD, 5-adenosylmethionin, thiamin), signal molecules (e.g. cyclic nucleotides or the phytohormone cytokinins), and plant secondary metabolites (e.g. caffeine). They can be synthesized de novo or obtained by recycling of nucleosides and nucleobases (salvage pathways) (1Moffatt B.A. Ashihara H. Somerville C.R. Meyerowitz E.M. The Arabidopsis Book. American Society of Plant Biologists, Rockville, MD2002: 1-20Google Scholar, 2van der Graaff E. Hooykaas P. Lein W. Lerchl J. Kunze R. Sonnewald U. Boldt R. Front Biosci. 2004; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in salvage pathways frequently act with cellular import systems for their substrates in a concerted manner. Thus, most unicellular organisms including prokaryotes, fungi, and cellular parasites possess specialized transporters for the capture of nucleosides and nucleobases from their environment, which are used for nucleotide synthesis with lower net energy cost compared with de novo synthesis. In some extreme cases obligate parasites have lost the capacity to produce nucleotides via de novo synthesis, and import of nucleobases or nucleosides represents the only route to nucleotide formation. Uptake systems for nucleosides and nucleobases are also present in multicellular organisms. Moreover, the expression of uptake and release systems in distinct animal cell types seems to play a crucial role in the recovery and the distribution of nucleobases and nucleosides passing tissue barriers, e.g. in the kidney, intestine, and placenta (3de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Memb. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar). These transport systems, therefore, play not only an important role in organism physiology but also in the pharmaco-dynamics of anti-tumor compounds, such as 5-FU 1The abbreviations used are: 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil; UPS, ureide permease; PUP, purine permease; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; PRT, purine-related transporter; NAT, nucleobase-ascorbate transporter; PTGS, post transcriptional gene silencing; Ura, uracil; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; GUS, β-glucuronidase.

In plant cells adenylates comprise the largest nucleotide pool followed in size by uridylates. UDP-sugars serve as activated intermediates in the synthesis of sucrose and cell wall polymers (5Wagner K.G. Backer A.I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 1-84Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of the free pyrimidine bases, plants apparently can only salvage uracil, whereas they are unable to salvage cytosine due to the lack of cytosine deaminase (5Wagner K.G. Backer A.I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 134: 1-84Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells often rely on salvage pathways when the activities of enzymes for de novo synthesis are low or absent (e.g. during early stages of seed germination) or when demand for nucleobases is high (e.g. when cells divide rapidly). Although salvaging of nucleobases and nucleosides predominates at the inception of germination, its importance declines when germination proceeds and de novo synthesis takes over (6Stasolla C. Katahira R. Thorpe T.A. Ashihara H. J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 160: 1-25Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Salvaging is often accompanied by transport of nucleobases and nucleosides from storage tissues, as was demonstrated for germinating castor bean (7Kombrink E. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A high affinity transporter system for uracil with a Km of ∼40 μm was described (7Kombrink E. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1983; 73: 370-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the apparent physiological importance of high affinity transport of free pyrimidines, in particular of uracil, no transporters for these substrates have been identified in plants or other higher eukaryotes until now. A number of membrane protein families mediating transport of nucleobases or nucleosides into the cell have been described to date; they comprise (i) the nucleobase ascorbate transporters (NAT; Archaea, eubacteria, fungi, plants, and animals) (8Tsukaguchi H.

Only two of these families include members with demonstrated capacity to transport uracil and other free pyrimidines; NAT, e.g. UraA in Escherichia coli (18Andersen P.S. Frees D. Fast R. Mygind B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2008-2013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PRT, e.g. FUR4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (19Jund R. Weber E. Chevallier M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the investigated NAT homologues in animals mediate Na+-coupled ascorbate transport, and maize Lpe1 (leaf permease), the only NAT protein characterized so far in plants, transports xanthine and uric acid (9Argyrou E. Sophianopoulou V. Schultes V. Diallinas G. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PRT homologues are not present in higher eukaryotes with the exception of an expressed Arabidopsis protein with unknown function (At5g03555). Recently, members of the UPS family mediating allantoin transport were identified in Arabidopsis and French bean (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Pélissier H.C. Frerich A. Desimone M. Schumacher K. Tegeder M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 664-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Allantoin is an important transport form of organic nitrogen in legumes, whereas Arabidopsis is considered to preferentially transport amino acids. Therefore, the substrate specificities of AtUPS1 and AtUPS2, related members of the UPS family from Arabidopsis, were analyzed in detail. Using heterologous expression in yeast and in Xenopus oocytes, it was demonstrated that pyrimidines are excellent substrates for both AtUPS1 and AtUPS2. The affinity for uracil was several-fold higher than for allantoin. In plants, expression of AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 was high during periods of increased demand of nucleotides, i.e. early seedling development, indicating a function in salvage pathways, e.g. by the utilization of pyrimidines from seed storage tissue. In planta, AtUPS function as major transporters for uracil analogs and potentially uracil itself, as demonstrated by the increased tolerance to 5-FU of plants in which AtUPS1 was inhibited by PTGS or in plants that carry T-DNA insertions in AtUPS2. UPS1 and UPS2 Expression Constructs—AtUPS2 was amplified by PCR from a cDNA library from 5-day-old seedlings from Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) with the primers 5′-ATAGGATCCATCCATTTAGAGCCCGAGAAT-3′ and 5′-ATATCTAGATTACTTTCTATGTCCAGAAGA-3′ and cloned into pCR4TopoBlunt (Invitrogen). Sequencing revealed mutations of A to T (at position 276 of the open reading frame) and A678 to G not resulting in an altered protein sequence. In addition, T308 was mutated to C, causing a valine to alanine exchange. This mutation was reverted by site-directed mutagenesis. The AtUPS1-coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pFL61UPS1 (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cloned into pCR4TopoBlunt. The AtUPS1-coding sequences were BamHI/XbaI excised from pCR4TopoBluntUPS1 and cloned into the oocyte expression vector pOO2 (20Ludewig U. von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13548-13555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) cut by BamHI/XbaI. The UPS1 oocyte expression construct was described previously (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The UPS2 coding sequence was BamHI/XhoI-excised from pOO2UPS2 and subcloned into the yeast expression vector pDR199. pDR199UPS1 was derived by amplifying UPS1 from the cDNA library with primers 5′-CCCAGCCTTGAAAATAATTAAAATTTATAATTTTAAAAGATAAAAGAGAGATAGAAAGAT-G-3′ and 5′-AAGCTGGATCGCTCGAGTCGACTGCAGGCCGCCCGGGCCGTCATTTTCTATGTCCCGAGGAAG-3′. The PCR product together with the EcoRI/BamHI-linearized vector pDR199 was introduced into a yeast dal4 dal5 knock out strain (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) by in vivo cloning (21Dohmen R.S. Strasser A.W. Honer C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). After selection on uracil-free medium, plasmids were isolated, and the cDNA insertion was verified by sequencing. Two T to C mutations (positions 997 and 1152 of the open reading frame), which do not alter the protein sequence, were found in the coding sequence. pMD200 was derived from pDR195 (22Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmelzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) by disruption of the URA3 gene by ApaI/NcoI digestion and introduction of the LEU2 gene. LEU2 was PCR-amplified with primers 5′-ATAGGGCCCGTGGGAATACTCAGGTATCG-3′ and 5′-ATACCATGGCTGGACGTAAACTCCTCTTC-3′ from pACT2 (BD Biosciences). The UPS1 (UPS2)-coding sequences were excised from pCR4TopoBluntUPS1 (pCR4TopoBluntUPS2) and cloned into pMD200; UPS1 was excised EcoRI, blunted, and introduced into the blunted NotI site of pMD200; UPS2 was excised by XbaI/NotI, XbaI was blunted, and the construct was introduced into pMD200 (BamHI-blunted/NotI). Expression in Yeast—The yeast dal4 dal5 mutant strain was transformed with pDR199 or pDR199UPS1 (pDR199UPS2) (23Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 255-269Google Scholar). Growth tests were performed on medium (synthetic defined medium without ammonium sulfate) with 5 mm allantoin. The yeast strain CEN.PK 2-1C (Euroscarf) was used to generate a fur4 knockout mutant strain by using a loxP-KanMX-loxP disruption cassette (24Güldner U. Heck S. Fiedler T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The fur4 mutant strain was selected on synthetic defined medium (with 38 mm ammonium sulfate, 200 mg/liter G418, 0.1 mm l-histidine, 0.1 mm l-tryptophan, 0.2 mm uridine), confirmed by PCR, and subsequently transformed with pMD200 or pMD200UPS1 (pMD200UPS2). Growth tests were performed on medium with 0.2 mm uracil instead of uridine. Transport measurements with 14C-labeled allantoin were performed as previously described (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Expression in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—Oocytes were surgically removed from female X. laevis frogs. Follicular cell layers and connective tissues were removed by digesting with 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche Applied Science) for 1.5–2 h at 22 °C in a Ca2+-free solution composed of 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Oocytes were subsequently washed 5–8 times with ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Healthy oocytes at developmental stages V-VI were selected and maintained at 16 °C in ND96 solution supplied with 50 mg/liter gentamycin and 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate (ND96-G). Capped cRNAs were transcribed in vitro using the mMessage mMachine mRNA SP6 kit (Ambion) from linearized plasmids pOO2UPS1 and pOO2UPS2. RNA yields were estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentrations were finally adjusted to ∼1 μg/μl with nuclease-free water. Oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of cRNA (20–50 ng/oocyte) and incubated at 16 °C in ND96-G solution to allow the expression of AtUPS genes. Electrophysiology—Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed starting 2 days after injection. The standard perfusion solution (wash solution) contained 100 mm choline chloride, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 in 5 mm Mes-Tris, pH 5.5. Substances were dissolved in this solution to final concentrations of 200 μm, and the pH values were adjusted to 5.5 with Mes or Tris. For voltage-current analysis, currents were recorded while clamping the oocytes at –100 mV or by applying an I/V protocol. The I/V protocol consisted of 200-ms pulses of voltages ranging from –140 to 0 mV in steps of 20 mV. Substrate evoked currents were constant during these short pulses. Net currents induced by substrates were obtained by subtracting the background currents (measured with “wash solution” alone) before and after the addition of substrates. To avoid endogenous currents, which were slowly activated at more negative voltages, currents elicited at more negative voltages than –120 mV were not analyzed (in some cases only voltages in the range of 0 to –100 mV were analyzed). No differences between non-injected and water-injected oocytes were observed; thus, in most cases non-injected oocytes were used as controls. T-DNA Insertion Lines—A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 was used throughout this study. Seeds of the T-DNA insertion lines Salk_ 143013 (designated ups2-1) and Salk_044551 (designated ups2-2) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, Ohio) (25Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. et al.Science. 2003; 301: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). Homozygous plants were isolated from T3 plants and confirmed in the T4 generation. Genomic DNA was prepared as described (www.dartmouth.edu/~tjack/TAILDNAprep.html). Homozygous lines were screened by two sets of PCR. The first PCR was performed using gene-specific primers 5′-GTAGATAAGTTTTCCGTGACG-3′ and 5′-GAACCTAGCAAAGGTAGTGTC-3′ (Salk_044551) or 5′-CATTGCAAACATAACAGACG-3′ and 5′-GTATCTTTACATTCTCTGG-AC-3′ (Salk_143013). The second PCR was carried out with the T-DNA left border primer 5′-CTTTGACGTTGGAGTCCAC-3′ and the primer 5′-GAACCTAGCAAAGGTAGTGTC-3′ (Salk_044551) or 5′-GTATCTTTACATTCTCTGGAC-3′ (Salk_143013). Plants were considered homozygous if no PCR product was obtained by the first PCR reaction, and fragments of expected size confirming the T-DNA insertion were amplified by the second PCR reaction. Localization of T-DNA insertions was analyzed by sequencing. Homozygous lines were subsequently taken for further investigations. PTGS Construct—A 521-bp AtUPS1 fragment (sense) was amplified by PCR from pFL61UPS1 using primers 5′-ACTAGTTAAAAGAGAGATAGAAAGATG-3′ and 5′-AAGCTTCTTTTGAAATTTTGGAGTTTG-3′, and a similar 521-bp fragment (antisense) was amplified using primers 5′-CTCGAGCTTTTGAAATTTTGGAGTTTG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGATAAAAGAGAGATAGAAAGATG-3′. An 882-bp fragment of the second intron of AtAAP6 (At5g49630) was amplified from BAC K6M13 using primers 5′-ATAAAGCTTATCCTATCTAGGTCAGATTCG-3′ and 5′-TCTAGAATACTCGAGACTTTTCTTCCTCCTGTTTAT-3′. All fragments were cloned into pCR4TopoBlunt and sequenced. The UPS1 antisense fragment was excised with XbaI/XhoI and ligated into the pCR4TopoBluntAAP6intron construct. The resulting construct was subsequently cleaved with HindIII/SpeI and the UPS1 sense fragment, excised by HindIII/SpeI, was introduced. The complete UPS1 sense-AAP6-intron-UPS1-antisense construct was subcloned into pCB302.3 (27Xiang C. Han P. Lutziger I. Wang K. Oliver D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) using SpeI/XbaI. Promoter-GUS Constructs—The AtUPS1 (AtUPS2) promoter region comprising the 647-bp (721 bp) genomic DNA extending from the 3′-untranslated region of the preceding gene to ATG was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA (BAC T4M8) using primers 5′-ATAACTAGTCTTACAAGAACAGCAAGCTTT-3′ and 5′-ATAGGATCCCTTTCTATCTCTCTTTTATAT-3′ (5′-ATATCTAGAATGATCTTATCATAGTTGTAT-3′ and 5′-ATAGGATCCACAAGCTATGGCACCTCCTTT-3′), cloned into pCR4TopoBlunt, and sequenced. The AtUPS1 (AtUPS2) promoter was excised by SpeI/BamHI (XbaI/BamHI) and introduced into pCB308 (27Xiang C. Han P. Lutziger I. Wang K. Oliver D.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Plant Transformation—pCB302.3 and pCB308 constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 for plant transformation. Arabidopsis plants grown in the greenhouse were transformed with Agrobacterium using the floral dip method (28Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transgenic plants (T1 to T3 generation) were recovered by BASTA™ (phosphinothricin). For analysis of GUS activity three lines (T3) of the translational fusions of AtUPS1 or AtUPS2 promoter regions with the uidA gene were used for further investigation. Five randomly chosen T3 or T4 lines containing the UPS1-PTGS construct, three of which were homozygous and two heterozygous (based on BASTA resistance segregation), were analyzed for mRNA levels and phenotypic alterations. Plant Growth—Seeds were vernalized at 4 °C for 2 days before imbibition. Plants were grown in a Percival Scientific growth chamber under a 16 h of light/8 h of dark photoperiod at 22 °C and a light intensity of 100–150 microeinsteins m-2 s-1. Plates with MS medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.7% (w/v) phytagar (Invitrogen) were used for all experiments except for studies with N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (1 mm) and exogenous pyrimidines (1 mm). In the latter studies seedlings were grown in liquid MS medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm. For growth assays on 5-FU, the medium was supplemented with 200 μm quantities of this compound. Promoter GUS assays—Plants were harvested from days 1 to 11 after imbibition and analyzed for β-glucuronidase activity (29Martin T. Wöhner R.V. Hummel S. Willmitzer L. Frommer W.B. Gallagher S.R. GUS Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1992: 23-43Crossref Google Scholar). Staining was performed for 15 h at 37 °C. For root sections, 6-day-old plants were prefixed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1.4% formaldehyde. Plants were washed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, followed by GUS staining for 8 h at 37 °C and subsequent fixation in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde. Dehydration was performed in an ethanol series followed by embedding in hydroxyethyl methacrylate (Technovit 7100, Heraeus Kulzer). 6-μm-thick sections were prepared with a LKB Ultratome and counterstained in purple by periodic acid-Schiff staining. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from agar-grown seedlings of Arabidopsis was extracted (30Chang S. Puryear J. Cairney J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 11: 113-116Crossref Scopus (2977) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesized with RevertAid™ H minus M murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI) was used as template for PCR reactions. As an internal control a 641-bp fragment of the AtACT2 gene was amplified by PCR (26 cycles) using primers 5′-CGTACAACCGGTATTGTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGACCTGCCTCATCATACTCG-3′. For AtUPS1 (AtUPS2) primers 5′-CAATTTCTGCAAGCAACGGGTTAAC-3′ and 5′-ACAAGTGGAAGTGCCTGAACAGCG-3′ (5′-CATCAAAAGACCTGGAGACTAATG-3′ and 5′-CTCACAAGTGGAAGAGCCTGAACG-3′) were used to amplify a 481-bp (484 bp) fragment by PCR in 30 or 32 cycles. Total RNA was isolated from 9-day-old seedlings grown in liquid cultures using RNeasy (Qiagen), treated with DNase I, and reverse-transcribed. PCR (29 cycles each) of AtUPS1 (AtUPS2) templates with primers 5′-GCACAATAATCGGATTGGTG-3′ and 5′-ATGTTAAGTATCAGAGCAACTACAAATGC-3′ (5′-GTATCGTGCTTAGCCTCG-3′ and 5′-TGTTCCTATTTCGGTAGATGGACC-3′) produced a 187-bp (299 bp) fragment. For AtACT2 a 192-bp fragment was amplified by PCR (26 cycles) using primers 5′-TCCTCACTTTCATCAGCCG-3′ and 5′-ATTGGTTGAATATCATCAGCC-3′. AtUPS1 and –2 Mediate Allantoin Uptake—Out of the five members of the UPS family in Arabidopsis, AtUPS1 and AtUPS3 seem to have arisen from a recent gene duplication as well as AtUPS 2 and AtUPS4. To be able to compare the properties of these two groups, the AtUPS2 cDNA (At2g03530) was isolated from a seedling cDNA library. AtUPS2 showed 74% sequence identity to AtUPS1 on the amino acid level. The yeast mutant dal4 dal5, deficient in the uptake of allantoin and allantoic acid, previously used to isolate AtUPS1 (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), was used to demonstrate that AtUPS2 was able to suppress the mutant phenotype in a growth assay using 5 mm allantoin as the sole source of nitrogen (Fig. 1A). Colonies of cells expressing AtUPS2 or AtUPS1 were several times bigger as those formed by control cells transformed with the empty vector. AtUPS1 colonies grew slightly faster than AtUPS2 colonies. In addition, uptake of [14C]allantoin, due to AtUPS2 expression, was directly shown. The uptake rate was ∼75% of the rate observed for AtUPS1-expressing yeast, whereas the uptake rates of dal4 dal5 yeast mutant cells transformed with the empty vector was ∼3% of the rate observed upon AtUPS1 or AtUPS2 expression (Supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, both proteins mediate allantoin transport. AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 Also Transport Uracil—Because there is no evidence that Arabidopsis uses allantoin as a long distance transport form of nitrogen, it was conceivable that in Arabidopsis UPS has a different physiological substrate. Previous studies had shown that AtUPS1 recognizes oxo derivatives of N-heterocycles (13Desimone M. Catoni E. Ludewig U. Hilpert M. Schneider A. Kunze R. Tegeder M. Frommer W.B. Schumacher K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because the structure of uracil fits the criteria established previously, and since uracil transport in plants has been described but transporters have not been identified, we tested whether AtUPS1 or AtUPS2 would be able to mediate uracil uptake. The yeast mutant fur4, deficient in uracil uptake, grew on 0.2 mm uracil as the sole source of pyrimidines when expressing AtUPS1 or AtUPS2, demonstrating that both transporters mediate uracil uptake (Fig. 1B). Functional Expression of AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 in Xenopus Oocytes—To test the substrate specificities of AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 more directly, both transporters were functionally expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Expression of AtUPS1 induced inward currents in oocytes bathed in buffer with allantoin in a flow system. When clamped at –100 mV, significant inward currents were also recorded from AtUPS2-expressing oocytes upon the addition of allantoin (Fig. 2A), whereas no significant currents were detected in non-injected control oocytes (Fig. 2, B and C). To define the substrate specificity in detail, a large number of compounds were tested. Criteria for the selection of potential substrates were (i) molecules belonging to the group of nucleobases and derivatives, (ii) compounds transported by other nucleobase transporters, and (iii) compounds with similar structural features. Currents were induced by cyclic purine degradation products and pyrimidines. In case of allantoin, hydantoin-, cytosine-, thymine- or uracil-induced currents remained stable or slowly decreased until washout of the substrates. However, when flushed with xanthine, the evoked current decreased within 10 s to a lower steady state level (Fig. 2A). A similar effect was found for uric acid (not shown). Despite lower current levels, AtUPS1 behaved in a manner similar to AtUPS2. Clamping oocytes to –100 mV for longer periods resulted in small shifts of the base line (Fig. 2A). To minimize errors conferred by this process, further investigations were done using brief substrate flushing periods and the I/V protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” The allantoin-induced currents recorded from AtUPS1- or AtUPS2-expressing oocytes increased in response to further hyperpolarization of the membrane potential (Fig. 2C) and displayed clear voltage dependence. Steady state currents induced by different substances were plotted as a percentage of those caused by allantoin set to 100% (Fig. 3, A and B). The cyclic purine degradation products uric acid and xanthine induced currents in AtUPS1- and AtUPS2-expressing oocytes (∼60 and 50% for AtUPS1, 75 and 40% for AtUPS2, respectively). All pyrimidines and their tested derivatives (cytosine, uracil, thymine, dihydrouracil, and 5-FU) induced currents of different magnitude (Fig. 3A). Slight differences were found between AtUPS1 and AtUPS2 in response to thymine and cytosine (∼92 and 105% for thy"

Mutations of p53 occur in over 50% of all cancers and are indicative of highly aggressive cancers that are hard to treat. Recently, there has been a high degree of interest in therapeutic approaches to restore growth suppression functions to mutant p53. Several compounds have been reported to restore wild type function to mutant p53. One such compound, CP-31398, has been shown effective in vivo, but questions have arisen to whether it actually affects p53. Here we show that mutant p53, isolated from cells treated with CP-31398, is capable of binding to p53 response elements in vitro. We also show the compound restores DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in cells as determined by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain from two different hotspot mutants (R273H and R249S), we show that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity in a dose-dependent manner. Using a quantitative DNA binding assay, we also show that CP-31398 increases significantly the amount of mutant p53 that binds to cognate DNA (Bmax) and its affinity (Kd) for DNA. The compound, however, does not affect the affinity (Kd value) of wild type p53 for DNA and only increases Bmax slightly. In a similar assay PRIMA1 does not have any effect on p53 core DNA-binding activity. We also show that CP-31398 had no effect on the DNA-binding activity of p53 homologs p63 and p73.

The p53 tumor suppressor protein belongs to a superfamily of transcription factors that includes its homologs p63 and p73. p53 is involved in a wide range of cellular activities that help ensure the stability of the genome, whereas p63 and p73 are involved in ectodermal morphogenesis, limb morphogenesis, neurogenesis, and homeostatic control and are not considered tumor suppressor genes (1Bernard J.

These mutations can be divided into two main classes, DNA contact mutants, like R273H, where the mutation alters a residue involved in contact with DNA, and structural mutants, like R249S, which result in structural changes in the p53 core domain (6Wong K.-B.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These mutations affect the function of p53 by distorting the structure and reducing the thermal stability of the protein (6Wong K.-B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.V. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This can alter the ability of p53 to bind to various p53 response elements in a variety of genes, hampering its transcriptional regulation (9Nicholls C.D. McLure K.G. Shields M.A. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12937-12945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, these mutations may alter p53 structure, so that p53 can no longer induce apoptosis by binding to BclXL, thereby inhibiting its anti-apoptotic function (10Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). One potential therapeutic approach to cancer would be restoration of growth suppression activity to mutant p53. Several approaches have been tried, ranging from micro-injection of monoclonal antibody 421, C-terminal peptide of p53 and small molecules (11Abarzua P. LoSardo J.E. Gubler M.L. Spathis R. Lu Y.-A.

Recently, small molecules and peptides, such as CP-31398, PRIMA1, and CDB3 peptide, have been shown to be effective in restoring p53 function (17Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F.

Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 22Luu Y. Bush J. Cheung Jr., K.-J. Li G. Exp.

Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both CP-31398 and PRIMA1 have been shown to reduce tumor size in animal models (17Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 18Bykov V.J.N. Issaeva N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Pugacheva E. Chumakov P. Bergman J. Wiman K.G. Selinova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). It is postulated that the two molecules perform similar tasks, but by different mechanisms. PRIMA1 has been suggested to work more broadly to restore p53 DNA-binding activity, but the specific mechanism is not known (18Bykov V.J.N. Issaeva N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Pugacheva E. Chumakov P. Bergman J. Wiman K.G. Selinova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). CP-31398, on the other hand, has been suggested to stabilize p53 as a protectant against thermal denaturation and maintain monoclonal antibody 1620 epitope conformation in newly synthesized p53 (17Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Recently, CP-31398 has also been shown to stabilize wild type p53 in cells by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation (23Wang W. Takimoto R. Ratinejad F. El-Diery W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Reports from other studies suggest that CP-31398 interacts with DNA and not with p53 in vitro, and it is proposed to act as a DNA-damaging agent (26Rippin T.M. Bykov V.J.N. Freund S.M.V. Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2119-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that the effects of CP-31398 on p53 do not depend on the DNA damage pathway (23Wang W. Takimoto R. Ratinejad F. El-Diery W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), its p53-independent cellular growth suppression effects at higher concentrations and lack of demonstrated binding to p53 protein raise confusion about its mechanism of action (24Wischhusen J. Naumann U. Ohgaki H. Rastinejad F. Weller M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8233-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Takimoto R. Wang W. Dicker D.T. Rastinejad F. Lyssikatos J. El-Diery W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Rippin T.M. Bykov V.J.N. Freund S.M.V. Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2119-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that CP-31398 can promote mutant p53 to bind to p53 response elements in vivo using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, using purified p53 core domain, we clearly demonstrate that CP-31398 can restore DNA-binding activity to mutant p53 in vitro. We also show that CP-31398 does not have any effects on the DNA-binding activity of the p53 homologs, p63 and p73. In contrast, PRIMA1 was ineffective in restoring DNA-binding activity to isolated mutant p53 DNA binding domain. Cell Culture—WiDr cells, which contain an R273H hotspot mutation, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin. H1299 cells were grown in RPMI medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin and streptomycin. SkBr3 (mt.p53) cells were grown in McCoy's medium from Invitrogen, supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Cell Transfection—WiDr cells were transfected with either pSuper or pSuper-p53 (gift of Dr. J. Wischhusen) (24Wischhusen J. Naumann U. Ohgaki H. Rastinejad F. Weller M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8233-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad GenePulser. Flow Cytometry Analysis—H1299 (p53-null) and SkBr3 cells were treated for 24 h with either 0 or 2.5 μg/ml CP-31398. After 24 h, the cells were trypsinized, fixed in 70% methanol, and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The fixed cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage instrument. Cell Lysis and Western Blotting—Cell lysis of WiDr cells was carried out using the method of Foster et al. (17Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). 40 mg of cell lysate was run either on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (for p53 and actin) or a 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (p21 and bax). The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and probed with antibodies to p53 (DO1), actin (Sigma), Bax (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or p21 (Calbiochem). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—WiDr cells were plated at 107 cells/ml and treated for 24 h with either 1% Me2SO (untreated) or 10 μg/ml CP-31398 in 1% Me2SO final. The ChIP assay was performed as described by Frank et al. (27Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed in the presence or absence of p53 antibody DO1 (Calbiochem). PCR was performed with 10 μl of DNA, 800 nm primers, and fluorescent probe (28Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1489Crossref Scopus (9153) Google Scholar) diluted in a final volume of 30 μl. The accumulations of fluorescence products were monitored on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. The primer/probe pairs used were as follows. Bax: forward, 5′-TCCCCCCGAGAGGTCTTTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGCCCCAGTTGAAGTTG-3′; probe (6FAM): 5′-TCAGAAAACATGTCAGCTGCCACTCGG-3′; p21: forward, 5′-TGGAGACTCTCAGGGTCGAAA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCGTTTGGAGTGGTAGAAATC-3′; probe (6FAM): 5′-CGGCGGCAGACCAGCATGAC-3′; S9: forward, 5′-GGCTCCGGAACAAACGTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCGGCCTTGCGGATCT-3′; and probe (6FAM) 5′-TCTGGAGGGTCAAATTTACCCTGGCC-3′. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The DNA binding domain of p53 (aa92–312) was generated via PCR from plasmid pCTK53 (Isabella Atencio, Canji Inc.) using gene-specific primers 5′-ATGGATCCATGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCC-3′ and 5′-TAAAGCTTTCAGGTGTTGTTGGGCAGTGC-3′. The resulting product was cloned into the BamHI/HindIII site of plasmid pET42a (Novagen), to generate a recombinant GST-5X His fusion protein (GST-His p53DBD wt). A mutant p53R249S was generated by the same method from pCTMR249S and called pGST-His p53DBDR249S. The p53 mutant, R273H was generated by mutagenesis of pCTK53 by polymerase chain reaction. The subsequent mutant was then used to generate the mutated DNA binding domain by the same procedure as for the wild type DNA binding domain. The resulting PCR product was also cloned into BamHI/HindIII site in pET42a to generate the recombinant GST-5X His fusion protein (GST-His p53DBDR273H). The DNA binding domains of p63 and p73 were generated by polymerase chain reaction from plasmids pCUB 412 (p63) and pCUB370 (p73) (gifts of Dr. Charles DiComo) using gene-specific primers 5′-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGATGCTCTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTCATGTCATCTGGATACCATGTC-3′ for p63 and 5′-CATGCCATGGCAAGCTCCACCTTCGACACCATGTC-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTACTCTTCTTCACACCGGCACC-3′ for p73. The resulting PCR products were cloned similarly into pET42a and expressed as a GST-5X His fusion protein, GST-His p63DBD, and GST-His p73DBD. The various plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) bacteria for expression. p53 containing plasmid-transformed bacteria were initially grown at 30 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.8–1.2 and then were cooled to 18 °C. After 1 h at low temperature, they were induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and grown overnight at 18 °C. p63 and p73, containing plasmid-transformed bacteria, were initially grown at 37 °C, and then shifted to 28 °C and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cultures were grown overnight at 28 °C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science). After resuspension, Triton X-100 (Sigma) was added to 1% in volume, and the bacterial paste was lysed by sonication (Kontes). The lysate was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The lysate was filtered with a Whatman Puradisc filter and applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (AP Biotech) column, equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The flow-through and the first column wash were collected and applied to an HR16/10 glutathione-Sepharose column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in the above buffer. The protein was eluted with a single step of 40 mm glutathione in 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.3, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The eluted peak was then applied to a Mono S HR5/5 column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted with a salt gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. The material was then pooled and frozen at –80 °C for later use in assays. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts of WiDr cells were prepared according to a published method (28Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1474-1489Crossref Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence on 100-cm2 plates and treated with either 10 mg/ml CP-31398, in a final concentration of 1% Me2SO, or 1% Me2SO for 24 h. The cells were then washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped off the plate in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The volume of the packed pellet was estimated and was added to four volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, with protease inhibitor tablet) while the pellet was being vortexed. The resuspended pellet was left on ice for 5 min, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in four volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and re-centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded, and the packed nuclei volume was estimated. Three volumes of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor) were added while vortexing. The extract was left at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 25, 000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The EMSA (gel shift) assay was done with both nuclear extracts and recombinant proteins. The protein was added to a mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 ng of deoxyinosine/deoxycytodine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm spermidine in the presence or absence of CP-31398 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. A 25-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the p53 consensus DNA binding sequence (5′-AGCTGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′) and end labeled with either 32P or 33P was added into the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min. The mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (1× TBE is 100 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4) and run at 150 V in 0.5× TBE (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and exposed on a Fuji Fluorescent Image Analyzer with the image being quantitated with the phosphorimaging software. DNA Binding Assay—To quantitate binding of p53 to either p53 consensus sequence or bax promoter sequence (5′-AGCACAAGCCTGGGCGTGGGC-3′), biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized (Research Genetics and IDT, respectively). First, protein and compound mixtures were incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 ng of deoxyinosine/deoxycytodine, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 10 min at room temperature in a volume of 45 μl. Then, 5 μl of DNA was added to the mixture for a final volume of 50 μl, and the mixture incubated for an additional 10 min. Then 167 fmol of primary antibody (Anti-Penta His monoclonal antibody, Qiagen) and 12.5 μg of streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal) in antibody buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) were added, and the mixture was shaken for 1 h at room temperature. At 1 h, 333 fmol of secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories) labeled with Ruthenium oxide (IGEN) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the mixture was incubated with shaking for an additional hour. At the end of the incubation, 75 μl of antibody buffer was added to bring the final volume to 200 μl. The reaction mixture was then assayed on either an M8 analyzer or M384 analyzer workstation (IGEN) using IGEN read and stop buffer. Data were analyzed using Prism 3.0 software from Graph-Pad Software. CP-31398 Restores p53 Activity to Mutant p53 in Vivo—To evaluate the effects of CP-31398 in restoring wild type p53 function to mutant p53, we tested to see if the compound could restore p53-mediated apoptosis to cells harboring mutant p53. We treated both H1299 cells, which are p53-null cells, and SkBr3 tumor cells, which have the p53 mutation R175H, with or without 2.5 μg/ml CP-31398 and assayed for apoptosis via fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig. 1A). Apoptosis is only seen in the SkBr3 cells that are treated with 2.5 μg/ml CP-31398. The H1299 cells show no apoptosis effect when treated with CP-31398 and are similar to the untreated H1299 cells. Previous reports (22Luu Y. Bush J. Cheung Jr., K.-J. Li G. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 276: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 23Wang W. Takimoto R. Ratinejad F. El-Diery W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Wischhusen J. Naumann U. Ohgaki H. Rastinejad F. Weller M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8233-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Takimoto R. Wang W. Dicker D.T. Rastinejad F. Lyssikatos J. El-Diery W.S. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2002; 1: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have shown that CP-31398 can induce p53-mediated apoptosis in mutant p53 tumor cells and that it has maximal effectiveness at 10 μg/ml, which is the concentration that we used in subsequent experiments. Because the effect of CP-31398 seems to be dependent upon the presence of p53, we treated WiDr cells, a colon tumor cell line that harbors an R273H hotspot mutation, with either 0 or 10 μg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, and then made a nuclear extract, which we then used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a consensus p53 DNA binding site (Fig. 1B) to see if CP-31398 could restore sequence-specific binding to mutant p53. Treatment with CP-31398 causes a shift of labeled probe that can be competed away with unlabeled p53 consensus oligonucleotide, in the CP-31398-treated nuclear extract, whereas no such band occurs in the untreated extract, indicating that the compound was capable of inducing mutant p53 to bind p53-specific DNA. To further demonstrate that the effect of CP-31398 was specific for p53-responsive genes, we treated WiDr cells with 0 or 10 μg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, then made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, bax, p21, and actin. Treatment with CP-31398 did not alter the level of either p53 or actin, but it significantly increased the level of both p21 and bax (Fig. 1C). In addition, we transiently transfected WiDr cells either with pSuper-p53, which encodes p53 SiRNA, or with the control empty vector, pSuper, then treated transfected cells with either 0 or 10 μg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h, made a cell lysate, and Western blotted for p53, actin, p21, and bax. The cells transfected with pSuper behaved similarly to the untransfected WiDr cells (Fig. 1C). The level of p53 and actin were unaltered, but there was a significant increase in the levels of both p21 and bax in the presence of CP-31398. With the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, actin levels were unaffected, but p53 levels were significantly decreased with or without CP-31398 (Fig. 1C). In addition, there was no induction of p21 or bax in the pSuper-p53-transfected cells, indicating that the effects of CP-31398 were dependent on the presence of p53. To prove that the induction of bax and p21 was due to promoter binding of mutant p53 reactivated by CP-31398 in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay in WiDr cells treated with either 0 or 10 μg/ml CP-31398 for 24 h (Fig. 1D). Treatment with CP-31398 specifically increased the amount of both p21 and bax promoter DNA that was immunoprecipitated with p53-specific antibody DO1, whereas there was no increase in the amount of ribosomal protein S9 promoter DNA, whose promoter does not have a p53 response element. This indicates that the effect of CP-31398 is specific for p53 and promotes the reactivation of full-length mutant p53 into functional “wild type” p53, which is fully capable of binding DNA in vivo. Characterization of CP-31398 Effects on p53 in Vitro—Given that CP-31398 appears to be capable of restoring DNA-binding activity to full-length mutant p53 in vivo, we wanted to see if CP-31398 would be equally effective in a system using purified protein, free of any potential cellular contaminants. Previous reports (19Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M.V. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have indicated that CP-31398 protects the DNA binding domain of p53 from thermo-denaturation in vitro. We then cloned and expressed the DNA binding domain of wild type and mutant p53 as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). To see if the recombinant material was capable of binding to DNA, we performed an EMSA using wild type p53 DNA binding domain (GST-His p53DBD wt) (Fig. 2B). The wild type protein bound to a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a p53 consensus binding sequence. Binding could be competed away with excess unlabeled p53-specific oligonucleotide but not with excess unlabeled nonspecific oligonucleotide. With wild type protein, a doublet is normally seen. The slower migrating band corresponds to the GST dimer of the protein, which is also observed with the mutant protein. The faster migrating lower band is monomeric GSTp53. Similar effects with GST fusion proteins have been previously observed (29Klein C. Georges G. Kunkele K.-P. Huber R. Engh R.A. Hansen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37390-37401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To see the effect on mutant p53 protein, we tested the binding of mutant R273H GST-His p53 DNA binding domain protein to both a consensus p53 DNA binding site oligonucleotide and an altered p53 DNA binding site (Fig. 2C).

Early events in retroviral replication include entry of the viral capsid with the accompanying enzymes reverse transcriptase and integrase (IN) followed by synthesis of a DNA copy of the viral RNA genome to form a preintegration complex. This complex then enters the nucleus, and integration is first detected at approximately 3–4 h postinfection (13Vandegraaff N. Kumar R. Burrell C.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11253-11260Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Retroviral integration is catalyzed by integrase acting on specific sequences at the ends of the viral DNA and via a concerted cleavage-ligation reaction that is mechanistically similar to that catalyzed by RAG proteins during V(D)J recombination (14Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 15Craig N.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16van Gent D.C.

As a consequence of integrase-mediated joining, the host cell DNA suffers a DSB, but the ends are held together by single strand links to viral DNA (Fig. 1B). Postintegration repair of this intermediate (Fig. 1B) is essential for the maintenance of host DNA integrity as well as the stable association of retroviral DNA with host chromosomes.

In this study, we asked whether H2AX is phosphorylated at sites of retroviral DNA integration and whether this response is essential for repair of this complex lesion as determined by survival of stably transduced cells. Cells and Viruses—MO59K cells (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained as described previously (18Daniel R. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Hittle J.C. Yen T.J. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell.

Immunofluorescence and Quantification of Foci—Cells were plated and infected the following day at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) 10. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at the indicated times postinfection. After permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100, samples were blocked overnight with 3% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. The slides were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against γH2AX (Upstate) and then with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole prior to mounting the slides with SlowFade antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Processed cells were examined for γH2AX foci by monitoring fluorescence of the Alexa Fluor dye using an UltraView confocal imaging system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in which the confocal scanning head was mounted on a Nikon TE-200E microscope. Optical sections along the z axis of the nuclei were captured at 0.1-μm intervals, and the final images were obtained by projection of the individual sections. For each time point, images of at least 100 cells were captured and used for quantitative analysis of γH2AX foci. To prevent bias in the selection of cells that displayed foci, nuclei were randomly selected for 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and then monitored for focus formation. The γH2AX foci were counted in each cell using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). A setting that excluded relatively weak foci and background speckles was used as a standard for foci quantitation in all the cells selected for analysis. A simple stochastic model for viral integration and formation of γH2AX foci was designed to relate the number of foci counted in cells to the time of observation. Virus is modeled as being integrated at 4 h, on average, after the start of the experiment. The exact time of integration and start of H2AX phosphorylation are taken to be normally distributed, with a mean of 4 h and a standard deviation of 1.1 h. H2AX phosphorylation is modeled to continue for an exponentially distributed random time, with a mean of 2.6 h. The number of viruses integrating in a cell is taken to be Poisson distributed. The best fit to experimental data is achieved with a mean m.o.i. of 8.5 viruses/cell. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as described by Boyd and Farnham (21Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In our experiments, 106 HeLa cells were infected with amphotropic ASV vectors IN+ or IN– (17Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). At defined times after infection, formaldehyde (1% final) was added, and the cultures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min to cross-link viral DNA and interacting proteins. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with glycine (0.125 m final concentration). Plates were washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and then cells were scraped into 1× phosphate-buffered saline that contained protease inhibitors and washed and lysed by addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, and protease inhibitors. The intact nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. Nuclei were then resuspended in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). Chromatin was sonicated to fragments containing DNA of an average length of approximately 600 bp. Samples were subjected to centrifugation to remove debris and were precleared by shaking for 1 h with salmon sperm DNA/protein Aagarose (Upstate). After removal of the salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose, supernatants were diluted 10-fold with a dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors), and chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated overnight with antibodies to ASV integrase (rabbit polyclonal), γH2AX (mouse monoclonal) (Upstate), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 (mouse monoclonal) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) proteins. Protein-DNA-antibody complexes were isolated by the addition of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose. After 1 h, complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with a wash buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid). Pellets were eluted with 50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. Clarified samples were incubated with RNase and 5 m NaCl at 67 °C for 4–5 h to reverse cross-links and then precipitated overnight with ethanol. Following centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in proteinase K buffer and treated with proteinase K. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Viral sequences in these fractions were detected by PCR using primers targeting the long terminal repeats. The sequence of the left primer was 5′-ACG TCC AGG GCC CGG AGC GAC-3′, and the right primer was 5′-CTT CAA TGC CCC CAA AAC CAA-3′. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis on an agarose gel and subjected to Southern blotting with a radioactive probe against the ASV long terminal repeat (generated by using random primers and a PCR fragment made with the long terminal repeat probe primers 5′-GAT TGG TGG AAG TAA GGT GG-3′ and 5′-CAA ATG GCG TTT ATT GTA TCG-3′). As a negative control, we used primers targeting the cellular p21 promoter sequences, left, 5′-TTT CCA CCT TTC ACC ATT CC-3′, and right, 5′-GGC AGA TCA CAT ACC CTG TT-3′, with a probe generated by using random primers. Transduction Assays—For infection with the ASV vector (22Katz R.A. Greger J.G. Boimel P. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 13412-13417Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), MEFs were plated at a density of 105 cells/60-mm dish. On the following day, cells were infected in the presence of 5 μg/ml DEAE-dextran. At 8 days postinfection, EGFP-positive cells were counted by flow cytometry. For infection with the HIV-1 vector, MEFs were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate. The following day, cells were infected with an HIV-1 EGFP vector (23Katz R.A. Greger J.G. Darby K. Boimel P. Rall G.F. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5422-5434Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were counted by flow cytometry as with the ASV vector. To determine whether retroviral infection induces formation of γH2AX foci, we infected cells with an amphotropic ASV vector (17Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and examined them by immunofluorescence with an antibody specific for γH2AX. In preliminary experiments (data not included), we observed the formation of γH2AX foci early after infection in DNA repair-proficient human (HeLa and MO59K) and mouse (3T3) cells. As a control, we infected cells with an integration-deficient (IN–) vector (17Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and no increase in foci over background was detected. The data in Fig. 2 and Table I summarize results from subsequent experiments, which included computer-assisted quantitative analyses of γH2AX foci in MO59K cells infected at m.o.i. 10 infectious particles/cell. We again observed an increased number of foci in the infected culture (Fig. 2A), which appeared to peak at 6 h postinfection. A comparison of the distribution of the number of foci/cell in uninfected cells with the number of foci/cell 6 h postinfection is shown in Fig. 2B. The bulk (∼75%) of the uninfected cells contained no or few foci/cell, whereas a small proportion (∼10%) displayed numerous foci, which we speculate may have been caused by replication stress; such cells were also observed in the infected culture. At 6 h postinfection, the infected culture had many fewer cells with no foci, and the percentage of cells with 5–10 foci was substantially higher than in the uninfected culture. As summarized in Table I, this value increased sharply by 4 h postinfection, when integration is expected to begin. The average number of virus-induced foci peaked at 5.1 foci/cell in the 6-h sample and declined again at 8 h postinfection. γH2AX foci are reported (6Redon C. Pilch D. Rogakou E. Sedelnikova O. Newrock K. Bonner W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) to arise within minutes at sites of DNA damage and start to disappear after 30 min, with an ∼2-h half-life as damage is repaired. Assuming similar kinetics, it is likely that some integration-induced foci were both formed and resolved within the 8-h interval monitored in this experiment. A computer simulation using such parameters produced data consistent with the numbers of virus-induced foci/cell in a culture infected at m.o.i. ∼10, at the postinfection time points shown in Table I.Table IQuantitative assessment of γH2AX foci formation in response to retroviral infection in MO59K cellsTime postinfectionPercentage of cells with fociNo. of foci/cellNo. of virus induced foci/cellh0535.20.0 (0.00)aThe numbers in parentheses are from the computer simulation described under “Experimental Procedures.”2515.50.3 (0.26)4928.63.4 (3.41)68810.3bp < 10-6 for this time point.5.1 (4.88)8848.23.0 (3.05)a The numbers in parentheses are from the computer simulation described under “Experimental Procedures.”b p < 10-6 for this time point. Open table in a new tab To verify that H2AX is phosphorylated at sites of retroviral DNA integration, we immunoprecipitated chromatin from nuclear extracts with a γH2AX-specific antibody (ChIP assay) and screened for the presence of viral DNA using PCR. To test the feasibility of this approach, ChIP was first performed at 6 h postinfection of HeLa cells at m.o.i. 0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 infectious particles/cell (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). As expected, antibody specific for integrase protein (positive control) precipitated viral DNA in this extract and in amounts proportional to the m.o.i. An association of viral DNA with the γH2AX immunoprecipitate was also readily detected and, as with integrase, in proportion to the m.o.i. Approximately 10% of the viral DNA was co-immunoprecipitated with γH2AX in this test. Based on the calculated efficiency of the antibody used for these analyses (data not shown), the actual amount of nuclear viral DNA associated with γH2AX in this experiment is estimated to be ∼37% of the total. No association of viral DNA was detected with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase antibody (negative control). In addition, none of the antibodies precipitated sequences corresponding to a region in the cellular p21 promoter (DNA negative control). In this experiment, viral DNA was quantified by Southern blot, but comparable results were obtained with real time PCR (not shown). Because results with m.o.i. 0.1 are clearly in the titratable range for ChIP analysis, this was the condition adopted in the two separate experiments summarized in Fig. 3, B and C. Fig. 3B shows results of ChIP analyses following infection with integration-competent (IN+) or integration-defective (IN–) ASV vectors. A peak of association of γH2AX and viral DNA was observed in the IN+ infection at 6 h postinfection, and no association was detected after infection with the IN– vector. This result demonstrates that γH2AX is associated with nuclear viral DNA only after this DNA is integrated into chromatin. To examine more closely the kinetics of accumulation of γH2AX at integration sites, the amount of viral DNA captured by ChIP at 2-h intervals was determined up to 16 h postinfection (Fig. 3C). Values for each time point were expressed as a percentage of the total viral DNA in the nuclear fraction that is associated with the ChIP at each time, corrected for immunoprecipitation efficiency of the γH2AX antibody. Consistent with our analysis of foci in infected MO59K cells (Table I), these results showed that an association with γH2AX peaks at ∼6h, shortly after viral DNA is detected in the nuclear extract. We estimate that 60% of the nuclear viral DNA in this experiment is associated with γH2AX and therefore is integrated at this time point. From these results, we conclude that γH2AX is a valid marker for sites of retroviral DNA integration. We note that ChIP detects integrated viral DNA both before and after repair (Fig. 1). To examine the functional relevance of H2AX phosphorylation to repair, we performed the transduction assays described below. Because transduced genes are expressed efficiently only from stably integrated proviruses, retroviral transduction is a readout for successful postintegration repair. For example, we have shown that the transduction efficiency of NHEJ-defective DNA-PKcs-deficient murine cells is reduced by 80–90% compared with wild type cells or deficient cells into which DNA-PKcs-expressing DNA was reintroduced (17Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20Daniel R. Greger J. Katz R.A. Taganov K. Wu X. Kappes J.C. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8573-8581Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). As the DNA damage induced by integration cannot be repaired efficiently, most NHEJ-deficient cells are unlikely to survive infection and therefore cannot give rise to stable transductants. To find out whether H2AX phosphorylation is required for postintegration repair, we performed transduction experiments using MEF lines obtained from H2AX knock-out mice and derivatives (24Celeste A. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Kruhlak M.J. Pilch D.R. Staudt D.W. Lee A. Bonner R.F. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 25Celeste A. Difilippantonio S. Difilippantonio M.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Eckhaus M. Ried T. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A. Cell. 2003; 114: 371-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and the ASV-EGFP vector. Results in Table II show that there is no significant difference between the transduction efficiency with H2AX+/+ and H2AX–/– MEFs. Similar results were obtained with a VSV-G protein-pseudo-typed HIV-1 GFP vector (not shown). These data indicate that H2AX deficiency has little or no effect on postintegration repair. One possible explanation for this result is that H2AX function in these cells is redundant. We therefore examined transduction in H2AX–/– MEFs that had been complemented with transgenes that express wild type murine H2AX or proteins carrying either neutral non-modifiable substitutions (S136A/S139A) or negatively charged substitutions that mimic constitutive phosphorylation (S136E/S139E) in the C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related protein kinase target sites of H2AX. No significant difference was observed between the efficiencies of transduction of these lines compared with H2AX–/– cells (Table I). It appears, therefore, that H2AX phosphorylation is dispensable for postintegration repair.Table IITransduction efficiency of H2AX null cells and null cells complemented with H2AX genes carrying mutation of the C-terminal phosphorylation site of this histoneVirus dilutionEGFP-positive cellsH2AX+/+H2AX-/-H2AX-/- + wt H2AXH2AX-/- + S136A/S139AH2AX-/- + S136E/S139E%%%%%10-366.362.059.174.164.110-414.112.111.615.216.010-51.81.21.11.71.6 Open table in a new tab In this study, we show that retroviral infection induces the formation of histone γH2AX foci, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that H2AX phosphorylation occurs at sites of retroviral DNA integration.

We also demonstrate that an H2AX deficiency and an inability to phosphorylate this histone have no detectable effect on the efficiency of retroviral transduction of cultured mouse cell lines. Because efficient expression of transduced genes requires stable retroviral vector integration, we conclude that H2AX phosphorylation is largely dispensable for postintegration repair of chromatin damage.

The study of H2AX-deficient mice has provided further insight into H2AX function. H2AX mice are viable, but DNA repair seems to proceed less efficiently in such animals, which show modest sensitivity to ionizing radiation and impairment in immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (31Reina-San-Martin B.

In keeping with results from the cell-based assays cited above, these mice show no detectable abnormalities in V(D)J recombination (7Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O.

However, the genomic caretaker function of H2AX is more fully exposed when cell cycle checkpoints are compromised because of the absence of p53 (25Celeste A. Difilippantonio S. Difilippantonio M.J.

In a p53–/– background, even H2AX+/– heterozygotes show increased misrepair of DNA damage, leading to the development of immature T- and B-cell lymphomas and solid tumors. Some of the B-cell lymphomas harbor oncogenic translocations with hallmarks of aberrant V(D)J recombination. It appears therefore that, although H2AX is not required for V(D)J recombination, it can suppress misrepair of RAG-dependent DSBs. Based on these and other observations, two general, non-exclusive models have been proposed for γH2AX function. 1) The high concentration of repair proteins recruited to the vicinity of DSBs by or through some action of γH2AX may facilitate repair, especially at low (threshold) levels of damage (30Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I.M. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar); or 2) γH2AX interaction with such proteins might help to hold broken ends together, thereby minimizing the risk of misrepair (25Celeste A. Difilippantonio S. Difilippantonio M.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Eckhaus M. Ried T. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig A.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). According to these models, differential dependency on H2AX is expected, with more dependence on γH2AX for the repair of free DSBs formed by ionizing radiation than for programmed recombination reactions (e.g. V(D)J), in which ends are held in proximity by recombination proteins (35Jones J.M. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15446-15451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). H2AX–/– spermatocytes show severe defects in meiotic X-Y chromosome pairing (12Fernandez-Capetillo O. Mahadevaiah S.K. Celeste A. Romanienko P.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Bonner W.M. Manova K. Burgoyne P. Nussenzweig A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), and as such, it is tempting to speculate that γH2AX plays a bridging function during meiotic recombination. In summary, our studies have produced two important findings. First, they provide direct confirmation that cultured cells respond to retroviral DNA integration in the same way that they respond to DSBs produced by a variety of genotoxic agents or normal programmed events, namely, by massive phosphorylation of histone H2AX in the vicinity of the damage site. The second finding is that H2AX appears to be dispensable for postintegration repair. These observations lend independent support to a model in which the anchoring of broken DNA ends to facilitate their repair is a critical function of γH2AX. Because chromosome breaks are likely to be held together by the RAG1/2 complex during V(D)J recombination and are held covalently by viral DNA in retroviral integration (Fig. 4), such an anchoring function should not be essential in either reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2116402913,"Proteins of many types experience tensile forces in their normal function, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is typical in this. VCAM has seven Ig domains, and each has a disulfide bond (-S–S-) buried in its core that covalently stabilizes about half of each domain against unfolding. VCAM is extended here by single molecule atomic force microscopy in the presence or absence of reducing agents. In the absence of reducing agent, a sawtooth pattern of forced unfolding reveals an average period and total length consistent with disulfide locations in VCAM. With increasing reducing agent, accessible disulfides are specifically reduced (to SH); the average period for unfolding increases up to saturation together with additional metrics of unfolding. Steered molecular dynamics simulations of unfolding indeed show that the core disulfide bond is solvent-exposed in the very earliest stages of protein extension. Michaelis-Menten kinetics emerge with reduction catalyzed by force (τreduction ∼ 10–4 s). The results establish single molecule reduction, one bond at a time, and show that mechanical forces can play a key role in modulating the redox state of cell adhesion proteins that are invariably stressed in cell adhesion."

The SH3 domain of ACK1 binds to the proline-rich region of HSH2, an adaptor protein in hematopoietic cells, leading to its phosphorylation (10Oda T. Muramatsu M.A. Isogai T. Masuho Y. Asano S.

In addition, both DAck and ACK2 interact with the sorting nexin SH3PX1 through their C-terminal domains, leading to its phosphorylation (3Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Clemens J.C. Huddler Jr., D.

The domain architecture of the ACK family is unique compared with other non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and ACK family members are the only tyrosine kinases known to interact with Cdc42 (15Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Members of the ACK family are specific for Cdc42 and do not bind the closely related Rac and Rho GTPases (2Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The 114-kDa human ACK1 protein consists of an N-terminal tyrosine kinase domain; an SH3 domain; and a C-terminal CRIB motif, which is required for Cdc42 binding (15Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, several proline-rich sequences and clathrin-binding motifs are located in the C-terminal region (11Teo M. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18392-18398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All ACK family members share a similar domain structure, although DAck and TNK1 do not contain the CRIB domain. PAK serine/threonine kinases also bind to Cdc42 through a CRIB motif, and this interaction promotes kinase activity (16Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed that the molecular basis for this activation in PAK1 involves release of an intramolecular autoinhibitory module upon Cdc42 binding (17Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). ACK kinases appear functionally similar to PAK kinases in cell-based experiments, in which Cdc42 binding promotes ACK1 activation (8Kato J. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, as the sequence characteristics and domain organization around the CRIB motif are dissimilar in ACK and PAK1, the molecular details of ACK activation by Cdc42 are likely to be different. Additionally, unlike members of the PAK family, Cdc42 is unable to promote the activation of ACKs in vitro (2Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Yokoyama N. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47713-47723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), suggesting that other cellular components may be involved. The ACKs are also the only tyrosine kinases with an SH3 domain C-terminal to the kinase domain. The Src family tyrosine kinases, including Src and Hck, and the Abl tyrosine kinase have SH3 domains (located N-terminal to the kinase domain) that serve as autoinhibitory modules of the unphosphorylated kinase. These kinases can be activated by binding of a protein or peptide to the SH3 domain (20Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T.

Miller W.T. J. Biol.

The SH3 domain might alternatively play a role in protein localization or in substrate recruitment as in other proteins (24Buday L. Biochim. Biophys.

These structures reveal an unusual conformation for the unphosphorylated form of the enzyme and provide insights into both the substrate specificity and methods of inhibition of this tyrosine kinase. Cloning and Expression—Using full-length ACK1 cDNA as a template for subcloning, a set of four PCR primers was designed to amplify the kinase domain of ACK1 (residues 109-395) and to add portions of the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the resulting PCR products, respectively. Denaturation and re-annealing of the resulting PCR products were followed by ligation into a modified pAcGP67 baculovirus DNA transfer vector (Pharmingen) encoding an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (MLLGSHHHHHHGENLYFQGS) for baculovirus generation and cytoplasmic expression in Sf9 insect cells. The DNA sequence of the resulting expression construct was verified by DNA sequencing. Protein expressed from this construct is referred to as His6-ACK1. The DNA transfer vector was cotransfected into adherent Sf9 insect cells cultured in ESF921 protein-free medium (Expression Systems, LLC, Woodland, CA) at 27 °C with BacPak6 linearized viral DNA (Clontech) and BacPak complete medium (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting P1 viral stock was amplified twice to produce the P3 viral stock to be used for large-scale protein production. Sf9 cells cultured in suspension in ESF921 medium were infected at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml using an estimated multiplicity of infection of 0.1 viral particle/cell and were harvested 4 days post-infection. Sf9 cells were removed by centrifugation; the resulting viral stock was filtered to ensure sterility; and 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum was added for viral stability. All viral stocks were stored at 4 °C. The titer of the P2 and P3 viral stocks was determined using a PCR-based Taqman analysis (ABI 7700) and wild-type baculovirus of known titer (Pharmingen) to quantify the number of viral genomes/volume of stock. The titer of the P3 viral stocks used for expression was 8.0 × 108 viral particles/ml. ACK1 was produced at a larger scale in 10-liter batches in stirred tank bioreactors. Sf9 insect cells adapted to growth in protein-free medium were used. The cells were inoculated to a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml from spinner flasks into bioreactors. Fermentation was performed at 27 °C in ESF921 medium, and the dissolved oxygen level was controlled at 50% of air saturation using sparged oxygen on demand and continuous headspace aeration. The bioreactors were operated at 100 rpm agitation using two pitched blade impellers. After the cells grew to the infection point (a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml over a period of 48 h), they were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 0.5 plaqueforming units/cell. The cells were monitored for signs of infection (cessation of growth, increase in cell diameter) and were grown for an additional 72 h. The resultant biomass was chilled to 15 °C in the bioreactor, harvested by centrifugation, and rapidly frozen on dry ice and ethanol for storage at -80 °C prior to analysis and purification. Purification—His6-ACK1 biomass was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaVO4, 10 mm NaF, 15 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitor mixture pellets (Roche Applied Science). The cells were disrupted by homogenization and spun at 185,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc.) for 1 h before pouring the mixture into a gravity column. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer, 5 column volumes of column buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 30 mm imidazole, and another 5 column volumes of column buffer containing 50 mm imidazole. His6-ACK1 was eluted in a single step using column buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the highest amount of His6-ACK1 were buffer-exchanged to remove the imidazole before adding His6-tobacco etch virus protease at a 1:10 weight ratio of protease to His6-ACK1. After overnight incubation at room temperature, the mixture was adjusted to a final NaCl concentration of 500 mm before incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The resin was washed in a gravity column with 10 column volumes of column buffer supplemented with NaCl and imidazole to final concentrations of 500 mm NaCl and 15 mm imidazole. Cleaved ACK1 had some affinity for the resin and was eluted using column buffer containing 100 mm imidazole, whereas the His6 tag and the His6-tobacco etch virus protease remained bound to the resin. The fractions containing cleaved ACK1 were combined and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. For the final step, ACK1 was purified by size exclusion on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences). Crystallization—All crystals were grown at 18 °C in sitting drops by vapor diffusion using 1.5 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of apo-ACK1K were obtained by mixing protein at 4 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine with a reservoir solution of 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 200 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Addition of apo-ACK1K microcrystals to the reservoir solution before mixing with the protein solution aided in the growth of single crystals. The seeds were prepared by vortexing apo crystals in a seed bead kit (Hampton Research). Crystals of ACK1K with AMP-PCP were grown by mixing 4 mg/ml ACK1K in 2 mm AMP-PCP, 15 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 5 mm MgCl2 with a reservoir solution of 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.5), and 100 mm LiSO4. Crystals typically grew to dimensions of ∼100 × 200 × 50 μm in 1-4 days and were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions consisting of the reservoir solution supplemented with 200 mm NaCl and 15% ethylene glycol before being flash-cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The ACK1K·debromohymenialdisine complex was obtained from apo crystals soaked in solutions containing the compound. In this case, apo crystals were grown by mixing 3 mg/ml ACK1K in 20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a reservoir solution of 23-25% polyethylene glycol 2000, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 200 mm MgCl2. These apo crystals were soaked overnight at 18 °C in the reservoir solution supplemented with 3% (v/v) 10 mm debromohymenialdisine (in dimethyl sulfoxide) and 300 mm NaCl before being cryoprotected as described above. Data Collection and Processing—X-ray data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beamlines 7-1 and 11-1 on a single crystal each of apo-ACK1K and the AMP-PCP complex, respectively, and at the Advanced Light Source on beamline 5.0.1 on a single crystal of the debromohymenialdisine complex. The apo and debromohymenialdisine complex diffraction data were integrated with MOSFLM (26Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA (27Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), whereas the AMP-PCP complex data set was processed with d*TREK as implemented in CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX). The apo and debromohymenialdisine complex data sets belong to space group P21, with two molecules/asymmetric unit, whereas the AMP-PCP complex belongs to space group C2, also with two molecules/asymmetric unit. There is no obvious crystal packing relationship between the P21 and C2 crystal forms. Structure Solution and Refinement—All structures were solved by molecular replacement using either EPMR (29Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) or MOLREP (30Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar) as implemented in CCP4 Version 4.2.2 (27Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). For the apo structure, a polyserine model (conserved alanines and glycines intact) of the C-terminal domain of the Hck kinase domain (residues 343-518, with activation loop residues 404-432 omitted) was used as a search model (Protein Data Bank code 1QCF). EPMR found two moderate solutions in a search using all data between 15 and 4 Å. The first was found with a correlation coefficient of 0.191 and an R-factor of 0.622 and was held static as a partial solution, resulting in a second solution being found with a total correlation coefficient of 0.279 and an R-factor of 0.587. The model was subsequently refined in REFMAC (31Murdushov G.N. Dodson E.J. Vagin A.A. Proc. Daresbury Study Weekend. 1996; : 93-104Google Scholar) using rigid body refinement and maximum likelihood procedures. The resulting electron density map showed clear electron density for a number of amino acid side chains unique to ACK1. A series of iterative cycles of manual rebuilding in QUANTA (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) and refinement with REFMAC, followed by an additional molecular replacement search with the improved model, led to complete building of both the N- and C-terminal lobes in the two copies (molecules A and B) of the molecule. After the protein model was nearly complete, initial waters were built with ARP_WATERS (33Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The final solvent structure was built and visually inspected in QUANTA. The refined model contains 512 residues and 230 water molecules. Several areas in both molecules were unable to be modeled because of weak electron density. These include N-terminal residues 109-116, residues 134-137 of the nucleotide-binding loop, and the residues between strand β3 and helix αC (residues 160-167 in molecule A and residues 160-170 in molecule B). In addition, several residues in the molecule A activation loop (residues 280 and 287-291) and the C-terminal residues in both molecules (residues 390-395 in molecule A and residues 391-395 in molecule B) were not modeled. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1U46). For both the AMP-PCP and debromohymenialdisine complexes, two molecules were found by molecular replacement using a single apo monomer as a search model, with all non-protein atoms removed. The solutions were subsequently rigid body-refined using maximum likelihood protocols in REFMAC. At this stage, electron density was seen for two molecules of ligand in each data set. The protein models were iteratively improved by manual building in QUANTA, followed by refinement in REFMAC. All ligands were placed into the Fo - Fc map using QUANTA/X-LIGAND. For the debromohymenialdisine complex, the initial solvent structure was built with ARP_WATERS. For the AMP-PCP complex, which was at lower resolution, waters were added by hand in QUANTA. During the last stages of refinement of the AMP-PCP complex, TLS restraints (34Howlin B. Butler S.A. Moss D.S. Harris G.W. Driessen H.P.C. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 622-624Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar) were added, with each lobe defined as a TLS group, which resulted in a decrease in Rfree of 2%. The final ACK1K·AMP-PCP model contains 523 residues and 10 water molecules, whereas the final ACK1K·debromohymenialdisine model contains 520 residues and 157 water molecules. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1U54 and 1U4D for the AMP-PCP and debromohymenialdisine complexes, respectively). All figures were prepared with the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Overview of the Apo Structure—The structure of unphosphorylated ACK1K was determined from 2.0-Å resolution diffraction data, collected from crystals that were determined to belong to the monoclinic space group P21 (Table I). The asymmetric unit of these crystals contains two molecules of ACK1K (molecules A and B). The two molecules are very similar, with a global C-α r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å. The structure is consistent with the typical bilobate protein kinase fold: a smaller, mostly β-sheet N-terminal lobe and a larger, mostly α-helical C-terminal lobe are connected by a short peptide linker region (residues 206-210). The nucleotide-binding pocket is formed by a cleft between the two lobes. The N-terminal lobe of ACK1K consists of six β-strands (β1-β6) and one α-helix (αC), whereas the C-terminal lobe contains seven short β-strands (β7-β13) and seven α-helices (αD-αI and αEF) (Fig. 1).Table IData collection and refinement statistics for the ACK1K structuresACK1K structureApoAMP-PCPDebromohymenialdisineSpace groupP21C2P21Unit cell (a, b, c (Å)); β (°)81.2, 43.4, 84.5; 111.8200.4, 42.3, 70.9; 96.381.6, 42.9, 85.1; 112Resolution (Å)30 to 2.039 to 2.847 to 2.1Rsym0.078 (0.530)aValues in parentheses indicate the highest resolution shell.0.058 (0.319)0.059 (0.373)Completeness (%)100.0 (100.0)98.3 (97.8)99.7 (99.7)Multiplicity3.8 (3.8)3.6 (3.6)3.5 (3.4)Average I/σ(I)11.8 (2.8)12.9 (3.7)14.6 (2.6)R-factor0.199 (0.248)0.222 (0.239)0.2025 (0.247)RfreebRfree was calculated with a randomly chosen 5% of the data.0.249 (0.345)0.322 (0.352)0.248 (0.325)r.m.s.d. bonds (Å)0.0200.0190.019r.m.s.d. angles1.705°1.97°1.81°a Values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution shell.b Rfree was calculated with a randomly chosen 5% of the data. Open table in a new tab The most closely related kinase for which a structure is available is the EGFR kinase domain (EGFRK) (Protein Data Bank code 1M14) (36Stamos J. Sliwkowski M.X. Eigenbrot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46265-46272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The kinase domains of ACK1 and EGFR are 39% identical in sequence, and the r.m.s.d. is 1.1 Å when 237 of 252 possible C-α pairs are superimposed. Comparison of the ACK1K structure with EGFRK and other active kinase structures, including phosphorylated LCK (lymphocyte-specific kinase; Protein Data Bank code 3LCK) (37Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), suggests that ACK1K is in an active conformation. Examination of the area surrounding the ATP-binding site reveals that the relative positions of residues known to be critical for catalytic activity correspond to those seen in active kinases. These include the catalytic residue Asp252 and the residues involved in coordinating magnesium, Asn257 (catalytic loop) and Asp270 (activation loop). Additionally, the helix αC is positioned such that the side chain of Glu177 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the Lys158 side chain, facilitating formation of the conserved salt bridge indicative of an active kinase. This salt bridge is formed in molecule B, whereas the lysine side chain is partially disordered in molecule A. The N- and C-terminal lobes of the two molecules have a slightly different juxtaposition, with molecule B in a more “closed” conformation by ∼2°. It is presumed that this slight difference in conformation is simply the result of the crystalline environment and represents the lack of crystallographic symmetry between the two protein molecules. Residues 134-137 of the nucleotide-binding loop are disordered in both molecules. The activation loop, which modulates catalytic activity in many protein kinases by alternating between inactive and active states in response to the phosphorylation state (38Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), is well ordered in unphosphorylated ACK1K and adopts an “active” conformation generally observed only in phosphorylated protein kinases. Several unusual features of the ACK1K activation loop appear to stabilize the active conformation (discussed below). This active conformation is in direct contrast to several tyrosine kinases that have unphosphorylated autoinhibitory activation loop structures. In IRK (insulin receptor kinase) and the muscle-specific kinase MuSK, the conserved sequence Asp-Phe-Gly (which initiates the activation loop) occupies the ATP-binding pocket, blocking the catalytic function of the Asp residue and preventing ATP binding (39Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 40Till J.H. Becerra M. Watty A. Lu Y. Ma Y. Neubert T.A. Burden S.J. Hubbard S.R. Structure (Lond.). 2002; 10: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, the unphosphorylated activation loop occupies the substrate-binding site (41Mohammadi M. Froum S. Hamby J.M. Schroeder M.C. Panek R.L. Lu G.H. Eliseenkova A.V. Green D. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5896-5904Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In contrast, the unphosphorylated activation loop of ACK1K blocks neither the ATP- nor substrate-binding site and positions the Asp-Phe-Gly segment of the activation loop in a catalytically competent conformation. Structure of ACK1K Bound to a Nucleotide Analog—To examine the effects of nucleotide binding on the structure of ACK1K, crystals were grown in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog (AMP-PCP). The protein preparation used in the experiment contained a small amount of +1 phosphoprotein as indicated by mass spectroscopy (data not shown). The +1 phosphoprotein was most likely produced during fermentation and was co-purified with the +0 form of the protein. Crystals were obtained that belong to space group C2 and that diffract to 2.8 Å (Table I). The asymmetric unit contains two molecules of ACK1K (molecules A and B). In molecule A, clear electron density was observed for a phosphorylated"

So far, four homologous subunits of mammalian ENaC have been isolated and are denoted as α, β, γ, and δ. The chemical agents acting on ENaC are, however, largely unknown, except for amiloride and benzamil as ENaC inhibitors. In particular, there are no agonists currently known that are selective for ENaCδ, which is mainly expressed in the brain. Here we demonstrate that capsazepine, a competitive antagonist for transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1, potentiates the activity of human ENaCδβγ (hENaCδβγ) heteromultimer expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The inward currents at a holding potential of –60 mV in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes were markedly enhanced by the application of capsazepine (≥1 μm), and the capsazepine-induced current was mostly abolished by the addition of 100 μm amiloride. The stimulatory effects of capsazepine on the inward current were concentration-dependent with an EC50 value of 8 μm. Neither the application of other vanilloid compounds (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, and olvanil) nor a structurally related compound (dopamine) modulated the inward current. Although hENaCδ homomer was also significantly activated by capsazepine, unexpectedly, capsazepine had no effect on hENaCα and caused a slight decrease on the hENaCαβγ current. In conclusion, capsazepine acts on ENaCδ and acts together with protons. Other vanilloids tested do not have any effect.

ENaCα is expressed mainly in epithelia, such as the kidney, lung, and colon, and binds with these β and γ subunits to play a pathophysiological role (2Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K.

More recently, we have demonstrated that protons activate ENaCδ, indicating that it may contribute to pH sensation and/or pH regulation in the human brain (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the expressed sequence tag and genome project data bases show that an ENaCδ gene has been found only in humans and chimpanzees (GenBank™ accession numbers U38254 and O46547, respectively), and there is no evidence of the orthologues in rats and mice. The corresponding genomic assignments of ENaCδ were identified on human chromosome 1p36.3-p36.2 (12Waldmann R. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Mattei M. Genomics. 1996; 34: 262-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The functional expression and activity of ENaC are regulated by various endogenous and exogenous compounds. It has been described that aldosterone increases the transcription of serine/threonine kinase, and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase to reduce Nedd4-2-mediated degradation of ENaCαβγ, leading to the increased expression of ENaCαβγ at the cell surface (13Chen S.Y.

On the other hand, ENaCδβγ can bind with a copper transporter, Murr1, by interacting at the C-terminal domain of ENaCδ to decrease the activity of the channel (17Biasio W. Chang T. McIntosh C.J.

In pharmacological profiles of ENaC, it is well known that the potassium-sparing diuretics, amiloride and benzamil, inhibit the activities of ENaCα, ENaCδ, and the complexes with β and γ subunits (6Canessa C.M.

Weber W.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to the relatively well documented ENaCαβγ in pharmacological studies, it has been poorly investigated for ENaCδ. In particular, chemical activators for ENaCδ have not yet been reported. In this investigation, the effects of capsazepine on human ENaC (hENaC) current were examined by using electrophysiological analyses in the Xenopus oocytes expression system. Capsazepine, which possesses a vanilloid moiety, has been developed as a synthetic competitive antagonist for the transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily 1 (TRPV1) (21Bevan S. Hothi S.

Here we show that capsazepine activates hENaCδβγ in a concentration-dependent manner, although other vanilloids (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, and olvanil) were not affected on the hENaCδβγ current. Most interestingly, capsazepine causes potentiation of the hENaCδ current but not hENaCα activity. To our knowledge, capsazepine is the first agonist to activate ENaCδ. Molecular Biology—All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Human samples free from neurological disorders were taken within 24 h after death with permission from the families of the deceased. Ethical principles and considerations were observed regarding forensic and related research using human organs and fluids obtained from autopsies. Human tissues were rapidly frozen on dry ice immediately after their removal at autopsy and were kept at –80 °C until use. The total RNA was extracted from homogenates of human tissues using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), following digestion with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI). The reverse transcription (RT) was performed as follows. We heated the reaction mixture of total RNA (3 μg) and 500 ng of an oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen) in 8 μl of diethyl bicarbonate-treated water at 70 °C for 10 min, chilled it for 1 min, added 11 μl of the reaction buffer (as a final concentration, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm individual dNTPs), and incubated it at 50 °C for 2 min. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 90 min after the addition of 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and then heated at 70 °C for 15 min. After this RT procedure, we added 80 μl of distilled water to the reaction mixture and used it for PCR. To isolate the full-length ENaCs from human skin (for α, β, and γ subunits) or brain (for δ subunit) cDNA, oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: for hENaCα (GenBank™ accession number X76180), +, 5′-gaa ttc gcc gcc acc ATG GAG GGG AAC AAG CTG GAG GAG CAG GAC T-3′, and –,5′-tct aga TCA GGG CCC CCC CAG AGG ACA GGT GGA GGA ACT GGC CCC T-3′; for hENaCβ (X87159), +, 5′-gat atc gcc gcc acc ATG CAC GTG AAG AAG TAC CTG CTG AAG GGC CT-3′, and –,5′-tct aga TTA GAT GGC ATC ACC CTC ACT GTC AGA CTC GAT GAC GTC CA-3′; for hENaCγ (U48937), +, 5′-gaa ttc gcc gcc acc ATG GCC CCC GGG GAG AAG ATC AAA GCC A-3′, and –, 5′-tct aga TCA GAG CTC ATC CAG CAT CTG GGT ATC TGT GAG CT-3′; for hENaCδ (U38254), +,5′-gaa ttc gcc gcc acc ATG GCT GAG CAC CGA AGC ATG GAC GGG AGA-3′, and –, 5′-tct aga TCA GGT GTC CAG AGT CTC AAG GGG CTG GGG CCC AGC CCA GCT-3′. The sequences indicated by lowercase letters are EcoRI (gaa ttc), EcoRV (gat atc), XbaI (tct aga) recognition sites, and the Kozak sequence (gcc gcc acc), which were added to the insert PCR products into vector DNA in the proper orientation and to promote effective translation, respectively. The RT reaction product (2 μl) was amplified using GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl of a solution containing 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm individual dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 15 pmol of sense and antisense primers for each, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). The thermal cycler program used for PCR amplification included a 0.5-min denaturation step at 94 °C, a 0.5-min annealing step at 58 °C, and a 2-min primer extension step at 72 °C after a preheating step at 94 °C for 9 min. The amplification was performed for 45 cycles. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was heated at 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel in Tris acetate/EDTA buffer, recovered from the gel fragments, cloned, and sequenced. Xenopus Oocyte Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological studies in Xenopus oocytes, using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique, were performed as described previously (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In brief, cRNA(s) (2 ng for homomeric channel or each 0.02 ng for co-expression) was injected into Xenopus oocytes, whereas the control oocytes were injected with an equal volume of diethyl dicarbonate-treated water, described as native throughout. After injection, oocytes were incubated at 20 °C in a recording solution supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin G, 20 μg/ml streptomycin, and either 10 (for hENaCα and αβγ) or 100 μm (for hENaCδ and δβγ) amiloride for 24–48 h before electrophysiological recordings. The recording solution had an ionic composition of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH. The recording solution for pH experiments was prepared with the equivalent MES (pKa = 6.15) instead of HEPES (pKa = 7.55) and adjusted to a suitable pH with either NaOH or HCl. All electrophysiological recordings were performed at a holding potential of –60 mV. The current-voltage relationships were measured by using a ramp protocol from –100 to 50 mV for 30 s. The recording chamber was continuously perfused with solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. All electrophysiological experiments were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). Statistics—Pooled data are shown as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance between two groups and among groups was determined by Student's t test and Scheffé's test after one-way analysis of variance, respectively. Significant difference is expressed in the figures (** or ##, p < 0.01). The data of the relationship between either capsazepine or proton concentrations and current responses were fitted by using the following equation after normalization by the maximum current amplitude (see Figs. 3B and 6): I/Imax (%) = 100/{1 + (Kd/[A])n}, where Imax is the maximum amplitude of the capsazepine- or proton-evoked current; Kd is the apparent dissociation constant of capsazepine or protons; [A] is the concentration of capsazepine or protons, and n is the Hill coefficient.Fig. 6Sensitization by capsazepine of proton-activated hENaCδβγ current. The effects of capsazepine on the proton-activated hENaCδβγ current in Xenopus oocytes were examined. A, in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes, the pH responsiveness from 7.5 to 4.0 in the absence (open) and presence (closed) of 1 μm capsazepine (CZ), which by itself had a very small effect on the hENaCδβγ current, is plotted. The addition of capsazepine sensitized the proton activation of hENaCδβγ current from the half-maximal pH of 5.9 ± 0.1 (Hill coefficient of 0.35 ± 0.02) to pH 6.3 ± 0.1 (Hill coefficient of 0.42 ± 0.02). B, the effects of weak acidification to pH 7.0, which is the subthreshold concentration of protons on the hENaCδβγ current, on capsazepine-induced currents are summarized. The decrease in pH from 7.5 (open) to 7.0 (closed) caused a left shift of the dose-response curve for capsazepine from the EC50 of 8.3 ± 0.6 μm (Hill coefficient of 1.4 ± 0.1) to 2.4 ± 0.2 μm (Hill coefficient of 1.0 ± 0.1). Experimental data were obtained from 10 oocytes for each.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of hENaCδβγ Current by Capsazepine—The effects of capsazepine, a well known competitive antagonist for TRPV1 (21Bevan S.

Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar), on the hENaCδβγ current were examined using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. When hENaCδβγ heteromultimer was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, an inward current was induced at a holding potential of –60 mV, and the current was mostly inhibited by 100 μm amiloride (Fig. 1A). The mean amplitude of the amiloride-sensitive inward current in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes was 615 ± 24 nA (n = 54, p < 0.01 versus native of 1 ± 1 nA, n = 17). In hENaCδβγ-injected oocytes, the application of 10 μm capsazepine was markedly increased in the inward current by 785 ± 42 nA (n = 26, p < 0.01). The current increase by capsazepine was recovered to the resting level by the removal of capsazepine in all hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes tested (n = 26). After washout for a few minutes, the re-addition of capsazepine caused current activation with similar amplitude and kinetics to first challenge (n = 6). The current-voltage relationship showed that the application of 10 μm capsazepine enhanced the channel activity at all voltages examined in hENaCδβγ-expressed oocytes (n = 4; Fig. 1B). On the other hands, in native oocytes, the application of 10 μm capsazepine did not induce any current (n = 14), because the capsazepine-induced currents were mediated by the activation of ENaCδβγ. Effects of Amiloride on Capsazepine-induced Current—To confirm whether the capsazepine-induced current originated from ENaCδβγ expression, the effects of amiloride, an inhibitor of ENaCs, on the inward current in the presence of capsazepine were examined. The 10 μm capsazepine-induced current in hENaCδβγ-injected oocytes (1570 ± 53 nA, n = 26) was dramatically blocked by the addition of 100 μm amiloride (88 ± 1% decrease, n = 26, p < 0.01 versus capsazepine) and, moreover, significantly inhibited the current to 194 ± 20 nA (n = 26, p < 0.01 versus the initial resting current of 785 ± 33 nA; Fig. 2). In native oocytes, the current amplitudes after the application of 10 μm capsazepine in the absence and presence of 100 μm amiloride (65 ± 4 nA and 66 ± 4 nA, respectively, n = 14) were not significant to the initial resting current (64 ± 4 nA, n = 14, p > 0.05). Dose Dependence of Current Activation by Capsazepine—The concentration dependence of capsazepine-induced current was examined in hENaCδβγ-expressed oocytes. In hENaCδβγ-expressed oocytes, changing the concentration of capsazepine ranged from 0.01 to 100 μm, which showed that the inward current was significantly increased by capsazepine at a concentration of 1 μm and more (n = 7, p < 0.05 versus control of 703 ± 79 nA), and the enhancement was in a concentration-dependent manner (2346 ± 153 nA at 100 μm, n = 7; Fig. 3). The EC50 value of capsazepine on the inward currents was 7.8 μm, and the Hill coefficient was 1.3. Effects of Capsazepine-related Compounds on hENaCδβγ Currents—Capsazepine possesses a vanilloid moiety, which is a key factor for the binding for TRPV1 (24Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol.

To examine whether the opening action for ENaCδβγ was shared by structurally related compounds of capsazepine, the effects of capsazepine-related compounds on the inward current were measured in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes. The change in current amplitude after exposure to the following compounds at a concentration of 10–100 μm for 5 min in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes is shown in Fig. 4: vanilloid compounds were 30 μm capsaicin, 10 μm resiniferatoxin, and 30 μm olvanil; the antagonist of a nonselective cation channel containing TRPV1 was 30 μm ruthenium red; and the molecule structurally similar to capsazepine was 100 μm dopamine. Regardless of this, the inward current was markedly enhanced by 30 μm capsazepine as shown in Fig. 3 (n = 6, p < 0.01), and the effects of other compounds were not statistically significant (n = 6 for each, p > 0.05). Selective Activation of hENaCδ Not hENaCα by Capsazepine—It was examined whether the activation of the inward current by capsazepine was mediated through either ENaCδ alone or the accessory β or γ subunits. When the hENaCδ homomer was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, a 100 μm amiloride-sensitive inward current was induced at –60 mV (69 ± 6 nA, n = 5; Fig. 5A), as described previously (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The application of 30 μm capsazepine significantly evoked an inward current in hENaCδ-expressing oocytes (by 67 ± 3 nA, n = 5, p < 0.01), as well as in hENaCδβγ-injected oocytes (by 1133 ± 80 nA, n = 21, p < 0.01; Fig. 5). Furthermore, we tested whether capsazepine was effective on another ENaC core unit, the α subunit, in Xenopus oocytes. When the hENaCα homomer or αβγ heteromultimer was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, these inward currents induced at –60 mV were mostly blocked by lower amiloride at 10 μm (Fig. 5A). The mean amplitude of the amiloride-sensitive current in hENaCα- and αβγ-expressed oocytes at –60 mV was 34 ± 9 nA (n = 6) and 822 ± 54 nA (n = 11), respectively. Unexpectedly, in contrast to hENaCδ and δβγ, the application of 30 μm capsazepine had no effect on the inward currents in hENaCα-expressing oocytes (by 5 ± 5 nA decrease, n = 6, p > 0.05), and moreover, the hENaCαβγ current was slightly decreased by 30 μm capsazepine (by 71 ± 5 nA, n = 11, p < 0.01). Sensitization by Capsazepine on Proton-activated hENaCδβγ Current—We reported previously (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that ENaCδ activity was enhanced by external protons in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Therefore, the effects of capsazepine on proton-activated hENaCδβγ current in Xenopus oocytes were examined. In hENaCδβγ-expressed oocytes, the gradual decrease in pH from 7.5 to 4.0 resulted in significantly increased currents in a proton concentration-dependent manner (2279 ± 92 nA, pH 4.0, n = 10, p < 0.01 versus control of 821 ± 69 nA; Fig. 6A). The half-maximal pH for activation of the hENaCδβγ current was 5.9 ± 0.1, and the Hill coefficient was 0.35 ± 0.02 (n = 10). In the presence of 1 μm capsazepine, which by itself had a very small effect on hENaCδβγ current (by 144 ± 20 nA, n = 10; see Figs. 3 and 6B), the dose-response curve for protons on hENaCδβγ currents was shifted to the left (half-maximal pH of 6.3 ± 0.1 and Hill coefficient of 0.42 ± 0.02, n = 10). The maximum amplitude of the acid-evoked current in the presence of 1 μm capsazepine (by 1502 ± 102 nA, n = 10) was not statistically significant with that in the absence of capsazepine (by 1458 ± 117 nA, n = 10, p > 0.05). Inversely, the dose response to capsazepine was strongly potentiated by weak acidification to pH 7.0 (Fig. 6B), which was a subthreshold concentration of protons on hENaCδβγ current (by 25 ± 4 nA, n = 10; see Fig. 5A). The decrease in pH from 7.5 to 7.0 caused a left shift of the dose-response curve for capsazepine from the EC50 value of 8.3 ± 0.6 μm (Hill coefficient of 1.4 ± 0.1, n = 10) to 2.4 ± 0.2 μm (Hill coefficient of 1.0 ± 0.1, n = 10). The maximum response of the capsazepine-induced current during the exposure to pH 7.0 (by 1574 ± 122 nA, n = 10) was not statistically significant to that in pH 7.5 medium (by 1566 ± 130 nA, n = 10, p > 0.05). Amiloride-sensitive ENaCs, members of the degenerin/ENaC superfamily, regulate essential control elements for Na+ homeostasis into cells and across epithelia. The heteromultimeric ENaCαβγ complex is expressed mainly in epithelia such as the kidney, lung, and colon to play a pathophysiological role (2Alvarez de la Rosa D. Canessa C.M. Fyfe G.K. Zhang P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 573-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that homomeric ENaCδ is widely distributed throughout the brain and is activated by protons, indicating that it may act as a pH sensor in the human brain (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In pharmacological aspects, the chemical agents for ENaCα are well documented, although those for ENaCδ are largely unknown except for amiloride and benzamil as ENaC inhibitors. In particular, no chemical activators have been reported for ENaCδ to date. In this investigation, the effects of capsazepine, a well known competitive TRPV1 antagonist (21Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G.

Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar), on hENaCδβγ were examined by electrophysiological studies in the Xenopus oocytes expression system. We have found that the application of capsazepine activates hENaCδβγ in a concentration-dependent manner, and the enhancement is sensitive to amiloride. The most interesting finding in this investigation is that capsazepine activated the hENaCδ current but not hENaCα activity. When the heteromultimeric hENaCδβγ complex was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the application of capsazepine at a concentration of 1 μm and more was markedly increased by an inward current. Because the capsazepine-induced current was significantly abolished by the addition of 100 μm amiloride, an inhibitor of ENaCs, in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes, and capsazepine-evoked currents were not observed in native oocytes, the capsazepine-induced currents originated from the ENaCδβγ expression. The capsazepine-induced current was maintained at a steady level during capsazepine application in hENaCδβγ-expressed oocytes (see Fig. 2A). It is exciting that the chemical agonists for the ion channel induce sensitization or desensitization of its activity, such as capsaicin for TRPV1 (23Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar) and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate for TRPV1 and TRPV3 (27Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K.

Suzuki M. Caterina M.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5177-5182Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). After washout for a few minutes, the sequential challenge of capsazepine causes current activation to the same extent as the first trial in hENaCδβγ-expressing oocytes (see Fig. 1A). These results indicate that capsazepine did not induce sensitization and desensitization to the activity of hENaCδβγ under these conditions. The sensitivity to capsazepine was increased in a weak acidic medium of pH 7.0. Protons are activated the hENaCδ current (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Ji H.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26939-26947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but pH 7.0 is the subthreshold concentration of protons in the hENaCδβγ current. At this proton concentration, the dose response for capsazepine on the inward currents was enhanced, indicating that the effect of capsazepine was sensitized by the addition of protons. Inversely, the pH dependence of hENaCδβγ was shifted to the left by the lower concentration of capsazepine (1 μm), which by itself had a very small effect on hENaCδβγ current. Similar shifts in sensitivity by the mixture of two different ligands are observed in some ion channels such as TRPV1 (23Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6875) Google Scholar, 27Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). These results indicate that capsazepine acts synergistically with protons, an activating factor of ENaCδ. It is still unknown whether the mechanism of channel activation by capsazepine is similar to that by protons. The similarity to the responses to capsazepine and protons in ENaCδ (activation by both stimuli) and ENaCα (partially inhibition) may be a key point for elucidating the mechanism underlying the channel modulation. Capsazepine has been developed as a synthetic competitive antagonist at TRPV1 (21Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G. James I.F. Rang H.P. Shah K. Walpole C.S. Yeats J.C. Br. J.

In a variety of bioassays in vitro and in vivo, capsazepine is effective against both capsaicin- and resiniferatoxin-evoked responses (21Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G. James I.F. Rang H.P. Shah K.

Capsazepine at micromolar concentrations, which are necessary to inhibit capsaicin-evoked responses in most tissues, also blocks voltage-dependent calcium channels (29Docherty R.J. Yeats J.C. Piper A.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1461-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30Kuenzi F.M. Dale N. Br. J.

Lett. 1997; 228: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that capsazepine protects against neuronal injury caused by oxygen glucose deprivation by inhibiting hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cation channel current (32Ray A.M. Benham C.D. Roberts J.C. Gill C.H. Lanneau C. Gitterman D.P. Harries M. Davis J.B. Davies C.H. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10146-10153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits the transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily 8 (33Behrendt H.J. Germann T. Gillen C. Hatt H. Jostock R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition to its competitive antagonism of TRPV1 and its inhibitory actions on these channels, in this investigation we have clarified that capsazepine activates hENaCδβγ with an EC50 of 8 μm, providing us with a novel target for drug development and screening in the degenerin/ENaC superfamily. A vanilloid structure containing capsazepine is a key factor for acting on TRPV1 (24Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jordt S.E. Julius D.

Therefore, it was examined whether the vanilloid structure contributed to the mechanism underlying the activation of hENaCδβγ. No activation was observed in response to vanilloid compounds (capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, and olvanil), an antagonist for nonselective cation channel (ruthenium red), and a molecule structurally similar to capsazepine (dopamine) at the concentration of 10–100 μm in hENaCδβγ-injected oocytes. In contrast, the application of capsazepine significantly activated the hENaCδβγ current. These results suggest that ENaCδβγ activation by capsazepine may be independent of the vanilloid structure. The most interesting finding in this investigation was that capsazepine activated hENaCδ but not hENaCα. The homomeric hENaCδ, as well as hENaCδβγ, was activated by capsazepine, indicating that capsazepine acts directly on ENaCδ itself. The extent to the activation in hENaCδ alone (1.6 ± 0.1-fold by 30 μm capsazepine, n = 5) was significantly smaller than that in hENaCδβγ (2.6 ± 0.2-fold, n = 21, p < 0.05), suggesting that the accessory β and/or γ subunit(s) may modulate the channel current activated by capsazepine. Another ENaC core unit, human α subunit with 37% amino acid identity to δ subunit, failed to increase the current amplitude by the application of capsazepine, and unexpectedly, capsazepine caused a slight reduction of the hENaCαβγ current. It has been described that there are differences in Na+ permeability (α:δ = ∼2:0.6 as ILi+/INa+) and the amiloride sensitivity (α:δ = 0.1:2.6 μm as IC50) between α and δ subunits (4Kellenberger S.

Because the chemical agents influencing strongly either the α or δ subunit have been poorly investigated, capsazepine is a potentially powerful tool for the electrophysiological analysis of ENaCδ and the elucidation of the clinical ENaCδ function in humans. In conclusion, we found that capsazepine acts selectively on ENaCδ rather than ENaCα and causes the activation of ENaCδ, showing that capsazepine is the first known activator for ENaCδ. In addition to the function of ENaCδ as a pH sensor in human brain as described previously (11Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Nagao M. Shimada S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this finding in our study provides a starting point for a number of exciting follow up investigations into the physiological and pathological roles of ENaCδ in vitro and in vivo in humans.

A stringent quality control process prevents export of orphan subunits of oligomeric complexes, folding-incompetent products of mutated genes, and by-products of protein biosynthesis that do not acquire the native conformation (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 2Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Polypeptides that do not pass quality control are either retained by the ER chaperone network to be used for further folding attempts or are sorted out for cytosolic degradation. The mechanisms regulating ER quality control are better understood for N-glycosylated polypeptides. N-glycans are added to asparagines in nascent chains as pre-assembled tri-antennary oligosaccharides composed of three terminal glucoses, nine mannoses, and two N-acetylglucosamines. The two outermost glucoses are rapidly trimmed by ER glucosidases I and II. Polypeptides exposing mono-glucosylated intermediates of N-glycan trimming associate with the ER lectins calnexin (Cnx) and calreticulin (Crt). The opposing actions of glucosidase II that trim the innermost glucose residue (thereby releasing the newly synthesized polypeptide from Cnx/Crt) and of UDP-glucose-glycoprotein glucosyltransferase that adds back one glucose to non-native conformers sending them back to Cnx/Crt, drive the so-called Cnx cycle (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 2Trombetta E.S. Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). For folding-incompetent and terminally misfolded glycopolypeptides, termination of unproductive folding attempts coincides with their definitive release from the Cnx cycle and deviation into the ERAD machinery. Interruption of unproductive folding attempts is a crucial step of ER quality control because it prevents clogging of the ER chaperone system. Emerging evidence underscores the importance of a tightly controlled extraction of folding-incompetent glycopolypeptides from the Cnx cycle to promote their degradation. Extraction is regulated by the ER α-mannosidase I (4Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and by EDEM (ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (5Hosokawa N. Wada I. Hasegawa K.

Mannose trimming makes glucosidase-mediated protein deglucosylation (8Grinna L.S. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) less efficient. This slows down the on/off cycles of substrate binding to/release from Cnx. Moreover, N-glycans with a reduced number of mannoses if coupled to misfolded protein determinants may serve for association with EDEM. Mannose trimming may therefore eventually lead to active extraction of folding incompetent glycoproteins from the folding attempts phase in the Cnx cycle (10Trombetta E.S.

These findings are all in keeping with a mannose-timer model first proposed by Helenius (20Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and refined in the last decade to include the kifunensine-sensitive ER α-mannosidase I as an essential factor determining the fate of glycoproteins with defective folding (1Ellgaard L.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Depletion of the proximal ER stress sensor IRE1α abolished ER stress-induced EDEM up-regulation and prevented ERAD of a model glycoprotein (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of EDEM and inhibition of its up-regulation in cells exposed to small interfering RNA targeting EDEM transcripts also affected ERAD (16Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P.

Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), no link has yet been established between ERAD capacity and maintenance of functional protein folding environment in the mammalian ER. Based on the severe glycoprotein ERAD (GERAD) phenotype characterizing cells depleted of IRE1α (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), we also expected a block of degradation of terminally misfolded glycopolypeptides in cells depleted of the IRE1α-activated transcription factor Xbp1 that are also unable to adjust the level of EDEM in response to ER stress (24Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Therefore we made use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from Xbp1 knock-out mice generated in the laboratory of Laurie Glimcher and co-workers (25Reimold A.M. Etkin A. Clauss I. Perkins A. Friend D.S. Zhang J. Horton H.F. Scott A. Orkin S.H. Byrne M.C. Grusby M.J. Glimcher L.H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 152-157PubMed Google Scholar) to assess the importance of GERAD activity for maintenance of functional folding environment in the ER lumen. Comparison of GERAD in wt cells and in cells depleted of Xbp1 showed that the Ire1/Xbp1-regulated adaptation of the intralumenal level of EDEM is actually not essential for GERAD but is required for progression to its highest efficiency. Assessment of capacity of wt cells and of cells depleted of Xbp1 to productively assist maturation of model viral glycoproteins expressed upon infection with influenza virus or Semliki forest virus did not reveal differences. Consistently, when wt cells and cells lacking Xbp1 were converted into factories for production of human β-secretase, folding and secretion occurred initially with the same efficiency. Failure to efficiently accomplish GERAD led to a slow accumulation of by-products of β-secretase biosynthesis in the ER lumen of Xbp1-depleted cells as disulfide-bonded, detergent-insoluble aggregates and progressively compromised function of the ER folding machinery. Up-regulation of EDEM but not up-regulation of Cnx prevented deposition of β-secretase in disulfide-bonded aggregates, thus restoring folding efficiency and sustaining secretion capacity at levels comparable with those of wt cells. These findings underscore the crucial role of GERAD and in particular of the regulation of the intralumenal level and activity of EDEM in coupling disposal of misfolded by-products of protein biosynthesis to maintenance of a functional protein folding environment in the ER. Infections and Transfections—Cells were infected as described in (26Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) or transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were starved for 30 min in Met/Cys free medium, pulsed for 10 min with 150 μCi of 35S-labeled Met/Cys in a 1-ml starvation medium/dish, and chased for the times indicated in the figures with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm cold Met/Cys. Postnuclear supernatants were prepared by solubilization of cells in 800 μl/dish ice-cold 2% CHAPS in Hepes buffer saline, pH 6.8, containing 20 mm ice-cold N-ethylmaleimide, protease inhibitors (HBS). Cell extracts were prepared by 10 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were performed by adding protein A beads ((Sigma), 1:10 (w/v) swollen in HBS) and the selected antibody to the cell extracts. Incubations were 1–4 h in a cold room. The immunoprecipitates were extensively washed three times with HBS, 0.5% CHAPS and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Relevant bands were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were also exposed to BioMax (Eastman Kodak Co.) films and scanned with an Agfa scanner. Analysis of the Detergent-insoluble Protein Aggregates—To determine the presence of BACE in CHAPS-insoluble pellet, the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, boiled in 100 μl of 1% SDS in HBS to denature the precipitate, and supplemented with 1 ml of Triton X-100 (1% in HBS) before the addition of protein A beads and antibody to a linear epitope of BACE. At least three independent experiments were analyzed. For Endo H (Roche Applied Science) treatment, BACE501 was immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts before incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 milliunit of Endo H. Xbp1 Depletion Delays Degradation from the ER of Foldingincompetent Glycopolypeptides—Generation of active Xbp1 occurs by unconventional mRNA splicing operated by the ER stress sensor IRE1 in response to intralumenal accumulation of misfolded proteins (27Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar, 28Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 452-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Aware of the block in glycoprotein ERAD in IRE1α-depleted cells (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), we determined the severity of the GERAD phenotype in cells lacking Xbp1. To this end, we compared the degradation of BACE457Δ, a folding-incompetent glycoprotein previously used as a GERAD model substrate (16Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 19Molinari M. Galli C. Piccaluga V. Pieren M. Paganetti P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), in wt and Xbp1–/–MEF. Seventeen h after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and cysteine. After various chase times, cells were detergent-solubilized and postnuclear supernatants were supplemented with a specific antibody to isolate labeled BACE and compare kinetics of degradation in the two cell lines (Fig. 1A). In wt cells, the half-life of BACE457Δ was 45 min (Fig. 1A, wt and average of three independent experiments). In cells lacking Xbp1 degradation was significantly delayed (Fig. 1A, Xbp–/–, the half-life of the protein was 105 min as determined with experiments with longer chase times), but it was not blocked as one could have expected based on the phenotype described for the cells lacking IRE1α (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The GERAD defect was partially corrected and degradation of BACE457Δ in the Xbp1–/–MEF was substantially accelerated with a reduction of the protein half-life to 60 min upon back-transfection with an Xbp1-expression vector (Fig. 1A) or with an EDEM-expression vector (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of Cnx did not accelerate nor delay BACE457Δ degradation in cells lacking Xbp1, showing that variations in the intralumenal level of Cnx were not affecting the capacity of these cells to operate GERAD (Fig. 1C). Exposure of Xbp1-depleted cells to castanospermine, a glucose analogue that prevents the entry of glycoproteins in the Cnx cycle (29Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), restored efficient removal of terminally misfolded glycoproteins from the ER lumen (Fig. 1D). Bypass of the Cnx cycle has been shown to emancipate glycoprotein degradation from the intralumenal level of EDEM (16Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) because EDEM operates as an extraction factor for terminally misfolded glycoproteins from the Cnx cycle (15Oda Y. Hosokawa N. Wada I. Nagata K. Science. 2003; 299: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 16Molinari M. Calanca V. Galli C. Lucca P. Paganetti P. Science. 2003; 299: 1397-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data therefore confirm that the GERAD phenotype of Xbp1–/–MEF is indeed mainly related to the suboptimal level of EDEM. Thus, lack of EDEM up-regulation in cells depleted of Xbp1 delayed degradation of terminally misfolded glycoproteins. In contrast to what was shown previously for cells in which aberrant EDEM up-regulation was caused by depletion of the ER stress sensor IRE1α (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), our data imply that an Xbp1-mediated increase of EDEM caused by a boost of glycoproteins with defective folding in the ER lumen is not essential for degradation of misfolded glycoproteins but is required for ERAD to progress with highest efficiency. Folding of Viral and Cellular Glycoproteins Is Not Affected in Xbp1-Depleted Cells—Next we examined to what extent depletion of Xbp1 interfered with maturation of folding-competent glycoproteins. To this end cells were infected with Semliki Forest virus (SFV) to monitor maturation of the E1 and p62 viral glycoproteins. A single polypeptide chain is expressed in the ER lumen of cells infected with SFV. After a co-translational cleavage generating two glycoproteins (E1 and p62), E1 initiates the folding process in association with BiP and PDI and completes maturation after joining p62 in association with Cnx, Crt, and ERp57 (26Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Release from the ER occurs after oligomerization in trimers of E1/p62 heterodimers. Kinetics of SFV glycoproteins maturation in wt and Xbp1–/–MEF was determined by measuring the association of E1 and p62 with the lectin chaperones Cnx and Crt and by monitoring the generation of E2, a cleavage product of p62 generated in the Golgi after completion of the folding phase. Analysis of E1 and p62 confirmed that Xbp1 depletion did not affect significantly the maturation process because the oxidative phase of folding (Fig. 2A) and kinetics of release from Cnx and Crt (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively), and release from the ER as shown by the generation of E2 (Fig. 2A) occurred at similar rates in wt and Xbp1–/–MEF. The objection could be raised that viral glycoproteins have evolved to optimize folding efficiency under condition of ER overload with viral products, thus minimizing the use of cellular chaperones. Therefore we decided to convert wt and Xbp1–/–MEF in factories producing a cellular glycoprotein, the active variant of human β-secretase (BACE501). BACE501 processes the amyloid precursor protein originating the β-amyloid, an aggregation-prone peptide deposited in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients (30Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). The aim of our experiments was to verify the capacity of wt MEF and of MEF with defective ERAD as a consequence of Xbp1 depletion to sustain production of a secretory protein of interest. The recombinant glycoprotein was expressed in transfected cells and metabolically labeled as described above. Native BACE501 is released from the ER and is subjected to complex glycosylation in the Golgi that decreases electrophoretic mobility (31Huse J.T. Pijak D.S. Leslie G.J. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33729-33737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Both the molecular weight increase (Fig. 2D, arrows. ER for the immature, and G for the mature, complex glycosylated forms of BACE501) and the acquisition of Endo H resistance as a further estimate of the rate of BACE501 export from the ER (Fig. 2E) occurred with similar kinetics in wt and Xbp1–/–MEF when analyzed 17 h after transient transfection. Thus, normal maturation of the viral glycoproteins E1 and p62 (and influenza virus hemagglutinin, not shown) and of the cellular glycoprotein BACE501 showed that cells depleted of Xbp1 were fully competent to assist glycoprotein folding and secretion. Loss of Protein Folding Efficiency and Secretory Capacity in Cells Depleted of Xbp1—To summarize, under normal conditions wt MEF and cells lacking Xbp1 have similar growth rates and viability. Upon viral infection or transient transfection, both cell lines proved at first sight fully competent in assisting efficient maturation and secretion from the ER of the increased amount of client protein entering the ER lumen. Aware that protein folding is error-prone and that increased production of secretory protein must correlate with higher generation of aberrant by-products of protein biosynthesis that need to be rapidly cleared from the ER lumen to avoid constipation, we wondered if cells depleted of Xbp1 and characterized by moderate defect in ERAD were able to maintain high output of secretory proteins. To assess this, we tested and compared maintenance of folding efficiency and transport along the secretory line of BACE501 expressed in transiently transfected wt and Xbp1–/–MEF. Folding efficiency was assessed by determining the presence of terminally misfolded labeled BACE501 in the detergent-insoluble fraction upon CHAPS lysis of cultured cells. Transport along the secretory line was assessed by quantification of the Golgi versus ER form of BACE501 as determined 5 h after synthesis of the recombinant protein. These tests were performed in cells expressing the recombinant protein for 17 (Fig. 3, A and B) or 72 h (Fig. 3, C–H). Briefly, cells were metabolically labeled 17 or 72 h after transfection with a BACE501 expression plasmid as described above, chased for 5 h, and detergent-solubilized. The postnuclear supernatant was supplemented with BACE-specific antibody and analyzed in reducing SDS-PAGE. The detergent-insoluble material was analyzed as described under “Materials and Methods” to determine whether it contained terminally misfolded BACE501. Seventeen h after transfection, the labeled BACE501 analyzed 5 h after the pulse was mostly in the Endo H-resistant, Golgi form (Fig. 2, D and E, and Fig. 3A). The ratio of the Golgi form versus ER form was about 4:1 in both cell lines (Fig. 3A and densitometric quantification of the labeled bands). Analysis of the detergent-insoluble pellet revealed that a small fraction of the labeled BACE501 was misfolding in both cells lines and entered in disulfide-bonded complexes shown at the top of the nonreducing gel (BA for BACE aggregates, Fig. 3B, nonreducing). These aggregates were only slightly more abundant in Xbp1–/–MEF than in wt cells. In reducing gels, the labeled disulfide-bonded complexes were disassembled and the protein originally contained in the aggregates migrated as monomeric BACE501 (BM for BACE monomers in Fig. 3B) confirming that BACE501 was the main labeled component of the complexes. Thus, wt and Xbp1-depleted cells ensured initially similar folding efficiency leading to similar rates of transport of BACE501 along the secretory line. Seventy-two h after transfection, analysis of the fate of the labeled BACE501 after a 5-h chase showed striking differences between the protein expressed in wt and in Xbp1-depleted cells. In wt MEF, BACE501 was transported along the secretory pathway with rate and efficiency similar to those observed 17 h after transfection. In fact, similar to the situation shown in Fig. 3A, more than 80% of the labeled BACE501 had passed ER quality control and was in the complex glycosylated Golgi form after a 5-h chase (Fig. 3C, wt and quantification of the ratio Golgi versus ER form). Also 72 h after transfection most of the labeled BACE501 was detergent-soluble in wt cells, and very little protein was trapped in detergent-insoluble disulfide-bonded complexes (Fig. 3D, wt). Thus, wt cells maintained for 72 h the same efficiency of folding and transport along the secretory line that characterized these cells when analyzed 17 h after transfection. In Xbp1–/–MEF, the ratio of Golgi versus the ER form of BACE501 after a 5-h chase dropped from 4:1 (17 h after transfection, Fig. 3A) to less than 1:1 (72 h after transfection, Fig. 3C). Moreover, the fraction of misfolded and disulfide-bonded BACE501 in the detergent-insoluble pellet was substantially increased compared with wt cells 17 and 72 h after transfection and to the Xbp1-depleted cells analyzed 17 h after transfection (Fig. 3D, Xbp–/–). Thus, cells lacking Xbp1 were initially as effective as wt cells in folding and exporting high amount of secretory glycoprotein recombinantly expressed. However, depletion of Xbp1 resulted in a progressive loss of BACE501 folding efficiency shown by intracellular retention of immature BACE (Fig. 3C, Xbp–/–) and steady increase and long lasting deposition of misfolded BACE501 in disulfide-bonded complexes (Fig. 3D, Xbp–/–). Differential Effects of Increase of EDEM and Cnx on Maintenance of Folding Efficiency—We postulated that defective GERAD in Xbp1–/–MEF (Fig. 1) caused progressive accumulation of by-products of BACE501 expression that eventually affected the capacity of the ER folding machinery to efficiently assist protein folding. EDEM up-regulation increased the capacity of Xbp1–/–MEF to clear the ER lumen from foldingincompetent polypeptides (Fig. 1B), and therefore we wondered if elevation of the intralumenal level of EDEM could help these cells in maintaining folding efficiency and secretory capacity by facilitating clearance of the ER lumen from by-products of BACE501 biosynthesis. Xbp1–/–MEF were co-transfected with a BACE501 and an EDEM expression vector. Their capacity to productively assist BACE501 was assessed 72 h later as described above; cells were therefore metabolically labeled and chased for 5 h to determine the fraction of labeled BACE501 transported along the secretory pathway by quantifying the ratio of the Golgi versus the ER form of BACE501. Comparison with mock-transfected Xbp1–/–MEF showed that whereas in these cells the ratio of the Golgi versus the ER form of BACE501 5 h after synthesis was less than 1:1, cells with an elevated level of EDEM had maintained a ratio of about 4:1 (Fig. 3E, mock versus EDEM), thus very close to the optimal ratio of BACE501 maturation found in wt cells (Fig. 3, A and C) and in Xbp1-depleted cells analyzed 17 h after transfection (Fig. 3A). That folding efficiency and therefore export from the ER was better preserved during the 72 h in cells overexpressing EDEM was confirmed by the lower amount of labeled BACE501 entering in disulfide-bonded aggregates during the 5 h of chase in these cells (Fig. 3F, compare BA and BM in mock and in EDEM-transfected cells). Thus artificial increase of the ERAD activity in Xbp1-depleted cells was sufficient to maintain their capacity to efficiently fold and secrete BACE501 for 72 h. Next we determined whether the same results could have been obtained by strengthening the activity of the ER folding machinery upon Cnx up-regulation. Transfection of Xbp1–/–MEF with a Cnx expression vector, a treatment that had no beneficial effect for ERAD capacity of these cells (Fig. 1C), did also not affect the ratio of the Golgi versus the ER form (Fig. 3G) and did not help in preventing loss of folding efficiency because the same amount of labeled BACE501 entered in disulfide-bonded complexes in mock- and in Cnx-transfected Xbp1-depleted MEF (Fig. 3H). Thus, elevation of the intralumenal level of EDEM (but not of Cnx) granted preservation of folding efficiency and secretory capacity in cells lacking the transcription factor Xbp1. Altogether, in MEF converted into factories producing high amount of a secretory glycoprotein, depletion of Xbp1 did not affect folding and transport of the recombinant protein (or of model viral glycoproteins) initially (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, A and B). However, the fraction of protein fulfilling quality control standards needed for ER exit was strongly reduced in the long run (Fig. 3, C–H) because the activity of the ERAD machinery could not be adjusted to the increased amount of client protein, and the ER lumen thus failed to be cleared from the by-products of glycoprotein biosynthesis. This led to their intracellular accumulation and deposition in detergent-insoluble disulfide-bonded complexes. EDEM was found to play a crucial role in preventing these pathologic events, and its overexpression was sufficient to maintain folding efficiency and sustain production of high levels of recombinant secretory proteins in cells depleted of Xbp1 (Fig. 3, E and F). Here, by taking advantage of a cell line with a defective capacity to adapt the ERAD machinery to the cellular need as a consequence of Xbp1-depletion, we investigated mechanistic and functional links between degradation machinery and protein production facility. We report that an Xbp1-regulated program responds to increase in ER cargo load leading to accumulation of by-products of protein synthesis. Activation of this program preserves efficiency of protein folding in the ER, sustains protein secretion, and prevents formation of intracellular deposits that could eventually compromise cell and/or organism viability. Elevation of the level of the α-mannosidase-like protein EDEM in cells depleted of Xbp1 was necessary to restore the highest efficiency of GERAD, to prevent intralumenal accumulation of misfolded BACE501, and to maintain efficiency of protein folding and secretion at levels comparable with those of wt cells. Until recently, the unfolded protein response (UPR, Refs. 32Rutkowski D.T. Kaufman R.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) was mainly associated with (and studied under) pathological conditions. Cumulating evidences now show that ER stress transducers may also be selectively and/or sequentially activated during physiologic processes such as organogenesis or generation of professional secretors such as plasma cells (35Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 310-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Particularly significant are the works showing a link between expression and activity of the IRE1-activated transcription factor Xbp1 and survival and/or differentiation of secretory cells and organs (25Reimold A.M.

Friend D. Grusby M.J. Alt F. Glimcher L.H. Nature. 2001; 412: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Together with the finding that depletion of IRE1 abolishes the capacity of cells to degrade misfolded glycoproteins accumulating in the ER lumen as a consequence of lack of Xbp1-induced adaptation of the intralumenal level of EDEM (23Yoshida H. Matsui T. Hosokawa N. Kaufman R.J. Nagata K. Mori K. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), these findings moved the spotlight back to the IRE1/Xbp1 UPR pathway, until then considered as “accessory” to the work of other players during mammalian UPR (39Hampton R.Y. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 144-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The current models describing UPR and UPR-like events occurring in mammalian cells are still more focused on the involvement of these processes in preparation and adaptation of the folding/secretion machinery to the increased demand of folding assistance upon rise of ER client proteins, as an example during B cell differentiation in antibody-producing plasma cells (40van Anken E. Romijn E.P. Maggioni C. Mezghrani A. Sitia R. Braakman I. Heck A.J. Immunity. 2003; 18: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 41Gass J.N. Gunn K.E. Sriburi R. Brewer J.W. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Seemingly, studies on the importance of adaptation of the ERAD machinery to maintain efficiency of protein folding and quality control in the mammalian ER and to sustain protein secretion have been neglected so far. It is of great interest that when the activity of the ERAD machinery was artificially elevated by increasing the intralumenal level of ER α-mannosidase I, protein folding-intermediates were prematurely targeted for degradation before completion of chaperone-assisted maturation (17Wu Y. Swulius M.T. Moremen K.W. Sifers R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This suggests that folding and ERAD machineries are to some extent competing for newly synthesized polypeptides. If hyperactivity of the ERAD machinery causes premature termination of chaperone-assisted folding attempts, an insufficient ERAD capacity leads to luminal accumulation of by-products of protein biosynthesis normally generated in the ER lumen because of the inefficiency of the protein folding process. We assume that the mechanisms described in this work are of crucial importance for cells with potent secretory activity because the amount of by-products of protein biosynthesis that needs to be efficiently cleared from the ER lumen is likely to be proportional to the ER load in client proteins. It is of interest that Xbp1, and we believe that the same will be found true for EDEM, is expressed at high level in all secretory organs and cells and that Xbp1 depletion specifically affects generation and survival of secretory cells like hepatocytes and antibody-secreting plasma cells (25Reimold A.M.

For plasma cells, Xbp1 has been shown to intervene in terminal steps of B cell differentiation and to peak in activity well after ER expansion only when Ig synthesis has been boosted (35Ma Y.

Immunity. 2003; 18: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We found that the Xbp1 activation occurring late during the process of plasma cells maturation correlated with up-regulation of EDEM, thus with the reinforcement of the degradation machinery of the plasma cells. 2K. K. Eriksson and M. Molinari, unpublished data. This hints at a cellular response to the increased demand for efficient disposal of by-products of Ig production at a stage in which the secretory factory of plasma cells is busy producing several thousands of Ig molecules per second (42de StGroth S.F. Scheidegger D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 35: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The finding that increasing the ERAD capacity by elevating the intracellular level of EDEM not only enhanced protein degradation from the ER but also prevented accumulation of misfolded and insoluble protein aggregates is important because of the many human diseases caused by protein deposition (43Kopito R.R. Ron D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E207-E209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The adaptation mechanisms described in this paper are proposed to be relevant for survival and unperturbed activity of professional secretors, of cells devoted to expression of particularly problematic proteins (e.g. the cystic fibrosis channel that folds at very low efficiency normally (44Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar)), and even more crucial for cells expressing mutated gene products with defective folding and for cell converted into factories producing recombinant secretory proteins of medical or industrial relevance.

NO production is governed by the activity of three NO synthase (NOS) isoforms. Both neuronal and endothelial NOS are generally expressed under basal conditions in selected cells and are typically calcium- and calmodulin-dependent. Inducible NOS (iNOS) is quiescent in most tissues until it is transcriptionally activated by immune stimuli to produce large amounts of NO (1Kone B.C. Baylis C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F561-F578PubMed Google Scholar). The sustained flux of large amounts of NO produced by iNOS can result in cytotoxicity to both the host and the target cell. Accordingly, both positive and negative modulators have evolved to control tightly iNOS expression and to prevent untoward effects of excessive NO production. Although much is known about the activation of iNOS transcription by cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide, relatively little is known about how iNOS transcription might be constrained.Glomerular mesangial cells contribute to the regulation of glomerular filtration, phagocytosis of immune complexes, and the production of extracellular matrix.

A family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) that can catalyze cytosine methylation in different sequence contexts has been identified. Two methyltransferases, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, have been identified in mouse and humans and are essential for de novo methylation of DNA (15Xie S. Wang Z. Okano M. Nogami M. Li Y. He W.W. Okumura K. Li E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 236: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 16Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4408) Google Scholar). DNMT3b is expressed in adult kidney as well as heart, skeletal muscle, thymus, liver, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (17Robertson K.D. Uzvolgyi E. Liang G. Talmadge C. Sumegi J. Gonzales F.A. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the effects of hyper- and hypomethylation on the cytokine activation of the murine iNOS promoter in glomerular mesangial cells. We found that DNMT3b-dependent methylation of murine iNOS promoter sequences framing a functional enhancer element to which NFκB p50 binds limits iNOS transcriptional activity in response to IL-1β.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Mouse mesangial cells (CRL-1927, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium plus Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% fetal bovine serum. RAW 264.7 macrophage cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Vehicle, IL-1β (10 ng/ml), or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR; 0.2 and 0.5 μg/ml) was added to the cells as indicated in the text and figure legends. Cell number and doubling time in complete medium were quantified by hemocytometric counting of trypsinized cells after trypan blue dye exclusion. Mouse recombinant IL-1β and interferon-γ were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA), respectively. Oligonucleotides were custom synthesized by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent was from Invitrogen. The Dual-Luciferase™ Reporter Assay System and the luciferase vectors pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV40 were from Promega. The BCA protein estimation kit was from Pierce.Plasmids, Stable Transfections, and Reporter Gene Assays—piNOS-luc, which contains the murine iNOS promoter/enhancer and a portion of exon 1 (nucleotides -1486 to +145) in pGL3-Basic, has been previously characterized (18Gupta A.K. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). piNOS-luc/Zeo was constructed by excising the 1.6-kb murine iNOS/promoter together with the firefly luciferase coding region from piNOS-luc and cloning it into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pCDNA3.1-Zeo(+) (Clontech). The authenticity of the DNA insert was confirmed by sequence analysis. For stable transfections, murine mesangial cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with pcDNA3.1-iNOS-luc/Zeo using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were split, and 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) was added for selection. Surviving clonal cell lines were expanded and tested for cytokine-stimulated firefly luciferase activity, which was measured by methods described previously in our laboratory (18Gupta A.K. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple positive cell lines were expanded for subsequent experiments. Deletion constructs containing nucleotides -929 to +145 of the murine iNOS promoter or the region -863 to +145, which lacks the -879/-871 interferon-γ activation sequence (GAS) element, were generated in pGL3-Basic. pRSV-p50, which encodes NFκB p50, was kindly provided by Dr. Warren S.-L. Liao, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The NFκB reporter construct p36B(-)(NFκB)3-luc, which contains three tandem copies of the κB binding element (GGGGACTCTCCC) upstream of the prolactin promoter sequence and fused to the coding sequence for the luciferase gene, was a gift from Dr. Bharrat Agarwal, The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.Antisense Experiments—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides to target nucleotides +70 to +90 of DNMT3b (DNMT3b sense primer 5′-AATGGGAACTTCAGTGACCAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-CTGGTCACTGAAGTTCCCATT-3′) were transfected into murine mesangial cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated in the presence of sense or antisense oligonucleotides for 24 h before they were processed for further analysis.Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total cellular RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described in the manufacturer's manual, and cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega). Amplification of cDNAs was as follows: DNMT3b nucleotides +25 to +375 (sense primer 5′-AATGAAGAAGAGGGTGCCAGCG-3′, antisense primer 5′-ATTGCTATGTCGGGTTCGGAC-3′), GAPDH nucleotides +238 to +757 (sense primer 5′-CCACTAACATCAAATGGGGTGAGG-3′, antisense primer 5′-TACTTGGCAGGTTTCTCCAGGC-3′). Amplification conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and a final extension step for 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gels and imaged with a Kodak ImageStation 1000 (Packard).Nitrite Assays—Mesangial cells, wild type or transfected, were seeded in 24-well plates and stimulated with IL-1β for 24 h. The medium was then collected, and the nitrite concentration was determined with the Griess Reagent System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Western Blotting—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from mouse mesangial cells were prepared using the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation Kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's manual. Twenty-μg samples of nuclear, cytoplasmic, or whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were probed with an anti-iNOS antibody (0.2 μg/ml) or an anti-α-tubulin antibody (0.2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The blots were washed extensively with a solution containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by the ECL protocol using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody.Sodium Bisulfite Modification and Genomic Sequencing—Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse mesangial cells or RAW 264.7 cells that had been treated without or with 5-Aza-CdR for 24 h using the DNA-easy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of DNA was denatured in 50 μlof0.3 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C. For the chemical modification of DNA, 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Sigma) and 30 μl of 10 mm hydroquinone (Sigma) were added to the DNA solution and the samples were mixed, overlaid with mineral oil, and incubated at 50 °C overnight. Modified DNA was purified with the Wizard DNA Clean-up system (Promega) and eluted in water. As a final step, NaOH was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. DNA was precipitated by ethanol and resuspended in water. The sequence of interest in the bisulfite-reacted DNA was PCR-amplified in a reaction mixture containing dNTPs, PCR buffer, and Taq enzyme, and primers listed in Table I. DNA fragments were gel-purified with the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) cloned into pCR4-TOPO10 vector (Invitrogen). Clones with appropriate sized inserts were sequenced.Table IPrimers for sodium bisulfite-PCRDesignationSequence 5′-3′Nucleotide positionsF1TAGTTTTTGTTTTTTAGGTTATTTAG-1485 to -1460R1TAAAATAAAAAATTTACACACACACAC-1230 to -1256F2GTGTGTGTGTGTAAATTTTTTATTTTA-1256 to -1230R2AAATCCACTCATCTTCACATAATCCCC-990 to -1015F3GGGGATTATGTGAAGATGAGTGGATTT-1015 to -990R3CTAATCTACAAAATAAATTCTAAAATAA-768 to -795F4TTATTTTAGAATTTATTTTGTAGATTAG-795 to -768R4CTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTATATATATAT-585 to -610F5ATATATATATAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAG-610 to -585R5CTATTCTCTCAATAAAATTAAATAAT-347 to -372F6ATTATTTAATTTTATTGAGAGAATAG-372 to -347R6TCATAATAAACACTCCTAATCTATAT-111 to -136F7ATATAGATTAGGAGTGTTTATTATGA-136 to -111R7ACAAAACCCAAACATAAAAAACCTCA+113 to +138 Open table in a new tab In Vitro DNA Methylation and Transient Transfection—The methylated plasmids (Met-piNOS-luc and Met-pBL3-Basic) were generated by incubating 40 μg of plasmid DNA with 100 units SssI methylase in reaction buffer consisting of 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9, and 160 μmS-adenosylmethionine according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Inc.). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C overnight. Complete methylation was verified by digestion with the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII. Only plasmids that showed a complete protection from HpaII digestion were used in the transfection experiments. The methylated plasmid DNA was purified by the Wizard DNA Clean-up system (Promega) and transfected into mouse mesangial cells in parallel with the unmethylated piNOS-luc and with pRL-sv40. Luciferase activity was analyzed at 24 h after transfection.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and Supershift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared, quantified, and used for EMSA with double strand probes or competitors as described previously (18Gupta A.K. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). The methylated -885/-866 oligonucleotide was prepared by incubating 20 μg of unmethylated -885/-866 oligonucleotide (5′-AATGCTTTATTGGAAGCATT-3′) with 80 units of SssI CpG methylase at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was then heated at 65 °C to inactivate the methylase, purified by PAGE, and concentrated with Centricon 3 microconcentrators. Nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min on ice in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides followed by the addition of the end-labeled probe and 15 min incubation on ice. Supershift reactions were performed by incubating antibodies against STAT1, STAT3, NFκB p50, NFκB p65, and AP-2 isoforms (2 μg) or IgG as a negative control as described.DNA Methyltransferase Activity Assay—DNA methyltransferase activity was determined in protein extracts by using the assay developed by Adams et al. (19Adams R.L. Rinaldi A. Seivwright C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1991; 22: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% sodium azide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 80, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 30 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation, protein extracts were prepared. Fifteen μl (15–25 μg protein) of lysate was incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 5 μCi of S-[methyl-3H]adenosylmethionine (TRK581, 1Ci = 37GBq, Amersham Biosciences) to a final volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated with 40 μl of stop solution (1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 5% butanol, 125 mm NaCl, 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 4% 4-aminosalicylic acid). The reaction product was purified on spin columns (Amersham Biosciences), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 30 μlof0.3 m NaOH. The solution was spotted on a GF/C filter (Whatman), washed with 3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid and 3 ml of 70% ethanol, dried at 80 °C, and evaluated in a scintillation counter. Parallel reactions were carried out without DNA and were subtracted from the experimental values. Results are expressed as cpm/μg protein.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed using chromatin from vehicle- or IL-1β-treated mesangial cells. Chromatin was fixed and immunoprecipitated using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed in SDS lysis buffer. Nuclei were sonicated for a total of 40 s to shear DNA, the lysates were pelleted, and the supernatants were diluted. The average size of the sonicated DNA fragments subjected to immunoprecipitation was ∼500 bp as determined by ethidium bromide gel electrophoresis. Diluted lysates were pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose 50% slurry for 2 h at 4 °C prior to immunoprecipitation with specified antibodies or rabbit nonimmune IgG at 4 °C overnight. After pelleting, protein A precipitates were washed 5 min each at 4 °C sequentially with low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and finally TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). The antigen/antibody complexes were extracted two times in 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). 20 μl of 5 m NaCl solution was added to the combined eluates. The samples were treated with 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 20 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 1 μl of 20 μg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. The recovered DNA was purified with a DNA Clean-up kit (Qiagen), and samples of input DNA were also prepared in the same way. The presence of the selected DNA sequence was assessed by PCR using primers framing the murine iNOS promoter region of interest: 5′-TGCTAGGGGGATTTTCCCTCTCTC-3′ (nucleotides -978 to -955) and 5′-ACCCTGTTCTGAGAAACAAA-3′ (nucleotides -837 to -818). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; final extension was conducted at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR for the input was performed with genomic DNA. The input fraction corresponded to 1% of the chromatin solution before immunoprecipitation. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel.Data Analysis—Quantitative data are presented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed by analysis of variance. Significance was assigned at p < 0.05.RESULTSDNA Methylation Inhibitors Augment IL-1β Induction of Endogenous NO Production, iNOS Protein, and iNOS Promoter Activity—To determine whether the state of DNA methylation contributes to the regulation of iNOS-generated NO production in mesangial cells, IL-1β-stimulated nitrite production and iNOS protein abundance were measured in the presence of vehicle or 5-Aza-CdR, a potent and specific inhibitor of DNA methylation. iNOS is the only NOS isoform appreciably expressed in these cell types and induced by these stimuli (20Kuncewicz T. Balakrishnan P. Snuggs M.B. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F326-F336PubMed Google Scholar). Mesangial cells that had been treated with 5-Aza-CdR and stimulated with IL-1β exhibited ∼150% greater nitrite levels compared with IL-1β-stimulated controls (Fig. 1A). Similarly, mesangial cells that had been treated with 5-Aza-CdR exhibited higher levels of IL-1β-stimulated protein expression compared with vehicle and IL-1β-treated controls (Fig. 1B). Cell counting experiments indicated that under these cell culture conditions, the cells exhibited a sigmoidal growth curve with a mean doubling time of ∼11.5 h before confluence.To determine whether the stimulatory effect of 5-Aza-CdR included effects on iNOS transcription, vehicle or 5-Aza-CdR was added to mesangial cell lines that had been stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector containing the murine iNOS promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene. In this context, the iNOS promoter-luciferase is stably integrated into the genome. The transfected cells were then treated with medium or IL-1β, and the induction of iNOS reporter gene activity was measured. As seen in Fig. 1C, mesangial cells treated with IL-1β in the absence of 5-Aza-CdR exhibited the expected induction of iNOS promoter-luciferase activity. In keeping with the nitrite and iNOS protein responses, mesangial cells treated with 5-Aza-CdR exhibited a ∼135% increase in the-fold-induction of iNOS promoter activity in response to IL-1β (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that hypomethylation increases (and hypermethylation decreases) cytokine induction of iNOS promoter activity in mesangial cells. The restoration of iNOS induction by 5-Aza-CdR treatment could be related to a direct demethylation of the iNOS gene or another gene, whose expression is required for iNOS activation.Antisense Knockdown of DNMT3b Activity Augments IL-1β Induction of Endogenous NO Production and iNOS Promoter Activity in Mesangial Cells—To address more specifically the effects of methylation status on iNOS promoter induction, DNMT3b was specifically suppressed by antisense methods in mesangial cells stably expressing iNOS promoter-luc, and the consequences on iNOS promoter-reporter gene activity were measured. As seen in Fig. 2A, antisense oligonucleotides directed against DNMT3b suppressed DNMT3b mRNA expression but not the control gene GAPDH as monitored by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, whereas sense oligonucleotides had no effect. This antisense blockade of DNMT3b corresponded to a ∼70% decrease in DNMTase activity (Fig. 2B), indicating the functional efficacy of the blockade and the fact that DNMT3b is the principal isoform contributing to DNMTase activity in these cells. In agreement with the results of pharmacologic inhibition of methylation (Fig. 1C), antisense knockdown of DNMT3b resulted in enhanced levels of nitrite production (Fig. 2C) and iNOS promoter activity (Fig. 2D) in response to IL-1β compared with similarly treated sense controls. DNMT3b protein has a relatively short half-life (21Leu Y.W. Rahmatpanah F. Shi H. Wei S.H. Liu J.C. Yan P.S. Huang T.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6110-6115PubMed Google Scholar), and the doubling time of the mesangial cells was sufficiently rapid to allow at least one replication cycle to occur after antisense knockdown of DNMT3b.Fig. 2Antisense knockdown of DNMT3b augments induction of the murine iNOS promoter. Mesangial cells stably transfected with piNOS-luc containing the full-length wild type murine iNOS promoter were transfected with antisense or sense oligonucleotides specifically targeting DNMT3b. After transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or IL-1β for 24 h. RNA or cell lysates were then prepared for (A) reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of DNMT3b or GAPDH (as a control) expression, (B) DNA methyltransferase activity, (C) nitrite production, or (D) luciferase activity (n = 5). *, p < 0.05 versus sense controls. *, p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated cells not transfected (none).

In parallel experiments, unmethylated piNOS-luc was transfected as a control. Compared with full stimulation of unmethylated piNOS-luc, methylated piNOS-luc was only marginally stimulated by IL-1β when transiently transfected (Fig. 3).Fig. 3In vitro methylation of induction of the murine iNOS promoter. The iNOS promoter-luciferase plasmid piNOS-luc was methylated in vitro by SssI, an enzyme that methylates cytosines, and then transiently transfected into mouse mesangial cells (Met). In parallel experiments, unmethylated (UM) piNOS-luc was transfected as a control. After transfection, the cells were treated with vehicle or IL-1β for 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity (n = 5). *, p < 0.05 versus cells transfected with unmethylated piNOS-luc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Bisulfite Treatment and Sequencing Analysis Identifies Methylation of the iNOS Promoter—iNOS promoter methylation at cytosine nucleotides was investigated. Sodium bisulfite deaminates unmethylated cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA under conditions in which the 5-methylcytosine remains nonreactive. Thus, all cytosine residues remaining at the time of sequencing represent cytosines that were methylated in the original DNA sequence. The methylated cytosines were distinguished from the unmethylated cytosines within the sequenced fragment because they were resistant to sodium bisulfite treatment and remained unchanged. Genomic DNA from murine mesangial cells in the presence and absence of 5-Aza-CdR and genomic DNA from RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were analyzed. Sequencing analysis showed that cytosines at -881, -869, -648, and -601 were methylated in the iNOS promoter from both cell lines and were demethylated in the presence of 5-Aza-CdR. Cytosines at -196, -652, -654, -656, -828. -830, -845, -919, and -927 of the iNOS promoter were methylated in mesangial cells (and demethylated in the presence of 5-Aza-CdR) but not in RAW 264.7 cells. In contrast RAW 264.7 cells but not mesangial cells were methylated at -644. We placed particular emphasis on the cytosines methylated in both cell lines and noted that the methylated cytosines at -881 and -869 framed a functional enhancer containing a GAS consensus sequence at -879 to -871 (Fig. 4). In our previous work, we showed that mutation of this GAS consensus site in the iNOS promoter resulted in a 65% reduction in maximal IL-1β induction of promoter activity (10Yu Z. Zhang W. Kone B.C. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Sodium bisulfite modification and genomic sequencing of the iNOS promoter reveals cytosine methylation at -881 and -869.

In the present study we examined the N-nitrosotryptophan derivative-dependent nitrosation of thiols, a hitherto ignored possibility for the formation of S-nitrosothiols. The corresponding products were identified by 15N-NMR spectrometry. The fact that the reaction proceeded under hypoxic conditions as well as in non-aqueous solution strongly indicated the occurrence of a transnitrosation reaction. Interestingly, S-nitrosothiols could only very slowly transnitrosate N-terminal-blocked tryptophan derivatives like melatonin in non-aqueous solution but did not induce such a reaction in water. The indole moiety of the N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives was fully restituted during the reaction with thiols, as demonstrated by both capillary zone electrophoresis and fluorescence spectroscopy. A determination of the Arrhenius parameters demonstrated that the corresponding rate constants were comparable with the ones known for the transfer of the nitroso function from nitrosothiol to thiolate. Thus, N-nitrosotryptophan-dependent nitrosation of thiols may occur in vivo and might offer the possibility of developing a new class of vasodilative drugs.

Two nitrosating entities have been established as being responsible for the nitrosation of thiols/thiolates in vitro at physiological pH. The first nitrosating agent is peroxynitrite (authentic material and in situ generated from ·NO/O2−˙−releasing systems), which nitrosates thiols with a yield of 0.06–0.8%, but there is disagreement in the literature about the underlying mechanisms (7Schrammel A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11931-11936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It is supposed that nitrosation of the thiols, as illustrated in Equation 3,RSH+N2O3→RSNO+H++NO2−˙k3=6.4×106M−1S−1(Eq. 3) proceeds by a N2O3-dependent electrophilic substitution reaction (9Keshive M. Singh S. Wishnok J. Tannenbaum S. Deen W. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 988-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Additionally, S-nitrosothiols may be formed, as demonstrated in Equation 4,RS−+N2O3→RSNO+NO2−˙k4=1.8×108M−1S−1(Eq. 4) from the highly effective reaction of thiolate anions with N2O3 (8Goldstein S. Czapski G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3419-3425Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently, as shown in Equation 5,that N-terminal-blocked tryptophan derivatives can be effectively nitrosated at the nitrogen atom of the indole ring by N2O3 at physiological pH (10Kirsch M. Fuchs A. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11931-11936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On account of theoretical considerations, N2O3 should be able to nitrosate tryptophan and cysteine with comparable efficiency. In contradiction to this conclusion, the formation of N-nitrosotryptophan in proteins has not yet been detected by mass spectrometry methods in previous studies. One possible explanation for this failure may be that low molecular weight metabolites such as ascorbic acid denitrosate N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives under the release of ·NO and the restitution of the indole ring. Moreover, N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives, but not S-nitrosothiols, are hydrolyzed to nitrite and tryptophan derivatives, thus rendering the half-life to 140 min (10Kirsch M. Fuchs A. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11931-11936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Meyer T.A. Williams D.L.H. Bonnett R. Ooi S.L. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 1982; : 1383-1387Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study we identified for the first time a further N-nitrosotryptophan-depleting reaction, i.e. the transfer of the nitroso function from N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives to thiols. This putatively important reaction is fully characterized by using UV-visible absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy, capillary zone electrophoresis, and 15N-NMR-spectrometry. Interestingly, such a transnitrosation reaction proceeds in an aqueous solution with an efficacy comparable with that of the transfer of the nitroso function between S-nitrosothiols and thiols. Chemicals—N-Acetyltryptophan, cysteine, glutathione, and N-acetyl-penicillamine (NAP) were obtained from Sigma. Na15NO2 labeled with 99.3% 15N was purchased from Aldrich/Isotec Inc. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Experimental Conditions—Because nitrosation reactions are sensitive to the presence of metal ions, the buffer solutions were exposed to a chelating resin (Chelex 100) as described previously (12Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16702-16708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Synthesis of N-Acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (NANT)—NANT was prepared with a procedure described originally by Bonnett and Holleyhead (13Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; : 962-964Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which was improved by us. In brief, d,l-N-acetyltryptophan (526 mg) and sodium nitrite (162 mg of Na14NO2 or 165 mg of Na15NO2) were stirred in purified water (20 ml) for 2 h in the dark at room temperature. The yellow reaction mixture was cooled to 1 °C, and cold HCl (10 ml, 1 m, 1 °C) was added. A yellow, organic precipitate was formed that was immediately extracted with ethyl acetate (60 ml, 1 °C). The cold organic layer was separated and taken to evaporation at room temperature under reduced pressure (18 torrs) to yield ∼500 mg of d,l-N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan (ϵ335(ethanol) = 6100 m–1 cm–1) (13Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; : 962-964Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentration of NANT was spectrophotometrically analyzed with a SPECORD S 100 spectrophotometer from Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany). Synthesis of GS15NO—Glutathione (3.07 g) and Na15NO2 (0.69 g) were allowed to react in a mixture of purified water (11 ml) and HCl (10 ml) for 40 min at 4 °C. Afterward, 20 ml of acetone were added and stirred again for 10 min. Next, the precipitate was washed with 10 ml of water, 3 × 20 ml of acetone, and 3 × 20 ml of ether, dried in an exsiccator, and stored at –20 °C. The concentration of the prepared GS15NO was quantified by reading the optical density at λmax = 545 nm (ϵ545 = 20 m–1 cm–1) (14Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 2000; : 1639-1644Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 15N-SNAP—NAP (5 g) was dissolved in a mixture of 500 ml of MeOH and 500 ml of HCl and cooled to 0 °C. This mixture was stirred, and a nitrite solution (4.1 g Na15NO2/40 ml H2O) was slowly added dropwise. After being stirred for ∼30 min, the reaction mixture was stored at –18 °C overnight. The next day, the red-green crystals of 15N-SNAP were filtered and dried in vacuo to yield ∼90–95% 15N-SNAP (∼4.5 g). The concentration of 15N-SNAP was spectrophotometrically analyzed at 595 nm in MeOH (ϵ595(MeOH) = 16 m–1 cm–1) (15Szacilowski K. Stasicka Z. Prog. React. Kinet. Mech. 2000; 26: 1-58Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of 10 mm NANT were prepared by mixing 2.76 mg of NANT with 1 ml of phosphate buffer (50 mm HPO42–, pH = 7.4, 25/37 °C). The concentration of the NANT stock solution was quantified by reading the optical density of a diluted aliquot at λMax = 335 nm (ϵ335 = 6100 m–1 cm–1 (13Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; : 962-964Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quantification of NANT and NAT—NANT and NAT were quantified by capillary zone electrophoresis on a Beckman P/ACE 5000 apparatus under the conditions of a fused silica capillary column (50-cm effective length, 75-μm internal diameter), hydrodynamic injection for 5 s, a temperature of 25 °C, voltage of 20 kV, normal polarity, 66 μA, and UV light detection at 280 nm. As an electrolyte solution, a mixture of 10 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, and 25 mm dodecyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide (pH 7.4) was employed. Migration time in capillary zone electrophoresis for NAT and NANT was 14 min (total time 16 min) in phosphate buffer (detection limit of ∼15 μm, pH 7.4). The GSH-induced formation of NAT and the decay of NANT were additionally determined by either exciting the formed NAT (λexc = 270 ± 10 nm/λem = 358 ± 10 nm, detection limit of <1 μm) or reading the optical density at 335 nm (ϵ335(NANT) = 6100 m–1 cm–1) (13Bonnett R. Holleyhead R. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1974; : 962-964Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quantification of GSNO—The formation of GSNO was detected at pH 4.5–7.4 by its characteristic absorbance band at 545 nm (ϵ545 = 20 m–1 cm–1) (14Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. II. 2000; : 1639-1644Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). 15N-NMR Identification of Nitrosated Products—Immediately after nitrosation, sample aliquots were supplemented with 10% D2O and analyzed by 15N-NMR spectrometry. The adducts were identified by 50.67-MHz 15N-NMR spectrometry on a Bruker AVANCE DRX 500 instrument. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts per million relative to neat nitromethane (δ = 0) as the external standard. Statistics—The experiments reported here were carried out independently at least three times on different days. The results are expressed as means ± S.D. Formation of S-Nitrosothiols—To demonstrate the N-nitrosotryptophan-dependent formation of S-nitrosothiols, the lipophilic thiol NAP was mixed with 15N-NANT in Me2SO (Fig. 1, A–C). In this lipophilic environment the resonances of authentic 15N-NANT and preformed 15N-SNAP were found at 170 and 185 ppm (Fig. 1A) as well as at 455 ppm (Fig. 1B). In contrast to the experiments performed in phosphate buffer (see below), only three resonances were observed at 170, 185, and 455 ppm during the reaction of 15N-NANT with NAP (Fig. 1C). That observation can be put down to the fact that NANT and SNAP are stable compounds in dried Me2SO such that their decomposition products, nitrite and nitrate, did not accumulate. Because the formed 15N-SNAP exhibited a sharp and intense resonance line in Me2SO, the NANT-dependent formation of the S-nitrosothiol via a transnitrosation reaction was unequivocally proven. Oae and Shinhama (16Oae S. Shinhama K. Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1983; 15: 165-198Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggested that S-nitrosothiols transnitrosate aromatic amines, but any evidence for such a reaction with an indole ring as the target is missing in the literature. As the 15NO moiety of 15N-NANT was only partly transferred to the thiol group of NAP in Me2SO even after a reaction period of 4 days (Fig. 1C), we checked whether 15N-SNAP can transnitrosate NAT (Fig. 1D). In fact, after 6 days of incubation the characteristic resonances of 15N-NANT at 170 and 185 ppm appeared in the reaction mixture. Similar results were observed when NAT was replaced by melatonin (Fig. 1E). Again, the generation of 15N-nitrosomelatonin was unequivocally demonstrated by the increase of its 15N-NMR resonance lines at 166 and 178 ppm, respectively, after 6 days of incubation. Thus, in a non-aqueous solution the reaction of N-nitrosotryptophan-derivatives with thiols is in equilibrium with the products, as shown in Equation 6,15N−NANT+NAP⇌NAT+15N−SNAP(Eq. 6) although the corresponding rate constants are obviously low. To extend our data to the aqueous solution, the product pattern of the reaction of 15N-NANT (200 mm) with glutathione (150 mm) was analyzed by 15N-NMR-spectrometry. In phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, authentic GS15NO exhibited its 15N-NMR resonance line at ∼390 ppm (Fig. 2A). An inspection of Fig. 2, B and C demonstrated the occurrence of five 15N-NMR resonance lines during the reaction of 15N-NANT with GSH, i.e.15N-nitrate at –5 ppm, 15N-NANT at 167 ppm and 182 ppm, and 15N-nitrite at 229 ppm. The spread and flattened resonance at 390 ppm belonged to the buildup of GS15NO. Because the 15N-NMR resonance line of GS15NO may be affected by the aqueous solution, the formation of GSNO from the reaction of NANT (66 mm) with GSH (33 mm) was studied by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. 3, A and B). In fact, the characteristic UV-visible absorption of GSNO at 545 nm continuously increased during the reaction of NANT and GSH (Fig. 3A), which is in full agreement with the 15N-NMR experiments. Noticeably, the reaction between NANT and the thiol was obviously orders of magnitude faster in water than in dried Me2SO (see below). When equimolar concentrations of NANT and GSH were used, the UV-visible maximum at 545 nm did not increase continuously (Fig. 3B), probably because of a GS–-induced depletion of S-nitrosoglutathione as reported by Singh et al. (17Singh S.P. Wishnok J.S. Keshive M. Deen W.M. Tannenbaum S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Formation of GSNO. The reaction of NANT with GSH was analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 25 °C, 545 nm). A, 66 mm NANT and 33 mm GSH. B, 33 mm NANT and 33 mm GSH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Influence of pH on the Yield of GSNO—As a possible consequence of the GS–-mediated decrease of S-nitrosoglutathione, the yield of GSNO at pH 7.4 leveled off to ∼12% (Table I). Because thiolate anions are expected to attack S-nitrosothiols, the NANT-dependent yield of GSNO should increase at more acidic pH values when the GS–-dependent side reaction cannot proceed effectively. Therefore, the pH was stepwise lowered down to 4.5, and the yields of GSNO were determined (Table I). In fact, decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 4.5 increased the yield of GSNO from ∼12 to ∼45%. Thus, the NANT-derived yield of GSNO at pH 7.4 is indeed affected by the GS–-mediated decrease of the S-nitrosothiol.Table IpH-dependence of the GSNO yieldpHGSNO yield%7.412.5 ± 2.07.012.8 ± 2.06.515.9 ± 4.26.023.3 ± 3.85.036.7 ± 12.54.545.0 ± 3.0 Open table in a new tab Formation of NAT—In addition to GSNO, NAT should be formed during the reaction of NANT with GSH. To check this probability, the NANT/GSH (0.8 mm/5 mm)-dependent formation of NAT was established via capillary zone electrophoresis by spiking with authentic material at pH 7.4 (Fig. 4A, chromatograms a–c). The chromatograms clearly demonstrated the formation of NAT from the reaction of NANT with GSH. In parallel runs, the formed amount of NAT as well as the decreased concentration of NANT was distinguished by the fluorescence capabilities of NAT (λexc = 270 nm/λem = 358 nm) and the characteristic UV-visible absorbance of NANT at 335 nm (Fig. 4B), respectively. Fig. 4B clearly illustrates that the increase of the NAT concentration was strictly connected with the decrease of the NANT concentration during the reaction. For instance, the concentration of NAT increased by ∼0.4 mm during the reaction period, and about the same amount of NANT was denitrosated by GSH. However, we observed a continuous decrease of the total amount of NANT and NAT during the reaction. This tiny decrease is again explained by the GS–-dependent side reaction. Reaction of low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols with thiols has been reported to yield nitroxyl (18P Wong S.-Y. Hyun J. Fukuto J.M. Shirota F.N. deMaster E.G. Shoeman D.W. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5362-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), which generates strong oxidants like peroxynitrite (19Kirsch M. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13379-13388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and tryptophan is a very good target for this peroxide and the radicals derived from it (20Alvarez B. Rubbo H. Kirk M. Barnes S. Freeman B.A. Radi R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J.

Redox Report. 1996; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, the GSH-dependent denitrosation of NANT most likely yielded stoichiometric amounts of NAT, thereby fully restituting the indole ring during this transnitrosation reaction. As expected from a true transnitrosation reaction, NANT was additionally denitrosated by GSH under hypoxic conditions at pH 7.4, but the backward reaction did not proceed because independently performed experiments demonstrated that the decay of GSNO (50 mm) was not altered in the presence of NAT (66 mm) (data not shown). Conclusively, the transfer of the nitroso function, shown in Equation 7,NANT+GSH→NAT+GSNO(Eq. 7) proceeded in aqueous solution only from the N-nitrosotryptophan derivative to the thiol. Reaction Rate Constants—For a discussion of the putative significance of N-blocked, N-nitrosotryptophan-dependent nitrosation of thiols in vivo, the reaction between NANT and GSH was kinetically characterized. We refrained from determining the underlying rate constant k from the increase of the UV-visible absorbance of S-nitrosothiols at ∼545 nm because of the GS–-induced side reaction (see above). Because the absorbance coefficient of NANT (ϵ335 = 6100 m–1 cm–1) is high, low concentrations of NANT (100 μm) and either GSH (100 μm) or cysteine (100 μm) were used for the determination of the rate constants. From the Arrhenius plots of the rate data (Figs. 5, A and B), activation barriers of 17.2/16 kcal and A-factors of 1.9e13/1.6e12 were extracted for GSH and cysteine, respectively (Table II). From the Arrhenius parameter we calculated the corresponding rate constants at 37 °C for the reaction of NANT with either GSH or cysteine and measured the rate constants of the similar reactions between N-nitrosomelatonin and these thiols (Table III). Interestingly, the rate constants of the transnitrosation reactions between N-terminal blocked tryptophan derivatives and thiols attained (more or less) a level that is evident for the transfer of the nitroso function from S-nitrosothiols to thiols.Table IIArrhenius parameters for the reactions between NANT with either GSH or cysteineArrhenius parametersNANT + GSHNANT + cysteineA1.9 ± 0.3E + 131.6 ± 0.3E + 12Ea72 kJ ± 1.7 (17.2 kcal ± 0.4)67 kJ ± 1.7 (16 kcal ± 0.4) Open table in a new tab Table IIIRate constants for the transfer of the nitroso-function from nitroso-compounds to thiolsReactionk1SourceTemperaturem-1 s-1°CNANT + GSH13.1 ± 2.5This paper37NANT + cysteine5.9 ± 0.9This paper37NO-melaaMelatonin. + GSH13.5 ± 5.6This paper37NO-melaaMelatonin. + cysteine7.2 ± 2.4This paper37SNAP + GSH9.09 ± 0.784837SNAP + cysteine20.63 ± 3.154837GSNO + NAP0.53 ± 0.134837CySNO + NAP3.15 ± 1.114837a Melatonin. Open table in a new tab In the present study we identified, as delineated in Equations 8 and 9,NO−melatonin+RSH→melatonin+RSNO(Eq. 9) a hitherto unknown transnitrosation reaction, i.e. the transfer of the nitroso function from N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives to thiols in aqueous and non-aqueous solutions. The finding that, via a transnitrosation reaction, S-nitrosothiols can generate N-acetyl-N-nitrosotryptophan as well as N-nitrosomelatonin in Me2SO, i.e. the backward reactions of Equations 8 and 9, is a second novelty. On the other hand, such a spontaneous backward reaction is very slow in non-aqueous solutions and does not spontaneously proceed in an aqueous solution. This fact may strongly limit its impact under physiological conditions, but because quantum-chemical calculations predict that the thermodynamical equilibrium lies on the side of the N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives, 2M. Kirsch and H. de Groot, unpublished results. the importance of the backward reactions might strongly increase when a yet unidentified enzymatic catalysis is operating in vivo. However, in an aqueous solution the spontaneous forward reaction (Equations 8 and 9) is strongly favored so that the reaction rate constants reach values that are comparable with the ones known for the transfer of the nitroso function from S-nitrosothiols to thiols (Table III). Noticeably, transnitrosation reactions between S-nitrosothiols and thiols are now believed to be involved “in the transport and targeting of NO bioactivity in signal transduction” (23Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) and “in membranes for transfer of NO” (23Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24Gross S.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate constants of the transnitrosation reaction between N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives and thiols are obviously high enough to achieve some importance under physiological conditions. Previous studies have shown, as seen in Equation 10,NANT+H2O/H3O+→NAT+H++NO2−˙(Eq. 10) that the hydrolysis of NANT at 37 °C and pH 7.4 limits its maximal half-life time to ∼140 min (10Kirsch M. Fuchs A. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11931-11936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because an identical half-life time was found for nitrosated tryptophan in human serum albumin (25Harohalli K. Petersen C.E. Ha C.E. Feix J.B. Bhagavan N.V. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 47-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is to be expected that the hydrolysis of other N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives would proceed at a similar speed. From this point of view, the lifetime of N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives seems to be long enough for operating as an intermediate in vivo. The transfer of the nitroso function to thiols must, of course, decrease the lifetime of N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives, and the question arose about physiological N-nitrosotryptophan concentrations in plasma. Because N-nitroso compounds were found in aortic rat tissues (26Rodriguez J. Maloney R.E. Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and proline can be nitrosated only at acidic pH values (27Heyns K. Konigsdorf W. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1952; 290: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lijinsky W. Keefer L. Loo J. Tetrahedron. 1970; 26: 5137-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), one may conclude that N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives represent the major amount of the experimentally identified N-nitroso compounds in vivo. The major amount of N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives would be located in proteins, because the concentrations of low molecular weight, N-terminal blocked tryptophan derivatives like melatonin are very low in plasma (∼0.2 nm) (29Magri F. Sarra S. Cinchetti W. Guazzoni V. Fioravanti M. Cravello L. Ferrari E. J. Pineal Res. 2004; 36: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The main mass thiols circulating in blood are albumin (680 μm) (6Stamler J.S. Simon D.I. Osborne J.A. Mullins M.E. Jaraki O. Michel T. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), cysteine (∼10 μm) (30Aukrust P. Svardal A.M. Muller F. Lunden B. Berge R.K. Froland S.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), homocysteine (5–15 μm) (31Guo H. Lee J.D. Ueda T. Shan J. Wang J. Jpn Heart J. 2003; 44: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and glutathione (7 μm) (30Aukrust P. Svardal A.M. Muller F. Lunden B. Berge R.K. Froland S.S. Blood. 1995; 86: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming that one reaction partner of the transnitrosation reaction should be a low molecular weight molecule and keeping in mind the plasma concentrations of low molecular weight thiols (∼30 μm, see above), one can calculate, using the rate constants outlined in Table III, that the transfer of the nitroso function from N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives to thiols would outcompete the hydrolysis reaction at N-nitrosotryptophan concentrations >25 nm. In other words, the low molecular weight thiols are expected to render the steady-state plasma concentration of N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives to an upper limit of ∼25 nm, which is in full agreement with the experimental value of 33 ± 6 nm for the total amount of N-nitroso compounds in aortic rat tissues (26Rodriguez J. Maloney R.E. Rassaf T. Bryan N.S. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In 1996 Zhang et al. (32Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) studied the biological activity of N-nitrosated Gly-Trp and carboxymethyl bovine serum albumin (CM-BSA), a modified derivative in which the thiol group is covalently blocked, in comparison with GSNO. Because these data were a bit distorted by the nitroso content of the applied nitroso compounds, i.e. 89, 22, and 19% for GSNO, Gly-NO-Trp, and N-nitroso CM-BSA, respectively, we approximated the data of Zhang et al. to a nitroso content of 100% (Table IV). Interestingly, the corrected data clearly demonstrate that the efficacy of the Gly-NO-Trp-induced vasorelaxation and the inhibition of platelet aggregation was nearly identical to that of GSNO. Because Gly-NO-Trp does not spontaneously diffuse through cellular membranes, Zhang et al. (32Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggested that extracellular N-nitrosocompounds transfer the nitroso function via a transnitrosation reaction to a NO-carrier “located on or associated with the plasma membrane” (32Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Assuming that a protein-bound cysteine is the NO carrier, which can indeed be highly effective in transporting nitric oxide through cellular membranes (23Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 24Gross S.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the small peptide Gly-NO-Trp may induce such a process. However, a N-nitroso CM-BSA-dependent transnitrosation reaction of a protein-bound cysteine at the plasma membrane seems to be highly unlikely because of a massive steric hindrance during such a transfer of the nitroso function. Thus, a reason other than a N-nitroso CM-BSA-dependent transnitrosation of the membrane-bound cysteine must be found to explain the observed capabilities (Table IV). It should be noted that the experiments of Zhang et al. (32Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.-M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F. Loscalzo J. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab However, it may be a pharmacological improvement to stimulate the reaction of low molecular weight, N-terminal blocked N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives with the plasma thiols by applying NANT or derivatives of it. The mutagenicity of NANT in bacteria as described by Venitt et al. (33Venitt S. Crofton-Sleigh C. Ooi S.L. Bonnett R. Carcinogenesis. 1980; 1: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) only occurred at concentrations >180 μm, and harmful effects were not observed at typical pharmacological concentrations (∼1–50 μm) (34Mutschler E. Derendorf H. Drug Actions: Basic Principles and Therapeutic Aspects. MedPharm Scientific Publishers, Stuttgart, Germany1995Google Scholar). These findings should not limit the use of NANT or derivatives of it as a pharmacological compound, because a variety of (pro)drugs induce toxicological pathways at higher concentrations, e.g. the drug sodium nitroprusside (35Cottrell J.E. Casthely P. Brodie J.D. Patel K. Klein A. Turndorf H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Providing that NANT is a harmless compound at low plasma concentrations (≤20 μm), there may be several advantages for its use as compared with a suggested application of low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols. For example, exogenous S-nitrosothiols operate as vasodilators in vivo (36Butler A.R. Rhodes P. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), they prevent platelet adhesion as well as aggregation (1Ignarro L.J. Lipton H. Edwards J.C. Baricos W.H. Hyman H.L. Kadowitz P.J.

Vallance P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 154-160PubMed Google Scholar). However, low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols do not react regiospecifically with thiols because, as shown in Equation 11,R1S(H)+R2SNO→R1SSR2+(H)NO(Eq. 11) they generate the harmful (41Ohshima H.

Knowledge about the precise relative rates of these two reactions is very tenuous, but it is clear that a relative slow reaction (Equation 11) is not effectively suppressed when the competition reaction, shown in Equation 12,R1S(H)+R2SNO⇌R1SNO+R2S(H)(Eq. 12) is a reversible one. Thus, although exogenous S-nitrosothiols are vasodilators, their pharmacological activity is presumably a bit hampered by the reaction outlined in Equation 11. This drawback will not be present with the application of NANT, becauseN-nitrosotryptophanderivativesregiospecificallytransnitrosate thiols, thereby generating the harmless compound N-acetyltryptophan and a vasodilatative active S-nitrosothiol (Equation 8). In addition, one may suggest applying NANT as a mainly nitric oxide-releasing drug by co-administrating ascorbate. However, we believe that the suggested application of N-nitrosomelatonin (45Blanchard-Fillion B. Servy C. Ducrocq C. Free Radic. Res. 2001; 35: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) cannot be a pharmacological improvement, because in such a case melatonin would be generated at unphysiological high concentrations, thereby supporting harmful side reactions like abdominal pain and hypotension (46Holliman B.J.

The novel S-nitrosothiol-yielding reaction between N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives and thiols is fully characterized. The transfer of the nitroso function from the N-nitrosotryptophan derivative to the thiol proceeds with rate constants that are very typical for S-nitrosothiol-dependent transnitrosation reactions. The spontaneous formation of S-nitrosothiols from the reaction of thiols with N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives is irreversible in aqueous solution, which would limit the steady-state concentrations of the latter nitroso-compounds in biological systems. However, this irreversible transnitrosation reaction may be of pharmacological interest in order to stimulate the formation of S-nitrosothiols in vivo by applying low molecular weight N-nitrosotryptophan derivatives like NANT."
https://openalex.org/W2132507657,"Geminin is an unstable regulatory protein that affects both cell division and cell differentiation. Geminin inhibits a second round of DNA synthesis during S and G(2) phase by binding the essential replication protein Cdt1. Geminin is also required for entry into mitosis, either by preventing replication abnormalities or by down-regulating the checkpoint kinase Chk1. Geminin overexpression during embryonic development induces ectopic neural tissue, inhibits eye formation, and perturbs the segmental patterning of the embryo. In order to define the structural and functional domains of the geminin protein, we generated over 40 missense and deletion mutations and tested their phenotypes in biological and biochemical assays. We find that geminin self-associates through the coiled-coil domain to form dimers and that dimerization is required for activity. Geminin contains a typical bipartite nuclear localization signal that is also required for its destruction during mitosis. Nondegradable mutants of geminin interfere with DNA replication in succeeding cell cycles. Geminin's Cdt1-binding domain lies immediately adjacent to the dimerization domain and overlaps it. We constructed two nonbinding mutants in this domain and found that they neither inhibited replication nor permitted entry into mitosis, indicating that this domain is necessary for both activities. We identified several missense mutations in geminin's Cdt1 binding domain that were deficient in their ability to inhibit replication yet were still able to allow mitotic entry, suggesting that these are separate functions of geminin."

However, PAF did not provide sufficient signal for CC chemokine receptor ligand 2 (CCL2) production in cells expressing mPAFR. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that receptor phosphorylation provides a G protein-independent signal that synergizes with Ca2+ mobilization to induce CCL2 production. Here, we show that a mutant of PAFR (D289A), which does not couple to G proteins, was resistant to agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we found that when this mutant was coexpressed with mPAFR, it restored NF-κB activation and CCL2 production. PAF caused translocation of β-arrestin from the cytoplasm to the membrane in cells expressing PAFR but not a phosphorylation-deficient mutant in which all Ser/Thr residues were replaced with Ala (ΔST-PAFR). Interestingly, PAF induced significantly higher NF-κB and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-luciferase activity as well as CCL2 production in cells expressing ΔST-PAFR than those expressing PAFR. Furthermore, a Ca2+/calcineurin inhibitor completely inhibited PAF-induced NFAT activation and CCL2 production but not NF-κB activation. These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of PAFR provides a G protein-independent signal for NF-κB activation, which synergizes with G protein-mediated Ca2+/calcineurin activation to induce CCL2 production.

We also reported the surprising observation that a carboxyl terminus deletion, phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PAFR (mPAFR), which couples to G protein more efficiently than the wild type receptor, did not provide sufficient signal for chemokine CCL2 production.

In the present study, we show that G protein-independent signaling is mediated via the carboxyl terminus of the receptor without involving receptor phosphorylation. We also demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation and the subsequent β-arrestin recruitment inhibits PAF-induced NF-κB activation, Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation, and CCL2 production.

Confocal Microscopy—Cells expressing hemagglutinin-tagged receptors and β-arrestin 2/green fluorescent protein conjugate (β-arr2-GFP) were plated on coverslips in 24-well plates. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm PAF for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 3 volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized by 0.1% saponin (Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature. To visualize receptor expression, cells were incubated with 12CA5 antibody followed by biotin-labeled anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were observed using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100) with a × 100 lens. The GFP was excited using a 488-nm argon laser and detected at emission 515 ± 30 nm, and Cy5 was excited at 647 nm and detected at 660 long pass. Assay of NF-κB Luciferase and NFAT Luciferase Activity—RBL-2H3 and MEF cells were transiently co-transfected with 22.5 μg of PAFR constructs, 7.5 μg of pNF-κB-Luc, or pNFAT-luc plasmid and 0.5 μg of pRL-SV40 Renilla plasmid by electroporation. The following day, cells were serum-starved for 2–4 h and stimulated with 10 nm PAF for another 6 h. Reactions were stopped by washing cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Assay of Chemokine (CCL2) Production—RBL-2H3 cells (0.25 × 106/well) were cultured in complete growth medium overnight. Cells were serum-starved for 2–4 h and stimulated with PAF to a final concentration of 10 nm for 6 h. Supernatants were collected and stored frozen at –80 °C until analysis. CCL2 levels were quantified using sandwich ELISA as described previously (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol.

Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of receptor phosphorylation and G protein-independent signaling on PAF-induced transcription factor NF-κB activation and CCL2 production, we generated two previously characterized mutants of PAFR that do not couple to G proteins (38Le Gouill C.

These mutants were constructed by making single substitutions in the putative internalization motif DPXXY in the seventh transmembrane domain of the receptor. Changing aspartate 289 into alanine (D289A) blocks agonist-induced β-arrestin binding and receptor internalization (38Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, replacing the distal tyrosine residue with alanine (Y293A) abolishes G protein coupling but does not interfere with its ability to interact with β-arrestin or to undergo internalization in transfected COS cells (38Le Gouill C.

We first sought to characterize the properties of D289A and Y293A in transiently transfected basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3, a cell line that we have extensively utilized as a model to study functional regulation of leukocyte chemoattractant receptors (9Ali H.

RBL-2H3 cells transiently transfected with PAFR, and its D289A or Y293A mutants were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and exposed to a concentration of PAF (100 nm) that is 10 times higher than required for optimal receptor phosphorylation (9Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that PAF caused robust phosphorylation of PAFR and Y293A but not D289A mutant (Fig. 1A). The resistance of D289A to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation is not due to inefficient transfection or unequal protein loading as receptor expression for each transfectants was carefully monitored and protein concentration was adjusted to assure that equal numbers of receptor were used for each experiment. To determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on NF-κB activation and chemokine CCL2 production, we generated transient transfectants coexpressing PAFR or its mutants with NF-κB luciferase constructs. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, PAF stimulated NF-κB reporter activity and CCL2 production in cells expressing PAFR but not its D289A or Y293A mutant. To determine the role of carboxyl terminus of PAFR and G protein-independent signaling on PAF-induced responses, we used RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing mPAFR (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22685-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and transiently expressed D289A (Fig. 2A). D289A had no effect on PAF-induced degranulation (Fig. 2B) but significantly enhanced mPAFR-induced NF-κB luciferase activity (Fig. 2C) and CCL2 production (Fig. 2D) and restored them to levels similar to those observed in cells expressing the wild-type receptor (see Fig. 1). These findings demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of PAFR does not regulate degranulation but is required for CCL2 gene expression. It is important to note that mPAFR used in our previous studies was generated by deleting 30 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of PAFR, of which eight are serine and threonine residues (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22685-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 42Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28717-28724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine, specifically, the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced responses, we constructed a substitution mutant in which all Ser/Thr residues on the carboxyl terminus of the receptor were replaced with alanine residues, ΔST-PAFR (Table I). We found that PAF caused phosphorylation of PAFR but not ΔST-PAFR (Fig. 3A). Although the carboxyl terminus of PAFR is required for β-arrestin recruitment (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22685-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 39Chen Z. Dupre D.J. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whether receptor phosphorylation mediates this process is not known. We therefore transfected RBL-2H3 cells expressing PAFR or ΔST-PAFR with βarr2-GFP. As shown in Fig. 3B, PAF caused translocation of βarr2-GFP from the cytosol to the membrane in PAFR cells. In contrast, PAF did not induce this response in ΔST-PAFR cells.Table IAmino acid sequences of the carboxyl terminus of PAFR, a deletion mutant (mPAFR), and phosphorylation-deficient mutant (ΔST-PAFR), in which all Ser and Thr residues were replaced with AlaPAFRSequence298 342▾ ▾PAFRKKFRKHLTEKFYSMRSSRKCSRATTDTVTEVVVPFNQIPGNSLKNmPAFRKKFRKHLAEKFYAMΔST-PAFRKKFRKHLAEKFYAMRAARKCARAAADAVAEVVVPFNQIPGNALKN Open table in a new tab To determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced responses, we generated transient transfectants in RBL-2H3 cells expressing equivalent PAFR and ΔST-PAFR (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, PAF caused ∼2-fold greater degranulation in cells expressing ΔST-PAFR than PAFR. This finding is similar to our previous report with mPAFR and suggests that phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl terminus of PAFR are responsible for desensitization of degranulation. Surprisingly, we found that unlike mPAFR (Fig. 2), PAF caused ∼5-fold greater NF-κB activation in cells expressing ΔST-PAFR when compared with PAFR (Fig. 4C). PAF also caused enhanced CCL2 production in ΔST-PAFR cells (Fig. 4D). These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of PAFR is required for PAF-induced NF-κB activation and CCL2 production and that receptor phosphorylation serves to inhibit these responses. The demonstration that PAF causes greater NF-κB activation and CCL2 production in cells expressing ΔST-PAFR than PAFR (Fig. 4) raises the interesting possibility that β-arrestin could actually provide an inhibitory signal for NF-κB activation and CCL2 production. A constitutively active mutant of β-arrestin (βarr-R169E) has been shown to associate with phosphorylation-deficient mutants of a number of G protein-coupled receptors (43Celver J.P. Lowe J.

To determine the role of β-arrestin on PAF-induced responses, transient transfectants were generated in RBL-2H3 cells coexpressing ΔST-PAFR with βarr-R169E/green fluorescent protein conjugate (GFP-βarr-R169E). As shown in Fig. 5A, GFP-βarr-R169E inhibited PAF-induced degranulation by 52.8 ± 3%. Interestingly, GFP-βarr-R169E blocked PAF-induced NF-κB activation and CCL2 production by 82.3 ± 3 and 88.5 ± 2%, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). These inhibitory effects were specific for βarr-R169E, since GFP or GFP-βarr had no effect on PAF-induced responses. To determine the roles of β-arrestin on PAF-induced NF-κB activation further, we generated transient transfectants in wild-type mouse embryonic cell line (MEF) and a mutant cell line deficient in both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 (35Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, PAFRs were expressed at equal levels in both cell types. Furthermore, PAF caused internalization of its receptor in wild-type but not in β-arrestin knockout MEFs (Fig. 6B). However, PAF stimulated a significantly higher NF-κB activation in β-arrestin knockout MEFs when compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 6C). We have previously shown that PAF-induced chemokine CCL2 production in RBL-2H3 cells requires sustained Ca2+ mobilization (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22685-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Calcinuerin is a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase that dephosphorylates the transcription factor, NFAT, allowing it to translocate to the nucleus, where it combines with the AP-1 complex to regulate the transcription of early cytokine genes (46Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 47Henning S.W. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Calcineurin has been shown to promote the expression of CCL2 in vascular myocytes and to mediate vascular inflammation (48Satonaka H. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Oba S. Takeda R. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A inhibits cytokine gene expression by blocking calcineurin-mediated NFAT activation (46Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar, 49Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine the role of carboxyl terminus of PAFR and receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced calcineurin activation, we coexpressed PAFR, mPAFR, or ΔST-PAFR with NFAT and NF-κB luciferase constructs. As shown in Fig. 7A, PAF caused significantly higher NFAT activation in cells expressing mPAFR and ΔST-PAFR when compared with PAFR. Despite this difference, mPAFR was the least susceptible for PAF-induced NF-κB activation and CCL2 production (Fig. 7, B and C). Cyclosporin A completely inhibited PAF-induced NFAT activation and CCL2 production but only partially blocked NF-κB activation. In the present study, we demonstrate the novel finding that PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression requires the interaction of two signaling pathways. One is G protein-independent, requires the carboxyl terminus of PAFR, and mediates NF-κB activation. The other is G protein-dependent, requires Ca2+ mobilization, and involves the activation of calcineurin-mediated NFAT activation. Surprisingly, we found that phosphorylation of PAFR at Ser/Thr residues within its carboxyl terminus and subsequent β-arrestin recruitment blocks CCL2 gene expression via inhibition of both NF-κB and Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated signaling pathways. We have previously shown that PAF stimulates higher G protein activation and a more robust Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-2H3 cells expressing carboxyl terminus deletion, phosphorylation-deficient mutant, mPAFR when compared with the wild-type receptor (PAFR) (31Ahamed J. Ali H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22685-22691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, PAF did not provide sufficient signal for CCL2 production in cells expressing mPAFR. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that receptor phosphorylation provides a G protein-independent signal that synergizes with Ca2+ mobilization to induce CCL2 production. PAFR mutant D289A, containing a single substitution in the putative internalization motif DPXXY in its seventh transmembrane domain does not interact with β-arrestin but signals via a G protein-independent pathway (38Le Gouill C. Parent J.L. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21289-21295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 39Chen Z. Dupre D.J. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7356-7362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that D289A was resistant to agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation. Furthermore, PAF did not induce NF-κB activation or CCL2 production in cells expressing D289A. Our expectation was that when D289A is coexpressed with mPAFR, it would have little or no effect on PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that D289A restored PAF-induced NF-κB activation and CCL2 production. These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of PAFR, but not receptor phosphorylation, mediates G protein-independent signal for NF-κB activation, which synergizes with Ca2+ mobilization to induce CCL2 gene expression. The role of NF-κB activation on chemokine CCL2 production is well established (19Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31092-31099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 50Oda T. Ueda A. Shimizu N. Handa H. Kasahara T. J.

Blood. 2001; 97: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, Satonaka et al. (48Satonaka H. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Oba S. Takeda R. Goto A. Omata M. Fujita T. Nagai R. Hirata Y. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), recently demonstrated that CCL2 gene expression in vascular myocytes requires Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated calcineurin activation. The ability of D289A to restore PAF-induced CCL2 production in mPAFR cells provided us with an important tool to delineate the roles of distinct signaling pathways on PAF-induced responses. An interesting finding of the present study was that while PAF caused significantly lower NF-κB activation in cells expressing mPAFR when compared with PAFR, the reverse was the case for NFAT activation (see Fig. 7). Despite the fact that PAF stimulated a robust calcineurin-mediated NFAT activation in mPAFR cells, a G protein-independent signal for NF-κB activation by D289A was required to restore CCL2 production. These findings suggest that the carboxyl terminus of PAFR provides a G protein-independent signaling for NF-κB activation, which synergizes with mPAFR-induced Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated signaling pathway to induce CCL2 gene expression. This contention is supported by the finding that a Ca2+/calcineurin inhibitor completely blocked PAF-induced NFAT activation and CCL2 production but only partially inhibited NF-κB activation. An interesting finding of the present study was that although the carboxyl terminus of PAFR is required for PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression, phosphorylation of the receptor at Ser/Thr residues within this domain and the subsequent β-arrestin recruitment inhibits this response. This contention is supported by the following observations. First, PAFR but not ΔST-PAFR interacts with β-arrestin in response to PAF. Second, PAF was more active in stimulating CCL2 gene expression in RBL-2H3 cells expressing ΔST-PAFR when compared with PAFR. Third, a constitutively active mutant of β-arrestin (R169E) caused a substantial inhibition of PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression. Fourth, PAF-induced NF-κB activation was significantly enhanced in β-arrestin knockout MEFs when compared with wild-type MEFs. The mechanism by which receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment inhibit PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression is not known. Recently, it has been shown that interaction of β-arrestin with IκBα or its upstream kinases inhibit NF-κB activation stimulated by some but not all GPCRs (29Gao H. Sun Y. Wu Y. Luan B. Wang Y. Qu B. Pei G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 303-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 30Witherow D.S. Garrison T.R. Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment inhibits PAF-induced NF-κB activation. We further demonstrated that PAF-induced NF-κB activation is enhanced in β-arrestin knockout MEFs when compared with wild-type cells. These findings are consistent with the idea that β-arrestin modifies IκB or its upstream kinases to inhibit PAF-induced CCL2 production in RBL-2H3 cells. We also showed that PAF-induced NFAT activation was enhanced in cells expressing ΔST-PAFR when compared with PAFR and that this Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated response is essential for CCL2 production. This finding suggests that the ability of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment to inhibit CCL2 production involves the modification of at least two components in the PAFR signaling pathway. One involves the inhibition of NF-κB, and the other involves modulation of Ca2+/calcineurin-mediated signaling pathway. In summary, we have shown that PAF-induced CCL2 gene expression requires the carboxyl terminus of PAFR and involves a complex interaction of G protein-dependent and -independent signaling pathways. However, phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues within this region blocks gene expression via the modification of multiple signaling pathways. It is noteworthy that PAFR is not the only GPCR that requires its carboxyl terminus for the induction of NF-κB activation and chemokine production. Schwarz et al. (52Schwarz M. Murphy P.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus stimulates NF-κB activation and CCL2 production and that deletion of the terminal five amino acids on the carboxyl terminus of its GPCR resulted in substantial inhibition of these responses. Most interestingly, Hernandez et al. recently showed that WHIM syndrome, an immunodeficiency disease characterized by neutropenia, is associated with deletion of the carboxyl terminus of the G protein-coupled chemokine receptor 4 (53Hernandez P.A.

Therefore, the mechanism described in the present study for PAF-induced chemokine production is likely to be a general mechanism by which functions of different G protein-coupled receptors are regulated.

Expression analyses demonstrate that DMP1 is differentially regulated in osteoblasts and odontoblasts. Earlier we have reported on the transcriptional regulation of DMP1 by c-Fos and c-Jun (AP-1) transcription factors. Results from earlier study indicate that c-Fos and c-Jun play an important role in early osteoblast differentiation, whereas they do not have a significant effect on the terminally differentiated osteoblasts. In this paper, we demonstrate a regulatory mechanism by which JunB transcriptionally controls the expression of DMP1 during osteoblast differentiation. The cooperative interaction of JunB with p300 has been shown to dramatically modulate the DMP1 promoter activity during mineralization. Immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrate the interaction of JunB and p300 in vivo. Further, phosphorylation of JunB at Ser-79 was found to be essential for its interaction with p300. Intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity of p300 also plays a critical role in regulating DMP1 gene expression.

Osteoblasts and odontoblasts, the principal cells responsible for bone and dentin formation, synthesize extracellular matrix molecules that are responsible for mineralized matrix formation.

Expression analyses demonstrate that DMP1 is differentially regulated in osteoblasts and odontoblasts. During osteoblast differentiation, DMP1 is constitutively expressed, whereas in differentiating odontoblasts the expression is temporally and spatially regulated. In our earlier studies, we have demonstrated that blocking DMP1 expression inhibits osteoblast differentiation (1Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Therefore, identifying factors that are involved in regulating DMP1 expression during osteoblast differentiation will be beneficial in deciphering the relationship between DMP1 expression and osteoblast differentiation. Transcriptional regulations by the AP-1 family of transcriptional factors are known to be mediated by extracellular signals (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

The AP-1 transcription factor is composed of a mixture of homo- and heterodimers formed between Jun, Fos, and ATF families of proteins. AP-1 factors have been a paradigm for transcription factors that are involved in several cellular functions such as apoptosis (5Schreiber M. Baumann B. Cotten M. Angel P. Wagner E.F.

Published studies demonstrate that AP-1 transcription factors regulate the expression of a myriad of genes in a variety of tissues and cell types. Jun family proteins, which include c-Jun, JunB, and JunD, can form a homodimer or heterodimer with Fos family members. c-Jun knockout mice embryos die at midgestation, due to hepatic failure, indicating that neither JunB nor JunD functionally can replace c-Jun (8Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F. Nature. 1993; 365: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 9Johnson R.S. van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice lacking specific members of the Fos and ATF families are viable and fertile, although the adults show specific defects in distinct tissues, implying that only a subset of AP-1 target genes is affected in these mutants (10Johnson R.S.

Specific roles for AP-1 in skeletal development have been identified mainly through knockout studies in mice (14Jochum W. Passegue E. Wagner E.F.

The c-Fos knockout shows a phenotype similar to osteopetrosis due to a complete block in osteoclast differentiation (16Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.-Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). On the other hand, transgenic mice overexpressing c-Fos develop osteosarcomas due to excessive differentiation of osteoblast (17Grigoriadis A.E. Schellander K. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 685-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing Fra-1, a splice variant of FosB, develop osteosclerosis caused by accelerated differentiation of osteoprogenitors into mature osteoblasts (18Jochum W. David J.P.

All of these results suggest that although AP-1 transcription factors have high homology between family members, each of these proteins possesses specific intrinsic function, and therefore they cannot be substituted by other members. The transcriptional cofactor p300 is a large regulatory nuclear phosphoprotein with multiple functional domains. Several conserved motifs have been identified in p300; these include a bromodomain, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) region, and three cysteine-histidine (CH)-rich regions (CH1, CH2, and CH3). The bromodomain is found to play an important role in protein-protein interactions and the association of histones with chromatin (20Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.-M.

Biol. 1999; 287: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Gln-rich region, which is located at the C terminus of the protein, has features similar to those of the glutamine-rich transcriptional activation domains found in a number of transcriptional activators (24Arany Z. Newsome D. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Eckner R. Nature. 1995; 374: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 25Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The CH3 region is the site of interaction with many different factors, which include the adenovirus E1A protein, the coactivator PCAF (26Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), RNA polymerase-containing complexes, and TFIIB (27O'Connor M.J. Zimmermann H. Nielsen S. Bernard H.-U. Kouzarides T. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, other regions in p300 serve as binding sites for a variety of DNA-binding transcriptional activator proteins. p300 has acetyltransferase activity and possesses a region of similarity to members of the GCN5-related N-AT family of proteins (28Neuwald A.F. Landsman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 29Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Earlier we have reported on the transcriptional regulation of DMP1 by c-Fos and c-Jun (AP-1) transcription factors. Results from this study indicate that c-Fos and c-Jun play an important role in early osteoblast differentiation, whereas they do not have a significant effect on the terminally differentiated osteoblasts (30Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate a regulatory mechanism by which JunB transcriptionally controls the expression of DMP1 during osteoblast differentiation. The cooperative interaction of JunB with p300 has been shown to dramatically modulate the DMP1 promoter activity during mineralization. Further, phosphorylation of JunB at Ser-79 was found to be essential for interacting with p300. Intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300 also plays a critical role in regulating DMP1 gene expression. Plasmids—A 3-kb genomic clone containing the 5′ upstream regulatory sequences for the rat DMP1 gene was isolated and characterized (31Thotakura S.R. Karthikeyan N. Smith T. Liu K. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PCR-mediated serial deletions were made and cloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid construct. The expression plasmids for p300 and p300 deletion constructs including p300-AT were generous gifts from Dr. Thimmapaya (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). The expression vector containing p38 kinase and p38 kinase dominant negative constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Philipp E. Scherer (32Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfections—The preosteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured as described earlier (31Thotakura S.R. Karthikeyan N. Smith T. Liu K. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% pencillin/streptomycin, and 1% fungizone. For transient transfections, 5 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with superfect reagent and allowed to form complexes for 15 min. 75% confluent cells were washed with 1× PBS followed by the addition of the DNA-superfect mixture. The cells were incubated for 2 h followed by the addition of fresh media. The cells were harvested for luciferase assay after 24 h of transfections. The transient transfections contained an internal control plasmid containing renilla luciferase. Stable transfections were made with p300 (wild type) and p300-AT (lacking HAT activity) constructs. Transfected cells were selected with G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. The selected cells were propagated and used for further analysis. Dual Luciferase Assay—The dual luciferase assay system was used in all experiments and was obtained from Promega and used in an automated luminometer from Dynex as reported earlier (31Thotakura S.R. Karthikeyan N. Smith T. Liu K. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10272-10277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of the lysate (100 μl) was dispensed into a 96-well microtiter plate and placed in a luminometer. Luciferase activity was measured using Luciferase Assay Reagent II and Stop&Glo reagent. Variations in transfection efficiency was normalized by dividing the measurement for the firefly luciferase activity by Renilla luciferase activity. Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Western blot analysis was performed as described by Towbin et al. (33Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by incubating with primary antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added to the antibody-antigen complex. The beads were washed with PBS containing 10 mm Nacl. The beads were resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE buffer, and proteins were denatured and resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting to analyze the bound complex proteins. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—Expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 3 h to the bacterial culture in the exponential phase of growth. The bacteria were centrifuged, resuspended in EBC buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce)), lysed using a sonicator, and centrifuged to remove bacterial debris. Soluble proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. The GST fusion proteins were then used for a pull-down assay. RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells at log phase with the use of TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA gel electrophoresis and Northern blotting were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was resolved on a 0.8% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred to a Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was prehybridized with the use of PerfectHyb-Plus (Sigma) and probed with randomly labeled (Decaprime kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) probes, washed, and developed overnight. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from MC3T3E-1 cells were isolated for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Briefly, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× protease mixture (Pierce). The cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 × g. The nuclear pellet was further incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 420 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and other protease inhibitors. After the lysis of the nuclei, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min to collect the nuclear extract. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts from MC3T3 cells were prepared as described before. Oligonucleotides (AAGAACATAATGAATTTTAGTCATTTTCTTTCTATTATTTGC) were synthesized, annealed, and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Protein-DNA interactions were performed for 45 min in 4 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 100 ng of poly(dG-dC) along with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Typically, 10 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated with 5 fmol of labeled oligonucleotides. The specificity of the protein-DNA complexes was demonstrated by supershift experiments, which were performed as described above except that the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with JunB antibody. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two oligonucleotides were designed to replace the conserved phosphorylation sites on JunB, namely Ser-79 to Ala and Thr-299 to Ala using the primers (Ser-79, GACACAGGCGCAGCGGCCGCACTAGCCTCC; Thr-299, AAGGTGAAGGCGGCCGCAGCTGAGAACGCG) (codon changes are underlined). Incorporation of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was also performed to disrupt the JunB binding site on the DMP1 promoter using the designed oligonucleotide AATGAATTTTcGaCATTTTCTTTC (lowercase indicates the modified base) and DMP1 promoter as the template. This sequence resides within the region –1950 to –1940 of the DMP1 promoter. HAT Assay—HAT assay was carried out using the HAT assay kit from Upstate USA, Inc. (Charlottsville, VA) (catalog no. 17-289). The assay was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, biotinylated histones were allowed to bind to the streptavidin-coated 96-well assay plates. Upon blocking and washing, protein extracts were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-acetyl-lysine was added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed to remove nonspecific binding, and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was then added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. A colorimetric assay was carried out using TMB substrate mixture (10 min), and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 m sulfuric acid. The color developed was measured at 450 and 570 nm. The 570-nm values were subtracted from the 450-nm values to avoid any variations. Antibodies and Protein Kinase Inhibitors—Monoclonal antibody against the C terminus of mouse JunB was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (catalog no. sc-8051). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of human p300 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (catalog no. sc-585). Monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope was purchased from Sigma. Protein kinase inhibitors SB-203580 (p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase) (100 nm) and PD-98059 (inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase) (3 μm) were obtained from BioMol Inc. Induction of Mineralization—Cells were induced to produce a mineralized matrix as described earlier (1Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown to 80–90% confluence were treated with β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) and ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml) in the presence of dexamethasone (10 nm). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay kit obtained from Upstate Biotechnology was used in this experiment. Briefly, MC3T3-E1 cells were transfected with plasmid containing the DMP1 promoter. The DNA-protein complex was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with PBS containing protease inhibitor mixture and scraped into a conical tube. The cells were lysed with SDS-lysis buffer (provided in the kit) for 10 min. The DNA was recovered with phenol/chloroform and diluted 10 times. This sample is referred to as the input for the experiment. Respective primary antibody was added to the DNA sample and incubated 12–14 h at 4 °C. The antibody complex was allowed to bind to Protein A-agarose for 30 mins at 4 °C. The DNA bound to the immune complexes was extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. The DNA samples were used as templates for PCR to identify the presence of transfected plasmid DNA using specific primers (sense, caacagttgtgttagtttatttgt; antisense, taaagcaacatgctgttcaccacc). Regulation of DMP1 Expression by JunB and p300 —Previously, we demonstrated that AP-1 factors activate DMP1 transcription in MC3T3 cells. We mapped the AP-1 elements of the DMP1 promoter between –1950 and –1940 bp upstream with respect to the transcriptional start site. To determine if the transcriptional activity of DMP1 would be mediated by JunB, transfection assays were performed using MC3T3-E1 cells co-transfected with the JunB expression vector. We also transfected expression vectors containing p300 in combination with JunB in order to analyze the role of p300 on DMP1 promoter activation. Results demonstrate that by itself p300 did not have any significant effect on the DMP1 promoter activity, whereas transfections with JunB increased the DMP1 promoter activity ∼2–3-fold compared with the control (Fig. 1). However, co-transfection of p300 and JunB expression vectors together stimulated the DMP1 promoter by about ∼4–5-fold, indicating that p300 cooperates with JunB in the activation of the DMP1 promoter. In order to identify the binding region within the DMP1 promoter responsible for this activation, serial deletions were made. These constructs were transfected either with JunB alone or with JunB along with p300. Results from these transfection studies indicated that the JunB binding domain in DMP1 is in the region between –2000 and –1500 bp (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, deletion of this region greatly affected the DMP1 promoter activity in the presence of JunB along with p300. Thus, the region between –2000 and –1500 bp is required to execute the JunB- and p300-mediated activation of the DMP1 promoter. Next, a computer program (Matinspector) was used to identify the JunB binding site within this region. Mutations were introduced at this JunB core binding site on the DMP1 promoter and analyzed for promoter activation in the presence of JunB and p300. Site-directed mutagenesis studies revealed that the promoter activity was remarkably suppressed, and no activation was observed even in the presence of JunB and p300 (Fig. 2B). Thus, these studies demonstrate that the predicted JunB binding site resides between –1950 and –1940 bp on the DMP1 promoter and is necessary for its activation. Serine 79 Phosphorylation Is Important for JunB Activation—It is well known that JunB and p300 are nuclear phosphoproteins. In order to determine how phosphorylation regulates their function and thus mediate their activation of the DMP1 promoter, we examined the involvement of kinases responsible for phosphorylation of JunB and p300. The involvement of MAP and p38 kinases was determined by using specific inhibitors. The addition of MAP kinase inhibitor PD98509 to either JunB or p300 alone did not have any significant effect on the reporter activity. On the other hand, the addition of p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 to MC3T3 cells in the presence of JunB along with p300 reduced the DMP1 promoter activity dramatically (equal to the activity of the control) when compared with the reporter activity in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 3). These results clearly demonstrate that phosphorylation by p38 kinase is essential for the regulation of DMP1 transcription by JunB and p300. In order to confirm the involvement of p38K on the DMP1 promoter activity mediated by JunB and p300, we used expression vectors containing p38K and dominant negative p38K, which were characterized earlier (32Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Transfection results clearly demonstrate that p38K wild type in the presence of JunB along with p300 increased the transcriptional activity of the DMP1 promoter by about 2-fold compared with the transfection without p38K. Furthermore, p38K did not have any significant effect on the activation of DMP1 promoter by p300 compared with the promoter activity with p300 alone (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate the important role of p38K in the activation of the DMP1 promoter. This was further confirmed by transfections with the dominant negative p38K in the presence of JunB and p300. Results demonstrate that dominant negative p38K along with JunB and p300 suppresses the DMP1 promoter activity significantly (∼<1-fold) compared with the DMP1 promoter alone (Fig. 4). Thus, these results demonstrate that p38K stimulates JunB- and p300-mediated transcription of DMP1 possibly through direct phosphorylation events. Analysis of the primary sequence of JunB revealed the presence of two potential phosphorylation sites, one at Ser-79 and another at Thr-299. To investigate the role of these potential amino acids on JunB activation by phosphorylation, mutations were made to replace these amino acids with Ala. Results demonstrate that the S79A mutation by itself reduced the transcriptional ability. Moreover, the increased DMP1 promoter activity observed with wild type JunB along with p300 was not observed when transfected with S79A-JunB along with p300. However, mutation at T299A on JunB did not have any effect on the JunB-mediated DMP1 promoter activity either alone or along with p300 (Fig. 5A). Further, p38K failed to activate the S79A-JunB, indicating that this Ser-79 residue is an important phosphorylation site for p38K. Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of JunB at Ser-79 is necessary for the transcriptional activation of DMP1. Interaction of JunB with p300 —Since p300 can cooperate with JunB in the transcriptional activation of DMP1, we therefore determined whether these factors might interact with each other and exist as a complex in vivo. Immunoprecipitation analysis with JunB antibody and cross-blotting with p300 antibody clearly demonstrated the presence of p300 in the complex (∼300 kDa). This result was further confirmed by immunoprecipitaiton with p300 antibody and cross-blotting with JunB antibody (Fig. 6A). Thus, these results confirm the presence of p300 and JunB in an associated complex in vivo. To investigate the association of p300 with the JunB mutations, immunoprecipitations were performed with monoclonal FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate the complex. Immunoprecipitaion with FLAG antibody and cross-blotting with p300 antibody showed that mutation at Ser-79 affected the interaction of JunB with p300. On the other hand, mutation at Thr-299 did not have any effect on the complex formation with p300 (Fig. 6B). The presence of JunB was confirmed with JunB antibody (Fig. 6B). Thus, these results provide further evidence that Ser-79 on JunB is required for the p38K phosphorylation and also for its interaction with p300. To map the region within p300 that binds to JunB, various p300 deletions cloned into the GST fusion vector as reported earlier were used (35Misra P. Qi C. Yu S. Shah S.H. Cao W.Q. Rao M.S. Thimmapaya B. Zhu Y. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20011-20019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A GST pull-down assay on MC3T3-E1 extracts and Western blotting with JunB antibody clearly demonstrate that JunB binds to the C-terminal region of p300 (Fig. 7). Binding of JunB to DMP1 Promoter—The physical interaction of JunB protein to its binding site on DMP1 promoter was studied by mobility shift assay. We have identified an AP-1 site on the DMP1 promoter sequence (between –1950 and –1940 bp). Double-stranded, labeled oligonucleotides were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Competition assay results in Fig. 8A demonstrate the specificity of the binding site. Fig. 8B shows the binding of wild type JunB (lanes 2 and 3), S79A-JunB (lanes 4 and 5), and T299A-JunB (lanes 6 and 7) to the labeled binding sites. Specific supershift in the presence of JunB-specific antibody was also observed. These results further confirmed that mutation at S79A on JunB did not have any effect on the DNA binding property of JunB. ChIP analyses with antibody against p300 further confirmed the endogenous JunB interactions with the DMP1 promoter (Fig. 8C), whereas the Ser-79 mutant failed to interact with p300 (data not shown). HAT Activity during Late Osteoblast Differentiation and Expression of DMP1—The expression of DMP1 increased during osteoblast differentiation. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from different days (corresponding to osteoblast differentiation) showed a linear progressive increase in DMP1 message (Fig. 9A). This result was further co"
https://openalex.org/W2020917928,"Recent investigations, including our own, have shown that specific strains of fibroblasts expressing telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) have an extended lifespan, but are not immortal. We previously demonstrated that hTERT-transduced MRC5 fetal lung fibroblasts (MRC5hTERTs) bypassed senescence but eventually succumbed to a second mortality barrier (crisis). In the present study, 67 MRC5hTERT clones were established by limiting dilution of a mass culture. Whereas 39/67 clones had an extended lifespan, all 39 extended lifespan clones underwent crisis. 11 of 39 clones escaped crisis and were immortalized. There was no apparent relationship between the fate of clones at crisis and the level of telomerase activity. Telomeres were hyperextended in the majority of the clones analyzed. There was no difference in telomere length of pre-crisis compared with post-crisis and immortal clones, indicating that hyperextended telomeres were conducive for immortalization and confirming that crisis was independent of telomere length. Immortalization of MRC5hTERT cells was associated with repression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a and up-regulation of pRB. However, the regulation of pRB phosphorylation and the response of the p53/p21cip1/waf1 pathway were normal in immortal cells subject to genotoxic stress. Overexpression of oncogenic ras failed to de-repress p16INK4a in immortal cells. Furthermore, expression of ras enforced senescent-like growth arrest in p16INK4a-positive, but not p16INK4a-negative MRC5hTERT cells. Immortal cells expressing ras formed small, infrequent colonies in soft agarose, but were non-tumorigenic. Overall, these results implicate the inactivation of p16INK4a as a critical event for overcoming telomere-independent crisis, immortalizing MRC5 fibroblasts and overcoming ras-induced premature senescence.

One characteristic that is common to most (if not all) cancer cells and distinct from normal somatic cells is that cancer cells proliferate indefinitely (they are immortal), whereas the replicative lifespan of normal cells is limited and tightly regulated. The mechanisms that limit the replicative lifespan of normal human somatic cells are therefore thought to function to prevent immortalization and carcinogenesis (1Drayton S. Peters G. Curr. Opin.

When normal somatic cells reach the end of their replicative lifespan, they undergo an irreversible growth arrest, referred to as senescence. Replicative senescent cells arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle and express high levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEM, minimal essential medium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PDs, population doublings; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; RB, retinoblastoma; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; TRF, telomeric restriction fragment; S.D., standard deviation.1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MEM, minimal essential medium; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PDs, population doublings; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside; SA-β-gal, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity; FACS, fluorescent-activated cell sorting; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase; RB, retinoblastoma; TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; TRF, telomeric restriction fragment; S.D., standard deviation. inhibitors (CDKIs), p16INK4a and p21cip1 (2Noda A. Ning Y. Venable S.F. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 3Hara E. Smith R. Parry D. Tahara H. Stone S. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 859-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Further, overexpression of p21cip1, p16INK4a, or p53 (which transcriptionally induces p21cip1) arrests human cells in a senescent-like state in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (4McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Peters G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 351-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Increased expression of p21cip1 inhibits the activity of CDK2-cyclin E complexes, as well as other CDK/cyclin complexes, while p16INK4a specifically sequesters and inactivates CDK4/6 complexes (5Lee M.-H. Yang H.-M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1907-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of these cyclin-CDK complexes prevents phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which is necessary for progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. Hence, accumulation of p16INK4a and p21cip1 appear to be critical mediators of growth arrest in senescent cells. Consistent with this possibility, inactivation of p53, pRB, or p21cip1 was shown to enable normal human cells to proliferate beyond senescence (6Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 7Brown J. Wei W. Sedivy J. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 8Bond J.A. Wyllie F.S. Wynford-Thomas D. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1885-1889PubMed Google Scholar). However, the vast majority of cells that bypass senescence as a consequence of inactivation of these pathways are not immortal, as they ultimately succumb to a second proliferative barrier, called crisis (9Girardi A.J. Jensen F.C. Koprowski H. J. Cell. Comp. Physiol. 1965; 65: 69-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Compelling evidence implicates the gradual shortening of telomeres as an upstream event in the initiation of CDK inhibitor activity and induction of senescence. Telomeres are specialized chromosomal-end structures that prevent abnormal chromosomal fusions and rearrangements (10Blackburn E.H. Nature. 2000; 408: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). In normal human cells telomeres shorten with each cell division. When telomeres become critically short, chromosomal instability ensues and p53-dependent DNA damage signals initiate the senescence program. Senescence may also be triggered by telomere-independent stresses, such as DNA damage caused by irradiation and cytotoxic drugs or chemically induced oxidative stress (11Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Geront. 2000; 35: 927Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition, premature senescence may be induced by expression of oncogenic ras and raf, which signal via the mitogen-activated kinase cascade to induce expression of p16INK4a and p53 (12Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3884) Google Scholar, 13Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3001Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar).In contrast to telomere attrition observed in normal somatic cells, ∼80 –90% of cancer cells and immortal cell lines have telomeres stabilized or elongated by the enzyme telomerase (15Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a ribonuclear protein complex that has a reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as a catalytic domain (16Nakamura T.M. Morin G.B. Chapman K.B. Weinrich S.L. Andrews W.H. Lingner J. Harley C.B. Cech T.R. Science. 1997; 277: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of hTERT was shown to be sufficient to reconstitute telomerase enzyme activity, elongate telomeres, and extend the lifespan of normal human fibroblasts and retinal epithelial cells (17Nakayama J.

In addition, it was reported that expression of hTERT immortalized specific strains of fibroblasts, epithelial, and endothelial cells, without the requirement for molecular alterations in p53/p21cip1 and pRB/p16INK4a pathways, and without phenotypic changes associated with carcinogenesis (21Jiang X.R. Jimenez G. Chang E. Frolkis M. Kusler B. Sage M. Beeche M. Bodnar A.G. Wahl G.M. Tlsty T.D. Chiu C.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 22Morales C.P.

However, other investigators have found reconstitution of telomerase enzyme activity to be insufficient for immortalization keratinocytes, mammary, and adenoid epithelial cells, as well as bone marrow, brain, and mammary-derived endothelial cells (24Kiyono T.

Moore M.A.S. Oncogene. 2004; 21: 4200-4211Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the case of mammary epithelial cells and keratinocytes, inactivation of p16INK4a expression was necessary for hTERT-transduced cells to proliferate beyond senescence (24Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). The apparent inability of hTERT to immortalize specific cell types was proposed to be caused by inadequate culture conditions, which induced p16INK4a expression (30Ramirez R.D. Morales C.P. Herbert B.-S. Rohde J.M. Passons C. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, more recent investigations found no difference in the replicative capacity of hTERT-transduced keratinocytes and bone marrow endothelial cells cultured under alternative culture conditions (29MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. Naiyer A.J. May C. Sadelain M. Rafii S. Moore M.A.S. Oncogene. 2004; 21: 4200-4211Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Reinhwald J.G. Hahn W.C. Ramsey M.R. Wu J.Y. Guo Z. Tsao H.

Overall, these results suggest that a telomere-independent barrier may operate to prevent immortalization of some strains of human epithelial and endothelial cells.There is also a growing body of evidence indicating that expression of catalytically active telomerase is insufficient for immortalization of some strains of human fibroblasts. Our previous study, as well as independent investigations, demonstrated that several different stains of fibroblasts expressing hTERT ceased proliferating after a significantly extended lifespan (32MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Tsutsui T. Kumakura S. Yamamoto A. Kanai H. Tamura Y. Kato T. Anpo M.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In our study of hTERT-transduced MRC5 lung fibroblasts (MRC5hTERT), growth arrest was not permanent, as subsets of mass cultured cells eventually resumed proliferation, and immortal cell lines were established. Similarly, Noble et al. (35Noble J.R. Zhong Z.H. Neumann A.A. Melki J.R. Clark S.J. Reddel R.R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have recently shown that hTERT-transduced human foreskin fibroblasts undergo a period of reduced growth during immortalization. The growth lags observed in hTERT-transduced fibroblast cultures are consistent with the requirement for co-operating molecular events for immortalization. During the period of delayed growth, MRC5hTERT cells exhibited features that were characteristic of cells driven beyond senescence and into crisis by viral oncogenes, which inactivate the p53 and pRB tumor suppressor pathways (6Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 9Girardi A.J. Jensen F.C. Koprowski H. J. Cell. Comp.

Smith P.J. Gire V. Wynford-Thomas D. Wyllie F.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Substantial evidence indicates that crisis in viral oncogene transformed cells is a consequence of critical telomere shortening (38Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 39Halvorsen T.L. Leibowitz G. Levine F. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). However, the growth barrier observed in hTERT-transduced, telomerase positive cultures provides evidence for a telomere-independent crisis. While crisis in oncogene transformed cells has been extensively investigated, hTERT-driven crisis remains largely uncharacterized.In the present study, 67 MRC5hTERT clones were established to enable investigation of hTERT-driven crisis. Our results demonstrate that all MRC5hTERT clones that had an extended lifespan were subject to a telomere-independent crisis, while only 28% of lifespan extended clones escaped crisis and were immortalized. Immortalization was associated with inactivation of p16INK4a, which was not reversed by expression of oncogenic ras. However, the regulation of pRB phosphorylation and function of the p53/p21cip1 pathway was normal in immortal cells. Our results indicate that inactivation of p16INK4a may be necessary to overcome telomere-independent crisis during immortalization of MRC5 fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—MRC-5 human fetal lung fibroblasts were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MRC5hTERT-1 were previously established by retroviral transduction of MRC5 cells with retroviral vector TIG, which encodes hTERT upstream of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and a cDNA encoding the green fluorescence protein (GFP) (32MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MRC5hTERT-1 was referred to as MRC5/TIG-1 in our previous report. Except where otherwise indicated, MRC5 and MRC5hTERT-1 cells were grown in α-Minimal Essential Medium (αMEM) with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units /ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Trace Scientific, VIC, Australia) at 37 °C/5% CO2. MRC5hTERT clones were established by plating the MRC5hTERT-1 mass cultured cells at 66 population doublings (PDs) at a concentration of 20 cells/ml in a 96-well plate and identifying wells containing single cells under an inverted microscope. For colony formation in soft agarose, cells were plated at 10,000/ml in 0.33% agarose (Seaplaque, Cambrex, Rockland, ME)/20% FBS/αMEM over a preformed layer of 0.5% agarose/20% FBS/αMEM and incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2. Colonies of greater than 50 cells each were scored under an inverted microscope on day 14.Telomerase Assay—Telomerase expression was quantified using the PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) as described previously (15Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (6493) Google Scholar). Protein was extracted by lysing cells in CHAPS lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS, 10% glycerol) on ice for 30 min. Supernatant was collected following centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of 2 μg of protein were assayed in 25-μl reactions, which included TS primer, NT primer, and 0.01 amol of internal PCR control (TSNT). Each TRAP assay included a negative control (CHAPS buffer), a positive control (protein extract from the SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line) and the R8 quantification oligonucleotide. PCR products were fractionated through a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized with 0.01% (v/v) SYBR® Green 1 nucleic acid gel stain (Molecular Probes, St. Louis, MI). Images were captured by laser scanning using a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Telomerase activity in each sample, or total product generated (TPG) was calculated as a fraction of TPG in the neuroblastoma control: TPG = 100 × [(T – B)/TSNT]/[(NB – B)/TSNTNB], where abbreviations are as follows; T is sample signal, B is background of negative control, TSNT is the internal control signal, NB is the neuroblastoma signal, and TSNTNB is the signal of the internal control band of the neuroblastoma control.Telomeric Restriction Fragment (TRF) Assay—Genomic DNA was extracted by standard phenol/chloroform procedure and precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol. For TRF assays, 10 μg of DNA was digested with Hinf and RsaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 16 h at 37 °C, followed by electrophoresis through a 0.7% agarose gel. Gels were depurinated, denatured, neutralized, and transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Transfer was by capillary action using 20× SSC for 16 h, before fixing the transferred DNA to the membrane by UV cross-linking (120 mJ) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Chemiluminescence detection of telomeric restriction fragments was performed using the Telo-TAGGG Telomere Length Assay (Roche Applied Science). In brief, the membrane was blocked 30 min at 42 °C and hybridized for 3 h at 42 °C with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled telomere probe. Further washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction before incubating with an anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. CDP-star substrate (Roche Applied Science) was added for detection of telomeres, and the membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Fuji Film, Japan). Images were scanned on a flat bed scanner and TRF signals quantified using MacBas (Fuji). Mean TRF lengths were determined according to the following formula [Σ(Si/Li)]/[ΣSi], where abbreviations are as follows; Si is TRF signal at a given location after background subtraction, Li is the corresponding length at position i (41Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Protein lysates were collected from cell pellets by incubation on ice in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma) for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay (Pierce). For detection of p16INK4a, p21cip1, pRB, and total actin expression, aliquots of 25 μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE through a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). For detection of pRB phosphorylation status, 50 μg of protein was separated on 7%, polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. Membranes were stained with 0.1% (w/v) Ponceau S (Sigma) in 5% aqueous acetic acid to confirm even transfer of proteins, then destained in demineralized water. Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk and hybridized to the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-human p21cip1 monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) 1/500, rabbit anti-human p16INK4a polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE, Nivelles, Belgium) 1/1000, rabbit anti-human actin 1/50000, mouse anti human RB antibody (BD PharMingen) 1/500. Membranes were washed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, and hybridized to the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies; anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) 1:10000 or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) 1:5000, for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using Supersignal (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and images were acquired on x-ray film or Versdoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).Retroviral Transduction—Stable retroviral producers, which generate high titers of the replication defective retroviral vectors L9IGFP and L9NrIGFP, were previously established and generously provided by A/Prof. Geoff Symonds and Dr. Alla Dolnikov (Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research) (42Dolnikov A. Shen S. Millington M. Passioura T. Pedler M. Rasko J.E. Symonds G. Cancer Gene Therapy. 2003; 10: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The L9NrIGFP vector encodes mutant N-ras (N-ras13, G-C transversion at position 763) and a yellow fluorescence protein reporter gene GFPtpz (referred to as YFP in this report) that are linked by an IRES. Expression of N-ras protein was previously shown to correlate with YFP fluorescence (42Dolnikov A. Shen S. Millington M. Passioura T. Pedler M. Rasko J.E. Symonds G. Cancer Gene Therapy. 2003; 10: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). L9IGFP, which encodes YFP alone, was used as a control. For simplicity, the L9NrIGFP and L9IGFP vectors are referred to as Nras-YFP and YFP vectors, respectively, in the present report. Retroviral vectors, encoding wild-type p16INK4a (p16wt), p16INK4a with an inactivating missense mutation (p16M53T) and the control vector, pBABEpuro, were generously provided by Dr. Gordon Peters (Imperial Cancer Research Fund Laboratories, London, UK) (43Huot T.J. Rowe J. Harland M. Drayton S. Brookes S. Gooptu C. Purkis P. Fried M. Bataille V. Hara E. Newton-Bishop J. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8135-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Expression and function of p16wt and p16M53T were previously demonstrated in retrovirally transduced fibroblasts (43Huot T.J. Rowe J. Harland M. Drayton S. Brookes S. Gooptu C. Purkis P. Fried M. Bataille V. Hara E. Newton-Bishop J. Peters G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8135-8143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the present study, plasmid retroviral vectors were transfected into Phoenix A packaging cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection with permission from Garry Nolan of Stanford University) using a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure. MRC5 cells, and MRC5hTERT cells were transduced by overnight incubation in viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) for three consecutive days. Cells transduced with Nras-YFP and YFP were enumerated by flow cytometry using a FACS Caliber flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). Cells transduced with p16wt, p16M53T, and pBABEpuro were selected by growth in 0.8 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) in 10% αMEM.β-Galactosidase Staining—Cells were assayed for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal) at pH 6.0 as previously described (44Dimri G.P. Lee X. Baslie G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelji I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacock M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5609) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were first rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, then fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Sigma) for 12–16 h at 37°C. Cells expressing β-galactosidase activity (stained blue) were scored under an inverted microscope. At least three fields of 50–200 cells were scored for each sample assayed. Values are given are means with S.D.RESULTSMRC5hTERT Mass Cultures and Clones Succumb to Crisis—In our previous study, MRC5hTERT cells that were propagated as a mass culture underwent a growth crisis during immortalization (32MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Crisis was reproducible and appeared to be programmed, as when the MRC5hTERT-1 mass culture was thawed at early passage, then propagated by a different operator, using a different media formulation and FBS from an alternate company, the growth pattern was identical (Fig. 1a). To further investigate crisis, we established 67 MRC5hTERT clones by limiting dilution of the MRC5hTERT-1 culture at 66 PDs. In our hands non-transduced MRC5 cells senesced at 62.5 ± 3.5 PD (32MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Twenty-eight of the MRC5hTERT-1 clones that did not reach confluence in 24-well plates exhibited a senescent morphology. These clones were assumed to be telomerase-negative, non-transduced senescent MRC5 cells, although this could not be tested due to insufficient cell numbers. Since the transduction efficiency of the MRC5hTERT-1 mass culture was 77% (32MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it would be expected that at least 23% of the clones would be non-transduced and therefore not bypass senescence. Thirty-nine clones achieved at least 80 PD and were considered to have an extended lifespan (Table I). However, all 39 extended lifespan clones eventually underwent crisis, which was characterized by a reduction in the expansion rate of the culture (Fig. 1b).

We show that the catalytic efficiency of the removal reaction can vary several hundred-fold in different sequence contexts and is most strongly affected by the nature of the base pair at the 3′-primer terminus and the six base pairs upstream of it. Similar effects of the upstream sequence were observed with primer-templates terminated with 2′,3′-dideoxy-AMP, 2′,3′-dideoxy-CMP, or 2′,3′-dideoxy-GMP. However, the removal of 2′,3′-dideoxy-TMP or 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxy-TMP was much less influenced by upstream primer-template sequence, and the rate of excision of these thymidylate analogues was greater than or equal to that of the other chain-terminating residues in each sequence context tested. These results strongly indicate that the primer terminus and adjacent upstream base pairs interact with reverse transcriptase in a sequence-dependent manner that affects the removal reaction. We conclude that primer-template sequence context is a major factor to consider when evaluating the removal of different chain terminators by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.

Nucleoside analogues are commonly used in treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type I; RT, reverse transcriptase; WT, wild type; HIV-1 RTMDR, mutant HIV-1 RT containing M41L/T69S-AG/L210W/R211K/L214F/T215Y mutations; HIV-1 RTAZT, mutant HIV-1 RT containing D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q mutations; AZT, 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine; AZTMP, AZT monophosphate; ddNMP, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside monophosphate; P/T, primer-template. infection. After they are phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form, these inhibitors can be incorporated by the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) into nascent viral DNA. Since the drugs lack a 3′-OH group, their incorporation prevents further elongation of the DNA chain, and they must be removed before DNA synthesis can resume. Removal can occur through pyrophosphorolysis catalyzed by RT (1Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or through a reaction related to pyrophosphorolysis (2Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc.

Several naturally occurring mutations have been described in RT that increase nucleotide-dependent removal, including mutations associated with thymidine analogue resistance (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y or T215F, and K219Q; also called T-analogue resistance mutations) (3Meyer P.R.

Modeling of ATP into the crystal structure of the HIV-1 RT·DNA primer-template·dNTP complex has suggested that the aromatic ring in ATP can form π -π interactions with the aromatic ring in T215Y or F mutant protein (6Boyer P.L.

Larder B.A. Stuart D.I. Stammers D.K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 10015-10019Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the π -π interaction was strengthened by providing a nucleotide substrate that favors this interaction, the efficiency of excision by the mutant enzyme was preferentially enhanced (8Meyer P.R.

When the π -π interaction was disfavored by a nucleotide substrate containing a nonaromatic ring structure, the removal reaction was much less efficient and only slightly enhanced by the T-analogue resistance mutations (8Meyer P.R.

Studies to identify other interactions between mutant or wild type RT and the excision acceptor substrates may aid in the development of drugs that are refractory to removal. Whereas there is general agreement that the primer-unblocking reaction is an important mechanism for HIV-1 resistance, the preference of RT to remove different chain terminating nucleotides is unclear when results from different laboratories are compared. For example, our laboratory has reported that 2′,3′-dideoxy-AMP (ddAMP) is readily removed from a ddAMP-terminated primer (2Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Miller M.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2179-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An important difference between these studies is the use of primer-templates (P/Ts) with different sequences. Several activities of HIV-1 RT have been shown to depend on sequence context, including preferential pausing at specific sequences during incorporation (18Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), misincorporation of nucleotides at hotspots for mutations (19Bebenek K. Abbotts J. Wilson S.H.

The rate of pyrophosphorolysis by bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase has also been reported to be dependent on sequence context (24Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8322-8328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). We therefore performed a systematic, quantitative study on the effects of P/T sequence on the catalytic efficiency (kexcis/Kd) of the removal reaction. Removal efficiency varied up to 360-fold depending on sequence context and was most influenced by the nucleotides in the seven base pairs of P/T duplex adjacent to and including the primer terminus. P/Ts terminated with ddAMP, ddCMP, or ddGMP were highly sensitive to sequence context, whereas P/Ts terminated with ddTMP or 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxy-TMP (AZTMP) were much less affected. In addition, the removal of ddTMP or AZTMP was more efficient than removal of ddAMP, ddCMP, or ddGMP. These results suggest that ddTMP or AZTMP at the primer terminus gives a complex that is more active in the unblocking reaction and less influenced by sequence-specific interactions between RT and P/T. Materials—His-tagged RT containing wild type RT (HIV-1 RTWT), the M41L/T69S-AG/L210W/R211K/L214F/T215Y mutations (HIV-1 RTMDR) or the D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q mutations (HIV-1 RTAZT) were expressed and purified as previously described (2Meyer P.R.

Poly(rA) and oligo(dT) were from Amersham Biosciences. Other oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma; M13 DNA was from New England Biolabs. [3H]dTTP was from PerkinElmer, and [α-32P]ddATP and [α-33P]ddNTPs were from Amersham Biosciences. [α-32P]AZTTP was prepared as previously described (3Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G.

Generation of Products Terminated with [32P]ddAMP at Different Positions—M13 single-stranded template was annealed with complementary primer 1 (5′-AAGTTGGGTAACGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) or primer 2 (5′-ACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTC-3′), and 5 nm P/T was incubated with 100 nm HIV-1 RTWT,1 μm [α-32P]ddATP, and 10 μm each of the four dNTPs in reaction buffer (40 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, and 80 μg of bovine serum albumin per ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The products were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in DNA buffer (10 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, and 40 mm KCl). ATP-dependent Removal of ddAMP from Products Terminated at Different Positions—Five nm of 3′-[32P]ddAMP-terminated products were incubated with 200 nm HIV-1 RTMDR and 100 nm unlabeled ddATP (to prevent reincorporation of the removed, labeled chain terminator) in reaction buffer containing either no acceptor substrate for removal, 3.2 mm ATP, or 50 μm PPi at 37 °C for 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 min. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 5 min, and the products were separated by electrophoresis through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The radioactivity in the 3′-[32P]ddAMP-terminated products was quantitated by phosphorimaging, and the amount of ATP- or PPi-dependent removal was calculated for each time point. All nucleotides used were pretreated with thermostable pyrophosphatase (25 μmol of nucleotide was treated with 5 units thermostable pyrophosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in 390 μl of reaction buffer at 75 °C for 20 min). ATP-dependent Removal of Chain Terminators from Synthetic DNA/DNA Oligonucleotide P/Ts—A15P primer (5′-ATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGT-3′) annealed to A15T template (5′-CGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGGCAT-3′) or A23P (5′-CGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGTAATCATGGTCAT-3′) annealed with A23T (5′-CACACAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCG-3′) were 3′-32P-labeled and ddAMP-terminated by incorporation of [32P]ddAMP as previously described (2Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. So A.G. Scott W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13471-13476Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Five nm 3′-[32P]ddAMP-terminated P/T was incubated with 200 nm HIV-1 RTMDR, 100 nm unlabeled ddATP, and varying concentrations of ATP for an amount of time allowing a maximum of ∼30–35% Ap4ddA formation. Products were separated by electrophoresis through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The radioactivity in the 3′-[32P]-ddAMP-terminated primer and in Ap4ddA was quantitated by phosphorimaging, and the rate of Ap4ddA formation (kobs) was determined by assuming linearity with incubation time (see legend to Fig. 2B for a discussion of this calculation). Values for kobs were plotted versus ATP concentration and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Sigmaplot 4.0 to obtain the maximum rate of Ap4ddA formation (kexcis) and the dissociation constant for ATP (Kd) for each P/T pair tested. A23-derived P/T pairs were identical to A23 except for the indicated change(s) in the primer sequence and corresponding change(s) in the template sequence. To prepare P/T pairs differing only at the primer terminus, A23-derived oligonucleotides were synthesized that were identical in sequence to A23T except for a substitution of G, C, or A instead of T at the 35th position from the 3′-end. These oligonucleotides were annealed with A23P and terminated, respectively, with [33P]-ddCMP, [33P]ddGMP, [33P]ddTMP, or [32P]AZTMP by incubation with WT HIV-1 RT and the corresponding [α-33P]ddNTP or [α-32P]AZTTP followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting chain-terminated P/T pairs were used for ATP-dependent removal reactions. Removal of ddAMP from Multiple Termination Sites in the M13 Sequence—In order to get an approximate measure of the magnitude of the effect of sequence context on the efficiency of removal by HIV-1 RT, ATP- and PPi-dependent removal of [32P]ddAMP from multiple termination sites in M13 primer-template was determined (Fig. 1). M13 single-stranded DNA was annealed with either primer 1 or primer 2 (for sequence, see the bottom of Fig. 1) and incubated with HIV-1 RTWT, all four dNTPs, and [α-32P]ddATP to extend the primers and create a mixture of products chain-terminated and 3′-end-labeled at each A incorporation site. The mixture of products was purified and incubated with HIV-1 RTMDR in the absence of an acceptor substrate for removal or in the presence of either 3.2 mm ATP or 50 μm PPi (Fig. 1). HIV-1 RTMDR was used in most of these experiments because this enzyme supports ATP-dependent removal of ddAMP at a rate that is >30-fold greater than WT RT (13Meyer P.R. Lennerstrand J. Matsuura S.E. Larder B.A. Scott W.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3871-3877Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the absence of an acceptor substrate (Fig. 1, left lanes), the amount of radioactivity recovered in the chain-terminated products remained constant with incubation time. On the other hand, incubation with either ATP (Fig. 1, middle lanes) or PPi (Fig. 1, right lanes) led to a time-dependent decrease in radioactivity in most of the chain-terminated products corresponding to removal of the [32P]ddAMP residue through the action of RT. Removal was very efficient for certain termination products (e.g. A15, A16, A21, and A22), whereas others remained virtually unchanged, even after a 40-min incubation (e.g. A5, A7, and A23). Table I (left columns) contains a summary of ATP- and PPi-dependent removal at each of the first 30 ddA-termination sites (A1–A30) by HIV-1 RTMDR. The rate of removal ranged from very slow (less than 15% removed in 40 min) for A1, A9, and A10 to very fast (more than 50% removed in 2.5 min) for A15, A22, and A24. There was good agreement between susceptibility to ATP- and PPi-dependent removal, suggesting that the sequence context affects properties of the removal reaction shared by both substrates. Similar experiments were carried out with HIV-1 RTAZT (Table I, right columns), and, although ATP-dependent removal was slower and PPi-dependent removal was slightly faster than with HIV-1 RTMDR, the relationship between rates of removal and the termination site was similar.Table IATP- or PPi-dependent removal of [32P]ddAMP from various sites of M13 primer-template by HIV-1 RTRemoval by HIV-1 RTMDRRemoval by HIV-1 RTAZTPositionATP-dependent removalPPi-dependent removalPositionATP-dependent removalPPi-dependent removalA1–-–-A1–-–-A2++++++A2+++A3+++A3–+A4+++++++A4+++++A5–-–A5–-–A6+++A6-++A7+–-A7–+A8++++++A8++++++A9–-–-A9–--A10–-–-A10-+A11++++++A11++++++++A12–-–-A12–-–A13++++A13++++A14+++++A14+++++++A15+++++++++A15++++++++++A16+++++++A16+++++++A19+++++A20++++++++A21++++++A22+++++++++A23––A24+++++++++A25+++++++A26++++++++A27+++++++A28+++A29+++++A30++++++++ Open table in a new tab ATP-dependent Removal of ddAMP from Oligonucleotides Corresponding to a Poor Substrate (A23) and a Good Substrate (A15) for the Removal Reaction—Two termination sites, A15 and A23, were chosen for further characterization. DNA 34-mer primers and 50-mer templates corresponding to each of these M13 sequences were synthesized, purified, annealed, and terminated with [32P]ddAMP. These primer-templates (designated A15 P/T and A23 P/T) were incubated with HIV-1 RT and ATP. The Ap4ddA removal product was quantitated by phosphorimaging, and the rates of removal were determined as a function of ATP concentration (Fig. 2, A and B). The data were fitted to hyperbolae to determine the catalytic efficiencies (kexcis/Kd) (Fig. 2C) of removal. Removal of ddAMP from the A15 P/T was >50-fold more efficient than removal from A23 P/T. In order to determine which parts of the sequences were important determinants for removal efficiency, additional oligonucleotides were prepared in which different parts of the A23 P/T sequence were replaced by the corresponding A15 P/T sequence (Fig. 2C). The data show that the first 10 nucleotides upstream from the 3′-primer terminus made the most significant contribution to removal efficiency, with some additional contribution from the bases located 11–20 bases upstream. Replacement of a portion further upstream or the single-stranded downstream portion of the template had little influence on removal efficiency. Effects of Base Substitutions in the A23 P/T on ATP-dependent Removal of ddAMP—The contribution to ATP-dependent removal of each of the 10 base pairs upstream of the 3′-primer terminus was assessed by measuring the catalytic efficiencies of ATP-dependent removal of ddAMP from 30 A23-derived primer-templates, each containing a different, single nucleotide change at one of the 10 positions in the primer (and corresponding change in the template) (Fig. 3 and Table II). The nucleotide at each position in the original A23 primer sequence is shaded. Substitution at several positions resulted in large increases in removal; a change from dC to dA or dG at position –4 increased removal by 7- and 5-fold, respectively, whereas a change from dT to dG at position –5 increased removal by 5-fold. Other changes led to more modest increases in removal (dT to dA at position –2, 3-fold increase; dA to dT at position –3, 2-fold increase; dT to dA at position –5, 2-fold increase). Although the A23 P/T sequence was an inefficient substrate for removal, sequence changes at some positions decreased removal activity even further. A change from a dG to dA at position –6 decreased removal by 6–7-fold, and a change from dG to dC at position –7 decreased it by about 4-fold. Most other substitutions changed the efficiency of removal less than 1.6-fold, including all changes at positions –8 to –11.Table IIEffects of single base pair substitutions in the upstream region of A23-P/T on ATP-dependent removal Open table in a new tab Next, we determined the effects of introducing multiple changes into the A23 P/T sequence (Table III). Introducing the three substitutions that had conferred the lowest removal (as determined from Table II), dG at position –3, dA at position –6, and dC at position –7, led to a decrease in removal of about 15-fold, whereas introducing the three changes that increased removal the most (dA at position –2, dA or dG at position –4, and dG at position –5) conferred an increase of about 24-fold in ddAMP removal. Therefore, the effects of upstream sequence substitutions were slightly less than additive.Table IIIEffects of multiple base pair substitutions in the upstream region of A23 P/T on ATP-dependent removalkexcis/KdaNumbers in parentheses show kexcis/Kd expressed as a ratio to the value obtained with ddAMP-terminated A23 P/T.M-1 × S-1A230.063 (1.0×)A23-3G,-6A,-7C (three worst sequence changes)0.0041 (0.065×)A23-2A,-4A,-5G (three best sequence changes)1.1 (17×)A23-2A,-4G,-5G (alternative three best sequence changes)1.5 (24×)a Numbers in parentheses show kexcis/Kd expressed as a ratio to the value obtained with ddAMP-terminated A23 P/T. Open table in a new tab Comparison of Sequences Preceding Sites in M13 That Are “Poor” Substrates for Removal with Those Preceding Sites That Are “Good” Substrates for ddAMP Removal—To assess whether the effects of upstream sequence we had observed were unique to the A23 P/T sequence, we compared the primer sequences of the 10 bases upstream of six poor removal sites and of 10 efficient removal sites in the M13 sequence (Table IV). Base frequencies at each position are summarized in Table V. Among the poor removal sites, dA did not appear at primer position –2, dT did not appear at position –3, and dG did not appear at position –4 or –5, which is in very good agreement with the fact that introducing these bases at positions –2, –3, –4, and –5 in the A23 P/T sequence increased removal activity (Table II). On the other hand, of the 10 termination sites that were efficient substrates for removal, dA occurred four times at primer position –2, dT five times at position –3, and dG six times at position –4. Strikingly, none of them had dA at position –6.Table IVUpstream primer sequences of termination sites that are poor versus good substrates for ATP-dependent removalTermination siteUpstream primer sequences of poor removal sites-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1A15′-ACGACGTTGTddAA55′-TTGTAAAACGddAA95′-CCAAGCTTGCddAA105′-GCATGCCTGCddAA125′-GGTCGACTCTddAA235′-TCATGGTCATddATermination siteUpstream primer sequences of good removal sites-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1A155′-ATCCCCGGGTddAA165′-CCGGGTACCGddAA205′-CGAATTCGTAddAA215′-ATTCGTAATCddAA225′-AATCATGGTCddAA245′-TTCCTGTGTGddAA255′-TCCTGTGTGAddAA265′-CCTGTGTGAAddAA275′-TGAAATTGTTddAA305′-TCCGCTCACAddA Open table in a new tab Table VSummary of the upstream sequences of ddAMP-termination sites in M13 that are poor versus good substrates for ATP-dependent removalBaseSummary of upstream sequences of six poor removal sites-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2A1032121110C1401122122G2120420031T2113003403BaseSummary of upstream sequences of 10 good removal sites-11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2A3122202214C3444222122G0213323622T4331373152 Open table in a new tab These results are in good agreement with the effects seen on removal by changes in the A23 P/T sequence (Table II), with some exceptions. The introduction of dT at position –6 in the A23 P/T sequence was associated with little change in the rate of removal, whereas 7 of 10 sites with efficient removal have a dT at this position. In addition, dC at position –7 in A23 P/T conferred a 4-fold decrease in rate of removal, yet 2 of 10 termination sites in the M13 sequence that supported efficient removal had dC at position –7. These exceptions suggest that our understanding of the role of the sequence elements at positions –6 and –7 is still incomplete. In summary, our data suggest that introduction of specific bases at certain positions in a DNA primer, including dA at position –2, dT at position –3, dG at position –4 or –5, and possibly dT at position –6 (with the corresponding changes in the template strand) confer an increased rate of ATP-dependent removal of ddAMP from the primer terminus, whereas the presence of a dA at position –6 or dC at position –7 produces a primer-template that is less susceptible to this reaction.

The enzymes are multidomain, zinc-dependent endopeptidases with a common structural feature, they all share the same tertiary configuration, termed “metzincin” fold, at the catalytic domain. Despite the similarity in structure, the functions of MPs are enormously diverse. To name a few, matrix degradation, transmembrane protein shedding, and regulation of growth factors are just some of the many physiologic processes that are known to involve the MPs (reviewed in Refs. 1Brinckerhoff C.E.

There are four variants of mammalian TIMPs (TIMP-1 to -4), and each TIMP has its own profile of MP selectivity. For instance, whereas the majority of the soluble MMPs are well inhibited by all TIMP-1 to -4, membrane type MMPs and MMP-19 are less sensitive to TIMP-1 (4English W.R. Puente X.S. Freije J.M.

The molecules are composed of two recognizable domains: (i) a distinctly oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding-folded N-terminal domain that encompasses nearly two-thirds of the total molecule and (ii) a structurally less well defined C-terminal domain that is largely made up of β-sheets (11Tuuttila A.

As a natural MP inhibitor, TIMP exerts its functions by slotting its “MMP-binding ridge” into the active site cleft of the target MP in a manner similar to a substrate. The result is the formation of a high affinity 1:1 stoichiometric enzyme-inhibitor complex. This MMP-binding ridge, by its very definition, is decisive for MP association and consists largely of the first four residues at the N terminus, the AB-loop and the CD- and EF-connecting loops of the molecule. The precise molecular elements that govern the selectivity profile of a TIMP are infrequently discussed in the literature, far less studied.In this work, we examine the issue of MP-TIMP selectivity using TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE, ADAM-17) as the model MP. Among the ADAM proteinases uncovered, TACE is the best characterized to date. The enzyme is unique among the MPs, in function and TIMP sensitivity alike. Functionally, TACE is thought to be involved in the shedding of an array of cell surface-anchored bioactive molecules; notable examples include the growth factors pro-TNF-α and fractalkine, receptors such as Notch, TNF-α receptors I and II, as well as molecules that are associated with cell adhesion such as L-selectin (reviewed in Ref. 14Kheradmand F. Werb Z. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In terms of TIMP sensitivity, TACE displays a markedly different reactivity profile from those of the MMPs. Although the majority of the MMPs are sensitive to more than one species of TIMPs, TACE is exclusively inhibited by TIMP-3. TIMP-1, -2, and -4 are poor inhibitors of the enzyme (6Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P.E. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J. Murphy G.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17562-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).In our previous mutagenesis study with TIMP-1 (15Lee M.H. Rapti M. Knauper V. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17562-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we showed that replacement of the threonine 98 (Thr98) residue by leucine (T98L) transformed the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 (N-TIMP-1) into a fully active, slow, tight binding inhibitor against TACE. Thr98 is situated just before the second disulfide bond on the EF-loop, and the equivalent residues in TIMP-2, -3, and -4 are, without exception, leucine. It is precisely this reason that Thr98 was chosen for mutation in the study. To become a TACE inhibitor that exhibits slow, tight binding characteristics, we further showed that the requirement for leucine at the Thr98 locus is absolute. A direct implication of the findings, however, is a conundrum: if leucine is so critical for TACE recognition, why are TIMP-2 and -4 such poor TACE inhibitors even though both are endowed with leucine at the equivalent positions (i.e. Leu100 in TIMP-2; Leu-101 in TIMP-4)? It is thus the aim of the current study to address this issue.To this end, we generated a series of TIMP-2 variants using the N-terminal domain of the molecule (N-TIMP-2) as a scaffold. The mutants, each carrying a different mutation at the MMP-binding ridge, were subjected to in vitro assays with TACE, and the inhibitory behavior was monitored throughout the mutagenesis process. In accordance with the design and progress of the work, the results are presented in three sections. In the first section, we dissect the MMP-binding ridges of TIMP-2 and -3 and a TIMP-1 variant to delineate the amino acid composition that is essential for TACE recognition. The combined effects of “good” mutations leading to the creation of a new, potent TIMP-2 variant will be described. The second section deals specifically with the AB-loop of TIMP-3. The vital role of phenylalanine 34 (Phe34), a residue unique to TIMP-3, will be the subject of discussion. In the last section, we devote our investigation to Leu100, a residue that has previously been reported to be the key of TIMP-TACE recognition, and analyze the impacts of its mutation on TIMP-TACE interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma.

To simplify recombinant protein purification, a hexa-histidine tag was added to the C termini of all N-TIMP-2 constructs in this work. Mutations were introduced into the cDNAs by either forward or reverse primers, depending on the loci and the ease of sub-cloning. All constructs were sequenced to rule out any unintended mutations introduced during the mutagenesis process.Production, Refolding, and Activity Assessment of N-TIMP-2 by Titration—N-TIMP-2 mutants were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli and refolded using the protocol originally developed for N-TIMP-1 (18Lee M.H.

All mutants were amenable to in vitro refolding, and the final yields were comparable to those generated by the method developed by Williamson et al. (19Williamson R.A. Natalia D. Gee C.K. Murphy G.

Reactions were initiated by adding quenched fluorescence peptides to a final concentration of 1 μm. All data were fitted into competitive tight binding equations with the computer program Grafit to obtain an estimation of Kiapp values with Equation 1 (21Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T.

The rate of inhibition was monitored using a continuous fluorometric assay at 27 °C until steady state was reached. The progress curve was analyzed using Equation 2 (21Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T.

Rapti M. Knauper V. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17562-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Although the backbone of this mutant was essentially of TIMP-1 origin, the composition of its MMP-binding ridge has been extensively modified. Apart from the valine 4 to serine (V4S) mutation at the N terminus, its AB-loop is, in reality, derived from TIMP-3 (TIMP-3 AB-loop). Furthermore, the original valine 69 and threonine 98 residues on the CD- and EF-loops have also been replaced by leucine (V69L and T98L). The binding affinity of the mutant with the catalytic domain of TACE (Ki 0.14 nm) surpasses even that of wild-type TIMP-3 (Ki 0.22 nm). As discussed in the introduction, the key element that ensures the successful transformation of TIMP-1 into an active, slow, tight binding TACE inhibitor is the T98L mutation. The reason TIMP-2 fails to become a good TACE inhibitor despite the presence of a leucine (i.e. Leu100) on the EF-loop (Fig. 1B), we surmise, is most likely to be due to the lack of ideal amino acid composition on other sections of the MMP-binding ridge, the principal candidates being the N terminus and the AB- and CD-loops.Hence, to delineate the molecular basis of the inactivity of TIMP-2 against TACE, we modeled our N-TIMP-2 mutagenesis on two templates: the wild-type N-TIMP-3 as well as the N-TIMP-1 mutant harboring the aforementioned V4S/TIMP-3 AB-loop/V69L/T98L mutations. In terms of strategy, two criteria were followed throughout the process: (i) The amino acid composition of the N terminus and AB- and CD-loops of N-TIMP-2 was mutated systematically to mimic those of the two templates. The design of the mutants was based, however, on sequence alignment rather than the available structures of TIMPs in the Protein Data Bank. In addition, the loci chosen for mutation were restricted to the residues located within the MMP-binding ridges (ii) to study the effects of AB-loop on TACE inhibition, parts of the AB-loop of TIMP-2 were truncated or replaced. The length of the AB-loops in the resultant N-TIMP-2 mutants, however, was rendered to be exactly the same as those of the templates.First Generation MutantsN-terminal Mutants S2T, V6P, and V6S—Among the first six amino acids constituting the very N termini of the TIMP variants in Fig. 1A, there are two discernable point differences: residues 2 and 6 (Fig. 1B). In both TIMP-3 and the TIMP-1 variant, the second residues are, coincidently, threonine (Fig. 1A). The second amino acid of TIMP is critically important in TIMP-MP interaction, because it is the side chain of this residue that projects into the S1′ specificity pocket of the catalytic cleft, and hence determines the selectivity profile of a TIMP to a certain degree (22Maskos K. Bode W. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 25: 241-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We mutated serine 2 to threonine (S2T), and kinetic analysis suggested slight improvement in binding affinity with TACE (Kiapp S2T of 547 nm versus wild-type N-TIMP-2 of 893 nm). The second point difference is at residue 6. In N-TIMP-3 and the N-TIMP-1 variant V4S/TIMP-3 AB-loop/V69L/T98L, the 6th residues are serine and proline, respectively. Structurally, this amino acid is located right at the junction between the N terminus and the first α-loop (hI) of TIMP, although co-crystal structures of TIMP-MP rule out any direct interaction with the catalytic pockets of MP (MT1-MMP/TIMP-2, PDB number 1BUV; stromelysin-1/TIMP-1, PDB number 1UEA). Hence, we generated two mutants at this point, i.e. Val-6 to proline (V6P) and Val-6 to serine (V6S) mutants in an effort to study their effects on TACE binding. Of the two, V6P has slightly better binding affinity with TACE, its Kiapp value of 577 nm being marginally superior to that of the V6S mutant (864 nm) (Table I).Table IInhibition constant (Kiapp) and association rate constant (kon) of TACE with first generation N-TIMP-2 mutants The MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-2 was mutated to mimic those of the wild-type N-TIMP-3 and the N-TIMP-1 variant V4S/TIMP-3 AB-loop/V69L/T98L. Due to the low affinity, there is no discernable pattern of slow, tight-binding inhibition.MutantKiappnmWild-type N-TIMP-2893 ± 126First generation mutantsN-terminalS2T547 ± 105V6P577 ± 57V6S864 ± 97AB-loopΔTIMP-2 AB-loop12,417 ± 108TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant22 ± 2.5CD-loopS69E1,145 ± 557A70S486 ± 39V71L219 ± 31 Open table in a new tab AB-loop Mutants—An interesting structural feature that distinguishes the four mammalian TIMPs is the length of their AB-loops. As shown in Fig. 2A, TIMP-2 and -4 have significantly longer AB-loops than TIMP-1 and -3. Situated at the edge of the MMP-binding ridge, the exact role of the AB-loop in MP selectivity has been a subject of constant speculation over the years. Indeed, the delineation of TIMP-2/MT1-MMP co-crystal structure (PDB 1BUV) in 1998 and subsequent mutagenesis study confirmed the significance of the AB-loop in MP association (23Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knäuper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32966-32970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this study, two AB-loop mutants of the same length were created, each for a different reason. The architecture of their construction is shown in Fig. 2B. The first mutant, termed ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop mutant, was designed to find out if the lengthy AB-loop of TIMP-2 poses a steric hindrance when it comes to TACE binding. Our kinetic analysis shows that N-TIMP-2 with a shortened AB-loop is, in fact, an even poorer inhibitor than that of wild-type N-TIMP-2 (Table I). The Kiapp value of the mutant (Kiapp > 12 μm) was over an order of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type protein. The second mutant, termed “TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant” is, in fact, a ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop mutant carrying 3 residues (i.e. Phe34-Gly35-Thr36) of the TIMP-3 AB-loop origin. With a Kiapp value of just 22 nm, the binding affinity of this mutant is far superior to that of the N-TIMP-2.Fig. 2A, N-TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4. The AB-loops of TIMP-2 and -4 are significantly longer than those of TIMP-1 and -3, as highlighted by boxes. Here, we show that the Phe34 residue at the tip of the TIMP-3 AB-loop is critical for TACE association. B, the sequences of (i) the AB-loops of wild-type TIMP-2 and -3; (ii) ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop mutant; and (iii) “TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant” mutant. ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop mutant was created by removing 6 residues (33NDIYGN38) from the AB-loop of TIMP-2. To generate “TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant” mutant, we replaced the amino acids 40IKR42 of ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop mutant with 3 residues, 34FGT36, of TIMP-3. Hence, both the ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop and “TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant” mutants possess AB-loops of the same length as that of the wild-type TIMP-3. The diagram is modified from the AB-loop constructs by Williamson et al. (23Williamson R.A. Hutton M. Vogt G. Rapti M. Knäuper V. Carr M.D. Murphy G. J. Biol.

Valine 71, in particular, is singled out in this work because its TIMP-1 counterpart, valine 69, has been successfully exploited for the development of a TACE-active TIMP-1 variant (Fig. 1B) (15Lee M.H. Rapti M. Knauper V. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17562-17569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alanine 70 and the preceding residue, serine 69, however, were chosen for mutation on the basis that the corresponding residues in N-TIMP-3 and the N-TIMP-1 variant V4S/TIMP-3 AB-loop/V69L/T98L are identical (Fig. 1a). Indeed, valine 71 to leucine (V71L) mutation produced the greatest improvement in binding affinity (Kiapp 219 nm) followed by alanine 70 to serine (A70S) mutation (Kiapp 486 nm). Substitution of serine 69 by glutamate (S69E), on the other hand, impaired the affinity of N-TIMP-2 moderately (Kiapp > 1100 nm) (Table I).The Effects of Combining Good MutationsAmong the first generation mutants created so far, S2T, V6P, TIMP-3 AB-loop, A70S, and V71L are considered the “good mutations” for the simple reason that they enhance the affinity of N-TIMP-2 for TACE. Compared with the others, TIMP-3 AB-loop mutant undoubtedly displays the highest affinity toward TACE. To investigate the effects of combining these good mutations, we generated a series of compounded mutants, each carrying an extra mutation, and measured their association profile with TACE. The results are shown in Table II. Indeed, combination of good mutations resulted in a severalfold increase in binding affinity, the best mutant being the one bearing S2T/TIMP-3 AB-loop/A70S/V71L quadruple mutations (Kiapp of 1.49 nm). Strangely, even though V6P has been shown to be contributory toward TACE inhibition as an individual mutation, addition of this mutation to the rest only reduces the affinity of the resultant mutant. All compounded mutants display an inhibitory pattern typical of that of a slow tight binding inhibitor (Fig. 3). The association rates (kon) of the mutants are within the range of 5–10 × 104m-1 s-1, indistinguishable from that of the N-TIMP-1 mutant V4S/TIMP-3 AB-loop/V69L/T98L generated in our previous study (kon of 7.6 × 104m-1 s-1). From the calculated dissociation rate (Koff) profile, there is no doubt that the improvement in affinity is largely due to a reduction in the dissociation rate of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (Table II).Table IIThe inhibition constant (Kiapp), association rate (kon), and dissociation rate (Koff) of TACE with N-TIMP-2 with compounded mutations The good mutations, namely, S2T, V6P, TIMP-3 AB-loop, A70S, and V71L were combined in a step-wise manner to generate four compounded mutants, each bearing an extra mutation than its predecessor.

Combination of the first generation mutations enhance the binding affinity of the resultant N-TIMP-2 mutants against TACE; the inhibitory patterns of TIMP-3 AB-loop/V71L and S2T/TIMP-3 AB-loop/A70S/V71L are typical of those of the slow, tight binding inhibitors.

Because the AB-loops of the ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop and TIMP-3 AB-loop transplant mutants are of the same length, it is remarkable that variation in a mere 3 amino acids could bring about a difference of over 550-fold in affinities for TACE (TIMP-3 AB-loop 22 nm versus the ΔTIMP-2 AB-loop of 12417 nm). This poses the question: which amino acid(s) within the TIMP-3 AB-loop is(are) the contributing residue(s) in TACE binding? Comparing the amino acid composition of the two constructs, the answer appeared to be straightforward: it must either be the phenylalanine (Phe34), the glycine (Gly35), the threonine (Thr36), or, alternatively, a combination of the 3 residues (numbering in accordance with TIMP-3 sequence). Due to the lack of a side chain in glycine, Phe34 or Thr36 seemed to be the more likely suspects. Using the N-TIMP-2 mutant S2T/TIMP-3 AB-loop/A70S/V71L created in this work as a prototype, we further generated two mutants: one with Phe34 to glycine (F34G) mutation and the other with Thr36 to glycine (T36G) mutation.

https://openalex.org/W1989141762,"A model has been proposed for the structure of the Glut1 glucose transporter based on the results of mutagenesis studies and homology modeling in which eight transmembrane segments form an inner helical bundle surrounded by four outer helices. The role of transmembrane segment 3 in this structural model was investigated using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in conjunction with the membrane-impermeant, sulfhydryl-specific reagent, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS). Twenty-one Glut1 mutants were created from a fully functional, cysteine-less, parental Glut1 molecule by successively changing each residue along transmembrane helix 3 to a cysteine. The single cysteine mutants were then expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and their expression levels, transport activities, and sensitivities to pCMBS were determined. Cysteine substitution at methionine 96 abolished transport activity, whereas substitutions at the other positions resulted in either modest reductions or no significant effect on transport activity. In striking contrast to all other helices that have been examined to date, only one of the 21 helix 3 single-cysteine mutants was inhibited by pCMBS, suggesting that only a small portion of this helix is exposed to the external solvent. This result is consistent with predictions based on our current structural model, in which helix 3 is one of four outer helices that surround the inner helical bundle that comprises the aqueous substrate-binding cavity.

Facilitated diffusion of glucose across the membranes of animal cells is mediated by members of the Glut (SLC2a) family of membrane glycoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Baldwin S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Physiol. 1992; 54: 911-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The Glut family belongs to the major facilitator superfamily that includes several hundred proteins involved in the transport of small molecules across membranes (4Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. (Wash., D. C.). 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glut1 is one of the most extensively investigated membrane transport systems (5Mueckler M. Hresko R.C. Sato M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 951-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses of glucose transport in human red blood cells and on Glut1 purified from red cells are mostly consistent with a simple alternating conformation mechanism (6Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Agre P. Parker J.C. Red Blood Cell Membranes. 11. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 597-634Google Scholar). Based on hydrophobicity analysis, Glut1 was predicted to possess 12 transmembrane helices (7Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Strong support for this prediction has been provided by a number of experimental observations, including a comprehensive glycosylation-scanning mutagenesis study (8Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of the 12 proposed transmembrane segments were predicted to form amphipathic α-helices, an observation that led to the hypothesis that these helices form the walls of a water-filled cavity involved in the binding and translocation of glucose across the lipid bilayer (7Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl- and amide-containing amino acid side chains within these helices were predicted to form the sugar-binding site(s) of Glut1 via hydrogen bond formation with glucose hydroxyl groups (9Barnett J.E.G. Holman G.D. Munday K.A. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) of Glut1 in the formation of an inner helical bundle that comprises a water-accessible cavity within the membrane. This model is also supported by homology modeling of Glut1 based on the high-resolution structures of the lactose permease (17Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (18Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), two bacterial members of the major facilitator superfamily. Homology modeling of Glut1 suggests that helices 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 comprise an inner bundle of transmembrane helices that form a water-filled substrate-binding cavity near the center of the bilayer. Helices 3, 6, 9, and 12 are predicted to surround this inner helical bundle. In this study cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used in conjunction with a sulfhydryl-specific chemical reagent to examine the specific role of transmembrane segment 3 in the predicted structure of Glut1. In contrast to all other helices that have been studied to date, our results suggest that only one of the 21 residues that comprise helix 3 is accessible to the external solvent. These data thus suggest that helix 3 lies outside of the inner helical bundle and does not comprise a portion of the substrate-binding cavity, a conclusion that is consistent with the predicted structure of Glut1 based on homology modeling.

Two days after injection, groups of ∼20 oocytes were incubated for 15 min in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of pCMBS in Barth's saline at 22 °C. The 100× concentrated reagent stock was prepared in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control oocytes were treated with the appropriate concentration of vehicle alone. After a 15-min incubation period, the oocytes were washed four times in Barth's saline and then used for the determination of [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake (50 μm, 30 min at 22 °C). Specific Activity Determinations—Membranes were prepared 3 days following injection of 50 ng of mutant RNA per oocyte. Western blot analysis of each of the mutant transporters was performed on ∼1 μg of total membrane protein, and the intensity of the Glut1 band was quantified by scanning densitometry using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager SI. Analysis was performed using the ImageQuant NT program (version 4.0). [3H]2-Deoxyglucose uptake (picomole/oocyte/30 min) of each mutant was concomitantly determined in each set of experiments. Specific activity is expressed as the 2-deoxyglucose uptake per nanogram of mutant Glut1 protein expressed per microgram of total oocyte membrane protein, and the data were then normalized by assigning the uptake activity of the parental cysteineless (C-less) protein a value of 1.0. Purified human erythrocyte membranes were loaded on the same gels as the oocyte membrane samples for use as quantitative standards. Statistical Analysis—Uptake data were analyzed for statistical significance using the two-tailed, unpaired Student t test. The creation of a functional C-less human Glut1, in which all six native cysteine residues were changed to either serine or glycine residues, has been described previously (24Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The transport activity of C-less Glut1 is nearly indistinguishable from that of the wild-type transporter when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (24Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Wellner M. Monden I. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating that none of the native cysteine residues is required for function. Oligonucleotide-mediated site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce 21 mutant cDNAs in which each amino acid residue within the predicted transmembrane helix 3 of C-less Glut1 was individually changed to a cysteine residue (see Table I).Table ICysteine scanning mutagenesis of helix 3Residue no.Amino acid changeCodon change96Met → CysAGT → TGT97Leu → CysCTG → TGT98Met → CysATG → TGT99Met → CysATG → TGT100Asn → CysATG → TGT101Leu → CysCTG → TGT102Leu → CysCTG → TGT103Ala → CysGCC → TGC104Phe → CysTTC → TGC105Val → CysGTG → TGT106Ser → CysTCC → TGC107Ala → CysGCC → TGC108Val → CysGTG → TGT109Leu → CysCTC → TGC110Met → CysATG → TGT111Gly → CysGGC → TGC112Phe → CysTTC → TGC113Ser → CysTCG → TGT114Lys → CysAAA → TGT115Leu → CysCTG → TGT116Gly → CysGGC → TGC Open table in a new tab The single-C mutants were expressed in stage 5 X. laevis oocytes after injection of the corresponding mRNAs. Verification that the mutants were expressed in the oocyte plasma membrane was determined by indirect immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy using a polyclonal antibody direct against the C-terminal 15 residues of Glut1 (Fig. 1a). Expression levels were quantitated by Western blot analysis of purified oocyte membranes using the same antibody (Fig. 1b). Consistent with our analyses of other transmembrane helices, the expression levels of the different helix 3 single-C mutants varied considerably, necessitating that the uptake data be normalized to the membrane content of Glut1 protein to directly compare the catalytic activities of the mutants to their C-less parent. Transport activity above the very low endogenous oocyte background level was detectable for all 21 mutants as determined by uptake of [3H]2-deoxyglucose. The raw uptake data are shown in Fig. 2a and the specific transport activities, normalized to the membrane content of each mutant and with the activity of C-less assigned a value of 1.0, are presented in Fig. 2b. Ten of the 21 mutants exhibited specific transport activities that were modestly reduced relative to the parental C-less protein. The S106C mutant exhibited a ∼2-fold increase in specific activity relative to C-less, whereas the M96C mutant exhibited extremely low transport activity, suggesting that this residue plays an important role in the structure and function of Glut1. To determine which, if any, of the transmembrane residues within helix 3 are accessible to the external aqueous solvent, transport activity was measured after incubation in the presence of the membrane-impermeant sulfhydryl-specific reagent, pCMBS (Fig. 3). The activity of M96C was too low to permit this analysis. We previously demonstrated that pCMBS can at least partially enter the glucose permeation pathway of Glut1 and has close access to the exofacial sugar-binding site (24Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 presents the transport activities observed in the presence of pCMBS normalized for each mutant to the activity measured in the absence of the reagent, i.e. a value of 1 indicates no effect of pCMBS, values greater than 1 indicate stimulation by pCMBS, and values less than 1 indicate inhibition by pCMBS. The activity of only one single-C mutant, G111C, was significantly inhibited after incubation with pCMBS, and the observed inhibition was modest in magnitude (∼20%). The V165C mutant represents a well characterized positive control for reaction with and inhibition by pCMBS (12Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10923-10926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30141-30146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The results of the pCMBS inhibition experiments suggest that only one of the helix 3 residues is accessible to the external aqueous solvent (see Fig. 4). This result is in striking contrast to the results obtained for helices 1 (10Heinze M. Monden I. Keller K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 931-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), 2 (11Olsowski A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9367-9372Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), all of which possess four or more pCMBS-reactive residues that lie in direct contact with the external aqueous solvent. All of the pCMBS-reactive residues fall within the predicted exoplasmic half of each helix, consistent with the notion that the eight inner helices of Glut1 tilt in the plane of the membrane in such a way as to form a cavity containing the exoplasmic substrate-binding site near the center of the bilayer analogous to the cytoplasmic substrate-binding sites identified in the lactose permease (17Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar) and glycerol-3-P antiporter (18Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The relative lack of pCMBS sensitivity in the helix 3 residues is consistent with our current structural model, in which this helix is one of four transmembrane helices that surround the inner cavity-forming bundle of eight helices (see Fig. 5). The single residue within helix 3 that was observed to react with pCMBS, glycine 111, is predicted to lie a distance of roughly one-third the length of the helix from the exoplasmic face of the membrane. The accessibility of this residue to a membrane-impermeant reagent indicates that at least a small portion of this outer helix is exposed to the aqueous solvent in the exofacial orientation of the transporter. Presumably a small crevice exists between inner helices 2 and 4 or helices 1 and 4 that permits access of solvent to glycine 111. Based on homology modeling of the cytoplasmic-facing orientation of the transporter, such a crevice is predicted to exist between helices 2 and 4 (see Fig. 5a in Ref. 14Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J.

This is one of the largest effects observed on normalized transport activity of any Glut1 point mutant analyzed to date, suggesting that this residue plays a critical role in the structure and function of the molecule. Methionine 96 is predicted to lie very close to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and given the predicted orientation of helix 3 as an outer helix, this residue is not likely to play a direct role in substrate binding in either conformation of the transporter. Because methionine has a low probability of participating in reverse turns, it is also unlikely that this residue plays a role in forming the hinge region between helices 2 and 3. Furthermore, if methionine 96 were to lie in direct contact with lipid, it is unlikely that a cysteine substitution at this position would have a dramatic impact on transport activity. Therefore, it is most likely that methionine 96 lies in direct apposition to an adjacent inner helix, where it may interact with an apposing residue or residues and is perhaps involved in helical movements involved in the transport cycle. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that methionine 96 lies on the same face of the helix as glycine 111, which must face the aqueous cavity and thus also lies directly opposite to an adjacent inner helical face. An updated version of a model for the exoplasmic substrate-binding site of Glut1 based on the current data is presented in Fig. 5."
https://openalex.org/W2069720934,"Recently we have shown that the c-<i>myb</i> proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) is degraded in response to Wnt-1 signaling via the pathway involving TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase), HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2), and NLK (Nemo-like kinase). NLK and HIPK2 bind directly to c-Myb, which results in the phosphorylation of c-Myb at multiple sites, followed by its ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. The v-<i>myb</i> gene carried by avian myeloblastosis virus has a transforming capacity, but the c-<i>myb</i> proto-oncogene does not. Here, we report that two characteristics of v-Myb make it relatively resistant to Wnt-1-induced protein degradation. First, HIPK2 binds with a lower affinity to the DNA-binding domain of v-Myb than to that of c-Myb. The mutations of three hydrophobic amino acids on the surface of the DNA-binding domain in v-Myb decrease the affinity to HIPK2. Second, a loss of multiple NLK phosphorylation sites by truncation of the C-terminal region of c-Myb increases its stability. Among 15 putative NLK phosphorylation sites in mouse c-Myb, the phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region are more critical than other sites for Wnt-1-induced protein degradation. The relative resistance of v-Myb to Wnt-1-induced degradation may explain, at least in part, the differential transforming capacity of v-Myb <i>versus</i> c-Myb."

LH, and FSH are glycoprotein heterodimers comprised of a common α subunit non-covalently associated with a hormone-specific β subunit. Structure-function studies of multimeric proteins having noncovalently associated subunits have often been hindered because of mutagenesis-induced defects in subunit association. This is especially an issue for the glycoprotein hormones, since only the heterodimers exert biological activity. Genetically linking the α and β subunits to form single-chain derivatives, in which the assembly step is bypassed, is an excellent approach to expand structure-function studies on these proteins (1Sugahara T. Pixley M.R. Minami S. Perlas E. Ben-Menahem D. Hsueh A.J. Boime I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Narayan P. Wu C. Puett D. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21312-21316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One variation of this model, used to examine the conformational relationships between the ligand and the receptor, was the design of a triple-domain gene chimera encoding the sequence FSHβ-CGβ-α (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). This analog, composed of a single α subunit covalently linked with two tandemly arranged β subunits, displayed high-affinity binding to their respective human receptors (FSH-R and LH/CG-R) and activated adenylate cyclase comparable with the heterodimers. Although this chimera exhibited dual gonadotropin activity, it was unclear, however, if a single molecule possessed both FSH and CG activities or if two distinct stable species in the trimer population were generated, each corresponding to a single activity. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a preadsorption receptor binding protocol in which conditioned medium containing the triple-domain analog was first preincubated with transfected CHO cells expressing either the LH/CG or FSH receptors followed by binding to cells expressing either receptor (Fig. 1). We predicted that if a single molecule exhibits bifunctional activity, regardless of which receptor cell line is used in the initial preincubation, both of the activities in the secondary binding assays would be reduced in parallel (Fig. 1A). Alternatively, if there are two distinct biologically active species, there would be a preferential loss of a single activity following the first incubation (Fig. 1B). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that at least two distinct bioactive populations of chimera are secreted, each corresponding to a single activity, and that the single-chain ligand forms heterodimer-like FSH and CG conformations. Receptor-expressing Cell Lines—CHO cells expressing the rat LH receptor (rLH-R) or the human FSH receptor (hFSH-R) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air as described previously (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing the rat LH receptor rather than homologous human LH/CG receptor were used here due to their higher affinity for CG (5Cosowsky L. Lin W. Han Y. Bernard M.P. Campbell R.K. Moyle W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3309-3314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This would increase the capture efficiency of the analog during preincubation steps. Preparation of Concentrated Analog—The FSHβ-CTP-CGβ-α single chain was previously constructed and expressed in CHO cells (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned media (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) from this mutant was concentrated by Ultrafree centrifugal filter devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Estimates of the concentrations of the two components of the single-chain analog were performed by FSH and CG dimer-specific RIAs according to the manufacturer's instructions (Diagnostics Products Corp.). Each of the two RIAs used is hormonespecific and shows low cross-reactivity (less than 0.1%) to the other glycoprotein. The analog exhibited 2.4 IU of CG for each IU of FSH immunoreactivity detected. Preadsorption to CHO Receptor Cells—The experiments presented here were designed to test whether there is a single form that exerts bifunctional activity or whether there are multiple species each exhibiting a specificity for only a single receptor. The principle of the approach is the ability of receptor-expressing CHO cells to selectively sequester specific populations of gonadotropin activities after incubating a known amount of the chimera with CHO cells expressing either the FSH-R or the rLH-R. As a control, the chimera was also incubated with non-transfected CHO wild type cells. The supernatant recovered after this preadsorption step was used for receptor binding assays in parallel with the other samples. We first determined the optimal conditions in the preadsorption assay to achieve maximal binding and retention of the triple-domain FSHβ-CGβ-α chimera. The criterion used to optimize the system was the difference between the amount of FSH ligand remaining in the recovered sample following the preadsorption step and the amount of immunoreactive FSH added. The optimal protocol included two preadsorption steps performed at 21°, one for 18 h, and then a subsequent 5-h incubation. Based on our preliminary analyses, all the experiments described here were performed as follows. Cells expressing the hFSH-R or rLH-R or non-transfected wild type CHO cells were plated on 24-well plates at 4 × 105 cells per well and grown at 37 °C for 24 h to form monolayer. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml each of cold modified Krebs-Ringer buffer and incubated at 21 °C with media containing different concentrations of purified hCG, recombinant FSH standards, or conditioned medium containing the FSHβ-CTP-CGβ-α analog. After 18 h, the media were recovered and centrifuged to eliminate dead cells, and the supernatant was placed into new plates containing monolayers of hFSH-R, rLH-R, or wild type CHO cells. This second adsorption period was performed for 5 h at 21 °C.The media were centrifuged again, and this supernatant was used for FSH and CG receptor binding assays and Western blot analyses. For each cell type, two to four wells of cells were used per concentration of analog during preadsorption experiments. Receptor Binding Assays—Receptor binding assays were modified from previously described conditions (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of the analog-containing medium recovered after the two adsorption steps described above were incubated for 18 h at 21 °C with 4 × 105 of either rLH or hFSH receptor cells in 300 μl of cold modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 100,000 cpm 125I-hCG or 125I-FSH, respectively. To terminate the binding reaction and to remove unbound isotope, the cells were washed twice with cold modified Krebs-Ringer buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. A γ-counter was used to determine the radioactivity bound to the cell pellet, and for each sample, two to four duplicates were assayed and at least three repetitions of the binding assays were performed. Each supernatant collected after the preadsorption sequence was used for both LH and FSH receptor binding assays. We refer to this second receptor binding step as a secondary assay. Western Blot Analysis—Single-chain gonadotropin mutants in concentrated conditioned media were quantitated by both FSH and LH dimer-specific RIAs according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of analogs were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE in the absence of heat and reducing agent and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Proteins were probed with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) FSH dimer-specific (FSH54), FSHβ-specific, and CG dimer-specific (B109) and with CGβ polyclonal antiserum. Immunodetection was performed with Tropix chemiluminescent system (Tropix, Bedford, MA). The FSH mAbs were obtained from Organon Bv (Oss, The Netherlands) and B109 mAb from Dr. Steven Birken at Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons. The CG polyclonal antiserum was prepared in this laboratory. To examine whether dimer-like populations detected in conditioned medium containing the chimera are stable at room temperature, a time course experiment was performed, followed by Western blot analysis. To obtain optimal signal on blots, the conditioned medium was diluted in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer. One ml of this medium was incubated at room temperature under conditions similar to those used for the prebinding receptor incubations. Duplicate aliquots were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 h and after 18 h of incubation. Samples were frozen until Western blot analysis using CG and FSH dimer-specific mAbs. This experiment was performed three times. Receptor Binding Experiments with Purified Recombinant FSH and hCG Standards—We tested the validity of the preadsorption protocol to fractionate a mixture of distinct gonadotropin activities using human recombinant FSH (rFSH) and urinary CG (CG) heterodimers. Accordingly, 300 mIU of human rFSH, CG, or a combination of both were preincubated with FSH receptor cells, rLH receptor cells, or CHO wild type cells under the conditions described above. (The rFSH and CG inputs were previously determined to give, respectively, 60 and 40% displacement of bound 125I tracer from their cognate receptor cells in standard binding assays.) Both FSH and CG binding assays were performed on samples obtained after the two-step preadsorption incubation (Fig. 2). As discussed under “Experimental Procedures,” for each sample the secondary receptor binding activity measured in the medium will vary depending on the amount of hormone that is retained in the preadsorption step. Fig. 2A illustrates the secondary CG test assays following preadsorption with either the LH receptor (closed bars) or wild type (open bars) cells of heterodimeric FSH or CG standards, and the mixture. As expected, no binding activity was detected when the preincubated FSH standard was tested in the secondary assay with the LH receptor cells or the wild type CHO cells as evident by the lack of competition for bound 125I-hCG. However, when the CG standard was preincubated with LH receptor cells and untransfected cells, there was a 35% difference in the amount of displaceable 125I-CG bound between the samples obtained from the preincubation with wild type and LH-R cells. This difference reflects that essentially all of the CG was sequestered by LH-R cells, while the untransfected cells did not bind CG, reflected by the observed 125I displacement. When FSH and CG standards were mixed, a comparable difference was obtained, indicating that the presence of hFSH did not interfere with the binding of the hCG to its receptor during the preadsorption step. A reciprocal FSH receptor binding experiment was performed in which the above samples were incubated with FSH receptor (open bars) or wild type (closed bars) cells (Fig. 2B). The FSH standard recovered after binding with wild type cells displaced 60% of 125I-FSH in the test assay, but there was only a 20% displacement in bound 125I following preincubation with FSH-R cells. This shows that the amount of available FSH after the initial incubation was reduced by 40% due to the sequestration of hormone by the FSH-R cells during preadsorption. Significantly, similar differences between receptor cells and control wild type cells were obtained when the FSH standard was mixed with the hCG standard. Finally, there was no detectable loss of CG activity, i.e. there was no binding of CG standard to the FSH receptors following the preadsorption step. Using both hCG and hFSH standards, these data indicate that the two-step preadsorption protocol represents a stable assay and a feasible approach to fractionate a potential mixture of FSH and CG bioactive species generated during synthesis of the triple-domain chimera. Preadsorption of the Chimera with Receptor-expressing Cells—Having demonstrated that preadsorbing either purified hFSH or hCG to the FSH-R or rLH-R cells effectively alters the extent of binding of the cognate ligand recovered after preincubation, we examined the preadsorption of the triple-domain analog in the two-step assay. Previously we demonstrated that the FSHβ-CGβ-α chimera bound to the FSH and LH receptors with affinities comparable with the corresponding heterodimers (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed above, if the analog is a single bifunctional entity, loss of one activity should be paralleled by loss of the other. Alternatively, if two mutually exclusive biologically active populations are present, each hormonal activity should be independent from the other. Several concentrations of the chimera were preadsorbed in parallel to three sets of cells: LH-R, FSH-R, and CHO-wt (Fig. 3). Both CG and FSH binding affinities remaining in the supernatants were determined in the secondary binding assay using LH-R (A) and FSH-R cells (B). As expected, the secondary CG receptor binding assay showed much lower binding activity in the supernatant after preadsorption of the chimera to the LH-R cells compared with the supernatant following incubation with control CHO-wt cells (initial binding activity) (Fig. 3A). The supernatant obtained from the samples containing the two lower concentrations of analog tested (42 and 125 mIU/ml of FSH) lacked binding activity, i.e. no noticeable displacement of 125I was observed. These data suggest that at these concentrations, nearly all the active CG activity initially present in the conditioned media was sequestered by the LH receptors during the preadsorption steps. Moreover, when identical concentrations of analog were preadsorbed to FSH-R cells, there was no difference in the CG binding activity compared with the supernatant following incubation with control CHO wild type cells. These data indicate quantitative binding of CG by the rLH-R during the preadsorption steps. The data also show that there was no coordinate loss of both CG and FSH activities, which implies the presence of at least two independent entities. The same concentrations of the triple-domain analog used in Fig. 3A were preadsorbed in parallel to the three sets of cells as described above, but now the binding activities were determined in the secondary assay with FSH-R cells (Fig. 3B). Only the sample exposed to the FSH-R cells during preadsorption displayed lower binding compared with wild type cells. In this case, values of nearly 100% of the standard 125I-FSH bound in the secondary assay were obtained after preadsorbing to FSH-R cells for concentrations up to 175 mIU/ml of FSH, indicating no competing FSH activity in the post-adsorption supernatant. Moreover, the FSH-R binding activity in the supernatant determined after preadsorption to rLH-R cells is comparable with the supernatant obtained after preadsorption to CHO-wt cells. These results show that FSH binding activity is quantitatively retained by the FSH-R during the adsorption steps, and there was no apparent coupled decrease in CG activity. Taken together, our data show that when one of the two hormonal binding activities of the chimera is eliminated by preadsorption to its receptors, the binding activity of the other component remains relatively unaffected. These results suggest that at least two distinct bioactive populations of the analogs are secreted in the conditioned medium, which exhibit either CG or FSH binding activity. Western Blot Analysis of Chimera—Although the above receptor binding data demonstrate the presence of at least two distinct biologically active species, their configuration and structural stability are not clear. Do these two bioactive populations form heterodimer-like interactions or do they exist in an exclusively relaxed non-dimeric conformation? To address this question, we examined the immunoreactivity of the chimera on Western blots using dimer-specific monoclonal antibodies. That these mAbs were specific for heterodimers is shown in Fig. 4. The FSH-specific mAb detects only recombinant FSH dimers (A, lanes 1 and 2) but not the non-combined secreted FSHβ subunit (lane 3), whereas in the case of the CG dimer-specific mAb, only the CG heterodimer (B, lanes 1 and 2) and not the free subunit (lane 3) is immunoreactive. These antibodies also do not recognize the common α subunit (6Moyle W.R. Matzuk M.M. Campbell R.K. Cogliani E. Dean-Emig D.M. Krichevsky A. Barnet R.W. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8511-8518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2V. Garcia-Campayo, A. Jablonka-Shariff, and I. Boime, unpublished observations. By contrast, an mAb that recognizes epitopes in the FSHβ subunit reacts with both the heterodimer (A, lanes 4 and 5) and free subunit (lane 6). CG polyclonal antiserum (B) detects both the heterodimer (lanes 4 and 5) and free subunit (lane 6). Thus, these mAbs should distinguish chimeric forms bearing FSHβ/CGβ heterodimeric contacts from those in which the β subunit is in a non-assembled configuration. If the chimera lacks α-β heterodimeric contacts, no signals should be observed with dimerspecific mAbs. It is clear that both FSH and CG dimer-specific mAbs detect the chimera (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 1) and their respective native heterodimers (Fig. 5, A and B, lane 2). As expected, no signals were detected when the corresponding uncombined FSHβ and CGβ subunits were probed with the dimer-specific mAbs (lane 3) even after prolonged exposure of the blot (data not shown). These results corroborate the above findings that at least two bioactive species are generated during the synthesis of the triple-domain chimera, and they are configured with intramolecular heterodimer-like interactions.Fig. 5Detection of the triple-domain chimera with FSH (A) and CG (B) dimer-specific mAbs. The triple-domain single chain (A and B, lane 1) migrates as a 60–70-kDa form and is recognized by both FSH and CG dimer-specific mAbs. Slower migratory species corresponding to greater than 100 kDa were seen in the chimera, and although the nature of these proteins is not clear, such aggregates are seen in the purification of native CG. The dimers shown in lane 2 of A and B correspond to recombinant heterodimers synthesized in our CHO cell lines. Non-combined rFSHβ and rCGβ subunits are not recognized by dimer-specific mAbs (arrows; A and B, lane 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) That these mAbs react with the heterodimer-like forms of the triple-domain chimera provides an independent approach to verify our preadsorption model. Using the same preincubation protocol described for Fig. 3, 300 mIU/ml of chimera were incubated with CHO-wt cells, FSH-R cells, and LH-R cells. The quantity of chimera used here is based on the amount that gave sufficient displacement in the binding studies but at an adequate concentration to yield a signal that is quantifiable on the Western blots. Following the preadsorption to the cells, the supernatants were electrophoresed and the blots probed with the two mAbs. Each cell type was run in duplicate on the blot (Fig. 6). Immunodetection with FSH dimer-specific mAb (A) shows that the FSH dimer-like population of the trimer following preadsorption to rLH-R cells (lanes 3 and 4) remains constant relative to the detection obtained after preadsorption to control CHO-wt cells (lanes 1 and 2). However, the FSH dimer-like population is specifically reduced 3–4-fold when the chimera is preadsorbed to FSH-R cells (lanes 5 and 6). The reciprocal data were seen when the chimera was immunodetected with CG dimer specific mAb (B). The CG dimer-like population of the trimer decreases 3-fold following preadsorption to rLH-R cells (lanes 3 and 4) relative to the detection after preadsorption to either control CHO-wt cells (lanes 1 and 2) or FSH-R cells (lanes 5 and 6). The data show the presence of two distinct populations, each sequestered by a specific receptor, and thus support the receptor binding experiments that the chimera is comprised of at least two distinct biologically active populations. One question that arises from these results is whether or not these dimer-like populations detected in the media are stable or if there are transient changes in the proportions of the secreted dimer-like FSH/CG conformers. To examine this issue, aliquots of conditioned medium containing the chimera were incubated with CHO cells at room temperature under conditions identical to those described above for the prebinding incubations (see “Experimental Procedures”). The samples were taken at various time points and probed with CG/FSH dimer-specific mAbs (Fig. 7). It is evident that throughout the time course, there were no marked changes in the signals up to 18 h of incubation. Moreover, there was no preferential shift to one species at the expense of the other. These data suggest that at least for the secreted forms, there is no marked interchange between CG and FSH complexes and the secreted forms are in a stable configuration. Previously we demonstrated that single-chain chimeras of the glycoprotein hormone family bearing either two or three tandemly arranged β subunits genetically linked to a single α subunit displayed multiple bioactivities (4Kanda M. Jablonka-Shariff A. Sato A. Pixley M.R. Bos E. Hiro'oka T. Ben-Menahem D. Boime I. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1873-1881PubMed Google Scholar, 7Garcia-Campayo V. Kumar T.R. Boime I. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3773-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). While it was evident that a single protein manifested these activities (two in the case of FSHβ-CGβ-α chimera or three for the TSH-FSHβ-CGβ-α analog), it was not clear if one form exhibited the multiple functions, or if each activity could be attributed to different populations of molecules, each possessing a single hormonal activity. To address this question, the biological activities encoded in the FSHβ-CGβ-α chimera were fractionated by preincubating conditioned media containing the analog with CHO cells expressing either the FSH or LH receptor. Using two independent approaches, we show here that at least two functional entities are generated during the synthesis of the chimera, each corresponding to either a FSH or LH/CG binding activity. These data represent the first indication that the single-chain glycoprotein hormone analogs are secreted as functionally distinct populations. Previously, we demonstrated that significant changes in the quaternary structure of the hormone dimers or single chains comprised of mutated α and β subunits did not impair the in vitro biological activity of such analogs (8Jackson A.M.

These observations were compatible with the idea that a population of only a single form would manifest dual activity, since presumably it would not configure into a complete heterodimeric structure. In such a model, a specific receptor orients the appropriate α/β domains into the respective biologically active species (11Wang Y. Bernard M.P. Moyle W.R. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, based on this study, we would have expected a coordinate loss of both FSH and CG activities, since preincubation with either the FSH-R or LH-R protein would have sequestered the unique dually active single form. Our results show that the FSH and CG activities of the single-chain triple-domain chimera are independent and thus argue against synthesis of only a single bioactive class of molecules. Moreover, because these bulky single-chain variants, relative to the native heterodimer, are bioactive, this implies flexibility in the ligand-receptor interaction and that this conformational plasticity may account for their binding to their cognate receptors via the common α subunit. The ability for two intrachain β subunits to interact with one α subunit and display two different biologically active conformations has important physiological implications. It is well established that both FSH and LH are made in the same cell, i.e. in the gonadotroph, and yet exhibit differences in the rates of assembly of their corresponding subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is, however, unclear how in the ER the β subunits sort out from each other and assemble with a common α subunit. Our data provide an explanation for this specificity. Once the α-β contacts are formed, the resultant species are stable, since the forms analyzed here are secretory products that accumulate in the media. This implies that there is little interchange between the native heterodimers during synthesis or between the heterodimer-like forms of the triple-domain chimera. This conclusion is supported by our data that there is no significant shift between the extracellular chimeric heterodimer-like forms of CG/FSH during prolonged incubation. Moreover, in previous studies (12Ben-Menahem D. Hyde R. Pixley M. Berger P. Boime I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15070-15077Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) it was shown that when a single-chain double-domain construct (e.g. CGβ-α) is co-transfected with the gene encoding the FSHβ subunit, or when the gene encoding the FSHβ-α single chain is co-transfected with the CGβ subunit, analyses of the products by dimer-specific mAbs revealed no single complex contained both FSH and CG dimer-specific epitopes. This suggested that those intracellular complexes did not exhibit simultaneous FSH and CG heterodimer-like conformations. There have been several reports that the ER is comprised of a mosaic of specialized subdomains (13Sitia R. Meldolesi J. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1711-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These subcompartments have distinct functions and have a different distribution of resident proteins. Thus, one explanation for the formation of FSH/LH heterodimers in the gonadotrope is that each hormone is assembled at a distinct sub-ER compartment. Our in vitro experiments indicate that the α subunit of the chimera primarily interacts with only a single β subunit. This would explain why in vivo a three-subunit complex comprised of LHβ, FSHβ, and a single α subunit is not observed in the gonadotrope. The absence of stable triple-domain, dually active gonadotropins in vivo ensures the coordinate events of endocrine homeostasis by the circulating monofunctional heterodimers required for distinct physiological responses. The model system described here may have wider applicability. Given the availability of cell lines expressing the numerous high-affinity receptors and their corresponding solubilized forms, design of experimental systems comparable with those described here can be performed for identifying other proteins that exhibit multiple activities via activation of different receptors.

One important mechanism by which RARβ2 can exert growth inhibitory function is based on its ability to repress the AP-1 transcription factor in a ligand-dependent manner. Because less is known about the biological effects of RARβ in the absence of ligand, the corresponding cDNA was stably introduced into HPV18-positive HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. In the present study we describe a novel mechanism by which AP-1 becomes inactivated. Constitutive expression of nonliganded RARβ abrogated both AP-1 binding affinity and activity by a selective degradation of the c-Jun protein as major dimerization partner, without substitution by other members of the Jun family. Blockage of the proteasomal pathway completely rescued c-Jun and reconstituted the AP-1 function. Moreover, HeLa RARβ2 clones treated either with tumor necrosis factor-α or transfected with a constitutive active upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEKK1Δ) also resulted in c-Jun phosphorylation and restoration of AP-1 affinity and functionality similar to that found in nontransfected parental HeLa cells. These data revealed an important cross-talk between trans-repression of AP-1 and nonliganded RARβ in human papillomavirus-positive cells. Because AP-1 activity was not irreversibly disturbed, but could be switched on through activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, a model for the transient activation of AP-1 even in the presence of RARβ as repressor is suggested."
