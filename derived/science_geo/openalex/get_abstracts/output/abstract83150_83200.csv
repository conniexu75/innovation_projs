https://openalex.org/W1981768909,"In vitro genetic techniques were used to study the sequence requirements for the initiation of specific transcription. Deletion mutants were constructed around the putative promoter of the adenovirus-2 major late and chicken conalbumin genes. Specific transcription in vitro by RNA polymerase B together with a HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract was used as the test for promoter function. With this approach sequences which are essential for the initiation of specific transcription in vitro, were shown to be located between 12 and 32 base pairs upstream from the 5' end of these genes."

Long-term, but not short-term, antidepressant treatment decreases the numbers of both serotonin and beta-adrenergic receptors. The decrease in the number of receptor sites is most marked for [3H]spiroperidol-labeled serotonin receptors and is characteristic for antidepressants of several classes."

Moreover, the physiological defect in purine nucleotide synthesis characteristic of human Lesch-Nyhan cells can be overcome by the introduction of the bacterial gene into these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2080844332,"Photosynthesis of previtamin D3 can occur throughout the epidermis in the dermis when hypopigmented Caucasian skin is exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation. Once previtamin D3 is formed in the skin, it undergoes a temperature-dependent thermal isomerization that takes at least 3 days to complete. The vitamin D-binding protein preferentially translocates the thermal product, vitamin D3, into the circulation. These processes suggest a unique mechanism for the synthesis, storage, and slow, steady release of vitamin D3 from the skin into the circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2056770304,"All cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus contain levels of phosphotyrosine in protein which are 6–10 fold greater than the very low levels present in uninfected cells. The increase is due largely to modification of cellular polypeptides. The abundance of phosphorylated tyrosines in protein in cells infected with tsLA29, a mutant of Rous sarcoma virus which is temperature-sensitive for cellular transformation, increases to 60% of maximum within 60 min of a shift to the permissive temperature and drops to a level close to that in uninfected cells within 60 min of a shift to the restrictive temperature. In light of the fact that pp60src phosphorylates tyrosine in vitro, these results suggest strongly that the modification of one or more cellular polypeptides by way of pp60src is critical for cellular transformation by Rous sarcoma virus. There is, however, no increase in the abundance of phosphotyrosine in protein in mouse cells transformed by Kirsten sarcoma virus, Moloney sarcoma virus, or SV40 virus, in chick embryo cells infected with avian myelocytomatosis virus MC29, and in rat and hamster cells transformed by polyoma virus. Thus increased phosphorylation of tyrosine is neither a universal mechanism of transformation nor an inevitable secondary cellular response to transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1988178079,"The calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb (1973) is an efficent means of introducing DNA into culturaed animal cells. Cells which incorporate one selectable marker are also likely to incorporate one selectable marker are also likely to incorporate sequences from the carrier DNA. Both selected and unselected markers are found integrated in the high molecular weight nuclear DNA of the host. In the present study, we demonstrate that exogenously acquired sequences are gentically linked, segregating and amplifying coordinately, and that their flanking sequences derive primarily from the carrier species rather than the host species. Based on these results, we propose that, upon transformation, the host cell ligates incorporated DNA into a large concatameric structure which may at times be as large as 2000 kilobases. From blotting data alone we cannot determine whether this structure is chromosomal or extrachromosomal in location."
https://openalex.org/W1591250963,"Abstract The mitochondrial genomes of cytoplasmic petite (rho-) mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been used to sequence the cytochrome b gene. A continuous sequence of 6.2 kilobase pairs has been obtained from 71.4 to 80.2 units of the wild type map. This region contains all the cytochrome b mutations previously assigned to the cob1 and cob2 genetic loci. Analysis of the DNA sequence has revealed that in the strain D273-10B, the cytochrome b gene is composed of three exons. The longest exon (b1) codes for the first 252 to 253 amino acids from the NH2-terminal end of the protein. The next two exons (b2 and b3) code for 16 to 18 and 115 to 116 amino acids, respectively. The complete cytochrome b polypeptide chain consists of 385 amino acids. Based on the amino acid composition, the yeast protein has a molecular weight of 44,000. The three exon regions of the cytochrome b gene are separated by two introns. The intron between b1 and b2 is 1414 nucleotides long and contains a reading frame that is continuous with the reading frame of exon b1. This intron sequence is potentially capable of coding for another protein of 384 amino acid residues. The second intron is 733 nucleotides long. This sequence is rich in A + T and includes a G + C cluster that may be involved in processing of the cytochrome b messenger. The organization of the cytochrome b region in S. cerevisiae D273-10B is somewhat less complex than has been reported for other yeast strains i which exon b1 appears to be further fragmented into three smaller exons."
https://openalex.org/W1980966767,"Mutants of animal viruses can be isolated in bacteria by recombinant DNA methods. Since no viral functions are required for propagation of recombinants in bacteria, viral mutants with lethal changes in cis- or trans-acting elements can be isolated, as well as partially or conditionally defective mutants. In the cases of viruses with small DNA genomes, such as the tumorigenic simian virus 40 (SV40), the entire viral DNA can be inserted into the bacterial plasmid pBR322 and cloned in Escherichia coli. Recombinant plasmids with a single copy of SV40 DNA cause morphological transformation of mouse cells in culture with the same efficiency as SV40 DNA isolated from virus-infected monkey cells, but the recombinant DNA is noninfectious and replicates poorly in permissive cells. However, SV40 DNA excised from the plasmid replicates as well as authentic viral DNA and is fully infectious. SV40 mutants with small deletions or base substitutions have been isolated by in vitro site-specific or random local mutagenesis of recombinant DNA followed by cloning in E. coli. Many of the mutants thus isolated are defective in specific viral functions."
https://openalex.org/W2058655704,"Crown gall tumors are induced in plants by infection with the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Because the tumor induction involves transfer of a portion of the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid DNA from the bacterium to the plant cells, this system is of interest for the study of genetic exchange as well as tumor induction. The boundaries of the transferred DNA (T-DNA) have been cloned from transformed plant cells of tobacco. Detailed mapping with restriction enzymes and nucleotide sequence analysis of two independent clones were used to study the molecular structure of the ends of the T-DNA. One clone contains the two ends of the T-DNA joined together; the other contains one end of the T-DNA joined to repetitive plant DNA sequences. These studies provide direct evidence that the T-DNA can be integrated into the plant genome. In addition, the data suggest that in the plant, T-DNA can be tandemly repeated. Sequence analysis of the junction of crown gall clone 1 reveals several direct repeats as well as an inverted repeat; these structures may be involved in the transfer of the DNA from Agrobacterium to plant cells."

https://openalex.org/W1558104881,"beta-Hexosaminidase B purified from human fibroblast secretions was used as a ligand to study phosphomannosyl-enzyme receptors in membranes from rat tissues. Enzyme binding to rat liver membranes was saturable, competitively inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate, not dependent on calcium, and destroyed by prior treatment of the hexosaminidase with either alkaline phosphatase or endoglycosidase H. Most (90%) of the phosphomannosyl-enzyme receptors were found in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes; 9.5% in the plasma membrane, and less than 1% in nuclei and mitochondria. Receptors were vesicle-enclosed in all fractions except plasma membrane. Receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum apparently were occupied by endogenous ligands, but most receptors in lysosomes and plasma membrane were unoccupied. Most of the endogenous beta-hexosaminidase was in lysosomes and was released from vesicles by detergent treatment. Displacement of the residual receptor-bound endogenous beta-hexosaminidase (mostly in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus) from detergent-treated membranes by mannose 6-phosphate released high uptake enzyme with properties expected for phosphomannosyl-enzymes. Mannose 6-phosphate-inhibitable enzyme receptor activity was found in nine rat organs and correlated roughly with their lysosomal enzyme content. These data support a general model for lysosomal enzyme transport in which the phosphomannosyl-enzyme receptor acts as a vehicle for delivery of newly synthesized acid hydrolases from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2059886705,"Two unstable mutations at the his4 locus of yeast are due to the insertion of the transposable elements Ty912 and Ty917 into the his4 regulatory region. The two transposons are related, one being derived from the other by a substitution of 4000 base pairs of DNA. Element Ty912 includes identical terminal repeats, whereas the terminal repeats of Ty917 are not identical. Transposition of Ty912 or Ty917 generates 5-base-pair duplications of the target DNA at either end of the element. Expression and reversion of a his4 gene containing Ty912 or Ty917 is controlled by three unlinked regulatory genes. The properties of these regulatory genes are similar to those described for the controlling elements in maize."
https://openalex.org/W2164382548,"A 660 nucleotide adenovirus-associated virus type 2 (AAV2) DNA fragment which encodes the 5' terminal leader and the entire intervening sequence of the major viral mRNA has been cloned into pBR322, and its primary sequence has been determined. The 5' terminal viral mRNA sequence was deduced by sequencing the reverse-transcriptase cDNA extension product of a 5' end-labeled DNA primer complementary to the RNA 5' terminal region. From combined DNA and RNA sequence analyses (which confirm our previous mapping data) we conclude that the major AAV2 transcript contains a 5' terminal leader sequence about 55 nucleotides in length encoded from a continuous region of DNA (near position 39 on the viral genome) 320 bases from the RNA body. The DNA sequences of the splice junctions are similar to those found for other class II genes. No other nucleotide sequence, indicative of promotion at another (upstream) site, is present at the 5' terminus. The DNA region encoding and flanking the leader sequence displays structural features expected for a class II gene promoter, including the canonical ATATAA sequence 23-25 bases upstream from the presumed initiation site. When the cloned viral DNA fragment is transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase II in a cell-free system, a transcript is produced with a 5' end that is similar or identical to that found on the in vivo mRNA. Taken together these data strongly suggest that the major polysomal RNA may be generated from a transcription unit with a promoter at position 39, even though this transcription unit is part of a larger transcription unit with an upstream promoter near position 6. This indication of overlapping transcription units with independent promoters provides a major new insight into parvovirus gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2027690720,"We have developed a technique for the insertion of any DNA fragment into the herpes simplex virus (HSV) genome at specific sites. This technique was used to resolve a specific problem concerning the isomerization of the HSV genome. Briefly, HSV DNA consists of four isomers differing in the orientation of two covalently linked components, L and S, relative to each other. Each component consists of unique sequences flanked by inverted repeats. To determine whether the isomerization of HSV DNA is the result of generalized recombination between homologous reiterated sequences in the inverted repeats or the result of site-specific recombination, we constructed plasmids in which DNA fragments derived from various regions of the viral genome were inserted in both orientations into the thymidine kinase gene, rendering it nonfunctional. The HSV DNA sequences in the plasmids were then recombined into the viral genome, and viral recombinants were selected for their thymidine kinase-deficient phenotype. The insertion of these fragments by homologous recombination was highly efficient in that all the viral clones isolated contained the inserted fragment at the expected location. The only fragments that promoted additional inversions of the viral genome were those spanning the junction between the L and S components. Furthermore, analysis of isomers formed by these recombinants indicates that the inversions occur only when sequences in the inserted fragment are in inverted orientation in relation to homologous sequences at the termini or at the authentic junction."
https://openalex.org/W2007597359,"Abstract Abrin A chain, alpha-sarcin, mitogillin, restrictocin and Phytolacca americana protein (PAP) all effectively inhibited protein synthesis in picornavirus-infected cells, although with different activities. The most powerful inhibitor was alpha-sarcin; 0.1 μM caused over 90% inhibition in virus-infected cells, whereas no inhibition of translation was observed in uninfected cells even at concentrations of 40 μM alpha-sarcin. Inhibition depended on the multiplicity of infection and concentration of toxin. Although the blockade of protein synthesis by alpha-sarcin was maximal when the toxin was added simultaneously with the virus, a drastic inhibition was also observed if this addition was made after virus entry, suggesting that the toxin passes into the cell once membrane permeability has been modified by viral infection. Inhibitors of transcription and translation did not suppress the entry of alpha-sarcin into the cell. This could indicate that a virion component is involved in the permeabilization of the cell to the toxin. However, heat-inactivated virions did not promote the permeabilization of the cell to alpha-sarcin. Our efforts to detect a toxin-virus complex were unsuccessful. Similar results were obtained with HeLa cells infected by adenovirus type 5 and with BHK cells infected by Semliki Forest virus."
https://openalex.org/W2056649927,Phase variation in bacteria is regulated by homologous recombination at a specific DNA site. This recombinational event causes the inversion of a 970-base-pair DNA sequence that includes the promoter necessary for transcription of a flagellar gene. The invertible segment is flanked by two sites that are necessary for the inversion and contains a gene (hin) whose product mediates the inversion event. The hin gene shows extensive homology with the TnpR gene carried on the Tn3 transposon. It is also homologous with the gin gene carried on bacteriophage mu. These relationships suggest that the phase variation system may have evolved by the association of a transposon with a resident gene and the subsequent specialization of these elements to regulate flagellar antigen expression.
https://openalex.org/W2088195434,"We report characteristics of himA mutations of E. coli, selected for their inability to support the site-specific recombination reaction involved in the formation of lysogens by bacteriophage lambda. The himA allele lies at minute 38 on the chromosome. Three noncomplementing and closely linked mutations define the himA locus; one is a nonsense mutation which shows that the gene product is a protein. HimA mutations reduce both lambda integrative and excisive site-specific recombination. Since dominance tests demonstrate that himA mutations are recessive, it is probable that the himA protein is either a necessary component for site-specific recombination or, alternatively, regulates the expression of such a function. HimA mutations exhibit pleiotropic effects. They reduce integration of phages that have different attachment specificities from lambda and inhibit the growth of phage mu. In addition, himA mutations reduce precise excision of integrated phage mu as well as Tn elements. This pleiotropy suggests that the role of himA protein is nonspecific. Since all of the processes affected by himA mutations ultimately rely on protein-DNA interactions, we suggest that himA protein may act in an auxillary manner to facilitate these interactions."

https://openalex.org/W1481499718,"The manner in which islet-activating protein (IAP), a protein purified from the culture medium of Bordetella pertussis, interacts with the islet B-cell was studied by following the progressive development of IAP-induced reversal of alpha-adrenergic inhibition of insulin release during maintenance of islets in culture with glucose and epinephrine. This action of IAP developed in an exponential manner dependent on its concentration after a true lag period of about 1 h. The lag period was not grossly dependent on the concentration of IAP added but highly dependent on temperature of culture, and was still seen upon adding a second dose of IAP to partially stimulated cells. After 24-h culture significantly more insulin was secreted with IAP at a concentration as low as 1 pg/ml and the half-maximal effect was observed at 0.1 ng/ml. The development of IAP action occurred even in the islets that had been exposed to IAP for only 30 s, but was significantly prevented by anti-IAP serum added before the end of the lag period. IAP was effective in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or of vinblastine or cytochalasin B, microtubular-microfilamentous modifiers. It is suggested that the IAP molecule is rapidly bound to the receptor area of the islet B-cell and then is gradually inserted into the cell membrane before appearance of its action to activate native calcium ionophores. This slow interaction of IAP with the membrane may be responsible for potentiation of insulin secretory and cAMP responses of the cell to various stimuli as well as for reversal of alpha-adrenergic inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1531120019,"Human neutrophils exposed to the soluble stimulus, phorbol myristate acetate, generate a flux of O2.- which can destroy human erythrocyte targets. Under optimal conditions, each neutrophil was capable of lysing almost 10 erythrocyte targets. Hemolysis was inhibited by exogenous copper-zinc or iron superoxide dismutase while neither heat-denatured enzyme nor albumin inhibited cytotoxicity. Although neutrophils can also generate H2O2, neither catalase nor a glutathione-glutathione peroxidase system inhibited hemolysis. Hemolysis was prevented by conversion of the hemoglobin to carbon monoxyhemoglobin, suggesting an intracellular mechanism of cytotoxicity. Conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin by nitrite treatment did not impair neutrophil-mediated hemolysis. However, nitrite-treated targets were not protected by superoxide dismutase, while exogenous catalase inhibited cytotoxicity, suggesting a potential role for H2O2 and methemoglobin. H2O2 and methemoglobin are known to interact to form an oxidant complex whose cytotoxic potential was underlined by the marked sensitivity of nitrite-treated cells to commercial H2O2. It is proposed that neutrophil-derived O2.- oxidizes oxyhemoglobin to generate methemoglobin and H2O2 which interact to form a cytotoxic complex capable of hemolyzing the erythrocyte target."
https://openalex.org/W1998305786,"Nuclear matrix prepared from mouse 3T6 cells lytically infected with polyoma virus retained significant amounts of the 100K T antigen and intact viral genomes. Bound T antigen was resistant to the extraction by high salt (2 M NaCI), detergent (1% Triton X-100) and exhaustive DNAase treatment. Only conditions sufficient to disrupt the integrity of the matrix itself solubilized the matrix T antigen. During the time period of 16–30 hr after infection, both the accumulation (in μg) and the incorporation of 35S-methionine into T antigen increased steadily in cell extracts to a peak at 26 hr and then declined. In contrast, the amount of labeled T antigen retained by the matrix was relatively constant over the same time period. Matrix-bound T antigen was more highly phosphorylated and newly synthesized compared with the extractable T antigen. Viral DNA steadily accumulates in nuclei and on the matrix from 18 to 30 hr after infection. The fraction of viral DNA retained by the matrix was greatest early in infection (25% at 16 hr), declining to less than 10% by 24 hr. These data are consistent with the existence of a fixed (and limited) number of sites for T antigen (more highly phosphorylated) on the matrix and implicate the nuclear matrix as a site of viral DNA replication and possibly encapsidation."
https://openalex.org/W2029634169,"The nucleotide sequence of the transforming Hind III-G fragment of Ad12 DNA which encompasses the left 6.8% of the genome has been determined. The fragment was 2320 nucleotides long, and contained a GC cluster at positions 126–155 and a region extremely rich in AT at positions 1098–1142 (number from the leftmost end). Possible coding regions for the two transforming gene products were assigned. The predicted coding region for T antigen g is positions 502–1069 and positions 1144–1373, which are joined by splicing (266 amino acid residues, 30 kd), and that for T antigen f is positions 1845–2126 (94 amino acids residues, 10 kd). The sequence of the Hind III-G fragment was compared with that of the transforming DNA fragment of Ad5 which encompasses the left 8.0% of the genome (2809 nucleotides). There are several discrete regions with significant sequence homology. The comparison suggests that the regions in the left two thirds of the Ad5 and Ad12 transforming DNA fragments (map units 0–4.7% in Ad5 and 0–4.4% in Ad12) bear some resemblance in their gene organizations, and code for proteins containing structurally homologous regions."
https://openalex.org/W1980593797,"DNA carrying inverted repeats was tested for transposition within the Drosophila genome. Five Bam HI segments containing related inverted repeats were isolated from D. melanogaster and analyzed by electron microscopy and restriction mapping. Southern blot experiments using single-copy flanking sequences as probes allowed the study of DNA arrangements at specific sites in the genomes of five closely related strains. We found that in some genomes the sequences with inverted repeats were present at a particular site, whereas in other genomes they were absent from this site. These results indicated that three of the sequences are transposable genetic elements. In one case we have purified the two corresponding DNA segments, with and without the sequence containing inverted repeats, thereby confirming the mobility of this sequence. These DNA elements were found to be distinct in two ways from copia and others previously described: first, they contain inverted terminal repeats, and second, they have a more heterogeneous construction."
https://openalex.org/W1964209695,"Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus DNA topoisomerase I are found to promote catenation of double-stranded DNA rings. At low DNA concentration dimeric catenanes are the major catenated products; at high DNA concentration or when spermidine is present, catenanes containing more than two rings are formed. There is no requirement of extensive sequence homology between the conponent rings forming a catenane; dimeric catenanes between Pseudomonas phage PM2 DNA and E. coli plasmid pBR322 are readily formed. The formation of a dimeric catenane by these type I topoisomerases, however, requires the presence of at least one preexisting single-chain scission in one of the two component rings. This is in contrast to the cases with the type II DNA topoisomerases which can form catenanes made of covalently closed rings only. The catenanes formed by the type I enzymes can be unlinked by the same enzymes, or by DNA gyrase, a type II enzyme, upon dilution of the isolated catenanes. The catenation and decatenation of duplex DNA rings adds a fourth type of reaction promoted by these type I DNA topoisomerases to the three reported previously: relaxation of superhelical DNA, interconversion between single-stranded DNA rings with and without knots and the intertwining of single-stranded DNA rings of complementary sequences into a covalently closed duplex ring with a high linking number. All four topoisomerization reactions involve the crossing of one DNA strand through a transient break of another DNA strand. The new reaction reported here suggests that such a crossover event might not require pairing of complementary nucleotide sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1480907586,"Abstract The state of the Na+- and K+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase ((Na,K)-ATPase) which binds vanadate was investigated by taking advantage of the slow rate of vanadate release (koff = 0.32/h at 25 degrees C and 0.045/h at 4 degrees C). Vanadate release from the enzyme could be accelerated approximately 2-fold by addition of K+ and 50-fold by addition of Na+. The K+ effect saturated hyperbolically with a K1/2 of 0.5 mM, while the Na+ effect had a sigmoidal activation curve and K1/2 of 250 mM. These results indicate that either Na+ or K+ can equilibrate with the enzyme prior to vanadate release. In the presence of vanadate, a saturable Mn2+ binding site could be detected with a dissociation constant of 120 nM. When 54Mn2+ was added during incubation of the enzyme with vanadate, 1 mol of 54Mn2+ could be trapped/mol of vanadate trapped and the two metals dissociated in parallel. This result indicates a single divalent cation site is involved in stabilizing vanadate (and probably phosphate) binding. Addition of 1 to 4 mM of ATP to the vanadate-trapped enzyme had no affect on the rate of vanadate release. Also, the high affinity ATP site could not be detected in equilibrium-binding studies with the vanadate-trapped enzyme. Since kinetic experiments indicate that vanadate binding is competitive with the low affinity ATP site (Cantley, L. C., Jr., Cantley, L. G., and Josephson, L. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 7361--7368) and the high affinity ATP site is absent on vanadate-trapped enzyme, it appears unlikely that ATP can occupy either a high or low affinity site on the vanadate-trapped enzyme. We show that nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plots for ATP hydrolysis can be explained by a single hydrolysis site which exhibits a low affinity for ATP prior to the rate-limiting E2 to E1 conformational change, but a high affinity for ATP following the conformational change."

https://openalex.org/W1493984199,"The presence of a receptor specific for the hemoglobin . haptoglobin complex is demonstrated in rat liver plasma membranes. Hemoglobin . haptoglobin complex, administered intravenously to rats, was cleared from the circulation at a constant rate with exclusive incorporation of the molecule into hepatocytes. This incorporation was unaffected by the simultaneous injection of asialoglycoprotein or heme . hemopexin complex. In vitro experiments with isolated liver plasma membranes indicated the absence of competitive binding of these molecules to the membrane and suggested that this receptor might recognize an altered conformation of the haptoglobin moiety of the complex resulting from the binding with hemoglobin. These observations suggest that the mechanism of recognition and binding of hemoglobin . haptoglobin complex by the receptor is different from that of the asialoglycoprotein receptor or heme . hemopexin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2046124635,"Man derives 70% of his dietary requirements of protein directly from the grains of cereals and legumes. These sources are respectively deficient in lysine (and secondarily threonine) and methionine and much effort is being devoted to their improvement. All three amino acids are derived from aspartate via a common metabolic pathway (Fig. 1) in which the first reaction catalysed by aspartate kinase is a key regulatory step limiting their production. In microorganisms, regulation of aspartate kinase occurs by a variety of mechanisms, commonly involving feedback inhibition of one or more isoenzymes by Lys plus Thr, Lys alone or Thr alone. On the other hand, Met control of this step does not seem to conform to a general pattern. Met represses, but does not inhibit aspartate kinase II of Escherichia coli; in other species Met can enhance or modify the effects of Lys or Thr. Similarly, varied controls involving Lys and Thr have been reported for the enzymes from higher plants with only one report of an effect of Met. In contrast to these previous results, we suggest here that the methionine derivative (S)-S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) is an important regulator of the Lys-sensitive aspartate kinase of higher plants, and that this regulatory mechanism is highly conserved. There is thus a major synergistic interaction of the two nutritionally deficient amino acids Lys and Met to inhibit their own syntheses at the primary regulatory step in the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1563259700,"Two decathymidylate analogues, d-(TpTp)4TpT-isomer 1 and isomer 2, having stereoregular, alternating methylphosphonate/phosphodiester backbones were prepared. The phosphodiester linkages of d-(TpTp)4TpT are cleaved slowly by snake venom phosphodiesterase in a stepwise manner, while slow random cleavage occurs with micrococcal nuclease which hydrolyzes isomer 2 faster than isomer 1. The CD spectra of isomer 1 and d-(Tp)9T are identical suggesting they have similar conformations, while that of isomer 2 shows an overall reduction of [theta]. Isomer 1 forms a 1T . 1A complex with poly(dA) and both 1T . 1A and 2T . 1A complexes with poly(rA), while isomer 2 forms a 2T . 1A complex of low thermal stability with poly(dA) and no complex with poly(rA). The Tm values of the partially nonionic d-(TpTp)4TpT . polynucleotide complexes are less dependent on salt concentration than are those of d-(Tp)9T. The stoichiometry and CD spectra of the complexes suggest that poly(dA) . isomer 1 duplex assumes a B-type geometry while isomer 2 . poly(dA) . isomer 2 triplex and the isomer 1 . poly(rA) complexes have an A-type geometry. Although there are no apparent differences between steric restrictions to rotation about the backbones of either isomer 1 or 2, or steric restrictions to complex formation, the results suggest that the configuration of the methylphosphate linkage controls: 1) interaction with nucleases, 2) oligomer conformation, and 3) interaction with polynucleotides. The latter effects may result from differences in solvation of the two isomers."
https://openalex.org/W2038626846,"Previous analysis of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication revealed a 2-4 fold excess of DNA molecules that were 90 +/- 2% replicated, demonstrating that replication forks accumulate near the termination site. To determine whether replication is arrested at specific DNA sites, forks were located on the SV40 genome by specifically 32P labelling 3' ends of nascent DNA on purified replicating SV40 DNA, isolating the longest 32P-DNA chains, annealing them to SV40 DNA and then digesting them with a restriction endonuclease that cut near the terminatin site. 32P-DNA fragments of several discrete lengths were released, demonstrating that replication forks on native chromosomes were arrested at preferred sites on the DNA. Most forks were arrested when bidirectional DNA replication was 91% completed, and the two forks were separated by about 470 bp of unreplicated DNA centered at the expected termination site. Forks were also arrested at other locations such that the center of the termination region defined by DNA arrest sites varied by +/- 450 bp. Electron microscopic analysis of replicating DNA suggested that such variation may result from asynchronous arrival of some replication forks. Analysis of 5' end-labeled nascent DNA demonstrated that initiation of Okazaki fragments was also promoted at preferred DNA sites (about 100-120 per genome). Thus specific DNA sequences appear to be utilized throughout DNA replication, not just at the origin."

https://openalex.org/W2157099810,"The switching of yeast mating-type alleles involves a transposition of a copy of a sequence from HML or HMR to replace the sequences at MAT. Using diploid strains of yeast we have discovered that about 1% of the homothalic conversions of MAT alleles are accompanied by large intrachromosomal rearrangements. These rearrangements are highly specific fusions of part of MAT either with HMR (to produce a deficiency ring chromosome). We conclude that the mechanism of MAT conversions involves a highly specific pairing between the homologous sequences at MAT and the donor genes HML or HMR followed by a specialized gene conversion event, in which the original allele is replaced by a sequence copied from HMR or HML. At about a 1% frequency conversion of the MAT locus is accompanied by a reciprocal recombination event that results in an intrachromosomal deletion. This same preferential pairing is reflected in a high frequency (> 10(-3)) of site-specific mitotic recombination between MAT alleles on differenat chromosomes. A gene conversion model also allows us to explain the ""illegal"" transpositions of MAT alleles to HMR or HML that occur when normal excision of MAT is prevented."
https://openalex.org/W1582456413,"Alveolar macrophages can be stimulated by concanavalin A to produce extracellular superoxide. Conflicting opinions exist, however, concerning the relative importance of the oxidation of either NADPH or NADH in the generation of (Formula: see text) by surface membrane-stimulated phagocytic cells. Alveolar macrophages were obtained from adult male rats by lavage with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells (approximately 10(6)/ml) were incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer and ferricytochrome c for 15 min at 37 degrees C before addition of concanavalin A. Release of (Formula: see text) was detected as the difference in cytochrome c reduction, followed at 550 nm, in the absence and presence of superoxide dismutase. Superoxide production by concanavalin A-stimulated alveolar macrophages was markedly increased in the presence of glucose but fructose, lactate, and pyruvate were without effect. Paraquat (methylviologen), an oxidation-reduction dye, significantly reduced concanavalin A-stimulated (Formula: see text) production when incubated at 1 mM with alveolar macrophages in the absence of glucose. The effect of paraquat was reversed by glucose, but fructose, lactate, and pyruvate could not reverse paraquat inhibition. Paraquat enhanced oxidation of NADPH (but not NADH) by cell supernatant and increased pentose phosphate shunt activity in resting macrophages, but did not affect mitochondrial respiration or ATP content of alveolar macrophages. These results suggest that paraquat is able to specifically deplete NADPH in alveolar macrophages while not affecting NADH or ATP. Our conclusion is that NADPH is essential for the production of (Formula: see text) by concanavalin A-stimulated alveolar macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2017571530,"Coated vesicles isolated from bovine adrenal cortex contain specific binding sites that recognize 125I-labeled human low density lipoprotein (LDL). These sites share the properties of the functional LDL receptors previously demonstrated on the surface of adrenal cells and in unfractionated adrenal membranes. Approximately 90% of the LDL receptors of the isolated coated vesicles were initially masked. Binding of 125I-LDL increased 10 fold after the vesicles were disrupted with the detergent octylglucoside. The LDL receptors of intact coated vesicles were also shielded from destruction by pronase; proteolytic destruction occurred only after the vesicles had been disrupted with octylglucoside. The adrenal coated vesicles measured 60 nm in diameter, suggesting that they were derived from the Golgi apparatus. Like the previously studied coated vesicles from brain and other tissues, the coated vesicles from adrenal cortex contained clathrin as the major protein component. In contrast to the coated vesicles of adrenal cortex, however, the brain coated vesicles failed to reveal masked LDL receptor activity when treated with octylglucoside. The current data indicate that isolated coated vesicles from the adrenal cortex contain LDL receptors and that these receptors exist in a masked form, apparently because their binding sites face the interior of the vesicle."
https://openalex.org/W1978172752,"Mating type switches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae occur by transposition of a replica of the ""source"" unexpressed loci HML and HMR to the mating type locus (MAT). The incoming information replaces previously expressed DNA, resulting in an interconversion of MAT alleles. A strain of genotype HML alpha/HML alpha MAT alpha/mata-missense HMR alpha/hmra-nonsense HO/ho generates cells with the genotype HML alpha/HML alpha MAT alpha/MAT a HMR alpha/hmra-nonsense HO/ho; that is, wild-type MATa+ recombinants are produced efficiently by a strain in which the incoming a information and the resident mata allele bear different mutations. Production of the wild-type MATa recombinants requires the homothallism (switching) function, and the incoming a information and the resident mata allele must bear different mutations. This result is consistent with the formation of a heteroduplex between the incoming and the outgoing DNA at MAT. Thus a process of unidirectional gene conversion as a mechanism for mating type gene transposition is favored. A molecular model based on a single-strand transfer is proposed. Results also favor the idea that the direction of switching is controlled by cell's mating phenotype rather than by the genetic content of MAT."

The lidocaine derivative QX-314 caused a time- and membrane potentia-dependent block of acetylcholine-induced current only when applied from the extracellular membrane surface. The same compounds caused a use-dependent block of the sodium channel only from the intracellular membrane surface. These experiments demonstrate a fundamental asymmetry of the acetylcholine receptor-channel complex."

https://openalex.org/W2019529735,"The Balbiani ring (BR) DNAs show prominent periodicities of restriction enzyme sites. Studies using a cloned fragment of the BRc gene strongly suggest that these periodicities reflect the existence of tandemly repetitive sequences within BR DNA. Tandem repeats measuring 54-58 bp have been demonstrated by partial sequence analysis of the BRc clone; the restriction site periodicities suggest the existence of additional 175 (= 3 X 58) and 1050 (= 6 X 175) bp repeat units. The short, medium and long repeats (58, 175 and 1050 bp, respectively) show sequence homology. Constrained unequal crossing over (resulting from misalignment of repeat arrays, usually by one repeat) is proposed as the mechanism for evolution of short, medium and long repeats from each other, in a manner analogous to evolution of satellite DNA sequences. Paradoxically, the dominant restriction site periodicities appear to be more conservative than might be expected on the basis of the overall sequence divergence between the sequenced repeats. This may be a consequence of functionally important, long-range amino acid or oligopeptide periodicities (for example, Asp x Ser or Glu x Ser corresponding to Hinf I sites) in the BRc protein product, in conjunction with preferential use of certain synonymous codons."

https://openalex.org/W2051508314,"Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that pituitary hormones may be delivered directly to the brain. Concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the plasma were determined in blood samles obtained simultaneously from the carotid artery, the sagittal sinus, and the jugular vein of three awake sheep. Seizures were induced electrically to stimulate ACTH secretion, and at precise intervals thereafter several simultaneous comparisons were made in each animal. In many of the post-seizure comparisons, the ACTH plasma concentrations within the sagital sinus exceeded those within the carotid artery as well as those within the jugular vein, indicating that this hormone was released from the pituitary and carried directly through capillary beds of brain to the venous blood within the sagittal sinus. The experiment was repeated in one hypophysectomized sheep and, in this animal, ACTH concentration in the plasma was reduced, but that in the sagittal sinus still was elevated after the seizure, an indication that some ACTH (or ACTH-like material) was released from the brain itself."

https://openalex.org/W1561735376,"The reduction of horse heart cytochrome c with ascorbate in the absence of urea and in its presence, 0 to 8 M, pH 7.0, has been investigated using a stopped flow technique and the absorptivity at 550 nm as the monitoring probes, and by using the rate of oxidizability with molecular oxygen. Reduction is found to be consistent with a mechanism involving (i) a urea-dependent equilibrium step between an ascorbate-reducible and an irreducible form, with a [urea]1/2 of 7.5 M and a reversion rate constant of 0.05 +/- 0.02 s-1, (ii) the binding of ascorbate to cytochrome c, with a binding constant of 5.9 M-1 in the absence of urea which decreases to a value of 2.7 M-1 above 5.5 M urea, and (iii) a reduction step, with a urea-independent rate constant of 2.9 +/- 0.3 s-1. This scheme is interpreted in terms of an electron-transfer pathway involving neither the classical adjacent attack nor attack at the exposed heme edge, i.e. remote attack, but rather, through an alternate pathway involving binding at some site other than the heme crevice opening and a migration path of rather low electron-transfer efficiency. The urea-linked ascorbate reduction step is th X2 in equilibrium D step of the urea denaturation mechanism (Myer, Y. P., MacDonald L. H., Verma, B. C., and Pande, A. J. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 199-207), and the 9 M urea form, D, is the irreducible form. Form X2 and the other intermediate form, X1, are found to be reducible directly by ascorbate, and not through reversion to the native form of the protein. both the integrity of the heme crevice and the polypeptide-organized structures are of little importance as far as ascorbate reducibility is concerned, but the integrity of the structural and protein functional changes reflecting the X2 in equilibrium D step of the mechanism directly or indirectly determines the reducibility of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1493601924,"The cytoplasmic petite (rho-) mutant DS400/A12 has been obtained from the wild type strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B/A21. The DS400/A12 clone has a mitochondrial genome with a 7.6-kilobase pair, tandemly repeated segment of DNA. Genetic tests indicate that DS400/A12 contains all the cob1 and cob2 markers of the cytochrome b gene. The gene has been further dissected by mutagenesis of DS400/A12 and selection of secondary rho- clones with simpler genotypes. Restriction analysis of the mtDNAs of the rho- clones was used to construct the complete restriction map of the cytochrome b region and to map the mutations within narrowly defined physical limits. The cytochrome b mutants scatter over a maximal distance of 3.3 kilobase pairs. All the mutations assigned previously to the cob2 locus are found between 71.6 and 73.2 units. The cob1 mutations are located between 74.6 and 76.3 units. The estimated distance between the two loci is at least 1 kilobase pair."
https://openalex.org/W1584253890,Methyl-4-azidobenzoimidate was reacted with horse heart cytochrome c to give a photoaffinity-labeled derivative of this heme protein. The modified cytochrome c bound to cytochrome c-depleted mitochondria with the same Kd as native cytochrome c and restored oxygen uptake to the same extent. Irradiation of cytochrome c-depleted mitochondrial membranes with 3- to 4-fold excess of photoaffinity-labeled cytochrome c over cytochrome c oxidase resulted in covalent binding of the derivative to the membranes. Fractionation of the irradiated mitochondria in the presence of detergents and salts followed by chromatography on an agarose Bio-Gel-A-5m showed that the labeled cytochrome c was bound covalently to succinate-cytochrome c reductase. The covalently bound cytochrome c was active in mediating electron transfer between its reductase and oxidase. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the succinate-cytochrome c reductase containing photoaffinity-labeled 125I-cytochrome c showed that the reductase contained a protein binding site for cytochrome c. It is suggested that cytochrome c1 is the most likely site for the cytochrome c binding in mitochondria in situ.
https://openalex.org/W2169459923,"The synthesis of polyoma DNA in virus-infected 3T6 mouse fibroblasts is discontinuous with the intermediate formation of short Okazaki fragments. Hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase, inhibits polyoma DNA synthesis, as measured by incorporation of radioactive thymidine. In the inhibited state, almost all incorporation occurs into short fragments. We investigated to what extent formation of short DNA fragments might be the result of incorporation of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) into DNA, followed by excision and repair reactions. We devised a sensitive enzymatic method for measuring dUTP in cell extracts which allows the determination of the dUTP pool when this pool amounts to between 0.1 and 2% of the dTTP pool. No dUTP was detected in growing mouse fibroblasts. After infection with polyoma virus cell extracts contained 0.4% dUTP (of dTTP) at the peak of DNA synthesis. Addition of hydroxyurea at this point led to a disappearance of dUTP. We conclude that dUTP incorporation can contribute only minimally to the generation of short fragments during polyoma DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1675424363,"Abstract The conformational properties of nucleotides containing the fluorophore 1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate attached via a gamma-phosphoamidate bond have been examined. Measurements of fluorescence excitation spectra show that energy absorbed by adenine in the ATP analog is transferred to the naphthalene moiety with an efficiency of approximately 43%. In nonpolar solvents transfer is almost eliminated. The fluorescence intensity of the UTP analog is quenched. Measurements of quantum yield and excited state lifetime show that this occurs by both dynamic and static mechanisms. Thus, fluorescence studies show that both the purine and pyrimidine analogs exist in an equilibrium mixture of stacked and unstacked forms. NMR studies show that the base and ribose protons of the ATP and UTP analogs are shifted upfield by about 0.2 to 0.3 ppm, presumably due to ring current effects produced by stacking interactions. Phosphorus NMR spectra of the ATP analog are generally similar to spectra of unmodified ATP. The strong dependence on conformation of the fluorescence of the pyrimidine analogs may prove useful in studies of protein-nucleotide interactions."
