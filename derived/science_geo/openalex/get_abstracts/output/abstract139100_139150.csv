https://openalex.org/W2052558531,"Light gap disturbances have been postulated to play a major role in maintaining tree diversity in species-rich tropical forests. This hypothesis was tested in more than 1200 gaps in a tropical forest in Panama over a 13-year period. Gaps increased seedling establishment and sapling densities, but this effect was nonspecific and broad-spectrum, and species richness per stem was identical in gaps and in nongap control sites. Spatial and temporal variation in the gap disturbance regime did not explain variation in species richness. The species composition of gaps was unpredictable even for pioneer tree species. Strong recruitment limitation appears to decouple the gap disturbance regime from control of tree diversity in this tropical forest."

Changes in spontaneous and stimulus-induced patterns of LC activity correlated closely with fluctuations in behavioral performance. The model explains these fluctuations in terms of changes in electrotonic coupling among LC neurons and predicts improved performance during epochs of high coupling and synchronized LC firing. Cross correlations of simultaneously recorded LC neurons confirmed this prediction, indicating that electrotonic coupling in LC may play an important role in attentional modulation and the regulation of goal-directed versus exploratory behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2071055800,"Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNF-R1) contains a cytoplasmic death domain that is required for the signaling of TNF activities such as apoptosis and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation. Normally, these signals are generated only after TNF-induced receptor aggregation. However, TNF-R1 self-associates and signals independently of ligand when overexpressed. This apparent paradox may be explained by silencer of death domains (SODD), a widely expressed approximately 60-kilodalton protein that was found to be associated with the death domain of TNF-R1. TNF treatment released SODD from TNF-R1, permitting the recruitment of proteins such as TRADD and TRAF2 to the active TNF-R1 signaling complex. SODD also interacted with death receptor-3 (DR3), another member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Thus, SODD association may be representative of a general mechanism for preventing spontaneous signaling by death domain-containing receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2124025293,"Neuronal rhythmic activities within thalamocortical circuits range from partially synchronous oscillations during normal sleep to hypersynchrony associated with absence epilepsy. It has been proposed that recurrent inhibition within the thalamic reticular nucleus serves to reduce synchrony and thus prevents seizures. Inhibition and synchrony in slices from mice devoid of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A (GABAA) receptor beta3 subunit were examined, because in rodent thalamus, beta3 is largely restricted to reticular nucleus. In beta3 knockout mice, GABAA-mediated inhibition was nearly abolished in reticular nucleus, but was unaffected in relay cells. In addition, oscillatory synchrony was dramatically intensified. Thus, recurrent inhibitory connections within reticular nucleus act as ""desynchronizers."""
https://openalex.org/W2076229947,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that is responsible for the generation of NADPH, which is required in many detoxifying reactions. We have recently demonstrated that G6PD expression is induced by a variety of chemical agents acting at different steps in the biochemical pathway controlling the intracellular redox status. Although we obtained evidence that the oxidative stress-mediated enhancement of G6PD expression is a general phenomenon, the functional significance of such G6PD induction after oxidant insult is still poorly understood. In this report, we used a GSH-depleting drug that determines a marked decrease in the intracellular pool of reduced glutathione and a gradual but notable increase in G6PD expression. Both effects are seen soon after drug addition. Once G6PD activity has reached the maximum, the GSH pool is restored. We suggest and also provide the first direct evidence that G6PD induction serves to maintain and regenerate the intracellular GSH pool. We used HeLa cell clones stably transfected with the human G6PD gene that display higher G6PD activity than the parent HeLa cells. Although the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase were comparable in all strains, the concentrations of GSH were significantly higher in G6PD-overexpressing clones. A direct consequence of GSH increase in these cells is a decreased reactive oxygen species production, which makes these cells less sensitive to the oxidative burst produced by external stimuli. Indeed, all clones that constitutively overexpress G6PD exhibited strong protection against oxidants-mediated cell killing. We also observe that NF-κB activation, in response to tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, is strongly reduced in human HeLa cells overexpressing G6PD. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that is responsible for the generation of NADPH, which is required in many detoxifying reactions.

Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; BSO, l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; DOC, sodium deoxycholate; DCFH-DA, dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α. are produced inside the cell during oxidative metabolism, and they are involved in human diseases such as arteriosclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down's syndrome, re-perfusion shock syndrome, and cancer (1Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar, 2Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Abnormal production of ROSs can damage macromolecules such as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins and therefore participate in necrotic cell death and apoptosis (4Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Inside the cell, ROSs are scavenged by both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant pathways. Reduced glutathione (GSH), a cysteine-containing tripeptide, is required to maintain the normal reduced state of the cells and to counteract all the deleterious effects of oxidative stress. GSH is synthesized inside the cells through a complex biochemical pathway composed of several well known enzymes (5Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17205-17208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the reaction of H2O2scavenging, GSH is oxidized to GSSG by the enzyme GSH peroxidase (6Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). The reduction of GSSG to GSH is catalyzed by GSSG reductase, which uses NADPH as reducing potential. NADPH is also required for the formation of active catalase tetramers. This latter enzyme catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 in H2O and O2 (7Kirkman H.N. Gaetani G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 81: 4343Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 8Kirkman H.N. Galiano S. Gaetani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 660-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Catalase is mainly peroxisomal, whereas the GSSG reductase/GSH peroxidase cycle is active in the cytoplasm. The NADPH required for the production of both GSH and catalase is produced by the pentose phosphate pathway (9Cohen G. Hochstein P. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 1420-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 10Gaetani G.F. Galiano S. Canepa L. Ferraris A.M. Kirkman H.N. Blood. 1989; 23: 334-339Crossref Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, has long been regarded as important in the biosynthesis of the sugar moiety of nucleic acids (11Luzzatto L. Metha A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. MacGraw Hill, New York1995: 3367-3398Google Scholar). Until recently, the role of this housekeeping enzyme in the cell response to oxidative stress was limited to human erythrocytes that lack any other NADPH-producing route (12Vulliamy T. Mason P. Luzzatto L. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 138-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Beutler E. Vulliamy T. Luzzatto L. Hum. Genet. 1996; 29: 49-56Google Scholar). However, recent results have demonstrated that this enzyme also plays a protective role against ROSs in nucleated eucaryotic cells that possess alternative routes for the production of NADPH. Indeed, in the lower eucaryoteSaccharomyces cerevisiae, mutants in the G6PD gene are sensitive to oxidants that specifically deplete the intracellular pool of GSH (14Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mouse ES cells containing G6PD null mutation are uniquely sensitive to oxidants (15Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In every cell line so far tested, as well as in lymphocyte primary cultures, we demonstrated that G6PD expression is enhanced by oxidative stress induced by agents that either increase the intracellular concentration of O·̄2 or decrease the GSH pool. The mechanism regulating G6PD expression appears to affect the rate of transcription initiation (16Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we confirm that G6PD expression is induced by drugs that decrease the intracellular GSH pool; indeed, this increase is blocked by treatment with antioxidants that specifically replenish the intracellular GSH. We also observed that, rapidly after drug treatment, GSH decreases and G6PD is enhanced. When G6PD reaches maximal induction, GSH pool is restored, suggesting that GSH equilibrium could be dependent from G6PD expression. We have isolated and extensively characterized HeLa clones that overexpress G6PD and thus have increased G6PD activity. We observe that the activity of other enzymes in these cells, such as GSSG reductase, GSH peroxidase, catalase, or 6PGD (the second enzyme of pentose phosphate pathway) remain unchanged. Furthermore, these cells feature increased intracellular levels of GSH and consequently, lower ROSs levels with respect to control cells. The G6PD-overexpressing cells exhibit a markedly decreased NF-κB DNA binding activity, produced by the TNF-α-dependent ROS burst, and a marked increase in cellular resistance to apoptosis induced by hydrogen peroxide and TNF-α. In conclusion, the results reported here suggest that G6PD is part of an inducible mechanism of cell response to oxidative stress; furthermore, they support the hypothesis that G6PD plays a key role in the control of intracellular reductive potential by increasing the intracellular content of glutathione, which, in turn, decreases ROS levels. This overall intracellular reduced environment may facilitate cellular protection against oxidant injuries. The human hepatoma Hep3B cell line and HeLa cell line were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were cultured and stably transfected as described elsewhere (17Ursini M.V. Lettieri T. Braddock M. Martini G. Virology. 1993; 196: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGD15neo has been described (18Chen E.Y. Cheng A. Lee A. Kuang W.J. Weigelt L. Green P. Schlessinger D. Genomics. 1991; 10: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); it also contains a Neo gene driven by the SV40 early promoter. Control HeLa cells were transfected with the same plasmid devoid of all the human G6PD coding sequences. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and clones were selected and cultured in 400 μg/ml G418. No significant change in G6PD levels (mRNA, protein, and activity) was detectable between wild type and vector control-transfected clones (HeLa-neo). All the experiments described here were performed on actively growing cells. To summarize briefly, the medium was removed and cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing the indicated concentrations of H2O2 (Merck), NAC, PDTC (Sigma), and diamide (Calbiochem); the concentration of each oxidant used was empirically determined. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh medium was added. G6PD activity was determined, as already described (19Battistuzzi G. D'Urso M. Toniolo D. Persico M.G. Luzzatto L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), by measuring the rate of production of NADPH. Since 6PGD, the second enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, also produces NADPH, both 6PGD and total dehydrogenase activity (G6PD+6PGD) were measured separately, as described elsewhere (20Tian W.N. Pignatare N.J. Stanton C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in order to obtain accurate enzyme activity. G6PD activity was calculated by subtracting the activity of 6PGD from total enzyme activity. Catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase activities, and total protein concentration were determined according to Aebi (21Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18933) Google Scholar), Carlberg (22Carlberg I. Mannervick B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 485-490Google Scholar), Mannervick (23Mannervick B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), respectively. Cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis and staining for G6PD was carried out according to published methods (25Town M. Athanasiou-Metaxa M. Luzzatto L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. (a) Gel running buffer was 85 mm Trizma base, pH 9.2, 35 mmglycine, 58 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm EDTA, 36.6 mm NADP. (b) Length of run was 90 min at 100 V at room temperature. (c) Gel staining solution was 0.1 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mg/ml glucose 6-phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml NADP, 0.15 mg/ml dimethylthiazol-2-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, 0.1 mg/ml phenazine methosulfate, 20 mmMgCl2. 15 μg of protein lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose filter was incubated with rabbit anti-human G6PD antibody supplied by U. Benatti (26Benatti U. Morelli A. Meloni T. Sparatore B.S.F. Michetti M. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 29: 225-229Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in 3% bovine serum albumin. For detection of rabbit antibodies, the filter was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) and developed with a substrate of 0.5 mg/ml 4-cloronaphthol and 0.33% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 mTris-HCl. Immunoblots using an antibody raised against human β-actin (Amersham Corp.) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. They were revealed with the ECL kit from Amersham, and autoradiographs were recorded onto X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Gel shift assays were performed using standard methods; a double-stranded κB oligonucleotide, whose sequence has already been described (27Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar), was used as probe. The oligonucleotide was labeled using Klenow enzyme. The radiolabeled probe was incubated with HeLa nuclear extract for 30 min at room temperature. For oligonucleotide competition analysis, a 100-fold molar excess of cold competitor was also added to the mixture. In order to carry out DNA binding assays in which antibodies were included, antibodies were added to the binding assay mixtures and incubated for 2 h on ice before the addition of radiolabeled probe. The p65 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were made using Lee's method (28Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). DOC treatment was performed by incubating the cytosolic fraction from unstimulated cells for 15 min with 0.8% DOC and 1% Nonidet P-40 before electrophoretic mobility shift assay (29Hansen S.K. Baeuerle P.A. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1994; 14: 2593-2603Google Scholar). A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImagerTM system was used to analyze the gels. Intracellular reduced glutathione content was estimated using the Bioxitech GSH-400 enzymatic method (OXIS) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total cellular protein material (from 6 × 106 cells) was precipitated in 5% metaphosphoric acid and the resulting supernatant was used for the test. The level of GSH present in each cell type was calculated according to standard curves of increasing GSH concentrations. Formation of ROSs was measured using DCFH-DA according to Royall and Ischiropoulos (30Royall A.J. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Cells (6 × 106) were pre-loaded with 5 mm DCFH (Molecular Probes) in the culture medium for 30 min. Measurement were carried out in duplicates using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. Dead cells and debris were excluded by forward/side scatter gating . Cells were plated 24 h before the assay at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. Apoptoic cell death was induced by H2O2 and TNF-α used at the indicated concentration. 24 h after induction of apoptosis, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in the same buffer and fixed with ice cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and DNA content was analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer by red fluorescence. Apoptotic cells appear as a broad hypodiploid DNA peak preceding the peak of diploid DNA from viable cells. Cells containing a lower amount of DNA and a side scatter higher than that of G0/G1 cells were considered to be apoptotic (31Sherwood S.W. Schimke R.T. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Darzynkiewicz Z. Bruno S. Del Bino G. Gorczyca W. Hotz M.A. Lassota P. Traganos F. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). We have already reported that several oxidative drugs, whose final effect is to decrease the intracellular GSH pool, enhanced the expression of G6PD and that this regulation is achieved at the levels of transcription of this gene (16Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the first experiment, human Hep3B cells were treated with diamide, a powerful sulfhydryl group-oxidizing agent that specifically causes the depletion of glutathione without any other observable effect (33Kosower E.M. Kosover N.S. Nature. 1969; 224: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). During the same experiment, we tested the antioxidant ability of both NAC and PDTC. NAC is a GSH precursor (34Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar), whereas PDTC is a metal-chelating agent, which complexes Fe3+ and other metal ions; these, by means of the Fenton reaction, participate in the production of hydroxyl radicals from H2O2 (35Ziegler D.M. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 85-97Google Scholar). Hep3B cells were exposed to 500 μm diamide for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline; the buffer was then replaced with fresh medium. In the cases in which NAC (30 mm) or PDTC (500 μm) were used, each antioxidant was added to the cells 1 h before diamide treatment. Two hour after cell treatments, G6PD activity was analyzed by both spectrophotometric assay and cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis. This last method allows a specific determination of G6PD activity without the interference of other NADPH-producing enzymes (25Town M. Athanasiou-Metaxa M. Luzzatto L. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1990; 16: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). During the same experiments, we also measured the levels of G6PD protein by immunoblot analysis of total cellular proteins probed with anti-G6PD antiserum (26Benatti U. Morelli A. Meloni T. Sparatore B.S.F. Michetti M. Melloni E. Pontremoli S. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 29: 225-229Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the same immunoblot, β-actin protein levels was also measured as reference (Fig. 1). As reported in TableI, we found that G6PD activity was 2.1-fold increased in diamide-treated cells; this increase is abolished by NAC pretreatment (see also Fig. 1 B for cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis analysis of G6PD activity). A similar result was observed when another GSH precursor, glutathione diethyl ester, was used instead of NAC (data not shown). PDTC does not counteract diamide effect but, rather, determines an enhancement of G6PD protein levels and of G6PD activity comparable to that observed with diamide (2.1-fold). This is not surprising since this compound can exert either antioxidant or pro-oxidant effects in different situations (36Nobel C.S.I. Kimland M. Lind B. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26202-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was demonstrated that PDTC and other dithiocarbamates may cause oxidation of GSH by means of a non-radical mechanism (35Ziegler D.M. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 85-97Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the PDTC-mediated increase of G6PD is also counteracted by NAC (Table I).Table IEffects of oxidants and antioxidants on G6PD activity in Hep3B cellsNo additionNACPDTCNo addition45.6 ± 2.935.8 ± 3.796.5 ± 7.7Diamide94.6 ± 4.337.7 ± 5.695.6 ± 8.0BSO93.9 ± 2.639.9 ± 2.990.8 ± 7.5PDTC96.5 ± 7.737.3 ± 2.6NDHep3B cells were treated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline with or without (No addition) 500 μm diamide, 500 μm BSO, or 500 μm PDTC (listed in the first column) preceded or not (No addition) by pretreatment with either 30 mm NAC or 500 μm PDTC for 1 h in growth medium (listed in the first row).

At the end of incubation period G6PD activity was determined and defined as nanomoles of reduced NADP/min/mg of protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are given as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. ND, not determined. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the results obtained by activity determination, perfectly parallel to what was observed using protein analysis. Hence, the GSH-mediated regulation of G6PD activity results from regulated levels of this protein. Identical results were obtained when BSO, an effective inhibitor of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in biosynthesis of GSH) (6Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar), was used in place of diamide to reduce the intracellular GSH content (Table I). Results comparable to those reported in Table I were obtained in HeLa cells after diamide or BSO treatments (data not shown). We then compared the kinetics of increase of G6PD activity and the levels of intracellular GSH after diamide treatment. Hep3B cells were treated with diamide as reported in Fig. 1; cells were collected at the indicated time points. As reported in Fig.2, we observed a slight but reproducible enhancement of G6PD activity (1.3-fold) as soon as 10 min after drug treatment; simultaneously, GSH was dramatically reduced (80% reduction). As G6PD activity gradually increases, the levels of intracellular GSH had restored and, when G6PD reaches the maximum levels, GSH levels are 30% higher than in untreated control cells. 8 h after treatment, both G6PD activity and GSH levels returned to normal level. These observations indicate that G6PD expression is inversely correlated to GSH intracellular levels and may also suggest that GSH replenishment may depend on G6PD expression. In order to assess how G6PD expression may influence GSH levels, cell lines producing increased levels of G6PD were generated. Human HeLa cells were stably transfected with an eucaryotic expression vector containing the entire human G6PD gene (18Chen E.Y. Cheng A. Lee A. Kuang W.J. Weigelt L. Green P. Schlessinger D. Genomics. 1991; 10: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed several cell clones carrying pGd15neo that had increased levels of G6PD expression. As reported in Fig. 3, two of these clones were analyzed in more detail. Clone HeLa-Gd3 and clone HeLa-Gd4 show 3-fold increase in G6PD protein and G6PD activity compared with vector-control transfected clones (HeLa-neo). The increased levels of G6PD protein were also confirmed by the increase in G6PD mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). Subsequently, we evaluated the effect of G6PD expression on the activities of the enzyme of GSSG recycling (GSSG reductase and GSH peroxidase), on the activity of H2O2-detoxifying enzyme catalase and on 6PGD, the second enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. We also analyzed the levels of intracellular GSH. Overexpression and increased activity of G6PD have no significant effect on GSSG reductase, GSH peroxidase, catalase, and 6PGD activities; on the other hand, a 2.3-fold increase of GSH levels were detectable in both HeLa-Gd3 and HeLa-Gd4 clones with respect to control HeLa-neo cells (TableII).Table IIActivity of antioxidant enzymes in HeLa cells overexpressing or not overexpressing human G6PDGSHPxGRCatalase6PGDGSHG6PDHeLa-neo102.5 ± 1.518.6 ± 1.57.3 ± 0.142.5 ± 2.510.9 ± 1.773.5 ± 12.5Gd390.5 ± 16.519.6 ± 4.16.6 ± 0.738.8 ± 0.722.4 ± 2.6235.5 ± 37.0Gd4106.5 ± 6.517.9 ± 3.96.6 ± 0.240.0 ± 2.025.4 ± 2.9226.0 ± 18.0The enzyme activities are defined as following: G6PD and 6PGD, nanomoles of reduced NADP/min/mg of protein; catalase, micromoles of H2O2/min/mg of protein assayed at 30 mmH2O2; GSHPx, nanomoles of NADPH/min/mg of protein assayed at 2 mm GSH; GR, nanomoles of NADPH/min/mg of protein; GSH, nmol/106 cells.

We then investigated whether the increased GSH levels associated with G6PD overexpression might have resulted from decreased levels of ROSs production in those cells. Therefore, we analyzed the ROS levels in control HeLa-neo, Gd3 (Fig. 3), and Gd4 (not shown) clones with DCFH-DA, which is converted to DCF by ROS-mediated oxidation (30Royall A.J. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Cells stained with DCF were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting. The results reported in Fig.4 clearly show a significant decrease in the intensity of DCF fluorescence resulting from the overexpression of G6PD (44% of the control cells). The question remained as to whether the G6PD overexpression-mediated lower ROS intracellular levels resulted from a higher detoxification of ROSs due to elevated concentrations of reduced glutathione; alternatively, G6PD may have directly reduced the basic ROS formation and, as a consequence, increased the cellular concentration of glutathione. The production of ROSs was therefore analyzed in glutathione-depleted control HeLa-neo cells as well as Gd3 and Gd4 clones by using the in vivo conversion of DCFH-DA to fluorescent DCF. Glutathione depletion was induced by 24-h incubation of the cells with 1 mm BSO, a glutathione synthesis inhibitor (6Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). This treatment depleted glutathione by >99% in all types of cells (data not shown) and increased the rate of ROS formation (Fig. 4). It is of interest that the G6PD-mediated lower rate of ROS formation, which was clearly detectable in non-BSO-treated cells, was almost completely abolished by the glutathione depletion. This supports the hypothesis that G6PD acts at the level of glutathione metabolism rather than the level of ROS formation. The ability of G6PD expression to decrease ROS levels was investigated using targets that are particularly sensitive to oxidative burst. We therefore analyzed the TNF-α-mediated activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in HeLa cells together with Gd3 and Gd7 clones. Most inducers of NF-κB seem to rely on the production of ROSs, as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of several antioxidants, including NAC (33Kosower E.M. Kosover N.S. Nature. 1969; 224: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A causal link between ROS production and TNF-α-mediated NF-κB induction was clearly demonstrated (27Schreck R. Meier B. Mannel D.N. Droge W. Baeuerle P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar,37Schreck R. Baeuerle P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-kB by TNF-α was analyzed by in vitro DNA binding and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared from control HeLa cells as well as Gd3 and Gd4 clones that were either left untreated or exposed to TNF-α. DNA binding assays were performed using a DNA probe encompassing the κB motif (see “Experimental Procedures”). As seen in Fig. 4, 2-h treatment with 25–200 units/ml TNF-α induced, in control HeLa cells, the binding of a protein factor to κB oligonucleotide. Competition experiments revealed that the binding to the radioactive κB DNA was no more detectable when increasing concentration of nonradioactive κB DNA were added to the binding mixture. A supershift band was also observed when the reaction mixture was incubated with an antibody that recognizes the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB. Hence, TNF-α induced the binding of NF-κB to the κB oligonucleotide in HeLa cells. The binding was greatly reduced in Gd3 cells (Fig.5) and Gd4 cells (not shown), which overexpress G6PD with respect to control HeLa-neo cells. In order to determine the amount of inducible NF-κB present in the cytoplasm of HeLa-neo and HeLa-Gd3 cells, we treated cytoplasmic fraction obtained from both cells with 0.8% DOC and 1% Nonidet P-40. This treatment allows the dissociation of IκB-α from NF-κB and thus restores the DNA binding ability of this factor. As shown in Fig. 5(lanes 13 and 15), DOC treatment promotes similar levels of NF-κB binding to κB DNA in HeLa-neo and HeLa-Gd3. This indicates that the increase in G6PD activity did not alter the intrinsic ability of NF-κB to bind DNA, but rather at least partially impairs the process that leads to the activation of this factor due to oxidative stress. Since G6PD overexpression raises the intracellular glutathione content and, as consequence, decrease the intracellular ROS production, we investigated whether this phenomenon can influence the survival of these cells exposed to oxidants burst. Apoptosis was produced in adherent cells treated with both hydrogen peroxide and TNF-α at the indicated concentrations. In this experiment, we also used parent HeLa cells as control. 24 h after treatment, the rate of apoptotic death was measured on cells fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with propidium iodide, and subsequently analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry. The data shown in Fig. 6clearly demonstrate that cell death was strongly decreased in G6PD-overexpressing cells (Gd3 and Gd4) in comparison to control cells (HeLa and HeLa-neo). Thus, the levels of G6PD have a dramatic effect on the susceptibility to apoptotic cell death induced by both agents. We have already shown that G6PD expression is up-regulated by oxidants through a mechanism acting mainly on the rate of transcription of this gene (16Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here we show that this effect is specifically counteracted by NAC, an antioxidant that replenishes the GSH pool (35Ziegler D.M. Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1991: 85-97Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that G6PD increase precedes full GSH restoration, through kinetic analysis of G6PD expression after drug treatment. G6PD overexpression in HeLa cells therefore determines an increase in GSH and a consequent decrease of intracellular ROSs. We show that G6PD expression controls intracellular GSH without interfering with the activity of the other enzymes involved in the peroxide/hydroperoxide-detoxifying pathway. As a result, cells overexpressing G6PD have an overall reduced state. Consequently, downstream effects induced by ROSs burst are buffered in these cells. We found that G6PD overexpression interferes negatively with the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB by TNF-α and decreases susceptibility to apoptotic signals induced by hydrogen peroxide and TNF-α. It has been recently suggested that the primary physiological role of G6PD in mammalian cells is the defense against oxidative injuries (15Pandolfi P.P. Sonati F. Rivi R. Mason P. Grosveld F. Luzzatto L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar,38Martini G. Ursini M.V. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 1-8Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The question remains as to how G6PD exerts this protective effect. Several pieces of evidence indicated that the formation of GSH from its oxidized form, GSSG, is dependent on NADPH produced by the pentose phosphate pathway and that this pathway can be activated in response to GSH depletion (39Clancy R.M. Levartovsky D. Leszczynska-Piziak J. Yegudin J. Abramson S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3680-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, we suggest that levels of G6PD may have a dominant role in the control of output of GSH and thus in the maintaining of an intracellular redox potential. An alternative explanation could be that G6PD is involved in a mechanism that promotes glutathione storage. Therefore, the exact biochemical mechanism underlying the antioxidant properties of G6PD enzyme require a more thorough investigation. Besides the enzymes directly involved in the production and detoxification of ROSs, several proteins have been shown to decrease the net intracellular generation of ROSs and consequently interfere with the downstream effects of oxidative stress. Some proteins, such as bcl-2, have been proposed to control intracellular ROSs levels in a GSH-independent way (40Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Science. 1993; 262: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). Other, such as the small heat shock protein hsp27, lead to a decreased production of ROSs as derived from the increased intracellular GSH content (41Mehlem P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). In this last case, the hsp27-dependent G6PD enhanced expression was proposed as an explanation of this phenomenon. 2A. P. Arrigo, personal communication. Furthermore, decreased ROSs production has been reported in cells with constitutive decreased expression of transaldolase, the key enzyme of nonoxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway (42Banki K. Hutter E. Colombo E. Gonchoroff N.J. Perl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32994-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), or in cells overexpressing GSH peroxidase (43Kretz-Remy C. Mehlen P. Mirault M.E. Arrigo A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In both cases lower ROSs were derived from an increased GSH/GSSG ratio. In this paper we show that G6PD shares the same properties, but, more interestingly, it is subject to rapid up-regulation in response to oxidative stress. This could be a general rule, since we have already shown that G6PD expression is increased in several human cell lanes by drugs that ultimately lead to GSH depletion (16Ursini M.V. Parrella A. Rosa G. Salzano S. Martini G. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Ursini M.V. Lettieri T. Braddock M. Martini G. Virology. 1993; 196: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that, in primary cultures of human and bovine lymphocytes, pesticide-mediated genotoxic effects are coupled to oxidative stress and G6PD up-regulation (44Lioi M.B. Scarfi M.R. Santoro A. Barbieri R. Zeni O. Di Berardino D. Ursini M.V. Mutat. Res. 1998; 403: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 45Lioi M.B. Scarfi M.R. Santoro A. Barbieri R. Zeni O. Salvemini F. Di Berardino D. Ursini M.V. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1998; 32: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, as G6PD enzyme levels were found to be positively regulated by a number of stimuli, such as platelet-derived growth factor (20Tian W.N. Pignatare N.J. Stanton C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14798-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and ischemia reperfusion (46Nishiki K. Jamieson D. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1976; 160: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 47Kletzien R.F. Harris P.K. Foellmi L.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), it would be interesting to investigate whether G6PD-enhanced expression can always be related to change in the cellular redox conditions. It is well known that G6PD is expressed in all cell types, although at varying levels (19Battistuzzi G. D'Urso M. Toniolo D. Persico M.G. Luzzatto L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We suggest that G6PD serves as a critical determinant of tissue- and cell type-specific sensitivity to oxidative stress signals. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that other pentose phosphate pathway enzymes, or enzymes involved in the control of peroxide/hydroperoxide scavenging pathway, may have an alternative role to G6PD in different cell types.

The existence of only one large inhibitor binding pocket in the hydrophobic part of complex I is discussed in the light of possible mechanisms of proton translocation. The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC1.6.99.3, complex I) is the first membrane-bound electron transport complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone is coupled to the translocation of two protons per electron across the inner mitochondrial membrane (1Wikström M.K.F. FEBS Lett. 1984; 169: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 2Weiss H. Friedrich T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1991; 23: 743-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thereby, complex I accounts for up to 40% of the proton-translocating capacity of the respiratory chain. Complex I is present in the mitochondria of most eukaryotic organisms and many bacteria. In mammals, it consists of 43 different subunits with a molecular mass of ∼1,000 kDa (3Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The homologous procaryotic complex I has a minimal number of 14 different subunits with a total molecular mass of ∼500 kDa (4Yagi T. Yano T. Matsuno-Yagi A. J. Bioenerg.

Biol. 1998; 277: 1033-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) indicates an L-shaped structure with two domains arranged perpendicular to each other that are called peripheral and membrane arm (9Hofhaus G. Weiss H. Leonard K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In mitochondrial complex I, seven nuclear-encoded proteins with strong homology to their bacterial counterparts form the peripheral part (10Schulte U. Fecke W. Krüll C. Nehls U. Schmiede A. Schneider R. Ohnishi T. Weiss H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Finel M. Majander A.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These subunits carry the NADH binding site and the redox groups, namely noncovalently bound FMN and the iron-sulfur centers N-1 to N-5 (12Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The membrane arm contains the remaining seven subunits homologous to the bacterial complex, which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome in eucaryotes. Despite recent progress in structural knowledge, little is known about the electron pathway, the proton translocation mechanism, and the binding sites and mode of action of the large number of specific inhibitors of complex I. However, it seems inevitable to conclude from the available evidence that the proton translocating machinery resides largely in the membrane part, although all known prosthetic groups have been assigned to the peripheral part of the enzyme (13Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This has revived earlier ideas (14Suzuki H. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 352-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that a mechanism similar to the proton motive ubiquinone cycle operating in the cytochromebc 1 complex (15Brandt U. Trumpower B.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar) confers proton translocation in complex I (13Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1998; 1364: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These hypothetical mechanisms inherently predict that the hydrophobic part of complex I carries two or three independently operating reaction sites for ubiquinone. Many structurally diverse hydrophobic compounds have been described to inhibit complex I and are considered to interfere with ubiquinone reduction (12Ohnishi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 186-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 17Degli Esposti M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18Lümmen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies suggest that these inhibitors can be grouped into two (19Friedrich T. van Heek P. Leif H. Ohnishi T. Forche E. Kunze B. Jansen R. Trowitzsch-Kienast W. Höfle G. Reichenbach H.X. Weiss H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) or even three (20Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) classes, represented by piericidin A (class I/A-type), rotenone (class II/B-type), and capsaicin (C-type), respectively. It remains unclear, however, whether these classes in fact reflect three distinct inhibitor and quinone binding sites. Two different semiquinone species have been reported by EPR spectroscopy during the steady state reaction of complex I (21Vinogradov A.D. Sled V.D. Burbaev D.S. Grivennikova V.G.X. Moroz I.A. Ohnishi T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but there is still some controversy whether these reflect two ubiquinones or two forms of the same ubiquinone (22Albracht S.P.J. de Jong A.M.P.

Especially, because of their amphiphilic properties, ubiquinone and the inhibitors tend to accumulate in the small hydrophobic membrane phase so that the actual target site concentrations are very difficult to determine. This would be essential to calculate meaningful kinetic parameters. Therefore, we have developed two independent approaches to investigate equilibrium inhibitor binding to complex I. This allowed us to test directly if representative complex I inhibitors interact with each other at their cognate binding sites and how these binding sites relate to each other. All inhibitors were used as ethanolic stock solutions.

The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 10 mg/ml. Housefly SMP suspensions were solubilized by the addition of 4% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside and 150 mm KCl for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was partly delipidated on a Sephacryl S200 column (26 × 600 mm) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS at 4 °C. Fractions of the void volume showing n-decylubiquinone-dependent NADH oxidation were pooled and further purified on a Q-Sepharose column (26 × 100 mm) equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. Fractions exhibiting rotenone-sensitive NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity were pooled and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. We usedn-nonylubiquinone (NBQ) as a substrate for the determination of NADH:ubiquinone activity of SMP, which has been reported as one of the best ubiquinone-10 analogues for this purpose (25Degli Esposti M. Ngo A. McMullen G.L.X. Ghelli A.X. Sparla F. Benelli B. Ratta M.X. Linnane A.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Lenaz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). NBQ was prepared essentially following the protocol of Wan et al.(35Wan Y.-P. Williams R.H. Folkers K. Leung K.H. Racker E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Steady state activity was recorded in a Shimadzu UV-300 spectrophotometer as NADH oxidation at 340–400 nm (ε340–400 nm = 6.10 mm−1 × cm−1) using a thermostatted cuvette (30 °C) with a final volume of 1 ml. 100 μm NADH and 50 μg of SMP were added to buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 μmKresoxim-Methyl Brio® and 2 mm KCN. The catalytic reaction was started by the addition of 60 μmNBQ. Inhibitors were added to the cuvette before the addition of NBQ. Michaelis-Menten parameters were determined by varying the concentration of NADH or NBQ. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a SPEX Fluorolog 212 fluorometer attached to an AT-type personal computer. The fluorescence quench titrations (FQT) were performed and analyzed as described earlier (36Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by directly fitting the data to a formula derived directly from the standard binding equation. 2The formula used to analyze FQT is as follows. The observed fluorescence F obs during FQT is given by Fobs=(fbound−ffree)×Q−(Q2−ns×[Etot]×[Itot])+ffree×[Itot]Equation 1 with Q=12×([Itot]+Kd+ns×[Etot])Equation 2 and [Itot]=[Ibound]+[Ifree]Equation 3 where f bound andf free are the specific fluorescence of the bound and free inhibitor, [I tot],[I bound], and [I free] are the concentrations of total, bound, and free inhibitor, [E tot] is the total concentration of enzyme, and n s is the number of binding sites. DQA (ε291 nm = 8.14 mm−1 × cm−1 in ethanol) was automatically added to a stirred cuvette in 1-μl steps from a 15 μm stock solution in ethanol using a Hamilton Microlab M dispensor equipped with a 50-μl syringe. For FQT measurements, bovine SMP were diluted in N2-saturated buffer (2 mm KCN, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 2.5 μm Kresoxim-Methyl Brio®, 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) to 2.5 mg of protein/ml, corresponding to ∼1.5 μm cytochromec oxidase. Based on a complex I to cytochrome coxidase ratio of 1:10 in bovine SMP (37Kim S.J. Lee K.O. Takamiya S. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 38Cremona T. Kearney E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2328-2334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the complex I concentration was estimated at 0.15 μm or 0.06 nmol/mg of protein. Indirect determination of the dissociation constantK d for the binding of 5′-β-epirotenone by fluorescence quench titration was performed based on the standard binding equation (36Brandt U. von Jagow G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using the Psiplot software package version 4.61 (Poly Software International).

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was measured as follows. For saturation binding experiments, 3 μg of protein in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25% (w/v) CHAPS radioligand concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 100 nm were incubated at 22 °C in a sample volume of 100 μl. In competition experiments, the radioligand concentration was fixed at 6.5 nm, and variable concentrations of competing ligands were added. Unspecific binding was determined using 10 μm unlabeled rotenone or AE F119209, respectively. Methanol at a final concentration of 5% (v/v) in the assay mix was used to mediate the dissolution of radioligands and other inhibitors. After 20 min, 300 μl of 10 mg/ml dextran-coated charcoal (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, were mixed in thoroughly. The charcoal was sedimented by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 3 min. Protein-bound radioligand was measured in the supernatant by liquid scintillation counting. Data were analyzed by standard algorithms with either the EBDA (Biosoft, UK) or the SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) software package. The dissociation constant of complex I inhibitors that competed with equilibrium binding of radiolabeled AE F119209 and dihydrorotenone was determined by measuring the amount of bound radioligand in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled inhibitor. From the resulting logistic plots, apparent B50 values were determined as the concentration of competing inhibitor required to displace 50% of the radioligand. The apparent dissociation constants K dwere calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (42Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12266) Google Scholar, 43Weiland G.A. Molinoff P.B.

To test for the activity of complex I in our SMP preparation, we determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters for NADH and NBQ. The K m values were 3.9 ± 0.5 μm for NADH and 2.3 ± 0.2 μm for NBQ.V max was 1.16 ± 0.03 μmol of NADH × min−1 × mg−1 of protein.

Under these conditions, DQA binding was prevented by all inhibitors tested except by 5′-β-epirotenone and CC 44. In the case of 5′-β-epirotenone, an increase in apparent K d for DQA with increasing concentrations of competing inhibitor was observed and used to indirectly calculate the K d for this inhibitor.

According to the numerical fit of the data, fluorescence was quenched by 62 ± 3% upon binding, and the K d was 17 ± 3 nm(n = 15). The concentration of binding sites was found to be 0.15 ± 0.02 μm, which fits perfectly with one binding site per complex I and a ratio between cytochrome coxidase and complex I of 1:10 (37Kim S.J.

The results for all tested complex I inhibitors are summarized in Table I. Even the rather weak binding rotenone analogue 5′-β-epirotenone (I50 = 11 μm) shifted the apparent K d for DQA when added at concentrations between 1 and 100 μm. From these data aK d of 6 ± 2 μm(n = 7) for 5′-β-epirotenone was calculated. Only the capsaicin derivative CC 44 (28Satoh T. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) did not affect the FQT titration up to a concentration of 10 μm, indicating that it failed to specifically displace DQA. At higher concentrations of CC 44, the titrations were distorted and could not be fitted to the equation. However, this could not be because of specific displacement, as from an I50 of 80 nm for CC 44 (cf. Table I) one can predict that 10 μm CC 44 should have had a dramatic effect on the apparent K dfor DQA. This is also illustrated by the fact that at 10 μm even the two orders of magnitude weaker-binding 5′-β-epirotenone had a significant effect. Binding of the tritiated aminopyrimidine AE F119209 (Fig. 3) to the partially purified housefly complex I was found to be specific (90–95% specific binding) and saturable with an apparent dissociation constant of 9 nm as determined by Scatchard transformation of the data (Fig. 4). The maximum number of binding sites B max was 0.1 nmol/mg. Dihydrorotenone also exhibited saturable binding with an apparent K d of 30 nm and a B max of around 0.1 nmol/mg. The Scatchard plots (Fig. 4, inset) and Hill plots (not shown) indicated a homogeneous population of a single binding site for either ligand. Careful analysis of several independent experiments also gave no indication for two binding sites for dihydrorotenone or the aminopyrimidine, as it was not possible to fit the data to two components in any meaningful way.Figure 4Radioligand binding analysis of dihydrorotenone and AE F119209 to Musca complex I.

We examined the activities of 24 relevant compounds (2-arachidonoylglycerol, its structural analogues, and several synthetic cannabinoids). We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol is the most potent compound examined so far: its activity was detectable from as low as 0.3 nm, and the maximal response induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol exceeded the responses induced by others. Activities of HU-210 and CP55940, potent cannabinoid receptor agonists, were also detectable from as low as 0.3 nm, whereas the maximal responses induced by these compounds were low compared with 2-arachidonoylglycerol. Anandamide was also found to act as a partial agonist in this assay system. We confirmed that free arachidonic acid failed to elicit a response. Furthermore, we found that a metabolically stable ether-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol possesses appreciable agonistic activity, although its activity was apparently lower than that of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We also confirmed that pretreating cells with various cannabinoid receptor agonists nullified the response induced by 2-arachidonoylglycerol, whereas pretreating cells with other neurotransmitters or neuromodulators did not affect the response. These results strongly suggested that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is originally a 2-arachidonoylglycerol receptor, and 2-arachidonoylglycerol is the intrinsic physiological ligand for the cannabinoid CB1 receptor.

It is well known that Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), 1The abbreviations used are: Δ9-THC, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid. a psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, possesses a variety of pharmacological activities in vitro and in vivo(1$$Google Scholar), although, until recently, the mechanism of the action of Δ9-THC had long been unelucidated. In 1988, Devaneet al. (2Devane W.A. Dysarz III, F.A. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar) provided evidence that a specific binding site(s) for cannabinoids is present in the brain. Soon after, Matsuda et al. (3Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J.

These findings raised the possibility that at least part of the action of Δ9-THC is mediated through such a specific receptor and prompted the search for endogenous cannabinoid receptor ligands in mammalian tissues. In 1992, Devane et al. (4Devane W.A. Hanus L. Breuer A. Pertwee R.G. Stevenson L.A. Griffin Gibson D. Mandelbaum A. Etinger A. Mechoulam R.

Thus, the physiological significance or meaning of anandamide, especially in the brain, has been questioned recently despite its high binding affinity toward the cannabinoid receptor(s). On the other hand, several years ago, we found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol, an arachidonic acid-containing monoacylglycerol, possesses binding affinity toward the cannabinoid receptor in rat brain synaptosomes and that a rat brain contains a significant amount of arachidonoylglycerol (19Sugiura T.

Indeed, the level of arachidonoylglycerol in the brain was found to be 800 times higher than that of anandamide present in the same tissue (7Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Tonegawa T. Nakane S.

Moreover, in recent studies, we found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induces a rapid, transient elevation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) through a cannabinoid CB1 receptor-dependent mechanism and proposed that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is originally a 2-arachidonoylglycerol receptor (22Sugiura T.

Despite its possible physiological importance, however, the available information concerning this novel type of bioactive lipid is still limited. In addition, it is not clear whether or not 2-arachidonoylglycerol itself, but not its metabolites, is actually implicated in the observed biological effects, especially in cases of prolonged incubation of cells or in vivo experiments. In some cases, apparently, it is not easy to interpret the obtained experimental results because of the susceptibility of 2-arachidonoylglycerol to hydrolyzing enzymes, such as monoacylglycerol lipase. In this study, we examined the activities of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and its ether-linked metabolically stable analogues, as well as other structurally related compounds, to stimulate NG108–15 cells. We found that an ether-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, but not that of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol, exhibits appreciable cannabimimetic activity, although its activity was weak compared with that of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. The results obtained here provided strong evidence that the structure of 2-arachidonoylglycerol is strictly recognized by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. Arachidonic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid, eicosatrienoic acid (n-3 and n-6), eicosapentaenoic acid (n-3), docosatetraenoic acid (n-6), docosahexaenoic acid (n-3), l-glutamic acid, acetylcholine chloride, taurine, lysophosphatidic acid (1-oleoyl), prostaglandin E2, and essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. 1,3-Propanediol, hydroxyacetone, Fura-2/AM, glycerol, benzaldehyde, glycine, adenosine, adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP) disodium salt, dopamine hydrochloride, (R)-(−)-norepinephrine hydrogen tartrate, (R)-(−)-epinephrine, serotonin creatinine sulfate, histamine dihydrochloride, and butylated hydroxytoluene were obtained from Wako Pure Chem. Ind. (Osaka, Japan). Eicosatrienoic acid (n-9), eicosatetraynoic acid, and (R)-1-methanandamide were from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). SR141716A was acquired from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). CP55940 and HU-210 were purchased from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). (S)-(+)-2-Amino-1-propanol, (S)-(+)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol), and (R)-(−)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol (2,3-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol) were obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). WIN55212–2 and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were from Research Biochemicals (Natick, MA). Platelet-activating factor (1-hexadecyl) and bradykinin were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). [d-Ala2,d-Leu5]-enkephalin, dynorphin A, vasopressin, angiotensin II, substance P, substance K, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and neurotensin were purchased from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). 1,3-Benzylidene-sn-glycerol was prepared from glycerol and benzaldehyde using sulfosalicylic acid as a catalyst. Various types of fatty acid anhydrides were prepared from respective fatty acids by treatment with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 2-Acyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerol was synthesized from 1,3-benzylidenglycerol and fatty acid anhydrides using dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst; it was then purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.22). Purified 2-acyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerols were then treated with boric acid and boric acid trimethyl ester, at 85 °C under vacuum for 3 min, to yield 2-monoacylglycerols (34Martin J.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 5482-5483Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 2-Monoacylglycerols were purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (20:80:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.23). 2-Monoacylglycerols were further purified by boric acid-impregnated TLC using chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (98:2:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.61). In order to obtain 1-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol and 3-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol, 2,3-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol and 1,2-O-isopropylidene-sn-glycerol, respectively, were employed instead of 1,3-benzylidene-sn-glycerol. 3-Hydroxypropyl arachidonate (a 1,3-propanediol-type analogue of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol) was prepared from 1,3-propanediol and arachidonic anhydride using dimethylaminopyridine as a catalyst and purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (20:80:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.58). In order to prepare 2-hydroxypropyl arachidonate (a 1,2-propanediol-type analogue of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol), 2-oxopropyl arachidonate was prepared from hydroxyacetone and arachidonic anhydride and purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (65:35:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.41). The resultant 2-oxopropyl arachidonate was treated with NaBH4 to yield 2-hydroxypropyl arachidonate, which was purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (65:35:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.20). The structure of 2-hydroxypropyl arachidonate was confirmed by NMR and electron impact mass spectrometry. Anandamide was synthesized from arachidonic anhydride and ethanolamine and purified by TLC as described previously (7Sugiura T. Kondo S. Sukagawa A. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Yamashita A. Ishima Y. Waku K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). (S)-1-Methanandamide was synthesized from arachidonic anhydride and (S)-(+)-2-amino-1-propanol and purified by TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetone:acetic acid (30:40:20:1, v/v) as the solvent system (R F, 0.56). Arachidonic acid was dissolved in chilled, dehydrated diethyl ether and treated with LiAlH4 while stirring for 1 h under an atmosphere of argon to yield eicosatetraenol. After adding ethyl acetate to remove excess LiAlH4, the mixture was filtered through Celite and then washed, first with distilled water and next with saturated NaCl aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane:ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) as the elution solvent. Purified eicosatetraenol was then dissolved in dehydrated N,N-dimethylformamide and treated with methyltriphenoxyphosphonium iodide for 20 min to yield eicosatetraenyl iodide. Eicosatetraenyl iodide was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate, 20:2, v/v). 2-Eicosatetraenyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerol (an ether-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoyl-1,3-bezylideneglycerol) was obtained by condensing eicosatetraenyl iodide and 1,3-benzylideneglycerol using dimethylformamide as the solvent and Ag2O and tetra-n-butylammonium iodide as catalysts. After stirring at 90 °C for 6 h under argon, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and distilled water. The silver generated was removed by filtering through Celite, and the filtrate was washed, first with distilled water and then with saturated NaCl aqueous solution. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane:ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) as the elution solvent. 2-Eicosatetraenylglycerol (an ether-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol) was prepared from 2-eicosatetraenyl-1,3-benzylideneglycerol by treatment with boric acid and boric acid trimethyl ester, as in the preparation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. 2-Eicosatetraenylglycerol was purified by silica gel column chromatography and then by TLC using ethyl acetate as the solvent (R F, 0.48). To prepare 1(3)-eicosatetraenylglycerol,rac-1,2-O-isopropylideneglycerol was employed instead of 1,3-benzylideneglycerol. The structures of 2-eicosatetraenylglycerol and 1(3)-eicosatetraenylglycerol were confirmed by NMR and electron impact mass spectrometry. A methylene-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-hydroxymethyl-(allZ)-7,10,13,16-docosatetraen-1-ol) was prepared as follows: ethyl arachidonate was reduced with LiAlH4 in dry diethyl ether under the usual conditions in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant and in a nitrogen atmosphere. The product eicosatetraenol was isolated by silica gel column chromatography and converted to its p-toluenesulfonyl ester. The product, without purification, was iodinated with lithium iodide in dry acetone in the presence of butylated hydroxytoluene in the dark and under nitrogen (reflux for 14 h). The iodide was isolated by silica gel column chromatography using hexane:ethyl acetate (98:2, v/v) as the elution solvent and converted to a diethyl malonate derivative as follows: to a suspension of oil-free sodium hydride in a mixture of dry tetrahydrofuran and dry N,N-dimethylformamide, a solution of dry diethyl malonate was added dropwise in the same solvent mixture under nitrogen. After stirring for 15 min, the iodide solution previously described, containing a trace of butylated hydroxytoluene, was added dropwise under nitrogen. This reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h. The diethyl malonate derivative was isolated by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate, 98:2, v/v) and reduced in dry diethyl ether with LiAlH4 in a nitrogen atmosphere. The methylene-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol was obtained in a pure state after silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate, 7:3, v/v). The R F value for the methylene-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol in the TLC system using hexane:ethyl acetate (6:4, v/v) as the developing solvent was 0.15. The structure of the methylene-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol was confirmed by NMR. NG108–15 cells were kindly donated by Prof. H. Higashida (Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Kanazawa, Japan). NG108–15 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and a mixture of hypoxantine, aminopterine, and thymidine under an atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2. Subconfluent cells were further incubated in fresh medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h. The cells were next suspended by gentle pipetting in Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 3 μm Fura-2/AM and further incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were then centrifuged (180 × g for 5 min), washed twice with Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+), and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin. [Ca2+]iwas estimated using a CAF-100 Ca2+ analyzer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (22Sugiura T. Kodaka T. Kondo S. Tonegawa T. Nakane S. Kishimoto S. Yamashita A. Waku K. Biochem.

CaCl2 was added 4–5 min before the measurement (final Ca2+ concentration in the cuvette, 1 mm). 2-Arachidonoylglycerol and other related compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and aliquots (1 μl each) were added to the cuvette (final Me2SO concentration, 0.2%). Me2SO (final concentration, 0.4%) per se did not markedly affect the [Ca2+]i. In some experiments, cells suspended in 500 or 450 μl of Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin were pretreated with various types of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators (final concentration, 10 μm) or the vehicle alone (1 μl of Me2SO for various cannabinoid receptor agonists, platelet-activating factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and prostaglandin E2; 50 μl of Hepes-Tyrode's solution for other stimulants) at 37 °C for 1 min. Cells were then sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's solution (−Ca2+) containing 0.025% bovine serum albumin. After adding CaCl2 (final concentration, 1 mm), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (final concentration, 10 μm) was added to the cuvette, and the changes in [Ca2+]iwere analyzed. Conformational modeling was performed on a single molecule under vacuum with the QUANTA/CHARMm system (Micron Separations) using a dielectric constant, ε = 4r. Fig. 1 illustrates the chemical structures of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, its analogues, and related compounds, the biological activities of which were examined using NG108–15 neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid cells. Here, we examined whether or not these compounds are capable of inducing rapid transient increases in [Ca2+]i. The dose response curves of the 24 compounds tested are depicted in Fig.2. First, we examined the activity of 2-arachidonoylglycerol and confirmed that low concentrations of 2-arachidonoylglycerol elicit rapid transient increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2 A). The response was detectable from as low as 0.3 nm and was augmented with increased concentrations of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We also found that 1-arachidonoylglycerol and 3-arachidonoylglycerol, isomers of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, exhibited substantial activities (Fig. 2,B and C), although their activities were apparently lower than that of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. We confirmed that free arachidonic acid failed to induce a similar response, even at high concentrations (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2The activities of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, its structural analogues, and several synthetic cannabinoids to induce rapid, transient increases in [Ca2+]i in NG108–15 cells. Cells, loaded with Fura-2/AM, were stimulated with 2-arachidonoylglycerol or other compounds in the presence of CaCl2 (1 mm), and changes in [Ca2+]i were analyzed in CAF-100. The mean and S.D. were calculated from the results of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The activities of metabolically stable ether-linked analogues of arachidonoylglycerols were next examined. We found that 2-eicosatetraenylglycerol, an ether-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, possesses some agonistic activity (Fig.2 E), although its activity was markedly lower than that of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. The response was detectable from 30 nm, and the response induced by 10 μm2-eicosatetraenylglycerol was about 50% of that induced by 10 μm 2-arachidonoylglycerol. On the other hand, the activity of 1(3)-eicosatetraenylglycerol, an ether-linked analogue of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol, was very weak, compared with that of 2-eicosatetraenylglycerol, even at high doses, such as 10 μm (Fig. 2 F). Such preference of the 2-isomer over the 1(3)-isomer coincides well with the results of ester-linked compounds previously described (Fig. 2, A–C). We also found that another metabolically stable analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-hydroxymethyl-(allZ)-7,10,13,16-docosatetraen-1-ol (a methylene-linked analogue of 2-arachidonoylglycerol), lacked appreciable activity (Fig.2 G); this indicates that having an oxygen atom present in the linkage is important for agonistic activity. We then examined the activities of propanediol-type analogues of arachidonoylglycerols. We found that 2-hydroxypropyl arachidonate, one of two hydroxy groups lacking analogues of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol, possesses substantial agonistic activity (Fig. 2 H); its activity was almost comparable to that of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol. Interestingly, the activity of 3-hydroxypropyl arachidonate (Fig.2 I), another analogue of 1(3)-arachidonoylglycerol, was found to be much weaker than that of 2-hydroxypropyl arachidonate, suggesting that the presence of a free hydroxy group adjacent to the ester linkage is essential in exhibiting strong agonistic activity. Next, we examined the activities of anandamide and its analogues. As shown in Fig. 2 J, we confirmed that anandamide induces the elevation of [Ca2+]i. The response was detectable from as low as 3 nm, whereas the magnitude of the response induced by anandam"

Within the carboxyl-terminal residues of the RSK isozymes is a region of high conservation corresponding to residues<sup>722</sup>LAQRRVRKLPSTTL<sup>735</sup> in RSK1. Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 9 residues,<sup>727</sup>VRKLPSTTL<sup>735</sup>, completely eliminated the interaction of the GST-RSK1 fusion protein with purified recombinant ERK2, whereas the truncation of residues<sup>731</sup>PSTTL<sup>735</sup> had no effect on the interaction with purified ERK2. ERK1 and ERK2 co-immunoprecipitated with hemagglutinin-tagged wild type RSK2 (HA-RSK2) in BHK cell cytosol. However, ERK did not co-immunoprecipitate with HA-RSK2<sup>(1–729)</sup>, a mutant missing the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids, similar to the minimal truncation that eliminated <i>in vitro</i> interaction of ERK with the GST-RSK1 fusion protein. Kinase activity of HA-RSK2 increased 6-fold in response to insulin. HA-RSK2<sup>(1–729)</sup> had a similar basal kinase activity to that of HA-RSK2 but was not affected by insulin treatment. Immunoprecipitated HA-RSK2 and HA-RSK2<sup>(1–729)</sup> could be activated to the same extent <i>in vitro</i> by active ERK2, demonstrating that HA-RSK2<sup>(1–729)</sup> was properly folded. These data suggest that the conserved region of the RSK isozymes (<sup>722</sup>LAQRRVRKL<sup>730</sup> of RSK1) provides for a specific ERK docking site approximately 150 amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the nearest identified ERK phosphorylation site (Thr<sup>573</sup>). Complex formation between RSK and ERK is essential for the activation of RSK by ERK <i>in vivo</i>. Comparison of the docking site of RSK with the carboxyl-terminal tails of other MAPK-activated kinases reveals putative docking sites within each of these MAPK-targeted kinases.

https://openalex.org/W2011198909,"Selenoprotein P is an extracellular protein containing presumably 10 selenocysteines that are encoded by the UGA stop codon in the open reading frame of the mRNA. The function of selenoprotein P is currently unknown, although several indirect lines of evidence suggest that selenoprotein P is a free radical scavenger. We first developed a conventional procedure to isolate selenoprotein P from human plasma. Next, we investigated the reactivities of selenoprotein P against various hydroperoxides in the presence of glutathione. Although selenoprotein P reduces neither hydrogen peroxide nor tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, it does reduce phospholipid hydroperoxide such as 1-palmitoyl-2-(13-hydroperoxy-cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoyl)-3-phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide. Kinetic analysis demonstrated atert-uni ping-pong mechanism, similar to those described for classical glutathione peroxidase and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. Not only glutathione, but also dithiothreitol, mercaptoethanol, cysteine, and homocysteine, were effective as reducing substances, as in the case of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. These results show that selenoprotein P functions as a phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase in extracellular fluids."
https://openalex.org/W2040283697,"Partition modules stabilize bacterial plasmids and chromosomes by actively promoting their segregation into daughter cells. The partition module of plasmid P1 is typical and consists of a centromere site, parS , and genes that encode proteins ParA and ParB. We show that ParB can silence genes flanking parS (to which ParB binds), apparently by polymerizing along the DNA from a nucleation site at parS . Wild-type ParB contacts an extensive region of P1 DNA; silencing-defective ParB proteins, which were found to be partition-defective, are less able to spread. Hence, the silenced structure appears to function in partitioning."
https://openalex.org/W1985252933,"In addition to the Trk tyrosine kinase receptors, neurotrophins also bind to a second receptor, p75, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Several signaling pathways have been implicated for p75 in the absence of Trk receptors, including induction of NF-κB and c-Jun kinase activities and increased production of ceramide. However, to date, the mechanisms by which the p75 receptor initiates intracellular signal transduction have not been defined. Here we report a specific interaction between p75 and TRAF6 (tumor necrosis factorreceptor-associated factor-6) after transient transfection in HEK293T cells. The interaction was ligand-dependent and maximal at 100 ng/ml of nerve growth factor (NGF). Other neurotrophins also promoted the association of TRAF6 with p75 but to a lesser extent. The binding of TRAF6 was localized to the juxtamembrane region of p75 by co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. To assess the functional significance of this interaction, we have tested responses in cultured Schwann cells that express p75 and TRAF6. An NGF-mediated increase in the nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB could be blocked by the introduction of a dominant negative form of TRAF6 in Schwann cells.

The tobacco Nt-SYR1 gene encodes a syntaxin that is associated with the plasma membrane. Syntaxins and related SNARE proteins aid intracellular vesicle trafficking, fusion, and secretion. Disrupting Nt-Syr1 function by cleavage with Clostridium botulinum type C toxin or competition with a soluble fragment of Nt-Syr1 prevents potassium and chloride ion channel response to ABA in guard cells and implicates Nt-Syr1 in an ABA-signaling cascade."

Whereas the L29H/H64L double substitution retarded the reaction with H2O2, an 11-fold rate increase versus wild-type Mb was observed for the F43H/H64L mutant. The V max values for 1-electron oxidations by the myoglobins correlate well with the varied reactivities with H2O2. The functions of the distal histidine as a general acid-base catalyst were examined based on the reactions with cumene hydroperoxide and cyanide, and only the histidine in F43H/H64L Mb was suggested to facilitate heterolysis of the peroxide bond. The x-ray crystal structures of the mutants confirmed that the distal histidines in F43H/H64L Mb and peroxidase are similar in distance from the heme iron, whereas the distal histidine in L29H/H64L Mb is located too far to enhance heterolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2053129975,"We showed recently that a targeted null mutation in the murine sterol carrier protein 2-/sterol carrier protein x-gene (Scp2) leads to defective peroxisomal catabolism of 3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic acid (phytanic acid), peroxisome proliferation, hypolipidemia, and enhanced hepatic expression of several genes that have been demonstrated to be transcriptionally regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα). As a broad range of fatty acids activates PPARα in vitro, we examined whether the latter effects could be because of phytanic acid-induced activation of this transcription factor. Dietary phytol supplementation was used to modulate the concentration of phytanic acid in C57Bl/6 and Scp2 (−/−) mice. We found that the serum concentrations of phytanic acid correlated well with the expression of genes encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes and liver fatty acid-binding protein, which have all been demonstrated to contain functionally active peroxisome proliferator response elements in their promoter regions. In accordance with these findings, a stimulating effect on acyl-CoA oxidase gene expression was also observed after incubation of the rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1 with phytanic acid. Moreover, reporter gene studies revealed that phytanic acid induces the expression of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven chloramphenicol transferase reporter gene comparable with strong peroxisome proliferators. In addition, the ability of phytanic acid to act as an inductor of PPARα-dependent gene expression corresponded with high affinity binding of this dietary branched chain fatty acid to recombinant PPARα. We conclude that phytanic acid can be considered as a bona fide physiological ligand of murine PPARα.

As a broad range of fatty acids activates PPARα in vitro, we examined whether the latter effects could be because of phytanic acid-induced activation of this transcription factor. Dietary phytol supplementation was used to modulate the concentration of phytanic acid in C57Bl/6 and Scp2 (−/−) mice. We found that the serum concentrations of phytanic acid correlated well with the expression of genes encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes and liver fatty acid-binding protein, which have all been demonstrated to contain functionally active peroxisome proliferator response elements in their promoter regions. In accordance with these findings, a stimulating effect on acyl-CoA oxidase gene expression was also observed after incubation of the rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1 with phytanic acid. Moreover, reporter gene studies revealed that phytanic acid induces the expression of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven chloramphenicol transferase reporter gene comparable with strong peroxisome proliferators. In addition, the ability of phytanic acid to act as an inductor of PPARα-dependent gene expression corresponded with high affinity binding of this dietary branched chain fatty acid to recombinant PPARα. We conclude that phytanic acid can be considered as a bona fide physiological ligand of murine PPARα. Apart from serving as fuels in energy metabolism, fatty acids have been proposed to act as regulators in gene expression (reviewed in Ref.1Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 335-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Important roles in this process have been assigned to heterodimers consisting of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) 1The abbreviations used are: PPARα, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α; mPPARα, murine PPARα; RXRα, retinoid X receptor α; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator response element; SCP2, sterol carrier protein 2; SCPx, sterol carrier protein x; ACO, acyl-CoA oxidase; CAT, chloramphenicol transferase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LBD, ligand binding domain; 9-cis RA, 9-cis retinoic acid. and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), both of which are members of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors that function as ligand-dependent transcription factors (2Kliewer S.A.

RXRα/PPARα heterodimers alter the transcription of target genes after binding to PPREs, which consist of a degenerate direct repeat of the recognition motif TGACCT spaced by 1 nucleotide (also called DR1 element) (2Kliewer S.A.

Functionally active PPREs have been identified within the control regions of various genes implicated in lipid metabolism (overview in Ref. 6Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). The finding that several endogenous unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, arachidonic acid, or linoleic acid activate PPARα in vitrosupports the assumption that fatty acids could represent biological ligands for this nuclear hormone receptor (3Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that fatty acids regulate the transcription of genes involved in their own degradation by activating PPARα (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a great number of chemically diverse peroxisome proliferators activate PPARα to a similar or even higher extent than all natural fatty acids, implying that the specificity of the fatty acid-mediated effect on PPARα may be low (9Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Kliewer S.A. Sunseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J.

Therefore, it cannot be excluded that these agonists exert their effects indirectly by either being metabolized in the cell to an active form or by inducing the release or synthesis of a common endogenous ligand (9Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Kliewer S.A. Sunseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J.

Sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) and sterol carrier protein x (SCPx) are two peroxisomal proteins that are generated from the same gene via alternative transcription initiation (11Ohba T. Holt J.A. Billheimer J.T. Strauss J.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10660-10668Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on in vitrodata, it was assumed that SCP2 may play a role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking (reviewed in Ref. 12Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), whereas SCPx was identified as peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase with intrinsic lipid transfer activity (13Seedorf U. Brysch P. Engel T. Schrage K. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21277-21283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the phenotype of the SCP2/SCPx knockout mouse, Scp2 (−/−), did not provide evidence for a role of the gene in intracellular cholesterol trafficking but revealed instead defective peroxisomal degradation of certain natural methyl-branched fatty acyl-CoAs such as phytanic and pristanic acid, which are metabolized in peroxisomes. The metabolic abnormalities were associated with marked peroxisome proliferation, hypolipidemia, and enhanced expression of genes encoding peroxisomal β oxidation enzymes (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made after feeding mice with fibrates (6Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar,15Dwivedi R.S. Alvares K. Nemali M.R. Subbarao V. Reddy M.K. Usman M.I. Rademaker A.W. Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. Toxicol. Pathol. 1989; 17: 16-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the analysis of the PPARα knockout mice indicated that the fibrates exert their effects through PPARα (16Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), we investigated whether phytanic acid could act as a fibrate-like natural agonist of PPARα. Phytanic acid was also identified as a weak agonist of RXRα, the obligate heterodimerization partner of PPARα (17Lemotte P.K. Keidel S. Apfel C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Kitareewan S. Burka L.T. Tomer K.B. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Stevens R.D. Forman B.M. Mais D.E. Heyman R.A. McMorris T. Weinberger C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined if the altered hepatic gene expression in our transgenic model could be because of phytanic acid-induced activation of RXRα. A synergistic effect on gene expression in the presence of ligands for both nuclear receptors has previously been described to occur in vitro (19Berthou L. Saladin R. Yagoob P. Branellac D. Calder P. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. Auwerx J. Staels B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Schlenius A.K. Wigren J. Backstrom K. Andersson K. DePierre J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results reveal a strong correlation between phytanic acid serum concentrations and expression of genes encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes (acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme, peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase), and liver fatty acid-binding protein. In addition, we demonstrate that phytanic acid does not only bind to recombinant PPARα but also induces the expression of a PPRE-driven CAT reporter gene comparable with strong peroxisome proliferators. The identification of phytanic acid as a bona fide physiological ligand of PPARα is of special interest, as an accumulation of this dietary fatty acid is not only observed in Scp2 (−/−) mice but also in several inherited human diseases,e.g. Refsum disease and Zellweger syndrome (21Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2351-2370Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues or MH1C1 cells according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (22Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) followed by selection of poly(A)+ RNA on oligo(dT) cellulose. Northern blots were hybridized with digoxigenin-labeled probes prepared by random priming using a commercially available kit (Boehringer Mannheim). All probes were obtained from a mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) by polymerase chain reaction amplification with appropriate primers. Quantification was carried out relative to expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The membranes were rinsed twice in 0.1% SDS, 2× SSC (0.15 mNaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) at room temperature and then twice in 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC at 68 °C for 15 min. Bands were visualized using the chemiluminescence substrate CDP-Star (Tropix-Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) and quantified using a Bio-Imager BAS-KR 1500 (Fuji, Düsseldorf, Germany). DNA sequencing was performed on an automated laser fluorescence DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to verify the identity of the polymerase chain reaction amplification products. The rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1 was obtained from the DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 72 h with 250 μm Wy 14,643, bezafibrate, or phytanic acid dissolved in Me2SO (0.5% v/v). Wy 14,643 was obtained from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), and bezafibrate and phytanic acid were obtained from Sigma. HepG2 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% basal medium supplement artificial serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and grown to 70% confluency. Co-transfection of HepG2 cells with 1.5 μg/well pcDNA3-mPPARα (5Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar, 23Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1993; 11: 433-439Crossref Scopus (804) Google Scholar) and 1.5 μg of pCAT-iPPRE was performed with Fugene transfection reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). pcDNA3-mPPARα was a friendly gift from Dr. P. Holden (Zeneca), and the reporter gene construct pCAT-iPPRE was prepared by cloning the previously identified “ideal” PPRE sequence 5′-tgtgacctttgacctagttttg-3′ (24Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) into plasmid pCAT3 (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfection with 0.5 μg/well pSV-β-Gal (Promega) was performed as the internal control. After transfection, cells were incubated for 42 h with 200 μm indicated compound, dissolved in 1% Me2SO (arachidonic acid, 100 μm). CAT and β-galactosidase concentrations were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Normalized CAT expression was determined and plotted as fold induction relative to untreated cells. Each experiment was performed six times with similar results. The ligand binding domain of mPPARα was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a murine liver cDNA library with a 5′ primer that introduced an EcoRI site and a 3′ primer that introduced a BamHI site downstream of the natural stop codon of mPPARα cDNA. The resulting fragment was appropriately digested and subcloned into a EcoRI/BamHI-digested GST fusion vector (pGEX-2T, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST/LBD-mPPARα expression in Escherichia coli strain XL-1-Blue (Stratagene) was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-b-d-galactopyranoside to the growth media (0.2 mm final concentration). After culturing for 5 h, bacterial extracts were prepared by sonication (50 W, 2 × 20 s) followed by 5 freeze/thaw cycles. The fusion protein was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mice were fed a standard chow diet (Altrumin, Hannover, Germany) containing 0.8 mg/g (w/w) of various sterols, mainly cholesterol and β-sitosterol, 0.075 mg/g (w/w) of nonesterified phytol, and 0.2 mg/g (w/w) of phytanic acid. Phytol-enriched diets were prepared from these diets by adding 5 mg/g of phytol (Aldrich). Bezafibrate was added to the standard diet at a concentration of 2.5 mg/g, treatment with 9-cis RA was performed by daily gavage of 10 μg of 9-cis RA (Sigma)/g of body weight. Animals were kept individually, and food intake and body weights were monitored daily. Ligand binding to recombinant GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein was performed with the fluorescent fatty acid trans-parinaric acid (25Frolov A. Cho T.H. Billheimer J.T. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31878-31884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Xu Z. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7885-7892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of trans-parinaric acid in absolute ethanol was determined spectrophotometrically (ε310 = 84,000m−1). Protein solution (0.1 to 0.4 μm in phosphate-buffered saline) was titrated withtrans-parinaric acid at 25 °C using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LS 50 B, Perkin-Elmer). For excitation and emission, wavelengths of 320 and 412 nm and a slit width of 2.5 and 20 nm were used. Ethanol concentration never exceeded 1% (v/v). All binding experiments were performed at least four times, and the dilution was subtracted from original data. The binding isotherms were fitted using a nonlinear Marquardt algorithm. For competition experiments, GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein (0.1 to 0.4 μm in phosphate-buffered saline) was saturated withtrans-parinaric acid, which was then displaced from the protein using various ligands dissolved in ethanol (80 to 100 μm). We demonstrated recently that the loss of the Scp2 gene function led to drastically elevated phytanic acid serum concentrations accompanied by peroxisome proliferation, hypolipidemia, impaired body weight control, neuropathy, and markedly altered hepatic gene expression (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To characterize in more detail the impact of the gene disruption on modulation of hepatic gene expression, we exposed C75Bl/6 and Scp2 (−/−) mice to a standard laboratory chow diet (low phytol diet) and to a diet supplemented with 5 mg/g of nonesterified phytol (high phytol diet). Phytol is rapidly converted into phytanic acid in both strains of mice (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Effects on hepatic gene expression were evaluated by Northern blot analyses with liver RNA isolated from the four groups: low phytol C57Bl/6, low phytol Scp2 (−/−), high phytol C57Bl/6, and high phytol Scp2 (−/−). We selected to study four genes that comprise functionally active PPREs: ACO (23Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1993; 11: 433-439Crossref Scopus (804) Google Scholar), peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme (27Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Zhang B. Subramani S. Rachubinski S. Capone J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5723-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (28Hijikata M. Wen J.K. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and liver fatty acid-binding protein (29Issemann I. Prince R. Tugwood J. Green J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, expression of all of these genes was induced considerably in the two high phytol groups. Lowest expression was consistently seen in the low phytol C57Bl/6 group, followed by the low phytol Scp2 (−/−) group (1.5-to 3-fold higher) and the high phytol C57Bl/6 group (3- to 7-fold higher). The most drastic induction was evident in the high phytol Scp2 (−/−) group in whom expression was between five- (liver fatty acid-binding protein) and more than 10-fold (peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme) higher than in the low phytol C57Bl/6 group. Thus, hepatic expression of PPARα target genes seemed to parallel phytanic acid serum concentrations (Fig. 1 B). To exclude hormonal or strain-specific influences on PPARα-dependent gene expression (30Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lemberger T. Saladin R. Vazquez M. Assimacopoulos F. Staels B. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether phytanic acid could also induce the expression of target genes in a cell culture model. Therefore, we incubated the rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1 with phytanic acid and examined ACO mRNA expression by Northern blot analyses. MH1C1 cells have previously been shown to retain the ability of peroxisome proliferation in response to nafenopin and to express significant amounts of PPARα (32Brocard C. Es-Souni M. Ramirez L.C. Latruffe N. Bournot P. Biol. Cell. 1993; 77: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In accordance with our in vivo findings in Scp2 (−/−) mice, we found a 3- to 4-fold elevated ACO mRNA expression after incubation of MH1C1 cells with 250 μm phytanic acid for 3 days (Fig. 2). The increase on ACO mRNA expression was more pronounced than that obtained after incubation of this cell line with 250 μm bezafibrate (2- to 3-fold) but less prominent than that obtained with 250 μm Wy 14,643 (4- to 5-fold) (Fig. 2). To gain further insights into the mechanism of phytol-induced modulation of gene expression, we treated Scp2 (−/−) and C57Bl/6 mice with bezafibrate and 9-cis RA and compared ACO gene expression in their livers with the corresponding effects of dietary phytol administration. Bezafibrate has been demonstrated to be an activator of PPARα (9Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), whereas 9-cis RA was identified as a weak activator of RXRα (17Lemotte P.K. Keidel S. Apfel C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Kitareewan S. Burka L.T. Tomer K.B. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Stevens R.D. Forman B.M. Mais D.E. Heyman R.A. McMorris T. Weinberger C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As evident from Fig.3, treatment of Scp2 (−/−) and control mice with 9-cis RA alone stimulated ACO gene expression only very moderately, leading to a 1.5-fold increase that was not statistically significant. Most efficient stimulation of ACO gene expression was observed in Scp2 (−/−) mice that had been treated with either phytol or bezafibrate (Fig. 3). However the simultaneous administration of 9-cis RA and bezafibrate to Scp2 (−/−) and control mice did not lead to a synergistically enhanced ACO gene expression that was observed in rat hepatocyte cultures (19Berthou L. Saladin R. Yagoob P. Branellac D. Calder P. Fruchart J.C. Denefle P. Auwerx J. Staels B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 20Schlenius A.K. Wigren J. Backstrom K. Andersson K. DePierre J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These results pointed to similarities that seemed to exist between the effects of dietary phytol intake and treatment with bezafibrate. The good correlation between plasma phytanic acid concentrations and expression of PPARα target genes led to our hypothesis that this fatty acid may act as a direct agonist of PPARα, especially as it has been demonstrated that a broad range of fatty acids binds to and thereby activates this transcription factor (3Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). To evaluate this hypothesis, we tested binding of phytanic acid to a recombinant glutathione-S-transferase/murine PPARα ligand binding domain fusion protein (GST/LBD-mPPARα) and compared its affinity with a number of well characterized PPARα activators. We used a fluorescence binding assay in which increasing concentrations oftrans-parinaric acid were incubated with a constant amount of GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein. The assay takes advantage of the known fact that binding of trans-parinaric acid to proteins changes its spectral properties, leading to sensitized fluorescence with a maximum at a wavelength of 412 nm (excitation at 320 nm) (24Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). As is evident from Fig. 4 A, saturable binding of trans-parinaric acid to the purified GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein could be demonstrated. In contrast,trans-parinaric acid did not bind to purified recombinant GST, thus excluding the possibility that the GST part of the fusion protein contributed significantly to the binding activity (26Sha R.S.

To compare the binding affinities of several known PPARα activators with that of phytanic acid, we performed competition experiments. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Wy 14,643 revealed the best displacement of trans-parinaric acid from GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein and thus the highest binding affinity. Surprisingly, the natural branched chain fatty acid phytanic acid bound to recombinant mPPARα far better than the well known PPARα activators bezafibrate, arachidonic acid, and palmitic acid (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 9Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar,10Kliewer S.A. Sunseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisley G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W.

A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), we observed no displacement of trans-parinaric acid from GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein after adding this very long chain fatty acid and, thus, no binding. The ability of phytanic acid to induce the expression of a CAT reporter gene linked to a PPRE was examined by co-transfection of HepG2 cells with a mPPARα-expressing plasmid (5Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3047) Google Scholar, 23Tugwood J.D. Issemann I. Anderson R.G. Bundell K.R. McPheat W.L. Green S. EMBO J. 1993; 11: 433-439Crossref Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The addition of PPARα ligands to the culture medium at a concentration of 200 μm (arachidonic acid, 100 μm) revealed a strong correlation between the binding affinity of the compounds toward mPPARα and their respective trans-activation ability. The administration of Wy 14,643 led to a 10-fold increase in CAT expression, followed by phytanic acid (6.5-fold), bezafibrate (4.0-fold), arachidonic acid (3.1-fold), and palmitic acid (2.2-fold) (Fig. 5). Therefore, phytanic acid is not only a high affinity ligand but also a potent activator of murine PPARα. In a previous study, we demonstrated that Scp2 (−/−) mice had a defect in peroxisomal catabolism of phytanoyl-CoA (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The data pointed to a dual role played by the two Scp2-encoded gene products, SCP2 and SCPx, which are both localized in peroxisomes as follows. 1) Reduced peroxisomal phytanoyl-CoA import seemed to relate to the absence of phytanoyl-CoA carrier function that was shown to be associated with SCP2. 2) Defective thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketopristanoyl-CoA was apparently because of absence of the 3-ketopristanoyl-CoA thiolase activity that was shown to be associated with SCPx (13Seedorf U.

In addition to the metabolic defect, we observed profound peroxisome proliferation, hypolipidemia, and increased expression of genes encoding proteins that function in peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present work was to characterize the latter effects of the gene disruption in more detail. In vitro data published earlier (17Lemotte P.K. Keidel S. Apfel C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Kitareewan S. Burka L.T. Tomer K.B. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Stevens R.D. Forman B.M. Mais D.E. Heyman R.A. McMorris T. Weinberger C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) showed that phytanic acid behaves like a weak activating ligand of RXRα and thus may act as 9-cis RA-like agonist when present in high concentrations. Because RXRα is an obligatory partner in PPRE-dependent gene expression (2Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar, 3Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), we initially considered that the effects on gene expression in Scp2 (−/−) mice were because of enhanced activation of RXRα in this transgenic model. However, the evidence that we present in the current manuscript does not support this hypothesis, as follows. 1) Application of 9-cis RA to control mice did not induce ACO gene expression, although 9-cis RA has been demonstrated to be a more potent activator of RXRα than phytanic acid. 2) Application of the RXRα agonist 9-cis RA to both strains of mice did not evoke hypotriglyceridemia or peroxisome proliferation, 2U. Seedorf, unpublished observation. which were observed in Scp2 (−/−) mice, especially after feeding the phytanic acid precursor phytol. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the effects observed in Scp2 (−/−) mice are because of phytanic acid-induced activation of RXRα. Because a broad range of fatty acids has been shown to activate PPARαin vitro (3Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the enhanced hepatic gene expression in our mouse model could be because of the phytanic acid-induced activation of PPARα. It has been demonstrated that ligand binding to PPARα induces a conformational change that enables the protein to interfere with basal transcription machinery (35Dowell P. Peterson V.J. Zabriskie T.M. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2013-2020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The DNA binding affinity of PPARα is also enhanced in the presence of ligands, at least if the receptor concentration is limiting (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Therefore, ligand binding is a necessary prerequisite for the activation of PPARα-dependent gene expression. We measured the ability of phytanic acid and several well known PPARα activators to bind to a recombinant GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein. So far, ligands of murine and Xenopus PPARα have been primarily identified by indirect binding assays, in which the ligand-dependent DNA binding activity of PPARα (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) or the ligand-induced activation of coactivator proteins (9Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar) were measured.K d-values have only been reported for the few cases in which radiolabeled ligands were available (10Kliewer S.A. Sunseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisley G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar). Thetrans-parinaric acid competition assay that we used in the present study allowed us to identify direct binding of ligands to the soluble GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein. Furthermore, actualK d-values for the ligands could be obtained using a Marquardt algorithm. For Wy 14,643, a K d value of 4 nm was calculated, followed by phytanic acid (10 nm), bezafibrate (45 nm), arachidonic acid (83 nm), and palmitic acid (100 nm). The affinities for straight chain fatty acids in binding to PPARα were found in the range of their respective physiological serum concentrations (∼30 μm) (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 10Kliewer S.A. Sunseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisley G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Because phytanic acid bound to the recombinant GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein with at least one order of magnitude higher affinity than palmitic acid, one might consider that this dietary fatty acid also binds within its physiological serum concentration range (1.3–6.5 μm) (17Lemotte P.K. Keidel S. Apfel C.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The direct binding of phytanic acid to recombinant PPARα supports the assumption that PPARα activation is not necessarily achieved by a common endogenous ligand that mediates the effects of the structural diverse PPARα activators. The binding affinities of the compounds toward the recombinant GST/LBD-mPPARα fusion protein corresponded well with their trans-activation ability, obtained by co-transfection of a PPRE-driven CAT reporter gene and a mPPARα-expressing plasmid into HepG2 cells. In addition, the extent of induction of acyl-CoA oxidase mRNA expression in MH1C1 cells was also consistent with the trans-activation ability of the compounds. For several reasons, the identification of phytanic acid as a PPARα agonist is of special interest. First, phytanic acid does not only accumulate in Scp2 (−/−) mice but also in several inherited human diseases like Refsum disease and Zellweger syndrome (21Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2351-2370Google Scholar). Although remarkable differences were observed in the ligand binding affinities between rodent and human PPARα (37Keller H. Devchand P.R. Perroud M. Wahli W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 651-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we found that phytanic acid binds to recombinant human PPARα with a comparable affinity as to murine PPARα. 3C. Wolfrum, unpublished observation. Second, phytanic acid is the first identified natural PPARα ligand that is primarily degraded in peroxisomes (21Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2351-2370Google Scholar, 38Singh H. Beckman K. Poulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9514-9520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, a variety of endogenous fatty acids have been described as PPARα activators without being substrates for peroxisomal degradation. On the other hand, very long chain fatty acids that are primarily degraded by peroxisomal β-oxidation neither bind to nor activate PPARα (7Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Therefore, one might consider that phytanic acid induces its own degradation via activation of the PPARα-dependent peroxisomal oxidation pathways. However, because of its β-methyl group, phytanic acid cannot be degraded by β-oxidation. Instead, a one carbon moiety is split from the molecule by α-oxidation, yielding pristanic, which is then subjected to six cycles of peroxisomal β-oxidation (21Steinberg D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2351-2370Google Scholar, 39Verhoeven N.M. Schor D.S. Ten Brink H.J. Wanders R.J. Jakobs C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 66-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the expression of the key step enzyme in phytanic acid α-oxidation, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, is not increased in Scp2 (−/−) mice, although the serum phytanic acid concentrations increases up to 1000-fold after phytol feeding (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This leads to the conclusion that the initial step in phytanic acid degradation is not regulated by the substrate concentration. Instead, we consider that phytanic acid serves as a dietary signal molecule that induces the catabolism of fatty acids by activating PPARα. This assumption is supported by the recent finding that PPARα also modulates constitutive expression of genes encoding several mitochondrial fatty acid-catabolizing enzymes (40Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The dietary uptake of physiological concentrations of phytanic acid together with a bulk of other fatty acids would lead to an enhanced mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation because of the activation of PPARα. This is in accordance with our previous findings, which in addition to the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes, the expression of mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase mRNA as well as enzymatic activity of mitochondrial butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase is drastically enhanced in the liver of Scp2 (−/−) mice (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The phytanic acid-induced expression of genes encoding mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes might also explain the observed hypolipidemia in Scp2 (−/−) mice (14Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W.A. Wanders R.J.A. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Therefore, phytanic acid could serve as a dietary signal leading to the induction of fatty acid catabolism. We thank P. R.

These reactions are catalyzed by GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), a monomeric enzyme with two catalytic activities. Two genes encoding NDST isozymes have been described, one from rat liver (NDST1) and another from murine mastocytoma (NDST2). Both isozymes are expressed in tissues in varying amounts, but their relative contribution to heparan sulfate formation in any one tissue is unknown. We now report the identification of a third member of the NDST family, designated NDST3. A full-length cDNA clone (3.2 kilobase pairs) encoding a 873-amino acid protein was obtained from a human fetal/infant brain cDNA library. Human NDST3 (hNDST3) has a nucleotide sequence homologous but not identical to hNDST1 and NDST2. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 70% and 65% amino acid identity to that of hNDST1 and NDST2, respectively. A soluble chimera of hNDST3 and protein A exhibited bothN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity, confirming its enzymatic identity. Northern blot analysis of human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA showed a single transcript of 6.4 kilobase pairs. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed more restricted tissue expression of hNDST3 than hNDST1 and NDST2, and high levels in brain, liver, and kidney. Analysis of Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed expression of NDST1 and NDST2, but not NDST3. In a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant exhibiting reduced N-sulfotransferase activity and reduced sulfation of heparan sulfate (Bame, K. J., and Esko, J. D. (1989)J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8059–8065), expression of NDST1 was greatly reduced, but NDST2 was expressed normally, suggesting that both enzymes are involved in heparan sulfate assembly.

Heparan sulfate and heparin are large complex carbohydrate chains that interact with various proteins (e.g. basic fibroblast growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, antithrombin, and lipoprotein lipase) through unique oligosaccharide sequences.

The assembly of these sequences occurs by the concerted action of various enzymes that act in three stages: 1) chain initiation and assembly of the linkage tetrasaccharide GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ1- on serine residues of core protein, 2) chain elongation in which the disaccharide repeat unit of GlcAβ1,4GlcNAcα1,4- are assembled, and 3) chain modification in which N-deacetylation/ N-sulfation of subsets of GlcNAc residues occurs, followed by C5-epimerization of GlcA tol-IdoA, 2-O-sulfation of the uronic acid residues, and 6-O- and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues. GlcNAc N-deacetylation andN-sulfation are prerequisite for all of the other modifications and are catalyzed by a single-chain polypeptide, called GlcNAc N-deacetylase/ N-sulfotransferase (NDST) 2A consensus regarding the abbreviation for the proteoglycan N-sulfotransferases was reached at a recent meeting on proteoglycans.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and another from mouse mastocytoma (NDST2, Refs. 7Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human counterparts of NDST1 and NDST2 have been reported, and their chromosomal location was mapped at 5q32–33.1 and 10q22, respectively (11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Both isozymes are expressed in tissues to varying extents (10Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem.

J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but their relative contribution to heparan sulfate formation in any one tissue is still unclear. In this report, we describe the identification of a new member of the NDST gene family, designated NDST3. hNDST3 exhibited both tissue-specific expression and enzymatic activities, confirming its identity as a GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase and suggesting that it functions as an active NDST enzyme in specific tissues in vivo. In addition, expression of the NDST gene family was examined in CHO cells and a mutant, pgsE-606, which exhibited undersulfated heparan sulfate and reduced N-sulfotransferase activity (13Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Reddy R.V. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12461-12468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that both NDST1 and NDST2 participate in heparan sulfate formation in CHO cells. Identification of EST clones that encoded a new member of NDST was performed essentially according to Veugelerset al. (17Veugelers M. Vermeesch J. Reekmans G. Steinfeld R. Marynen P. David G. Genomics. 1997; 40: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, five clones were found to be similar but not identical to hNDST1 and NDST2 (GenBank accession nos. U36600and U36601, respectively) by searching the GenBank EST data base using the nucleotide sequence of hNDST1 (11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Dixon J. Loftus S.K. Gladwin A.J. Scambler P.J. Wasmuth J.J. Dixon M.J.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). One EST clone (ID 47106), whose terminal sequences were reported as H11065 and H11153, was obtained from Genome System, Inc. The nucleotide sequence was determined using an ABI 373 DNA sequencer with the cycle-sequencing method. The obtained sequence corresponded to the nucleotides 877–3188 of the full-length cDNA sequence. 5′-RACE was performed using an adapter-ligated library of human fetal brain cDNA (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cDNA was first amplified using a primer consisting of nucleotides 1538–1564 (NDST3-HGSP5, 5′-gggctgcatatggctccacatgtgagg-3′) and anchor primer 1, according to the touch-down PCR protocol (30 cycles) using AdvantageTaq (CLONTECH). An aliquot (1/250) of the first PCR was subjected to nested PCR (20 cycles) using nucleotides 1132–1158 (NDST3-HGSP7, 5′-gcacctttagagatggaaggagaaagg-3′), and anchor primer 2, followed by a second nested PCR (20 cycles) using nucleotides 1120–1147 (NDST3-HGSP6, 5′-gatggaaggagaaaggttttctggggtc-3′) and anchor primer 2. Southern hybridization was performed using a32P-labeled DNA fragment representing nucleotides 936–1556 as a probe. The DNA fragment was gel-purified and cloned into vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequence was determined, and nucleotides 9–931 were further confirmed by analyzing DNA fragments representing nucleotides 9 -387 and 366–387 prepared by PCR (40–60 cycles with primers NDST3-AF (5′-ttggcgacgggtcttgcatgtg-3′, nucleotide 9–30) and NDST3-AR (5′-caactatgccaacagaagcacc-3′, nucleotide 366–387) or NDST3-BF (5′-gaaaagtagctggaacaccatc-3′, nucleotide 303–324) and NDST3-CR (5′-ctgaaagctctgtacactcttc-3′, nucleotide 910–931), respectively, and Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The fragments were amplified from the initial library. Human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA was obtained fromCLONTECH. Northern hybridization was performed using ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) essentially according to manufacturer's protocol. A 32P-labeled DNA fragment (nucleotides 1–1147) was used as a probe. The hybridized band was detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Normalized cDNA was obtained from CLONTECH (Human cDNA panel I and a fetal cDNA panel). PCR was performed as described above using 32 cycles for hNDST3 and 27 cycles for hNDST1 and NDST2. For the specific amplification of each NDST, six gene-specific primers were used: hNDST3–1F (5′-caggaaaatgaactctctgagacgg-3′) and hNDST3–1R (5′-agatggaaggagaaaggttttctgg-3′) for hNDST3 (nucleotides 518–542 and 1124–1148 in AF074924, respectively); hNDST1–1F (5′-accacagccagactgaacgtttgtg-3′) and hNDST1–1R(5′-acagggaaatgtccagtctgtctcc-3′) for hNDST1 (nucleotides 3081–3105 and 3499–3523 in U36600, respectively); and hNDST2–1F (5′-ttccagtctgggctgatgtcccagc-3′) and hNDST2–1R (5′-gtagatcccactgcctggctaaagg-3′) for hNDST2 (nucleotides 2664–2688 and 3065–3089 in U36601, respectively). Each set of oligonucleotides was unique to each NDST isozyme, as determined by the program, Amplify. The product was analyzed by 1.2% TAE-agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Culturing of wild-type CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61) and the N-sulfotransferase-deficient mutant, pgsE-606, were described previously (13Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNA was prepared using Fast Track 2.0 (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed into single-strand cDNA using the Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A reaction without reverse transcriptase served as a negative control. PCR analysis (27 cycles for NDST1 and NDST2, 30 cycles for NDST3) was then performed for hamster NDST1 (nucleotides 3104–3544 of rNDST1, M92042) using mNDST1–1F (5′-accacagccagccagaacgcttgtg-3′) and mNDST1–1R (5′-agctgcgctcctctcccttactgtc-3′), NDST2 (nucleotides 3142–3570 of mNDST2, U02304) using mNDST2–1F (5′-tgcaacattccagtgtgggctgatggc-3′) and mNDST2–1R (5′-atgacattagagaggccaggccacagg-3′), and NDST3 (nucleotides 251–609 of hNDST3, AF074924) using mNDST3–2F (5′-tgtgtttcctgtgagtccagatgtgtg-3′) and NDST3–2R (5′-attgtcctcctcacttccatcagcctg-3′). 3These primers were based on mouse genomic sequence homologous to hNDST3 cDNA (J. Aikawa and J. D. Esko, unpublished results). Since PCR with this set of primers using mouse brain cDNA as a template produced the 359-bp DNA fragment predicted from the genomic information, the use of this set of primers in PCR should be able to amplify a part of the Chinese hamster NDST3 cDNA. A soluble form of hNDST3 corresponding to amino acid residues 48–873 was fused at its N terminus to a portion of protein A essentially according to Wei et al. (6Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the chimera in COS7 cells was achieved with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. After 72 h of incubation, cell culture supernatant was recovered and the chimera was collected on IgG-agarose essentially according to Wei et al. (6Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, a portion of the supernatant (10 ml) was mixed with a suspension (100 μl) of rabbit IgG-agarose (Sigma) and rotated end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice with 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.4) and then suspended in buffer A (200 μl). An aliquot (20 μl) was used for the assay of both N-deacetylase andN-sulfotransferase activity, using [3H-acetyl]heparosan or de-N-sulfoheparin as a substrate, as described previously (14Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bame K.J. Reddy R.V. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12461-12468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]Heparin purified by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (14Bame K.J. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10287-10293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was treated with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 (20Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and analyzed by gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography using a TSK G2000SW column (7.5 × 300 mm, LKB) as described by Bameet al. (13Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific degradation at N-sulfated glucosamine residues by nitrous acid treatment was monitored by counting of radioactivity in each fraction. Searching the EST data base using the nucleotide sequences homologous to human NDST1 identified five non-identical EST clones. One was derived from human infant brain (GenBank accession nos. H11065–H11153), two from fetal spleen and liver (AA011263–AA011344 and R07738–R07739) and two from Jurkat lymphoma cells (AA353878 and AA354508). One clone from human infant brain was selected for full sequencing, since it contained the longest 5′-sequence (Fig. 1). The open reading frame was composed of 714 amino acids with a termination codon (TAG) located similarly to that found in hNDST1 and hNDST2, but it lacked sequence homologous to the N termini of hNDST1 and hNDST2. We therefore prepared the 5′-portion of this clone using 5′-RACE. After two rounds of nested PCR, DNA fragments were obtained that hybridized to a probe containing the 5′-portion of clone 47106. pCR15–1 had the longest insert (1147 bp), and its nucleotide sequence was analyzed (Fig. 1). The sequence of nucleotides 9–931 was further confirmed by using DNA fragments prepared by PCR using high fidelity DNA polymerase (Fig. 1) (see “Materials and Methods”). The combined nucleotide sequence of the EST clone and the 5′ RACE product showed an open reading frame of 2619 nucleotides with 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of 403 and 163 nucleotides, respectively. The open reading frame corresponded to 873 amino acid residues. The primary structure of this polypeptide showed a type II transmembrane protein, with 23 amino acids tentatively identified as the transmembrane domain by hydropathy analysis (Fig.2, underlined sequence) and a 13-residue cytoplasmic domain.Figure 2Homology of amino acid sequence of hNDST gene family. The amino acid sequences of human forms of the three NDSTs are aligned. Identical amino acids are marked with dots. Gaps indicated by dashes were introduced to maximize the alignment. Putative transmembrane regions toward the N termini areunderlined, and the domains suggested to define the PAPS binding site are indicated by the double underline.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Alignment of this protein with hNDST1 and hNDST2 revealed significant sequence similarities, exhibiting 70% and 65% amino acid identity and 86% and 82% similarity to human NDST1 and NDST2, respectively (10Kusche-Gullberg M.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We therefore designated this protein NDST3, a tentative third member of the heparan sulfate/heparin GlcNAcN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase family of genes. To test if NDST3 had GlcNAcN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities, a soluble form of hNDST3 fused to protein A was constructed and expressed in COS7 cells. A fusion protein was detected in the conditioned medium by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a 130-kDa polypeptide, the same size as a chimera of rat NDST1 (data not shown; Ref. 6Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The fusion protein immobilized on IgG-agarose was tested for enzyme activity. As shown in Fig.3, protein A-fused hNDST3 exhibited bothN-deacetylation and N-sulfation activities. When compared with a comparable construct prepared from rNDST1, the new isozyme had 53% and 62% of the respective activities found in a preparation of the recombinant NDST1. The ratio ofN-deacetylase to N-sulfotransferase activities was more like that found in NDST1 (∼1:1) than in NDST2 (∼5:1, Ref.9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2270-2276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the reaction was N-sulfated glucosamine based on nitrous acid treatment at low pH (20Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Northern blot analysis of human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA revealed a single transcript of approximately 6.4 kb for hNDST3 (Fig. 4). The same size transcript was detected in Jurkat cells (data not shown). The expression of hNDST genes was next examined in various tissues using RT-PCR with normalized first-strand cDNA (see “Materials and Methods”). Each PCR yielded a single product with predicted nucleotide lengths of 633, 445, and 428 bp for hNDST3, hNDST1, and hNDST2, respectively (Fig. 5). Expression of hNDST3 was detected in greatest abundance in brain, kidney, liver, and lung of both adult and fetal tissues, adult pancreas and placenta, and fetal spleen and thymus. Expression was not detected in adult/fetal heart and skeletal muscle. On the other hand, expression of hNDST1 and hNDST2 was detected in all the tissues tested, although expression of hNDST1 in adult/fetal skeletal muscle and fetal thymus and hNDST2 in adult skeletal muscle was very low.Figure 5Expression of NDST family genes in human adult and fetal tissues.

To test this idea, we examined the expression of the three isozymes in wild-type CHO cells and a mutant (pgsE-606) previously shown to be partially defective in N-sulfation of heparan sulfate (13Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for rodent NDST1, NDST2, and NDST3 were designed on the basis of rNDST1, mNDST2, and hNDST3 cDNAs. NDST1 and NDST2 derived oligonucleotides amplified specific PCR products in CHO cells (443 and 431 bp, respectively, Fig.6), but NDST3 did not, even after increasing the number of cycles. RT-PCR analysis of the mutant showed that NDST1 message was much reduced, but normal levels of NDST2 mRNA was present (Fig. 5). This mutant was previously shown to have about 30–40% of wild-type levels of N-sulfotransferase activity and a corresponding decrease in N-sulfation of the chains. These results suggest that the decrease in enzyme activity is most likely due to loss of NDST1 and that the residual sulfation observed in the mutant was due to expression of NDST2. The present study describes a new human cDNA clone forN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase that resembles NDST1 and NDST2. Two independent findings indicate that this protein encodes a new member of NDST gene family. First, the amino acid sequence showed 65–70% identity and greater than 85% overall homology to the other NDST isozymes. Its structure was a typical type II transmembrane protein, like other Golgi enzymes. Second, production of a protein A-chimera lacking the putative transmembrane domain, but containing the presumptive ectodomain exhibited bothN-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity with relative activities similar to rat NDST1. Therefore, we propose to designate this gene product NDST3, and assign it as the third member of heparan sulfate/heparinN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase family. The amino acid sequence of hNDST3 except for the most N-terminal 79 amino acids exhibited significant similarity to that of hNDST1 and hNDST2 (74% and 69%, respectively), suggesting that this region directly contributes to enzyme activity. In addition, Shworak et al. (21Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. Logeart D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28008-28019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have pointed out the similarity between the C-terminal 260 amino acids of NDST1 and NDST2 and the glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase (GlcN 3OST1) involved in the formation of the antithrombin binding sequence in heparan sulfate and heparin. Since the homologous region represents ∼85% of the entire sequence of GlcN 3OST, this region in NDST could reasonably constitute the actual catalytic domain, or at least a binding site for the heparan sulfate chain. Recent analysis of PAPS binding domains in various sulfotransferases indicates a consensus binding site in theN-sulfotransferases consisting of two domains (Fig.7). NDST3 contains these consensus sequences, as well. In addition, Berninsone and Hirschberg recently showed that the C-terminal half of NDST2 (amino acids 479–880) was able to catalyze the N-sulfation of glucosamine of heparan sulfate (22Berninsone P. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25556-25559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most N-terminal 79 amino acid residues are completely different among three NDST isozymes (Fig. 2). In NDST3, this region contains a 13-amino acid cytoplasmic segment, a 23-amino acid transmembrane domain, and an additional 43-amino acids, which may represent a Golgi lumenal stem region by analogy to other Golgi proteins. This region might be critical for the correct localization of this enzyme (23Shaper J.H. Shaper N.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 701-709Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the case of α2,6-sialyltransferase, which exhibits the same type II transmembrane topology and resides in thetrans-Golgi and trans-Golgi network, its transmembrane and lumenal stem region are required for the correct localization (24Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Humphries et al. have suggested that human NDST1 was in trans-Golgi network (11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the location of NDST2 and NDST3 have not been investigated yet. Northern hybridization revealed an hNDST3 transcript of 6.4 kb in both fetal brain tissue and Jurkat cells. This differs from NDST1 (8.5–8.0 and 4.2–4.0 kb) (4Hashimoto Y. Orellana A. Gil G. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15744-15750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and NDST2 (4.0–3.8 kb) (7Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that this transcript is unique to NDST3. A typical polyadenylation signal was not identified in this study. The difference in size of the message and the cDNA clone (3.2 kb) suggest that hNDST3 transcript has an additional ∼3 kb of 3′-untranslated portion which was missed in our study. The transcript for NDST1 and NDST2 was detected in all human adult tissues tested, consistent with previous findings (11Humphries D.E. Sullivan B.M. Aleixo M.D. Stow J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12Humphries D.E. Lanciotti J. Karlinsky J.B. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the expression of NDST1 and NDST2 in liver was different in human and mouse. In mouse liver, abundant message for NDST1 was detected, although NDST2 was not (7Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we have detected expression of both NDST1 and NDST2 message in human liver, and their amounts were almost the same. Furthermore, NDST3 is expressed at high levels in human liver. Further study will be required to determine if these transcripts are expressed in the same cell types to the same extent in different species. Previously, it was proposed that NDST2 was involved in biosynthesis of heparin rather than heparan sulfate, because the enzyme exhibited a higher ratio of N-deacetylase toN-sulfotransferase activity than NDST1 (7Eriksson I. Sandbäck D. Ek B. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10438-10443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, its transcript was abundant in murine mastocytoma that produces heparin, and overexpression of the enzyme in a human kidney cell line resulted in enhanced N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of heparan sulfate (25Cheung W.F. Eriksson I. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Kjellén L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5250-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, in this study, we showed that NDST2 was widely distributed in human tissues in agreement with the high frequency of human EST clones (33 human EST clones were found in various tissues including breast, infant brain, and fetal lung and heart). 4At the day of submission of this paper, 5 mouse and 2 rat EST clones of NDST2 were also found. A total of 26 human, 8 mouse, and 1 rat EST clones have been reported for NDST1. The tissues tested in this study do not produce heparin, but make various amounts of heparan sulfate (26Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 322: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), suggesting that NDST2 may play a role in heparan sulfate synthesis as well. Support for this hypothesis derives from our study of CHO cell mutant pgsE-606, which was originally shown to contain a defect in NDST prior to the discovery of multiple isozymes in the system. This strain exhibits about a 3-fold reduction in sulfation of heparan sulfate and a comparable change in NDST activity. Analysis of NDST transcripts in CHO cells indicates that the wild-type expresses both NDST1 and NDST2, but not NDST3, consistent with the more restricted pattern of expression of the third isozyme. Analysis of the mutant showed that it contains very little transcript for NDST1 (the PCR was adjusted to detect even minute amounts of message), and normal amounts of NDST2 (which under these conditions exceeded the linearity of the measurement). Thus, the residual sulfation of the chains in the mutant most likely arises from the action of NDST2. Inspection of the pattern of sulfation of heparan sulfate in the mutant showed that the loss of enzyme activity decreased the overall sulfation of the chains and reduced the size of the modified sections of the chains. Thus, the data suggest that NDST1 actually works in concert with NDST2 to generate the fully expanded modified tracts characteristic of wild-type CHO cell heparan sulfates. The detection of a third NDST isoform (NDST3) indicates that the assembly of heparan sulfate and possibly heparin may reflect the concerted action of multiple isozymes expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Further analysis of the involvement of each isozyme in the formation of heparan sulfate will require new tools including better defined substrates to assess the effects of prior modification on further deacetylation and sulfation. Resolving the contribution of each isozyme will ultimately depend on the generation of additional mutant cell lines, transgenesis experiments, and the derivation of mice altered in one or more NDST genes.

In HEK293 cells expressing recombinant receptors, directional migration toward appropriate agonist ligands requires release of free G protein βγ subunits and can be triggered by agonists for receptors coupled to Gi but not by agonists for receptors coupled to two other G proteins, Gs and Gq. Because activation of any G protein presumably releases free Gβγ, we tested the hypothesis that chemotaxis also requires activated α subunits (Gαi) of Gi proteins. HEK293 cells were stably cotransfected with the Gi-coupled receptor for interleukin-8, CXCR1, and with a chimeric Gα, Gαqz5, which resembles Gαi in susceptibility to activation by Gi-coupled receptors but cannot regulate the Gαi effector, adenylyl cyclase. These cells, unlike cells expressing CXCR1 alone, migrated toward interleukin-8 even after treatment with pertussis toxin, which prevents activation of endogenous Gαi but not that of Gαqz5. We infer that chemotaxis does not require activation of Gαi. Because chemotaxis is mediated by Gβγ subunits released when Gi-coupled receptors activate Gαqz5, but not when Gq- or Gs-coupled receptors activate their respective G proteins, we propose that Gi-coupled receptors transmit a necessary chemotactic signal that is independent of Gαi.

As it migrates to a site of infection or tissue injury, an inflammatory cell must detect a chemokine gradient and organize its cytoskeleton to move in the right direction (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev.

Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways responsible for this complex cellular response are poorly understood. Pertussis toxin, which specifically prevents receptor-dependent activation of Gi proteins, blocks chemotactic migration of neutrophils; we therefore infer that Gi proteins play essential roles in mediating the chemotactic signal. Activation of G proteins by serpentine receptors releases two potential stimulators of downstream signals, an α subunit (Gα), bound to GTP, and a free Gβγ subunit (5Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). For example, the αi subunits of Gi proteins directly mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while the βγ subunits of these proteins mediate opening of K+ channels and stimulation of phospholipase Cβ (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar).To identify the G protein subunit that mediates chemotaxis, we have begun to study chemotaxis in a cell line, HEK293, 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonal kidney; IL-8, interleukin 8; CXCR1, interleukin 8 receptor type A; m3AChR, m3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein receptor kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonal kidney; IL-8, interleukin 8; CXCR1, interleukin 8 receptor type A; m3AChR, m3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein receptor kinase.which is amenable to stable transfection with normal and mutant receptors and other signaling proteins. Endogenous Gα subunits of HEK293 cells include αs, αq, αi1, αi2, and αi3, but not αo or αz (7Law S.F. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10721-10727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lounsbury K.M. Schlegel B. Poncz M. Brass L.F. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3494-3498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this model we found that chemotaxis requires receptors that activate Gi and that release of free βγ is essential (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Receptors that activate two other G proteins, Gs and Gq, could not mediate chemotaxis in HEK293 cells. Abundant evidence indicates that activation of these two G proteins, like that of Gi, involves dissociation of Gβγ from GTP-bound Gα. Accordingly, it is reasonable to ask why the Gβγ released from αs·GTP or αq·GTP could not mimic the chemotactic effect of Gβγ released from αi·GTP.One answer is that Gαi itself makes the difference, by activating an essential downstream signal distinct from those triggered by Gβγ. A second possibility is that Giproteins are simply more abundant than Gs or Gq, and accordingly release more Gβγ upon activation. A third possibility is that inhibitory signals generated by the α subunits of Gs or Gq block the chemotactic response to free βγ. To test these possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, we assessed chemotaxis of HEK293 cells expressing different combinations of receptors and Gα proteins. Our results show that chemotaxis requires a receptor that can activate Gibut does not require Gαi itself. We propose that chemotaxis requires not only Gβγ, but also a signaling function of Gi-coupled receptors that is distinct from activation of Gαi.RESULTSAbundant evidence indicates that receptor activation of all trimeric G proteins causes dissociation of Gβγ from Gα·GTP. If so, why does receptor activation of Gi elicit chemotaxis, but release of Gβγ from activated Gq or Gsdoes not (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)? One trivial explanation is that the second messengers synthesized in response to activation of Gs and Gq actually inhibit the chemotactic response that would otherwise be elicited by release of Gβγ. Fig.1 shows that this explanation could account for the failure of activated Gs, but not that of activated Gq, to mediate chemotaxis. Forskolin, which reproduces the stimulation of cAMP accumulation that would result from activation of Gαs, completely inhibited the chemotactic response to IL-8 in HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant IL-8 receptor, CXCR1 (Fig. 1 A); this result is in accord with previous observations (13Harvath L. Robbins J.D. Russell A.A. Seamon K.B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 224-232PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dai Y. Holgate S.T. Church M.K. Shute J.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 15Elferink J.G.R. VanUffelen B.E. Gen. Pharmacol. 1996; 27: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that cAMP inhibits the chemotactic response of neutrophils and other cells. To test whether activated Gαq can inhibit chemotaxis, we cotransfected cells expressing recombinant CXCR1 with a cDNA (10Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9667-9675Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) encoding mutationally activated Gαq (Gαq-Q205L). Expression of Gαq-Q205L increased basal phosphoinositide accumulation more than 30-fold (result not shown), but had no effect whatever on chemotaxis toward IL-8 (Fig. 1 B).If activated Gαq cannot inhibit chemotaxis, we must ask why the release of Gβγ from receptor-activated Gq does not mediate chemotaxis. The simplest explanation would be that chemotaxis requires Gαi·GTP, as well as Gβγ. Accordingly, we asked whether CXCR1 can elicit chemotaxis when it activates a G protein containing a chimeric Gα, Gαqz5(11Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), which cannot regulate activity of a direct effector of Gαi, adenylyl cyclase. Gαqz5 is identical to Gαq except that its C-terminal five amino acids are replaced by the corresponding sequence of Gαz, a Gα that responds to stimulation by Gi-coupled receptors but is not inhibited by treatment with pertussis toxin (16Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant Gαz with CXCR1 conferred on the cells the ability to migrate toward IL-8 even after treatment with pertussis toxin (result not shown); this result did not speak to the question of whether αi is required for chemotaxis, however, because Gαz can mimic the inhibitory effect of Gαion adenylyl cyclase (16Wong Y.H. Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Science. 1992; 255: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar).We have shown that ligand-bound Gi-coupled receptors can use Gαqz5 to activate the phosphoinositide pathway usually regulated by Gαq (11Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells that co-expressed Gαqz5 and CXCR1 migrated toward IL-8 (Fig.2 A). Chemotaxis was mediated by a G protein containing Gαqz5, rather than by endogenous Gi, as shown by the inability of pertussis toxin to prevent chemotaxis of Gαqz5-expressing cells; the toxin completely blocked chemotaxis toward IL-8 in control cells expressing CXCR1 alone (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Effect of overexpressed Gαqz5 on chemotactic and second messenger responses to IL-8. A and B. Migration assays were performed as described (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were incubated without (filled squares,panel B) or with (other symbols, panels A and B) 500 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed and assayed as described. C, accumulation of of inositol phosphates in response to the indicated concentrations of IL-8 was measured. CXCR1 alone, diamonds; CXCR1 plus Gαqz5, squares.

Values represent the mean ± S.E. of six determinations for panels A andB and three determinations for panels C and D. Similar results were obtained in three or more independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This result strongly suggests that chemotaxis in HEK293 cells does not require activated Gαi, although it does require activation of a Gi-coupled receptor. Controls indicated that IL-8 did indeed activate Gαqz5, but not Gαi. In Gαqz5-expressing cells, the chemokine stimulated accumulation of phosphoinositides, even after treatment with pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, the chemokine inhibited cAMP accumulation in the same cells only if they had not been treated with pertussis toxin (Fig. 2 D),i.e. only when endogenous Gi was accessible to activation by CXCR1.We considered a potential quantitative explanation for the previously reported (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) failure of a Gq-coupled receptor, the m3AChR, to mediate chemotaxis in HEK293 cells. Although the cellular content of Gαq in HEK293 cells is unknown, it is probably lower than that of the exogenous Gαqz5 stably expressed in these cells. Thus, it is possible that activation of Gq does release Gβγ, but that the amount of membrane-bound Gαq·βγ available for receptor activation in cells transfected only with the m3AChR cDNA, unlike the presumably larger amount of Gαqz5·βγ in transfected cells, cannot release sufficient amounts of Gβγ in response to receptor stimulation.To test this possibility, we increased the amount of available Gαq by stably transfecting a cDNA encoding recombinant Gαq into HEK293 cells already expressing the m3AChR. Carbachol, the m3AChR ligand, failed to elicit chemotaxis even in the doubly transfected cells (Fig.3 A). The negative inference, that a Gq-coupled receptor cannot elicit chemotaxis, was supported by control observations (Fig. 3, B andC) indicating that recombinant Gαq was indeed overexpressed and responsive to receptor stimulation in these cells. Thus, expression of exogenous Gαq allowed greater agonist-stimulated accumulation of phosphoinositides than that observed either in cells expressing the m3AChR alone or in pertussis-toxin treated cells expressing Gαqz5 and CXCR1 (Fig.3 B). Moreover, recombinant Gαq and Gαqz5 were expressed to nearly identical extents in the two types of cell (Fig. 3 C), as indicated by immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies against epitopes inserted into both Gα proteins.Figure 3Chemotaxis and signaling in cells overexpressing the m3AChR ± wild type Gαq. A, migration assays were performed on cells expressing CXCR1 alone (filled squares), the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, type 3 (m3AChR, abbreviated MR3) alone (open triangles), or the m3AChR plus wild type Gαq (filled triangles).

Lysates were undiluted (—) or diluted 1:2 or 1:4, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The failure of CXCR1 alone to mediate activation of phosphoinositide accumulation by IL-8 (Fig. 2 C) is consistent with results of a previous study (17Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), in which recombinant CXCR1 was found to activate some but not all members of the αq family,i.e. IL-8 stimulated phospholipase C in CXCR1-expressing COS-7 cells if they coexpressed α14, α15, or α16, but did not do so in cells expressing CXCR1 alone or in combination with αq or α11. In the same study (17Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), CXCR1 mediated Gi- and Gβγ-dependent activation of phospholipase C, but only in the presence of the β2 isoform of the phospholipase. In view of this latter result, we suspect that HEK293 cells lack the β2 isoform of the enzyme, because CXCR1 alone does not stimulate phosphoinositide accumulation in these cells (Fig. 2 C).DISCUSSIONOur experiments with HEK293 cells pose an intriguing twofold paradox. First, as reported earlier (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), liberation of Gβγ from Gαβγ is required for chemotaxis of these cells; nonetheless, even though activation of any trimeric G protein releases Gβγ, receptors that activate G proteins other than Gi do not mediate chemotaxis. Second, even though receptors coupled to Gi are required to mediate chemotaxis of these cells, signaling by Gαi itself is not required, at least in HEK293 cells. Here we discuss four speculative ways to resolve these paradoxes: Gi-coupled receptors may activate a specific subset of Gβγ isoforms, may generate a Gαi-independent signal in addition to Gβγ, may be susceptible to novel regulatory controls, or may promote co-localization in the plasma membrane of appropriate effectors with the Gβγ liberated by receptor activation. These explanations are not mutually exclusive.By choosing among polypeptides encoded by five Gβ and 11 Gγ genes, mammalian cells could express many different Gβγ isoforms (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Does a specific Gβγ isoform mediate chemotaxis? If so, the responsible Gβγ dimer must possess specificity not only for a subset of G protein coupled receptors but also for the specific downstream effector(s) of chemotaxis. In both respects the evidence from other G protein-mediated signaling pathways is inconclusive. Receptors can select among Gβ and Gγ isoforms in vitro (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar) and in regulating neuronal Ca2+ channels of intact cells (18Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 19Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Shared specificity for one Gβγ isoform has not been reported, however, for any group of G protein-coupled receptors, including those that couple to Gi. With respect to effectors, circumstantial evidence implicates Gγ2 as an essential component of Gi-mediated stimulation of phospholipase Cβ in differentiated HL60 cells (20Iiri T. Homma Y. Ohoka Y. Robishaw J.D. Katada T. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5901-5908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and γ5 and γ12 are reported to colocalize in cultured cells with vinculin and F actin, respectively (21Ueda H. Saga S. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Kato K. Asano T. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1503-1511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, experiments in several laboratories have failed to show significant specificity of any Gβγ dimer, except for the relative weakness of those containing Gγ1 for stimulating any effector (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 22Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Simon M.I. Robishaw J.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23409-23417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Logothetis D.E. Kim D.H. Northup J.K. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5814-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).Does chemotaxis require a receptor to generate a third kind of signal, independent of Gαi and in addition to the signal(s) relayed by free Gβγ? G protein receptor kinases (GRKs) and arrestins, two potential candidates for generators of such a signal, are involved in agonist-dependent desensitization and endocytosis of receptors. In a Gβγ-dependent fashion, GRKs bind to and are activated by agonist-stimulated receptors; activated GRKs phosphorylate residues on the cytoplasmic face of receptors (24Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar) and could, hypothetically, phosphorylate downstream effectors. Receptor phosphorylation by GRKs markedly enhances agonist-dependent association of receptors with arrestins, which act negatively, by competing with G proteins, to damp receptor signaling (25Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Arrestins also mediate association of receptors with other proteins, including components of the endocytotic machinery of clathrin-coated pits (26Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). This more positive role of arrestins could serve as an analog for association with and activation of a hypothetical downstream effector of chemotaxis. No member of either the GRK or the arrestin families, however, has yet been reported to interact specifically with chemotactic or Gi-coupled receptors.One piece of evidence indirectly suggests that chemotactic receptors may generate a signal separate from those mediated by Gαiand Gβγ; a C-terminal truncation of CXCR1 markedly inhibited the chemotactic response but did not alter the receptor's ability to trigger agonist-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), responses mediated by Gαi·GTP and Gβγ, respectively (5Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 27Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). C-terminal tails of receptors are implicated as sites that contribute to binding of GRKs and arrestins, and might very well bind to other target molecules as well (25Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 1095-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar).A third possibility is that, rather than generating a signal distinct from those mediated by Gαi and Gβγ, chemotactic Gi-coupled receptors are susceptible to a kind of regulatory control that does affect other receptors. For example, we could imagine that signaling by these receptors is enhanced or attenuated by a molecule that accumulates asymmetrically at the front or the back, respectively, of a cell migrating up a gradient of chemoattractant.A fourth speculation, perhaps the most interesting, could resolve the paradox created by dependence of chemotaxis on Gi-coupled receptors and Gβγ, but not Gαi. In this scenario, the Gi-coupled receptor promotes liberation of Gβγ in microdomains of the cell that contain critical downstream effectors of chemotaxis; the receptor could do so by associating with a scaffolding protein that sequesters effectors of chemotaxis in a signaling complex. The chemotrophic pheromone response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae furnishes a relevant precedent: Gβγ mediates this response by promoting formation of a signaling complex assembled by a scaffolding protein, STE5p (28Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Other data raise the possibility that G protein-coupled receptors participate in signaling complexes containing both G protein subunits and effectors. For example, experiments in a reconstituted system using pure receptor, effector, and G protein suggest that all three components participate in a membrane-bound functional complex: phospholipase Cβ, the effector of Gαq·GTP, accelerates receptor-stimulated exchange of GTP for GDP bound to Gαq (29Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Similarly, a recently identified scaffold protein, inaD, assembles downstream proteins involved in G protein-dependent phototransduction (including a phospholipase C) at specific subcellular locations in the retina of fruit flies (30Tsunoda S. Sierralta J. Sun Y. Bodner R. Suzuki E. Becker A. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1997; 388: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Note that formation of the postulated chemotaxis signaling complex might depend on both the activated receptor and Gβγ. In this regard, protein domains located in the third intracellular loops (ic3 domains) of m2- and m3-muscarinic receptors associate with free Gβγ (but not with Gβγ complexed to Gα·GDP) and Gβγ and the ic3 domain appear to form a ternary complex with a receptor kinase, GRK2 (31Wu G. Benovic J.L. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7197-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The unusually large ic3 domains of muscarinic receptors may be analogs of the hypothetical scaffolding proteins that associate with Gi-coupled receptors.This fourth proposal for resolving the paradox raises an interesting question. Do all Gi-coupled receptors share the proposed ability of chemotactic receptors to organize signaling complexes that are required for chemotaxis? We and others have tested several Gi-coupled receptors, not previously identified as “professional” chemotactic receptors, for ability to mediate directional migration of cultured cells toward the appropriate ligand; the D2 dopamine receptor and the μ- and δ-opioid receptors do mediate chemotaxis, albeit not as efficiently as CXCR1 (9Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether this result can be generalized to include all, or even most, Gi-coupled receptors.The paradox we have described is paralleled, nonetheless, by similar paradoxes in two other responses to agonists for Gi-coupled receptors: stimulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and opening of K+ channels. Even though Gβγ (but not Gαi·GTP) mediates both responses, neither response is elicited by the Gβγ liberated by activating receptors that activate G proteins other than Gi (32Dascal N. Cell.

Possible resolutions of these paradoxes include those we have outlined for resolving the paradox in chemotactic signaling.Finally, our findings in HEK293 cells provide a starting point for dissecting the molecular basis of chemotactic signaling in neutrophils and other professionally chemotactic cells. Gi-coupled receptors and G protein subunits can serve as probes for identifying the critical but so far elusive effectors that harness the actin cytoskeleton to effect directional migration. As it migrates to a site of infection or tissue injury, an inflammatory cell must detect a chemokine gradient and organize its cytoskeleton to move in the right direction (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 2Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev.

Pertussis toxin, which specifically prevents receptor-dependent activation of Gi proteins, blocks chemotactic migration of neutrophils; we therefore infer that Gi proteins play essential roles in mediating the chemotactic signal. Activation of G proteins by serpentine receptors releases two potential stimulators of downstream signals, an α subunit (Gα), bound to GTP, and a free Gβγ subunit (5Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). For example, the αi subunits of Gi proteins directly mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while the βγ subunits of these proteins mediate opening of K+ channels and stimulation of phospholipase Cβ (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). To identify the G protein subunit that mediates chemotaxis, we have begun to study chemotaxis in a cell line, HEK293, 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonal kidney; IL-8, interleukin 8; CXCR1, interleukin 8 receptor type A; m3AChR, m3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein receptor kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonal kidney; IL-8, interleukin 8; CXCR1, interleukin 8 receptor type A; m3AChR, m3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; GRK, G protein receptor kinase.which is amenable to stable transfection with normal and mutant receptors and other signaling proteins. Endogenous Gα subunits of HEK293 cells include αs, αq, αi1, αi2, and αi3, but not αo or αz (7Law S.F. Yasuda K. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol.

In general, stress stimuli strongly activate the p38s and the JNKs while only weakly activatingERK1 and ERK2. However, a number of independent groups have now shown that the RAF/ERK signaling pathway is strongly activated by ionizing radiation. In this work, we examine this paradox. We show that both mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) and MAP kinase kinase 2 (MEK2) are activated by ionizing radiation. Blockage of this activation through the use of dominant negative MEK2 increases sensitivity of the cell to ionizing radiation and decreases the ability of a cell to recover from the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint arrest. Blocking MEK2 activation does not affect double-strand DNA break repair, however. Although MEK1 is activated to a lesser extent by ionizing radiation, expression of a dominant negative MEK1 does not affect radiation sensitivity of the cell, the G2/M checkpoint of the cell, or double-strand break repair. Because ionizing radiation leads to a different cell cycle arrest (G2/M arrest) than that typically seen with other stress stimuli, and because we have shown that MEK2 can affect G2/M checkpoint kinetics, these results provide an explanation for the observation that the MEKs can be strongly activated by ionizing radiation and only weakly activated by other stressful stimuli.

A number of cancer predisposition genes and oncogenes exert their effects through the cell signaling pathways initiated by dsbs. For example, the cancer predisposition genes ATM and DNA-PK are kinases that are activated by dsbs. Cells with mutations in these two genes show a decreased ability to repair dsbs, and it is thought that this inability leads to the genomic instability that is characteristic of cancers containing ATM or DNA-PK mutations (Refs. 1Barlow C.

Whereas ATM and DNA-PK are required for the signaling initiated by dsbs, the cancer predisposition geneBRCA2 is required for the actual repair of dsbs. Cells that lack BRCA2 show decreased ability to survive ionizing radiation (6Sharan S.K. Morimatsu M. Albrecht U. Line D.-S. Regel E. Dinh C. Sands A. Eichele G. Hasty P. Bradley A.

Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All of these findings implicate dsb formation in the initiation of carcinogenesis. Much of the work implicating dsb formation in the initiation of carcinogenesis has focused on the signaling pathways induced by dsbs (e.g. ATM/DNA-PK) and on the repair of those dsbs (e.g. BRCA2). Less is known about the signaling induced by the agent causing the dsb. The most commonly used agent to induce dsbs is ionizing radiation. Whereas dsbs are the most prominent effect of ionizing radiation exposure, ionizing radiation also causes lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and protein oxidation (reviewed in Refs. 17Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar and 18Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 246: 501-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Thus, ionizing radiation activates the stress response pathway of the cell in a manner that is not necessarily dependent on the formation of dsbs (19Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Although it is not surprising that ionizing radiation activates the stress response pathway, it is unexpected that the typically growth-responsive MAP kinase cascade (reviewed in Refs. 28Crews C.M.

However, c-ras, c-RAF, ERK1, andERK2 have all been shown by independent groups to be activated by ionizing radiation (37Sklar M.D. Science. 1988; 239: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 38Kasid U.

It is unknown how activation of the MAP kinase pathway affects cellular survival in response to ionizing radiation, but the fact that activation has been seen so consistently suggests that activation of the MAP kinase cascade could be important for response of the cell to ionizing radiation. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway by the stress stimulus of ionizing radiation could be due to the fact that dsbs lead to different cell cycle checkpoint control than what is normally seen for DNA-damaging agents (reviewed in Refs. 42Bernhard E.J. Maity A. Muschel R.J. McKenna W.G. Radiat. Environ. Biophys. 1995; 34: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and 43Lohrer H.D. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Repair of dsbs follows two pathways, nonhomologous recombinational repair (occurring in G1) and homologous recombination repair (44Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 45Sargent R.G. Brenneman M.A. Wilson J.H. Mol. Cell.

Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Homologous recombinational repair occurs in G2, the time point when homologous, undamaged double-strand DNA is present to serve as a template for correct repair. Because the damaged DNA strand has a template for repair, homologous recombinational repair leads to fewer mutations than nonhomologous repair (44Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 47Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R.

Phys. 1997; 37: 639-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Therefore, the G2/M checkpoint is essential for the proper repair of DNA damaged by ionizing radiation. Recently, the MAP kinase pathway has been implicated in G2/M cell cycle regulation. InXenopus oocytes, MAP kinase activity has been shown to be necessary for progression through G2 (49Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 50Abrieu A. Doree M. Picard A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 51Abrieu A. Fisher D. Simon M.-N. Doree M. Picard A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6407-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The MEK1 and MEK2 activator, c-mos, has also been shown to be necessary for progression through G2 (52Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 486-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and in mouse oocytes, MAP kinase becomes activated at metaphase and localizes to the microtubule-organizing centers (53Verlhac M.-H. de Pennart H. Maro B. Cobb M.H. Clarke H.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Because the MAP kinase pathway is required for G2/M progression in a number of systems and because ionizing radiation leads both to activation of the MAP kinase pathway and to G2/M arrest, it is possible that ionizing radiation activates the MAP kinase cascade to exert an effect on G2/M checkpoint control. To address these questions, we focused on MEK1 and MEK2, two components of the MAP kinase cascade. These two proteins are phosphorylatedin vitro by RAF (54Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar, 55Allessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and can both phosphorylateERK1 and ERK2 (30Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3208) Google Scholar). MEK1 and MEK2 are approximately 80% homologous and are very similar in size (MEK1 = 45 kDa; MEK2 = 46 kDa). They differ in the first 30 amino acids of the N terminus and in a proline-rich region that is only found in MEK1 (56Wu J. Harrison J.K. Dent P. Lynch K.R. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4539-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 57Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we find that both MEK1 and MEK2 are specifically activated by ionizing radiation in a variety of cell lines. We show that cells that express dominant negative MEK2 show radiation hypersensitivity that is not seen in cells which equivalently express dominant negative forms of MEK1. Expression of dominant negative MEK2 leads to a slightly delayed G2/M arrest upon ionizing radiation exposure and a substantial inability to progress through the G2/M arrest upon recovery from that radiation exposure. Finally, we show that the effect of MEK2 on radiation sensitivity can be reversed by forcing G2progression through the use pharmacological agents. These data imply that ionizing radiation activates the MAP kinase cascade in a specific manner to maintain G2/M checkpoint fidelity. HeLa cells, NIH 3T3-L1 cells, and BxPC-3 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 2 mml-glutamine (Sigma), and 1× antimycotic/antibiotic (Sigma). HBL100 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in McCoy's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Serum starvation was performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1× antimycotic/antibiotic for 24 h followed by incubation in 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubating the cells in methionine-free media (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min, followed by the addition of methionine-free media supplemented with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine for 3 h. Stably transfected cell lines were generated by transfecting HeLa cells at 80% confluence with 20 μg of indicated construct (pREP4 (Invitrogen), pREP4-K97A MEK1, pREP4-S222A MEK1, pREP4-K101A MEK2, pREP4-wt MEK2, pREP4-S222E MEK1) using the calcium phosphate precipitation. Cells were split 1:3 the following day. Two days after transfection, selection was begun in 500 μg/ml hygromycin B (Life Technologies, Inc.). Three weeks later, approximately 1000 colonies were pooled and shown to express the desired protein by Western blotting. All cell lines were used within 2 weeks of establishment or within 3 weeks following liquid nitrogen thawing. The plasmids used in this work were the gifts of Edwin Krebs, University of Washington, Seattle (K97A MEK1, S222A MEK1); Natalie Ahn, University of Colorado, Boulder (pCML-MEK2); and Kun-Liang Guan, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (pGEX-MEK2). The K97A MEK and S222A MEK1 plasmids were supplied in the vector pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen). To subclone these genes into the pREP4 vector (Invitrogen), pCDNA-K97A MEK1, pCDNA-S222A MEK1, and pREP4 were digested with XhoI and HindIII (Life Technologies, Inc.). The K97A MEK1 fragment and the S222A MEK1 fragment was then ligated into pREP4. To generate the dominant negative K101A MEK2 construct, pCML-MEK2 was digested with BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and ligated into pGEM4Z (Promega). Pgem4Z-MEK2 was then digested with PstI (Life Technologies, Inc.) to generate a 400-bp fragment containing the region to be mutated. This 400-bp PstI fragment was then ligated into pGEM7Z (Promega). This pGEM7Z-400-bp MEK2 construct was then digested withBalI and NaeI (Life Technologies, Inc.), and an oligonucleotide containing the sequence 5′-CCAGGGCGCTGATCCACCTC GAGATCAAGCC-3′ was ligated into the digested MEK2. This oligonucleotide sequence contains a 2-base pair replacement (in bold) designed to mutate Lys-101 to alanine and a single base pair replacement (in italics) designed to insert an XhoI site without changing the amino acid sequence. The altered 400-bp fragment was then sequenced to ensure that the desired mutation was present and in frame. The pGEM7Z-400-bp K101A MEK2 construct was then digested with PstI, and the mutated 400-bp fragment was reinserted into pGEM4Z-MEK2. This plasmid was then sequenced to ensure that the mutation was present and in frame. In addition, in vitro translation of the protein gave a 46-kDa fragment that could be immunoprecipitated with an antibody to MEK2. The pGEM4Z-K101A MEK2 fragment was then digested with BamHI and inserted into the pREP4 vector. All pREP4 plasmids used for transfections were purified by ultracentrifugation using CsCl gradients prior to transfection. Immunoprecipitations and kinase assays were performed using a method described previously with slight modifications (58Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested by scraping. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm and rewashed with PBS followed by another 2000 rpm centrifugation. Cells were then lysed in Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.27 m sucrose, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), 0.5 μm okadaic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 mm NaF (Sigma), 5 mmsodium pyrophosphate (Sigma), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine (Sigma), 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma)) for 10 min at 4 °C. The suspension was then sonicated briefly and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was then extracted. Protein concentration was standardized using the Bio-Rad protein assay. 100 μg of total protein was then incubated with 10 μl of the given antibody (anti-N-terminal MEK1 or anti-N-terminal MEK2, and total volume was adjusted to 700 μl using Lysis Buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was then added for 1 h. The suspension was then centrifuged, and the precipitate was washed five times with Lysis Buffer (the 2nd and 3rd lysis buffer contained 0.5 m NaCl). For the metabolic labeling experiment, 2× SDS-PAGE buffer was added. The suspension was boiled and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography. For the kinase assays, the precipitate was then washed an additional three times in Kinase Buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.03% Brij 35 (Sigma), 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 μm okadaic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.27 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm magnesium chloride). After the washes, Kinase Buffer was added to the immunoprecipitate such that the total volume was 50 μl. 25 μl of this solution was added to a microcentrifuge tube containing 2.5 mg of GST-K71A ERK1 (Upstate Biotechology, Inc.) and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The kinase reaction was then initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 mm ATP supplemented with 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, 3000 μCi/ml) and allowed to incubate for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE Sample Buffer followed by boiling. 10 μl of the kinase reaction was then electrophoresed on a 7% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Counts/min phosphate transferred per μg of substrate were quantitated using the Packard Electronic Autoradiography Instant Imager and comparing activity of the sample with the activity of the unstimulated sample. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then harvested by scraping. Cells were centrifuged at 2000 rpm, rinsed again with PBS, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm. The pellet was then resuspended in Lysis Buffer and allowed to sit on ice for 10 min. The suspension was then sonicated. The suspension was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the pellet was discarded. Western blotting was then performed as described previously (59Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32454-32462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein concentration was standardized using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. Equal amounts of lysate were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel). Lysates were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 40 mV. To ensure equal loading of protein and equal transfer efficiency, the membrane was stained with Ponceau S prior to blocking. The membrane was blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.3% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. After blocking and subsequent washing, the blot was exposed to a 1:1000 dilution of the given antibody overnight at 4 °C. The blot was then washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, 0.3% Tween 20 before being exposed to a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:2500 at room temperature for 1 h. Bands were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies used were anti-phosphorylated MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs), anti-nonphosphorylated MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs), anti-N-terminal MEK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-N-terminal MEK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were irradiated using a 137Cs source at a dose rate of 2.35 Gy/min. Colony forming assays were performed as described previously (16Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14005-14008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 500 cells/dish and irradiated at a given dose. After irradiation, cells were returned to the 37 °C incubator. They were refed fresh media every 2 days. After 14 days, the colonies were fixed in ethanol and stained with crystal violet. Colonies were counted manually. Relative survival was determined by comparing colony number of cells irradiated at a given dose to the colony number of unirradiated cells plated at the same density and cultured for the same amount of time. For cellular survival following treatment with vanadate, approximately 2000 cells of each cell line (vector-only cells, K97A MEK1 cells, and K101A MEK2 cells) were plated 12 h prior to the commencement of the experiment. These cells were then treated with 50 μmvanadate (Sigma) for 8 h prior to irradiation. 16 h after irradiation with 5 Gy, cells were washed extensively and refed with normal media. All cells lines showed a strong G2 arrest by flow cytometry analysis. Three weeks later, cell survival was quantitated as described above (survival was compared with cells treated with vanadate in the same manner, but not irradiated). For cellular survival following treatment with caffeine, approximately 2000 cells of each cell line studied were plated as above. The cells were irradiated with 5 Gy and then treated with 2 mm caffeine (Calbiochem) 24 h after irradiation. 32 h after irradiation, flow cytometry showed recovery from G2 arrest in K101A MEK2 cells (relative to irradiated/no caffeine cells) and no difference between irradiated vector-only cells and K97A MEK1 cells either treated or untreated with caffeine (32 h after irradiation, vector-only cells and K97A MEK1 cells show normal cell cycle distribution; therefore, treatment with caffeine at 24 h has no effect on the cell cycle profile). Survival was measured as described above. Equal cell numbers were embedded into agarose plugs as described previously (8Abbott D.W. Freeman M.L. Holt J.T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 978-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The plugs were then exposed to the indicated doses of ionizing radiation at 4 °C. To allow the cells to repair damaged DNA, the cell plugs were then covered with 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media in a 37 °C incubator for the indicated period. The plugs were then"

Like many other nuclear receptors, PPARs are transcription factors that bind to specific DNA response elements (PPREs) upstream of target genes in heterodimeric complexes with the 9-cis-retinoid acid receptor RXR, leading to the activation of target gene transcription (11Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). PPARα and PPARγ play a key role in lipid homeostasis, adipocyte differentiation, and inflammatory responses (3Brun R.P. Kim J.B. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Curr. Opin.

(Lond.). 1995; 2: 261-266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). PPARα target genes include liver-expressed enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation and microsomal ω-hydroxylation (13Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol.

PPARα thus plays a direct role in liver homeostasis by regulating lipid storage and by modulating the metabolism of important lipid signaling molecules, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes. PPARα gene knock-out mice do not exhibit hepatic (16Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 67-74PubMed Google Scholar) peroxisome proliferative responses induced by fibrate drugs and other PPAR activators, demonstrating the key role played by PPARα in these processes. PPARα also mediates the carcinogenicity of foreign peroxisome proliferators (18Peters J.M. Cattley R.C. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2029-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), which are non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens when administered chronically to rodents (19Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 573-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PPARα gene expression and PPARα-stimulated transcriptional activity are tightly controlled by a variety of hormones that act at multiple levels and via different mechanisms. Glucocorticoids induce PPARα protein expression at the transcriptional level (20Lemberger T. Staels B. Saladin R. Desvergne B. Auwerx J. Wahli W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may account for the expression of PPARα diurnally and in a stress-inducible manner (21Lemberger T. Saladin R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 1764-1769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), whereas insulin treatment decreases PPARα mRNA levels (22Steineger H.H. Sorensen H.N. Tugwood J.D. Skrede S. Spydevold O. Gautvik K.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferative responses in rodents are suppressed by the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (23Chu R. Madison L.D. Lin Y. Kopp P. Rao M.S. Jameson J.L. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11593-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whose receptor may compete with PPAR for heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor RXR and for trans-activation of PPAR DNA response elements (PPREs) (24Miyamoto T.

Hepatic peroxisome proliferation can also be modulated by sex hormones, with female rats being less responsive than males to clofibrate and other peroxisome proliferators (25Kawashima Y. Uy Y.N. Kozuka H. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and testosterone treatment abolishing this sex difference (26Sugiyama H. Yamada J. Suga T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The observation that hypophysectomy enhances peroxisome proliferation in female rats (26Sugiyama H. Yamada J. Suga T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) suggests that a pituitary factor(s) serves as a negative regulator of peroxisome proliferation. In rats, the continuous plasma growth hormone (GH) profile characteristic of adult females fully suppresses liver expression of the clofibrate-inducible P450 4A2 fatty acid ω-hydroxylase (27Sundseth S.S. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3915-3921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same suppressive effect is observed in primary rat hepatocyte cultures, where GH inhibits peroxisomal β-oxidation induced by clofibrate (28Yamada J. Sugiyama H. Tamura H. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 29Sato T. Murayama N. Yamazoe Y. Kato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1256: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GH has diverse effects on metabolism and growth, some of which are indirectly mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 but many of which reflect the direct effects that GH has on gene expression. In particular, GH, like many cytokines and growth factors, directly activates JAK-STAT signaling pathways. GH binds to and thereby dimerizes its plasma membrane receptor (GHR) in a process that leads to JAK2 kinase-catalyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, which are latent, cytoplasmic transcription factors (30Carter Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to specific DNA response element and thereby activate target gene transcription (31Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar). Among the seven mammalian STATs, four forms (STATs 1, 3, 5a, and 5b) can be activated by GH (32Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Campbell G.S. Meyer D.J. Raz R. Levy D.E. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

In the present study, we investigate the mechanism that underlies the inhibitory effect of GH on peroxisome proliferation using COS-1 cells transfected to express both the GHR/JAK/STAT signaling pathway and the peroxisome proliferator-activated PPAR pathway. We find that GH inhibits PPARα-stimulated reporter gene transcription in a process that is mediated by STAT5b but not by STAT1. We further demonstrate that STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation are each essential for GH to mediate its inhibitory effects on PPARα activity. These findings are discussed in the context of the implications of this cross-talk between STAT5b and PPARα for the regulation of PPARα-dependent responses by hormones and cytokines.

COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of COS-1 cells grown in 12-well tissue culture plates was carried out by calcium phosphate precipitation (46Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At 9 h after addition of the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, cells were washed and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 12 h. Peroxisome proliferators were then added to the culture medium in combination with GH at concentrations specified in each figure. Cells were lysed 24 h later, and firefly luciferase and β-galactosidase (pCMV-βgal; internal control) reporter activities were measured using a Galacto-light chemiluminescent reporter kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). In some experiments, Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK; Promega, Madison, WI) was used in place of the pCMV-βgal internal control plasmid, as indicated in the figure legends. Firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfections were performed using the following amounts of plasmid DNA/well (3.8 cm2) of a 12-well tissue culture plate: 0.36 μg of reporter construct (pHD(X3)Luc or pLUCA6-880), 14 ng of pCMV-mPPARα, 0.2 μg of GHR expression plasmid, 0.12 μg of JAK2 expression plasmid, and 0.2 μg of STAT expression plasmid. pCMV-βgal (0.16 μg) or pRL-TK (30 ng) were included as internal controls in each cell transfection. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 0.96 μg/well using salmon sperm DNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Data shown in each figure are mean values ± S.D. (for n = 3 replicates) or mean values ± half the range (for duplicates) and are representative of at least three such independent experiments. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing transfected COS-1 cells in lysis buffer (Tropix, Inc.) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol added prior to use. 10 μg of cell extract was added to 2 μl of 5× gel-shift buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl), plus 1 μl of 2 μg/μl poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic) acid (Boehringer Mannhein), with water added to adjust the total volume to 15 μl. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature.32P-Labeled double-stranded DNA probe (1 μl; 10 fmol) was then added, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at room temperature and then 10 min on ice. Loading dye (2 μl of 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) was then added before the mixture was loaded onto an acrylamide gel (5.5% acrylamide, 0.7% bisacrylamide in 0.5× TBE). The gel was electrophoresed at 4 °C for 40 min at 100 V before loading. The gel was first electrophoresed for 20 min at 100 V at 4 °C at which point the dye entered the gel; electrophoresis was then continued at room temperature for 5 h. This procedure minimizes formation of nonspecific protein-DNA complexes (47Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For STAT5b supershift assays, 3 μl of anti-STAT5b antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; antibody sc-835) was added 10 min after the labeled DNA probe, followed by a 10-min incubation at room temperature and 10-min incubation on ice before samples were loaded on the gel. The STAT5 binding site of the rat β-casein promoter (5′-GGA-CTT-CTT-GGA-ATT-AAG-GGA-3′) was used as gel-shift probe for GH-activated STAT5a and STAT5b, and thesis-inducible element (SIE)-binding site (5′-gtc-gaC-ATT-TCC-CGT-AAA-TCg-tcga-3′) was used as gel-shift probe for analyzing GH-activated STAT1 and STAT3 (34Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled DNA probe corresponding to the Z element of theCYP4A6 gene (5′-g-CGC-AAA-CAC-TGA-ACT-AGG-GCA-AAG-TTG-AGG-GCA-G-3′) was used as probe for PPARα binding (48Palmer C.N. Hsu M.H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from COS-1 cells (15 μg; see above) were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with anti-STAT antibodies. STAT5b-specific antibody sc-835 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to mouse STAT5b amino acid 711–727 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse anti-STAT antibodies (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were as follows: anti-STAT5 (antibody S21520) was raised to sheep STAT5 amino acids 451–649; anti-STAT3 (antibody S21320) was raised to rat STAT3 amino acids 1–175; anti-STAT1 (antibody S21120) was raised to human STAT1 amino acids 592–731. To investigate the mechanism by which GH inhibits PPARα-dependent liver peroxisome proliferative responses, we reconstituted GH signaling and PPARα-dependent peroxisome proliferation pathways by cotransfection of key components into COS-1 cells. GH signal transduction was reconstituted by cotransfection of expression plasmids encoding GHR, JAK2 kinase, and STAT5b, the major GH-responsive STAT form in liver (34Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5929-5940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The PPARα pathway was reconstituted by cotransfection of a mouse PPARα expression plasmid, together with reporter plasmid containing 880 nucleotides of 5′-flanking DNA of the rabbit CYP4A6 gene (13Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Transfected cells were stimulated with the peroxisome proliferator Wy-14,643 at 20 μm for 24 h in the presence or absence of GH (200 ng/ml). Fig. 1 A shows that Wy-14,643 activation of the CYP4A6 promoter is significantly decreased in the presence of GH. Wy-14,643 activation of theCYP4A6 promoter is mediated by PPARα, which binds to one strong and two weaker PPREs within the 5′-flanking 880 nucleotides (13Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49Palmer C.N. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16114-16121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This GH inhibitory effect may be due to GH suppression of PPARα-dependent transcription via the CYP4A6PPREs; alternatively, GH may interfere with other transcription factors required for either basal or Wy-14,643-inducible CYP4A6promoter transcription, independent of PPRE. To distinguish these possibilities, we examined the effect of GH on PPARα-activation of the reporter construct pHD(X3)Luc, which contains three tandem repeats of a PPRE from the gene that encodes enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, cloned upstream of a minimal promoter and luciferase reporter gene (15Zhang B. Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Subramani S. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12939-12945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that GH inhibits, by up to 80–85%, PPARα induction mediated by this isolated PPRE. Maximal GH inhibition was achieved at 25 ng/ml, well within the physiological range of GH concentrations and consistent with the reported K d of GHR for GH of ∼2 ng/ml (50Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effects of GH on PPARα activation were also apparent with several other PPARα activators, including both foreign chemicals (nafenopin, a fibrate hypolipidemic drug) and the endogenous PPARα activators (8S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene B4 (Fig. 1 C). Since some, but not all GH intracellular events involve JAK/STAT signaling pathways (30Carter Su C. Schwartz J. Smit L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 187-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we examined whether GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b are each required for the inhibitory effect of GH on PPARα activity. Fig. 2 A shows that inhibition of PPARα activity by 25 ng/ml GH (lanes 3 versus lane 2) was not observed in the absence of cotransfected GHR (lane 4) or STAT5b (lane 5). A similar dependence on GHR and STAT5b was observed at higher GH concentrations (100–500 ng/ml GH; data not shown). In the absence of transfected JAK2, GH could still activate STAT5b and inhibit PPARα activity using the low levels of JAK2 expressed endogenously in COS-1 cells, although a higher GH concentration (500 ng/ml) was required for maximal PPARα inhibition (data not shown). Interestingly, cotransfection of GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b significantly reduced the moderate PPARα-dependent but Wy-14,643-independent basal luciferase reporter activity, even in the absence of GH (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 versus 1). This Wy-14,643-independent activity has been associated with the presence of endogenous PPAR activators, such as fatty acids (4Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1865) Google Scholar, 5Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this basal PPAR activity likely results from the constitutive activation of STAT5b upon overexpression of JAK2, as shown in the gel-shift studies described below (Fig. 2 B). GH stimulation further decreased the Wy-14,643-independent PPARα activity up to 4-fold (data not shown). To confirm the reconstitution of STAT5b activity in the GH-stimulated COS-1 cells, EMSA assays were carried out using a β-casein promoter probe, which contains a single STAT5b-binding site. No STAT5b DNA binding was detected upon GH stimulation of untransfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2). This indicates that COS-1 cells have at most low levels of GHR and/or STAT5b and are thus suitable for use as recipient cells in these transfection studies. In cells cotransfected with GHR, JAK2, and STAT5b, a low basal STAT5b DNA binding was observed in the absence of GH; this STAT5b activity was not affected by Wy-14,643 treatment (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 versus 5). Thus, overexpression of JAK2 and STAT5b results in some constitutive activation of STAT5b DNA binding activity. Stimulation with GH yielded a much higher level of STAT5b DNA binding activity (lane 7 versus 5). The β-casein DNA-binding complexes obtained in these experiments were confirmed to contain STAT5b, as shown by supershift analysis using anti-STAT5b antibody (lanes 4, 6, and8). In addition to STAT5b, GH can activate three other STAT proteins, STATs 1, 3, and 5a (32Gronowski A.M. Rotwein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7874-7878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Campbell G.S. Meyer D.J. Raz R. Levy D.E. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol.

Fig.3 shows, however, that in COS-1 cells transfected with STAT1, GH did not decrease PPARα-induced luciferase reporter activity, even at a high GH concentration (500 ng/ml). Partial GH inhibition of PPARα activity was seen in COS-1 cells transfected with STAT3 or with the closely related (41Mui A.L. Wakao H. Harada N. O'Farrell A.M. Miyajima A.

In control experiments, all four STATs were shown by Western blotting to be highly expressed in the transfected COS-1 cells compared with untransfected controls (Fig. 3 B; lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). The lower effectiveness of STAT5a compared with STAT5b is not because of its inefficient activation by GH, as shown by EMSA using32P-labeled β-casein probe (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3and 4 versus lanes 6 and 7).

Both isoforms are rapidly phosphorylated in response to thromboxane agonists when overexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells; this phenomenon is only slightly altered by inhibitors of protein kinase C. Pharmacological studies have defined two classes of TP in human platelets; sites that bind the agonist I-BOP with high affinity support platelet shape change. Low affinity sites, which irreversibly bind the antagonist GR 32191, transduce platelet activation and aggregation. Isoform-specific antibodies permitted detection of TPα, but not TPβ, from human platelets, although mRNA for both isoforms is present. A broad protein band of 50–60 kDa, reflecting the glycosylated receptor, was phosphorylated upon activation of platelets for 2 min with I-BOP. This was a rapid (∼30 s) and transient (maximum, 2–4 min) event and was inhibited by TP antagonists. Both arachidonic acid and low concentrations of collagen stimulated TPα phosphorylation, which was blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibition or TP antagonism. Blockade of the low affinity TP sites with GR 32191 prevented I-BOP-induced TPα phosphorylation. This coincided with agonist-induced platelet aggregation and activation but not shape change. Also, activation of these sites with the isoprostane iPF2α-III induced platelet shape change but not TPα phosphorylation. Heterologous TP phosphorylation was observed in aspirin-treated platelets exposed to thrombin, high concentrations of collagen, and the calcium ionophore A 23187. Both homologous and heterologous agonist-induced phosphorylation of endogenous TPα was blocked by protein kinase C inhibitors. TPα was the only isoform detectably translated in human platelets. This appeared to correspond to the activation of the low affinity site defined by the antagonist GR 32191 and not activated by the high affinity agonist, iPF2α-III.

Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F181-F191PubMed Google Scholar) following activation by agonists, such as arachidonic acid, thrombin, collagen, or ADP. Although a weak agonist itself, TxA2plays an important role in amplifying the response to other, more potent platelet agonists (2FitzGerald G.A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1991; 68: 11B-15BAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Studies with pharmacological ligands in human platelets have suggested the presence of two distinct populations of receptors (3Dorn II., G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 1883-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distinct functions have been attributed to these subtypes: (i) aggregation and granule secretion appear to be mediated by receptors with low affinity for the agonist ligand I-BOP, which are bound irreversibly by the antagonist GR 32191; and (ii) shape change appears to be mediated by receptors with high affinity for I-BOP, which are bound reversibly by GR 32191 (3Dorn II., G.W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the molecular basis for this functional segregation of pharmacological TP subtypes is unknown. TP purified from human platelets consists of a broad protein band of 57 kDa (5Ushikubi F. Nakajima M. Hirata M. Okuma M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol.

Initial cloning of the TP, from megakaryoblastic cell lines and human placental cDNA libraries (referred to as the placental TP or the TPα isoform) implied its membership in the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily (GPCR) (7Hirata M.

Because no pharmacological ligand can presently distinguish between these two isoforms, it is still unknown how they relate to the pharmacological subtypes of the TP in human platelets.

O'Mahony D.J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar) and reversible aggregation at high concentrations. Although these effects are inhibited by TP antagonists (18Yin K. Halushka P.V. Yan Y.-T. Wong P.Y.-K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar), it is unknown whether the isoprostane acts solely via TPs. Evidence consistent with the possibility of receptors specific to iPF2α-III was described in platelets and vascular smooth muscle cells (14Praticò D. Smyth E.M. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation is an important mechanism in rapid desensitization of many GPCRs, as exemplified by the β2-adrenergic receptors (20Gomez J. Benovic J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bouvier M. Loisel T.P. Hebert T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Different kinases can phosphorylate these receptors: for example, G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) are receptor-specific kinases that phosphorylate the agonist-occupied receptor, whereas PKC or PKA can be activated by other ligands and participate in heterologous receptor desensitization (20Gomez J. Benovic J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 1-34PubMed Google Scholar, 22Benovic J.L. Bouvier M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Although it is appreciated that the role of distinct kinases in the phosphorylation of a particular GPCR may vary according to cell type, study of this process has largely been confined to heterologous expression systems (23Oppermann M.

There are actually few reported studies of agonist-induced phosphorylation of endogenous receptors (26Tardif M. Mery L. Brouchon L. Boulay F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3534-3545PubMed Google Scholar), probably because they are usually expressed in relatively low abundance. We have previously described isoform-specific antibodies for TPs (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A.

Upon activation of the platelets with a TP agonist or arachidonic acid as a source of endogenous TxA2 a rapid, transient, and PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the TPα occurs. This involves the low affinity form of the TP, as defined by irreversible binding of GR 32191. Furthermore, TPα may also be phosphorylated in a PKC-dependent manner in response to platelet activation by thrombin in aspirin-treated platelets. The major role of PKC in rapid, agonist-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous TPα in platelets contrasts with our previous observations when recombinant TPα was overexpressed in HEK-293 cells (27Habib A.

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was from Aldrich. Nonidet P-40 was from BDH (Poole, United Kingdom). Bisindolylmaleimide I or GF109203X, Ro-31–8220, and okadaic acid were from Calbiochem (San Diego, Ca). Collagen was from Diagnostica Stago (Asnières, France) and was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prostaglandin (PG) E1, PGE2, iPF2α-III, I-BOP, U 46619, and SQ 29548 were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). PNGase F (500 units/μl) was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, Ma).

P-Tyr monoclonal antibody (4 G 10) was from UBI (Lake Placid, Ny). All electrophoresis reagents were from J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ). Peripheral blood from healthy volunteers, who had not received any medication for at least 10 days, was collected into ACD-A anticoagulant (National Institute of Health formula: 0.8% citric acid, 2.2% trisodium citrate, 2H2O, 2.45% glucose) and 1 mm of aspirin unless otherwise indicated. Informed consent was obtained from all donors in conformity with the French Etablissement de Transfusion Sanguine committee. The blood was centrifuged at 120 ×g for 20 min at 20 °C, and platelet-rich plasma was collected, acidified with ACD-A, and further centrifuged at 1200 × g for 20 min. The platelets were washed in a phosphate-free modified tyrode buffer without calcium (Buffer A, pH 6.8: 136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 12 mmNaHCO3, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose) in the presence of 0.1 μmPGE1. Platelets were resuspended at 109/ml in the same buffer and labeled with 1 mCi/ml of [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h 30 min at room temperature (28Vezza R. Roberti R. Nenci G.G. Gresele P. Blood. 1993; 82: 2704-2713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After further washing in the same buffer, platelets were resuspended in the reaction buffer (Buffer A containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 4 × 108/ml and allowed to rest at room temperature for 1 h before aggregation was performed. Unless otherwise indicated, the platelet suspension was incubated at 4 × 108/ml (0.4 ml per sample) in an aggregometer cuvette for 1 min at 37 °C. Different agonists or vehicle were then added, with constant stirring for 2 min. Platelets were incubated without stirring in the presence or absence of the TP agonist for varied periods of time (0.5–60 min) in the kinetic experiments. SQ 29548, RGES, RGDS, Ro-43–5054, and Ro-44–9883 were preincubated for 1 min prior to platelet activation. PKC inhibitors were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Me2SO and ethanol concentrations did not exceed 0.05% and did not modify platelet function or the pattern of phosphorylation of TPα. The reaction was stopped using 1 volume of 2× radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× radioimmune precipitation buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet-P40 (v/v), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v), containing 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm ATP, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Samples were further treated to immunoprecipitate the TPs as described below. The phosphorylation of pleckstrin p-47, a PKC substrate, was assessed by SDS-PAGE of 20 μl of total platelet lysate (29Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shorr R.G. Haslam R.J.

Haematol. 1990; 74: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). TxB2, the inactive hydrolysis product of TxA2, was measured in the platelet lysates by enzyme immunoassay (31Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of TPs was performed using specific polyclonal antibodies for human TP isoforms (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, these antibodies were directed against peptides located at the end of the carboxyl-terminal tail of either TPα or TPβ: NH2-SLSLQPQLTQRSGLQ-COOH (referred to as Abα) for TPα and NH2-(C)-PFEPPTGKALSRKD-COOH (referred to as Abβ) for TPβ. Immunoaffinity columns with each antibody were prepared as follows. Briefly, antisera were first partially purified using the E-Z-SEP® kit and further incubated with CNBr-activated Sepharose, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoglobulins derived from nonimmune rabbit serum, coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose, were used to preclear the platelet lysates. After preclearing for 1 h at 4 °C, using 50 μl of normal rabbit IgG covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B, samples were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using 50 μl of immunoaffinity Sepharose for either antibody. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer (4% SDS (w/v), 5% glycerol (v/v), 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 m urea, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) under nonreducing conditions. Samples were vigorously vortexed for 15 min, centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 ×g, and loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analysis of radioactivity in the samples was performed using a Fuji BioImaging Analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan) after the gels were dried. In some cases, immunoblot analysis of the TP isoforms was performed. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The TPs were visualized using the Abα or Abβ followed by a donkey anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Positive protein bands were revealed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. [32P]Pi-labeled platelets were incubated with 10 nm I-BOP for 2 min. Labeled HEK-TPα or HEK-TPβ was incubated for 10 min with 300 nmU 46619 as defined previously (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). TPα or TPβ were immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoprecipitates were further denatured for 10 min at 90 °C with SDS 0.5% and β-mercaptoethanol 1% prior to the addition of 1250 units of PNGase F per reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was carried on for 1 h at 37 °C and then stopped with 1× Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to Biomax MS films. Platelets were exposed to high or low concentrations of I-BOP, thrombin, or pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, which induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation. After a 4-min incubation, platelets were lysed as described above, and tyrosine phosphorylation was assayed in total platelet lysates or after immunoprecipitation of the TPα receptor isoform by immunoblot analysis, using a specific P-Tyr monoclonal antibody. We used polyclonal antibodies raised against specific sequences of TPα or TPβ, to isolate TPs from human platelets. Polyclonal antibodies specific for TPα (Abα) were used to immunoprecipitate 1 mg of human platelet lysate, which corresponds to 0.3 pmol/mg of protein, as assessed by binding of [3H]SQ 29548. A broad band with a molecular weight of 50–60 was detected after immunoblot analysis with the same antibody (Fig. 1 A). Abα also immunoprecipitated the TPα from HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the corresponding cDNA (Fig. 1 A) as described previously (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, immunoprecipitation of 1 mg of total platelet protein lysate using the TPβ isoform-specific antipeptide antiserum failed to reveal any detectable band (Fig.1 A), although these antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate the TPβ receptor isoform from HEK-293 overexpressing these receptors (Fig. 1 A). These antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate as little as 50 fmol of receptors/mg of protein from HEK-293 overexpressing either TPα or TPβ. Using these cells, we have previously shown that these antibodies were both isoform-specific by Western blotting and by immunofluorescence analysis (data not shown). We next checked that the broad protein band isolated from platelets with Abα was glycosylated. Results were compared with the digestion of TPs in HEK-293-TPα or TPβ. To avoid technical problems subsequent to deglycosylation of the antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, we performed these experiments on phosphorylated TPs, which are obtained after activation with TP agonist, as demonstrated below. Deglycosylation with PNGase F resulted in a shift of the broad protein band from 50–60 kDa in platelets and from 55–70 kDa HEK-293 cells, to an apparent molecular weight of 28. Deglycosylation of TPβ also revealed a shift in the molecular weight to 32.5. These results indicate that the broad protein band of 50–60 kDa observed in platelets corresponds to glycosylated TPα and that TPα in HEK-293 cells and human platelets are differentially glycosylated. The difference in the apparent molecular weight between deglycosylated TPα and TPβ corresponds to the difference in the number of amino acids between the two isoforms (343 amino acids for TPα and 407 for TPβ). Homologous and heterologous desensitization of human platelets in response to U46619, a TxA2 mimetic, or to thrombin has been reported previously (32Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 89: 124-128Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33Okwu A.K. Ullian M.E. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 238-245PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of aspirin-treated platelets with I-BOP, a Tx analog, for increasing periods of time, resulted in the phosphorylation of a broad protein band of 50–60 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Phosphorylation was rapid (≤0.5 min) but transient (maximum, 2–4 min). We regularly observed a phosphorylated band of 68 kDa in these samples, with a stronger signal in activated platelets. Detection of this band was not modified when immunoprecipitation of TPα was performed in the presence of the specific Abα-peptide used for immunization, whereas immunoprecipitation of the broad protein band of 50–60 kDa was completely abolished (data not shown), suggesting that it is not related to TP receptors. Low concentrations of I-BOP (≤0.3 nm) that induced only shape change in the absence of platelet aggregation (32Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 89: 124-128Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 34Dorn II, G.W. DeJesus A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H327-H334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) failed to phosphorylate pleckstrin or induce aggregation (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, no phosphorylation of TPα was observed (Fig.2 B). Only higher concentrations of I-BOP (>1–30 nm) induced reproducible phosphorylation of TPα (Fig.2 B). SQ 29548, a TP antagonist, suppressed phosphorylation of TPα. (Fig. 2 C). Since previous pharmacological studies suggested the presence of high and low affinity receptors in human platelets, we investigated the relevance of these observations in the phosphorylation of TPs in human platelets. We used a particular TP antagonist, GR 32191, that dissociates very slowly, if at all, from the low affinity binding sites in human platelets (4Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 D illustrates this effect. When platelets derived from PRP treated with 1 μm of GR32191, no increase in TPα phosphorylation was observed with I-BOP 10 nm. TPα in platelets derived from untreated-PRP were normally phosphorylated by I-BOP and GR 32191 inhibited this phosphorylation, similarly to SQ 29548. Further characterization of this phosphorylation showed that okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases, resulted in an increase in TPα phosphorylation. Under these conditions, receptor phosphorylation was sustained for up to 30 min, compared to 4 min in the absence of okadaic acid (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated TPα using P-Tyr antibodies did not reveal any phosphorylation of TPα in platelets activated with I-BOP, thrombin, or pervanadate, a strong inhibitor of tyrosine-phosphatases (35Pumiglia K.M. Lau L.F. Huang C.K. Burroughs S. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), despite marked tyrosine kinase-dependent substrate phosphorylation (data not shown). Previous studies by our group and others have shown that iPF2α-III induces platelet shape change (14Praticò D. Smyth E.M. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14916-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,16Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Roberts L.J.d. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), Ca2+ mobilization, and reversible platelet aggregation at high concentrations of the agonist (15Kinsella B.T. O'Mahony D.J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar, 18Yin K. Halushka P.V. Yan Y.-T. Wong P.Y.-K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 1192-1196PubMed Google Scholar). All of these effects were abolished by TP antagonists. However, iPF2α-III-induced inositol phosphate formation in human platelets was not blocked by TP antagonists (14Praticò D. Smyth E.M. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14916-14924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we failed to observe TPα phosphorylation with 5–50 μm iPF2α-III (Fig.3 A). Although iPF2α-III induced platelet shape change, neither prolongation of the incubation time (5 min) (Fig. 3 A) nor pretreatment with 1 μm okadaic acid induced significant TPα phosphorylation as compared with control unstimulated platelets (data not shown). Thus, iPF2α-III appears to favor activation of the high affinity sites, which mediates platelet shape change. In contrast, pretreatment of platelets with 50 μmof iPF2α-III reduced I-BOP-induced platelet aggregation (60%) and TPα phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B), consistent with a competition between I-BOP and high concentrations of iPF2α-III for the occupancy of the low affinity sites, which mediate agonist-induced phosphorylation of TPα in human platelets. Moreover, activation of HEK-TPα cells with iPF2α-III resulted in TPα phosphorylation (data not shown). We next tested whether endogenously formed TxA2 induces phosphorylation of the platelet TPα. Addition of arachidonic acid (2.5 μm) to platelets resulted in the formation of 200–400 ng/ml of TxB2 (corresponding to 0.2 × 109 platelets). Under these conditions, TPα was phosphorylated, to a degree similar to platelets, when incubated with 10 nm I-BOP (Fig. 4). When platelets were pretreated with 10 μm of SQ 29548 or flurbiprofen, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, TPα phosphorylation was inhibited, demonstrating that endogenous TxA2 (or PGH2) formed by cyclooxygenase-1 was responsible for receptor phosphorylation in response to arachidonic acid (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with a low concentration of collagen (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that TPα phosphorylation can occur in activated platelets via endogenous TxA2generation. In these samples, platelet aggregation and pleckstrin phosphorylation were also inhibited by SQ 29548 and flurbiprofen treatment. Because heterologous activation of platelets by non-thromboxane agonists may contribute to the desensitization of TPα (32Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 89: 124-128Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we examined the ability of various agonists to phosphorylate TPα. We utilized aspirin-treated platelets, thus excluding signaling via endogenous TxA2 formation. Thrombin, calcium ionophore A23187 and the active phorbol ester PMA, phosphorylated the TPα (Fig.5 A). In these experiments, the absence of endogenous TxA2 was verified by measuring TxB2 in platelet lysates by enzyme immunoassay (data not shown). Phosphorylation of pleckstrin was also observed (Fig.5 A). In contrast, little phosphorylation of either substrate was obtained with 200 nm PGE1 or PGE2 or with 10 μm forskolin (Fig.5 A). Although platelet aggregation induced by low concentrations of collagen is dependent on the formation of TxA2 (Fig. 4), higher concentrations can bypass this inhibition. When collagen was used at 100 μg/ml, neither flurbiprofen nor SQ 29548 prevented platelet aggregation and phosphorylation of the TPα and pleckstrin (Fig. 5 A). Thrombin-induced phosphorylation of TPα was transient (Fig. 5 B) and resembled kinetics observed with I-BOP-induced phosphorylation (described in Fig. 2 A). Because we observed that TxA2 and all other agonists tested induced phosphorylation of TPα and pleckstrin, we utilized specific PKC inhibitors to address the role of this kinase in TPα phosphorylation. Pretreatment of platelets for 30 min at 37 °C with two structurally distinct but specific PKC inhibitors, GF 109203X and Ro-31–8220, prior to platelet activation with I-BOP, resulted in a dramatic reduction in TPα phosphorylation (∼80%) (Fig. 6). Thrombin-induced TPα phosphorylation was also inhibited by GF 109203X (Fig. 6, right panel). The effectiveness of these molecules as inhibitors of PKC was assessed by their capacity to inhibit the PMA-dependent phosphorylation TPα (Fig. 6, right panel). Our recent studies on the phosphorylation of recombinant TP isoforms stably expressed in HEK-293 cells showed little involvement of PKC in response to TxA2 mimetics, although PMA could readily induce PKC-dependent TP phosphorylation in this system (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, agonist-induced phosphorylation of TPα in human platelets, in contrast to the HEK-293 expression system, appears largely dependent on PKC. Activation of platelets by U 46619, a stable Tx analog, has been shown to result in the association of pp60src with the cytoskeleton (36Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such events, related to ligand occupancy of GpIIb/IIIa, may play a role in the phosphorylation of TPα via “inside-out” signaling (37Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100 Suppl. 11: S91-S95Google Scholar). Thus, the influence of platelet aggregation on TPα phosphorylation was investigated. The active peptide, RGDS, and two peptide mimetics that are antagonists of GpIIb/IIIa, Ro-43-5054 and Ro-44-9883, were used. The phosphorylation of TPα by I-BOP was unaffected in the presence of 50 μmRGDS, 0.1 μm Ro-43–5054, or 0.2 μmRo-44–9883 (Fig. 7 A). Under these conditions, I-BOP-induced platelet aggregation was totally inhibited (Fig. 7 B). Also, phosphorylation of TPα induced by I-BOP was unchanged under either stirring or nonstirring conditions (data not shown). In a few blood donors, we observed a small increase (∼20%) in TPα phosphorylation in nonaggregating conditions (data not shown). Moreover, TPα phosphorylation induced by low or high concentrations of collagen was not modified by RGDS (Fig.7 C), thus dissociating platelet TP receptor phosphorylation from aggregation. These results suggest that engagement of the GpIIb/IIIa complex is downstream of the events leading to agonist-induced phosphorylation of TPα. Although mRNA detection for the two recognized human TP isoforms has been reported in human platelets (13Hirata T. Ushikubi F. Kakizuka A. Okuma M. Narumiya S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether either or both are translated to protein. It is also unknown whether these isoforms relate to the high and low affinity forms of the receptors that have been characterized pharmacologically (4Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using isoform-specific antibodies, we were able to immunoprecipitate TPα as a 50–60-kDa protein band from platelet lysate. TPβ could not be detected. We estimate that ≥ 50 fmol/mg of protein of TPβ could be detected with the specific antibodies from binding experiments in HEK-293 cells transfected with the TPβ isoform. These results suggest that TPβ is expressed at very low levels, if at all, in human platelets. In the present studies, Tx analogs induced rapid agonist-induced phosphorylation of a broad protein band in platelets. Many arguments support that this broad phosphorylated protein band appears to correspond to the TPα isoform. Thus, (i) the broad protein band is specifically immunoprecipitated with the Abα antibodies and migrates at the same molecular weight as that revealed by immunoblot analysis, (ii) digestion of immunoprecipitated TPα with PNGase F results in an apparent molecular weight similar to that obtained from HEK-293 cells transfected with recombinant TPα, and (iii) the phosphorylation of the 50–60-kDa protein band is associated with TP receptor activation. SQ 29548, a TP receptor antagonist, suppress agonist-induced phosphorylation of this band. Previous results by different groups (5Ushikubi F. Nakajima M. Hirata M. Okuma M. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16496-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,38Okwu A.K. Mais D.E. Halushka P.V. Biochim. Biophys.

Other authors have reported a sharp protein band of 55 kDa obtained from oligodendrocytes, neuronal cells (40Blackman S.C. Dawson G. Antonakis K. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), rat aorta (39Borg C. Lim C.T. Yeomans D.C. Dieter J.P. Komiotis D. Anderson E.G. Le Breton G.C. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may reflect differential sensitivity of the detection systems involved (ligand affinity or immunoaffinity purification systems). There is presently no information that relates either TPα or TPβ to the subtypes of TPs that have been defined pharmacologically (4Takahara K. Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6836-6844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, rapid agonist-induced phosphorylation of TPα appeared to involve signaling through low affinity binding sites. Thus, neither low concentrations of the agonist I-BOP, which induce platelet shape change, nor high agonist concentrations on platelets pretreated with GR 32191 (which blocks the low affinity sites) caused TPα phosphorylation. TxA2 originating in platelets from exogenous (i.e. addition of arachidonic acid) or from endogenous arachidonic acid (i.e. low concentrations of collagen) caused phosphorylation of TPα. Thus, endogenous TxA2 (or PGH2) can bind to and activate the receptor, resulting in its phosphorylation in a manner similar to that observed using the synthetic ligand I-BOP. Other platelet agonists, such as thrombin, high concentrations of collagen, PMA, and A23187, also induce TPα phosphorylation in aspirin-treated platelets. It is possible that this phosphorylation relates to homologous or heterologous desensitization of the TP by other platelet agonists (32Murray R. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1989; 89: 124-128Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 41Murray R. Shipp E. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21670-21675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Examples of heterologous phosphorylation of GPCRs include endothelin-dependent phosphorylation of α1B-adrenoreceptors (42Vazquez-Prado J. del Carmen Medina L. Garcia-Sainz J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27330-27337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and thrombin-dependent phosphorylation of the prostacyclin receptor (43Smyth E.M. Nestor P.V. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33698-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).Our results suggest that I-BOP, thrombin, and PMA-induced TPα phosphorylation were dependent on PKC because specific PKC inhibitors suppressed TPα phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of TPα occurs in response to PMA in both platelets and transfected HEK-293 cells (27Habib A. Vezza R. Créminon C. Maclouf J. FitzGerald G.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This indicates that PKC phosphorylation sites are present in TPα. However, the role of this kinase in mediating agonist-induced TPα phosphorylation differs between native receptors in human platelets and recombinant TPα stably expressed in HEK-293 (27Habib A.

Differences in affinities, or in the relative abundance of the receptors, or in the amounts of the kinases in different cells could explain this diversity of response. Another difference involves the absence of response of this receptor to the isoprostanes in human platelets. iPF2α-III increased phosphorylation of TPα in the expression system. However, in human platelets, iPF2α-III failed to cause a dose-dependent increase in TPα phosphorylation, despite stimulating inositol phosphate formation as described earlier (44Kunapuli P. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27147-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the TPα isoform exists in human platelets; TPβ is much less abundant, if it is expressed at all. Phosphorylation of TPα is consistent with the activation of the low affinity site defined pharmacologically with GR 32191. Our results suggest that human platelet TPα is phosphorylated by TxA2analogs and by other platelet agonists, such as thrombin, through activation of PKCs. Differences in the regulation of the Tx-dependent TP phosphorylation in the HEK-293 overexpressing system, where PKC is of marginal importance, could derive from differences in cellular contents of kinases and their affinity for the receptors in the presence of their ligands. Thus, heterologous expression systems afford sufficient levels of protein to simplify the study of posttranslational modifications of GPCRs. However, such observations may not accurately mimic the regulation of all endogenous receptors in their native milieu. We thank Dr. Sylviane Lévy-Toledano for helpful advice and continuous support."
https://openalex.org/W2054488370,"Although the enzyme or enzymes mediating shedding of L-selectin have not yet been identified, this activity can be blocked by synthetic hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors of metalloproteinases such as Ro 31-9790. However, the endogenous matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 does not block L-selectin shedding. Here, we report that TIMP-3, but not TIMP-2, inhibits L-selectin shedding from mouse and human lymphocytes, Jurkat T cells, and human monocytes. TIMP-3 has an IC50 of 0.3–0.4 μm on these cell types compared with 0.7–4.8 μm for Ro 31-9790. A metalloproteinase (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-converting enzyme; ADAM17) has recently been identified which cleaves the pro-form of TNF-α to produce soluble cytokine. We compared inhibition of L-selectin shedding by TIMPs and Ro 31-9790 with inhibition of TNF-α shedding from human monocytes. TIMP-3 inhibited TNF-α shedding (IC50 of 0.1 μm), as did Ro 31-9790 (IC50 of 0.4 μm). TIMP-2 had a partial effect, and TIMP-1 did not inhibit.

This study confirms that L-selectin sheddase is a metalloproteinase, but not a matrix metalloproteinase, and investigates the relationship between shedding of L-selectin and TNF-α. L-selectin is one of three members of the selectin family and is expressed on leukocytes (for review, see Ref. 1Tedder T.F. Steeber D.A. Chen A. Engel P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Through binding to mucin-like carbohydrate ligands on vascular endothelium,L-selectin mediates the tethering and rolling of leukocytes, which precedes their migration into lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation. L-selectin is rapidly down-regulated from the leukocyte surface within minutes by a number of stimuli including chemoattractants (2Kishimoto T.K. Jutila M.A. Berg E.L. Butcher E.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1238-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), phorbol ester (3Jung T.M. Dailey M.O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3130-3136PubMed Google Scholar, 4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J.

Holzmann B. Thiele H.-G. Hamann A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1992; 35: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). L-selectin is also down-regulated on leukocytes that have migrated across cultured endothelial cells (7Smith C.W. Kishimoto T.K. Abbass O. Hughes B. Rothlein R. McIntire L.V. Butcher E. Anderson D.C.

The latter observation led to the suggestion that L-selectin down-regulation from the leukocyte surface may be required for transendothelial migration, although it is not necessary for migration of neutrophils across human umbilical vein endothelial cells (10Allport J.R. Ding H.T. Ager A. Steeber D.A. Tedder T.F. Luscinskas F.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4365-4372PubMed Google Scholar). Rapid down-regulation of L-selectin has recently been shown to be the result of proteolytic cleavage in the membrane proximal extracellular domain (11Kahn J. Ingraham R.H. Shirley F. Migaki G.I. Kishimoto T.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The cleavage site has been mapped in human L-selectin to Lys283–Ser284. The activity mediating this proteolytic cleavage (L-selectin sheddase) is inhibited by the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases Ro 31-9790 (4Preece G. Murphy G.

To characterize L-selectin sheddase further, we have tested the ability of two additional members of the TIMP family, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 (for review, see Ref. 14Gomez D.E. Alonso D.F. Yoshiji H. Thorgeirsson U.P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 111-122PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit L-selectin shedding from leukocytes. These inhibitors are structurally homologous to TIMP-1, which we have already shown does not inhibit shedding of L-selectin (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, the expression patterns and inhibitory specificities of the TIMPs differ (15Langton K.P.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that although all three proteins inhibit the MMPs, they have some functional differences that may be useful in the characterization of L-selectin sheddase. Proteolytic cleavage is a commonly used mechanism for down-regulation of cell surface proteins (17Borland G. Tanousis K.M. Ager A. Bradshaw D. Nixon J.S. Bottomley K. Metalloproteinases as Targets for Anti-inflammatory Drugs. Birkhauser, Basel1999Google Scholar). Like L-selectin, the shedding of a number of these proteins is inhibited by the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors at concentrations much greater than those required to inhibit the MMPs (18Arribas J.

This enzyme belongs to the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. To determine the relationship between these enzymes and L-selectin sheddase, we compared the sensitivities of TNF-α shedding and L-selectin shedding from human peripheral blood monocytes to inhibition by TIMPs and synthetic hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors.

Tissues were collected into calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-CMF) at 4 °C and cell suspensions prepared. Human lymphocytes and monocytes were prepared from buffy coat preparations of peripheral blood obtained from the North London Blood Transfusion Service (Colindale, London). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by flotation over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). E6.1 Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For experiments, mouse lymphocytes and Jurkat cells were resuspended at 5 × 107/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% FCS and 10 mm Hepes. Human PBMC were resuspended at 2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Mouse lymphocytes or Jurkat T cells (2.5 × 106 in 50 μl) were incubated with 100 nm PMA or an equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide for 60 min. Cells were pretreated with inhibitor for 20 min and throughout the assay. Inhibitors and PMA were removed by washing in PBS-CMF containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and cell surface L-selectin expression was determined by flow cytometry. This assay was also carried out using PBMC (106 in 0.5 ml) within 90 min of isolation from buffy coat. PBMC (106 in 0.5 ml) were incubated in the presence or absence of inhibitor for 20 min followed by the addition of 1 μm LPS for 3 h. Inhibitors and LPS were removed by washing in PBS-CMF containing 5% FCS, and cell surface TNF-α expression was determined by flow cytometry. The washing and staining procedures for flow cytometric analysis were carried out on ice, using chilled buffer to prevent proteolytic cleavage of cell surface TNF-α after washing out of inhibitor. L-selectin was measured on mouse lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells by direct immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated MEL-14 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated FMC46, respectively. L-selectin and cell surface TNF-α on human PBMC were measured using two-color indirect immunofluorescence. LAM1.3 was used to detect L-selectin and 101/4 to detect TNF-α, followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1; fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-human CD14 was used to identify monocytes in PBMC. Cells were incubated with appropriate antibodies at each stage of staining for 20 min at 4 °C; mouse lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells were washed in PBS-CMF with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), and PBMC were washed in PBS-CMF with 5% FCS. Stained cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACStar Plus or FACS Vantage. Data for 10,000 events were collected for mouse lymphocytes or Jurkat T cells and 30,000–50,000 events (depending on the proportion of monocytes in the samples) for human mononuclear cells. Data were analyzed using FACSplot software developed by John Green, Computing Lab, NIMR, or using WinMDI (Joseph Trotter, Scripps Institute, CA). These assays were carried out as described in (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 96-well ELISA plates (Nunc, Maxisorb) were coated with MEL-14 (10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C, blocked for 60 min with Dulbecco's PBS with 1% bovine serum albumin, and washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Doubling dilutions (from 1/4) of supernatants from mouse lymphocytes (treated with PMA to induce L-selectin shedding in the presence or absence of inhibitor) were added to the plate and incubated for 90 min at room temperature. Captured L-selectin was detected using biotinylated T28.45 (5 μg/ml) and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO). The reaction was stopped with 2 mH2SO4, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. A standard curve was constructed using a mouse L-selectin-Ig fusion protein (LEC-Ig, generously provided by Dr. Susan Watson, Genentech) over the range of 0.75–100 ng/ml; absorbance values for an irrelevant fusion protein (mouse CTLA4-Ig; generously provided by Dr. Peter Lane, Basel Institute for Immunology, Basel) were subtracted from the standards and test samples. For mouse and human lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells, 100% inhibition was set as the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin in an untreated sample (after flow cytometric analysis) or the concentration of soluble L-selectin in the supernatant of an untreated cell sample (after ELISA); 0% inhibition was set at the appropriate value for a PMA-treated sample. For results from human monocytes, a different calculation was needed to allow direct comparison of L-selectin and TNF-α shedding. Therefore, in this case 100% inhibition was set as the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin in the presence of PMA + 50 μm Ro 31-9790 or the percentage of cells positive for cell surface TNF-α in the presence of LPS + 50 μmRo 31-9790 (doses of Ro 31-9790 which gave maximal inhibition); 0% inhibition was set as the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin or TNF-α in the presence of PMA or LPS, respectively. Intermediate percent inhibition was calculated as follows: %inhibition=(x−y)×100z−yEquation 1 where x = value for sample under test, y = value for sample set as 0%, z = value for sample set at 100%. Results are presented as percent inhibition ± S.E. for at least three replicates for each point. The IC50value for inhibitor in each system was defined as the concentration of inhibitor which gave 50% inhibition, where 100% inhibition was set as the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin or cell surface TNF-α in the presence of PMA + 50 μm Ro 31-9790 or LPS + 50 μm Ro 31-9790, respectively (doses of Ro 31-9790 which gave maximal inhibition) and 0% inhibition was set as the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin or TNF-α in the presence of PMA or LPS alone, respectively. We have shown previously that PMA-induced shedding of L-selectin from mouse lymphocytes is inhibited by the synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor Ro 31-9790 but not by the endogenous MMP inhibitor TIMP-1 (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These studies have been extended by including TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 in the same in vitro L-selectin shedding assay. Lymphocytes isolated from mouse lymph nodes were treated with PMA in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of each of the inhibitors, and L-selectin remaining on the cell surface was detected by flow cytometry. As reported previously, TIMP-1 had no effect on PMA-induced shedding of cell surface L-selectin at concentrations up to 1.1 μm (30 μg/ml) (Fig.1, A and B), whereas the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor Ro 31-9790 completely inhibited PMA-induced shedding at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 1 B). TIMP-2 was also unable to inhibit L-selectin shedding (Fig. 1, A and B), but TIMP-3 inhibited PMA-induced L-selectin shedding in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition at 0.8 μm (20 μg/ml; Fig. 1 B). To confirm that PMA was inducing shedding of L-selectin, rather than internalization, soluble L-selectin was quantitated by ELISA in supernatants from untreated, PMA-treated, and PMA + inhibitor-treated mouse lymphocytes. Although there was a background level of soluble L-selectin present in cell supernatants in the absence of PMA, an increase of approximately 100% was seen in response to phorbol ester (Fig. 1 C); this PMA-induced increase was inhibited completely by TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 but not by TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. This background level of L-selectin shedding, detectable as soluble L-selectin in the supernatants of untreated mouse lymphocytes, explains the >100% inhibition of PMA-induced shedding by TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 (Fig. 1 B); these inhibitors prevent both the PMA-induced and the background shedding, allowing cell surface L-selectin to increase to a level greater than that seen on untreated lymphocytes. However, even in the presence of TIMP-3 or Ro 31-9790 some residual soluble L-selectin can be detected in cell supernatants by ELISA. The TIMPs used in the experiments described above were recombinant human TIMPs. It was possible that the absence of inhibition of L-selectin shedding by TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 was caused by the inability of the human TIMPs to function in a mouse cell system. Therefore, the ability of the TIMPs to inhibit shedding of L-selectin from human cells was investigated. Jurkat T cells were treated with PMA in the presence and absence of inhibitors, and cell surface L-selectin was detected using direct immunofluorescence. As found for mouse lymphocytes, TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 inhibited PMA-induced shedding of L-selectin, whereas TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were without effect (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 (but not TIMP-1 or TIMP-2) inhibited L-selectin shedding from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, similar results were obtained with each of the TIMPs using both mouse and human cells. The cytokine TNF-α is a well characterized example of a cell surface molecule that is shed by proteolytic cleavage. This molecule is produced as a 26-kDa cell surface protein and is processed by zinc-dependent metalloproteinases to generate the 17-kDa soluble cytokine. We compared the abilities of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and Ro 31-9790 to inhibit shedding of L-selectin and TNF-α from human monocytes in order to investigate the relationship between these enzyme activities on the same cell. Human peripheral blood monocytes express L-selectin, therefore PMA was used to induce shedding, and cell surface L-selectin was measured as described for lymphocytes. Cell surface TNF-α is not normally detectable on monocytes. To measure the effect of metalloproteinase inhibitors on TNF-α shedding, monocytes were stimulated with LPS, to up-regulate TNF-α synthesis, and the level of TNF-α which accumulated at the cell surface, and which was released into the cell supernatant, in the presence and absence of inhibitors was determined. As found for lymphocytes, TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 (0.83 and 30 μm, respectively) blocked PMA-induced L-selectin shedding from human monocytes (Fig. 3 and TableII). TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 also mediated accumulation of TNF-α on the surface of human monocytes (Fig. 3 and Table II), indicating a block in the TNF-α shedding pathway. This accumulation of TNF-α on the cell surface was mirrored by decreased soluble TNF-α in supernatants of cells treated with LPS and TIMP-3 (data not shown). In contrast, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 had no effect on shedding of L-selectin from monocytes (Table II). TIMP-1 was also without effect on cell surface TNF-α on monocytes, but inclusion of TIMP-2 at 1.44 μm resulted in an increase in the percentage of cells positive for TNF-α, from 39.3% to 55.7% (31% inhibition), although this was less than that obtained with TIMP-3 (Table II).Table IIInhibition of L-selectin and TNF-α shedding from human monocytes by TIMP-3 and Ro 31–9790TreatmentL-selectin (PMA-treated)TNF-α (LPS-treated)%%Negative control0.50.5Untreated92.35.4Stimulated (PMA or LPS)1.239.3Stimulus + Ro 31–9790 (50 μm)85.786.6Stimulus + TIMP-1 (1.10 μm)1.938.3Stimulus + TIMP-2 (1.44 μm)3.355.7Stimulus + TIMP-3 (0.83 μm)99.195.5Cells were either treated with 100 nm PMA in the presence and absence of inhibitor and cell surface L-selectin was detected, or cells were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS in the presence and absence of inhibitor and cell surface TNF-α was detected by flow cytometry.

Results shown are the percentage of cells positive for L-selectin or TNF-α under each treatment and are representative of at least three experiments. The IC50 values obtained for TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 on each of the cell types tested are shown in Table III. TIMP-3 gave very similar IC50 values for inhibition of L-selectin shedding on all cell types tested (0.30–0.40 μm). However, this inhibitor prevented TNF-α shedding with a lower IC50 of 0.1 μm, indicating possible differences between TNF-α and L-selectin shedding activities. IC50 values obtained for Ro 31-9790 on L-selectin shedding showed more variation between cell types, but, like TIMP-3 this inhibitor was more potent in inhibiting TNF-α shedding on monocytes than inhibiting L-selectin shedding on any cell type tested. IC50 values obtained for both TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790 by measurement of soluble L-selectin released from mouse lymphocytes were similar to the values obtained by analysis of flow cytometry data (data not shown). The IC50for inhibition by TIMP-3 of soluble TNF-α release from LPS-stimulated human monocytes (0.17 ± 0.02 μm) was also similar to that obtained by measurement of cell surface TNF-α under identical conditions.Table IIIIC50 values for TIMP-3 and Ro 31–9790 on L-selectin and TNF-α sheddingActivityTIMP-3Ro 31–9790μmμmMouse lymphocyte L-selectin shedding0.31 ± 0.074.82 ± 0.75Jurkat L-selectin shedding0.37 ± 0.151.16 ± 0.27Human lymphocyte L-selectin shedding0.39 ± 0.210.70 ± 0.06Human monocyte L-selectin shedding0.39 ± 0.184.47 ± 1.27Human monocyte TNF-α shedding0.11 ± 0.040.38 ± 0.05Results are the mean ± S.E.

However, using a new category of MMP inhibitors based on hydroxamic acid, L-selectin shedding has been shown to be blocked in a variety of cell types in response to both physiological and nonphysiological stimuli (4Preece G.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 3093-3097PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that L-selectin shedding in these different circumstances is mediated by similar metalloproteinase dependent mechanisms. In this report, we extend our previous work and demonstrate that the endogenous metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP-3 inhibits L-selectin shedding from mouse and human lymphocytes and human monocytes. We have shown previously that TIMP-1 did not inhibit L-selectin shedding (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and we demonstrate here that the closely related inhibitor TIMP-2 is also ineffective. Some MMPs, and collagenase in particular, mediate limited L-selectin proteolysis (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that the L-selectin sheddase activity may be an MMP or an MMP-related enzyme. However, the work reported here and a previous study (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) demonstrate that phorbol ester-induced L-selectin shedding is not inhibited by two members of the TIMP family, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Between them, these two proteins inhibit the catalytic activity of all known MMPs, and the inability of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 to prevent shedding of L-selectin therefore suggests that L-selectin sheddase is not a known MMP. This is supported by the evidence that L-selectin sheddase is a cell-associated, rather than a soluble, activity (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Feehan C. Darlak K. Kahn J. Walcheck B. Spatola A.F. Kishimoto T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7019-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), as the MMPs are secreted enzymes. Recently, a subgroup of transmembrane MMPs (membrane-type MMPs or MT-MMPs) has been identified (26Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiko M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Like L-selectin sheddase, MT1-MMP is not inhibited by TIMP-1 (27Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, this cell surface enzyme can be excluded as a potential candidate for the L-selectin sheddase because it is inhibited by both TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 (27Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and the data presented here show that L-selectin shedding is not inhibited by TIMP-2. The hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors were originally designed as inhibitors of MMPs, and Ro 31-9790 inhibits recombinant human fibroblast collagenase (MMP1) with an IC50 of 4.9 nm. As described here and elsewhere, hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors prevent phorbol ester-induced shedding of cell surface L-selectin with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (4Preece G. Murphy G. Ager A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11634-11640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar,12Walcheck B. Kahn J. Fisher J.M. Wang B.B. Fisk R.S. Payan D.G. Feehan C. Betageri R.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 3093-3097PubMed Google Scholar) i.e. they are about 1,000-fold less potent in inhibiting L-selectin shedding in cell-based assays than in inhibiting recombinant MMPs in cell-free assays. When considered together with the inability of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 to inhibit L-selectin shedding from all of the cell types tested, it is unlikely that the L-selectin-shedding enzyme(s) is an MMP. Proteolytic cleavage of a number of other cell surface molecules, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (28Parvathy S. Oppong S.Y. Karran E.H. Buckle D.R. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), amyloid precursor protein (29Parvathy S. Hussain I. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M.

An enzyme has recently been cloned, called TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17) which correctly cleaves both a pro-TNF-α cleavage site peptide and full-length pro-TNF-α (20Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Bolani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J.

Becherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). In addition, leukocytes from TACE-deficient mice have a much reduced ability to secrete soluble TNF-α, suggesting an important role for TACE in mediating TNF-α shedding in vivo. TACE is a member of a recently characterized family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases known as the ADAM family (for review, see Ref. 30Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). An association between TACE and L-selectin shedding has recently been identified: thymocytes from TACE-deficient mice do not shed L-selectin in response to PMA stimulation. 2Peschon, J. J., Slack, J. L., Reddy, P., Stocking, K. L., Sunnarborg, S. W., Lee, D. C., Russell, W. E., Castner, B. J., Johnson, R. S., Fitzner, J. N., Boyce, R. W., Nelson, N., Kozlosky, C., Wolfson, M. F., Rauch, C. T., Cerretti, D. P., Paxton, R. J., March, C. J., and Black, R. A. (1998) Science 282,1281–1284. In addition, high concentrations of recombinant catalytic domain of TACE have been shown to cleave a peptide representing the cleavage site of L-selectin.2 This suggests that TACE may be a physiological L-selectin sheddase. A second member of the ADAM family (ADAM10) also cleaves a TNF-α cleavage site peptide but has yet to be shown to cleave full-length pro-TNF-α correctly (31Lunn C.A. Fan X. Dalie B. Miller K. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 32Rosendahl M.S. Ko C.S. Long D.L. Brewer M.T. Rosenzweig B. Hedl E. Anderson L.

We therefore investigated the possible relationship between enzymes mediating shedding of L-selectin and TNF-α by comparing the inhibitory profiles of the TIMPs and Ro 31-9790 on L-selectin and TNF-α shedding from human monocytes. We show here that TIMP-3 mediates accumulation of TNF-α on the surface of human monocytes in vitro. TIMP-1 has no effect, and TIMP-2 is less effective than TIMP-3. Solomon et al. (33Solomon K.A. Covington M.B. DeCicco C.P. Newton R.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4524-4531PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that although the level of cell surface TNF-α on human peripheral blood monocytes may not quantitatively reflect alterations in TNF-α shedding (because of degradation of unprocessed pro-TNF-α), this measurement can be used as a marker of inhibition of shedding at the time point utilized in our TNF-α-shedding assays (3 h). Measurement of soluble TNF-α in supernatants from monocytes stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of TIMP-3 gave an IC50 very similar to that obtained from cell surface expression. This indicates that both types of measurement can be used in our assay. Therefore differences can be found in the inhibitory profiles of the TIMPs and Ro 31-9790 on shedding of L-selectin and TNF-α from human monocytes and of Ro 31-9790 on shedding of L-selectin from different cell types, suggesting the potential involvement of more than one enzyme in these proteolytic events. However, it is also possible that the differences obtained result from differential accessibility of enzymes(s) to the inhibitors, particularly since shedding of the two proteins could not be investigated under identical experimental conditions. Interestingly, TIMP-3 has recently been reported to inhibit processing of a peptide encoding the cleavage site of pro-TNF-α by recombinant catalytic domain of TACE (34Amour A. Slocombe P.M. Webster A. Butler M. Knight C.G. Smith B.J. Stephens P. Shelley C. Hutton M. Knauper V. Docherty A.J.P. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). As in our cell-based assays, TIMP-1 had no effect on peptide proteolysis by TACE, and TIMP-2 was less effective than TIMP-3. Shedding of cell surface interleukin 6 receptor, which is sensitive to the hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors, has also recently been found to be blocked by TIMP-3 (35Hargreaves P.G. Wang F. Antcliff J. Murphy G. Lawry J. Russell G.G. Croucher P.I. Br. J. Haematol. 1998; 101: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The effect of TIMPs on the activity of other non-MMP zinc-dependent metalloproteinases is not known. Although the TIMPs are structurally homologous and can all inhibit the MMPs (except MT1-MMP) equally well, they exhibit different expression patterns, with TIMP-3 alone being restricted to the extracellular matrix (16Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of TIMP-3 to inhibit L-selectin shedding and TNF-α processing suggests either that TIMP-3 is functionally less specific than TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 or that it can more easily gain access to the L-selectin and TNF-α shedding enzymes and so inhibit their activity. TIMP-3 is the only TIMP that binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans, 3G. S. Butler and G. Murphy, unpublished observations. which are expressed at the cell surface, and binding to these glycosaminoglycans may localize TIMP-3 and enable interaction with cell surface metalloproteinases. There may be additional motifs within TIMP-3 which contribute to the ability of this protein, but not TIMP-1 or TIMP-2, to inhibit L-selectin shedding. Recent reports have shown that overexpression of TIMP-3 in some cell types results in increased apoptosis of the cells (36Smith M.R. Kung H.-F. Durum S.K. Colburn N.H. Sun Y. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 770-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 37Baker A.H. Zaltsman A.B. George S.J. Newby A.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). These studies used non-hemopoietic cells and time courses of several days, with little apoptosis occurring before 12–24 h of cell culture, whereas the assays reported here used much shorter incubations with TIMP-3 (1–3 h). However, to exclude the possibility that leukocytes are more sensitive to TIMP-3-induced apoptosis, we used an annexin V binding apoptosis assay to compare levels of apoptosis in TIMP-3-treated and control cell samples. No differences were found using either Jurkat T cells or human peripheral blood monocytes. 4G. Borland, G. Murphy, and A. Ager, unpublished observations. Thus, TIMP-3 does not appear to induce apoptosis of these cells within the times used in our assays. Shedding of many different cell surface proteins, in addition to L-selectin and TNF-α, is inhibited by hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors (18Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 19Mullberg J. Rauch C.T. Wolfson M.F. Castner B. Fitzner J.N. Otten-Evans C. Mohler K.M. Cosman D. Black R.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The close relationship between the shedding mechanisms involved in proteolytic cleavage of these molecules has been revealed through the use of a mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, defective in the shedding of transfected L-selectin, transforming growth factor-α, interleukin-6 receptor, β-amyloid precursor protein, and a number of unidentified endogenous proteins present in the supernatants of parental, but not mutant cells (18Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11376-11382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). There is evidence that this cell line differs from the parental line by alteration in only a single gene, suggesting that a common mechanism underlies shedding of many cell surface proteins, possibly a “pan-sheddase.” In support of this theory, TACE-deficient cells are also defective in the shedding of a number of other cell surface molecules, including L-selectin.2 Further studies identifying the sheddases for other metalloproteinase-cleaved cell surface molecules, including L-selectin sheddase, should clarify the relationship between the sheddases. The results presented here address this relationship and show differences in the susceptibility of L-selectin and TNF-α shedding to inhibition by the TIMPs and also in the IC50 values obtained with TIMP-3 and Ro 31-9790. This raises the possibility that shedding of L-selectin and TNF-α from human monocytes may be mediated by different enzymes, although other explanations exist.

In this study we investigate the interactions between the human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV-11) origin recognition and initiator protein E1 and human polymerase α/primase (pol α/primase) subunits. By using a variety of physical assays, we show that both 180- (p180) and 70-kDa (p70) subunits of pol α/primase interact with HPV-11 E1. The interactions of E1 with p180 and p70 are functionally different in cell-free replication of an HPV-11 origin-containing plasmid. Exogenously added p180 inhibits both E2-dependent and E2-independent cell-free replication of HPV-11, whereas p70 inhibits E2-dependent but stimulates E2-independent replication. Our experiments indicate that p70 does not physically interact with E2 and suggest that it may compete with E2 for binding to E1. A model of how E2 and p70 sequentially interact with E1 during initiation of viral DNA replication is proposed.

They cause papillomas in a wide variety of hosts and certain high risk human papillomavirus types are strongly linked to the development of cervical or penile cancer in humans (1zur Hausen H. de Villiers E.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 427-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The mode of viral replication is closely coupled to the differentiation status of the infected squamous epithelium (for review see Ref. 2Chow L.T. Broker T.R. Nathanson N. Viral Pathogenesis. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1997: 267-301Google Scholar). In the basal and parabasal cells of the squamous epithelium, the virus is maintained as a low copy number extra-chromosomal episome and undergoes regulated DNA replication modulated by both viral and host proteins. As cells undergo progressive differentiation, vegetative viral replication is triggered, “late” viral genes are expressed, and progeny virions are produced in a fraction of the terminally differentiated cells in papillomas or condylomas. The latent stage of papillomaviral replication provides an ideal system for the study of regulated eukaryotic DNA replication. We and others (3Yang L. Li R. Mohr I.J. Clark R. Botchan M.R.

Intervirology. 1994; 37: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), as well as the full complement of host replication proteins that have previously been identified in SV40 in vitro replication, including DNA polymerases α and δ (7Hassell J.A.

It is therefore probable that physical interactions between the host initiation enzymes and the papillomaviral initiation proteins E1 or E2 occur during initiation of viral DNA replication.

In addition to its role in initiation, HPV-11 E1 is also required during elongation in vitro, suggesting its helicase activity may be critical at the replicating forks (26Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). E2 is a viral transcriptional transactivator that is essential for viral DNA replication in vivo (27Ustav M. Stenlund A.

A. 1992; 89: 5799-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). It binds as a dimer with high affinity to its conserved binding sites (E2-binding site) in the viral genome, including several sites in the viral origin of replication (29McBride A.A. Byrne J.C.

Clark R. Sun S. Androphy E. MacPherson P. Botchan M. Science. 1990; 250: 1694-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and this E1·E2 complex has increased sequence specificity for binding to the E1 and E2 cognate sites in the viral origin (36Sedman J. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6218-6228Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 37Frattini M.G. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12398-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus one of the critical functions of E2 in viral DNA replication is to interact with and recruit E1 to the viral origin of replication by virtue of the stronger DNA binding affinity and specificity for E2 (20Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 35Mohr I. Clark R. Sun S. Androphy E. MacPherson P. Botchan M.

Therefore, the addition of E2 protein to a cell-free replication assay enhances ori-dependent and suppresses ori-independent replication. Based on these data the following model of E2/E1 interaction during initiation of bovine papillomaviral DNA replication has been proposed (20Lusky M. Hurwitz J. Seo Y.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Once the first molecule of E1 is loaded onto the origin by E2, E2 is then released from the origin, allowing E1 to multimerize into a replication-competent form. However, more recent studies in HPV replication have suggested that the role played by E2 extends beyond the recruitment of E1; E2 is necessary for the formation of the entire pre-initiation complex, although it is dispensable during elongation (26Liu J.-S. Kuo S.-R. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27283-27291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This interaction between E2 and E1 is extremely important for HPV ori replication, as only the E2-binding site is absolutely essential for origin-specific viral replication, whereas the E1-binding site is dispensable for in vivo or in vitro viral DNA replication (4Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chiang C.-M. Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 7131-7139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, certain heterologous combinations of E1 and E2 either do not support replication, or do so poorly, whereas the homologous pairs of viral proteins always support replication effectively (28Chiang C.-M. Ustav M. Stenlund A. Ho T.F. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5799-5818Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 40Berg M. Stenlund A. J.

DNA pol α/primase is the principal enzyme for the initiation of DNA synthesis and is required for both leading and lagging strand DNA replication (44Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 45Wang T.S.-F. De Pamphilis M. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells.

Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA pol α/primase has also been shown to be the major host factor responsible for species-specific replication of SV40 and polyomaviral DNA in vitro (54Stadlbauer F. Voitenleitner C. Brückner A.

These findings not only indicate the critical function of DNA pol α/primase in the initiation of viral DNA replication but also reveal the important role played by this enzyme complex in the timing and control of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. pol α/primase consists of four subunits as follows: a polymerase catalytic subunit of 180 kDa (p180), two smaller subunits of 58 and 49 kDa (p58 and p49) containing the primase activity, and a 70-kDa subunit (p70 or B-subunit) which is a cell cycle-dependent phosphoprotein (47Nasheuer H.-P.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 461-493Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit p180 has been shown to interact physically with both the SV40 T antigen (49Dornreiter I. Hoss A. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3329-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 50Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell.

Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p70 subunit has also been shown to interact physically with SV40 T antigen in vitro, although the functional significance of this interaction is not understood (53Collins K.L. Russo A.A.R. Tseng B.Y. Kelly T.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4555-4566Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase α activity is essential for the initiation of cell-free replication of SV40 (50Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell.

Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that analogous interactions between DNA pol α/primase and the host counterparts of the viral initiators may also play a critical role in the control of chromosomal DNA replication. In this report, we describe the physical and functional interactions between HPV-11 E1 and the catalytic subunit, p180, as well as the p70 subunit of human DNA pol α/primase. HPV-11 is the causative agent of genital condylomata and laryngeal papillomas and shares extensive sequence homology with the high risk HPV types. Thus, investigation of the homo-species interactions between the human pol α/primase subunits and the HPV E1 and E2 proteins will both advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of the initiation process of DNA replication in mammalian cells and also address potential therapeutic approaches to this family of prevalent human pathogens. By using biochemical and functional assays, we found that interactions between the E1 protein with both p180 and p70 are critical for the initiation of viral DNA replication. In addition, we showed that p70 may compete with E2 for binding to E1, suggesting a model of sequential interaction between the proteins during origin-dependent initiation of HPV-11 replication. The HPV-11 ori plasmid pUC7874-99 has been described (4Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chiang C.-M. Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5224-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Native HPV-11 E2 protein and HPV-11 E1 protein tagged at the amino terminus with the Glu-rich (EE) epitope from the polyomavirus middle T antigen (57Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Eckhart W. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells as described (4Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p180 was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using the monoclonal antibody SJK237-71 as described previously (58Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for the following modifications to accommodate the cell-free replication assay. After elution from the monoclonal antibody column with 3.2m MgCl2, the protein was dialyzed for two changes against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by dialysis for two changes against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. A final concentration step was performed by coating the dialysis tubing with dry G-50 Sephadex. The cloning of the 70-kDa subunit of DNA pol α/primase and the production in rabbit of anti-p70 polyclonal antibody will be described elsewhere. Five hundred-ml cultures of M15[pREP4] (Qiagen Inc.) transformed with an amino-terminal histidine-tagged p70 cDNA cloned into the pQE9 plasmid (Qiagen Inc.) were grown in 2× YT broth toA 595 = 0.7–0.9, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown for 2.5 h at 20 °C. Purification of overexpressed protein was carried out as described previously (59Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One-ml fractions were collected, and protein-containing fractions were immediately dialyzed against 10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for several changes. Protein was then concentrated via dialysis against 50% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Five μg of purified proteins were layered onto a 4-ml 10–30% (v/v) sucrose gradient in 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween and centrifuged for 6 h at 48,000 rpm at 15 °C in a Beckman SW60 rotor. Fractions (15 drops) were collected from the bottom of the tube using a 21-gauge needle. Ten μl of each fraction were combined with an equal amount of 2× SDS loading buffer and run on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The sucrose density of each fraction was measured. When indicated, equimolar amounts of E1 protein were incubated together on ice with p70 for 20 min prior to loading on the gradient. Western analysis was performed using either anti-EE monoclonal antibody against E1, or anti-p70 polyclonal antibody to determine the elution profile for each protein and compared with both internal standards (aldolase, 158 kDa) as well as to external standards run in a parallel gradient. When indicated, equimolar amounts of proteins were incubated together on ice for 20 min prior to loading onto the column. For analysis of the interaction between E1 and p70, 10 μg of each protein was applied to a Bio-Rad SE1000/17 column at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min in 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.1% Tween. Two hundred-μl fractions were collected, and 15 μl of each fraction was analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with either anti-EE monoclonal antibody for detection of E1 or anti-p70 polyclonal antibody. Gel filtration of p70 and E2 was performed using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech SMART® system. Two μg of each protein were preincubated for 20 min on ice prior to injection on a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Column was eluted at room temperature in the buffer system described above. Fifty-μl fractions were collected, and protein profiles were analyzed via Western blot using anti-p70 polyclonal antibody and anti-E2 polyclonal antibody. ELISA assays were performed as described (49Dornreiter I. Hoss A. Arthur A.K. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3329-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. One-half-μg of the primary protein was used to coat the 96-well plate. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, increasing amounts of the second protein were added, and incubation proceeded for 1 h. The plate was washed thoroughly 5 times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the second protein for 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and development proceeded as described previously (50Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five overlapping p180 fragments named 1α, 2α, 3α, 4α, and 5α constructed as GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (50Dornreiter I. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were constructed to allow polymerase chain reaction amplification of the Myc epitope from a previously existing construct. The primer for amplification of the 5′ side of the tag was constructed to contain anNheI site (5′ CGC CGC TAG CCA TGC TGA GGA GCA A 3′), and the primer for amplification of the 3′ side contains a BamHI site (5′ GCC GGC TAG CGG ATC CCA TAT GTA AGT CCT C 3′). The 113-base pair fragment resulting from this amplification contains two sequential Myc epitopes (EQKLISEED). This fragment was then cloned into theNheI-BamHI sites of pET11a (Novagen). Subsequent digestion with BamHI allowed the insertion of the coding sequence of the human p70 gene after liberation from pQE9-hup70 withBamHI digestion. Orientation and appropriate coding frame were confirmed through direct sequence analysis. Construction of pET-EE-E1 and pET-BB-E2 will be described elsewhere. 2L. T. Chow, unpublished results. BB epitope was derived from CMVpp65 (a phosphoprotein encoded by UL83 kindly suggested to us by Dr. William Britt). In vitro transcription and translation of pET-EE-E1 and pET-BB-E2 and pET-Myc-p70 were carried out using the Transcription and Translation-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System from Promega. Due to extreme inefficiency of labeling human p70 with either [35S]methionine or [35S]cysteine, this protein was labeled using l-[4,5- 3K. L. Conger and T. S. F. Wang, unpublished observation. H]leucine (156 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All other proteins were labeled using l-[35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, 15 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sf9 insect cells were grown to 80% confluence in a T-150 flask. They were then infected at 10 multiplicity of infection with baculovirus expressing either p180 (AcHDPα) (58Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22739-22748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or HPV-11 EE-E1 (4Kuo S.-R. Liu J.-S. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24058-24065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or co-infected with both viruses. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 20% ethylene glycol, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm of EDTA, β-mercaptoethanol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and sodium bisulfite, and lysed by sonication with a Branson Sonifier 450 with a 10-s pulse at 50% power three times. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 × g and incubated with increasing amounts of CNBr-Sepharose coupled to the anti-EE monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Beads were washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.04% Triton X-100 and then assayed for polymerase activity (60Fisher P.A. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6528-6535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. To the washed beads, 80 μl of assay mix was added, and the beads were gently rocked at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were then terminated, precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, and the acid-insoluble products were quantified as described previously (60Fisher P.A. Korn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6528-6535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins was performed as follows. Defined amounts of reticulocyte lysate containing the labeled protein of interest were mixed together in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% bovine serum albumin and allowed to rock gently at 4 °C for 30 min, after which 5 μg of antibody (either monoclonal anti-EE or polyclonal anti-p70) that had been pre-cleared by centrifugation in a TLS-55 at 100,000 × g for 30 min was added to the mixture. Incubation continued with rocking for 1 h, after which 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) was added and rocking continued overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100, resuspended in 2× SDS loading buffer, and run on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were fixed, soaked in “Amplify” (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried before being exposed to film. Suspension 293 cells were maintained in Joklik's medium with 5% calf serum. The preparation of whole cell extracts was modified from previously published protocols (61Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed S"
https://openalex.org/W2124055215,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 protein is the paradigm for eukaryotic ATP-dependent DNA strand exchange proteins. To explain some of the unique characteristics of DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51 protein, when compared with its prokaryotic homologue the Escherichia coli RecA protein, we analyzed the DNA binding properties of the Rad51 protein. Rad51 protein binds both single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in an ATP- and Mg2+-dependent manner, over a wide range of pH, with an apparent binding stoichiometry of approximately 1 protein monomer per 4 (±1) nucleotides or base pairs, respectively. Only dATP and adenosine 5′-γ-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) can substitute for ATP, but binding in the presence of ATPγS requires more than a 5-fold stoichiometric excess of protein. Without nucleotide cofactor, Rad51 protein binds both ssDNA and dsDNA but only at pH values lower than 6.8; in this case, the apparent binding stoichiometry covers the range of 1 protein monomer per 6–9 nucleotides or base pairs. Therefore, Rad51 protein displays two distinct modes of DNA binding. These binding modes are not inter-convertible; however, their initial selection is governed by ATP binding. On the basis of these DNA binding properties, we conclude that the main reason for the low efficiency of the DNA strand exchange promoted by Rad51 protein in vitro is its enhanced dsDNA-binding ability, which inhibits both the presynaptic and synaptic phases of the DNA strand exchange reaction as follows: during presynapsis, Rad51 protein interacts with and stabilizes secondary structures in ssDNA thereby inhibiting formation of a contiguous nucleoprotein filament; during synapsis, Rad51 protein inactivates the homologous dsDNA partner by directly binding to it.

Homologous recombination is a ubiquitous biological process. Elucidation of this process has come mostly from detailed analysis ofEscherichia coli RecA protein, a key enzyme in both homologous genetic recombination and recombinational repair of damaged DNA in the eubacteria. RecA-like proteins have been found in a variety of eukaryotes, from yeast to human. The first identified and the most extensively studied eukaryotic RecA protein-analog is the Rad51 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is establishing the paradigm for RecA protein-like functions in the eukaryotes. TheRAD51 gene of S. cerevisiae is required for mitotic and meiotic recombination (1Petes T.D. Malone R.E. Symington L.S. Broach J.R. Jones E. Pringle J.

Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, the most extensively investigated DNA pairing reaction is the three-strand exchange reaction, in which the pairing of circular ssDNA and homologous dsDNA yields nicked circular dsDNA and linear ssDNA. During the formation of a presynaptic complex in the first phase of the reaction, the RecA protein polymerizes on ssDNA in the 5′ → 3′ direction to form a right-handed helical structure in which the DNA is extended to 1.5 times its original length (8Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Pairing with homologous duplex DNA in the second phase of the reaction results in the rapid uptake of the dsDNA into homologous register and the associated exchange of DNA strands. Then, as a final step of the reaction, unidirectional branch migration completes the exchange of DNA strands (9Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). All DNA strand exchange proteins follow this general scheme for DNA strand exchange; however, the eukaryotic proteins (Rad51 protein forS. cerevisiae and human) display some unique characteristics (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5Sugiyama T.

A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The DNA strand exchange reaction is very sensitive to Rad51 protein concentration, and it occurs only in a narrow range of protein concentration, which corresponds to a stoichiometry of 3–4 nucleotides of ssDNA per Rad51 protein monomer; an excess of Rad51 protein severely inhibits DNA strand exchange (4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Another important distinction is that, in contrast to the RecA protein-promoted reaction, Rad51 protein-promoted DNA strand exchange is almost totally dependent on the presence of a ssDNA-binding protein, either eukaryotic replication protein-A (RPA) or prokaryotic ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) (4Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the presence of ATPγS, a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, the reaction requires a 6-fold excess of Rad51 protein above the aforementioned stoichiometric amount (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 12Sung P. Stratton S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27983-27986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the DNA binding properties of Rad51 protein from S. cerevisiae. These properties offer insight into the specific requirements for the DNA strand exchange reaction that were described above. All chemicals were reagent grade; solutions were made using Barnstead NANOpure water. ATP, ADP, CTP, UTP, GTP, dATP, TTP, dCTP, and dGTP were purchased from Sigma. ATPγS and AMP-PNP were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes, and their concentrations were determined using the following extinction coefficients: 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), 33 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 345 nm and ethidium bromide (EtBr), 5.5 × 103m−1 cm−1 at 546 nm (13Eggleston A.K. Rahim N.A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both ssDNA and dsDNA from M13 mp7 phage (viral (+) strand and replicative form I) were purified as described (14Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3399) Google Scholar). M13 dsDNA was linearized by digestion with EcoRI. Etheno M13 DNA was prepared as described (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For overproduction of the Rad51 protein in E. coli, theRAD51 gene was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter in the pET3a vector to form the plasmid pEZ5139. TheNde-BamHI fragment that contains the RAD51 gene was isolated from plasmid YEP13/Rad51-23 (16Basile G. Aker M. Mortimer R.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3235-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Because theRAD51 gene contains several sites for NdeI restriction endonuclease, the desired Nde-BamHI fragment (1470 bp) was reconstituted from two independently purified fragments,NdeI-Bsu36I (230 bp) andBsu36I-BamHI (1240 bp). Both fragments were ligated with the NdeI-BamHI-digested vector, pET3a (17Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). After transformation of E. coli strain DK1(ΔrecA), the authenticity of recombinant plasmid was confirmed by sequencing the entire RAD51 gene. Attempts to clone RAD51 gene under T7 promoter using any other expression vectors were unsuccessful, presumably due to both the high uninduced level of expression and the toxicity of Rad51 protein toE. coli. 2E.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SSB protein was purified as described (20LeBowitz J. Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication. Ph.D. Thesis. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore1985Google Scholar), and RPA was purified as described (5Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol.

S. cerevisiae Rad51 protein was purified from E. coli strain ENZ21 (aΔrecA derivative of BL21(DE3)), carrying both plasmids pEZ5139 and pLysS. The cells (80 g) from a 10-liter culture that was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h were resuspended in 200 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 600 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 0.1 mmbenzamidine. Cells were lysed by two cycles of freeze-thawing and by passage through a French pressure cell (Aminco Inc.). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The proteins were precipitated from the supernatant with ammonium sulfate (0.24 g/ml) and resuspended in 120 ml of P buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT), containing 50 mm KCl, 5 μg/ml AEBSF, 0.1 mm benzamidine. This solution was loaded at a flow rate of 120 ml/h onto an 80-ml Cybacron Blue-agarose column, equilibrated with P buffer. The column was washed with P buffer + 100 mm KCl until theA 280 approached zero, and then 200 ml of a 0.2–1 m KCl gradient was applied. Fractions containing Rad51 protein were combined and dialyzed against P buffer + 100 mm KCl, 5 μg/ml AEBSF, and 0.1 mmbenzamidine, and then loaded onto an 80-ml Q-Sepharose column, equilibrated with P buffer + 100 mm KCl. Proteins were fractionated with a 600-ml KCl gradient (200–800 mm KCl); Rad51 protein eluted at about 400 mm KCl. Pooled fractions were dialyzed against H buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 40 mm KCl) containing 5 μg/ml AEBSF and 0.1 mm benzamidine, and then loaded onto a 50-ml Bio-Gel hydroxyapatite column that was equilibrated with H buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of 20–200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) at a flow rate of 60 ml/h. Rad51 protein eluted at about 50 mm potassium phosphate. These fractions were pooled and diluted to bring the phosphate concentration to about 25 mm and then loaded onto a MonoQ (HR 10/10) column. A linear gradient (160 ml) of 200–600 mm KCl in P buffer was used to elute Rad51 protein (at about 400 mm KCl). Fractions containing purified Rad51 protein were dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml AEBSF, 0.05 mm benzamidine), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. The final yield of Rad51 protein was about 15 mg from 10 liters of culture. The concentration of Rad51 protein was calculated using an extinction coefficient (determined from amino acid composition) of 1.29 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. The purity of Rad51 protein was >99% based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rad51 protein was also purified from S. cerevisiae strain LP2749-B, harboring pR51.3 (kindly supplied by Dr. P. Sung) (3Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) using the same protocol described above for the isolation of Rad51 protein from E. coli. Rad51 protein was eluted from MonoQ column in two separate peaks: 70% of the protein eluted at about 400 mm KCl (analogously to Rad51 protein from E. coli) and 30% of the protein eluted at about 500 mmKCl. We believe, but have not investigated the possibility further, that the protein in the second peak could have been post-translationally modified (e.g. perhaps phosphorylated). The proteins from both peaks displayed similar DNA binding and DNA strand exchange activities. The yield of Rad51 protein purified from the yeast cells was about 3 mg from 80 g cells. Etheno M13 DNA fluorescence was measured by exciting at 300 nm and monitoring at 405 nm using an SLM-Aminco 8000 fluorescence spectrophotometer (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Protein titrations of etheno M13 DNA and salt titrations of the protein-etheno M13 DNA complexes were performed by adding aliquots of protein or concentrated salt (NaCl) solutions, respectively, to samples in reaction buffer (30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) or Na-MES (pH 6.2), 0.1 mm DTT, 10 mm magnesium acetate). The concentration of etheno M13 DNA was 3 μm nucleotides (or as indicated), and the concentration of nucleotide cofactors was 2 mm, unless otherwise indicated. An ATP-regenerating system (10 units/ml pyruvate kinase and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) was added to reactions with RecA protein but was omitted for Rad51 protein. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C with continuous stirring. The relative fluorescence increase (RFI) of etheno M13 DNA due to protein binding was measured as the ratio of the fluorescence increase upon the protein binding to the fluorescence of the free etheno M13 DNA and free protein. For salt titration experiments, the percentage of remaining protein-ssDNA complexes was determined by dividing the fluorescence of the protein-DNA complex, before salt titration, by the fluorescence of this complex after the salt titration (with corrections for dilution). The fluorescence of dsDNA-DAPI or dsDNA-EtBr complexes was measured by exciting at 359 nm and monitoring at 461 nm for DAPI, and 510 and 595 nm for EtBr, respectively (22Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 3E. N. Zaitsev and S. C. Kowalczykowski, submitted for publication. The binding of Rad51 protein or RecA protein to the dsDNA-DAPI (or dsDNA-EtBr) complexes causes the displacement of dye from the dsDNA, resulting in a fluorescence decrease. Reactions were performed in buffer containing either 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5) or 30 mmNa-MES (pH 6.2) and 0.1 mm DTT; magnesium acetate and ATP concentrations were as indicated. The concentration of DAPI was 200 nm and that of EtBr was 2 μm. The concentration of M13 dsDNA was 6 μm (nucleotides). The experiments were conducted at 37 °C with continuous stirring. The extent of Rad51 (RecA) protein binding to dsDNA was determined from the ratio of the observed fluorescence signal upon the addition of the protein, relative to the initial fluorescence of the DAPI-dsDNA complex. M13 DNA was mixed with varying concentrations of Rad51 protein in the indicated buffers in a total volume of 20 μl and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Depending on the experiment, magnesium acetate and ATP either were present in the buffer or were added subsequently. When added separately, magnesium acetate or ATP were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Sample loading buffer (3 μl of 40 mmTris acetate (pH 7.5), 50% glycerol, and a trace of bromphenol blue) was added to each sample, and the complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) at 120 V for 2 h and were visualized by EtBr staining. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, the binding of Rad51 protein to etheno M13 DNA results in an increase in the fluorescence of this modified M13 DNA (2Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). This increase reaches a maximum when the stoichiometric ratio between Rad51 protein and ssDNA corresponds to 1 monomer of Rad51 protein to approximately 4 (±1) nucleotides of ssDNA (Fig.1). The relative fluorescence increase (RFI) value for Rad51 protein is 3.6–3.8, a value that is slightly lower than that for RecA protein (4.2), with this preparation of etheno M13 DNA, and under the same experimental conditions. In the absence of ATP at pH 7.5, Rad51 protein does not show any significant increase in etheno M13 DNA fluorescence; this is unlike the behavior of RecA protein, which produces an RFI value in the absence of ATP of about 2 (not shown). The slight apparent increase in fluorescence upon addition of Rad51 protein in the absence of ATP shown in Fig. 1 is probably due to light scattering from aggregation of Rad51 protein. We discovered that preincubation of Rad51 protein in Tris acetate buffer at pH values higher than 7.0, containing 10 mmmagnesium acetate but without ATP, inactivates the protein with regard to DNA binding (Fig. 2). The subsequent addition of ATP to such inactivated protein failed to restore binding activity to Rad51 protein. However, the prior presence of ATP under these conditions prevents the inactivation of Rad51 protein; the fluorescence increase after addition of etheno M13 DNA is the same as in the protein titration experiment (see Fig. 1). The sensitivity of protein-DNA complexes to disruption by NaCl is a relative measure of the affinity of a protein for ssDNA (24Kowalczykowski S.C. Saenger W. Landolt-Bornstein: Numerical Data and Functional Relationships in Science and Technology (New Series) Group VII: Biophysics, Nucleic Acids. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 244-263Google Scholar). After formation of the Rad51 protein-etheno M13 DNA complex, its stability to dissociation by an increasing concentration of NaCl was examined. A decrease in fluorescence is observed upon the addition of NaCl until the complete dissociation of the protein-DNA complex occurs (Fig. 3). The salt titration midpoint for dissociation of the Rad51 protein in the presence of ATP and 10 mm magnesium acetate is about 550 mm NaCl; for comparison, the salt titration midpoint for RecA protein under identical conditions is about 700 mmNaCl (25Lauder S.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 72-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The effects of different nucleotide cofactors on the binding of Rad51 protein to etheno M13 DNA was investigated (TableI). In addition to ATP, for which the RFI value for the complex was 3.6–3.8 (Fig. 1 and Table I), only dATP and ATPγS support binding. In the presence of dATP, the RFI value is 2.6–2.8, but the apparent binding stoichiometry is the same as that obtained with ATP (data not shown). No change in the fluorescence of etheno M13 DNA upon addition of Rad51 protein was detected for any of the other NTPs (Table I), implying that either Rad51 protein does not bind ssDNA under these conditions or if binding does occur but there is no extension of the etheno M13 DNA to produce a fluorescence change. Etheno M13 DNA complex formation by Rad51 protein was sensitive to the ratio of ATP to ADP; in the presence of a mixture containing 1 mm ADP and 1 mm ATP, the RFI decreased by 25%, in the presence of 3 mm ADP and 1 mm ATP, the RFI decreased by 80% (Table I).Table IBinding of Rad51 protein to etheno M13 DNA depends on nucleotide cofactorNucleotide cofactorRelative fluorescence increaseATP3.6–3.8UTP1CTP1GTP1UTP1dATP2.6–2.8TTP1dCTP1dGTP1ATPγS1-aIn the presence of ATPγS, the observed RFI depends on the Rad51 protein concentration (reported in parentheses are values for 2-, 3-, and 5-fold excesses above the stoichiometric concentration, as described in the text).1.3 (1.9, 3, 3.3)AMP-PNP1ADP/ATP, 33%3.4ADP/ATP, 50%2.7ADP/ATP, 60%2.2ADP/ATP, 67%1.9ADP/ATP, 75%1.4ADP, 100%1The change in fluorescence was measured in 30 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and indicated cofactor (1 mm) after the addition of 1 μm Rad51 protein to 3 μmetheno M13 DNA at 37 °C.1-a In the presence of ATPγS, the observed RFI depends on the Rad51 protein concentration (reported in parentheses are values for 2-, 3-, and 5-fold excesses above the stoichiometric concentration, as described in the text). Open table in a new tab The change in fluorescence was measured in 30 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and indicated cofactor (1 mm) after the addition of 1 μm Rad51 protein to 3 μmetheno M13 DNA at 37 °C. Unlike RecA protein (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), ATPγS barely supported Rad51 protein binding to etheno M13 DNA, as indicated by the slight increase in fluorescence of etheno M13 DNA when a stoichiometric amount of Rad51 protein was present (RFI value of 1.3). However, ATPγS apparently binds to Rad51 protein and prevents ATP binding, since upon subsequent addition of ATP to the Rad51 protein/etheno M13 mixture that had been preincubated with ATPγS, no change in fluorescence was detected. However, addition of ATPγS to a preformed ATP-Rad51 protein-etheno M13 DNA complex resulted in a decrease in fluorescence (data not shown), suggesting that ATPγS could bind after ATP turnover. Increasing the Rad51 protein concentration above the stoichiometric ratio produced a substantial fluorescence signal in the presence of ATPγS; we observed RFI values of 1.3, 1.9, 3.0, and 3.3 at Rad51 protein concentrations that are 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5-fold higher than the stoichiometric ratio, respectively. In the presence of ATP and Mg2+, no significant changes in the binding activity of Rad51 protein to etheno M13 DNA were observed upon changing the pH values over the range of 6.0–8.5 (Fig.4). However, in the absence of ATP, an increase in etheno M13 DNA fluorescence upon Rad51 protein addition was detected only at pH values below 6.8. Furthermore, at these acidic pH values, the increase in etheno M13 DNA fluorescence upon the binding of Rad51 protein occurred in the absence of both nucleotide cofactor and magnesium ion. Without ATP and magnesium acetate, the maximum increase in etheno M13 DNA fluorescence is observed at pH 6.2, and no increase is detected at any pH values above 7.0. At a pH lower than 5.0, Rad51 protein seems to inactivate; an initial increase in fluorescence is seen immediately after Rad51 protein addition to the cuvette, but it gradually decreases to the fluorescence of free etheno M13 DNA (data not shown). The chemical nature of buffers did not affect the binding activity of Rad51 protein, because buffers with overlapping pH values (sodium citrate (pH 5.0–6.2), Na-MES (pH 5.8–7.2), and Tris acetate (pH 6.8–8.5)) showed no difference in RFI. Titrations of etheno M13 DNA with Rad51 protein at pH 7.5, pH 6.6, and pH 6.2 (Fig. 5) revealed that both the RFI value and the apparent binding stoichiometry are affected by pH and by the presence of both ATP and magnesium acetate. In the presence of ATP and magnesium ion, Rad51 protein binds to etheno M13 DNA over a wide range of pH (the RFI value is 3.8 over the pH range of 6.0–8.0 (Fig. 4)), with an apparent binding stoichiometry of 1 protein monomer per ≈4–5 nucleotides of etheno M13 DNA (Fig. 5). However, in the absence of both nucleotide cofactor and magnesium ion, the RFI value increases with decreasing pH (the RFI values are 1.3 at pH 7.5, 2 at pH 6.6, and 3.2 at pH 6.2 (see Fig. 4)), and the apparent binding stoichiometry of Rad51 protein changes from no obvious plateau, to 6:1, to 9:1 nucleotides of ssDNA per protein monomer (Fig. 5). The increase in RFI value with decreasing pH suggests either that the binding affinity of Rad51 protein to etheno M13 DNA is increasing or that the structure of the protein-DNA complex is changing. Since the salt titration midpoint is a relative measure of DNA binding affinity (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), the stability of Rad51 protein-etheno M13 DNA complexes, formed at different pH values, to disruption by NaCl was examined (Fig.6). The salt titration midpoint values are 60 mm NaCl and 110 mm NaCl at pH 6.6 and pH 6.2, respectively, indicating that the interaction of Rad51 protein with ssDNA in the absence of ATP and magnesium acetate is stronger at reduced pH. When compared with the results that were presented in Fig.3, it is evident that the stability of complexes formed in the presence of both ATP and magnesium acetate is higher than those formed in the absence of ATP cofactor and magnesium acetate (midpoints of 550 mm NaCl and 110 mm NaCl, respectively), which correspond to the behavior of RecA protein (15Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To verify these fluorescence measurements, Rad51 protein-native M13 ssDNA complexes were examined using a gel mobility shift assay (Fig.7). The mobility of Rad51 protein-ssDNA complexes, formed with increasing concentrations of Rad51 protein in the absence of ATP and magnesium acetate at pH 6.2, was different than the mobility of free DNA; this change in mobility paralleled the fluorescence titration shown in Fig. 5. Also in agreement with the fluorescence data, only a slight change in mobility of M13 ssDNA was observed upon addition of Rad51 protein at pH 7.5 in the absence of ATP and magnesium acetate, showing that the absence of an increase in fluorescence of etheno M13 DNA was due to an absence of complex formation and not just to a failure to induce a change in fluorescence.

https://openalex.org/W2041599486,"IGF-I is known to support growth and to prevent apoptosis in neuronal cells. Activation of the nuclear transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has emerged as a central determinant in neuronal functions. In the present investigation, we examined the IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, a cellular model for neuronal differentiation, and defined three distinct postreceptor signaling pathways important for this effect including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 and its transcriptional activation as measured by a CREB-specific Gal4-CREB reporter and the neuroendocrine-specific gene chromogranin A was induced 2–3.3-fold by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. This activation was significantly blocked (p < 0.001) by the dominant negative K-CREB or by mutation of the CRE site. IGF-I stimulated chromogranin A gene expression by Northern blot analysis 3.7-fold. Inhibition of MAPK kinase with PD98059, PI 3-kinase with wortmannin, and p38 MAPK with SB203580 blocked IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB by 30–50% (p < 0.001). Constitutively active and dominant negative regulators of the Ras and PI 3-kinase pathways confirmed the contribution of these pathways for CREB regulation by IGF-I. Cotransfection of PC12 cells with p38β and constitutively active MAPK kinase 6 resulted in enhanced basal as well as IGF-I-stimulated chromogranin A promoter. IGF-I activated p38 MAPK, which was blocked by the inhibitor SB203580. This is the first description of a p38 MAPK-mediated nuclear signaling pathway for IGF-I leading to CREB-dependent neuronal specific gene expression. IGF-I is known to support growth and to prevent apoptosis in neuronal cells. Activation of the nuclear transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has emerged as a central determinant in neuronal functions. In the present investigation, we examined the IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, a cellular model for neuronal differentiation, and defined three distinct postreceptor signaling pathways important for this effect including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 and its transcriptional activation as measured by a CREB-specific Gal4-CREB reporter and the neuroendocrine-specific gene chromogranin A was induced 2–3.3-fold by insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. This activation was significantly blocked (p < 0.001) by the dominant negative K-CREB or by mutation of the CRE site. IGF-I stimulated chromogranin A gene expression by Northern blot analysis 3.7-fold.

This is the first description of a p38 MAPK-mediated nuclear signaling pathway for IGF-I leading to CREB-dependent neuronal specific gene expression.

IGF-I is involved in the growth and differentiation of various cell types such as muscle and adipocytes (1Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol.

Although liver is the primary source of circulating IGF-I, significant expression of this growth factor is seen in various tissues including brain, where it is known to exert autocrine and paracrine functions (4Ishii D.N.

Neurobiol. 1996; 13: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). IGF-I exerts its cellular effects through its type I IGF receptor which resembles the insulin receptor in structural as well as functional aspects (reviewed in Refs. 6LeRoith D. Werner H.

This heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein consists of two α- and two β-subunits. The β-subunit has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is stimulated when IGF-I binds to the α-subunits. The receptor tyrosine kinase in turn phosphorylates intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 and Shc (7Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar, 8He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.-M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol.

The tyrosine phosphorylation sites on these docking proteins recruit Src homology 2-containing proteins such as Grb2, Nck, Crk, SHP2, and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. From this intermediary complex of signaling proteins, two significant pathways emerge. One pathway activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) through Ras/Raf/MEK, and another pathway proceeds through PI 3-kinase. IGF-I has been studied extensively in the PC12 cell line, a model of neuronal tissue. In these cells, IGF-I promotes growth and proliferation, primarily via activation of the ERK pathway (9Foncea R. Andersson M. Ketterman A. Blakesley V. Sapag-Hagar M. Sugden P.H. LeRoith D. Lavandero S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19115-19124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). For the prevention of apoptosis, IGF-I requires the PI 3-kinase pathway (10Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). One of the common nuclear targets of tyrosine kinase signaling cascades is CREB, the Ca2+/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein. CREB is a 43-kDa nuclear transcription factor belonging to the CREB/ATF family (11Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of CREB by forskolin, a potent stimulator of cAMP, stimulates PC12 cell differentiation to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype with neurite extension (12Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E.

IGF-I is known to regulate a number of CREB response element (CRE)-containing genes including bcl-2 and c-fos(21Parrizas M. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1355-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Monnier D. Boutillier A.L. Giraud P. Chiu R. Aunis D. Feltz P. Zwiller J. Loeffler J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CREB is constitutively expressed, and it binds to the specific sequence, 5′-TGACGTCA-3′ known as CRE. Phosphorylation on the serine 133 residue of CREB increases its transcriptional activity. This phosphorylation does not alter the binding of CREB to CRE, but it increases its association with adapter proteins such as CREB-binding protein, leading to the activation of transcriptional machinery. CREB was initially identified as a substrate for PKA and a mediator of cAMP-regulated gene expression (23Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Later studies showed that CREB can be phosphorylated and activated by multiple signaling pathways including ERK, protein kinase C, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, and p38 MAPK (12Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 24Xie H. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1717-1723PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sheng M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Thus, diverse signaling pathways, many of which are activated by IGF-I, are capable of regulating this transcription factor, which plays a role in neuronal growth and survival. Chromogranin A is an acidic glycoprotein present in secretory granules of the neuroendocrine system (27Wu H. Mahata S.K. Mahata M. Webster N.J.G. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The promoter region of this gene has a conserved CRE site, which is essential for transactivation in PC12 cells (28Tang K. Wu H. Mahata S.K. Taupenot L. Rozansky D.J. Parmer R.J. O'Connor D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28382-28390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chromogranin A, being a physiologically relevant CRE-dependent gene, can serve as a read-out for IGF-I-mediated gene regulation in PC12 cells. We recently demonstrated an ERK-dependent CREB activation by insulin in Hep-G2 and 3T3-L1 cell lines (29Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since CREB is capable of regulating many important functions in neuronal tissues, we investigated whether CREB was important for IGF-I-mediated gene regulation in PC12 cells. The objectives of this investigation were to (a) examine whether IGF-I stimulates the phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB in PC12 cells, (b) gain insight into the mechanism by which IGF-I-mediated signal transduction pathways lead to the activation of CREB, and (c) assess the impact of IGF-I on the neuronal specific CRE-dependent gene chromogranin A. We demonstrate that IGF-I increases CREB serine 133 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation of CREB reporter systems and the neuronal specific gene chromogranin A through at least three pathways: PI 3-kinase, MEK/ERK, and p38 MAPK. The novel finding of this study is the contribution of the p38 MAPK-mediated signaling pathway to the regulation of CREB-dependent gene expression by IGF-I. PD98059, wortmannin, and rapamycin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). SB203580 and SB202190 were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell culture media and supplies were from Life Technologies, Inc. and Gemini Bio Products, Inc. (Calabasa, CA). The plasmid for the expression of the chimeric protein (Gal4-CREB) consisting of the DNA binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of CREB and the expression vector for Gal4-CREB protein with serine to alanine substitution at position 133 were a generous gift from Dr. William J. Roesler (University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada).

Antibody to p38 MAPK (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and the dual phosphorylation site-specific antibody to p38 MAPK was a gift from Dr. Eric Schaefer (Promega). Plasmids for transfection experiments were purified using Qiagen's (Valencia, CA) Maxi kit. All other fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells (provided by Dr. Gary Johnson (Denver, CO) and Drs. Derek LeRoith and Marcelina Parrizas (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 microunits/ml penicillin at 37 °C. The cells were cultured in 60-mm dishes for immunoblotting experiments and in 6 × 35-mm wells for transfection studies. Medium was changed every second day. Confluent cell cultures were split 1:4 and used for the experiments 4 days later. The cells were fasted for 5 h by maintaining them in the medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% heat-inactivated horse serum before treatment with growth factors and other agents in the experiments for measuring CREB phosphorylation. The stock solutions of pharmacological inhibitors such as PD98059, wortmannin, and SB203580 were prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 1000-fold, so that when they were added to the culture medium, the concentration of Me2SO was below 0.1%. Immunoblotting for CREB, phospho-CREB, p38 MAPK, and dual phospho-p38 MAPK were carried out as described previously (29Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E-B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). PC12 cells cultured in 60-mm dishes were fasted for 5 h before each experiment. After preincubation with inhibitors for 30 min and incubation with growth factors for appropriate duration, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were prepared by scraping the cells with 200 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mmdithiothreitol. The proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were blocked with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 8.5% NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk (blotting grade) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were then treated with the primary antibody for P-CREB in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After three washes with blocking buffer, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by three washes with blocking buffer, two washes with 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, and a 5-min incubation with diluted CDP-Star reagent (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and then exposed to x-ray film. The membranes were then stripped in the buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and reprobed with antibody for CREB by a similar procedure. The intensity of the bands was quantitated by scanning. The extent of CREB phosphorylation was measured by calculating the ratio of P-CREB and CREB bands. For phospho-p38 and p38, the blots were incubated with the primary antibody against dually phosphorylated p38 (Promega anti-active p38; 140 ng/ml) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. This was followed by three washes in TBST and incubation with diluted ECL chemiluminescent reagent for 1 min. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with antibody against p38 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 50 ng/ml). The cells were treated with IGF-I and inhibitor as described in the figure legends. After washing the cells with PBS, 200 μl of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added. The cells were scraped, lysed by sonication, and centrifuged for 20 min to collect the supernatant. The lysate (300 μg) was mixed with 4 μl of p38 MAPK antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (20 μl) was added and gently rocked for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mmMgCl2). The pellet was suspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× Laemmli sample buffer. These samples were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with antibody to phospho-ATF-2. The intensities of the bands were measured by scanning. PC12 cells (90% confluence) were cultured in fasting medium in the absence and presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I for 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from these cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA samples were fractionated on denaturing 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane. The 1.6-kilobase pairXhoI/EcoRI insert of rat chromogranin A cDNA probe was labeled with thermostable alkaline phosphatase using the AlkPhos-Direct kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Hybridization, washing, and detection by CDP-Star were performed according to manufacturer's protocol. The blots were stripped and reprobed with labeled β-actin by a similar protocol. The expression of chromogranin A was normalized to β-actin expression. The PC12 cells were cultured to 60–80% confluence for transfection experiments in 6 × 35-mm plates. For each well, 2 μg of plasmids and 20 μg of LipofectAMINE reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used as per the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter was included to normalize the transfection efficiency. DNA and the LipofectAMINE reagent were diluted separately in 100 μl of serum-free medium without antibiotics, mixed together, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The culture plates were washed with PBS and 800 μl of serum, and antibiotic-free medium was added. The 200 μl of the plasmid LipofectAMINE mixture was then added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Then 1.0 ml of high serum medium (20% fetal bovine serum and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum) was added and incubated for approximately 40 h before induction with growth factors for luciferase. After 4 h of induction, the cells were washed in PBS and lysed with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer. In the case of chromogranin A promoter constructs, the induction was 24 h after transfection for a period of 30 h. The cells were lysed by freezing and thawing, and lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was used for the assay of luciferase and β-galactosidase. Luciferase assays were carried out using the enhanced luciferase assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) on a Monolight 2010 luminometer. The β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the method of Wadzinski et al. (31Wadzinski B.E. Wheat W.H. Jaspers S. Peruski L.F. Lickteig R.L. Johnson G.L. Klemm D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2822-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was carried out by Student's ttest. The nuclear transcription factor CREB was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner in response to IGF-I. There was a 2.3-fold (p < 0.001) increase in CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 (Fig.1 A) at 10 min when PC12 cells were stimulated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml). The phosphorylation returned to near basal level by 120 min. The protein level of CREB did not change during this 2-h period in the presence of IGF-I. The time course of CREB phosphorylation mediated by IGF-I was comparable with that of insulin in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts as reported earlier (29Klemm D.J. Roesler W.J. Boras T. Colton L.A. Felder K. Reusch J.E-B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 917-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The dose-response curve shows a significant increase in CREB phosphorylation at 10 ng/ml (p < 0.05) with dose-dependent increases at higher concentrations (Fig.1 B). We observed an additional band with the antibody specific for the phosphorylation sequence around serine 133 of CREB. Serine 63 phosphorylation of ATF-1 is known to be detected by the same antibody as serine 133-phosphorylated CREB, since they are 100% homologous for this consensus phosphorylation sequence (32Iordanov M. Bender K. Ade T. Schmid W. Sachsenmaier C. Engel K. Gaestel M. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation pattern of ATF-1 was parallel to that of CREB in terms of both intensity and time course. To explore the role of different signaling pathways in CREB phosphorylation, we examined the effect of PD98059 (an inhibitor of MEK) and wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase) on IGF-I-induced CREB phosphorylation. In addition, we examined the effects of SB203580 and SB202190, two specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK (33Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3113) Google Scholar, 34Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). This protein kinase has been shown to mediate the effects of fibroblast growth factor and NGF on CREB phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, preincubation of PC12 cells with PD98059 (30 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm) resulted in a 25–30% decrease in IGF-I-mediated CREB phosphorylation at serine 133. The addition of 30 μm PD98059 decreased the induction of ERK1/2 MAPK activity as detected by dual phospho-ERK antibody (Promega, Madison, WI) (data not shown). The findings with wortmannin clearly indicate that the PI 3-kinase mediates IGF-I-induced nuclear signaling in addition to the regulation of cytosolic proteins such as glycogen synthase. The inhibitors of p38 MAPK, SB203580 (10 μm), and SB202190 (10 μm) were able to decrease the CREB phosphorylation stimulated by IGF-I significantly (p < 0.001), suggesting a novel pathway for nuclear signaling of this growth factor. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase, which is one of the downstream components of the PI 3-kinase signaling system, had no significant impact on IGF-I-induced CREB phosphorylation. The neurotrophic actions of IGF-I are similar to those of NGF in PC12 cells. Therefore, we compared the effects of IGF-I and NGF on CREB phosphorylation. The partial reduction in NGF-mediated CREB phosphorylation in the presence of individual inhibitors was similar to that of IGF-I (data not shown) with the minor difference that PD98059 was more effective than wortmannin in decreasing NGF-induced CREB phosphorylation. In some experiments, combinations of inhibitors were shown to block the effects of growth factors completely (Fig.2 B). For example, in the presence of wortmannin (100 nm) and SB203580 (10 μm), IGF-I did not increase CREB phosphorylation above basal level. The inhibitors PD98059 (30 μm) and SB203580 (10 μm) used together blocked NGF action. For the remainder of the studies, parallel experiments were conducted with NGF as a control. The NGF data will only be presented for selected experiments. The experiments with pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that multiple signaling pathways mediate IGF-I-induced phosphorylation of CREB, including ERK, PI 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK. Growth factors have been shown to activate p38 in neuronal cell lines (26Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 35Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Because the pharmacological inhibition of p38 with the SB compounds suggested a role for p38, we examined p38 activity in response to IGF-I in these cells. To examine whether IGF-I activates p38 MAPK in PC12 cells, experiments were carried out to measure the formation of phospho-p38 MAPK, the active form of this enzyme. As shown in Fig.3 A, IGF-I increased the phosphorylation of p38 significantly (p < 0.001) over the untreated cells in 5 min and slowly decreased over the remaining 2-h incubation period. Sodium arsenite is a known stimulator of p38 MAPK activity, and it serves as a control for the immunoprecipitation kinase assay. When p38 MAPK was assayed in PC12 cells treated with IGF-I (100 ng/ml) and sodium arsenite (300 μm) by immunoprecipitation followed by phosphorylation of ATF-2 phosphoprotein, 78 and 145% increases in the enzyme activity were observed, respectively. Pretreatment of cells with the inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm) decreased the stimulated enzyme activity significantly (p < 0.01). CREB was initially described as a substrate for protein kinase A (23Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the role of protein kinase A in IGF-I induced CREB phosphorylation using H89, a pharmacologic inhibitor that specifically inhibits this kinase (data not shown). This inhibitor decreased the formation of P-CREB mediated by dibutyryl cAMP (500 μm) and forskolin (10 μm) significantly (p < 0.001). H89 did not block IGF-I and NGF-mediated increases in P-CREB formation. CREB phosphorylation at serine 133 is essential for transcriptional activation, but under some conditions this phosphorylation is inadequate to drive transcription (37Lee C.Q. Yun Y. Hoeffler J.P. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4455-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, it was essential to determine whether IGF-I-mediated CREB phosphorylation enhanced its transcriptional activation. For initial experiments, we used a Gal4-TK-Luc reporter system specific for the transactivation of CREB. Since endogenous transcription factors do not bind to the promoter pGal4-TK-Luc, the increase in luciferase activity"

We have identified the binding domain in hsp90 for cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) using a two-hybrid system screen of a mouse cDNA library. All isolated clones encoded the intact carboxyl terminus of hsp90 and overlapped with a common region corresponding to amino acids 558–724 of murine hsp84. The interaction was confirmed in vitro with bacterially expressed CyP40 and deletion mutants of hsp90β and was delineated further to a 124-residue COOH-terminal segment of hsp90. Deletion of the conserved MEEVD sequence at the extreme carboxyl terminus of hsp90 precludes interaction with CyP40, signifying an important role for this motif in hsp90 function. We show that CyP40 and Hop display similar interaction profiles with hsp90 truncation mutants and present evidence for the direct competition of Hop and FK506-binding protein 52 with CyP40 for binding to the hsp90 COOH-terminal region. Our results are consistent with a common tetratricopeptide repeat interaction site for Hop and steroid receptor-associated immunophilins within a discrete COOH-terminal domain of hsp90. This region of hsp90 mediates ATP-independent chaperone activity, overlaps the hsp90 dimerization domain, and includes structural elements important for steroid receptor interaction.

Hop provides the essential link between hsp70 and hsp90 and binds the chaperones simultaneously through favored interactions with ADP-bound forms of both proteins (37Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J.

After dissociation of Hop and hsp70, ATP-dependent conversion of hsp90 to the ATP-bound conformer promotes recruitment of p23 and one of the immunophilins to generate mature receptor complexes (23Prapapanich V.

Although a precise role for p23 and the immunophilins in receptor complexes has yet to be defined, evidence that these accessory proteins are capable of independent chaperone activity (39Bose S.

Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that they might modulate receptor function either directly or indirectly via hsp90. The majority of accessory proteins that participate in the chaperone-mediated assembly of steroid receptors possess structurally related TPR motifs that mediate their interaction with hsp90 and/or hsp70 (11Hoffman K.

Genetic studies in yeast have confirmed that hsp90 is an essential component for the activity of diverse intracellular signaling molecules including steroid receptors and regulatory tyrosine kinases involved in cell cycle control (for review, see Ref. 25Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). A role for CyP40 in hsp90 regulatory function has been demonstrated by studies in which deletion of Cpr7, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae homolog of CyP40, resulted in greatly reduced activities of both glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors and pp60v-src kinase expressed in yeast (45Duina A.A. Chang H.-C.J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To date one of our approaches to determining the function of CyP40 and its partner immunophilins has been to study their in vitrointeraction with the known chaperone components of steroid receptor complexes. In this way we have identified hsp90 (14Ratajczak T. Carrello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and hsp70 2A.

In this way the immunophilin domain of FKBP52 has been used successfully in a yeast two-hybrid screen to isolate FAP48, a novel protein that may represent a common natural ligand for FKBPs (48Chambraud B.

Here, we show that use of the yeast-based genetic assay, in combination with the COOH-terminal TPR domain of CyP40 (amino acids 185–370), led predominantly to the isolation of interacting clones that corresponded to hsp90 cDNAs encoding the COOH-terminal dimerization domain of hsp90. In vitro binding assays with deletion mutants of this region located the interaction site for CyP40 to a 124-residue COOH-terminal segment of hsp90 and confirmed that this region incorporates the common TPR binding site for the immunophilins and Hop. Deletion of the acidic EEVD motif, conserved at the carboxyl terminus of hsp90 proteins, precluded CyP40 and Hop interaction, consistent with a regulatory role of this microdomain in hsp90 function. pBTM116-CyP40 185–370 contains the carboxyl half of CyP40 fused in-frame to the DNA binding domain of LexA (amino acids 1–202). The COOH-terminal portion of human CyP40, encoding residues 185–370, was amplified by PCR using primers that introduced anEcoRI site at the 5′-end and a termination codon with anEcoRI site at the 3′-end. Subcloning of this fragment into pGEM 3Z (Promega) at the EcoRI restriction enzyme site allowed confirmation of sequence integrity by automated sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). The EcoRI fragment was then ligated into the corresponding restriction site in the bait vector pBTM116 (49Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), in-frame with the LexA DNA binding domain to give pBTM116-CyP40 185–370. The plasmid for the protein GST-bCyP40 WT has been described (14Ratajczak T. Carrello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For untagged wild-type bovine CyP40, a bCyP40 cDNA template was amplified by PCR using sequence-specific oligonucleotide 5′- and 3′-primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, respectively. A TGA stop codon was placed immediately before the BamHI site. The PCR fragment was ligated into pGEM-T (Promega), and the sequence integrity of both ends of the insert in an isolated clone was confirmed by automated sequence analysis (Applied Biosystems). An XhoI to BclI fragment excised from a wild-type bCyP40 cDNA was replaced to eliminate PCR-generated errors within this region. A full-length bCyP40 fragment produced by NdeI and BamHI digestion was then cloned into the pET-11 plasmid vector. The pET-11-bCyP40 WT expression plasmid was transformed into the E. coli expression host BL21(DE3). Overexpression of wild-type bovine CyP40 was induced by 0.4 mm IPTG, and lysates of recombinant CyP40 were prepared as described below. Expression plasmids for human hsp90β (50Shi Y. Brown E.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), FKBP52 (10Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. De Cenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and Hop were kindly provided as gifts by C. T. Walsh, D. A. Peattie, and D. F. Smith, respectively. An identical cloning strategy was used to generate NH2-terminal His-tagged expression plasmids for hsp90β deletion mutants incorporating codons 530–724, 581–724, 600–724, 530–700, and 530–719. Each construct was PCR amplified from pET-15b-hsp90β (50Shi Y. Brown E.D. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) full-length cDNA template using Taq DNA polymerase with primers that introduced anNdeI site at the 5′-end and a termination codon with anNdeI site at the 3′-end. The PCR fragment was ligated into pGEM-T and was then excised with NdeI digestion from a suitable clone confirmed for sequence fidelity. The gel-purified fragments were cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector that had been linearized with NdeI to give the expression plasmids pET-28a(+) 530–724β, pET-28a(+) 581–724β, pET-28a(+) 600–724β, pET-28a(+) 530–700β, and pET-28a(+) 530–719β. The expression plasmid pET-28a(+) 589–732α was prepared for the NH2-terminal His-tagged hsp90α deletion mutant encompassing residues 589–732. The plasmid was derived by PCR from a full-length human hsp90α cDNA template (51Yamazaki M. Tashiro H. Yokoyama K. Soeda E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3163-3170PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided K. Yokayama) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and specific oligonucleotide primers with built-in NheI (5′-end) andBamHI (3′-end) restriction sites. The BamHI site was preceded by a termination codon. Subcloning of the blunt ended PCR fragment into SmaI-digested pGEM 3Z vector allowed confirmation of sequence integrity. The fragment was excised withNheI and BamHI and ligated into vector DNA to give pET-28a(+) 589–732α. Two-hybrid system reagents including the mouse embryo cDNA library in pVP16, the S. cerevisiae reporter strain L40, and screening methodology were as described previously (49Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 52Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collis S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Briefly, S. cerevisiae L40 cells were transformed sequentially with pBTM116-CyP40 185–370 and the library, and the yeast transformants were plated on histidine-deficient medium. Of the 40 × 106 yeast transformants screened, some 300 were identified as histidine prototrophs of which 150 were selected for assessment of β-galactosidase activity. 28 His+,LacZ+ colonies were grown in liquid medium deficient in leucine and were used to generate crude plasmid DNA preparations. These were transformed into competent Escherichia coli HB101 cells allowing selection of colonies containing library hybrid plasmids. Purified minipreparations of the resultant clones were transformed into L40 yeast cells simultaneously with pBTM116-CyP40 185–370 bait plasmid, and the transformants were assayed for β-galactosidase activity. To reduce the risk of false positives, parallel transformations were performed with individual library plasmids alone or in combination with pBTM116, 3E. Ingley, manuscript in preparation. pBTM116-ARL-E1, and pBTM-LYN as negative controls. cDNA inserts in library pVP16 plasmids, isolated from clones considered to be true positives, were sequenced using both a sense (5′-GAGTTTGAGCAGATGTTTA-3′) and antisense M13 universal primer (Applied Biosystems). 10 murine hsp84-related cDNAs (53Moore S.K. Kozak C. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Appella E. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 56: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were recovered from the true positive clones. The expression plasmid for GST-bCyP40 WT fusion protein was transformed into E. coli strain XL-1 Blue, and the protein was purified from lysates of bacterial cultures by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as detailed previously (14Ratajczak T. Carrello A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for FKBP52 was transformed in E. colipVX28 (10Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. De Cenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). All other expression constructs used in this study were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant CyP40, Hop, FKBP52, and hsp90β proteins were overexpressed in bacterial cultures by induction with IPTG. Lysates were prepared by sonicating bacterial cells in lysing buffer (CyP40, Hop: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, containing 100 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% v/v Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme; FKBP52 and hsp90α and β: 50 mm disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, pH 7.4, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and were cleared of particulate material by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). For expression of His-tagged hsp90α and β deletion mutants, bacterial cells harboring these clones were pelleted from overnight cultures (150 ml) by centrifugation. After resuspension in 1.5 liters of fresh 2 YT medium containing 200 μg/ml kanamycin, the bacteria were incubated with shaking for a further 1 h at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG over a 4-h period. Centrifugation gave a bacterial pellet that was resuspended in 20 ml of lysing buffer (as described for FKBP52, hsp90β). The freeze-thawed bacteria were sonicated on ice, and the lysates were recovered by ultracentrifugation as already described. All His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified from crude lysates by chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Unbound proteins were removed from the chelate-agarose gel (0.5 ml) by 10 successive washes with 50 mm disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, pH 7.4 buffer, containing 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The first wash also contained 1% v/v Triton X-100. Gel charged with immobilized His-tagged proteins was stored at 4 °C for use in protein binding studies, or the absorbed protein was recovered by elution with the same buffer (1 ml) containing 500 mm imidazole. Recovered proteins were assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining, and after equilibration by dialysis against binding buffer (10 mmTris pH 7.3, containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mmdithiothreitol) they were stored in 200-μl aliquots at −70 °C until required. Direct binding studies between wild-type hsp90β and truncated hsp90 mutants with recombinant CyP40 and Hop were conducted in parallel. Briefly, chelate-agarose gels containing immobilized hsp90-related proteins were equalized for protein content by diluting up to 3-fold with Sepharose 4B. The diluted gels were prepared in duplicate 50-μl aliquots, and each set of duplicates was rotated for 3 h at 4 °C with IPTG-induced bacterial lysates for CyP40 (150 μl) or Hop (200 μl). Both lysates had been equilibrated previously in binding buffer plus 35 mm imidazole. The inclusion of imidazole to 35 mm concentration was found to be effective in limiting nonspecific protein interaction with control chelate-agarose gel devoid of hsp90-related proteins. The gels were subjected to replicate washes (8 × 500 μl) with binding buffer plus 35 mmimidazole, the first 5 washes being supplemented with 0.2% v/v Triton X-100. Gel-retained proteins were recovered by boiling in 40 μl of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% w/v polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. In a reciprocal binding study, glutathione-agarose containing absorbed GST-bCyP40 WT fusion protein was diluted 5-fold with Sepharose 4B, and 40-μl aliquots of the diluted gel were rotated separately for 3 h at 4 °C with 30 μg of the purified hsp90 truncated mutants equilibrated in binding buffer (500 μl) containing 0.2% Triton X-100. After pelleting by microcentrifugation, the gels were washed repeatedly as already described, boiled in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (40 μl), and then examined for protein retention by SDS-PAGE. To determine the binding preference of CyP40 for hsp90αversus hsp90β, the diluted glutathione-agarose gel containing GST-bCyP40 WT fusion protein was suspended in 500 μl of binding buffer plus 0.2% v/v Triton X-100, together with 30 μg of protein consisting of either purified hsp90 530–72"
https://openalex.org/W2061663235,"The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been implicated in the degradation of newly synthesized, misfolded and unassembled proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using a cell-free reticulocyte lysate system we have examined the relationship between biosynthesis and ER-associated degradation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a polytopic protein with 12 predicted transmembrane segments. Our results provide direct evidence that full-length, glycosylated and membrane-integrated CFTR is a substrate for degradation and that degradation involves polyubiquitination and cytosolic proteolytic activity. CFTR ubiquitination was both temperature- and ATP-dependent. Degradation was significantly inhibited by EDTA, apyrase, and the proteasome inhibitors hemin and MG132. Degradation was inhibited to a lesser extent by clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, ALLN, andN α-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and was relatively unaffected by lactacystin andN-tosyl lysyl chloromethyl ketone. In the presence of hemin, polyubiquitinated CFTR remained tightly associated with ER microsomes. However, membrane-bound ubiquitinated CFTR could be subsequently degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments upon incubation in hemin-free, ATP-containing lysate. Thus ER-associated degradation of CFTR occurs via a membrane-bound, rather than cytosolic, intermediate and likely involves recruitment of degradation machinery to the ER membrane. Our data suggest a model in which the degradation of polytopic proteins such as CFTR is coupled to retrograde translocation and removal of the polypeptide from the lipid bilayer.

The ER also functions to recognize misfolded or unassembled proteins and prevent their exit to the Golgi complex (5Bonifacino J. Klausner R. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A. Modern Cell Biology.

Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Substrates for ERAD, like other secretory and transmembrane proteins, are initially targeted to and translocated across the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon complex (1Rapoport T. Rolls M. Jungnickel B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Johnson A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 90-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, aberrantly folded proteins are selectively translocated back into the cytosol where they undergo ubiquitination and degradation by cytosolic proteases (9Plemper R. Boehmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Wiertz E. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T. Rapoport T. Ploegh H.

Brodsky J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant forms of carboxypeptidase Y and unassembled T cell receptor α subunits translocate back to the cytosol but remain associated with cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane (14Yu H.

Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). In both cases the generation of cytosolic intermediates is thought to occur via retrograde transport through the Sec61 translocon complex (9Plemper R. Boehmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Wiertz E. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T. Rapoport T. Ploegh H.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is also involved in the ER-associated degradation of polytopic proteins. Yeast mutants with defective ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes or proteasome subunits show decreased degradation of mutant forms of Sec61p (16Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 17Sommer T. Jentsch S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25590-25597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ERAD may also play a role in ensuring proper protein levels in the ER as suggested by mevalonate-mediated regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (19Roitelman J. Simoni R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25264-25273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Edwards P. Lan S. Tanaka R. Fogelman A. J. Biol.

For the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a plasma membrane protein, approximately 80% of wild type protein and 100% of common mutant forms are degraded prior to reaching the Golgi complex (22Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, 23Ward C. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that ER-associated degradation of CFTR also requires an intact ubiquitin conjugation pathway and likely involves the 26 S proteasome (24Ward C. Omura C. Kopito R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar, 25Jensen T. Loo M. Pind S. Williams D. Goldberg A. Riordan J. Cell. 1995; 83: 129-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). While the underlying reasons for CFTR degradation remain unknown, it has been proposed that the majority of wild type CFTR, like mutant CFTR, is recognized by ER quality control machinery, because it fails to fold properly (26Qu B. Strickland E. Thomas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15739-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Qu B. Thomas P. J. Biol.

Degradation of polytopic proteins by cytosolic proteases poses a particular problem in that multiple transmembrane (TM) segments must be removed from the membrane. It is unclear whether polytopic proteins, like secretory and bitopic transmembrane proteins, proceed through cytosolic intermediates prior to degradation. One possibility is that the proteasome might degrade only cytosolic peptide loops, leaving lumenal and/or transmembrane segments to be degraded by other proteases (7Sommer T. Wolf D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Lyko F. Martoglio B. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19873-19878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternatively, degradation might be coupled to the process of retrograde translocation. To distinguish among these possibilities, it will be necessary to define the temporal relationship between recognition, retrograde translocation, and degradation events involved in polytopic protein ER degradation. In this regard, a cell-free system that reconstitutes ERAD is attractive, because it is readily amenable to physical and pharmacological manipulation. Using such a system, Satoet al. (31Sato S. Ward C. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that CFTR could be ubiquitinated cotranslationally, indicating that initial recognition events in ER degradation might occur very early in the lifetime of a polytopic protein. In the current study we use a similar cell free system to demonstrate that CFTR ubiquitination can also occur after protein synthesis, N-linked glycosylation, and membrane integration have been completed. We have also been able to separate the process of ubiquitination from that of degradation and now show that ubiquitinated CFTR remains tightly associated with the ER membrane until it is degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments. CFTR degradation is therefore physically localized to the ER. Our results are consistent with a model in which cytosolic degradation machinery is recruited to the ER membrane by polyubiquitinated substrates and suggest that degradation occurs coincident with polypeptide removal from the lipid bilayer. ALLN, TPCK, TLCK, hemin, bovine ubiquitin, anti-bovine ubiquitin antibody, and 14C-methylated lysozyme were purchased from Sigma. The protease inhibitor mixture, (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, E-64, EDTA, and leupeptin), MG132, lactacystin, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were purchased from Calbiochem. Nucleotide triphosphates, creatine phosphate, creatine kinase, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Anti-CFTR antisera was raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 45–65 (N terminus), 680–700 (R domain), and 1458–1476 (C terminus) (BAbCo, Berkeley, CA). Other regents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate for translation was prepared from fresh rabbit reticulocytes induced by acetylphenylhydrazine treatment as described previously (32Jackson R. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Prior to freezing, hemin was added to a final concentration of 40 μm. For degradation experiments, RRL was either purchased from Green Hectare Farm (Oregon, WI) or prepared as described previously (32Jackson R. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) but without addition of hemin. Although degradation efficiency varied between different preparations of RRL, no consistent differences were observed between different RRL sources. To prepare ATP-depleted RRL, reticulocytes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium lacking glucose, and incubated in 0.2 mm 2,4-dinitrophenol and 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose at 37 °C for 90 min (33Ciechanover A. Hod Y. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 1100-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Reticulocytes were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by adding 1.5 volume of 1.0 mm DTT. Samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman JA17 rotor), and the supernatant (i.e. RRL) was stored at −80 °C. Methylated ubiquitin was prepared by reductive methylation as described previously (34Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Bovine ubiquitin was incubated at room temperature for 20 h in 12 mm formaldehyde and 20 mmcyanoborohydride followed by an additional hour in fresh reagents. The reaction was dialyzed for 48 h in 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm DTT and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a centricon (number 3) filter. CFTR mRNA was transcribed in vitro at 40 °C for 1 h in reactions containing 0.4 mg/ml plasmid DNA (plasmid pSPCFTR(35)), 40 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 6.0 mm MgAc2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, UTP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.5 mm GpppG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml bovine calf tRNA, 0.75 unit/ml RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.4 unit/ml SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Transcript was stored frozen at −80 °C. Translation was performed at 24–25 °C for 2 h in a reaction containing 20% transcription mixture, 40% nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 20% Emix, and a final concentration of 400 μg/ml creatine kinase, 0.1 mg/ml tRNA, 0.2 μl of RNAse inhibitor (Promega), 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT. Emix contains 5 mm ATP, 5 mm GTP, 60 mm creatine phosphate, 0.2 mm each of 19 essential amino acids, except methionine, and 5 μCi/μl of Tran35S-label (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine CA). Canine pancreas microsomal membranes, prepared as described elsewhere (36Walter P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), were added at the start of translation to a final concentration of A 280 8.0. For all experiments except those in Fig. 1 A, aurin tricarboxylic acid (0.1 mm) was added to the translation mixture after 15 min to synchronize translation and reduce synthesis of partial length chains. For membrane pelleting and floatation experiments puromycin HCl (final concentration 1 mm) was added at T = 110 min to ensure that nascent chains were released from ribosomes. Translation products were incubated in 0.1 m NaC03 (pH 11.5) or in 0.25 msucrose, 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.5) for 30 min on ice as described (37Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 30 min, and membrane pellets were dissolved directly in SDS loading buffer. Supernatants were precipitated in 20% trichloroacetic acid, pelleted at 16,000 × g for 15 min, washed with acetone, and dissolved in SDS loading buffer. RRL aliquots were diluted directly into 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (0.1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0)) and preincubated with antisera for 10–30 min prior to addition of 5 μl of protein A Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad). CFTR antisera and nonimmune antisera were used at 1:1000 dilution. Ubiquitin antibody was used at 1:200 dilution (similar amounts of Ig were present in all reactions). Samples were mixed at 4 °C for 6–10 h, washed three times with Buffer A, twice with 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.0), and taken up in SDS loading buffer. The translation mixture was layered onto a 0.5 m sucrose buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 10 min. Membranes were resuspended in ice-cold 0.1 m sucrose buffer (0.1 m sucrose, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) at one-half the original translation volume. The degradation reaction, assembled on ice, included 20% resuspended membranes, 72% reticulocyte lysate, and a final concentration of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 12 mm creatine phosphate, 3 mm DTT, and 80 μg/ml of creatine kinase. Where indicated, RRL was replaced with water, and proteasome inhibitors were added. For ATP-depleted RRL, ATP and creatine phosphate were omitted. The degradation mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were added directly to loading buffer for SDS-PAGE, EnHance (NEN Life Sceince Products) fluorography and autoradiography. Autoradiograms were scanned on an AGFA studioscan II transmission scanner using Adobe Photoshop software. Quantitation of autoradiograms was performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech DTS scanning densitometer precalibrated with a Kodak photographic step tablet (Eastman Kodak Co.). Trichloroacetic acid-soluble counts were quantitated by precipitating degradation mixture in 20% trichloroacetic acid, incubating on ice for 30 min, pelleting at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and counting supernatants in 10 volumes of Ready Safe scintillation fluid (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) in a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Microsomal membranes from translation mixture were pelleted, resuspended, and incubated in ATP- containing RRL in the presence of 40 μm hemin as described above. For pelleting experiments, aliquots of this RRL/hemin mixture were taken at specified time points; KCl or Triton X-100 was added as indicated; the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and pelleted through 0.5 m sucrose buffer as above. Equivalent fractions of pellet and supernatant (resuspended directly in SDS loading buffer) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For floatation experiments, aliquots of the RRL/hemin mixture were diluted into 10 volumes of 2.2m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, or into 2.2 m sucrose, 0.6 m KCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm EDTA. 100-μl samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and overlaid with 300 μl of 1.8 m sucrose, 0.1m KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm DTT and then overlaid with 200 μl of 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1 mKCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Solutions were centrifuged at 350,000 × g for 2 h in a TLA 100.2 rotor. 55-μl aliquots were taken from top to bottom, mixed with 180 μl of 0.1 m sucrose buffer, and samples were repelleted at 170,000 × g for 10 min prior to addition of SDS loading buffer and autoradiography. To examine the steps of CFTR degradation in native ER membranes, we first characterized expression of full-length CFTR protein in a cell-free RRL system. Translation of plasmid pSPCFTR (35Hasegawa H. Skach W. Baker O. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V. Verkman A. Science. 1992; 258: 1477-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) in the absence of ER-derived microsomal membranes generated a polypeptide migrating at ∼160 kDa (Fig.1 A). This translation product shifted 6 kDa in size when rough microsomes were added at the start of translation, consistent with the addition of two N-linked core carbohydrates at the predicted consensus sites in the fourth extracytoplasmic loop. The presence of full-length CFTR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with peptide-specific antisera raised against N terminus, R domain, and C terminus epitopes. Carbonate extraction of translation products demonstrated that in vitro synthesized CFTR was fully integrated into the ER membrane. Thus the RRL system is capable of efficiently reconstituting the early events of CFTR biosynthesis and processing, in agreement with results reported by Satoet al. (31Sato S. Ward C. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7189-7192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To test the stability of newly synthesized CFTR in the ER membrane, cyclohexamide was added after 2 h of translation, and samples were incubated for an additional 4 h (Fig. 1 B). At 24 °C, CFTR was remarkably stable, whereas at 37 °C CFTR was rapidly converted into a high molecular weight (HMW) complex with an estimated size of >450 kDa (T 12 <30 min). For convenience, this large complex will subsequently be referred to as the HMW complex, and the ∼170 kDa band will be referred to as full-length CFTR. To determine the requirements for conversion of CFTR into the HMW complex, CFTR was translated in RRL, and microsomal membranes were collected by pelleting through a sucrose cushion (Fig.2 A). Microsomes were then resuspended and incubated at 37 °C in sucrose buffer containing ATP (lanes 1–5), RRL supplemented with an ATP regeneration system (lanes 6–10), ATP-depleted RRL (lanes 11–15), or ATP-depleted RRL supplemented with additional ATP (lanes 15–20). At specified time points samples were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. In the presence of buffer alone, or in ATP-depleted RRL, >70% of full-length CFTR remained intact after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 2 B). However, when microsomal membranes were incubated in fresh RRL containing ATP, or in ATP-depleted RRL supplemented with additional ATP, full-length CFTR was rapidly converted into the HMW complex (T 12 < 30 min) that subsequently disappeared over the next 4 h. These results are consistent with a two-step process in which full-length CFTR is initially converted into a HMW complex via an ATP-dependent mechanism, and the HMW complex is then a substrate for degradation. We noted that degradation of the CFTR HMW complex in Fig. 2 contrasted with results in Fig. 1 B where the complex accumulated over time. One difference between these two experiments is that CFTR translation is performed in the presence of hemin, a required co-factor for protein expression in RRL (38Beuzard Y. Rodvien R. London I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and aurin tricarboxylic acid, an inhibitor of protein synthesis initiation. Both of these compounds inhibit ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated substrates in RRL. These results, together with the requirement for ATP and cytosol, suggested that the HMW complex might represent polyubiquitinated CFTR. Microsomal membranes containing newly synthesized CFTR were therefore incubated in fresh RRL supplemented with bovine ubiquitin and 40 μm hemin. Aliquots were then immunoprecipitated with anti-bovine ubiquitin antisera and analyzed by SDS-PAGE at specified time points. As shown in Fig.3 A, the HMW complex, but not full-length CFTR, was reactive against anti-ubiquitin antisera (lanes 11–15). No reactivity was observed when immunoprecipitation was performed with nonimmune sera (NIS,lanes 6–10) or when bovine ubiquitin was omitted from the lysate (data not shown). To further confirm CFTR ubiquitination, microsomes containing newly synthesized CFTR were incubated in RRL in the presence of methylated ubiquitin, which blocks the sequential addition of ubiquitin molecules by preventing isopeptide bond formation at ubiquitin residue Lys-48. Under these conditions we observed a dose-dependent inhibition in the rate of HMW complex formation (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the sequential, covalent addition of multiple ubiquitin molecules contributes to the formation of the CFTR HMW complex. We next examined the ability of protease inhibitors to influence the disappearance of the CFTR HMW complex. Inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases had essentially no effect on the rate of disappearance of either full-length CFTR or the HMW complex (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, hemin and MG132, both known inhibitors of the proteasome, resulted in significant delay in the disappearance of the HMW complex particularly at early time points (Fig. 4 B). Quantitation of autoradiograms revealed that hemin effectively blocked 60% of HMW complex degradation. In contrast, MG132, ALLN, and TPCK slowed but did not prevent HMW complex disappearance. Surprisingly, little inhibition was observed for lactacystin or TLCK. These results suggested either that certain proteasome inhibitors might be relatively inactive in the RRL system, or alternatively, that degradation of ubiquitinated CFTR might involve additional protease activities. To distinguish between these possibilities, we therefore examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the degradation of methylated lysozyme, a known substrate of the 26 S proteasome. For these and subsequent experiments the rate and extent of protein degradation was quantitated by measuring the conversion of CFTR and/or lysozyme into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments. As shown in Fig. 5, 26% of [14C]lysozyme and 65% of newly synthesized CFTR were degraded into trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide fragments within 3 h in RRL. Lysozyme degradation was inhibited by approximately 90% in the presence of 40 μm hemin or 10 mmEDTA consistent with previous studies (39Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2400-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hemin also resulted in formation of a HMW complex containing [14C]lysozyme (data not shown). In contrast, the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, as well as its active metabolite clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, had little effect on lysozyme degradation (<10% inhibition). Under these same conditions CFTR degradation was inhibited by approximately 80% in the presence of EDTA or the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme, apyrase. Hemin inhibited CFTR degradation by 56%, while lactacystin and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone inhibited CFTR degradation by only 20 and 35%, respectively. In these latter experiments, lactacystin-based inhibitors were preincubated with RRL for 30–60 min prior to addition of CFTR-containing microsomal membranes. These experiments demonstrate that specific lactacystin-based proteasome inhibitors are relatively inactive at blocking degradation of these ubiquitinated substrates in RRL. It should also be noted that a significant amount of CFTR degradation in RRL (35–40%) appears to proceed through a hemin insensitive pathway distinct from that utilized by lysozyme. Sixty-five percent of in vitro synthesized CFTR protein was degraded to trichloroacetic acid-soluble fragments within 3 h of incubation in RRL (Fig. 5). Degradation could not be restricted solely to large cytosolic peptide loops (i.e. N terminus, nucleotide binding domains, and the R-domain), as these loops contain only 47% of total methionine residues (40Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (5977) Google Scholar). Rather, our data indicate that proteolytic machinery also gains access to small cytosolic loops and possibly lumenal and/or transmembrane regions of the protein. Thus prior to or coincident with degradation, some or all of CFTR is likely to be extracted from the membrane. We therefore tested whether the ubiquitinated HMW complex, which has already been targeted for degradation by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, might undergo retrograde translocation to a cytosolic intermediate. Ubiquitinated CFTR complexes were generated by incubation in RRL (in the presence of hemin), and vesicles were collected by pelleting through a sucrose cushion. As shown in Fig.6 A, both CFTR and the CFTR HMW complex were nearly quantitatively recovered in the microsome pellet in the absence of detergent. In addition, preincubation of CFTR-containing microsomes in high salt (up to 1.1 m KCl) failed to extract full-l"

Two mammalian PLD forms, designated PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned, but their cellular localization and function are not fully understood. Here, we report that in HaCaT human keratinocytes, as well as other cell lines, PLD activity is highly enriched in low density, Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains that contain the caveolar marker protein caveolin-1. Similar to other PLDs, the PLD activity in these membrane domains is stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and is inhibited by neomycin. Immunoblot analysis indicated that caveolin-rich membrane domains do not contain the PLD1 isoform. Stable transfection of mouse PLD2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells greatly increased PLD activity in these domains compared with PLD activity in control Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with vector alone. PLD activity is enriched in low density Triton-insoluble membrane domains also in U937 promonocytes, even though these cells do not express caveolin-1. In U937 cells, also, PLD1 is largely excluded from low density Triton-insoluble membrane domains. Expression of recombinant caveolin-1 in v-Src-transformed NIH-3T3 cells resulted in up-regulation of PLD activity in the caveolin-containing membrane domains. The caveolin scaffolding peptide (caveolin-182–101) modulated the caveolar PLD activity, causing stimulation at concentration of 1–10 μm and inhibition at concentrations >10 μm. We conclude that a PLD activity, which is likely to represent PLD2, is enriched in low density Triton-insoluble membrane domains. The effects of caveolin-1 expression and of the caveolin scaffolding peptide suggest that in cells that express caveolin-1, PLD may be targeted to caveolae.

Although the activation of PLD isoforms is likely to be involved in signal transduction and membrane traffic events, their precise cellular localization and function(s) are still poorly defined. There is growing evidence for the existence in biological membranes of microdomains that are laterally segregated in the plane of the bilayer and that are enriched in sphingolipids and in cholesterol. Such microdomains have been variously termed detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-rich complexes (DIGs), glycosphingolipid-enriched membranes, and sphingolipid-cholesterol “rafts” (18Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). DIGs are related, in their lipid composition and their resistance to detergent solubilization, to specific morphologically and biochemically well defined cellular structures called caveolae (19Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated plasma membrane invaginations, 50–100 nm in size, that have a characteristic striated coat structure (20Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 1988; 90: 341-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major caveolar coat protein is caveolin, a 21-kDa integral membrane protein (21Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Caveolin forms high molecular weight homo-oligomers (22Song K.S. Tang Z. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). The lipid composition of caveolae and DIGs facilitates their isolation as low density, Triton-insoluble (LDTI) membrane particles on discontinuous sucrose density gradients (24Brown D. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar, 25Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Analyses of a large variety of cell types have indicated that DIGs are present in most, if not all, eukaryotic cells. In contrast, caveolae are found mostly (although not exclusively) in epithelial cells and generally are absent from hematopoietic cells (21Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Caveolae have been implicated in transport processes such as endocytosis and transcytosis (Ref. 26Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar and citations therein), as well as cholesterol efflux (27Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1503-1521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both caveolae and DIGs are thought to play an important role in cellular signal transduction (28Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.

We now report that a PLD activity is enriched in these membrane domains. We further show that this enzyme is not PLD1, and that recombinant PLD2 is preferentially targeted to LDTI membranes in stably transfected CHO cells. Finally, we demonstrate that the PLD activity in LDTI membranes is markedly up-regulated in cells that overexpress recombinant caveolin-1 and is modulated in vitro by the caveolin scaffolding domain peptide (caveolin-182–101).

CHO cells were grown in Alfa+ medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin). cDNA encoding mouse PLD2 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Frohman) was subcloned into a plasmid vector for stable transfection (pEGFPN3,CLONTECH) using NheI and SmaI restriction sites. Four μg of DNA were transfected per 35-mm, 70% confluent dish using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were selected with 600 μg/ml G418 in the culture medium and used after 2 months. Low density Triton X-100-insoluble membrane domains were purified from cultured cells essentially as described (25Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell monolayers (two confluent 150-mm dishes; ∼3 × 107 cells) were scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100. After homogenization, cell extracts were adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 1 ml of the above buffer (minus Triton X-100) containing 80% sucrose and placed at the bottom of an 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous gradient was formed above the lysate by adding 4 ml each of 30 and 5% sucrose solutions, and the tubes were centrifuged at 190,000 ×g (39,000 rpm) for 16–20 h in an SW-41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions (0.9 ml) were collected beginning at the top of the gradient. The pellet was resuspended in 0.9 ml of MES-NaCl buffer. The protein content of each fraction was determined according to a modified Lowry procedure using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). In experiments in which the distribution of total PLD activity was determined directly in aliquots of gradient fractions (Figs. 1 and 2), a Triton X-100 concentration of 0.5% was maintained along the entire gradient to ensure an equal detergent concentration and minimize surface-dilution effects on PLD activity. LDTI membrane domains of U937 cells were prepared as above with some minor modifications as described in Ref.42Parolini I. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. Peschle C. Blood. 1996; 87: 3783-3794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. For characterization of PLD activity (Tables I and II), the sucrose gradient fractions containing membrane domains were diluted 2-fold in 25 mm MES, 0.15 m NaCl buffer, and the membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was resuspended in MES-NaCl buffer and utilized in PLD assays or immunoblot analysis for caveolin-1 and PLD1.Figure 2Localization of phospholipase D activity in low density sucrose gradient fractions containing caveolin-1 prepared from NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts.

Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of MES-NaCl buffer and aliquots were assayed for PLD activity either in the absence or presence of 5 mm neomycin in the assay mixture. The activity of PLD was determined with 1-acyl-2-(6-N-(7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3 diazol-4-yl)amino)caproyl-phosphatidylcholine (C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine) (Avanti Polar Lipids) as substrate, measuring the production of C6-NBD-phosphatidylpropanol. The assay was carried out essentially as described before (43Danin M. Chalifa V. Möhn H. Schmidt U.S. Liscovitch M. Fain J.N. Lipid Metabolism in Signaling Systems. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 14-24Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, the reaction mixtures (120 μl) contained 50 mmNa-HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 mmC6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine, 150 mm 1-propanol, and 2–5 mol % PIP2 (Boehringer Mannheim). The amount of protein present in the assay varied when PLD was determined directly in aliquots of gradient fractions. In the PLD characterization experiments (Table I) protein concentration was 13 μg/ml. Reactions were carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. Termination and separation of the products by thin layer chromatography were carried out as described previously (43Danin M. Chalifa V. Möhn H. Schmidt U.S. Liscovitch M. Fain J.N. Lipid Metabolism in Signaling Systems. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 14-24Google Scholar). Results are expressed in terms of C6-NBD-phosphatidylpropanol fluorescence units produced. PLD activity was assayed in intact [3H]oleic acid-prelabeled cells by measuring production of the specific PLD product [3H]phosphatidylethanol according to a previously published procedure (44Liscovitch M. Amsterdam A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11762-11767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies were raised to a peptide sequence (CARMPWHDIASAVHGK) that corresponds to residues 675–688 of human PLD1, to which a Cys-Ala N-terminal extension was added to facilitate cross-linking to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Rabbits were immunized against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptide antigen by injection of 500 μg of the conjugate in complete Freund's adjuvant, and antibody production was boosted by four additional injections of the antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3-week intervals. This antiserum, designated anti-PLD1 (3074), interacts with a ∼120-kDa protein band in a number of human cell types, including HeLa, U937, and HT-29 cell lines, as well as human platelets. The interaction of anti-PLD1 (3074) with this band was competitively blocked by the peptide antigen, indicating that it binds to the same epitope on the ∼120-kDa protein band. In addition, the 3074 antiserum cross-reacted with recombinant human PLD1 expressed in COS-7 cells, indicating that it recognizes authentic human PLD1 (data not shown). Aliquots taken from each of the sucrose density gradient fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked by incubation for 1 h with 5% skim milk (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoblot analysis was carried out with a monoclonal antibody to caveolin-1 (clone 2297, Transduction Laboratories) or anti-PLD1 (3074), both utilized in a dilution of 1:1000 in the blocking buffer. Another anti-PLD1 serum (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was utilized according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blots were then washed extensively and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially available kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To obtain LDTI membrane domains, Triton X-100-based lysates were prepared from HaCaT human keratinocytes. Lysates were fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient. The fractions were analyzed for protein concentration, caveolin-1 immunoreactivity, and PLD activity. The distribution of protein along the gradient was highly skewed, with greater than 90% of the total protein present in the high density fractions, starting at fraction 9 (Fig.1 A, open circles). These fractions contain 40% sucrose and represent the combined cytosolic and Triton-soluble proteins. The last fraction represents the pellet and contains Triton-insoluble protein complexes, probably comprising nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins. In contrast, immunoblot analysis with a specific antibody to caveolin-1 indicated that low density fractions 5 and 6 contained nearly all of the cellular caveolin-1, a specific coat protein of caveolae (Fig. 1 A, inset). These data confirm previous results obtained in other cell types and indicate that LDTI membrane domains include caveolae. Samples of each gradient fraction were tested for PLD activity utilizing a fluorescent phospholipid, C6-NBD-phosphatidylcholine, as a substrate in an in vitro assay system that includes PIP2 as the sole exogenously added cofactor (36Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Danin M. Chalifa V. Möhn H. Schmidt U.S. Liscovitch M. Fain J.N. Lipid Metabolism in Signaling Systems. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 14-24Google Scholar). Significant levels of PLD activity (evinced by production of C6-NBD-phosphatidylpropanol) were observed in most gradient fractions (Fig. 1 A, shaded columns). However, there was a peak of PLD activity associated with the caveolin-rich membranes in fractions 4–7. Under these assay conditions, the activity present in these domains comprised 16% of the total cellular PLD activity. The highest specific PLD activity was present in fraction 5 (Fig.1 B). The specific activity of PLD in fraction 5 was 7.7-fold higher than the activity detected in high density gradient fractions (fractions 10–13). To confirm the generality of these findings, we examined the distribution of PLD activity in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (Fig. 2). Overall, the pattern of PLD activity distribution in this cell line was very similar to that observed in HaCaT cells. The peak of PLD activity associated with DIGs and caveolae in LDTI fractions comprised 16.1% of the total activity distributed along the gradient (Fig. 2 A), and the peak specific PLD activity was 5-fold higher that the activity present in the high density fractions (Fig. 2 B). Qualitatively similar results were obtained in other cell lines, including COS-7 cells and U937 promonocytes (see below), MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells, and HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma. 2G. Fiucci, M. Czarny, and Y. Lavie, unpublished observations. These data indicate that the presence of significant PLD activity in low density, Triton-insoluble and caveolin-rich membrane domains is a general phenomenon. Multiple PLD activities exhibiting different biochemical and enzymological properties have been reported (see Ref. 45Liscovitch M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar for review). A preliminary characterization of the PLD in LDTI membrane domains was carried out in order to assess its relationship to previously reported activities. The activity of PLD in the domains was linear with time of incubation for up to 90 min and was maximal at pH 7.5–8.0. Although substantial enzymatic activity could be observed in the absence of any added lipid or protein cofactor, the addition of PIP2stimulated enzyme activity 5–17-fold, depending on other assay conditions (Table I). Maximal activation of PLD was observed at PIP2 concentrations ≥1 mol %. Sodium oleate, added at a concentration previously determined to be optimally effective in stimulation of brain membrane PLD (60 mol %), abolished enzyme activity, indicating that this is not the oleate-activated PLD. The divalent cation chelators EGTA and EDTA did not inhibit PLD activity; rather, in the absence of PIP2, enzyme activity was increased, and addition of Ca2+ reduced it to the levels observed in the absence of any divalent cation chelator (Table I). These data indicate that PLD in LDTI domains is not stimulated by divalent cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, but is similar to other PLD activities in its sensitivity to the lipid cofactor PIP2. The PLD activity in LDTI membrane domains was high despite the absence of exogenously added protein cofactors such as the small G proteins RhoA and ADP-ribosylation factor, known to activate human PLD1 (7Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 46Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M.

Because guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate was not routinely included in the assay mixture, it is unlikely that endogenous RhoA or ADP-ribosylation factor was involved in supporting the high PLD activity in LDTI membrane domains under our in vitro assay conditions. Furthermore, addition of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (in the presence of MgATP) had no effect on PLD activity in either the absence or presence of PIP2 (Table I). The possibility that PLD is anchored to LDTI membrane domains via its cofactor PIP2 was examined by testing the effect of neomycin, a ligand of PIP2 that previously has been shown to inhibit PLD activity (36Liscovitch M.

https://openalex.org/W2072079878,"One of the characteristic features of the structure of the epithelial sodium channel family (ENaC) is the presence of two highly conserved cysteine-rich domains (CRD1 and CRD2) in the large extracellular loops of the proteins. We have studied the role of CRDs in the functional expression of rat αβγ ENaC subunits by systematically mutating cysteine residues (singly or in combinations) into either serine or alanine. In the Xenopusoocyte expression system, mutations of two cysteines in CRD1 of α, β, or γ ENaC subunits led to a temperature-dependent inactivation of the channel. In CRD1, one of the cysteines of the rat αENaC subunit (Cys158) is homologous to Cys133 of the corresponding human subunit causing, when mutated to tyrosine (C133Y), pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, a severe salt-loosing syndrome in neonates. In CRD2, mutation of two cysteines in α and β but not in the γ subunit also produced a temperature-dependent inactivation of the channel. The main features of the mutant cysteine channels are: (i) a decrease in cell surface expression of channel molecules that parallels the decrease in channel activity and (ii) a normal assembly or rate of degradation as assessed by nondenaturing co-immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled channel protein. These data indicate that the two cysteines in CRD1 and CRD2 are not a prerequisite for subunit assembly and/or intrinsic channel activity. We propose that they play an essential role in the efficient transport of assembled channels to the plasma membrane.

The specific tissue and species expression patterns of the channels allow us to classify them in four subfamilies: (i) α, β, and γ ENaC subunits, mainly expressed in epithelia; (ii) MDEG1, MDEG2, ASIC, and DRASIC genes, recently identified in the nervous system of mammals; (iii) FaNaCh involved in synaptic transmission in snail; (iv) MEC-4, MEC-10, DEG-1 (degenerins), and UNC 105 of the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode expressed in sensory neurons and muscles, respectively (1Horisberger J.D. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All proteins of this supergene family share a common membrane topology with two transmembrane domains, short intracellular N and C termini and a large extracellular loop (2Canessa C.M. Merillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An heterotetrameric structure has been recently proposed for ENaC (3Firsov D. Gautschi I.

Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8317-8322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that this gene family of cation channel is tetrameric, despite a study suggesting a nonameric architecture for ENaC (6Snyder P.M. Cheng C. Prince L.S. Rogers J.C. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Structure-function studies performed on ENaC subunits have indicated some specific functional roles of different domains of the proteins. Schild et al. (7Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), have demonstrated that a stretch of amino acids, preceding the second (M2) transmembrane domain (pre-M2 domain) of each of the three subunits contributes to the formation of channel pore and is a major site for amiloride binding. Schild et al. (8Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, mutations of the PY motif abolishes the feedback inhibition of ENaC by intracellular Na+, an important mechanism controlling Na+reabsorption (12Kellenberger S. Gautschi I. Rossier B.C. Schild L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In intact cells (i.e. Xenopusoocytes) phosphorylation studies have also demonstrated a possible role of the C termini, as the target sequences for hormone-stimulated protein kinases A- and C-dependent phosphorylation of the β and γ ENaC subunits (13Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The intracellular N terminus of the α subunit has been identified as a possible gating domain for ENaC (14Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: A0161Google Scholar). The same portion of the γ subunit protein has also been described as participating in ENaC subunit assembly (15Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27295-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Little information is, however, available about the structural and functional role of the extracellular loop of ENaC subunits. The extracellular loop represents the largest domain (∼70% of amino acids) and is glycosylated for most members of the family. The most notable feature of the extracellular loop is the presence of two cysteine-rich domains (CRD1 and CRD2) covering about 50% of the sequence. Among 15 αβγ ENaC subunits cloned from different species, all the extracellular cysteines (16Garcia-Anoveros J. Ma C. Chalfie M. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 441-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) are conserved, suggesting that they are involved in disulfide bond formation. Most of these cysteines (14Gruender S. Schild L. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: A0161Google Scholar) are also conserved among the genes expressed in mammalian nervous system (MDEG 1 and 2, ASIC, and DRASIC) as well as among the degenerins and FaNaCh. The degenerins family is characterized by the presence of an additional CRD (16Garcia-Anoveros J. Ma C. Chalfie M. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 441-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Considering the number, sequence distribution, and potential disulfide bond formation, one could suggest an important role(s) of these cysteines in formation of mature ENaC/DEG channels. A particular interest into the CRDs arose from the recently identified Cys133 to Tyr133 mutation in the CRD1 of human αENaC subunit causing the pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA-1), an inherited disease characterized by severe neonatal salt wasting, hyperkaliaemia, metabolic acidosis, and unresponsiveness to the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone (17Gruender S. Chang S.S. Lifton R. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: S069Google Scholar). In studies of the mechanism of this mutation we have demonstrated that αC133Y replacement leads to the temperature-sensitive decrease in functional activity of ENaC, usually suggesting an impaired folding and/or assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment, as shown, for example, for the CFTRΔF508 mutant (18Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). To study the functional role(s) of CRD1 and CRD2 of ENaC, we replaced the conserved cysteine residues with either serine or alanine. Functional and cell surface expression of the mutants show that replacement of two cysteines from the CRD1 of α, β, and γ ENaC subunits and two cysteines from the CRD2 of the α and β but not the γ subunit prevents the normal transport of assembled channels from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane, thereby decreasing the number of ENaC molecules at the cell surface. Cysteine to serine or alanine mutations were introduced into the rat α, β, and γ ENaC cDNAs by the polymerase chain reaction-based approach. The relative positions of the conserved cysteines along the extracellular loops of α, β, and γ subunits are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows also an abbreviated numbering of the mutated cysteines used in this study to simplify the presentation of the data. The corresponding mutations are: αC1S is αC158S; αC2S is αC256S; αC3S is αC263S; αC4S is αC309S; αC5S is αC316S; αC6S is αC332S; αC7S is αC421S; αC8S is αC443S; αC9S is αC447S; αC10S is αC456S; αC11S is αC458S; αC12S is αC472S; αC13S is αC483S; αC14S is αC498S; αC15S is αC502S; αC16S is αC506S; βC1S is βC98S; βC6S is βC270S; βC11S is βC399S; βC12S is βC413S; γC1S is γC100S; γC6S is γC284S; γC11S is γC410S; γC12S is γC424A. The γC424 has been mutated to an alanine to avoid the formation of a consensus sequence forN-linked glycosylation. The rat αC158 (αC1) residue corresponds to the human αC133 described as causing the PHA-1 phenotype when mutated to Tyr (αC133Y). All the β and γ subunit mutations were introduced into the FLAG epitope-tagged β and γ cDNAs, allowing determination of the cell-surface expressing ENaC using a binding analysis (see below). All mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method on both strands. Complementary RNAs of each αβγ ENaC subunits and the corresponding mutants were synthesized in vitro, and equal amounts of wild type (wt) or mutated subunit cRNA at saturating concentrations for maximal channel expression (9 ng of total cRNA) were injected into Xenopusoocytes. Macroscopic whole oocyte Na+ currents (INa) resulting from ENaC expression were measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique and determined as the amiloride-sensitive inward current at −100 mV holding potential. For both macroscopic current as well as binding analysis, the oocytes were kept after injection into the low Na+ modified Barth saline (MBS: 10 mm NaCl, 90 mm NMDG-Cl, 5 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm CaNO3, 0.82 mmMgSO4). Under standard conditions, the incubation temperature is kept at 19 °C. However, in our recent study of human αENaC C133Y mutation, this temperature has been demonstrated to be permissive for the functional expression of the mutant channel proteins that normally would not be expressed at the cell membrane when the incubation temperature was raised to 30 °C (17Gruender S. Chang S.S. Lifton R. Rossier B.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: S069Google Scholar). To test for the temperature dependence of the cysteine mutants activity into the rat sequence, we took advantage of the rapid expression of ENaC in the Xenopus oocytes system, in which significant channel activity is expressed as soon as 6–8 h after cRNA injection. Under standard physiological temperature (19 °C), the INa of wt αβγ ENaC was typically between 10 and 15 μA/oocyte. Preliminary experiments showed that the amiloride-sensitive sodium transport was temperature-dependent and increased by 50–80% when the temperature bath was raised to 30 °C, a maximum for a cell from a poikilotherm animal. Temperature sensitivity was therefore tested by comparing functional expression of wt and mutated channel protein at 19versus 30 °C. The cell surface expression of ENaC was determined by specific binding of [125I]M2IgG1 (M2Ab) to oocytes expressing FLAG-tagged β and γ subunits as described previously (19Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was iodinated using the IODO-BEADS Iodination reagent (Pierce) and carrier-free Na125I (Amersham), according to the Pierce protocol. Iodinated antibody had a specific activity of 5–20 × 1017 cpm/mol. Binding of the iodinated antibody to oocytes expressing the FLAG-containing wild-type or mutant β and γ ENaC subunits was determined 16–20 h after the cRNA injection. Twelve oocytes in each experimental group were transferred into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube containing the low sodium MBS supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and incubated for 30 min on ice. The binding was started by the addition of 12 nm of the iodinated antibody in a final volume of 100 μl. After 1 h incubation on ice, the oocytes were washed eight times with 1 ml of low sodium MBS supplemented with 5% calf serum and then transferred individually into tubes containing 250 μl of low sodium MBS. The samples were counted and the same oocytes utilized for two-electrode voltage-clamp studies. Nonspecific binding was determined on oocytes injected with untagged ENaC subunits. Injected with wild-type or mutant ENaC subunit oocytes were incubated in modified Bart's medium containing 0.8 mCi/ml [35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) for the times indicated in the figure legends and then subjected to different chase periods in the presence of 10 mm cold methionine. Microsomes were prepared as described (20Geering K. Girardet M. Bron C. Kraehenbuehl J.-P. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10338-10343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the immunoprecipitations were performed as described (21Geering K. Meyer D.I. Paccolat M.P. Kraehenbuehl J.-P. Rossier B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5154-5160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) under nondenaturing conditions, resolved by 5–8% gradient SDS-PAGE and revealed by fluorography. The polyclonal antibodies used were raised against the amino acids: 10 to 77 of the rat αENaC subunit, 559 to 636 of the rat βENaC subunit, and 570 to 650 of the rat γENaC subunit (2Canessa C.M. Merillat A.-M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1994; 267: C1682-C1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The wild-type (wt) or αENaC mutated subunits were expressed with wt FLAG-tagged β and γ subunits inXenopus oocytes to test for channel functional activity as well as for cell-surface expression at 19 °C. As shown in Fig.2, several cysteine mutants behave differently, both with respect to channel activity and to cell surface expression. In the CRD1, the mutations αC1S and αC6S are characterized by a low macroscopic Na+ current (INa) (Fig. 2 A), as well as a decrease in cell surface expression (Fig. 2 B). For these mutants, INa decreased significantly (35 ± 5%,n = 46, p < 0.001 and 25 ± 4%,n = 38, p < 0.001 of wt channel activity, respectively). Binding analysis showed a corresponding decrease in cell surface expression (21 ± 5%, n= 39, p < 0.001 and 20 ± 10%, n= 32, p < 0.001 of wt channel cell surface expression, respectively). Mutants of other cysteines from the CRD1 (αC2S to αC5S) were indistinguishable from wild type channels (Fig. 2,A and B). In the CRD2, two of the mutants (αC11S and αC12S) showed a significant decrease of INa at 19 °C (16.2 ± 3.7%, n = 27, p < 0.001 and 14.5 ± 2.6%, n = 27, p < 0.001, of wt channel activity, respectively) (Fig. 2 D). For these mutants, a parallel decrease in cell surface expression was observed (20.5 ± 4.8%, n = 27, p < 0.001 (αC11S) and 17.1 ± 4.1% n = 27,p < 0.001 (αC12S) of wt channel cell surface expression) (Fig. 2 E). In contrast, the other mutants (αC7S, αC8S, αC10S, αC13S, αC15S, and αC16S) showed a significant increase in INa with the greatest effect for the αC7S and αC16S mutants (304 ± 27%, n = 27, p < 0.001 and 329 ± 29%, n= 29, p < 0.001, of wt channel activity, respectively) (Fig. 2 D). However, the binding analysis did not reveal any significant changes in their cell surface expression (Fig.2 E). Using the assay described under “Experimental Procedures,” we tested the temperature sensitivity of wt and mutant channels at 30 °C versus 19 °C. At 30 °C all mutants in CRD1 (excepting αC4S) showed a significant decrease in INa (Fig.3 A). The activity (INa) of αC1S and αC6S mutants further decreased to near undetectable levels (5 ± 1% and 2.0 ± 0.5% of wt channel activity, respectively). In CRD2, no significant activity could be detected for the αC11S mutant (0.4 ± 0.1%,n = 16, p < 0.001) and αC12S mutant (0.2 ± 0.1%, n = 15, p < 0.001), respectively, of wt channel activity. For the other CRD2 mutants, a significant decrease in activity as compared with the 19 °C incubation condition was observed (Fig. 3 B). Only the αC7S mutant maintained a significant increase in channel activity (201 ± 27%, n = 15, p < 0.005) at 30 °C compared with the wt channel. In Fig. 2, C and F, the amiloride-sensitive sodium current (INa)/cell surface expression (fmol) ratios are shown. If a mutation decreases INa without changing the current/binding ratio, one can deduce that channel delivery to the cell surface has been impeded with no change in its intrinsic activity. Such was the case for αC1S and αC6S in CRD1 (Fig. 2 C) and αC11S and αC12S in CRD2 (Fig. 2 F). If a mutation increases the current/binding ratio, one can deduce that the intrinsic channel activity has increased. An example of this situation is the αC7S mutant (98.0 ± 14.3 μA/fmol, n = 27, p < 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, αC8S (61.9 ± 8.5 μA/fmol,n = 29, p < 0.001), αC13S (44.2 ± 6.1 μA/fmol, n = 27, p < 0.001), αC15S (50.5 ± 9.5 μA/fmol, n = 29,p < 0.005), and αC16S (69.9 ± 5.3 μA/fmol,n = 29, p < 0.001), compared with wt channel current/binding ratio (22.5 ± 2.0 μA/fmol,n = 30) (Fig. 2 F). Changes in several biophysical properties of the channel (ion conductance, gating, ion selectivity) could account for the differences in intrinsic channel activity (see discussion in Ref. 22Gruender S. Firsov D. Chang S.S. Jaeger N.F. Gautschi I. Schild L. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 899-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In our experimental conditions, it could be either the channel unitary conductance (gNa) or the mean open probability (P o). In addition, alteration of affinity to amiloride could influence the correct determination of INa in loss of function mutations. To distinguish between these possibilities, we measured the apparent inhibitory constant for amiloride (K i) and the unitary conductance for the αC1S, αC6S, αC11S, and αC12S as well as for the αC7S mutant. These experiments showed that neither K i to amiloride nor unitary conductance were affected by these mutations (data not shown). In addition, measurements of ion selectivity did not reveal any differences between wt and mutated channels. The order of ion permeability (Li+ > Na+ ≫≫ K+), characteristic of ENaC, was respected (data not shown). Interestingly, administration of two MTS (methanethiosulfonate) derivatives, MTSEA (2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate) and bulky pyrene-7-MTS (2-[(3-pyrenylpropyl)carboxamido]ethyl methanethiosulfonate) does not demonstrate a differential sensitivity to these agents of wt and mutant channels. The affinity to amiloride is not changed and the INa have an inhibition rate (∼20% with MTSEA and ∼60% with pyrene-7-MTS) similar for the wild type and all the 16 αENaC mutants (data not shown). These experiments suggest that in the three-dimensional structure of ENaC, positions of the cysteines are distant enough from the channel pore and amino acids determining the binding of amiloride. Finally, the studies of activity decreasing mutants indicate that the delivery of the αC1S, αC6S, αC11S, and αC12S containing channels to the plasma membrane is severely impeded at 19 °C and even more at 30 °C. In contrast, incubation at 30 °C abolishes (αC8S, αC10S, αC13S, αC15S, and αC16S) or decreases (αC7S) the increased activity of these mutants. We have therefore focused our studies on the mutants where the functional effects of the mutations were more pronounced with increased temperature. Various double mutants (αC1/C6S, αC6/C11S, αC11/C12S, αC1/C11S, αC1/C12S, αC6/C12S) were constructed in order to verify whether these mutations affect the same functional domain of the channel (CRD1 or CRD2) or not. Additivity of the functional effect should indicate that the two cysteines are in two distinct functional domains. Fig.4 shows that this was not the case for the αC1/C6S and αC11/C12S double mutants. Within CRD1 the double mutant αC1S/C6S is not functionally different from the single αC1S and αC6S mutants. Within CRD2, the double mutant αC11S/C12S was not additive but rather more active than the αC11S and αC12S mutants alone (Fig. 4). In contrast, the double mutations across CRD1 and CRD2 (αC1S/C11S, αC1S/C12S, αC6S/C11S, and αC6S/C12S) show strong additivity and are no longer functional (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the Cys1 and Cys6 in CRD1 on the one hand and the Cys11 and Cys12 in CRD2 on the other hand participate in the formation of two different functional domains of the αENaC subunit. Inactivation of both leads to complete loss of channel activity. The conservation of the extracellular cysteines among all the members of ENaC/DEG family suggests the potential importance of the corresponding cysteine residues in the function of β and γ ENaC subunits. To verify this hypothesis, we mutated the cysteines in the β and γ ENaC subunits corresponding to the αENaC Cys1, Cys6, Cys11, and Cys12 to either serine or alanine and then expressed them in Xenopus oocytes. The nonpermissive incubation temperature of 30 °C was chosen in order to maximize the functional effects. Fig.5 A demonstrates that the βC1S and βC6S mutations cause similar effects compared with the αC1S and αC6S mutants. The γC1S and γC6S mutations provoked an even more dramatic decrease in channel activity with almost no detectable INa. The oocytes injected with triple αC1S/βC1S/γC1S and αC6S/βC6S/γC6S mutant subunits have no detectable INa. These data indicate a similar functional role for Cys1 and Cys6 in each of the three ENaC subunits in CRD1. In CRD2, mutation of the Cys11 and Cys12 in the β and γ subunits revealed a different pattern of expression. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the effect of the double βC11S/C12S mutant is similar to that of the αC11S/C12S mutant. In contrast, the double γC11S/C12A mutant did not significantly alter the functional activity. Under nonpermissive condition (30 °C, 8 h of incubation) the activity of αβ, αβC11S/C12S, αγ, αγC11S/C12S channels was undetectable (Fig. 5 B). Mutation of the Cys11 and Cys12 in all three αβγ ENaC subunits led to unfunctional channels. These data suggest an asymmetric role of cysteines 11 and 12 in the α, β, and γ subunits. The absence of any detectable INa even after 76 h of expression of the triple αC1S-C6S/βC1S-C6S/γC1S-C6S and αC11S-C12S/βC11S-C12S/γC11S-C12A mutants (Fig. 5 C) also shows that the cause of the impaired cell surface expression is not due to a slow kinetic of intracellular transport but rather to a complete blockade of routing to the cell surface. The possible mechanisms which could explain the decreased cell surface expression of the cysteine mutants are the following: (i) misfolding during translation, (ii) lack of proper oligomerization due to abnormal conformations of assembled complexes, (iii) disruption of the normal transport of the mutant proteins from ER to Golgi and/or from Golgi to the cell surface, or (iv) increased rate of degradation of the mutant proteins leading to a decrease of the total channel protein pool. To test the hypothesis that misfolding by inability to form disulfide bridges leads to the disruption of proper assembly and oligomerization in the ER compartment (i and ii), we used a nondenaturing co-immunoprecipitation test as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oocytes were [35S]methionine metabolically labeled at 30 °C for 8 h. Under this experimental condition, oocytes expressing αC1S-C6S/βC1S-C6S/γC1S-C6S and αC11S-C12S/βC11S-C12S/γC11S-C12A subunits have no detectable INa (data not shown). As shown in Fig.6, the co-immunoprecipitation performed with α, β, or γ antibodies showed that the αC1S-C6S/βC1S-C6S/γC1S-C6S and αC11S-C12S/βC11S-C12S/γC11S-C12A mutants assembled as well as that of αβγ wild-type subunits. To test the degradation hypothesis (iv), pulse-chase experiments were performed at 19 °C in the oocytes injected either with wt αβγ subunits or with αC1S-C6S/βC1S-C6S/γC1S-C6S and αC11S-C12S/βC11S-C12S/γC11S-C12A mutant subunits. Similar half-lives (9–11 h) were observed for both wt and mutant ENaC subunits (Fig. 7). These results indicate that neither subunit assembly nor the rate of degradation have been grossly affected by the cysteine mutations.Figure 7The similar rate of degradation of wild-type and mutant ENaC subunits. Oocytes injected with 3 ng of either wild-type or three αC1S/C6S, βC1S/C6S, γC1S/C6S double mutants or three αC11S/C12S, βC11S/C12S, γC11S/C12A double mutants were labeled for 16 h with [35S]methionine and subjected to the indicated chase periods. Digitonin extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions with an anti-α polyclonal antibody. Fluorogram of 5–8% gradient SDS-PAGE of one of the three similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One of the distinct features of the ENaC/DEG gene family is its membrane topology which predicts that more than 70% of the protein mass is exposed to the extracellular space which is facing the external compartment of the organism (urine in the distal nephron and feces in the colon or airspace in the lung). This suggests that the extracellular loop has a possible role in specific protein-protein interaction (i.e with extracellular matrix proteins in the case of degenerins (23Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)) and/or ligand-receptor interaction. The extracellular loop of ENaC/DEG channel family proteins is characterized by the presence of two or three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs). It has been demonstrated that during protein folding and maturation, extracellular cysteine residues are rapidly oxidized, and that enzyme-catalyzed disulfide exchange continues until the most thermodynamically stable conformation is reached. Among the transport proteins, the formation of disulfide bonds in the extracellular loop or N and C terminus of the protein is usually critical for proper co-translational folding of the protein and subsequent assembly and oligomerization in the ER compartment. For instance, mutation of conserved cysteines forming disulfide bonds in the ectodomain of the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase prevents assembly with the α subunit without changing the half-life of the β protein (24Beggah A.T. Jaunin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10318-10326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Likewise, cysteine bonds in the ectodomain of the low density lipoprotein receptor allow the folding of this protein domain (repeated many times) into an octahedral cage, binding of calcium molecules, required for apoE and apoB binding and receptor recycling (25Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Mutations of one or two cysteines"

Homopolymeric primer/templates of defined length were used to evaluate the contribution of primer and template length and sequence to the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation without the complication of RNA structure.

Surprisingly, products greater than unit length formed in all reactions regardless of length or sequence. Neither a distributive nor a processive slippage mechanism could be used to explain completely the formation of long products. Rather, the data were consistent with a template-switching mechanism. All of the nucleotide could be polymerized during the course of the reaction. However, very few primers could be extended, suggesting an inverse correlation between the efficiency of primer utilization and that of nucleotide incorporation.

Positive-strand RNA viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans ranging from the common cold (1Couch R.B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 713-734Google Scholar) to chronic hepatitis (2Houghton M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 1035-1058Google Scholar). Critical to the replication of the genomes of these viruses is the virus-encoded, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) 1The abbreviations used are: RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide(s). 1The abbreviations used are: RdRP, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; nt, nucleotide(s).(3Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As this enzymatic activity is unique to virus-infected cells, the viral RdRP represents a very attractive target for the design of antiviral agents to treat RNA virus infection. Most positive-strand RNA viruses are thought to have the same general replication strategy, and this belief is generally extended to include the mechanism of genome replication (3Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RdRPs from many viruses have been characterized to some extent (3Buck K.W. Adv.

However, in no instance is detailed, mechanistic information available. This fact is even true for viruses, such as poliovirus, for which genetic and biochemical systems to study genome replication have existed for many years (10Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, poliovirus is one of the best understood systems with respect to the biochemistry of genome replication and is, therefore, an invaluable paradigm for all positive-strand RNA viruses (10Rueckert R.R. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 609-654Google Scholar). Replication of poliovirus genome initiates within the poly(A)-tract at the 3′-end of genomic RNA from a complex comprising viral factors (3AB, 3CD, 3B, and 3Dpol) (11Xiang W. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. Semin. Virol. 1997; 8: 256-273Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Harris K.S. Xiang W. Alexander L. Lane W.S. Paul A.V. Wimmer E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5988-5998Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3AB and 3CD are required primarily to establish an initiation complex, possibly by recruiting the polymerase, 3Dpol (13Andino R. Rieckhof G.E. Achacoso P.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). 3AB is a RNA-binding protein capable of interacting with 3Dpol (15,16) that possibly stimulates the rate of elongation of nascent RNA (17Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or enhances the efficiency of primer utilization (18Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12832-12840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA synthesis is catalyzed by 3Dpol, which initiates RNA synthesis from the protein primer, 3B. 3B is most often referred to as VPg. The recent solution of the crystal structure of poliovirus RdRP by the Schultz laboratory has catapulted this enzyme, in terms of structure, to the level of the other classes of nucleic acid polymerase (19Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Thus, a more precise understanding of the structure-function relationships of this enzyme is now possible. To be sure, an understanding of the elementary steps employed by polymerases in catalyzing nucleotide incorporation is essential in order to evaluate accurately the effects of mutations. Unfortunately, the prevailing absence of detailed, mechanistic information for 3Dpolgreatly limits the extent to which the structural information can be exploited. This is due, primarily, to the inability to establish stoichiometric complexes between 3Dpol, primer/template, and nucleotide. In this report, we have performed a systematic, quantitative analysis of the kinetics of 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation using homopolymeric substrates of defined length. These studies provide insight into the properties of primer/template required for the assembly of stoichiometric complexes between 3Dpol and primer/template. This information should prove useful in the design of heteropolymeric primer/templates to elaborate a detailed kinetic mechanism for this enzyme and, perhaps, other RdRPs. In addition, these studies revealed the unexpected ability of poliovirus 3Dpolalone to undergo template switching in vitro.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 h. 3Dpol was purified to greater than 95% purity by using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and phosphocellulose (Whatman), S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatographies as described previously (5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol.

The protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a reference. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE. Gels consisted of: 18% acrylamide, 2% bisacrylamide, 7 murea, and 1× TBE (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). The oligonucleotide ladder was visualized by UV shadowing. A gel slice containing only the full-length oligonucleotide was removed, and the nucleic acid was electroeluted from the gel in 1× TBE by using an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). Oligonucleotides were desalted on Sep-Pak columns (Millipore) as specified by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotides were typically suspended in TE (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. Concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm by using calculated extinction coefficients (21Carroll S.S. Benseler F. Olsen D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). [α-32P]NTPs were diluted to 0.1 μCi/μl in distilled, deionized H2O, and 1 μl was spotted in triplicate onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plates (EM Science). TLC plates were developed in 0.3 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen. Imaging and quantitation were performed by using the ImageQuant software from Molecular Dynamics. The purity was used to correct the specific activity of NTP in reactions in order to calculate accurate concentrations of product. Purity was checked before or after each experiment and ranged from 50% to 90%. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase essentially as specified by the manufacturer. Reactions typically contained 11 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 10 μm DNA or RNA oligonucleotide, and 0.4 units/μl T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by passing the sample over two consecutive 1-ml Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) spun columns. Labeling of the DNA ladder was performed by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase as specified by Life Technologies, Inc. Reactions contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 μCi/μl [α-32P]NTP, 500 μm NTP, primer/template, and 3Dpol. Reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Specific concentrations of primer/template and 3Dpol, along with any deviations from the above, are indicated in the appropriate figure legend. 10 μl of the quenched reaction was spotted onto DE81 filter paper discs and dried completely. The discs were washed three times for 10 min in 250 ml of 5% dibasic sodium phosphate and rinsed in absolute ethanol. Bound radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting in 5 ml of Ecoscint scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics). 10 μl of the quenched reaction mixture was added to an equal volume of loading buffer (80% formamide, 100 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris borate, 0.15% bromphenol blue, and 0.15% xylene cyanol) and heated to 70 °C for 1 min prior to loading 5 μl on a 1× TBE polyacrylamide gel of the appropriate percentage. Electrophoresis was performed in 1× TBE at 30 mA. Gels were visualized and quantitated by using a PhosphorImager. The ability to identify the individual steps employed by 3Dpol during a single cycle of nucleotide incorporation requires the assembly of stoichiometric complexes between 3Dpol and substrates: primer/template and nucleotide. Formation of such complexes with DNA-dependent DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases is an ordered process with primer/template binding prior to nucleotide (22Benkovic S.J. Cameron C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10984-10994Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition, stability of the initial binary complex depends on the length of primer/template, and rate of nucleotide incorporation depends on sequence (22Benkovic S.J. Cameron C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate rapidly the effect of primer and template length and sequence composition on the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by 3Dpol, without the complication of nucleic acid structure, we have used combinations of a variety of homopolymeric oligonucleotides and polynucleotides of defined length as primer/template substrates for 3Dpol. In the first series of experiments, poly(rA) was used as template and DNA oligonucleotides ranging in size from 6 to 20 nt were used as primers (Fig. 1 A). As reported previously, de novo synthesis is not observed on poly(rA) (27Flanegan J.B. Van Dyke T.A. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation was observed with oligo(dT) primers 6 nt or longer (Fig. 1 A). In addition, a primer length of 15–20 nt was optimal for most efficient nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 1 A). By using a 15- or 20-nt oligo(dT) primer, the amount of product formed was increased 5–25-fold relative to that observed with either a 6- or 10-nt primer. This apparent effect of primer length on 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation was not due to changes in the fraction of template coated by primer as this ratio was constant. In each case, a primer concentration sufficient to coat 30% of the template was used. It is worth noting, however, that maximal rates of nucleotide incorporation were observed only when a primer concentration sufficient to coat 30–100% of the template was used (Fig.2).Figure 2An optimal primer:template ratio exists for maximal rates of 3Dpol-catalyzed nucleotide incorporation. Reactions contained 3Dpol (0.5 μm), poly(rA) (60 μm AMP), UTP (20 μm), and dT15 (0–20 μm). Reactions were initiated by addition of 3Dpol and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The different symbols represent two individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When a similar series of experiments was performed using poly(rC) as template, de novo synthesis was observed, albeit at a 5–10-fold lower efficiency relative to that observed in the presence of a primer (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to oligo(dT)-primed poly(rU) synthesis, a 6-nt oligo(dG) primer was optimal for most efficient poly(rG) synthesis (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, a 2-fold decrease in the amount of nucleotide incorporated was noted as the length of the primer was increased to 10 nt (Fig. 1 B). The level of nucleotide incorporation was essentially the same for oligo(dG) primers 10, 15, or 20 nt in length (Fig. 1B). Experiments were also performed using 15-nt oligo(rU) and oligo(rG) primers. No significant difference in activity was observed with these RNA primers relative to the corresponding 15-nt DNA primers (data not shown). In order to assess more directly the effects of primer and template length on the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation, steady-state kinetic analysis was performed on the following primer/templates: dT15/rA400, dT15/rA30, dT15/rA16, and dT10/rA16; the data are presented in TableI. The K m values varied from 24.6 μm (dT15/rA30) to 122 μm (dT10/rA16), and theV max values varied from 1.1 μm/min (dT15/rA16) to 13.1 μm/min (dT15/rA400). Although no change in theK m for primer/template was observed when the length of the template was changed from 400 to 16 nt, a 3–5-fold increase in the K m was observed by changing the primer length from 15 to 10 nt. Interestingly, even under conditions of saturating substrates, the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation varied from substrate to substrate (Fig. 3). Both the duration of linearity and the reaction end points differed substantially when the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation into dT15/rA16 (Fig. 3 A) was compared with that into dT15/rA30 (Fig. 3 B) or dG15/rC30 (Fig. 3 C). TheK m of 3Dpol for dG15/rC30 is in the 15 μm range (data not shown). Therefore, in order to ensure accurate measurement of reaction rates as a function of substrate or enzyme concentration, reaction rates were determined from the linear phase of complete time courses.Table ISteady-state kinetic analysis of dTn/rAnprimer/templatesPrimer/templateK MV maxμmμm/mindT15/rA40045.3 ± 10.413.1 ± 1.5dT15/rA3024.6 ± 2.89.1 ± 0.5dT10/rA16122 ± 444.8 ± 0.9dT15/rA1638.2 ± 8.51.1 ± 0.1Time courses of nucleotide incorporation in reactions containing 3Dpol (0.5 μm) and dTn/rAn(1–200 μm) were obtained. The reaction rate at each primer/template concentration was determined by linear regression and plotted as a function of primer/template concentration. The data were fit to a hyperbola to obtain values for K M andV max. Open table in a new tab Time courses of nucleotide incorporation in reactions containing 3Dpol (0.5 μm) and dTn/rAn(1–200 μm) were obtained. The reaction rate at each primer/template concentration was determined by linear regression and plotted as a function of primer/template concentration. The data were fit to a hyperbola to obtain values for K M andV max. When the dependence of the reaction rate on enzyme concentration was measured using the linear phase of complete time courses, no evidence was obtained to support the hypothesis that oligomerization of 3Dpol is necessary for activity as suggested by Pataet al. (28Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows the linear phase of time courses for reactions under conditions of saturating substrates using concentrations of 3Dpol ranging from 0.5 μm to 2.0 μm. A plot of reaction rates, obtained by linear regression of the data shown in Fig. 4 A, as a function of 3Dpol concentration showed a linear relationship. Therefore, the cooperative transition in the 0.5–2.0 μm range observed by Pata et al. (28Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar) may be a reflection of the “snap-back” RNA substrate employed in that study. Finally, the dependence of the rate of nucleotide incorporation on 3Dpol concentration was also linear in the 0.05–5 μm range (data not shown). It has been reported by several investigators studying the oligo(dT)-primed, poly(rU)-polymerase activity of 3Dpol that this enzyme extends, at best, 0.1–1% of primers in reactions which typically contain a concentration of primer in the 1 μm range (28Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477PubMed Google Scholar,29Lubinski J.M. Ransone L.J. Dasgupta A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a low fraction of primer utilization is not surprising, however, given a K m of 3Dpol for dT15/rA400 of 45 μm. Therefore, it was comforting to note that the concentration of UMP incorporated was almost stoichiometric with respect to primer under saturating conditions of dT15/rA16 (Fig. 3 A). This suggested that in this reaction a greater fraction of primers were utilized. However, when products of reactions employing an end-labeled, (dT)15 primer were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging, extended primer was not observed (data not shown). In order to increase the limit of detection, products of reactions employing [α-32P]UTP were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging. Surprisingly, products ranging in length from 16 to 300 nt were apparent (data not shown). In order to verify that the origin of the long products was not contaminating nucleic acid, an experiment was performed in which 2 μm3Dpol, 122 μmdT15/rA16, and 0.5 μm[α-32P]UTP were incubated at 37 °C for 30, 60, or 90 s and then either quenched by the addition of EDTA or chased by the addition of 1000-fold molar excess of UTP and quenched after 10 min. Products were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized by phosphorimaging (Fig. 5). The pulse-quench experiment showed that the only products formed were those consistent with utilization of the 15-nt oligo(dT) primer. Moreover, the products labeled in the pulse were chased into the longer products (Fig. 5). The ability to form products greater than unit length was not unique to the dT15/rA16 primer/template. Long products were observed with dT15/rA30 and dG15/rC30 primer/templates (Fig.6). The efficiency of formation of products greater than unit length was sensitive to sequence composition. The magnitude of label incorporated into products from the dG15/rC30 reaction was reduced by an order of magnitude relative to that from the dT15/rA30reaction (cf. Fig. 3, B and C). Because previous studies of 3Dpol employing long, homopolymeric substrates appeared to produce unit-length products (5Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Neufeld K.L. Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24212-24219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Paul A.V. Cao X. Harris K.S. Lama J. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29173-29181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the formation of products greater than unit length on short, homopolymeric substrates was not expected. However, this phenomenon has been reported for most classes of nucleic acid polymerase studied to date. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain formation of these products (30Falvey A.K. Weiss G.B. Krueger L.J. Kantor J.A. Anderson W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Buiser R.G. DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), and three possible mechanisms are illustrated in Fig. 7. The first possibility is a distributive slippage mechanism (Fig. 7,i) in which the polymerase dissociates from primer/template, the primer terminus realigns relative to template, and enzyme rebinds and extends. Several iterations of this pathway would yield products greater than unit length. A second possibility is a processive slippage mechanism (Fig. 7, ii). Again, realignment of the primer occurs relative to template; however, polymerase does not dissociate. Finally, template switching (copy-choice recombination) may be the mechanism of formation of products greater than unit length (Fig. 7,iii). Polymerase, in complex with nascent chain, dissociates from template (donor) and binds to another (acceptor). A permutation of this mechanism would require polymerase to reach the end of template for efficient template switching to occur (forced-copy-choice recombination). Although template switching via a copy-choice mechanism could occur before, during, or after polymerase reaches the end of template, template switching would occur most frequently once polymerase reaches the end of donor template via a forced copy-choice mechanism. While a distributive slippage mechanism has been proposed for DNA polymerase I to explain formation of long products from short primer/templates consisting of 3-nt repeats (33Schlötterer C. Tautz D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), a processive slippage mechanism has been suggested for T7 DNA polymerase on the same substrates (33Schlötterer C. Tautz D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). In the case of the reverse transcriptases from avian myeloblastosis virus (30Falvey A.K. Weiss G.B.

Chem. 1991; 266: 13103-13109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human immunodeficiency virus (32Huber H.E. McCoy J.M. Seehra J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4669-4678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a template-switching mechanism has been proposed to explain products greater than unit length on a poly(rA) template. As slippage was a very probable explanation for formation of long products, our initial experiments were designed to distinguish between a distributive and a processive slippage mechanism. If slippage were occurring by a distributive mechanism, then long products should not form in the presence of a trap for free enzyme. In contrast to results obtained with the encephalomyocarditis 3Dpol (34Sankar S. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10168-10176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), heparin is a very effective inhibitor of poliovirus 3Dpol with aK i in the 30 nm range (Fig.8). When a reaction containing dT15/rA30 primer/template, [α-32P]UTP, and heparin was initiated by addition of poliovirus polymerase, a significant level of nucleotide incorporation was not observed during a 60 min incubation period (Fig.9 A, Pre-Trap). However, when polymerase and primer/template were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction initiated by addition of [α-32P]UTP and heparin, the initial rate of nucleotide incorporation was unchanged relative to a reaction performed in the absence of trap (Fig. 9A, cf. Trap and No Trap). The reaction terminated prematurely relative to that in the absence of trap; therefore, products most likely result from complexes that assembled during preincubation. Analysis of reaction products by phosphorimaging after denaturing PAGE indicated that long products formed in the presence of heparin, i.e. without dissociation of polymerase (Fig. 9 B). These data are consistent with a processive slippage mechanism.Figure 9Heparin-resistant complexes produce long products. A, reactions contained 3Dpol (0.5 μm) and dT15/rA30 (20 μm), with or without heparin 6000 (100 μm). 3Dpol was incubated with dT15/rA30at 37 °C for 1 min and the reaction was initiated by addition of UTP (•, No Trap) or UTP and heparin (▪,Trap).

In the present work, GATA-6 mRNA was detected in adult mouse lung, purified mouse type II epithelial cells, and differentiated mouse pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (MLE-15 cells), being co-expressed with TTF-1 mRNA. In order to test whether GATA factors regulated TTF-1 gene transcription, GATA-5 and -6 expression vectors were co-transfected with TTF-1 luciferase expression vector. GATA-6, but not GATA-5, markedly activated TTF-1 gene transcription in HeLa cells.

TTF-1 is expressed in developing thyroid and respiratory epithelium, as well as in subsets of cells in the embryonic diencephalon (2Lazzaro D. Price M. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the fetal lung, TTF-1 is expressed in highly regulated pattern in subsets of respiratory epithelial cells, both in the conducting and peripheral airways and lung saccules (3Boshart M. Klüppel M.

The level of expression of TTF-1 mRNA is generally higher in fetal than in postnatal lung, being confined primarily to subsets of bronchiolar and type II epithelial cells in the postnatal human and mouse lung. TTF-1 binds to and activates the transcription of a number of genes expressed selectively in thyroid (e.g. thyroperoxidase, thyroglobulin, and the sodium-iodide transporter) (6Francis-Lang H.

Deletion of TTF-1 in transgenic mice causes severe thyroid and lung hypoplasia (13Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J.

Thus, TTF-1 modulates both lung morphogenesis and respiratory epithelial cell gene expression in the developing and postnatal lung. TTF-1 is expressed in the progenitor cells of the lung buds early in rat, mouse, and human development. TTF-1 is encoded by a single gene in humans located on chromosome 14q13 (1Guazzi S. Price M.

The 5′ regulatory regions of the human and rat TTF-1 genes have been studied in vitro(15Lonigro R. De Felice M. Biffali E. Macchia P.E. Damante G. Asteria C. Di Lauro R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ikeda K. Shaw-White J.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3626-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TTF-1 transcription was enhanced by HNF-3β, which bound to two distinct sites located at bp −135 to −124 and −14 to −3 relative to the major start of transcription in the human gene, suggesting that TTF-1 regulation may be influenced by other transcription factors expressed in the foregut endoderm (19Ikeda K. Shaw-White J.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3626-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The GATA family of transcription factors includes a family of zinc finger domain-containing nuclear proteins that includes at least six distinct proteins that are expressed in a variety of tissues. GATA family members, particularly GATA-1, -2, and -3, were initially identified as important in the control of gene regulation during hematopoiesis (20Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Gene. Develop. 1990; 4: 1650-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Gene targeting of GATA-1, -2, and -3 demonstrated their important roles in the development of the hematopoietic system, being critical for gene expression and development of erythroid cell lineages in the developing mouse embryo (21Fujiwara Y. Browne C.P. Cunniff K. Goff S.C. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12355-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 22Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F.

Genet. 1995; 11: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). More recently, several of the GATA family members were identified in nonhematopoietic sites including the heart, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. The finding that GATA-4, -5, and -6 are expressed in the foregut or cardiac regions of the developing embryo suggested their potential role in organogenesis and gene expression in the heart and lung (25Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). GATA-5 and -6 are expressed in developing mouse lung, GATA-6 being detected primarily in epithelial cell respiratory tubules of the fetal lung, in a pattern similar to that previously described for TTF-1. The finding that, in the heart, Nkx2.5 (structurally closely related to TTF-1) and GATA-4 interact in the regulation of cardiac specific gene expression, suggested that GATA family members and TTF-1 might interact in respiratory epithelial cells (28Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). The present work was undertaken to determine whether GATA-5 or -6 was expressed in respiratory epithelial cells in vivo andin vitro and whether they might play a role in the regulation of TTF-1 gene expression, thereby influencing TTF-1 transcriptional targets. GATA-6, but not GATA-5, was expressed at high levels in the mouse pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells in vitroand in freshly isolated rat type II epithelial cells. GATA-6 activated a regulatory region of the mouse TTF-1 gene in HeLa cells and in human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells (H441 cells). Cell lines were maintained in standard tissue culture conditions prior to isolation of RNA. Rat type II epithelial cells were isolated after protease digestion of adult rat lung as described previously (29Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated by an adapted method of Chirgwin et al. (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed directly on the tissue culture plate using 4 mguanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 25 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol. Tissue was homogenized in the same buffer. Phase lock gels (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) were used to prepare RNA. RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. Fifteen μg of total RNA were loaded onto a 0.8% formaldehyde gel and transferred to Maximum strength Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell) and bound to the filter by UV cross-linking in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Hybridization was done in 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 2.5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, and 200 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42° C. A 129SvJ mouse liver genomic DNA library (Lambda DASH II, Stratagene) was provided by Marcia M. Shull, University of Cincinnati. Approximately 3.4 genome equivalents were plated and lifted onto Hybond N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was screened with a 1.3-kb rat TTF-1 cDNA provided by Dr. R. Di Lauro (Naples, Italy). The probe was labeled by random primer labeling and hybridized at a concentration of 106dpm/ml in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 55° C. The final wash conditions were 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55° C for 30 min. Four clones contained the TTF-1 gene, the largest clone containing 1.7 kb of 5′-flanking sequence. Sequence of the promoter region was determined by using the dideoxy sequencing reaction product (Sequenase, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Restriction fragments were used to compare the maps of the clone with mouse genomic DNA. Primers were used to amplify the desired region of the TTF-1 gene. The 3′-end of all constructs included all of the 5′-untranslated region up to, but not including, the ATG and had aHindIII site inserted in to aid in cloning. The DNA fragment was subcloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). The following primers were used to generate the luciferase constructs (5′-3′ location followed by sequence): +200 to +185, CCCAAGCTTGATTCGGCGTCGGCTG; −168 to −149, TTGAGACCTAAAAATCTTGA; −110 to −87, GTAAGCTAATTATCTCGGGCAAGA; −95 to −72, TCCCCGGGCAAGATGTAGGCTTCT; −87 to −69, ATGTAGGCTTCTATTGTCT; −110 to −87 (GATA mutant upper), GTAAGCTAATGAATTCGGGCAAGA; −87 to −110 (GATA mutant lower), TCTTGCCCGAATTCATTAGCTTAC; pGL2-Basic (GL1) (Promega), TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG. To make mTTF-1–142 luciferase, primers +200 to +185 and −168 to −149 were used on a mouse genomic clone. The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with HindIII and cloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega). To make mTTF-1–110 luciferase primers, +200 to +185 and −110 to −87 were used. To make mTTF-95, primers +200 to +185 and −95 to −72 were used. To make mTTF-1–87 luciferase primers, +200 to +185 and −87 to −69 were used. To make a construct mutant for GATA binding, primers +200 to +185 and −110 to −87 mutant primer and in a separate reaction primers GL1 and −87 to −110 mutant primer were used on a mTTF-1–142 template. Products were gel-purified and the combined in a polymerase chain reaction with primers +200 to +185 and GL1. This product was digested with HindIII, cloned into pGL2-Basic. The resultant plasmid was called mTTF-1–142 GATA mutant luciferase. The veracity of mutations was confirmed by both restriction analysis and nucleotide sequencing of double-stranded templates. Cell transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method except that glycerol shock was not used (31Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Transfections were done in six-well plates with 0.5 pmol of reporter luciferase construct, 0.2 pmol of transactivator (or empty vector), and 0.1 pmol of CMV-β-galactosidase to normalize for transfection efficiency. CMV-rTTF-1 was a gift of Dr. R. Di Lauro (Stazione Zoologica, A. Dohrn, Naples, Italy), and CMV-GATA-5 and CMV-GATA-6 were a gift of Dr. J. Molkentin (Division of Molecular Cardiology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). Fresh control medium was added approximately 20 h after transfection. Cells were harvested in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). The lysates were prepared and aliquots assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity with a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The normalized luciferase activity of the mTTF promoter was divided by the normalized luciferase activity of pGL2-Basic in the presence of the appropriate transactivating plasmid to determine relative luciferase activity. Cell lines were maintained in standard tissue culture conditions prior to making the nuclear extracts. Cells were cooled to 4° C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped off of the plates. Cells were spun at 3000 rpm at 4° C for 5 min and then washed again twice with phosphate-buffered saline before lysing. Cells were then resuspended in three packed cell volumes of lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 100 μmdithiothreitol, and 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then vortexed at medium speed for 10 s and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were then pelleted at 3000 rpm and 4° C for 5 min. The pellet fraction contained the nuclei. One packed volume of extract buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 25% glycerol, 100 μm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the nuclei and vortexed at medium speed every minute for 10 min. The nuclear extracts were then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, aliquoted into chilled tubes, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80° C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed at a concentration of 250 mm in 250 mm Tris (pH 7.8) at 95° C for 15 min and then cooled slowly to room temperature overnight and stored at −20° C. The annealed oligonucleotides were diluted to 5 mm in the same buffer. Probes were labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. End-labeled probes were purified from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP by an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Nick column eluted in a 400-μl volume. Unlabeled probe was placed on a Nick column at a 10-fold greater concentration and also eluted in 400 μl. Oligonucleotides used in shifts consisted of nucleotides −110 to −87 and their complement −87 to −110, and the GATA mutant consisting of the nucleotide −110 to −87 region (and complement containing the mutation TTATCT → TGAATT). Oligonucleotides were generated from the published sequence of the histidine decarboxylase promoter (33Dimaline R. Campbell B.J. Watson F. Sandvik A.K. Struthers J. Noble P.J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1559-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) consisting of the sequence TACTGCTGATAAGGAAA and complement TTTCCTTATCAGCAGTA. The procedure for EMSA was adapted from methods previously described (34Hennighausen L. Lubon H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 721-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of extract and 10 μl of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor DNA (125 nm) were incubated in the same volume of buffer consisting of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm EDTA, 200 ng/ml poly(dI-dC), 4 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2, 40% glycerol, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 10 min on ice. One μl of 12.5 nm labeled probe was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 10 min on ice. Supershifts were performed by preincubating anti-GATA-6 antiserum or control rabbit serum with the labeled oligonucleotide under similar assay conditions. GATA-6 rabbit polyclonal antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth Walsh (Tufts University, Boston). Bound and free probe were resolved by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recombinant rat TTF-1 homeodomain and supershift with rabbit anti-TTF-1 were performed as described previously (9Bohinski R.J. DiLauro R. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Five percent gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 29:1, 0.5× TBE, 2.5% glycerol, 1.5 mm thick) were run in 0.5× TBE running buffer at constant current (30 mA) for approximately 85 min. Gels were blotted to Whatman 3 MM paper, dried under vacuum, and exposed to x-ray film from 4 h to overnight at room temperature. Northern blot analysis of mRNA obtained from various respiratory epithelial cells and nonpulmonary cells was used to assess expression of GATA-5, GATA-6, and TTF-1 mRNAs. GATA-5 and -6 mRNAs were readily identified in RNA isolated from whole mouse lung, migrating as 8.0- and 3.2-kb species, respectively (Fig.1). GATA-6, but not GATA-5, mRNAs were detected at high concentrations in freshly isolated rat type II epithelial cells, previously shown to express TTF-1 and varying amounts of TTF-1 target genes including surfactant protein A, B, and C (14Ikeda K.

Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3626-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GATA-6 and TTF-1 were also co-expressed in various SV40 large T immortalized clonal mouse lung epithelial cell lines, including MLE-15 and MLE-F6 cells; however, GATA-6 was not readily detected in H441 human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells by Northern blot analysis. GATA-6 mRNA was detected in 3T3 cells and in SV40 large T antigen immortalized fetal mouse lung mesenchymal cells (mFLM cells). Neither GATA-6 nor TTF-1 mRNA was detected in HeLa cells (data not shown). GATA-5 mRNA was not detected in H441, MLE pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells or in type II cells. Thus, GATA-6 and TTF-1 were co-expressed in various differentiated pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells and in freshly isolated rat type II cells, consistent with the finding that both mRNAs were detected in subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the fetal mouse lung (26Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In contrast, GATA-5 mRNA was not readily identified in the immortalized respiratory epithelial cells or in type II cells, consistent with its localization in nonepithelial cells in the developing mouse lung as assessed by in situhybridization (26Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Tang Z. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 27Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The co-localization of GATA-6 and TTF-1 with TTF-1 targets including SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C in various respiratory epithelial cells is consistent with the possibility that GATA-6 may influence transcription of TTF-1 or its target genes. Inspection of the 5′ region of the mouse TTF-1 gene revealed the nucleotide sequence TTATCT, located at −101 to −96 relative to the major transcription start site, consistent with its role as a potential GATA cis-acting element. Previous work from this laboratory identified a large DNase protected site by in situ footprint analysis with nuclear extracts from MLE-15 cells in this region (14Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Shaw-White J.R. Stahlman M.T. Boutell C.J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8108-8114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of this region of the TTF-1 gene is highly conserved in human rat and mouse TTF-1 genes. The potential GATA site was located near the element TGTTT, previously demonstrated to bind HNF-3β, activating TTF-1 gene promoter activity (19Ikeda K. Shaw-White J.R. Wert S.E. Whitsett J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3626-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The potential GATA site was also located close to a potential TTF-1 site (CAAG), located 5 bp from the GATA site. To test whether GATA family members might regulate TTF-1 promoter activity, the 5′ region of the mouse TTF-1 gene was ligated to the luciferase genes to produce mTTF-1–142. This region of the TTF-1 gene contains 142 bp 5′ of the primary transcription start site, as well as 5′-untranslated sequence derived from the major TTF-1 transcript (Fig.2). This 5′-untranslated region encodes two alternative transcripts and includes a small potential intron (15Lonigro R. De Felice M. Biffali E. Macchia P.E. Damante G. Asteria C. Di Lauro R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 251-261PubMed Google Scholar). Transient co-transfection experiments were performed in which mTTF-1–142 was co-transfected with expression vectors encoding mouse GATA-5 (CMV-GATA-5) and GATA-6 (CMV-GATA-6) into HeLa cells. mTTF-1–142 was markedly activated by co-transfection with GATA-6 but not GATA-5 (Fig. 3) Likewise, cotransfection of GATA-6 activated the mTTF-1–142 luciferase construct after transfection into H441 adenocarcinoma cells from 17 ± 2.3 to 28 ± 3.6 luciferase units (mean ± S.E.,p < 0.01). Deletion mutations were made producing vectors at −110, −95, and −87 bp relative to the start of transcription of the TTF-1 gene. In HeLa cells, significant stimulation of TTF-1 promoter activity by GATA-6 was observed with 5′ sequences from −110 bp; however, maximal basal and stimulated activities were observed when a larger region (−142 bp) was included. The nucleotide sequences between −110 and −95 contained a region that encodes a consensus GATA binding site TTATCT (Fig.4). Mutation of the GATA site in mTTF-1–142 (TTATCT to TGAATT) completely inhibited transactivation by GATA-6 after co-transfection in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). Thus, a GATA-6 response element was located at −101 to −96 in the murine TTF-1 promoter. In contrast to the findings in HeLa cells, transfection of MLE-15 cells with CMV-GATA-6 did not further transactivate the wild type TTF-1–142 construct, perhaps related to the high levels of exogenous GATA-6 expression in this cell line. Luciferase activity of the mTTF-1–142 (TGAATT mutant) construct was similar to the wild type construct in MLE-15 cells (data not shown).Figure 4A site of GATA-6 activation is located between −142 and −95. Deletion analysis was used to identify the site of GATA-6 activation on the mTTF-1 promoter. GATA-6-dependent activity was lost in deletions between −110 and −95 in the mTTF-1 promoter; however, maximal GATA-6-dependent activity was observed with the larger construct −142. A consensus site (TTACTC) for GATA binding was located at −96 to −101 in this region. This site was mutated to TGAATT and tested for GATA-6 transactivation in HeLa cells. Relative luciferase values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The deletion and mutant constructs are further described under “Experimental Procedures” and in Fig. 1. Values represent mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. * and **,p < 0.001 and p < 0.005, respectively, versus pCDNA1.1 control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Electromobility shift assays were performed using nuclear extracts from MLE-15, MLE-F6, 3T3, and H441 and HeLa cells (Fig. 5). A gel shift was readily detected with an oligonucleotide −110 to −87 containing the GATA site with nuclear extracts from MLE-15, MLE-F6, and 3T3 cells consistent with the detection of GATA-6 mRNA as determined by Northern blot analysis. This DNA complex was lacking in HeLa and H441 cells, also consistent with the lack of GATA-6 mRNA in these cells. The protein-DNA complex was inhibited by paucity or absence of the unlabeled self-oligonucleotide. The same oligonucleotide containing the mutated GATA site (−110 to −87) (TTATCT → TGAATT) did not compete for binding to MLE-15 cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 5, lane 3). An oligonucleotide containing the GATA-6 site identified in the histidine decarboxylase gene (33Dimaline R. Campbell B.J. Watson F. Sandvik A.K. Struthers J. Noble P.J. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1559-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) bound to MLE-15 nuclear extracts. Binding of the histidine carboxylase GATA-6 site was competed by self oligonucleotide and by the oligonucleotide containing the GATA-6 site from the TTF-1 gene. Formation of the complex with the histidine decarboxylase GATA-6 site was not inhibited by the oligonucleotide containing the mutant GATA site (Fig.6), further demonstrating the specificity of the interaction.Figure 6The GATA-6 binding site in the mouse TTF-1 gene competes with a GATA-6 binding site from the histidine decarboxylase gene.

The complex was inhibited by 100× self-competitor and labeled self (lane 2). The addition of an unlabeled oligonucleotide consisting of −110 to −87 in the mTTF-1 gene resulted in a loss of this complex (lane 3, TTF-1).

https://openalex.org/W2015757949,"Transcription factors of the ONECUT class, whose prototype is hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6, are characterized by the presence of a single cut domain and by a peculiar homeodomain (Lannoy, V. J., Bürglin, T. R., Rousseau, G. G., and Lemaigre, F. P. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 13552–13562). We report here the identification and characterization of human OC-2, the second mammalian member of this class. TheOC-2 gene is located on human chromosome 18. The distribution of OC-2 mRNA in humans is tissue-restricted, the strongest expression being detected in the liver and skin. The amino acid sequence of OC-2 contains several regions of high similarity to HNF-6. The recognition properties of OC-2 for binding sites present in regulatory regions of liver-expressed genes differ from, but overlap with, those of HNF-6. Like HNF-6, OC-2 stimulates transcription of the hnf-3βgene in transient transfection experiments, suggesting that OC-2 participates in the network of transcription factors required for liver differentiation and metabolism.

The identification of transcription factors has provided insight into the mechanisms of the control of gene expression. Some of these factors contain a DNA-binding region called the homeodomain. The homeodomain proteins are evolutionarily conserved and play an important role in cell differentiation and in morphogenesis (1Kenyon C. Cell. 1994; 78: 175-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 2Lawrence P.A. Morata G.

Several homeodomain proteins contain a second type of DNA-binding domain. This is the case for the proteins of the CUT superclass, in which the second DNA-binding domain is called cut because it was initially described in the Drosophila CUT protein (5Blochlinger K.

Homeodomains, which are 60 residues long, are organized in three α-helices (for a review on homeodomain-DNA interactions, see Refs. 10Kornberg T.B. J. Biol.

The third helix, called the recognition helix, contacts the DNA and is crucial for sequence-specific binding. Within this helix, residue 48 is part of a hydrophobic core. Whereas residue 48 is a tryptophan in all known homeodomains, it is a phenylalanine in the ONECUT proteins. Residue 50 is also located in the recognition helix. Mutations at this position often lead to changes in the sequence specificity of DNA binding (13Hanes S.D. Brent R.

Bioessays. 1992; 14: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the ONECUT proteins, a methionine is found at position 50. This amino acid is never found at this position in other homeodomains.Our previous experiments showed that HNF-6 can bind to a number of DNA sites, which differ slightly in terms of sequence, and that the cut domain is required for binding of HNF-6 to all the sites tested (8Lannoy V.J.

These experiments ascribed a dual role to the peculiar homeodomain of HNF-6. They showed that this domain is involved in DNA binding, but only for a subset of the sites recognized by HNF-6. They also showed that the homeodomain is involved in transcriptional activation, but only of those genes for which the binding of HNF-6 does not require its homeodomain. By mutational analysis, we demonstrated that phenylalanine 48 and methionine 50 play a role in this transcriptional activating function of the HNF-6 homeodomain (8Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R.

This work indicated that the linker region between the cut domain and homeodomain of HNF-6 is important for DNA binding (8Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol.

HNF-6β (491 residues) is identical to HNF-6α (465 residues), except that it contains an insert of 26 amino acids in the linker region. These two isoforms differ in DNA binding specificity and kinetics (8Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol.

The DNA-binding domains of these C. elegans proteins display DNA binding properties similar to those of HNF-6 (8Lannoy V.J. Bürglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol.

This indicates that these properties have been evolutionarily conserved and are therefore important for basic regulatory processes that are common to nematodes and mammals. The existence of several members of the ONECUT class inC. elegans prompted us to search for mammalian members of this class that are distinct from HNF-6. We describe here a new member, which we call OC-2, of the ONECUT class. The identification of transcription factors has provided insight into the mechanisms of the control of gene expression. Some of these factors contain a DNA-binding region called the homeodomain. The homeodomain proteins are evolutionarily conserved and play an important role in cell differentiation and in morphogenesis (1Kenyon C.

Here we report the interaction of HBx and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and their effects on the enhancer/promoters of hepatitis B virus (HBV). A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay showed that the cotransfection of HBx and C/EBPα strongly activated the enhancer II/pregenomic promoter of HBV in a synergistic manner. This effect was also observed in the heterologous expression system with promoters of SV40 and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes. Serial deletion analysis of the enhancer II/pregenomic promoter identified the responsible region (nucleotides 1639–1679), in which two C/EBP-binding sites are located. An in vitro interaction assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that HBx augmented the DNA binding activity of C/EBPα by direct interaction with it, and its basic leucine zipper domain was responsible for the interaction with HBx. Domain analysis of HBx showed that the central region (amino acids 78–103) was necessary for direct interaction with C/EBPα. However, the complete form of HBx was necessary for the synergistic activation of the HBV pregenomic promoter. These results suggest that the interaction of HBx and C/EBPα enhances the transcription of the HBV pregenomic promoter for the effective life cycle of HBV in hepatocytes.

Two distinct functions and these alternatives of HBx action may explain the multifunctional role of HBxin vivo. Although the role of HBx during the infection of HBV is still unclear, it seems to play an essential role in infection by woodchuck hepatitis B virus (27Chen H. Kaneko S. Girones R. Anderson R.W.

Chisaka O. Yamamoto S. Matsubara K. Koshy R. Virology. 1993; 195: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) increases its importance in the HBV life cycle. A binding site for AP-1, a ubiquitous transcription factor, in enhancer I is the only cis-element of HBV yet known to respond functionally to HBx (7Choi C.Y. Choi B.H. Park G.T. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16934-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) was first identified in rat liver (31Johnson P.F.

Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), where it plays a key role in cell differentiation (33Timchenko N.A.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 168-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). C/EBP belongs to the bZip family of transcription factors and activates transcription of several genes through its binding sites (a consensus site: 5′-RTTGCGYAAY-3′) (35Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) in liver and fat cells. C/EBP has been shown to bind and modulate enhancer I (36Dikstein R. Faktor O. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell.

A possible role of C/EBP in the HBx-stimulated expression of promoters other than HBV has been previously suggested by indirect evidence (39Mahe Y. Mukaida N. Kuno K. Akiyama M. Ikeda N. Matsushima K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13759-13763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Unger T. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1889-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the course of our study, a physical interaction of HBx and C/EBPβ without any functional implications in vivo was reported (20Barnabas S. Hai T. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20684-20690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We investigated a role for HBx in C/EBPα function and their effects on the HBV enhancer/promoters in HepG2 cells. We report here that the direct interaction of HBx and C/EBPα strongly activated the enhancer II/pregenomic promoter (EnII/Cp) of HBV in a synergistic manner. The pCENCAT reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting the XhoI-AluI fragment (nt 127–1873) of HBV subtype adr-k (41Rho H.M. Kim K.T. Hyun S.W. Kim Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which contains the upstream enhancer, the enhancer I/X promoter (EnI/Xp), and EnII/Cp, in front of the CAT reporter gene (see Fig. 1 A). Plasmids pUEIXp and pCpBm were constructed by dividing the HBV enhancer/promoters using the BamHI site (nt 1937) into the regions containing the upstream enhancer and EnI/Xp, and EnII/Cp, respectively. The pEIXp plasmid was constructed by deleting theXhoI-AccI fragment (nt 127–1070) containing the upstream enhancer from pUEIXp. The derivatives of pCpBm were constructed by serially digesting the plasmid with SacII (pCpSc), ApaLI (pCpAp), StyI (pCpSy),HincII (pCpHc), and DraI (pCpDa) as described previously (42Park G.T. Yi Y.W. Choi C.Y. Rho H.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The position of each deletion site is indicated in Fig. 2 A. The pC/EBP-CAT reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting eight copies of the consensus C/EBP-binding site (5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′) into the BglII site of the pCATpromoter (Promega) containing the minimal SV40 early promoter. The pBLCAT2 plasmid has a minimal promoter (−150 to +50) of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene that contains its own C/EBP-binding site (43Graves B.J. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L.

Purified MBP was added to the reaction mixtures without MBP-X protein to adjust the amount of total proteins (lanes 1 and 6). A 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled probes (self) and the consensus (C/EBPwt) and mutant C/EBP (C/EBPmt) oligonucleotides were added as competitors (lanes 3–5 and 8–10).

L. McKnight. The bacterial expression vectors for full-length C/EBPα and the bZip domain of C/EBPα (pGST-C/EBPα and pGST-bZip, respectively) were constructed by inserting theNcoI-NcoI fragment (amino acids 1–358) and theSmaI-NcoI fragment (amino acids 245–358) of C/EBPα cDNA into the SmaI site of pGEX-4T1 and pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. The eukaryotic expression vector for HBx (pSVX2) was constructed by placing its cDNA (nt 1371–1833) under the control of the SV40 enhancer and early promoter. The derivatives of pSVX2 (pSVXΔBA, pSVXΔBH, and pSVXΔSH) were constructed using the BamHI,ApaLI, and HincII sites, respectively, within the HBx cDNA as described for Fig. 5 A. The bacterial expression vectors for HBx and its derivatives (pMBP-X, pMBP-Mx, and pMBP-Sx) were described previously (7Choi C.Y. Choi B.H. Park G.T. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16934-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transfected with reporter and activator plasmids as indicated in the figure legends using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with BES as described previously (7Choi C.Y. Choi B.H. Park G.T. Rho H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16934-16939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The total amount of transfected DNA for each reaction was adjusted to 9 μg with pUC19. The CAT assay was performed with cell extracts normalized for the total amount of protein using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). CAT activity was quantified by measuring the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms using a Fuji BAS bioimaging analyzer. The GST-fused C/EBPα and MBP-fused X proteins were affinity-purified, and the amount of purified proteins was determined by the Bradford assay. DNA binding reactions were carried out with the indicated amount of proteins as described previously (7Choi C.Y. Choi B.H. Park G.T. Rho H.M. J. Biol.

Samples were loaded on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (40:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Antibody against human C/EBPα was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Sequences homologous to the consensus C/EBP site are underlined. The sequences of the wild-type and mutant C/EBP-binding sites are as follow: C/EBPwt, 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA-3′; and C/EBPmt, 5′-TGCAGAGACTAGTCTCTGCA-3′. The consensus C/EBP site in C/EBPwt and the mutated sequences in C/EBPmt are underlined. One milliliter of bacterial extracts containing GST-C/EBPα or GST-bZip were incubated with 20 μl of amylose resin bound to MBP or MBP-fused HBx proteins for 12 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing (10 × 10-min incubation with 1 ml of column buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm EGTA, and 10% glycerol)), bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of column buffer containing 10 mmmaltose. Ten microliters of eluted proteins were assayed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate buffer (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), briefly washed, and incubated with anti-C/EBPα antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at 25 °C. After extensive washing, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit mouse antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h at 25 °C. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HBV has been previously shown to have C/EBP-binding sites in the upstream enhancer, enhancer I , and EnII/Cp (37Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We first examined the effect of HBx and C/EBPα on the whole HBV enhancer/promoters (pCENCAT) in HepG2 cells, which contain low levels of C/EBPα compared with normal liver (45Friedman A.D. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes De v. 1989; 3: 1314-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The effects of both proteins on each enhancer/promoter (pCpBm, pUEIXp and pEIXp) were then examined. As shown in Fig. 1 B(lanes 3, 7, 11, and15), HBx alone activated all four reporters. In contrast to previous reports (36Dikstein R. Faktor O. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4427-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Virology. 1991; 183: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), C/EBPα alone neither activated nor repressed notably the HBV enhancer/promoters in our experiments (Fig.1 B, lanes 2, 6,10, and 14). However, cotransfection of HBx and C/EBPα significantly elevated the activities of pCENCAT and pCpBm plasmids (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and8), suggesting a synergistic effect of HBx and C/EBPα on HBV EnII/Cp. Contrary to our expectation, the cotransfection of HBx and C/EBPα had only a small effect on pUEIXp (Fig. 1 B,lane 12) and inhibited the activation of pEIXp by HBx (lane 16), although they have C/EBP-binding sites. By EMSA, purified C/EBPα efficiently bound to the known C/EBP site of enhancer I, but weakly bound and did not bind to the downstream and upstream C/EBP sites of the upstream enhancer, respectively (data not shown). When compared with the consensus sequence of C/EBP, the C/EBP site at the upstream site of the upstream enhancer (nt 974–995) does not have any homology, whereas the one at the downstream site (nt 1024–1046) and the other one in enhancer I (nt 1170–1198) have 80% homology (Table I). The discrepancy of the results from the CAT assay and EMSA indicates that C/EBPα did not act as an influential activator in EnI/Xp.Table ISequence comparison of the consensus C/EBP site in the HBV probes by EMSA in this studyHomologyC/EBPα binding%C/EBP consensus1-aRef. 35 and 49.5′-RTTGCGYAAY-3′UE1-bKnown C/EBP sites in the upstream enhancer (UE) and enhancer I (EnI) of HBV (36, 44) (data not shown).nt 974–995No homology−nt 1024–10465′-ATTGTGTAAT-3′ (inverted)80+EnI1-bKnown C/EBP sites in the upstream enhancer (UE) and enhancer I (EnI) of HBV (36, 44) (data not shown).nt 1170–11985′-GTTGCGTCAG-3′ (inverted)80++EnII/Cp1-cThe results are shown in Fig. 2 B.

Important bases are in boldface italic in the C/EBP consensus sequence. We analyzed further the EnII/Cp region that was highly activated by the cotransfection of HBx and C/EBPα (Fig. 1 B). Previously, HBV EnII/Cp has been shown to contain several C/EBP-binding sites (37Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To identify the responsible one in EnII/Cp, the effect of HBx and C/EBPα on the serial deletions of pCpBm was examined by CAT assay (Fig.2 A). The basal activities of plasmids pCpAp and pCpDa were lower than those of the other reporter plasmids, which is consistent with previous reports (42Park G.T. Yi Y.W. Choi C.Y. Rho H.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 46Park G.T. Choi C.Y. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2775-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The synergistic effect of HBx and C/EBPα was maintained on plasmid pCpSy, but not on plasmids pCpHc and pCpDa. In contrast, HBx alone slightly activated pCpHc. These results show that theStyI-HincII fragment (nt 1639–1679) in the enhancer II region is responsible for the synergistic effect of HBx and C/EBPα on the HBV pregenomic promoter. To find the binding site of C/EBPα in HBV EnII/Cp, we performed EMSA with oligonucleotides synthesized based on the sequences of the probable C/EBP sites and the previous data on this region (37Lopez-Cabrera M.

The consensus C/EBP site (C/EBPwt), used as a positive control, also bound to GST-C/EBPα (Fig. 2 B,lane 9). Siddiqui and co-workers (37Lopez-Cabrera M. Letovsky J. Hu K.-Q. Siddiqui A. Proc. Natl.

However, downstream C/EBP sites (nt 1740–1761, 1798–1822, and 1826–1846; known C/EBP sites depicted assites 3–5 in Fig. 2 A) were not bound by purified C/EBPα in our experiment (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6–8), although all these sequences have 60–70% homologies to the consensus C/EBP site (Table I). The discrepancy between our results and theirs may be due to the assay methods, and C/EBPα binding to DNA seems to require conservation"
https://openalex.org/W2000426427,"Dnm1p/Vps1p-like protein (DVLP) is a mammalian member of the dynamin GTPase family, which is classified into subfamilies on the basis of the structural similarity. Mammalian dynamins constitute the dynamin subfamily. DVLP belongs to the Vps1 subfamily, which also includes yeast Vps1p and Dnm1p. Typical structural features that discriminate between members of the Vps1 and dynamin subfamilies are that the former lacks the pleckstrin homology and Pro-rich domains. Dynamin exists as tetramers under physiological salt conditions, whereas under low salt conditions, it can polymerize into spirals that resemble the collar structures seen at the necks of constricted coated pits. In this study, we found that DVLP is also oligomeric, probably tetrameric, under physiological salt conditions and forms sedimentable large aggregates under low salt conditions. The data indicate that neither the pleckstrin homology nor Pro-rich domain is required for the self-assembly. Analyses using the two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation show that the N-terminal region containing the GTPase domain and a domain (DVH1) conserved across members of the dynamin and Vps1 subfamilies, can interact with the C-terminal region containing another conserved domain (DVH2). The data on the interdomain interaction of DVLP is compatible with the previous reports on the interdomain interaction of dynamin. Thus, the self-assembly mechanism of DVLP appears to resemble that of dynamin, suggesting that DVLP may also be involved in the formation of transport vesicles.

Many proteins that belong to the dynamin family have been identified in a variety of organisms ranging from yeasts to mammals. These proteins have a highly conserved N-terminal GTPase domain of ∼300 amino acids (for reviews, see Refs. 1Vallee R.B. Okamoto P.M.

Rev. 1995; 16: 590-607PubMed Google Scholar). The dynamin subfamily consists of mammalian dynamins I, II, and III, and the Drosophila shibire gene product. A second subfamily consists of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps1p and Dnm1p and a recently identified mammalian member designated DVLP 1The abbreviations used are: DVLP, Dnm1p/Vps1p-like protein; pleckstrin homology, HA, hemagglutinin; DTSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); β-Gal, β-galactosidase; DVH, dynamin/Vps1p homology; FL, full-length. 1The abbreviations used are: DVLP, Dnm1p/Vps1p-like protein; pleckstrin homology, HA, hemagglutinin; DTSP, dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate); β-Gal, β-galactosidase; DVH, dynamin/Vps1p homology; FL, full-length.(5Shin H.-W.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typical structural features that discriminate between members of the Vps1 and dynamin subfamilies are that the former lack the pleckstrin homology and Pro-rich domains, which are involved in interactions with phospholipids and proteins containing the SH3 domain, respectively. Two plant homologs, phragmoplastin and aG68/ADL1, are grouped into another subfamily. Interferon-inducible Mx proteins and yeast Mgm1p constitute the most diverged subfamily. Members of the dynamin and Vps1 subfamilies have been implicated in intracellular vesicular transport. Analyses using cells transfected with dynamin mutants and using Drosophila shibire mutants demonstrated that dynamins are responsible for budding of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane (9van der Bliek A.M.

It has also been reported that dynamin II is involved in transport from thetrans-Golgi network (13Jones S.M. Howell K.E. Henley J.R. Cao H. McNiven M.A. Science. 1998; 279: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Morphological analysis andin vitro experiments showed that dynamin self-assembles into rings and/or spirals around the necks of invaginated clathrin-coated pits, thereby suggesting a model that GTP hydrolysis of dynamin pinches off the budding vesicles (14Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 15Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Vps1p was identified as one of the gene products required for vacuolar protein sorting in yeast (16Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara P.J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and Dnm1p was then isolated as a homolog of Vps1p and may participate in an endocytic process (17Gammie A.E. Kurihara L.J. Vallee R.B. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recently, the mammalian protein most homologous to Vps1p and Dnm1p not only in the primary structure but also in the domain organization has been identified by us and others and designated DVLP (Dnm1p/Vps1p-like protein) (5Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), dymple (6Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J.

The most abundant form of DVLP consists of 736 amino acids, but some splicing variants are also present (6Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Yoon Y. Pitts K.R. Dahan S. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that DVLP is localized to a punctate cytoplasmic structures around the nucleus (5Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J.

Velocity sedimentation and gel filtration analyses and cross-linking experiments indicated that dynamin exists as homo-oligomers, mainly tetramers, under physiological salt conditions (15Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 18Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under low salt conditions, however, it co-assembles into polymers to form rings and/or spirals (15Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During the course of our experiments, we noticed a possibility that DVLP is also oligomeric. We therefore analyzed this phenomenon in detail. Construction of the expression vector for human DVLP with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope sequence (pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP) was described previously (5Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An expression vector for Myc-tagged DVLP (pcDNA3-MycN-DVLP) was constructed by replacing the fragment encoding the HA epitope of pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP with a double-stranded oligonucleotide for the Myc epitope. A vector for Myc-tagged DVLP(278–736) was constructed by replacing the entire DVLP portion of pcDNA3-MycN-DVLP with an MscI-NotI fragment of the DVLP cDNA. For the use in the two-hybrid analysis, bait and prey vectors for DVLP were constructed by ligation of a DNA fragment for DVLP from pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP into pGBT9 and pGAD10 (CLONTECH), respectively. Bait and prey vectors for deletion mutants (Fig. 1), except for the prey vector of DVLP(580–736) and DVLP(490–634), were constructed by utilizing the endogenous restriction sites of the DVLP cDNA; the DNA fragments of DVLP(580–736) and DVLP(490–634) were prepared by a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. Sources of antibodies used were as follows: monoclonal rat (3F10) and mouse (12CA5) anti-HA antibodies, Boehringer Mannheim; monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody (9E10), Berkeley Antibody Co.; peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; other secondary antibodies, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. A Clone 9 rat hepatocyte cell line stably expressing HA-tagged DVLP (Clone 9/DVLP-HA) was established by selection of clonal cell lines transfected with pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP in the presence of 800 μg/ml Geneticin (Wako Pure Chemicals). For immunofluorescence analyses, Clone 9 cells grown in wells of eight-well Lab-Tek-II chamber slides (Nunc) were transfected with pcDNA3-MycN-DVLP(278–736) alone or in combination with pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP using a TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (PanVera Corp.), cultured for 20 h, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (5Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Torii S. Banno T. Watanabe T. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11574-11580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells fixed and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min or those fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 50 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 4 °C were incubated with anti-HA and/or anti-Myc antibodies. The cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated and/or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies and observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (TCS-NT, Leica Lasertechnik). Clone 9/DVLP-HA cells were homogenized in two volumes of HCB150 (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl) by 5 sets of 20 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor, and the supernatant was used as a cytosol fraction. The cytosol fraction containing ∼500 μg of protein was applied to a Superdex 200 column (1.0 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with HCB150 and eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 0.2 ml that were collected were precipitated with cold acetone, dissolved and boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The blot was incubated sequentially with anti-HA antibody (3F10) and peroxidase-labeled anti-rat IgG, and detected using a Renaissance Chemiluminescence reagent Plus(NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clone 9/DVLP-HA cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in HCB150 containing 1% Triton X-100 and 10% glycerol. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge and then incubated at 4 °C for indicated time periods in the presence of 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DTSP) (Sigma). After the incubation, residual DTSP was quenched by the addition of glycine (final concentration, 100 mm). The mixture was then electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody as described above. The Clone 9/DVLP-HA cytosol in HCB150 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against HCB0 (no NaCl), HCB50 (50 mm NaCl), or HCB100 (100 mm NaCl). The samples were then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 15 min in the TLA 100.2 rotor. The resultant pellet and supernatant were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as described above. Yeast transformation and two-hybrid analysis were performed according to the instructions for the MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). Briefly, a yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with a pGBT9-based bait vector and a pGAD10-based prey vector and plated on a medium lacking Trp, Leu, and His and containing 10–25 mm 3-aminotriazole (Wako Pure Chemicals). After 5–7 days of incubation, colonies were tested for β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity by use of replica filter assay. β-Gal activity was also measured by a liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenylgalactoside as a substrate (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 13.6.2-13.6.5Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells transiently transfected with either pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP or pcDNA3-MycN-DVLP, or both were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmEDTA, 0.25 m NaCl containing a CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim)). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. A half of the lysates containing ∼20 μg of protein were directly subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using anti-HA (3F10) or anti-Myc (9E10) antibody. The other half was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis using the monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. Either pcDNA3-HAN-DVLP(1–489) alone, pcDNA3-MycN-DVLP(490–736) alone, or both was subjected to in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of an EXPRESS protein labeling mixture (NEN Life Science Products) using a TnT T7 transcription/translation system (Promega Corp.). The reaction product was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and protein A-Sepharose, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed using a BAS2000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film Co.). By indirect immunofluorescence analysis of Clone 9 cells transiently transfected with HA-tagged DVLP, we found that it associated with punctate cytoplasmic structures around the nucleus (6Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There was a possibility, however, that the staining pattern was caused by overexpression. We therefore established cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged DVLP at a moderate level. Fig. 2 A shows a typical staining pattern for DVLP in one (Clone 9/DVLP-HA) of the established cell lines. As in transiently transfected cells, DVLP was localized to punctate cytoplasmic structures in these stable transfectants. On the other hand, Kamimoto et al. (6Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have reported that a dymple/DVLP mutant lacking the N-terminal GTPase domain forms large cytoplasmic aggregates. In an attempt to reproduce their data, we made a similar construct, DVLP(278–736) (Fig.1), tagged with a Myc epitope and transiently expressed in Clone 9 cells. As shown in Fig.2 B, we could reproduce the data of Kamimoto et al. (6Kamimoto T. Nagai Y. Onogi H. Muro Y. Wakabayashi T. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1044-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar): the N-terminal deletion mutant was localized to large cytoplasmic aggregates. During the course of this experiment, we met with unexpected findings. In an attempt to discriminate unequivocally the localization of DVLP(278–736) from that of full-length DVLP (DVLP(FL)), we transfected the Myc-tagged DVLP(278–736) construct along with the HA-tagged DVLP(FL) construct into Clone 9 cells and double-stained with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies. We found that in some populations of the cells with a relatively low expression level of DVLP(278–736), the staining for the deletion mutant was superimposed on the punctate cytoplasmic staining for DVLP(FL) (Fig. 2, C and C′). In contrast, in another cell population expressing a relatively high level of DVLP(278–736) as evident from the intense staining for Myc, DVLP(FL) colocalized with DVLP(278–736) in large cytoplasmic aggregates (Fig. 2, D and D′). These observations suggest a possibility that DVLP may exist as oligomers/multimers intracellularly. To confirm the above speculation, a cytosolic extract was prepared from Clone 9/DVLP-HA cells using buffer containing a physiological concentration of NaCl (HCB150) and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex-200 column, and the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.3, DVLP-HA eluted from the gel with an apparent molecular mass of ∼320 kDa. Because the molecular mass of DVLP-HA monomer is ∼80 kDa (Fig. 3; also see Figs.4 and 7), the species of ∼320 kDa is probably a tetramer.Figure 4Cross-linking analysis. Clone 9/DVLP-HA cell lysates were untreated or treated with DTSP for indicated time periods and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Co-immunoprecipitation of HA- and Myc-tagged DVLP expressed in cells. Cell lysates were prepared from 293 cells transiently transfected with an expression vector for HA- or Myc-tagged DVLP or both. A, the cell lysates were directly analyzed by Western blotting (WB) with anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody.B, the lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody. A major band at ∼49 kDa is derived from IgG heavy chains.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To corroborate the gel filtration data, we then performed cross-linking studies. Clone 9/DVLP-HA cell lysates were treated with a cross-linker, DTSP, in HCB150, and the extent of cross-linking was monitored on Western blots. As shown in Fig. 4, a molecular species of ∼300 kDa appeared in a time-dependent manner, with disappearance of the ∼80-kDa band. It is also noteworthy that no dimer/trimer intermediates of DVLP were detected during the incubation, in contrast to cross-linking studies of dynamin (18Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26707-26714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), in which not only a tetramer but also dynamin species corresponding to a dimer and a trimer were observed. Collectively, these data indicate that DVLP is probably tetrameric in cells. Dynamin has been reported to self-assemble into rings and/or spirals under low salt conditions (15Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Warnock D.E. Baba T. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The dynamin assembly can be quantified by a sedimentation assay in which polymerized assembled dynamin appears in the pellet after high speed centrifugation. To examine whether DVLP also polymerizes under low salt conditions, the Clone 9/DVLP-HA cytosol in HCB150 was dialyzed against lower salt buffers and subjected to ultracentrifugation, and the resultant supernatants and pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.5, in higher salt buffers (HCB100 and HCB150), the largest fraction of DVLP remained in the supernatant, whereas in lower salt buffers (HCB0 and HCB50), a significant fraction sedimented. Densitometric analysis revealed that in HCB100 and HCB150 only ∼10 and <5%, respectively, of DVLP sedimented, whereas in HCB0 and HCB50, ∼80 and ∼40%, respectively, of DVLP assembled into sedimentable complexes. The experiments thus far suggest that, like dynamin, DVLP may exist as tetramers under physiological salt conditions and assemble into sedimentable complexes under low salt conditions. However, it was possible that such complexes might be formed by the aid of an unknown adaptor protein(s), because we used crude cytosolic extracts in the above experiments. To demonstrate the direct intermolecular interaction, we then used the yeast two-hybrid system. When bait and prey vectors fused to DVLP(FL) were co-transformed into reporter yeast cells, the co-transformant grew well on a plate lacking His (Fig.6 A) and showed a high level of β-Gal activity (Fig. 6 B). Co-transformation of the DVLP(FL) bait vector with either an empty prey vector (Fig. 6,A and B) or a prey vector fused to an unrelated protein (lamin; not shown) did not result in colony formation on the His-free plate nor show a significant β-Gal activity. The data therefore indicate a specific intermolecular interaction of DVLP. The above data demonstrated the intermolecular interaction of DVLPin vitro and in the heterologous yeast expression system. To demonstrate such an interaction in cells, we co-transfected cells with vectors for HA- and Myc-tagged DVLP(FL) and examined whether anti-HA antibody was able to co-immunoprecipitate Myc-tagged DVLP from lysate of the co-transfectant. Fig. 7 A shows the expression of both HA- and Myc-tagged DVLP in the co-transfectant. When the lysate of the co-transfectant was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and then subjected to Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody, a specific band of Myc-DVLP was detected (Fig.7 B), demonstrating the intermolecular interaction of DVLP in cells. To delineate domains of DVLP responsible for the intermolecular interaction, various deletion mutants were constructed and subjected to the two-hybrid analysis. We anticipated that a C-terminal domain, named dynamin/Vps1p homology 2 (DVH2), could be responsible for such an interaction, because this domain is significantly conserved in the dynamin and Vps1 subfamilies and has the potential to form a coiled-coil structure (1Vallee R.B. Okamoto P.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Shin H.-W. Shinotsuka C. Torii S. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be involved in homo- and hetero-oligomeric protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we first constructed bait and prey vectors for DVLP(490–736), which includes the DVH2 domain (Fig.1), and examined whether the homotypic interaction of the coiled-coil domain of DVLP occurred. However, we failed to detect such an interaction (Fig. 6). In contrast, when the prey vector for DVLP(490–736) was co-transformed with a bait vector for the deleted part, namely DVLP(1–489), a significant interaction was observed; the co-transformant grew well on the His-free plate, and its β-Gal activity approximated that of the DVLP(FL)-DVLP(FL) co-transformant (Fig. 6). A similar result was obtained using a combination of a bait vector for DVLP(490–736) and a prey vector for DVLP(1–489) (data not shown). A homotypic interaction of DVLP(1–489) was not detected (Fig.6). To corroborate the two-hybrid results, we examined whether in vitro translated HA-tagged DVLP(1–489) and Myc-tagged DVLP(490–736) can be co-immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig.8, the anti-HA antibody precipitated not only HA-tagged DVLP(1–489) but also Myc-tagged DVLP(490–736). Although the origin of a band between those of HA-DVLP(1–489) and Myc-DVLP(490–736) is not clear, it may be a degradation product or a not fully translated product of HA-DVLP(1–489), because the band was also detected in the lane in which the HA-DVLP(1–489) construct alone was subjected to in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. DVLP(1–489) covers the N-terminal GTPase domain and another conserved domain, named DVH1. In order to determine which region of DVLP(1–489) is responsible for the interaction with DVLP(490–736), we successively truncated the DVLP(1–489) construct from its C terminus (Fig. 1) and examined whether the truncation mutant was able to interact with DVLP(490–736) by the two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig.6 B, DVLP(1–424), which contains the largest part of DVH1 domain, was able to interact with DVLP(490–736). By contrast, DVLP(1–343), which lacks the DVH1 domain, was unable to interact with DVLP(490–736). These data indicate that the DVH1 domain is required for the interaction with the C-terminal DVH2-containing region. However, in addition to the DVH1 domain, the GTPase domain appears to be also required for the interaction, because DVLP(295–527), which lacks the GTP-binding domain, failed to show a significant interaction with DVLP(490–736). We then examined which region of DVLP(490–736) is responsible for the interaction with DVLP(1–489). DVLP(490–634) was unable to interact with DVLP(1–489), indicating that the DVH2 domain is required for the interaction with the N-terminal region. We then truncated successively the DVLP(490–736) construct from its N terminus (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 6 B, although DVLP(542–736) was capable of interacting with DVLP(1–489), DVLP(580–736) interacted no longer with the N-terminal region. These data indicate that although it is not conserved in the dynamin and Vps1 subfamilies, the region upstream of the DVH2 domain is also required for the interaction with the N-terminal region. DVLP shares some primary structural features with dynamin. In this study, we have shown that, as is the case for dynamin, DVLP may be tetrameric under physiological salt conditions and aggregates into sedimentable complexes under low salt conditions. The similarities not only in the structure but also in the complex formation make it tempting to speculate that DVLP plays a role in the formation of carrier vesicles in a manner similar to that of dynamin, although it is currently unclear which transport step(s) DVLP is involved in. Under the appropriate conditions, DVLP tetramers in the cytosol may assemble into rings and/or spirals at the necks of budding coated pits prior to vesicle fission. In this context, a recent report of Carr and Hinshaw (20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) is noteworthy. They have shown that even under physiological salt conditions, dynamin polymerizes into spirals in the presence of GDP and γ-phosphate analogues (aluminum fluoride and beryllium fluoride) or in the presence of GTPγS. We performed similar experiments for DVLP but failed to detect its assembly into sedimentable complexes in the presence of the GTP analogues under physiological salt conditions (data not shown). The reason for the difference between the behavior of dynamin and the behavior of DVLP is unclear. One possibility is that the difference may be caused by the difference in the used experimental system; Carr and Hinshaw (20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) used purified recombinant dynamin, whereas we used crude cytosolic extract containing DVLP. Indeed, using the cytosolic fraction of Clone 9/DVLP-HA cells, we could not detect sedimentable complexes of dynamin II in the presence of the GTP analogues under physiological salt conditions (data not shown). To address this issue, experiments using purified DVLP will be required. Attempts are under way to express and purify recombinant DVLP using a baculovirus system. Analyses using the two-hybrid system have shown the intermolecular interaction of DVLP and delineated domains of DVLP responsible for the interaction; the N-terminal region containing the GTPase and DVH1 domains can interact with the C-terminal DVH2-containing region. Because these three domains are highly conserved in the dynamin and Vps1 subfamilies, a common mechanism may govern the interdomain interactions of dynamin and DVLP. Indeed, our data are in good agreement with recent data on intermolecular and interdomain interactions of dynamin (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol.

Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and assemble into spirals (20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); (ii) an N-terminal fragment of dynamin that is deduced to contain the GTPase and DVH1 domains and a C-terminal fragment that is deduced to contain the DVH2 domain, both of which are generated by limited endoproteolysis, are co-purified by chromatography (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 24Lin H.C. Barylko B. Achiriloaie M. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25999-26004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); (iii) the N-terminal and DVH2-containing proteolytic fragments can be cross-linked with each other (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and co-assemble into spirals (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,20Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); and (iv) the pleckstrin homology domain, which is not present in DVLP, is not required for the co-assembly nor cross-linked with the N-terminal or DVH2-containing fragment (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In this context, it is also noteworthy that the DVH2-containing fragment appears to stimulate the GTPase activity of the N-terminal fragment (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The interaction between the region containing the GTPase domain and the DVH2 domain may regulate the assembly/disassembly of the dynamin family proteins. On the basis of the present data, three models for the tetramer formation of DVLP are possible (Fig. 9). In the first model (model 1), an interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions occurs in the same DVLP polypeptide, and the four monomer units then assemble into a tetramer. In the second (model 2), the interaction occur between two adjacent antiparallel polypeptides, and the two dimer units then assemble into a tetramer. In the third (model 3), the interactions sequentially occur between adjacent parallel polypeptides, and a ring-like structure composed of four polypeptides is thereby formed. We favor the last model, because we could not detect any homotypic interactions between domains of DVLP by the two-hybrid analysis or any dimeric intermediates by the gel filtration and cross-linking analyses. In contrast, Muhlberg et al. (19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) favored model 2 for the tetramer formation of dynamin on the basis of their analyses using its proteolytic fragments. A difference between our data on DVLP using the two-hybrid system and the data on dynamin using proteolytic fragments is that in the latter, homotypic interactions between the N-terminal fragments and between the DVH2-containing fragments were also detected, although to a much lesser extent. Despite the difference, the data of Muhlberg et al.(19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) appear to be also compatible with model 3, which they did not propose. Otherwise, the mechanisms underlying the tetramer formation of DVLP and dynamin may be slightly different from each other, because, unlike dynamin (18Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26707-26714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Muhlberg A.B. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. EMBO. J. 1997; 16: 6676-6683Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), no dimeric intermediates of DVLP were observed in the cross-linking experiments (Fig. 4)."

In both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, endocytosis is essential for uptake of nutrients, down-regulation of cell surface receptors, and maintenance of cell homeostasis (1Basu S.K. J. Biosci. 1984; 6: 535-542Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 2Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 3Wileman T. Harding C. Stahl P. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Among the protozoans, endocytosis has been widely studied in trypanosomatids likeTrypanosoma and Leishmania (4Overath P. Stierhof Y.D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Coppens I. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Baudhuin P. J.

These hemoflagellates are found predominantly in the blood stream and tissues of mammalian host, where they rapidly multiply. Receptor systems have been identified on trypanosomatid parasites, which mediate uptake of low density lipoprotein and transferrin presumably for efficient supply of nutrients required for rapid growth such as cholesterol and metal ions, which usually occur as tightly bound complexes with carrier proteins (7Ouaissi M.A. Cornette J. Capron A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 19: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Bastin P. Stephan A. Raper J. Saint-Remy J.M. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Leishmania sp. are protozoan parasites responsible for several diseases varying from a single cutaneous lesion to fatal visceral leishmaniasis, affecting millions of people worldwide (9Marsden P.D. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1984; 6: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Leishmania donovani is the etiologic agent of kala-azar, a chronic and often fatal form of human visceral leishmaniasis (10Chang K.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1983; 14: 267-302Google Scholar). In common with most trypanosomatids, Leishmania lack a complete heme biosynthetic pathway and must therefore acquire heme from external sources (11Chang K.P. Trager W. Science. 1974; 183: 531-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Chang K.P. Chang C.S. Sassa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2979-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Chang C.H. Chang K.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the animal host, heme is present mainly as hemopexin and hemoglobin of which hemoglobin is the most important reservoir (14Bezkorovainy A. Bullen J.J. Griffiths E. Iron and Infection : Molecular, Physiological and Clinical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, New York1987: 27-67Google Scholar). This potential source may be available when erythrocytes are lysed by hemolysins or natural degradation of hemoglobin in macrophages or by hitherto unknown mechanisms. Galbraithet al. (15Galbraith R.A. McElrath M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 29: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of specific heme-binding sites on Leishmania mexicana amazonensispromastigotes. Since Leishmania promastigotes can also be grown in vitro in blood agar medium without addition of heme (16Lwoff M. Lwoff A. Biochemistry and Physiology of Protozoa. Academic Press, New York1951: 131-182Google Scholar), it is possible that Leishmania might have evolved mechanisms to internalize intact hemoglobin and generate heme intracellularly. Hemoglobin-binding proteins have been identified in some pathogens, suggesting that selective recognition of hemoglobin occurred at the cell surface (17Fujimura S. Shibata Y. Hirai K. Nakamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2339-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rosenthal P.J. Meshnick S.R Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka W.T.H.

However, no specific hemoglobin-binding site has so far been reported to be present onLeishmania. In the present investigation, we have shown that a limited number of sites localized in the flagellar pocket of L. donovanipromastigotes mediate uptake and degradation of hemoglobin with saturation kinetics. Furthermore, we also report the presence of a 46-kDa protein on the cell surface of L. donovanipromastigotes that specifically binds hemoglobin. Hemoglobin, hemin, globin, transferrin, hemocyanin, myoglobin, colloidal gold particles, rabbit anti-hemoglobin antibodies, and hemoglobin-agarose affinity matrix were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 20-nm colloidal gold was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA.N-Hydroxysuccinimido-biotin, avidin-horseradish peroxidase (avidin-HRP), 1The abbreviations used are: HRP, horseradish peroxidase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and bicinchoninic acid reagents were purchased from Pierce. Anti-hemoglobin antibody in mice was raised by standard technique (22Overkamp D. Mohammed A.S. Cartledge C. London J. J. Immunol. 1988; 9: 51-68Google Scholar). FITC-labeled horse anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Other reagents used were of analytical grade. Promastigotes of L. donovani (UR 6) were obtained from the Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Calcutta, India. The cells were routinely maintained on solid blood agar slants containing glucose, peptone, sodium chloride, beef heart extract, and rabbit blood with gentamycin (23Roy J.C. Ind. J. Med. Res. 1932; 20: 355-367Google Scholar, 24Chaudhuri G. Chatterjee T.K. Banerjee A.B. Ind. J. Med. Res. 1982; 76: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar). For experimental purposes, cells were harvested from 3-day-old blood agar slants by scraping into phosphate-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.2) saline (0.15m). Hemoglobin was labeled with Na125I by the iodine monochloride-catalyzed reaction (2Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). More than 98% of the radioactivity was acid precipitable, and the specific activity varied between 100 and 200 cpm/ng of hemoglobin from batch to batch. Promastigotes were suspended in RPMI medium and washed three times with the same media. Cells (5 × 107) were resuspended in RPMI containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated at 4 °C with varying concentrations of 125I-hemoglobin. After 4 h, the cells were washed three times with PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA and then three times with PBS to remove unbound radioactivity. The cell pellet was finally dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH. The cell-associated radioactivity was then measured by placing an aliquot in a γ counter. Cellular protein content was estimated by bicinchoninic acid reagent (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Greke N.M. Olson B.L. Klinth D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18635) Google Scholar). The results were expressed as femtomoles of hemoglobin bound/μg of cell protein. To determine the specificity, binding of125I-hemoglobin (6 μg/ml) with promastigotes was carried out in the presence of different competitors as indicated. Cells (5 × 107) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-hemoglobin in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C. After 3 h the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 10 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were processed for the determination of trichloroacetic acid-soluble non-iodide radioactivity after extraction with chloroform (2Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatographic analysis showed that about 80% of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released into the medium consisted of monoiodotyrosines. The cells were washed as indicated in the binding experiment, and an aliquot was measured to determine the cell-associated radioactivity. Leishmania cells (5 × 105) were incubated with 6 μg/ml hemoglobin for 2 h at 4 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound hemoglobin and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.2, for 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in LR White resin. Ultrathin sections of the LR White-embedded cells were blocked overnight with 2.5% casein in 0.001% Tween 20 in PBS. Sections were washed five times with PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with rabbit anti-hemoglobin antibody (1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were washed five times in similar manner (5 min each time), and they were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with 20-nm colloidal gold (1:10) for 1 h at 37 °C to allow the detection of primary antibody binding. Finally, the sections were stained with uranyl acetate and viewed at 80 kV in a transmission electron microscope (Joel 1200 EX 11). Cells without hemoglobin bound was used as control. To determine the intracellular location of hemoglobin inside theLeishmania, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with gold particles (20 nm) conjugated with hemoglobin (1 μg of hemoglobin/ml) as described by De Mey (26De Mey J. Polak J.M. Van Noorden S. Immunochemistry: Modern Methods and Application. Wright, Bristol, United Kingdom1986: 115-145Google Scholar) for 1 h at 25 °C or at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA. The cells were washed five times with cold PBS to remove unbound gold and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, washed, and treated with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 msodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.3. The cells were rinsed and dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in araldite (27Busson S. Ovtracht L. Gounon P. Biol. Cell. 1989; 67: 37-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thin sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined at 60 kV with an electron microscope. BSA-gold was used as control. Finally, quantitation was carried out by counting the number of gold particles internalized by Leishmania for each set of experimental conditions. L. donovani promastigotes (5 × 107) were washed three times with PBS, incubated with 5 μg/ml hemoglobin for 2 h at 4 °C, washed, and incubated for different periods at 37 °C to allow internalization of the hemoglobin bound at 4 °C. Finally, the cells were washed and processed as described for the binding experiment. Cells were resuspended in PBS, and thin smears of cells were prepared on glass slides. Subsequently, the cells were fixed in precooled (–20 °C) methanol for 20 min (28Osborn M. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, New York1994: 347-354Google Scholar). After fixation, cells were washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 with 5 min of incubation at room temperature each time. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-hemoglobin primary antibody in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the cells three times with PBS (5 min/each), they were incubated with horse anti-mouse FITC in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C to allow the detection of primary antibody binding. Cells were then washed once with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and three times with PBS (5 min/each). The slides were then mounted in glycerol containing para-phenylenediamine and viewed in a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Cell surface proteins of intact L. donovani promastigotes were biotinylated using standard procedure (29Zurzolo C. Bivic A.L. Boulan E.R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 185-192Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and incubated with 500 μg/ml N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed three times with PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl to remove excess biotin, followed by one wash with PBS. Biotinylated L. donovani promastigotes were washed three times in PBS and then kept for 1 h at 4 °C in hypotonic Tris-HCl buffer (5 mm, pH 7.2). Then, the cells were broken by sonication (3 × 20 s) and the unbroken cells and nucleus were separated by low speed centrifugation (200 × g for 10 min.). The resultant postnuclear supernatant was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was treated with PBS containing 2% β-octyl glucoside and kept at 4 °C overnight. Finally, extracted membrane proteins were separated from the debris by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant thus obtained contained biotinylated membrane proteins. The extract (100 μl) containing biotinylated membrane proteins (0.6 mg) was added to hemoglobin-agarose beads (100 μl of packed gel containing 1.6 mg of hemoglobin) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 m NaCl in a microcentrifuge tube and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with the same buffer to remove the proteins bound nonspecifically with the affinity matrix. Subsequently, 30 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elctrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) was added to the washed beads and kept in a boiling water bath at 100 °C for 5 min. The sample was allowed to cool, and then the affinity beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube, and 20 μl of the sample was subsequently applied to a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Finally, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and Western blot analysis was carried out to detect the biotinylated surface proteins ofLeishmania using avidin-HRP and developed by α-chloronaphthol. The data presented in Fig. 1 a show the amount of 125I-hemoglobin binding at 4 °C to the cells as a function of the concentration of 125I-hemoglobin in the incubation medium. Half-maximal binding of125I-hemoglobin occurred at a concentration of about 0.09 μm hemoglobin (6 μg/ml). Scatchard plot (30Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17803) Google Scholar) of the data in Fig. 1 a exhibited a straight line (K d = 0.25 μm). The number of hemoglobin binding sites per promastigote was found to be 1.2 × 105. The binding of 125I-hemoglobin toLeishmania was effectively inhibited by unlabeled hemoglobin (Fig. 1 b) with 50% inhibition achieved at about 0.09 μm (6 μg/ml) hemoglobin. When cells were incubated with 0.09 μm (6 μg/ml) of 125I-hemoglobin at 4 °C along with 10-fold excess of hemocyanin, transferrin, hemin, globin, and myoglobin, the binding of 125I-hemoglobin was not affected (Fig. 2), indicating the specificity of these binding sites for hemoglobin.Figure 2Effect of various compounds on the binding of125I-hemoglobin at 4 °C. Promastigotes (5 × 107/ml) were incubated with 0.09 μm labeled hemoglobin in the absence or presence of 10-fold excess of the indicated compounds at 4 °C for 4 h. Data, expressed as percentage of hemoglobin bound by the cells in the absence of any competitor (100% bound), represent an average of three determinations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When promastigotes were incubated with different concentrations of 125I-hemoglobin at 37 °C for 3 h, cell-associated radioactivity increased in a saturable fashion while a part of the added radioactivity was released into the medium as trichloroacetic acid-soluble material (Fig.3 a). The half-maximal value for uptake and degradation was achieved at about 0.065 μmhemoglobin. The data in Fig. 3 b show, that when the promastigotes were incubated with varying concentrations of125I-hemoglobin at the optimal growth temperature of 25°C, the content of cell-associated radioactivity reached saturation with a half-maximal value of 0.06 μmindicating expression of hemoglobin-binding sites of similar affinity and number as at 37 °C. The amount of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity released in the medium, however, was about one-fifth of that at 37 °C. These results indicate that, even at 25 °C,Leishmania takes up hemoglobin and then degrades it, albeit to a lesser extent than at 37 °C. When Leishmaniapromastigotes were incubated with 125I-hemoglobin (0.09 μm) at 37 °C for different time periods, cellular radioactivity reached a steady state plateau within 30 min while trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity continued to increase at a linear rate (Fig. 4), indicating the simultaneous uptake and degradation of 125I-hemoglobin.Figure 4Time course of uptake and degradation of125I-hemoglobin at 37 °C. Promastigotes (5 × 107/ml) were incubated with 0.09 μm125I-hemoglobin at 37 °C. After indicated time intervals, cell-associated radioactivity and trichloroacetic acid-soluble non-iodide products of125I-hemoglobin degradation released in the medium were determined. Data represent an average of three determinations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Uptake of 125I-hemoglobin at 37 °C was inhibited by unlabeled hemoglobin, whereas globin and hemin did not significantly inhibit the uptake of hemoglobin, indicating that the binding sites recognized hemoglobin as a whole (Fig.5 a). Unlabeled hemoglobin, but not globin, competed for the degradation of 125I-hemoglobin (Fig. 5 b). Surprisingly, about 80% of the125I-hemoglobin degradation was inhibited by 45 μm hemin (Fig. 5 b). We also noted that hemin (15 μm) inhibited the scavenger receptor-mediated degradation of maleylated bovine serum albumin in a macrophage cell line (data not shown). In contrast, hemoglobin degradation byLeishmania could not be inhibited by lysosomotropic agents chloroquine, monensin, or ammonium chloride (data not shown), which are potent inhibitors of lysosomal degradative processes in mammalian cells. WhenLeishmania previously incubated with hemoglobin at 4 °C were treated with a rabbit anti-hemoglobin antibody followed by an anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with colloidal gold, accumulation of gold particles could be seen in the flagellar pocket (Fig.6, b and e). In contrast, no gold particles were detected in the cells not incubated with hemoglobin (Fig. 6, a and d) or anti-hemoglobin antibody (Fig. 6, c and f). To explore the fate of hemoglobin bound with high affinity to the sites in the flagellar pocket, we incubated the Leishmania with hemoglobin-gold for 1 h either at 37 °C (Fig.7, a and b) or at 25 °C (Fig. 7, c and d) and localized the gold particles by electron microscopy. The results presented in Fig. 7(a and c) show that the gold particles are localized in discrete intracellular vesicles, suggesting the internalization of hemoglobin at both temperatures. This result also indicated that transport of hemoglobin in Leishmania is mediated through vesicle fusion. The uptake of hemoglobin-gold particles was inhibited by incubating the cells with free hemoglobin in similar condition at both temperatures (Fig. 7, b andd), suggesting that uptake is mediated through specific binding sites as evidenced in the biochemical assay. In order to quantitate the uptake of hemoglobin-gold by Leishmania, we counted the number of gold particles internalized by 50 cells. The data in Table I show thatLeishmania internalized about 371 gold particles in discrete vesicular structures when the cells were incubated at 37 °C with hemoglobin-gold. In contrast, only 86 particles were detected when theLeishmania were incubated with the same concentration of hemoglobin-gold in presence of excess unlabeled hemoglobin. The uptake of BSA-gold, presumably through nonspecific fluid phase endocytosis, was about 10% of that of hemoglobin-gold. Similar results were also obtained when the same experiments were carried out at 25 °C (TableI).Table IQuantitation of hemoglobin-gold uptake by L. donovaniAdditionTemperatureNo. of gold particles1-aNumber of gold particles present in 50Leishmania.°CHb-gold37371Hb-gold + Hb3786Hb-gold25124Hb-gold + Hb2531BSA-gold37381-a Number of gold particles present in 50Leishmania. Open table in a new tab To follow the kinetics of hemoglobin uptake, after binding hemoglobin at 4 °C the washed cells were incubated for different periods of time at 37 °C, treated with anti-hemoglobin antibodies, and visualized by subsequent probing with secondary antibodies labeled with FITC. Immediately after binding at 4 °C hemoglobin was visualized as a bright fluorescent spot (Fig.8 a) in the apical region ofLeishmania. After warming to 37 °C, progressive dispersal of the staining pattern began by 2 min, and by 15 min the fluorescence dispersed throughout the cell body (Fig. 8 d). In order to identify the putative hemoglobin-binding sites, surface membrane fractions prepared from intact biotinylated promastigotes were solubilized with detergent and subjected to affinity chromatography on hemoglobin-agarose beads. The proteins from theLeishmania surface membranes bound to hemoglobin-agarose affinity matrix were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the biotinylated proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using avidin-HRP, which revealed a single band with a molecular mass of 46 kDa (Fig.9, Control). Preincubation of the membrane preparation with hemoglobin effectively blocked the adsorption of the 46-kDa protein to hemoglobin-agarose beads, as can be seen by the reduced intensity of the band in the middle lane. In contrast, preincubation with hemin did not affect the binding of the protein to hemoglobin-agarose (last lane). Therefore, the 46-kDa band is likely to be the putative hemoglobin-binding protein on Leishmaniasurface. Our study demonstrates absorptive endocytosis of hemoglobin byL. donovani promastigotes in vitro. At 4 °C125I-hemoglobin binds to Leishmania in a saturable manner, indicating that it is recognized by a limited number of binding sites on the cell surface (Fig. 1 a). The binding sites recognize hemoglobin as a whole, which was evident from the fact that, although unlabeled hemoglobin effectively competed for the binding of 125I-hemoglobin, free hemin and globin (Figs. 1 b and 2), as well as the heme-containing α and β chains of hemoglobin (data not shown) did not inhibit the binding. The exquisite specificity of these binding sites for the particular conformation of intact hemoglobin molecule is further highlighted by the fact that hemoglobin binding toLeishmania is not inhibited by myoglobin. Binding of hemoglobin was also not competed by hemocyanin (protein containing copper-tetrapyrrole) or transferrin (Fig. 2). At higher temperatures (25 °C or 37 °C), hemoglobin is internalized and degraded up to the monoiodotyrosine level (Fig. 3,a and b). Uptake of hemoglobin at 37 °C reached a steady state within 60 min, while the degradation continued to show a linear rise, indicating simultaneous uptake and degradation of hemoglobin by the parasite (Fig. 4). Hemin and globin did not show any significant competition for uptake (Fig. 5 a). Globin also did not compete for degradation of hemoglobin, but hemin caused substantial inhibition of hemoglobin degradation (Fig. 5 b). It is possible that hemin-mediated impairment of hemoglobin degradation in Leishmania might act as a feedback mechanism precluding intracellular accumulation of excessive heme. Three lines of evidence suggest that after initial binding with cell surface receptor hemoglobin is internalized by Leishmania.1) Electron microscopic studies showed that at 4 °C hemoglobin bound to specific sites located in the flagellar pocket ofLeishmania (Fig. 6, b and e), whereas at 37 °C the hemoglobin was found distributed throughout the cell. After initial binding with the sites localized in the flagellar pocket at 4 °C, hemoglobin was rapidly internalized by the cells as shown by the fluorescence microscopic studies (Fig. 8). When the cells were warmed for only 2 min, most of the hemoglobin was detected inside the cell presumably in the early endosome-like compartments (Fig.8 b). After 5 min, hemoglobin was detected in discrete intracellular vesicles (Fig. 8 c) and was eventually dispersed throughout the cell body by 15 min (Fig. 8 d). 2) When the cells were incubated with hemoglobin-gold at 37 °C or 25 °C for 1 h, gold particles were found to be localized in discrete intracellular vesicles throughout the cell body (Fig. 7,a and c). Competition of hemoglobin-gold uptake by free hemoglobin indicated the specificity of hemoglobin endocytosis (Fig. 7, b and d; Table I). 3) Biotinylated hemoglobin bound by Leishmania at 4 °C could be detected in endocytic vesicles isolated after short incubation of the cells at 37 °°C (data not shown). These results suggest that, after high affinity binding with specific sites on the cell surface, hemoglobin is internalized through a vesicular transport pathway. In contrast to mammalian cells, endocytosis occurs in the trypanosomatid parasites through the flagellar pocket, although the exact nature of these compartments is not known (4Overath P. Stierhof Y.D. Wiese M. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 27-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown that, after binding to specific receptors localized in the flagellar pocket, rapid endocytosis of macromolecular nutrients such as low density lipoprotein or transferrin occurs in trypanosomatid parasites. We have demonstrated that the hemoglobin-binding sites inLeishmania located in the flagellar pocket mediate rapid endocytosis of bound hemoglobin. Transferrin receptor is known to be recycled in mammalian cells (31Huebers H.A. Finch C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1987; 67: 520-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been demonstrated in Trypanosoma that both transferrin receptor along with the ligand are targeted to a lysosome-like compartment (32Steverding D. Stierhof Y.D. Fuchs H. Tauber R. Overath P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1173-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our data showing degradation of 125I-hemoglobin to trichloroacetic acid-soluble material primarily to the level of monoiodotyrosines are also consistent with existence of such a degradative compartment inLeishmania. The insensitivity of hemoglobin degradation byLeishmania to potent inhibitors of lysosomal degradative processes in mammalian cells chloroquine, monensin, or ammonium chloride (33Ohkuma S. Poole B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3327-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar, 34Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) remains to be explained, but could presumably be related to the relatively higher pH values (≥ 6) of endolysosomal compartments in protozoan parasites (35Brickman M.J. Cook J.M. Balber A.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3611-3621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine the nature of the intracellular compartments to establish the pathway of hemoglobin transport inside the cell. It would also be interesting to determine whether the intracellular transport of hemoglobin is regulated by vesicle fusion. Actually, in some of the micrographs, we were able to detect dumbbell-shaped vesicles containing gold particles, indicating the possible fusion of different intracellular compartments (Fig. 7 a). However, further work would be needed to establish the nature of the compartments and the mechanism of the fusion. A single biotinylated protein of 46 kDa was revealed when solubilized membranes from surface biotinylated intact Leishmaniaadsorbed by hemoglobin-agarose beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with avidin-HRP (Fig. 9). This further confirms that the hemoglobin-binding protein is present on the Leishmaniamembrane, as only cell surface proteins would be biotinylated under the conditions employed (29Zurzolo C. Bivic A.L. Boulan E.R. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 185-192Google Scholar). Furthermore, preincubation of the membrane fraction with hemoglobin could compete this band out, suggesting the hemoglobin-binding specificity of the 46-kDa protein. Preincubation with hemin did not result in any competition, indicating that the hemoglobin-binding protein on the Leishmania membrane does not interact with hemin. Thus, in the present investigation, we have shown that hemoglobin binds with high affinity through specific binding sites located in the flagellar pocket of Leishmania. The binding of hemoglobin with Leishmania surface membrane is mediated through a putative receptor protein of apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. After high affinity binding with cell surface receptor, hemoglobin is rapidly internalized into discrete intracellular compartments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the existence of a vesicular pathway for transport of hemoglobin inLeishmania. It will be interesting to determine the mechanism of hemoglobin trafficking inside the Leishmaniaand the role of Rab-like GTPases in this transport. Further studies are in progress to determine the role of signal transduction intermediates in the mechanism of hemoglobin transport. We thank Dr. S. N. Upadhyay for support in carrying out electron microscopy studies and Dr. A. C. Banerjea, Dr. S. Rath, and Dr. C. M. Gupta for critically reviewing the manuscript."

The stable and efficient maintenance of low-copy plasmids within bacterial cells is ensured, in part, by addiction mechanisms mediated by specific proteins (1Jensen R.B. Gerdes K. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 2Yarmolinsky M.B. Science. 1995; 267: 836-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For example, when bacteriophage P1 lysogenizes Escherichia coli as a low copy plasmid, the rate of spontaneous plasmid loss is only about one per 105generations (3Rosner J.L. Virology. 1972; 49: 679-680Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Two proteins comprise the plasmid addiction system of bacteriophage P1: Doc (death oncure), a 126-residue toxic protein, and Phd (prevent host death), a 73-residue antidote (4Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This system functions to kill cells that have been cured of the plasmid. The addiction mechanism depends on significant differences in the proteolytic stability of Doc, which is resistant to proteolysis, and Phd, which is degraded in a manner dependent on the host-encoded ClpXP protease complex (5Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In P1 lysogens, a concentration of Phd sufficient to suppress Doc toxicity is maintained by a continuous synthesis of Phd molecules de novo. In a bacterial cell that has lost the P1 genome, existing Phd is degraded and because there is no further synthesis of new Phd, levels fall, and the cytoplasmically inherited Doc kills the P1-free daughter cells. Post-segregational killing of plasmid-cured cells is also used by other low-copy number plasmids, including the F (6Loh S.M. Cram D.S. Skurray R.A.

In each case studied, a long-lived toxin and short-lived antidote are part of the addiction mechanism. Interestingly, a functionally similar two-protein module is encoded by the mazE and mazF genes of E. coli(10Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), which are regulated by the cellular level of ppGpp, an indicator of amino acid starvation. Functional homologues of the Phd and Doc proteins are also found upstream of the Ecoprrl type IC DNA restriction and modification operon (11Tyndall C. Lehnherr H. Sandmeier U. Kulik E. Bickle T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 729-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results suggest that addiction system homologues may function in the response to starvation and DNA restriction. The Phd and Doc genes are expressed from the same operon (4Lehnherr H. Maguin E. Jafri S. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and Phd negatively regulates its own expression as well as that of Doc (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), ensuring a relatively low level of expression of both proteins in P1 lysogens. The DNA site bound by Phd is 23 base pairs in length and includes two 10-base pair subsites that are roughly palindromic and separated by 3 base pairs (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (see Sequence 1). In footprinting experiments, Phd occupies the left operator subsite at roughly 10-fold lower concentrations than the right subsite (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

In this work, we characterize the secondary structure and thermal stability of the purified Phd protein, study the effect of operator DNA binding on the stability of Phd, and determine the stoichiometry, mechanism, and cooperativity of Phd binding to the intact operator DNA and to operator subsites. The results are discussed in the context of the plasmid addiction mechanism. Phd shows some functional and sequence similarities to Arc, MetJ, and other members of the ribbon-helix-helix family of DNA-binding proteins (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored frozen at −80 °C prior to purification. The cells were thawed at 4 °C, resuspended in buffer A (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) with 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and lysed by sonication. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, followed by a 0.22-μm filtration. The supernatant was applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A, and proteins were eluted with a gradient from 50 to 1000 mmNaCl. A peak that included Phd eluted at approximately 400 mm NaCl. This peak was applied to a reverse-phase semipreparative C18 column (Vydac) and was resolved by using a 0–80% acetonitrile gradient in water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. At this point, Phd was greater than 95% pure as assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry performed using a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Workstation confirmed the molecular mass expected for purified Phd with no modifications (8128 daltons). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained by using an AVIV 60DS spectrapolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled sample holder and a 10-mm path length cuvette. Mean residue ellipticity, [θ], was calculated as, [θ]=[100×θ×m]/[c×L]Equation 1 where θ is the observed ellipticity, mis the mean residue weight, c is the concentration in mg/ml, and L is the path length in centimeters. The concentration of Phd was determined by measuring tyrosine absorbance both at pH 7 and in 0.1 m KOH using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. Protein concentrations were calculated by using extinction coefficients of 1394 m−1cm−1 (274 nm at pH 7) and 2377m−1 cm−1 (294 nm in 0.1m KOH) for the single tyrosine of Phd. For thermal denaturation experiments, samples in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA were equilibrated at each temperature for 1 min, and the CD ellipticity at 222 nm was averaged for 2 min. Experiments were performed at protein concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 μm. Melting curves were fit to a two-state transition between native and denatured protein by nonlinear least squares fitting using the program NONLIN for Macintosh (15Brenstein R.J. NONLIN for Macintosh. Robelko Software, Carbondale, IL1989Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of Phd to its operator DNA site and to DNA subsites was monitored by a polyacrylamide gel mobility shift assay as described (16Fried M.G. Crothers D.M.

The second DNA strand was than annealed by mixing equimolar amounts of the complementary oligonucleotides, heating to 90 °C, and cooling slowly.

Serial dilutions of the Phd protein were added to the labeled DNA, and the mixtures were incubated for at least 2 h. After this time, glycerol was added to each sample (to a final concentration of 5%), and the samples were loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 250 V in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA). The gel-mobility assays were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and IMAGEQUANT software. To determine the molar ratio of Phd bound to its palindromic DNA subsites, increasing amounts of Phd were added to 1 μm left subsite DNA in binding buffer and incubated for 2 h. The concentration of DNA and protein in this experiment was much higher than the Phd-DNA dissociation constant, to ensure a nearly complete binding of the protein to the DNA. A small amount (∼1 nm) of radiolabeled DNA was also added to quantify the ratio of bound to unbound DNA, following electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel at 250 V in TBE buffer. Phd was purified to homogeneity as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 1 A shows the CD spectra of Phd at 4 °C and 37 °C, and also at 37 °C in buffer plus trimethylamine N-oxide, an osmolyte that stabilizes native structure (19Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The amount of secondary structure was estimated from the CD spectrum (20Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 21Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). At 37 °C in buffer alone, Phd seems to be in a largely unfolded, random-coil conformation. However, at 4 °C or at 37 °C in the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, Phd has a CD spectra indicative of a folded protein containing approximately 45% α-helix (Fig. 1 A). Denaturation experiments monitored by CD were performed to determine the thermal stability of Phd (Fig. 1 B). The thermal denaturation of Phd is cooperative, with a T m of about 25 °C. As expected, Phd is predominantly unfolded at 37 °C. Superimposible denaturation curves were observed at Phd concentrations of 1 and 15 μm, suggesting that the native form of Phd is stable as a monomer (Fig. 1 B). The thermal denaturation of Phd was fully reversible in a reverse melt, indicating that the protein can readily alternate between its folded and unfolded states. To study the effect of DNA binding on Phd structure, increasing amounts of a 32-bp oligomer containing the phd operator site were added to a solution containing Phd, and CD spectra were taken (Fig.2 A). DNA binding induces a dose-dependent increase in Phd structure, suggesting that the folding and site-specific DNA binding of Phd are coupled. The ellipticity at 228 nm (a wavelength at which B-DNA does not contribute to the CD signal, see Fig. 2 B) is plotted as a function of DNA concentration in Fig. 2 C. The slope of the initial part of the titration curve shows that the amount of operator DNA needed for induction of fully folded Phd is roughly one-quarter of the protein concentration, suggesting that Phd binds to its operator DNA as a tetramer.

Biol. 1987; 195: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) was added as a control, no increase in the CD signal of Phd at 228 nm was observed over the range of DNA concentrations tested (Fig. 2 C). Thermal denaturation of Phd was performed in the presence of increasing amounts of the phd operator (Fig.3). The T m of Phd increases as a function of the concentration of operator DNA (Fig.3 B), demonstrating stabilization of the native Phd structure by DNA binding. No significant change in the T m of Phd was observed when nonspecific DNA was added at concentrations up to 500 nm. To determine the oligomeric form of Phd that binds to an operator subsite, increasing amounts of Phd were added to a 1 μm solution of left subsite DNA, and binding was assayed by a gel-mobility-shift assay (Fig. 4 A). A single bound complex was observed. At the DNA concentration used for this experiment, almost all of the added Phd becomes DNA-bound (see below), and the stoichiometry of binding can be calculated from the slope of the rising portion of the titration curve (Fig. 4 B). In the experiment shown, this slope is 0.52, indicating that Phd binds to an operator subsite as a dimer. This value is consistent with the finding that four molecules of Phd are stabilized by binding to the intact operator, which contains two subsites. Because Phd in solution is an equilibrium mixture of folded and unfolded monomers, the subsite DNA binding reaction involves both folding and dimerization of the protein. Fig.5, A and B, show a gel-mobility-shift assay of Phd binding to DNA fragments containing the left and the right operator subsites, respectively. The assays were performed using a DNA concentration low enough (∼10 pm) to allow the reaction mechanism to be deduced from the dependence of binding on Phd concentration and an equilibrium dissociation constant to be calculated. Two observations suggest that two Phd monomers bind cooperatively to subsite DNA. First, only free DNA and the dimer-bound species are observed as populated species; no intermediate band corresponding to a 1:1 complex is evident in the gel-mobility-shift assay (Fig. 5, A and B). Second, a Scatchard plot of the binding data is concave downward as expected for a reaction displaying positive cooperativity (Fig. 5 C). Fits of this binding data reveal that subsite DNA binding shows an approximate second-order dependence on Phd concentration as expected for the model, 2P+S⇔P2SKd=[P]2[S]/[P2S] MODEL1where P represents a mixture of folded and unfolded Phd monomers and S represents subsite DNA. At half-maximal binding,K d = [P]2 or about 6·10−16m2 for the left subsite and 1·10−14m2 for the right subsite binding experiments shown in Fig. 5. Gel-mobility-shift assays were also used to assay Phd binding to the intact operator site (Fig. 6). In these experiments, both Phd dimer-bound and tetramer-bound DNA species are observed in the gel. The dimer-bound species are observed at lower Phd concentrations than the tetramer-bound species but continue to persist as populated intermediates as the Phd concentration is raised. Moreover, binding to the full-site DNA is observed over the same general range of Phd concentrations as binding to the left subsite DNA (compare Figs. 5 A and 6 A). Both of these observations suggest that there is little, if any, mutual stabilization between Phd dimers bound at adjacent operator subsites. Indeed, the full-site binding curve can be fit by independent binding of Phd to the isolated left and right operator subsites (Fig. 6 B). Using the gel-mobility-shift assay, we attempted to measure the dissociation kinetics of complexes of Phd with the left operator subsite and with intact operator DNA. In both cases, however, dissociation was complete by the first time point. These experiments allow us to place an upper limit of approximately 10 s on the half-live of these Phd-DNA complexes. In the studies reported here, the Phd protein of the plasmid addiction module of phage P1 was purified to homogeneity and assays probing structural stability and DNA binding were performed. Phd has the CD spectrum of a predominantly denatured protein at 37 °C, and only folds at this temperature when bound to operator DNA, or when stabilized by high concentrations of osmolytes. In its native state, Phd has a CD spectrum of a protein that is roughly 45% α-helical. Because denatured proteins are generally subject to proteolytic destruction in E. coli (23Parsell D.A. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7590-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems likely that the thermal instability of free Phd contributes to its degradation in the cell (5Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In a cell containing the phage P1 genome, free Phd should be unfolded and sensitive to degradation, whereas operator-bound Phd should be folded and less susceptible to degradation. Moreover, the continual synthesis of new Phd maintains sufficient steady-state levels of Phd to inhibit the toxicity of Doc. In a cell that has lost the P1 genome, there is no operator to bind, new Phd synthesis cannot occur, and the degradation of free Phd eventually leads to Doc-mediated cell death (5Lehnherr H. Yarmolinsky M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3274-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The phd operator overlaps the promoter for Phd and Doc transcription, and Phd represses this operon and its own synthesis (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This ensures that when Phd levels in a P1 lysogen fall too low, transcription is derepressed and new synthesis of Phd can occur. Our studies show that two Phd monomers bind cooperatively to each left and right operator subsite. As a consequence, operator occupancy changes as a function of the second power of the Phd concentration, and the system is quite responsive to moderate changes in steady-state Phd levels. For example, a 5-fold drop in Phd concentration would cause a 25-fold increase in the ratio of free to bound operator. Although binding of Phd to operator occurs in the 10 nm range, the half-life of the protein-DNA complex appears to be less than 10 s. Such a rapid dissociation rate might ensure a dynamic system capable of responding rapidly to sudden decreases in Phd levels. If the half-life of the Phd-operator complex were too long, a precipitous drop in Phd levels might result in Doc toxicity before transcription could be derepressed to permit new synthesis. Phd shares some sequence similarities with the phage P22 Arc repressor and additional members of the ribbon-helix-helix family of transcription factors and also has a DNA recognition site whose overall size and organization is similar to the operators of many of these ribbon-helix-helix proteins (12Magnuson R. Lehnherr H. Mukhopadhyay G. Yarmolinsky M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18705-18710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Some of the findings here extend these similarities. For example, Phd binds to each operator subsite as a dimer and to the intact operator as a tetramer in a fashion analogous to Arc repressor (24Brown B.M. Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11189-11195Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Raumann B.E. Rould M.A. Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Nature. 1994; 367: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, our studies show that Phd differs, in one very important way, from Arc and its relatives. The intertwined nature of the native Arc dimer permits folding only as a dimer and dissociation of Arc dimers leads to denaturation (25Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phd, by contrast, is capable of folding as a monomer. This difference between Phd and Arc indicates that the native folds of these two proteins must be significantly different. Another difference between Arc and Phd involves the presence or absence of dimer-dimer cooperativity in binding to their respective intact operators. Phd dimers bound to adjacent operator subsites do not appear to be mutually stabilizing and still dissociate rapidly, whereas Arc dimers bind in a highly cooperative fashion and stabilize a complex with a half-life in excess of 1 h (26Brown B.M. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As discussed above, however, the short half-life of the Phd-operator complex may be functionally important in allowing rapid transcriptional responses to decreases in Phd concentration. The P1 plasmid addiction system raises a number of intriguing physiological issues about mechanism and bacterial cell death and also provides a model system to study the interplay of protein folding, protein degradation, protein-protein interactions, and protein-DNA interactions. The studies reported here should provide a basis for future biochemical, biophysical, and structural studies of many of these issues.

We report a kinetic analysis of the rat kidney high-affinity peptide transporter PepT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. By use of simultaneous radioactive uptake and current measurements under voltage-clamp condition, the charge to substrate uptake ratio was found to be close to 2 for both d-Phe-l-Ala andd-Phe-l-Glu, indicating that the H+:substrate stoichiometry is 2:1 and 3:1 for neutral and anionic dipeptides, respectively. The higher stoichiometry for anionic peptides suggests that they are transported in the protonated form. Ford-Phe-l-Lys, the charge:uptake ratio averaged 2.4 from pooled experiments, suggesting that Phe-Lys crosses the membrane via PepT2 either in its deprotonated (neutral) or its positively charged form, averaging a H+:Phe-Lys stoichiometry of 1.4:1. These findings led to the overall conclusion that PepT2 couples transport of one peptide molecule to two H+. This is in contrast to the low-affinity transporter PepT1 that couples transport of one peptide to one H+. Quinapril inhibited PepT2-mediated currents in presence or in absence of external substrates. Oocytes expressing PepT2 exhibited quinapril-sensitive outward currents. In the absence of external substrate, a quinapril-sensitive proton inward current (proton leak) was also observed which, together with the observed pH-dependent PepT2-specific presteady-state currents (I pss), indicates that at least one H+ binds to the transporter prior to substrate. PepT2 exhibited I pss in response to hyperpolarization at pH 6.5–8.0. However, contrary to previous observations on various transporters, 1) no significant currents were observed corresponding to voltage jumps returning from hyperpolarization, and 2) at reduced extracellular pH, no significant I pss were observed in either direction. Together with observed lower substrate affinities and decreased PepT2-mediated currents at hyperpolarizedV m, our data are consistent with the concept that hyperpolarization exerts inactivation effects on the transporter which are enhanced by low pH.

In kidney and intestine, enzymatic degradation of proteins and peptides produces oligopeptides that are absorbed across the brush-border membrane of epithelial cells, followed by breakdown into free amino acids (1Ganapathy V.

(Lond .). 1997; 504: 169-174Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the H+:peptide stoichiometry is still controversial (6Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol.

In the present study, we report novel characteristics of the rat PepT2 demonstrated by neutral, anionic, and cationic substrates under various conditions, using the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. We simultaneously measured the radiolabeled peptide uptakes and the PepT2-mediated currents under voltage-clamp conditions in order to determine the H+:substrate stoichiometry. We also demonstrated quinapril-sensitive PepT2-mediated outward currents, a proton leak, and pH-dependent presteady-state currents (I pss). A kidney cortex λgt10 cDNA library was screened using a 0.52-kb PepT2 probe generated by specific PCR primers. The complete PepT2 sequence was isolated and subcloned into PTLN2 plasmid. Sequence analysis of both strands confirmed a 100% identity to the published PepT2 sequence (GenBankTM accession number D63149, Ref. 21Saito H. Terada T. Okuda M. Sasaki S. Inui K. Biochim. Biophys.

Capped cRNA of rat PepT2 was synthesized by in vitro transcription from cDNAs in PTLN2 and injected (with 15–25 ng) into oocytes. The same volumes of H2O were injected as the control. The two-microelectrode voltage-clamp experiments were performed using a commercial amplifier (Clampator One, model CA-1B, Dagan Co., Minneapolis, MN) and the pCLAMP software (Version 6, Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). In experiments involving voltage jumps, currents or membrane potentials were recorded by digitizing at 150 μs/sample and by the Bessel filtering at 10 kHz. When recording currents at a holding potential, digitization at 0.5 s/sample and filtering at 20 Hz were used. Control solutions used for extracellular perfusion contained (in mm): NaCl, 100; HEPES, 10; MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 2.5; Tris base 2.5; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; pH 5.0–8.0 by N-methyl-d-glucamine or HEPES. After 3∼5 min of membrane potential stabilization following microelectrode impalements, the oocyte was clamped to the holding potential (V h) of −50 mV. 100-ms voltage pulses of between −160 and +60 mV, in increments of +20 mV, were then applied, and steady-state currents were obtained as the average values in the interval from 80 to 95 ms after the initiation of the voltage pulses. Substrate-evoked currents and uptake of [4-3H-d-Phe]-Ala, [4-3H-d-Phe]-Glu, or [4-3H-d-Phe]-Lys were simultaneously measured under voltage-clamp conditions, according to a method similar to the one described previously (23Chen X.-Z.

The radioactive phenylalanyl-dipeptides were synthesized by Zeneca Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Northwich, Cheshire, United Kingdom) and dissolved in 10% aqueous ethanol. The specific radioactivity is 12 Ci/mmol, and the concentration is 1 μCi/μl (or 83.3 μm) for all three peptides. The unlabeled Phe-Glu and Phe-Lys were synthesized as described previously (24Lister N. Sykes A.P. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A. Bronk J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1995; 484: 173-182Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and other peptides were purchased from Sigma. The control solution or HEPES-rich solution (in mm: NaCl, 70; HEPES, 60; MES, 2.5; KCl, 2; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; pH 5.5–6.5 by N-methyl-d-glucamine) was used for external perfusion. The uptake solution consisted of the control or HEPES-rich solution plus cold (0.5, 0.5, or 1 mm of Phe-Ala, Phe-Glu, or Phe-Lys, respectively) and hot substrate (1.33, 1.33, or 2.67 μl of radiolabeled Phe-Ala, Phe-Glu, or Phe-Lys, respectively, in 200 μl of solution). The hot substrates contained in the uptake solutions represented only 0.11% of the total substrates. Before starting tracer uptakes, oocyte was clamped at −80 mV and perfused with substrate-free solution. Then the perfusion was stopped, and the uptake solution (200 μl) was added manually using a pipettor, which washed out the substrate-free solution. The uptake lasted 5 min in the chamber whose volume is about 200 μl and terminated by perfusing (washing) the oocyte with the substrate-free solution. Experimental results were expressed in the form of mean ± S.E. (n), wheren indicates the number of oocytes obtained from at least two different donors. The curve-fitting procedures were performed using the SigmaPlot program (Version 4, Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA), and each fitted parameter is expressed in the form parameter ± S.E., where S.E. represents the standard error in the fitting estimates. PepT2 mediates the high-affinity transport of most di- and tripeptides at physiological membrane potentials (V m) but not at hyperpolarizedV m (Fig. 1,A and B). Apparent affinities for both glycyl-dipeptides (Gly-Glu, Gly-Leu, Gly-Lys) andd-phenylalanyl-dipeptides (Phe-Glu, Phe-Ala, Phe-Lys) were strongly voltage-dependent and decreased about 10-fold when hyperpolarizing from −50 to −160 mV (TableI and Fig. 1 B). Although affinities differ largely according to the charge status of glycyl-dipeptides, the maximal currents for glycyl-dipeptides remain approximately the same in the whole voltage range (Fig. 1 C). High concentrations of glycyl-dipeptides evoked currents that did not saturate by hyperpolarization, while modest or low concentrations of these substrates did saturate (Fig.2 A). In contrast, saturation at hyperpolarization was observed for phenylalanyl-dipeptides, even at high concentrations (Fig. 2 B), presumably due to relatively low substrate affinity (Table I). Depending on pH, substrate type, and substrate concentration, PepT2 may exhibit decreases in current with hyperpolarization (Fig. 2) due to low affinities for substrates. The affinities for cationic peptides are relatively low compared with those for anionic and neutral peptides, in analogy to PepT1 (25Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R.

The proton affinities were determined at various membrane potentials using glycyl-dipeptide concentrations approximately equal to five times that of their K m values. Substrate-evoked currents generally increase with an increase in [H+], which is consistent with a proton-driven transport. However, as alluded to above, currents evoked by low substrate concentrations (especially those evoked by cationic substrates) decreased with increasing [H+] and hyperpolarization (Fig. 2, D andE). The affinities for proton at V m = −50 mV were determined when data were fitted to the Hill Equation. The apparent affinity constants were 2.8 ± 0.5 (n = 6), 0.7 ± 0.1 (n = 3), and 0.5 ± 0.1 μm (n = 5) (corresponding to pH 5.5, 6.1, and 6.3) for Gly-Glu, Gly-Leu, and Gly-Lys, respectively. The Hill coefficients were 1.06 ± 0.03, 1.27 ± 0.09, and 1.44 ± 0.06, correspondingly. This appears to suggest the coupling of a single proton ion to Gly-Glu and more than one proton ion to Gly-Leu and Gly-Lys. However, Hill coefficients obtained at otherV m were significantly different, indicating that this method is not accurate for stoichiometry evaluation. In addition, since currents at low pH experienced decreases at hyperpolarizedV m (see Fig. 2 F, at −100 mV), they no longer obey the Michaelis-Menten or the Hill relationships. Thus, it is inaccurate to evaluate stoichiometric ratios based on Hill coefficients. More direct approaches are necessary to determine the H+:substrate stoichiometry. The proton:substrate coupling ratio (stoichiometry) can be accurately determined when the proton and substrate fluxes mediated by PepT2 are measured under the same conditions. Simultaneous monitoring of transporter-specific currents and radioactive substrate uptakes from the same oocyte under voltage-clamp conditions is one of the few approaches proven to be accurate. Voltage-clamp condition is critical to monitor the PepT2-specific currents, because background currents (before substrate addition) change due to depolarization that is elicited by substrate addition. We observed that, during the uptake period, substrate-elicited currents significantly decreased after reaching initial peak values (Fig.3, A–C), which poses the question of whether these decreases interfere with stoichiometry determination. Decreases were less pronounced when the buffer concentration was high (60 versus 10 mm HEPES). For a given buffer concentration, decreases in current were less pronounced when PepT2-specific currents were lower. With similar initial peak currents, Phe-Glu-evoked currents exhibited more decrease than Phe-Ala-evoked currents. We also observed a spike current upon perfusing an oocyte with substrate-free solution after substrate applications. The spikes were significantly higher when the buffer concentration was lower. In the same oocytes, decreases in Gly-Leu-evoked current were also present during continuous perfusion but were accelerated when perfusion was stopped (not shown). These data indicate that decreases in current were partly due to decreased proton concentrations at the immediate proximity of the extracellular membrane. Decreases in current during perfusion may be due to intracellular substrate or H+ accumulation (trans-inhibition), in analogy to observations for other transporters (34Eskandari S. Loo D.D. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27230-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 35Mackenzie B. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 162: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). None of these factors are expected to compromise the accuracy of stoichiometry determination. No significant difference in the charge:uptake ratios were observed when using either control (10 mm HEPES) or HEPES-rich solution (see “Experimental Procedures”). When charge was converted into picomole, the charge to uptake ratios for Phe-Glu, Phe-Ala, and Phe-Lys were determined and averaged 1.91 ± 0.04 (n = 11), 2.16 ± 0.02 (n = 8), and 2.42 ± 0.03 (n = 16), respectively (Fig.3 D). Data obtained using either solution were both plotted in Fig. 3 D. These results indicate that the number of protons cotransported is 3 and 2, respectively, for each anionic and neutral peptide transported. The cotransported proton number per Phe-Lys molecule is 1.4, which is significantly larger than 1, suggesting the possibility that Phe-Lys is transported either under the deprotonated (neutral) form (60%) or under the positively charged form (40%). Quinapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, was found to inhibit the PepT2-mediated currents in oocytes expressing PepT2 (Fig.4, A, B, andD) but had no effects on control oocytes. The inhibition was demonstrated to be noncompetitive with an IC50 close to 1 mm by an independent study (data from our laboratory). 2Zhu, T., Chen, X.-Z., Hediger, M. A., and Smith, D. E., manuscript in preparation. Both inward and outward currents were inhibited (Fig. 4, A–C), indicating that there exists a reversed transport mode. In the absence of external substrates, an inward quinapril-sensitive proton current (proton leak) was observed in oocytes expressing the rat PepT2 (Fig. 4, Dand E). Similar uncoupled leak currents exist in several other transporters (see Refs. 23Chen X.-Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Eskandari S. Loo D.D. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 73: 2503-2510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that no currents were elicited by substrate addition at high pH (see Fig. 2, C–E), our data demonstrates that H+ binds to PepT2 prior to the substrate. Quinapril-sensitive proton leaks exhibited similar decreases with hyperpolarization compared with currents evoked by low external substrate concentrations, indicating that this is a characteristic property of PepT2. By applying voltage jumps from −50 mV to hyperpolarized potentials, PepT2 exhibited pH-dependent presteady-state currents (I pss) (Fig. 5). At pH 5.0–6.0, no significant or low I pss were observed in the whole voltage range tested. The PepT2-specific charge displacement (Q, obtained by eliminating the capacitative component) at pH 7.0 did not saturate up to −160 mV (see Fig.5 E). Since Q at pH 6.0 saturated by hyperpolarization, it is obvious from the figure that the maximal charge displacement (Q max) at pH 6.0 represents less than 15% of the value at pH 7.0. Surprisingly, at the tested pHo range (5.0–8.0), no significantI pss were observed for the off-responses (returning from test potentials V m toV h) (see examples in Fig. 5, A–C) and I pss at pH 6.0 recovered by addition of substrate (Fig. 5 D; steady-state currents were subtracted). These abnormal behaviors of PepT2 are not readily accounted for by previously described kinetic models (see “Discussion”). Between −160 and −80 mV, relaxation time constants (τ) ofI pss for the on-responses ranged from 10 to 40 ms. With external alkalization, the V m corresponding to the maximal τ shifted to more negative values (Fig.5 F), similar to other transporters such as PepT1 (9Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and SGLT1 (27Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2544-2552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At more depolarized potentials, τ could not be evaluated due to small I pss. τ was only slightly affected by intracellular acidification using a previously reported approach (9Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (not shown), in contrast to τ of PepT1 that showed large responses (9Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using biophysical approaches, we have revealed unique kinetic properties of rat PepT2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These include the stoichiometries for different types of substrates determined under voltage-clamp conditions, the proton leak, and the reversed transport mode as well as presteady-state currents. The number of proton ions (“n”) necessary for cotransporting one substrate molecule (stoichiometry “n”) determines the concentration of intracellular substrate that cells can keep at equilibrium. A high H+:substrate ratio allows maintenance of high intracellular substrate concentrations but also requires a relatively large amount of H+ electrochemical energy. Earlier studies on isolated intestinal tissue preparations and the Caco-2 cell line derived a H+:peptide ratio of greater than 2:1 based on measurements of short circuit currents and peptide fluxes (5Thwaites D.T. McEwan G.T. Hirst B.H. Simmons N.L. Pfluegers Arch. 1993; 425: 178-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Abe M. Hoshi T. Tajima A. J. Physiol.

More recently, our laboratory used current and tracer measurements to study the stoichiometry of PepT1 for neutral and charged peptides (25Steel A. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Boyd C.A.R. Hediger M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1997; 498: 563-569Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed 1:1, 2:1, and 1:1 ratios for neutral, anionic, and cationic peptides, respectively. Studies of the high-affinity peptide transporter using rat kidney brush-border membrane vesicles (6Daniel H. Morse E.L. Adibi S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19917-19924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and oocytes expressing rabbit renal PepT2 (10Amasheh S. Wenzel U. Weber W.M. Clauss W. Daniel H. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1997; 504: 169-174Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 13Daniel H. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 154: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) revealed a Hill coefficient (n H) close to 1 for charged and neutral peptides, suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, using brush-border membrane vesicles of rat kidney cortex, Temple et al. (20Temple C.S. Bronk J.R. Bailey P.D. Boyd C.A. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 430: 825-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found an H close to 1 and 2 for neutral and anionic dipeptides, respectively, and suggested a stoichiometry of 1:1 and 2:1, correspondingly. Since n H value may depend on the substrate concentration and binding cooperativity of different protons in case of coupling to multiple protons,n H is usually not equal to the actual stoichiometric ratio. Protons are also known to have multiple effects on membrane proteins as well as on substrates (30Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975: 884-925Google Scholar). The evaluation ofn H necessitates experiments to be performed over a wide pH range. However, proteins and/or substrates might not have the same activity in the whole range, which would significantly influence the profile of current versus proton concentration ([H+]). Although in epithelial cells PepT2 is in contact with a luminal unstirred layer, which has a pH ranging between 5.5 and 6.0 (31Nussberger S. Hediger M.A. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 211-218PubMed Google Scholar), and proton affinity constants of PepT2 are around pH 6.0 (see “Results”), PepT2-mediated currents decreased when pHo approached 5.0–6.5 (Fig. 2). This means that PepT2 currents no longer obey the Michaelis-Menten or Hill relationships. Our results from simultaneous measurements of radiolabeled peptide uptakes and PepT2-mediated currents under voltage-clamp condition show that the charge:uptake ratios are close to 2 for both anionic and neutral substrates. These data indicate that PepT2 possesses two H+- and one substrate-binding sites. In the case of anionic substrates, one additional proton is needed, most likely for substrate protonation before or during binding. Because of the hydrophobic environment provided by the membrane and the transporter, the charges that the loaded transporter is permitted to carry within the membrane should be well controlled and relatively constant (+2 for neutral and anionic dipeptides). In the case of cationic substrates (S+) such as Gly-Lys and Phe-Lys, the charges on the loaded transporter (2H+ and 1S+) are +3, and the cotransport might be unfavorable. The lysine residue under physiological pH range (pH 5.0–8.5) predominantly carries one positive charge. However, PepT2 protein might help in deprotonating (neutralizing) the lysine residue even at external physiological pH and, thereby, transport the resulting neutral form of dipeptide by coupling to two protons. This process is apparently equivalent to the stoichiometry of 1H+:1S+ and corresponds to carried charges of +2. Observed charge:Phe-Lys ratio of 2.4 is consistent with the interpretation that both cationic and neutral forms of Phe-Lys are transported. The former (2H+:1S+) accounts for 40% and the latter (1H+:1S+) accounts for 60% of observed Phy-Lys-evoked currents. However, neither of these two coupling mechanisms satisfies both the 2:1 H+:substrate stoichiometry requirement and the 2:1 charge:substrate ratio requirement, which may explain observed significantly lower affinities for cationic substrates compared with neutral or anionic substrates. The characteristics of high stoichiometry and overall high affinity of PepT2 as compared with PepT1 are consistent with its S3 localization in the kidney (32Smith D.E. Pavlova A. Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. Yang T. Huang Y.G. Schnermann J.B. Pharmacol. Res. 1998; 15: 1244-1249Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), where PepT2 can efficiently reabsorb peptides using higher electrochemical energy of protons. In contrast, the 1:1 stoichiometry and low affinity of PepT1 allow economic and efficient substrate absorption in the intestine and early parts of renal proximal tubules. As required by the principle of microscopic reversibility, reversed transport must occur provided that substrates are available in the intracellular side of the membrane. Usually, forward and reversed transports are not symmetrical in terms of substrate/ion affinity. Transport by SGLT1 exhibits a strong inward rectification in both cotransport and Na-leak modes, as revealed using the cut-open oocyte technique (33Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2405-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Reversed transport has been demonstrated by using transporter-specific inhibitors in oocytes expressing SGLT1 (by phlorizin, Ref. 33Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Jackson F. Berteloot A. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2405-2414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), EAAC1 (by kainate, Ref. 38Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and SDCT1 (by phloretin, Ref. 23Chen X.-Z. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tian W. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20972-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), etc. Reversed transport depends on the availability of sufficient levels of substrates inside the oocyte. However, no significant levels of dipeptides were observed inXenopus oocytes (39Nussberger S. Foret F. Hebert S.C. Karger B.L. Hediger M.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 998-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as they are efficiently digested by intracellular peptidases. The observed quinapril-inhibitable outward currents of PepT2 might originate either from reversed cotransport of unknown PepT2 substrates or from proton-leak current. Transporters and channels possess charged residues within the membrane which, in response to voltage changes (jumps) applied across the membrane, move (or relax) to new equilibrium positions, thus generating electrical signals (i.e. currents). These currents vanish when the new equilibrium (steady state) is reached and are therefore called presteady-state currents (I pss). Binding/dissociation of coupling ions or substrates are often voltage-dependent and contribute to the observedI pss. Characterization of these currents provides unique information on properties of membrane transporters. We propose a kinetic model to help understanding how PepT2I pss are associated with conformational changes from one steady state to another (Fig.6). For simplicity, the model was drawn with ordered binding and mirror symmetry, in analogy to models proposed for PepT1 (9Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At low external driving-ion concentrations and in the absence of external substrate, the transporter should be predominantly inward facing (states I′ to IV′, Fig. 6). I pss elicited under these (or similar) conditions have been interpreted as being associated with conformational changes of the unloaded transporter from the inward-faced to the outward-faced configurations (27Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2544-2552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Conversely, when [H+]o is high, previous kinetic models predict that the transporter is predominantly outward facing (states II and III) and that voltage jumps to depolarized V mgenerate positive I pss. However, these predictions were not applicable to PepT2 (see below), even though they were extensively verified in a number of transporters such as rat PepT1 (9Nussberger S. Steel A. Trotti D. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), human PepT1 (29Mackenzie B. Loo D.D.F. Fei Y.-J. Liu W. Ganapathy V. Leibach F.H. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5430-5437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and SGLT1 (27Chen X.-Z. Coady M.J. Lapointe J.-Y. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2544-2552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The reported models for these transporters also predict that 1) the maximal charge displacement (Q max) is independent of driving-ion concentration provided that the driving ion is still present and 2) the charge movement associated with the on-response fromV h to a test potential V m(Q on) is equal to that corresponding to the off-response from V m to V h(Q off), consistent with strict charge conservation. As alluded to above, these predictions are not applicable to PepT2. First, Q max was greatly reduced at low pHo (Fig. 5 E). Second, in contrast toQ on, Q off (from hyperpolarized V m to V h of −50 mV) was negligible at any pHo tested. Third, in contrast to previous observations that the presence of external substrate diminishes or eliminates I pss (see SGLT1, Ref.36Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U . S . A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar; the Na+-iodide transporter, Ref. 34Eskandari S. Loo D.D. Dai G. Levy O. Wright E.M. Carrasco N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7777-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), PepT2-specific I pss were increased by substrate addition at low pHo (Fig. 5 D). Finally, when the time interval separating two consecutive voltage jumps (V h = −50 mV) was reduced from 650 to 200 or 50 ms, I pss were largely reduced after the first jump (to −160 mV), whereas there was no significant reduction inI pss when using time intervals of 650 ms or longer (not shown). These observations indicate that hyperpolarization results in transporter inactivation, which can be reversed by depolarization (−50 mV) during a 650-ms period. Hyperpolarization appears to have inactivation effects on steady-state properties as well. At low pHo, hyperpolarization resulted in decreases in substrate-evoked current (Fig. 2), substrate affinity (Table I and Fig.1 B), and proton leak (Fig. 4 E). External substrate appears to prevent the transporter from being inactivated by hyperpolarization, as we can see from increases inI pss by substrate addition (Fig. 5 D) and from increases in maximal steady-state currents evoked by saturating substrate concentrations (Fig. 1 C). Mechanisms underlying such a hyperpolarization-stimulated inactivation are still unclear. Although PepT2 possesses considerable sequence homology to PepT1 (∼50% identity), our findings revealed profound differences in several aspects such as stoichiometry, substrate affinity, effects of hyperpolarization, and presteady-state properties. While PepT1 was shown to exhibit remarkable symmetry with respect to the effects of intra- and extracellular pH on I pss, more studies are needed to elucidate corresponding effects of pH on PepT2. It remains to be seen whether binding of an additional proton in PepT2 is the origin of some of these differences. We are grateful to Dr. Donald W. Hilgemann for valuable discussions and suggestions on the manuscript and to Dr. Ji-Bin Peng for valuable discussions and technical assistance.

Studies on the effect of CPG16 on transcription have revealed that it may be involved in the down-regulation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) activity.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using 2.5 μg/ml DNA. After 10% Me2SO shock, cells were cultured in normal growth media and maintained in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method using 5 μg of DNA (7Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After the transfection, the cells were cultured in normal growth media and maintained in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Control and HA-cpg16-transfected COS-7 cells in 6-cm tissue culture plates were starved for 16 h in 0.1% FCS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then treated with either 10 μm forskolin (Sigma), 10 μm8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP, Sigma), 10% FCS, or other stimuli for various times. If isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma, 10 μm) was included in an experiment, it was added 5 min before other treatments. After stimulation, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed (10 min on ice) in Buffer H (50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin-A (8Seger R.

The supernatant containing HA-CPG16 was collected and incubated with 2 μg of anti-HA antibody (4 °C) for 1 h, then precipitated with protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 1 h. The complexes were washed (4 °C) three times with PBS + 0.1% Nonidet P-40, once with 0.5 mLiCl in PBS, and twice with buffer A ((50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmNa3VO4 (8Seger R.

GST-CPG16 or HA-CPG16 autophosphorylation was performed at 30 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 20 μm ATP (20 cpm/fmol), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm orthovanadate in a final volume of 30 μl. The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. In vitrokinase assays were performed using the same reaction mixture with the following substrates or protein kinases. Recombinant Jun N-terminal kinase, recombinant external-signal responsive kinase (ERK), recombinant p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), recombinant MAPK/ERK kinase, and recombinant ΔN-EE-MAPK/ERK kinase were prepared as described (7Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Activated ERK was prepared by phosphorylation with active MAPK/ERK kinase (7Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Nuclear K-7 was the kind gift from Dr. K. Bomsztyk, University of Washington, Seattle. Purified vitronectin and PKA (catalytic subunit) were gifts from Dr. S. Shaltiel, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel (WIS). GST-Jun 1–74 and GST-ATF2 16–96 as well as GST-Rho and GST-ARF were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (10Levi N.L. Hanoch T. Benard O. Rozenblat M. Harris D. Reiss N. Naor Z. Seger R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 815-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAP2 was a gift from Dr. Z. Eleazar (WIS). Peptides based on the following sequences were synthesized by the biological services at the WIS: epidermal growth factor receptor 661–675, glycogen synthase kinase 6–20, Jun 60–78, and Far1 134–150. Myosin light chain, histone IIIs, myelin basic protein (MBP), β-casein, and protamine were purchased from Sigma. 32P-Labeled proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P; Millipore Corp.). Membrane slices containing the proteins were hydrolyzed in constant boiling 5.7 n HCl and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described (11Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method using 5 μg of DNA. After transfection, the cells were replated on glass coverslips contained in a 6-well tissue culture dish and allowed to grow for 36 h after which the cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.1% calf serum for 16 h. Cells were activated with the appropriate compounds and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After one wash with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The primary monoclonal antibody, anti-HA antibody (antibody unit, WIS) was applied to the cells at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS for 45 min, washed with PBS, and incubated again with lissamine rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) 1:200 in PBS for 45 min. After washing with PBS, coverslips were mounted, analyzed, and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot camera. The assay was performed as described by Spengler et al. (12Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Briefly, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing a stable luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of the CRE element were transfected by electroporation with an expression vector (1 μg) containing HA-cpg16. Six h after transfection, serum was removed from the cells, and after a total of 24 h, stimulants were added. Four h after stimulation, the medium was discarded, and the cells were washed with PBS. The cells were then lysed by adding luciferase lysis buffer (Labsystems, Inc.). Cell extracts were transferred to the luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.), and luciferase activity was recorded. The resulting data were analyzed using Excel software (Microsoft Corp.). cpg16 was recently identified (2Hevroni D. Rattner A. Bundman M. Lederfein D. Gbarah A. Mangelus M. Silverman M.A. Kedar H. Naor C. Kornuc M. Hanoch T. Seger R. Theill L.E. Nedivi E. Richter-Levin G. Citri Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in a differential cDNA screen from kainate-stimulated rat hippocampus dentate gyrus. We performed Northern blot analysis of poly(A)-selected mRNA from total rat brain, rat dentate gyrus, kainate-activated rat dentate gyrus, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney with a 32P-labeled probe of the 1600-base pair cDNA of cpg16 as described above. Hybridization was found in the rat brain and rat dentate gyrus, with strong up-regulation of the cpg16 message after treatment with kainic acid. In most of the other tissues examined, no expression of cpg16 was detected, although a weak signal could be seen in the kidney (Fig. 1). Because a similar (but not identical) sequence was recently detected in a mouse skin library, the expression of this gene may not be limited to the brain, and it could play a role in additional tissues. The predicted open reading frame of cpg16 encodes a putative protein of approximately 50 kDa. Based on sequence homology, the primary structure of CPG16 predicted a protein serine/threonine kinase containing all 15 characteristic amino acids of these kinases (13Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 3-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To determine whether CPG16 is indeed a 50-kDa functional protein kinase and to characterize its enzymatic properties, cpg16 was fused in-frame with cDNA of GST, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione beads. Coomassie Blue staining of the purified preparation revealed one main protein at 75 kDa (Fig.2), which corresponded to the expected molecular mass for the GST-CPG16 fusion protein. Another band that could be detected in the purified fraction at the molecular mass of 27 kDa is probably the GST protein alone. In the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, the purified GST fusion underwent autophosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, indicating that the cpg16 cDNA indeed encodes for a functional kinase (Fig. 2). A lower molecular weight band (35 kDa) that was detected upon autophosphorylation most likely represents a degradation product of the GST-CPG16 itself, as judged by its increase when protease inhibitors were omitted from the bacterial extraction buffer in the course of purification (data not shown). To allow for studies of CPG16 in mammalian cells, the cDNA ofcpg16 was inserted into a mammalian expression vector containing an HA tag. The HA-cpg16 was transfected into COS7 cells followed by starvation of the cells, lysis, and immunoprecipitation of the HA-containing proteins. One band was detected when the purified preparation was subjected to Western blot analysis with the anti-HA antibody (52 kDa, Fig.3 A), which corresponded to the expected molecular mass of CPG16 fused to HA. Because a band with an identical molecular mass was autophosphorylated upon incubation of the purified proteins with ATP, the identified band is most likely the autophosphorylated HA-CPG16. CPG16 with both HA and GST tags showed low (8 nmol/min/mg) autophosphorylation activity. For a clue regarding a possible physiological substrate(s) for CPG16, we performed an in vitro substrate specificity assay in which we tested a group of peptides, proteins, and cytosolic extracts for their ability to be phosphorylated by CPG16. Using Mg2+ and ATP as cofactors, CPG16 appeared to have a restricted specificity, as it showed activity only toward MBP at a low rate of 12 nmol/min/mg (Table I and Fig. 3). This specificity of CPG16 was most apparent when denatured brain extract, which contains thousands of proteins, was used as a substrate. In most of the experiments performed, CPG16 failed to phosphorylate any of the proteins in the tested preparation (Fig. 3), although in some of the experiments a phosphorylated 45-kDa band could be detected upon phosphorylation with CPG16 (data not shown). Phosphoamino analysis of the autophosphorylated GST-CPG16 and of CPG16-phosphorylated MBP revealed that the phosphorylation occurred only on serine and threonine (Fig. 3 B). This is consistent with the predicted protein serine/threonine kinase sequence of cpg16 (2Hevroni D. Rattner A. Bundman M. Lederfein D. Gbarah A. Mangelus M. Silverman M.A. Kedar H. Naor C. Kornuc M.

Interestingly, CaMKII was shown to be a key player in hippocampal plasticity (14Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 15Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mainly by affecting the transcription factor CREB (16Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Ca2+ and calmodulin are capable of modulating the autophosphorylation activity of CPG16. We found that neither Ca2+ and calmodulin nor the CaM kinase inhibitors EGTA, calmidazolium, and W7 had any effect on the autophosphorylation of the bacterially expressed GST-CPG16 (Fig. 4and data not shown). Similarly, there was no effect of Ca2+or calmodulin on GST-CPG16 activity toward any of the substrates examined in in vitro phosphorylation assays (data not shown). Moreover, when the sequence of cpg16 was aligned with the sequence of CaMKII, the calmodulin binding region of CaMKII differed from the corresponding region in CPG16 and predicted a cryptic calmodulin-binding site. Indeed, GST-CPG16 did not bind to a calmodulin-agarose column under any condition tested (data not shown), strongly suggesting that CPG16 is not dependent on Ca2+ or calmodulin for its direct enzymatic activity. Because the activity of many protein serine/threonine kinases can be increased in response to extracellular agents, we undertook to determine whether the low basal activity of CPG16 can be modulated by any extracellular stimuli. Thus, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with HA-CPG16, serum-starved, and treated with agents that activate intracellular signaling pathways. HA-CPG16 was then immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies and subjected to in vitro kinase assays. Interestingly, both forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP agents, which increase the intracellular levels of cAMP, caused a substantial transient activation of CPG16. Specifically, HA-CPG16 purified from forskolin-treated cells exhibited a 6–8-fold increase in its autophosphorylation activity, which peaked at 30 min after treatment and decreased again to basal levels within 60–90 min after stimulation (Fig.5). 8-Br-cAMP and dibutyryl cAMP yielded similar results (Fig. 5 and data not shown), although the time course of activation in response to 8-Br-cAMP was somewhat slower and peaked at around 45 min after treatment. The addition of isobutylmethylxanthine to inhibit phosphodiesterases and further increase cAMP had only a small effect on the kinetics of the phosphorylation of HA-CPG16. Other extracellular agents that were used to identify stimulators or activators of HA-CPG16 included the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, the protein kinase C activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, epidermal growth factor, and FCS. All these compounds are known to activate several downstream signaling pathways including MAPK cascades and others but had no detectable effect on the autophosphorylation activity of CPG16 (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Moreover, even after purification from stimulated cells, there was no increase of CPG16 activity toward any of the in vitro substrates examined besides MBP (data not shown). From the above experiments performed on COS7 cells, it appears that CPG16 is exclusively activated by cAMP-elevating agents, which transmit their signals primarily through the activation of the protein kinase PKA. Therefore, we used the specific PKA inhibitor H89 to examine whether PKA is indeed involved in CPG16 activation. Thus, H89 was added to the examined cells before stimulation by forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP (17Yao H. York R.D. Misra-Press A. Carr D.W. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8240-8247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the autophosphorylation activity of CPG16 was determined as described above. Our results show that H89 significantly inhibited the forskolin stimulation of CPG16 when added to the transfected COS7 cells 15 min before stimulation (Fig. 6). Therefore, these results clearly indicate the involvement of PKA in the activation process of CPG16. We then examined whether CPG16 can be a direct substrate of either PKA or ERK/MAPK that was suspected to phosphorylate a PXSP consensus sequence in the N terminus of CPG16 (18Erickson A.K. Payne D.M. Martino P.A. Rossomando A.J. Shabanowitz J. Weber M.J. Hunt D.F. Sturgill T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19728-19735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar). Although both the catalytic subunit of PKA and activated ERK2 were very active in phosphorylating vitronectin and MBP, respectively, no phosphorylation of purified HA-CPG16 by these kinases could be detected even after a prolonged phosphorylation reaction (Fig.7). Recombinant active MAPK/ERK kinase (7Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and casein kinase II also failed to phosphorylate HA-CPG16 (data not shown), and CPG16 had no apparent effect on all four tested kinases. Therefore, the activation of CPG16 may occur by a cAMP-dependent PKA-induced mechanism (probably a kinase cascade) similar to the activation of phosphorylase kinase downstream of PKA (20Johnson L.N. Barford D. Owen D.J. Noble M.E. Garman E.F. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 11-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain information on the subcellular localization of CPG16, we performed immunolocalization studies in COS7 and in NIH-3T3 cells transiently transfected with HA-cpg16. In both cell types, most of the HA staining was detected in the cytosol, although some enrichment in nuclear staining could be observed after 8-Br-cAMP and forskolin stimulation of the cells (Fig. 8 and data not shown). This nuclear enrichment could not be detected when the cells were stimulated with FCS under conditions in which ERKs are translocated to the nucleus (7Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Although mostly cytosolic, the limited translocation indicated that CPG16 may have a nuclear role upon cAMP elevation. The translocation of CPG16 to the nucleus prompted the notion that it might participate in the regulation of transcription. Because the phosphorylation of CPG16 is affected by cAMP, we tested the possibility that overexpression of CPG16 would influence gene expression through the transcription factor CREB. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells expressing a stable luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of the CRE element were stimulated with various cAMP-elevating agents, and their luciferase reporter activity was determined (12Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H. Journot L. Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). As expected, activation of these cells with forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, epidermal growth factor, and isoproterenol but not calcium ionophore, peroxovanadate, and phorbol ester (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) increased the activity of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig.9). However, when these cells were transfected with a large amount of expression vector containing the cDNA for CPG16 (5 μg/plate), a moderate inhibition compared with the control vector was detected in the luciferase activity (Fig. 9). Lesser amounts of the vector containing the CPG16 did not have a significant effect on this activity. Thus, it is possible that CPG16 participates in the down-regulation of cAMP-induced transcription, although the small amount of inhibition may suggest that this inhibition might be an indirect process. Glutamate receptors produce long term plasticity changes in central nervous system neurons, at least in part by induction of transcription cascades (21Frank D.A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 79: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Nguyen P.V. Abel T. Kandel E.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Glutamate-activated transcription factors induce a first wave of gene expression, the immediate-early gene, many of which encode transcription factors, for example, c-fos (23Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). The immediate-early gene products in turn induce hundreds of downstream genes, many of which are thought to produce plastic changes in brain neurons and therefore are known as candidate plasticity-related genes (CPGs (1Nedivi E. Hevroni D. Naot D. Israeli D. Citri Y. Nature. 1993; 363: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar)). Recently, Hevroni et al. (2Hevroni D. Rattner A. Bundman M. Lederfein D. Gbarah A. Mangelus M. Silverman M.A. Kedar H. Naor C. Kornuc M. Hanoch T. Seger R. Theill L.E. Nedivi E. Richter-Levin G. Citri Y. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 75-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) identified about 400 genes that are either induced or down-regulated upon kainate (glutamate analog) induction. One of the most intriguing genes identified was CPG16, which demonstrated sequence homology with the plasticity-related CaMKII. In this study we tried first to check whether or not CPG16 is indeed a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase. A careful analysis of the C-terminal region of CPG16 revealed that six amino acids essential for calmodulin binding are missing. Indeed, we found that CPG16 failed to bind to a calmodulin-agarose column, indicating that the cryptic site was not sufficient to promote calmodulin binding. Moreover, no effect of Ca2+ or calmodulin on the in vitro or in vivo activity of CPG16 could be detected (Fig. 4). Therefore, our results clearly indicate that CPG16 is regulated by a different mechanism than that involved in the activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated kinases. Although not influenced by calmodulin and Ca2+, a different regulator was identified when COS7 cells were transiently transfected with CPG16. Of several stimuli that were tested for their ability to modulate CPG16 activity immunoprecipitation, cAMP-elevating agents were shown to have a stimulatory effect. Thus, forskolin or 8-Br-cAMP increased CPG16 autophosphorylation activity by about 6–8-fold over its basal activity, whereas other stimuli did not have any effect. The H89 inhibitor, which selectively inhibits PKA activity, abolished the cAMP-dependent stimulation, indicating that CPG16 acts downstream of PKA. However, CPG16 could not be phosphorylated or directly activated by PKA in vitro. Moreover, the activation observed was much smaller than the activation of PKA itself, which under similar conditions may usually reach more than 50-fold. Taken together, these data suggest that CPG16 may be activated by a PKA-induced mechanism that could be a PKA-induced kinase cascade. Activation because of phosphorylation by an intermediate kinase is likely also because of the existence of threonine residue in the activation loop of CPG16 that is analogous to the activation sites of many activated protein kinases such as ERK and MAPK/ERK kinase (8Seger R. Seger D. Reszka A.A. Munar E.S. Eldar-Finkelman H. Dobrowolska G. Jensen A.M. Campbell J.S. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25699-25709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at this stage, the direct mechanism of activation is not clear. The relatively small activation of 6–8-fold could be explained by higher susceptibility to modulating enzymes such as phosphatases. An alternative explanation could be a possible dependence on cofactors or intermediate molecules that may be essential to secure full activation but are not expressed in high quantities in the COS7 cells. It is also possible that the activation toward the real substrate of CPG16 is higher than the activation of its autophosphorylation or activity toward MBP. The involvement of cAMP in neuronal plasticity is well established, and many studies have documented the involvement of this second messenger in the synaptic plasticity of memory and behavior (25Roberson E.D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30436-30441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). cAMP is known to transmit its signals primarily through several PKA isoforms that may function either in the cytosol or translocate to the nucleus and regulate processes there (26Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, the PKAs may regulate metabolic as well as protein synthesis processes (26Brandon E.P. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, the main function of PKA in the nucleus is to regulate the transcription of cAMP-dependent genes, which is mediated primarily by phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB (16Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 1203-1214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In this regard, the induction of CPG16 by kainate and its activation by cAMP may indicate that this kinase is one of the components that participates in plasticity determination. However, unlike overexpression of the catalytic subunit of PKA, the overexpression of CPG16 seems to slightly inhibit the cAMP-stimulated CREB activity. Therefore, unlike the stimulatory effect of PKA, CPG16 is likely to participate in the down-regulation of cAMP signals in the nucleus. Inhibitory processes have been shown in all levels of the PKA cascades, including the down-regulation of receptors by phosphorylation, hydrolysis of cAMP by phosphodiesterases, or phosphorylation/dephosphorylation inhibition of PKA targets. Interestingly, cAMP-regulated protein phosphatase activity has been shown recently to down-regulate CaMKII activity during long-term potentiation (27Blitzer R.D. Connor J.H. Brown G.P. Wong T. Shenolikar S. Iyengar R. Landau E.M. Science. 1998; 280: 1940-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Therefore, CPG16 may participate in the regulation of CREB either by phosphorylating its inhibitory residues or alternatively, via the activation of phosphatases that are involved in the inactivation of CREB. Although the role of CPG16 in the nucleus is intriguing, it should be noted that its localization is primarily cytosolic, and only a small amount of nuclear translocation was observed upon 8-Br-cAMP treatment of cells. Therefore, CPG16 probably phosphorylates and modulates the activity of other downstream targets mainly in the cytosol; however, these targets have yet to be identified. An intriguing clue regarding a possible substrate for CPG16 came from the recent identification of KIAA0369 (28Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Nakajima D. Ohira M. Seki N. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1997; 4: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This cDNA was found to have a high degree of identity to both CPG16 and doublecortin (9des Portes V.

It is therefore possible that CPG16 is involved in the regulation of doublecortin itself or to one of its related proteins; however, more work is needed to confirm this hypothesis. In summary, we have characterized a neuronal plasticity-related protein kinase, CPG16. Although it shows high sequence homology to Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinases, we have found that it is not influenced by Ca2+ or calmodulin but is activated by cAMP-elevating agents. However, CPG16 is not an in vitrosubstrate for PKA, suggesting that it may be activated by a PKA-dependent cascade. CPG16 was also shown to translocate into the nucleus upon stimulation and to have a weak inhibitory effect on cAMP-stimulated transcriptional activity of CREB. Therefore, CPG16 may participate in the down-regulation of cAMP signals toward plasticity-related genes. We thank Drs. Muriel Zohar, Zeev Gechtman, and Elly Nedivi for valuable discussions and comments on the manuscript as well as Tami Hanoch for her skillful technical assistance and Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2041359848,"The last step of tRNA splicing in yeast is catalyzed by Tpt1 protein, which transfers the 2'-phosphate from ligated tRNA to NAD to produce ADP-ribose 1""-2""-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p). Structural and functional TPT1 homologs are found widely in eukaryotes and, surprisingly, also in Escherichia coli, which does not have this class of tRNA splicing. To understand the possible roles of the Tpt1 enzymes as well as the unusual use of NAD, the reaction mechanism of the E. coli homolog KptA was investigated. We show here that KptA protein removes the 2'-phosphate from RNA via an intermediate in which the phosphate is ADP-ribosylated followed by a presumed transesterification to release the RNA and generate Appr>p. The intermediate was characterized by analysis of its components and their linkages, using various labeled substrates and cofactors. Because the yeast and mouse Tpt1 proteins, like KptA protein, can catalyze the conversion of the KptA-generated intermediate to both product and the original substrate, these enzymes likely use the same reaction mechanism. Step 1 of this reaction is strikingly similar to the ADP-ribosylation of proteins catalyzed by a number of bacterial toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2055122464,"Zα is a peptide motif that binds to Z-DNA with high affinity. This motif binds to alternating dC-dG sequences stabilized in the Z-conformation by means of bromination or supercoiling, but not to B-DNA. Zα is part of the N-terminal region of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) , a candidate enzyme for nuclear pre-mRNA editing in mammals. Zα is conserved in ADAR1 from many species; in each case, there is a second similar motif,Zβ, separated from Zα by a more divergent linker. To investigate the structure-function relationship ofZα, its domain structure was studied by limited proteolysis. Proteolytic profiles indicated that Zα is part of a domain, Zab, of 229 amino acids (residues 133–361 in human ADAR1). This domain contains both Zα and Zβas well as a tandem repeat of a 49-amino acid linker module. Prolonged proteolysis revealed a minimal core domain of 77 amino acids (positions 133–209), containing only Zα, which is sufficient to bind left-handed Z-DNA; however, the substrate binding is strikingly different from that of Zab. The second motif, Zβ, retains its structural integrity only in the context of Zab and does not bind Z-DNA as a separate entity. These results suggest that Zαand Zβ act as a single bipartite domain. In the presence of substrate DNA, Zab becomes more resistant to proteases, suggesting that it adopts a more rigid structure when bound to its substrate, possibly with conformational changes in parts of the protein.

Many protein domains that recognize DNA in both sequence- and conformation-specific manners have been characterized (for a review, see Ref. 1Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). These studies have resulted in an understanding of the variety of ways in which protein-DNA interactions can result in function. Identification of a peptide motif, Zα, which binds specifically to Z-DNA, opens up a new vista and invites the investigation of the similarities and differences between domains that bind right- and left-handed DNAs. The conformation specificity ofZα binding has been characterized in many ways. Peptides including this motif bind to alternating dC-dG that has been stabilized in the Z-conformation using bromination or supercoiling, as shown by band shift assays, competition experiments, and BIAcore measurements (2Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.-G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When linked to the nuclease domain from FokI, the resulting chimeric nuclease cuts supercoiled plasmid DNA to bracket a d(C-G)13 in the Z-conformation (3Kim Y.-G. Kim P.S. Herbert A. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12875-12879Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein also binds to short oligonucleotides of suitable sequence and converts them from the B- to the Z-conformation, as detected by CD and Raman spectroscopy (4Berger I. Winston W. Manoharan R.

The binding of Z-DNA by Zα occurs even in the presence of a 105-fold excess of B-DNA (6Herbert A.G. Spitzner J.R. Lowenhaupt K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3339-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Zαbinds poly(dC-dG), stabilized in the Z-conformation by bromination, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) in the lower nanomolar range, as shown by BIAcore measurements (2Herbert A.

Although many properties of Zα have been studied, its biological function in the context of ADAR1 remains unknown. The Z-DNA binding activity of Zα was first identified in proteolytic fragments of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase (ADAR1) (6Herbert A.G. Spitzner J.R. Lowenhaupt K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3339-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and then in the full-length enzyme (7Herbert A. Lowenhaupt K. Spitzner J. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7550-7554Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Zα has been shown to be a conserved feature of human, rat, bovine, chicken, andXenopus ADAR1 (2Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.-G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). A second related motif, Zβ, has been identified in all the ADAR1 enzymes whose sequences are known. These two motifs are separated by a linker region of conserved size; an exception is the human enzyme, in which the linker is twice as long and consists of two nearly identical copies of a module (8Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The presence of a conserved N-terminal region containing these motifs distinguishes ADAR1 from other members of the ADAR family (9Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Higuchi M. Nature. 1996; 379: 460-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Melcher T. Maas S. Herb A. Sprengel R. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31795-31798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and the N terminus has been shown to be differentially expressed (8Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that this region is of importance for the biological function of ADAR1. The ADAR family of enzymes converts adenosine to inosine within double-stranded regions of RNA (11Maas S. Melcher T. Seeburg P.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mRNA, inosine is read as guanosine by the translation apparatus, resulting in codon changes within the synthesized protein. A-to-I editing has been shown to occurin vivo in a number of mRNAs from higher animals (12Verdoorn T.A. Burnashev N. Monyer H. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B.

Nature. 1997; 387: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The best characterized of these, the editing of pre-mRNAs for subunits of the glutamate-gated cation channels in the brain, results in channels with dramatically altered functional properties (19Seeburg P.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNA structures required for ADAR activity are formed by base pairing of an exonic sequence around the editing site with a complementary sequence in the downstream intron; therefore, editing must take place in the nucleus before splicing removes the respective intron(s). It has been proposed that Zα serves to target ADAR1 to its preferred substrates by binding to Z-DNA formed close to actively transcribing genes (20Herbert A. Rich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11595-11598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of Zα, we have characterized the N-terminal region of ADAR1 functionally and structurally. Using human ADAR1 as a model, the classical approach of limited proteolysis was employed to define the boundaries of this domain. Both motifs,Zα and Zβ, together are shown to form a single functional domain, Zab; Zab is stable and protected from proteolysis. Za, containing Zα, but not Zβ, can be regarded as a stable subdomain; this subdomain contributes the main binding activity. There is no equivalent subdomain containingZβ: this region is poorly structured and unstable when isolated. The intervening linker region is unexpectedly well structured, In humans, the second copy of the linker module appears to have a structure similar to the first. Removing one copy of the linker modules reduces the DNA binding affinity, indicating the importance of the distance between the Zα and Zβ motifs. Za binds Z-DNA in a conformationally specific, but not sequence-specific manner. The binding is modified by the presence of the entire Zab domain to confer preference for d(C-G)n over d(C-A)n·d(T-G)n. Different portions of the cloned cDNA coding for human ADAR1 (GenBankTM accession number U10439) were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and inserted into the expression vector pET28a (Novagen), resulting in N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins. In detail, Za131 (residues 96–226), Za77 (133–209), and Zab236 (133–368) were amplified using complementary primers flanked with restriction sites at their termini. Polymerase chain reaction products were analyzed on an agarose gel; bands of the correct size were extracted and subcloned into theNdeI-HindIII sites (Za131 and Za77) or theNheI-HindIII sites (Zab236) of the multiple cloning site of pET28a, resulting in the vectors pZa131, pZa77, and pZa236, respectively. Another construct, ZabΔl, missing one of the two 49-amino acid linker modules separating the Zα andZβ motifs, was created from pZab236 as follows. The 1.1-kilobase SphI-HindIII restriction fragment was digested with the restriction enzyme DrdI, resulting in two cleavage sites at identical locations at nucleotides 789 and 936 (numbers according to GenBankTM accession number U10439). The resulting DNA fragments were deproteinized and precipitated (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After incubation with T4 DNA ligase (25 °C, 4 h), the reaction mixture was analyzed on an agarose gel. The 930-base pair ligation product was isolated and subcloned in the 5-kilobaseSphI-HindIII restriction fragment of pET28a, resulting in the vector pZabΔl. To ensure that the plasmids were correct, they were analyzed by restriction digestion, and the coding regions were sequenced using Sequenase Version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proteins were overproduced in Escherichia coli strain Novablue(DE3) (Novagen). Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.7–0.9A 600 nm units. Cells were harvested after a further 3 h of growth at 37 °C. All subsequent steps were done at 4 °C. The proteins were purified essentially to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions as follows. A cell pellet obtained from a 1-liter culture was resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed using a French press. The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 25,000 × g, and the clear supernatant was separated and incubated with 2 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid metal affinity resin (QIAGEN Inc.) for 1 h. The resin was washed three times with 20 ml of buffer A in a batch and then washed with 40 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) in a column. Overproduced His6-tagged fusion protein was eluted with an imidazole step gradient in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Steps were 30, 50, and 200 mm imidazole, respectively. Fractions were analyzed by denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. on 15 or 18% gels. Fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). After 1 h of dialysis, 15 units of thrombin (Calbiochem) were added to cleave the N-terminal His6 tag. 12 h later, the cleaved protein was dialyzed against buffer E (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mmNaCl, and 2 mm DTT) and finally purified by cation-exchange chromatography on a Mono S HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.05–0.3m) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mmDTT at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, resulting in sharp peak profiles. Za77 eluted at 220 mm NaCl, ZabΔl at 200 mm, and Zab236 at 180 mm. The yield of electrophoretically homogeneous protein was determined using extinction coefficients of 14,000 m−1 cm−1 (Za77 and Za131), 22,400 m−1 cm−1 (ZabΔl), and 28,020 m−1 cm−1 (Zab236) at the absorbance maximum at 278 nm (calculated as described in Ref. 22Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). 8–12 mg of protein were obtained per liter of bacterial culture. Protease digestion was performed by treating 50 μg of protein (0.5 μg/μl) with trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, or Staphylococcus aureus endoproteinase Glu-C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DTT at a protein/protease mass ratio in the range of 50:1 to 1000:1 for various times at 24 °C. Reactions were stopped by heat denaturation at 100 °C for 5 min. To examine the effect of various DNA conformers on Zab digestion, the reaction was performed in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2. DNA was used in a base pair/protein molar ratio of 5:1. Poly[d(5-MeC-G)] was used as substrate DNA, and poly[d(A-G)]·poly[d(C-T)] as unspecific DNA. The digests were separated by SDS-PAGE on 18% gels, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. In the case of protein digested for the experiment shown in Fig. 6 (lanes 10–13), the reactions were stopped by adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) instead of heat inactivation to ensure nondenatured protein. The proteolytic fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE Workstation (PerSeptive) using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight technology. As a matrix, sinapinic acid (10 μg/μl) in acetonitrile/H2O/trifluoroacetic acid (70:29.9:0.1) was used. Alternatively, for fragments smaller than 10-kDa, the matrix was prepared with α-cyanocinnamic acid (10 μg/μl) instead of sinapinic acid. Various fragments were further analyzed by amino-terminal sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Model 475/477A protein sequencer. DNA binding was assayed by native PAGE (23Lane D. Prentki P. Chandler M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 509-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was carried out using d(5-BrC-G)20 as the substrate, which is stable in the left-handed Z-DNA conformation under the applied conditions (24Malfoy B. Rousseau N. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The substrate was end-labeled with 32P and purified by native PAGE prior to the experiment. A reaction mixture of 10 μl containing the ADAR1 fragment (4–500 nm) with <1 pm substrate in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml poly[d(A-G)]·poly[d(C-T)] (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as an unspecific competitor was incubated for 30 min at 24 °C. The mixture was analyzed on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel using 0.5× Tris borate (22.5 mm) as the running buffer. After electrophoresis (10 V/cm, 90 min), the gel was dried and autoradiographed at –70 °C on Kodak X-Omat Blue film with intensifying screens. CD spectra were recorded at 24 °C on an Aviv Model 62DS spectrometer. Conformational change in DNA oligomers was monitored between 235 and 305 nm. DNA samples used were annealed prior to the experiment. For this purpose, a concentrated solution of the self-complementary sequence d(C-G)6 or an equimolar amount of d(C-A)7 and d(T-G)7 was heated to 85 °C for 10 min and then slowly cooled to <20 °C over 1 h. Measurements were carried out in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm DTT using a DNA concentration of 30.0 μmbase pairs and an optical path length of 5 mm. Spectra were recorded in 10-nm steps and averaged over 4 s. Protein was added to the sample from a concentrated stock solution, in aliquots never exceeding 5% of the total volume, and the mixture was equilibrated for 5 min before each measurement. The spectra were corrected for buffer base line and smoothed using software provided by Aviv. Protein spectra were recorded between 190 and 250 nm. Za77 was measured at a concentration of 10.0 μm, and ZabΔl and Zab were measured at 5.0 μm and an optical path length of 1 mm. Spectra were measured in 1-nm steps and averaged over 10 s. For comparisons of the spectra of Zab between 190 and 250 nm in the presence and absence of substrate, poly[d(5-MeC-G)] was used as substrate. A 2:1 base pair/protein molar ratio was used. Protein domains are usually well structured regions of 50–200 amino acids (25Janin C. Chothia C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Schulz G. Schirmer R. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). Larger proteins are built from multiple, mostly independently folded domains. The regions connecting those domains are often flexible and solvent-exposed. Limited proteolysis is a classical approach to define domain organization (27Porter R. Science. 1973; 180: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28Jovin T. Geisler N. Weber K. Nature. 1977; 269: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Roy R. Kumar A. Lee J.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22703-22713Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It takes advantage of the fact that site-specific proteases will cleave proteins preferentially in solvent-exposed unstructured regions, rather than within a folded domain. Limited proteolysis was used to define a structured core containingZα, the Z-DNA-binding motif present in the N-terminal region of ADAR1. Zα has been defined to comprise residues 121–197 of human ADAR1 using functional assays (2Herbert A. Alfken J. Kim Y.-G. Mian I.S. Nishikura K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8421-8426Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, a variety of results from nondenaturing electrophoresis, chromatographic elution, and NMR studies have suggested that the recombinantly produced peptide is not stably folded. 2K. Lowenhaupt and T. Schwartz, unpublished results., 3M. Schade and I. Berger, personal communication. An N- and C-terminally extended portion of the ADAR1 N terminus comprising Gly96–Ser226 was overproduced as a His6-tagged fusion protein in E. coli, and its digestion with four different proteases (endoproteinase Glu-C, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and trypsin) was analyzed. Each of these enzymes has a different sequence specificity; therefore, using them in concert results in complementary information. The use of this combination of proteases results in an even distribution of potential cleavage sites throughout the studied protein, with gaps no longer than 4 residues between adjacent sites. A time course of cleavage with endoproteinase Glu-C is shown in Fig.1 A. An 11-kDa band appeared rapidly and increased in intensity over the observed time; the full-length protein band gradually disappeared over the same period. The intensity of the 11-kDa band was comparable to that of the full-length band, indicating a stoichiometric conversion to a stable product. The cleavage site was mapped to a preferential endoproteinase Glu-C site, C-terminal to Asp132, using N-terminal sequencing. Similar results were obtained using trypsin and chymotrypsin to cleave this protein (data not shown). To ensure that a minimum domain had been identified, the protein was cleaved sequentially with two different proteases. Fig. 1 Bshows the digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C followed by chymotrypsin. Before addition of the second protease, only the 11-kDa band was detectable. Chymotrypsin further truncated the fragment, producing the stable product V8/Ch-8. The N and C termini of these fragments were identified unambiguously using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The V8–11 fragment was shown to contain residues 133–226. Chymotrypsin cut after Trp204; V8/Ch-8 consists of residues 133–204. A similar digestion, carried out with endoproteinase Glu-C and thermolysin, produced a stable product extending from amino acids 133 to 209 (data not shown). Other combinations of enzymes produced consistent results in all cases. From this, we conclude that there is a core domain containing Zα. Trp204 is a potential target for cleavage by both chymotrypsin and thermolysin. Chymotrypsin cut well, but thermolysin cut only marginally at Trp204. Therefore, we define the core domain as comprising Leu133–Gly209. This core was in no case significantly degraded, whereas the regions on either end were rapidly degraded to pieces too small to detect. These results were used to design a stable construct, Za, comprising Leu133–Gly209. This protein was purified fromE. coli undegraded under nondenaturing conditions. Za showed superior chromatographic behavior over previous Zαconstructs, purifying from a Mono S cation-exchange column homogeneously as a sharp peak; this indicated structural uniformity. Samples yielded a single band when analyzed by native PAGE. 4T. Schwartz, unpublished results. When challenged with exogenous proteases, only Za showed striking stability; otherZα constructs were rapidly degraded (data not shown). Both Zα and Zβ are present in every species in which the sequence of ADAR1 is known. The motifs are separated by one or two copies of a module, weakly conserved in sequence, but consistently lacking positively charged residues and 43–49 amino acids in length. 12 residues from this module are an essential part of Za, the stable Zα core domain. It seemed possible that Zα, Zβ, and the linker module(s) together form a single structural and functional unit. To investigate this possibility, we examined the structural organization of a peptide spanning both DNA-binding motifs. This peptide, termed Zab, comprising Leu133 (the previously defined N terminus of Za) to Asn368 (C-terminal to Zβ, from human ADAR1), was soluble when overproduced in E. coli, and full-length protein could be obtained with high yield. These results indicate proper folding with no significant instability. Improper folding often leads to the formation of inclusion bodies inside the overproducing bacterial cell (31Wilkinson D.L. Harrison R.G. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Highly flexible proteins are frequently degraded if expressed in a foreign host (32Makrides S.C. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 512-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the digestion of Zab with four different proteases are shown in Fig. 2. Each enzyme cleaved in a characteristic pattern and produced a small number of very stable bands. Time points were selected to allow the identification of all stable products, using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing where appropriate; minor products were identified wherever possible. In each case, well resolved spectra were recorded. TableI lists the peptides produced by each enzyme, as determined from the molecular mass. For chymotrypsin, trypsin, and endoproteinase Glu-C, the assignments are unambiguous and in good agreement with SDS-PAGE analysis. Minor exceptions are fragments Tr8 and Ch5, which were detected only by mass spectrometry, as discussed below. In the case of thermolysin, it was not possible to unambiguously assign the multiple transitory fragments; however, the major fragments seen after 60 min of digestion could be identified. A schematic diagram of the major transitory products and the stable proteolytic fragments is shown in Fig.3.Table IMass spectroscopic analysis of Zab236 fragmentsProteolytic fragmentMeasured massSequence assignmentCalculated massDaDaV8V2625,650133L . . .

The resulting peptide was very stable to further proteolysis, despite an abundance of potential cleavage sites, including Asp132, which is exquisitely sensitive in the shorter construct used to define Za, as described above. After a long incubation with large amounts of enzyme, additional cleavage occurred at Glu239, Glu301, and Leu307. Glu239 lies within the first 49-amino acid repeat; remarkably, the equivalent site in the second repeat, Glu288, was uncut. Chymotrypsin cleaved the protein after Trp204 and Trp253. These sites are at equivalent positions in the two copies of the tandem repeat. The three generated fragments were stable (Fig. 2 B). The 5-kDa fragment was not visible on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, although it generated a signal in mass spectrometry of comparable intensity to Ch12 and Ch8. Coomassie Blue staining depends largely on positive charges present in the peptide (33Tal M. Silberstein A. Nusser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9976-9980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 49-amino acid repeat contains only 1 positively charged residue. Therefore, we speculated that although Ch5 was resolved on the gel, it was not stained. Two other transitory fragments, Ch18 and Ch*, were separated on the gel. Ch18 could be assigned to be the product of a single cutting site. Ch* could not be unambiguously determined by mass spectrometry. Thermolysin produced similar stable products (Fig. 2 C). Again, symmetrical sites in the repeated linker, Gly209 and Gly258, were cut, resulting in two stable products on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Because thermolysin has low sequence specificity, many transitory products were seen, especially at early time points. Because of these products, it was not possible to unambiguously identify the Tl5 fragment from among several candidates seen by mass spectrometry.

Rho family members containing an arginine residue at position 186 in the C-terminal polybasic region were found to possess a self-stimulatory GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity through homophilic interaction, resulting in significantly enhanced intrinsic GTPase activities. This arginine residue functions effectively as an “arginine finger” in the GTPase activating reaction to confer the catalytic GAP activity but is not essential for the homophilic binding interactions of Rho family proteins.

Thus, specific Rho family GTPases may utilize a built-in arginine finger, in addition to RhoGAPs, for negative regulation. The Rho family small GTPases of the Ras superfamily are molecular switches controlling a variety of intracellular signaling events (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar,2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). To understand how these molecular switches are turned off, much effort has been focused on the elucidation of the mechanism of RhoGAP 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mantGDP, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) GDP; MESG, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. actions (3Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent x-ray crystallography and mutagenesis studies have helped to establish that, like the case of Ras-RasGAP interaction (4Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and to certain extent the case of heterotrimeric G-protein-RGS interaction (5Sprang S.R.

Biol. 1997; 4: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Rho GTPases undergo a transition state mimicked by a combination of AlF4− and RhoGAP in the GTPase-activating reaction catalyzed by RhoGAP (7Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Nurmahomed K. Owen D. Laue E. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rho GTPases appear to utilize a conserved arginine residue, termed “arginine finger”, of RhoGAP to stabilize the transition state and to catalyze the cleavage of γPi from the bound GTP (3Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,8Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). This arginine finger mechanism of GTPase activation is apparently shared by both Ras and Gαi, since critical arginine residues in RasGAP and Gαi itself (Arg789 in RasGAP and Arg178 in a built-in domain of Gαi) have been demonstrated to play essential roles in the GTPase-activating process (10Ahmadian M.R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Here we report an unexpected finding that Arg186in Rho GTPases functions effectively as a built-in “arginine finger” to confer a self-stimulatory GAP activity through homophilic interaction. MESG and mantGDP were synthesized as described previously (12Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

Recombinant human RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Cdc42Hs, andCaenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster Cdc42 (Cdc42Ce and Cdc42Dm, kind gifts of Drs. L. Lim and L. Luo) were expressed in Escherichia coli as (His)6-tagged fusions using the pET expression system (12Zhang B. Wang Z.-X. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

The posttranslationally modified RhoA, Cdc42Hs, S. cerevisiae Cdc42 (Cdc42Sc) and the Cdc42ScK186R mutant were obtained in an insect cell expression system similarly as described (16Zheng Y.

The RhoA, Cdc42Hs, and Cdc42Sc mutants at the amino acid 186 position (RhoAS(R), Cdc42HsR(K), and Cdc42ScK186R) were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the respective cDNAs (17Li R.

The C-terminal truncation mutations of Cdc42Hs (C-7) and RhoA (Rho-8) were generated previously (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

The GTPase activities of the small GTPases were measured by the MESG/phosphorylase system monitoring the free γPi release from the GTP-bound G-proteins as described for the cases of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA (12Zhang B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A Superdex 200HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled to a Bio-Rad Biologic liquid chromatography system was used to analyze the homophilic interactions of the small GTPases as described (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The fluorescence change of small G-protein bound mantGDP in the presence of AlF4− and the activated form of the G-protein was used to detect a GAP-reaction transition-state complex formation (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cdc42 K186R mutant was cloned into the pRS306 plasmid and integrated into the genome of the diploid strain DJD6–11 (cdc42Δ::TRP1/CDC42 ura3–52/ura3–52) at the ura3–52 locus. Stable Ura+ transformants were subjected to tetrad analysis to follow the ura3–52::cdc42 K186R::URA3 andcdc42Δ::TRP1 marked loci. A Ura+, Trp+ segregant (CCY1–8A) that contained the cdc42 K186R allele as the sole copy ofCDC42 within the cell was backcrossed against wild-type strain Y763 two times to generate the strain CCY3–3B. The Ras superfamily small GTP-binding proteins are monomeric GTP-hydrolyzing enzymes that contain slow intrinsic GTPase activities (20Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2698) Google Scholar). Certain members of the Rho family GTPases of the Ras superfamily,e.g. RhoA, Rac2, and Cdc42Hs, form reversible homodimers under physiological buffer conditions in vitro (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Others such as RhoB and RhoC were found in either monomeric or oligomeric form (data not shown). Although sharing a very high degree of sequence homology, RhoA and RhoB behaved like Ras proteins showing a slow intrinsic GTPase reaction rate at ∼0.02 min−1 that was GTPase dose-independent, whereas the rate of GTP hydrolysis by RhoC was found to increase significantly with increasing concentrations of the G-protein bound to GTP (Fig.1 A). Addition of GTPγS-bound RhoC to RhoC-GTP resulted in a further enhanced rate of γPi release similar to that seen with the addition of RhoGAP, whereas GTPγS-bound RhoA or RhoB had no detectable effect on the respective G-proteins bound to GTP (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the activated form of RhoC, but not RhoA or RhoB, can provide a specific GAP activity toward itself. This self-stimulatory GAP activity may account for the faster intrinsic GTP-hydrolysis rate of RhoC compared with RhoA and RhoB (Fig. 1, A and B). Previous studies of the Rho family members Cdc42Hs and Rac2 also showed that these two GTPases contain a self-stimulatory GAP activity when in the activated GTP-bound form (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment analysis revealed that the presence of a C-terminal polybasic motif, located immediately N-terminal to the CAAX isoprenylation sequences (Fig.1 C), correlated with the homophilic interaction of Rho family members. All Rho family proteins containing the polybasic sequences, including the additional mammalian members Rac1, Rac2, Cdc42Hs, and RhoG, have been found in reversible homodimer or higher oligomer and monomer states, whereas others lacking the polybasic residues, e.g. TC10 and RhoB, are exclusively monomeric like Ras 2B. Zhang and Y. Zheng, unpublished observations. (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Together with the finding that removal or substitution of the C-terminal polybasic residues led to the monomeric form only (see below) and a loss of self-stimulatory GAP activity2 (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the polybasic nature of the C-terminal domain is critical in mediating the homophilic interactions of specific Rho family GTPases. However, the homophilic interaction itself apparently is not sufficient for the enhanced GTP hydrolysis rate because RhoA does not display detectable GAP activity toward itself albeit containing C-terminal polybasic residues (Figs. 1B and 1C); rather, additional unique structural determinant(s) of the Rho GTPases are required for the observed self-stimulatory GAP activity. Specific arginine residues of RasGAP, RhoGAP, and a built-in GTPase-activating domain of Gαi1, known as “arginine fingers,” have been shown to facilitate the effective cleavage of phosphodiester bond linking γPi of the G-protein-bound GTP in their respective GTPase-activating reactions (3Bourne H.R. Nature. 1997; 389: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, sequence motifs that contain invariant arginine residues suspected to play a role in catalyzing GTP-hydrolysis have also been identified in the GAPs for the Rap, Ypt, Ran, and Arf proteins (4Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and an invariant arginine residue in the built-in ArfGAP domain of ARD1, an Arf family GTPase, has been shown to be critical for the ARD1 GAP activity (28Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2553-2560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An examination of the polybasic region of Cdc42Hs, RhoC, RhoG, Rac1, and Rac2 (Fig. 1 C), which all displayed a faster intrinsic GTPase activity, suggested that a highly conserved arginine residue, arginine 186 (numbered by the sequences of Cdc42Hs), might be involved in the observed self-stimulatory GAP activity and the enhanced intrinsic GTPase activity of the Rho proteins. Mutation of the corresponding residue in RhoA, serine 188, to arginine (RhoAS(R)), resulted in a significant increase of the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis (Fig. 2 A) and a gain of self-stimulatory GAP activity (Fig. 2 B). Substitution of the arginine 186 residue of Cdc42Hs by lysine (Cdc42HsR(K)) effectively decreased the intrinsic rate of GTPase activity of Cdc42Hs to that of the wild-type RhoA (Fig. 2 A) and led to a loss of the self-stimulatory GAP activity (Fig.2 B). Both RhoAS(R) and Cdc42HsR(K) behaved indistinguishably in their GTP-binding and GDP/GTP-exchange properties from the wild-type proteins (data not shown). Moreover, posttranslational modification of the Rho proteins by C-terminal geranylgeranylation did not change the GTPase-activating effect of the arginine residue (data not shown). These results indicate that arginine 186 of the Rho family GTPases constitutes a critical determinant for the self-stimulatory GAP activity that controls their intrinsic GTPase activities. To determine whether arginine 186 plays a role primarily in the catalytic or homophilic binding interaction of the G-proteins, the RhoAS(R) and Cdc42HsR(K) mutants were further examined by a fluorescence assay originally designed to detect the formation of a transition-state complex for the Ras-RasGAP and Rho-RhoGAP interactions (19Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Oswald R.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4392-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and by gel-filtration analysis. In the case of the small G-protein-GAP interaction, addition of GAP together with AlF4− causes a change of the emission spectrum of the G-protein bound to the fluorescent GDP-analog, mantGDP, both in maximum absorption wavelength and in intensity (19Mittal R. Ahmadian M.R. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1996; 273: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 21Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Oswald R.E. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4392-4399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, this was observed when GTPγS-bound RhoAS(R) mutant (as GAP) together with AlF4− was added to RhoAS(R)-mantGDP (Fig. 3). This result is indicative of the formation of an analog of the GTP-bound transition state of the GTPase-activating reaction involving RhoAS(R)-mantGDP, AlF4−, and RhoAS(R)-GTPγS. Wild-type RhoA, in contrast, failed to form a transition-state complex with AlF4− when RhoA-mantGDP and RhoA-GTPγS were incubated together (Fig. 3, insert). This result is consistent with its inability to act as a self-stimulatory GAP. When Cdc42Hs and Cdc42HsR(K) were examined in similar experiments, it was found that the Cdc42Hs mutant had lost the ability to form the transition-state complex with Cdc42HsR(K)-mantGDP and AlF4− when bound to GTPγS, whereas wild-type Cdc42Hs behaved like the RhoAS(R) mutant (Fig. 3,insert). However, no change in the gel-filtration profiles was detected for Cdc42HsR(K) and RhoAS(R), with each mutant protein showing a similar monomer/dimer distribution pattern as the respective wild-type proteins (data not shown). Truncation of the last seven and eight amino acids from Cdc42Hs (C-7) and RhoA (Rho-8), respectively, resulted in only the monomeric form of the proteins (13Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25728-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that the self-stimulatory GAP reaction of Rho family GTPases employs an arginine finger-like mechanism similar to the RhoGAP-catalyzed reaction, i.e. the arginine 186 residue is essential for the formation of a GAP-reaction intermediate, but is not required for homophilic binding interaction. To determine the potential physiological relevance of the arginine finger-mediated self-regulation of Rho family GTPases, we examined the role of arginine 186 in the Cdc42 subfamily. The eleven members of the Cdc42 subfamily that have been identified from S. cerevisiaeto Homo sapiens share over 80% amino acid sequence identify, and they can functionally complement each other under defined conditions (2Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 22Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 23Chen W. Lim H.H. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13280-13288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, arginine 186 is found in all the Cdc42 sequences from D. melanogaster and higher organisms, whereas a lysine or serine residue is present at the 186 position of Cdc42 from C. elegans and lower eukaryotes (Fig.4 A). The arginine finger theory would predict that Cdc42 from higher eukaryotes than D. melanogaster should contain a faster intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate than that of lower eukaryotes because of the catalytic effect of arginine 186. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the Cdc42Sc and Cdc42Ce proteins displayed a slow intrinsic GTPase activity similar to that of RhoA and Ras with a GTP hydrolysis rate of 0.02 min−1, whereas Cdc42Dm and Cdc42Hs demonstrated a marked higher intrinsic GTPase activity that can be further stimulated by the respective Cdc42 bound to GTPγS. These results raised the possibility that possession of Arg186 contributes to the mechanism of regulation of the Cdc42 GTPases of higher eukaryotes. To determine thein vivo effect of the built-in arginine finger, a lysine to arginine mutation was introduced into Cdc42Sc at position 186. Cdc42Sc is an essential gene product in S. cerevisiae and plays a critical role in polarized cell growth and cell division cycle regulation (24Johnson D.I. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka K. Takai Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Purified wild-type Cdc42Sc showed an intrinsic GTP hydrolysis ability similar to that of RhoA, whereas the Cdc42ScK186R mutant protein displayed a significantly enhanced GTPase activity similar to that of Cdc42Hs (Figs.5 A and 2 B). Genomic integration of cdc42 K186R mutation into aS. cerevisiae Δcdc42 strain resulted in a temperature-sensitive lethal phenotype at 37 °C (Fig.5 B). At the permissive temperature of 23 °C, thecdc42 K186R mutant led to a pleiotropic phenotype of elongated, multibudded, multinucleated cells (68%) and large, round unbudded cells (13%) (Fig. 5 C, and data not shown), which is similar to phenotypes observed with S. cerevisiae CDC42effector cla4 and ste20 mutants (26Eby J.J.

Given that the cdc42 K186R mutant seems to be able to interact with regulators of Cdc42 such as Cdc24 and Bem3 like the wild-type protein,2 it is likely that the introduced arginine finger is involved in an abnormal negative regulation of Cdc42Sc function, contributing to the temperature-sensitive phenotype and morphological abnormalities.Figure 5A regulatory role of Arg186of Cdc42Sc in S. cerevisiae.

We demonstrate here that specific Rho family proteins may employ an additional built-in arginine finger-like mechanism through homophilic interaction to effectively accelerate the basal intrinsic GTPase activity. This additional negative regulation mechanism seems to be absent from many Rho GTPases from lower eukaryotes, and introduction of this arginine finger into such GTPases results in abnormal negative regulatory effects leading to morphological defects and lethality. Because the currently available three-dimensional structures of Rho family GTPases were all derived from various C-terminal truncated forms of the proteins, it remains to be seen how the homodimers are configured so that the C-terminal polybasic domain containing the critical arginine residue of one molecule may interact with the GTP binding core of another molecule. To this end, we have started to map the residues on Rho GTPases that may serve as sites for Arg186 action and have identified Tyr32 of Cdc42Hs at the GTP hydrolytic center as one of such sites.2It will be important in the near future to obtain a complete picture of the structural configurations of the Rho family homodimers and to compare it with that of the Rho GTPase-GAP complexes. We propose that the built-in arginine finger mechanism may provide an alternative to RhoGAP-mediated negative regulation for Rho GTPases from higher eukaryotes, thereby increasing the flexibility for the regulatory circuit of these small GTPases. The discovery of this novel type of negative regulation may provide valuable information concerning the many diverse roles of Rho GTPases and may generate an interesting paradigm for possible negative therapeutics involving these GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2037913601,"It has been reported that there are two alternatively spliced variants of phospholipase C-δ4 (PLCδ4), termed ALT I and II, that contain an additional 32 and 14 amino acids in their respective sequences in the linker region between the catalytic X and Y domains (Lee, S. B., and Rhee, S. G. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25–31). We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel alternative splicing isoform of PLCδ4, termed ALT III, as a negative regulator of PLC. In ALT III, alternative splicing occurred in the catalytic X domain,i.e. 63 amino acids (residues 424–486) containing the C-terminal of the X domain and linker region were substituted for 32 amino acids corresponding to the insert sequence of ALT I. Although the expression level of ALT III was found to be much lower in most tissues and cells compared with that of PLCδ4, it was significantly higher in some neural cells, such as NIE-115 cells and p19 cells differentiated to neural cells by retinoic acid. Interestingly, recombinant ALT III protein did not retain enzymatic activity, and the activity of PLCδ4 overexpressed in COS7 cells was markedly decreased by the co-expression of ALT III but not by ALT I or II. Moreover, N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (PH domain) of ALT III alone could inhibit the increase of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate levels in PLCδ4-overexpressing NIH3T3 cells, whereas a PH domain deletion mutant could not, indicating that the PH domain is necessary and sufficient for its inhibitory effect. The ALT III PH domain specifically bound to phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 but not PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, or inositol phosphates, and the mutant R36G, which retained only weak affinity for PtdIns-4,5-P2, could not inhibit the activity of PLCδ4. These results indicate that PtdIns-4,5-P2 binding to PH domain is essential for the inhibitory effect of ALT III. ALT III also inhibited PLCδ1 activity and partially suppressed PLCγ1 activity, but not PLCβ1 in vitro; it did inhibit all types of isozymes tested in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that ALT III is a negative regulator of PLC that is most effective against the PLC δ-type isozymes, and its PH domain is essential for its function.

This reaction produces two intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins-1,4,5-P3) and diacylglycerol, which cause the increase of intracellular calcium concentration and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), respectively (1Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These cascades are thought to be terminated by the dephosphorylation of Ins-1,4,5-P3 by inositol phosphate phosphatases (2Sims C.E. Allbritton N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4052-4058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol kinases (3Hodgkin M.N. Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Michell R.H. Pemberton A.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 200-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, since two signals are generated simultaneously by one enzyme (an enzyme of PLC), there might be also a mechanism that turns off these cascades simultaneously, i.e. a negative regulation of PLC. The PLC family is comprised of 10 subtypes found in mammalian species, and on the basis of their structure, they have been divided into three classes, β (β1–4), γ (γ1 and 2), and δ (δ1–4) types (4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Positive regulation mechanisms of PLC by association with membrane receptors are well characterized in β- and γ-type isozymes. β-Type isozymes are activated by the Gα or Gβγ subunit released from heterotrimeric Gαβγ proteins after ligand stimulation (4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 5Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Type isozymes are activated by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues through the activation of receptor or nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 8Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1109-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which δ-type isozymes are coupled to membrane receptors remains unclear. Several recent studies indicate that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of PLC isozymes are also important for the activity of the isozymes. First, PLCδ1 was shown to be activated by the binding of PtdIns-4,5-P2 to its PH domain and inhibited by the binding of Ins-1,4,5-P3 to the same domain (10Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.F. Wang L.P. Kuan Y.S.

Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the basis of the information obtained from the three-dimensional structure of PLCδ1, a catalytic mechanism comprising two steps, tether and fix, was proposed (13Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar); the PH domain tethers the enzyme to the membrane by specific binding to PtdIns-4,5-P2, and the C2 domain fixes the catalytic domain in a productive orientation on the membrane. Therefore, the PH domain plays a important role for the first contact to the plasma membrane. Second, more recent studies indicate that the PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 binding to the PH domain is involved in the protein tyrosine kinase-independent activation of PLCγ1. It has been reported that the overexpression of PtdIns-3 kinase, which produces PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, results in the activation of PLCγ1 by the binding of PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to the N-terminal PH domain (14Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SH2-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase, which removes 5′-phosphates from phosphoinositides, was shown to eliminate the PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-dependent activation of PLCγ1 in B cells, resulting in a decrease in Ins-1,4,5-P3formation and decreased calcium mobilization (15EI-Scharenberg A.M. Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO. J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Scharenberg A.M. Kinet J.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Therefore, SH2-containing inositol-5′-phosphatase functions as a negative regulator of PLCγ1 by inhibiting PtdIns-3,4,5-P3-dependent activation, at least in B cells. Negative regulations of PLC by protein kinase C (PKC) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase are also known (4Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 17Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G.

The proposed targets for phosphorylation by these kinases include cell-surface receptors, G proteins, and PLC itself. cAMP-dependent protein kinase directly phosphorylates the serine residues of PLCβ2 and -β3 and inhibits the stimulation of their activity by Gβγ or Gαq, respectively (17Liu M. Simon M.I. Nature. 1996; 382: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Yue C. Dodge K.L. Weber G. Sanborn B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18023-18027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). PLCβ1 is phosphorylated by PKCα, resulting in the inhibition of its activation by Gβ/γ (21Litosch I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was also reported that gelsolin and profilin, which bind to PtdIns-4,5-P2, compete with PLC for PtdIns-4,5-P2, resulting in the inhibition of the activity of PLCβ and -γ, respectively (22Sun H.Q.

Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). However, the negative regulation mechanism of PLC δ-types remains unknown. Here, we report that a novel spliced variant of PLCδ4, termed ALT III, functions as a negative regulator of PLC through its PH domain. ALT III inhibited the activity of PLCδ most effectively among the PLC isozymes in vivo and in vitro. This is the first demonstration of a negative regulator of PLC δ-type isozymes. [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2, [3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3, and [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) were from Doosan Sedary Research Laboratories, Ins-1,4,5-P3, Ins-1,3,4,5-P4, and bradykinin were from Sigma, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-4-P were purified from bovine spinal cords. PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 (both acyl groups are palmitoyl) was chemically synthesized. The transfected cell selection kit, the MACSelect4 and the MACS high-gradient magnetic separation columns were purchased from Miltenyl Biotec (Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). The Ins-1,4,5-P3 assay kit was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The rabbit polyclonal anti-PLCδ4 antibody was raised against the C-terminal 157 amino acid-tagged 6xHis using the vector pQE-31. PLCβ1, -γ1, and -δ1 were purified from bovine brain by using a three-step column chromatography technique (24Homma Y. Emori Y. Shibasaki F. Suzuki K. Takenawa T. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from rat tissues by the guanidinium isothiocyanate method and from culture cells by the Nonidet P-40 method. A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using rat testis total RNA as described previously (25Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, the entire coding region of PLCδ4 cDNA was amplified with two sets of primers, both of which corresponded to the 5′- or 3′-untranslated regions of the cDNA by two consecutive rounds of PCR. The second-round PCR products were subcloned into the vector pBluescript (KS−). The nucleotide sequences were determined by the autocycle sequencing method using a DSQ-1000 DNA sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Among these clones, two clones coding a novel splice variant of PLCδ4, termed ALT III, were identified. To determine the tissue distribution of PLCδ4 isoforms, first strand cDNA was amplified with PLCδ4-specific primers (nucleotides 1187–1206 and 1658–1677) to produce 491- (PLCδ4), 587- (ALT I), 533- (ALT II), and 398-base pair (ALT III) fragments. PCR was performed for 24 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 15 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C with 10 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and the products were detected by autoradiography. We confirmed that these products were linearly amplified during this cycle. Lysates from various tissues and cells were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with anti-PLCδ4 antibodies and stained with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Alternatively, primary incubation using anti-PLCδ4 antibody was followed by the incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. Membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. COS7, N1E-115, and Bosc23 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). NIH3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% calf serum. PC12 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% horse serum and 5% FBS. C6 cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 nutrient medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% horse serum and 2.5% FBS. NG108–15 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 1 μmaminopterin, and 16 μm thymidine. p19 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% FBS. The induction of the differentiation of p19 cells with retinoic acid was performed as described previously (26Edwards M.K. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). NG108-15 and p19 cells were kindly provided by Dr. T. Michikawa (University of Tokyo). PLCδ4, ALT I, II, and III were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (kindly provided from Dr. F. Shibasaki (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science)). The pMACS4 vector carrying cDNA of CD4 was co-transfected with pcDNA3 carrying cDNAs encoding PLCδ4, ALT I, II, and III in COS7 cells. Transfections were performed by electroporation (Bio-Rad). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days and harvested. The cells were then applied on the MACS high gradient magnetic separation columns to collect the cells expressing CD4 protein, and after 3 washes, the cells bound to the column were eluted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates from the harvested cells were then used for the PLC assay. The retrovirus vector, pMx, was kindly provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo). cDNAs of PLCδ4, ALT III, and ALT III PH (nucleotides 1–376), ΔPH domain (nucleotides 202–3′-end), and PLCδ1 were subcloned into this vector. Recombinant retroviruses were generated and infected to NIH3T3 cells as described (27Kitamura T. Onishi M. Kinoshita S. Shibuya A. Miyajima A. Nolan G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9146-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNAs of interest were transfected in Bosc23 cells, in which the recombinant retrovirus is produced, and the cells were incubated for 2 days. The supernatant of the cells that contained the recombinant virus was then collected, and exponentially growing NIH3T3 cells were infected in the virus solutions for 2 days. After that, the cells were harvested. Alternatively, cells were further incubated in starvation medium (DMEM supplemented with insulin/transferrin/sodium selenite supplement (ITS) and bovine albumin serum (Boehringer Mannheim)) for 24 h, stimulated by 1 μm bradykinin or 50 ng/ml PDGF for the indicated time (see figure legends) and harvested. Cells infected with the recombinant viruses containing cDNA of green fluorescent protein were used as the control. Recombinant PLCδ4 and ALT III proteins were prepared using a baculovirus expression system. cDNA of PLCδ4 and ALT III was subcloned into the vector pFastbac (Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant, clonal baculoviruses were generated according to the protocol described by Life Technologies, Inc. Sf9 cells were grown at 28 °C in Sf-900 II SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS. Baculoviruses were used to infect at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The proteins were purified according a method described previously (25Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PLC activity was assayed with [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2 as the substrate. The PtdIns-4,5-P2-hydrolyzing activity was measured with mixed phospholipid micelles containing 40 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, 5 μm PtdIns-4,5-P2, and 1 μCi/ml [3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2. The lipids in chloroform were dried under a steam of nitrogen gas, suspended in assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 40 or 100 μmCaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine albumin serum (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany)), and subjected to sonication. All proteins added to the reaction mixture were dialyzed overnight against the assay buffer. Incubation was performed for 10 min at 37 °C in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing lipid micelles (5 μm[3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2, 20,000 dpm). The reaction was stopped by adding 2 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Inositol trisphosphates were extracted with 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl, and the radioactivities in the upper aqueous phase were measured. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing the ALT III PH domain (nucleotides 1–860) and R36G ALT III PH were constructed. Site-directed mutagenesis by a two-stage PCR method was performed as described (28Cheng H.F. Jiang M.J. Chen C.L. Liu S.M. Wong L.P. Lomasney J.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5495-5505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the lysates were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads. After three washes, proteins were eluted and dialyzed overnight against binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Purified fusion proteins were mixed with micelles containing 2 μm[3H]PtdIns-4,5-P2, 20,000 dpm, 6 μm phosphatidylserine, and 18 μmphosphatidylcholine in 50 μl of the binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Then 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were added, and the tubes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with occasionally mixing. The tubes were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 2 min, and the radioactivity bound to beads was then measured. Recombinant GST fusion proteins containing the ALT III PH domain or PLCδ1 PH domain (nucleotides 1–880) were expressed in E. coli and purified. Ins-1,4,5-P3 and Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 binding assays using [3H]Ins-1,4,5-P3 and [3H]Ins-1,3,4,5-P4 were performed as described elsewhere (29Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Yaakob H.B. Yagisawa H. Ikehara Y. Watanabe Y. Tan Z. Shears S.B. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ins-1,4,5-P3 levels were assayed using a commercial Ins1,4,5-P3 assay kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PLCδ4 is an enzyme that is inducible in response to mitogenic stimuli, and its expression is restricted in several tissues and cells (30Liu N. Fukami K. Yu H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 355-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition to such characters, two alternatively spliced variants of PLCδ4, termed ALT I and ALT II, are also known to exist (25Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To understand the specific function of PLCδ4 and the mechanisms of its regulation, we tried to obtain another isoform of PLCδ4. The entire coding region of PLCδ4 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR as described by Lee and Rhee (25Lee S.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), subcloned into the vector pBluescript KS(−), and sequenced. The complete sequence of these products revealed that a novel splice variant termed ALT III could be obtained in addition to the reported isoforms, including PLCδ4, ALT I, and ALT II. In ALT III, 63 amino acids containing the C-terminal of the catalytic X domain and linker region between the catalytic X and Y domains were substituted for 32 amino acids corresponding to the insert sequence of ALT I (Fig. 1 A). ALT III protein was highly expressed in some neural cells (Fig.2 C), indicating that it exists in living cells and is not an artifact obtained by PCR. An analysis of the genomic DNA sequence of PLCδ4 revealed that PLCδ4, ALT I, II, and III were generated from a single gene by alternative splicings. 2K. Fukami, K. Takenaka, A. Ito, K. Nagano, and T. Takenawa, submitted for publication. ALT I and II mRNA are comprised of exons IX, X, XI and new exons X′ or X“ between exons X and XI of the gene, respectively. A splicing donor site for the exon X was not recognized in ALT III, and ALT III is comprised of exons IX, XI, and a new exon, X′. Thus, ALT III contains amino acids VMKCPMSCLLICVHVLAQAPNSIPESILLPKR instead of the region from 424 to 486 (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Distribution of PLCδ4 isoforms.

Lysates from rat tissues and culture cells were subjected to an immunoblot analysis with affinity purified polyclonal antibodies to PLCδ4 (Fig. 2, A and C). The expressions of PLCδ4 isoforms mRNA were also examined by RT-PCR with a pair of PLCδ4-specific primers (Fig. 2 B). Both analyses indicated that PLCδ4 was expressed in the brain and testis, and weak signals were observed in the heart and lung. The expressions of ALT I and II were abundant in the testis. A strong signal for ALT III was detected by immunoblotting in the heart. Some differences between the results of the RT-PCR and those of the immunoblotting were observed. For instance, although the expression of PLCδ4 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in the spleen and kidney, the proteins were not detected. Also, ALT II and III proteins were detected by immunoblotting in the liver, and PLCδ4 protein was detected in the thymus, but the respective mRNAs were not detected. Although the ALT III expression was at quite a lower level compared with that of PLCδ4 in most tissues and cells, it was abundant in NIE-115 cells (a mouse neuroblastoma cell line) and p19 cells differentiated to neural cells by 5 × 10−7m retinoic acid (Fig.2 C). In C6 cells, a rat glioblastoma cell line, PLCδ4, and ALT III were quite rich. We also detected PLCδ4 and ALT III mRNA in these cell lines by RT-PCR (data not shown). It was noteworthy that the expression level of ALT III was significantly higher in differentiated neural p19 cells compared with that in undifferentiated embryonic p19 cells. Since ALT III lacks a part of the X domain and almost the entire linker region, we expected that ALT III would not retain enzymatic activity. To investigate this, we subcloned the full-length of all PLCδ4 isoforms into the vector pcDNA3, and the encoded genes were co-expressed with the vector carrying CD4 gene in COS7 cells. Transfected cells were separated by magnetic beads to collect the cells expressing CD4 protein. At least 30% of the cells expressing CD4 protein were co-transfected with PLCδ4 (data not shown). Therefore, PLCδ4-overexpressing cells were concentrated enough to detect the activity of PLCδ4 in their lysates. Fig.3 A shows that PLCδ4 and ALT II retained their activity up to 2.7- and 2.8-fold, respectively, compared with the control, whereas the activity of ALT I only reached approximately 1.5-fold. ALT III does not have PLC activity at all. We also confirmed that recombinant ALT III protein generated by the Sf9/baculovirus system did not retain PLC activity (data not shown). Moreover, the activity of PLCδ4 was markedly decreased by the co-expression of ALT III, to less than 40%, but not by ALT I (Fig.3 B). On the other hand, ALT II is catalytically as active as PLCδ4, but PLCδ4 activity was rather suppressed by the co-expression of ALT II, slightly (Fig. 3 B). We do not know why it happened. However, we confirmed that the activity of recombinant PLCδ4 protein was not inhibited by the addition of the recombinant ALT II protein generated by Sf9/baculovirus system (data not shown). Therefore, this partial suppression by ALT II may be caused by some factors that affect the function of ALT II in vivo. In order to clarify how PLCδ4 is inhibited by ALT III in vivo, we next investigated whether the PH domain alone or the PH domain deletion mutant of ALT III could inhibit the activity of PLCδ4. PLCδ4, ALT III, the PH domain coding region, and PH domain deletion mutant cDNAs were expressed by a retrovirus system in NIH3T3 cells. The cells expressing various constructs were then harvested, and the Ins-1,4,5-P3 level was measured. As a result, ALT III did not retain enzymatic activity and inhibited the activity of PLCδ4 in vivo (Fig. 3 C). Moreover, the ALT III PH domain alone could completely block the activity of PLCδ4, whereas the PH domain deletion mutant could not (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that the ALT III PH domain is necessary and sufficient for its inhibitory effect. We then analyzed the binding of inositol phospholipid to the ALT III PH domain. A recombinant GST fusion protein containing the ALT III PH domain and the mutant R36G were expressed in E. coli and purified, and an inositol phospholipid binding assay was performed. Since Arg-36 of ALT III corresponds to Arg-40 of PLCδ1, which is essential for the Ins-1,4,5-P3 binding and catalytic activity of PLCδ1 (31Yagisawa H. Sakuma K. Paterson H.F. Cheung R. Allen V.

Rab proteins are GTPases that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound conformation. A prerequisite to Rab activation by GTP loading is its post-translational modification by the addition of geranylgeranyl moieties to highly conserved C-terminal cysteine residues. We examined the effect of insulin on the activity of geranylgeranyltransferase II (GGTase II) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. In fibroblasts, insulin increased the enzymatic activity of GGTase II 2.5-fold after 1 h of incubation, an effect that is blocked by perillyl alcohol, an inhibitor of prenyltransferases, but not by the geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor, GGTI-298, or the farnesyltransferase inhibitor, α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid. Concomitantly, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of the GGTase II α-subunit without any effect on the GGTase II β-subunit. At the same time, insulin also increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts from 44 ± 1.2% in control cells to 63 ± 3.8 and 64 ± 6.1% after 1 and 24 h of incubation, respectively. In adipocytes, insulin increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-4 from 38 ± 0.6% in control cells to 56 ± 1.7 and 60 ± 2.6% after 1 and 24 h of incubation, respectively. In both fibroblasts and adipocytes, the presence of perillyl alcohol blocked the ability of insulin to increase geranylgeranylation of Rab-4, whereas GGTI-298 and α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid were without effect, indicating that insulin activates GGTase II. In summary, insulin promotes phosphorylation and activation of GGTase II in both 3T3 L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes and increases the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 and Rab-4 proteins.

The family of Rab proteins is believed to play a crucial role in the intracellular trafficking of vesicles along the endocytic and exocytic pathways (1Balch W.E. Trends Biochem.

Although the exact role and mechanism of action of Rab proteins remain to be elucidated, it appears that Rab proteins are involved in the process of vesicular transport and precise targeting of membranous vesicles to their docking and/or fusion sites (5Goud B.

Post-translational modification of small molecular mass GTP-binding proteins is accomplished by the isoprenylation of conserved cysteine residues found on their C termini (10Zhang F.L. Casey P.J.

Ras and Rho proteins are prenylated on a single cysteine residue of the CAAX box (where C is cysteine, A is the aliphatic residue, and X is methionine, serine, or glutamine for Ras and leucine for Rho proteins) by farnesyltransferase (FTase) 1The abbreviations used are: FTase, farnesyltransferase; GGTase, geranylgeranyltransferase; α-HFPA, α-hydroxyfarnesylphosphonic acid; POH, (S)-(−)-perillyl alcohol; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and geranylgeranyltransferase I (GGTase I), respectively. In contrast, Rab proteins, which terminate with C-terminal cysteine motifs of CC or CXC, are double prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase II (GGTase II) (10Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

GGTase II, which is also known as Rab GGTase, consists of a 60-kDa α-subunit and a 38-kDa β-subunit heterodimer that are closely associated with a 95-kDa protein called the Rab escort protein (10Zhang F.L.

The Rab escort protein binds together with the α/β dimer of GGTase II as a holoenzyme complex and functions to present Rab proteins to GGTase II for prenylation. We have recently demonstrated that insulin promotes the phosphorylation and activation of FTase, a ubiquitous enzyme responsible for the attachment of farnesyl (3 isoprenes, 15 carbons) to p21ras proteins (14Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27585-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that insulin, in a time-dependent fashion, stimulated the phosphorylation of the FTase α-subunit (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an event that correlated well with insulin-stimulated FTase activity (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because FTase and GGTase I share the same α-subunit (17Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), one could assume that the enzymatic activity of GGTase I might also be regulated by insulin. However, the potential influence of insulin on GGTase II, which has approximately 20–30% homology with FTase and GGTase I, has not been verified experimentally. In the present study, we utilized Rab-3 and Rab-4, two substrates of GGTase II, to evaluate the effect of insulin on GGTase II activity in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes. We observed that insulin promoted the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of GGTase II and an increase in GGTase II activity. Consequently, we found insulin increased amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 and Rab-4 in the insulin-challenged cells.

Two days after confluence, fibroblasts were fed differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mm glutamine) plus differentiation mix (2.5 ml of 10× phosphate-buffered saline, 55 mg of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 20 ml of deionized water, 250 μl of 49 mm dexamethasone, 2.5 mg of insulin). On day 4, adipocytes were fed adipocyte growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5 mm glutamine) plus 100 nminsulin. Cells were refed every 2 days with adipocyte growth medium and used on days 10–12. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 24 h, incubated with or without insulin (100 nm), and then lysed in 500 μl of buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmsodium phosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Crude lysates were sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm. Total protein from the resultant supernatant was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and diluted to 1 mg/ml. Equal volumes of lysate and 4% Triton X-114 were combined in a borosilicate glass tube, vortexed, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min. Solutions were kept at room temperature until phases had separated. Equal volumes from each phase were placed into separate 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and Rab-3 or Rab-4 was immunoprecipitated using antibodies to Rab-3A or Rab-4. Relative amounts of Rab proteins were determined by Western blotting followed by densitometry. Cultured cells were serum- and phosphate-starved for 6 h and then incubated at 37 °C overnight with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (10 mCi/mmol). Cells were then incubated for various times with or without insulin (100 nm). Lysates (in buffer A) were sonicated and centrifuged. Protein concentrations were diluted to 1 mg/ml. GGTase II α- and β-subunits were immunoprecipitated with GGTase α- or β-subunit rabbit antiserum, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. GGTase II activity was assayed in vitro using a modified method of Moores et al. (19Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J.

In brief, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, incubated for designated times with insulin (100 nm) in the presence or absence of inhibitors, and lysed in 500 μl of buffer A. The in vitro enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding a 5-μl aliquot of diluted extract (0.5 mg/ml) to 45 μl of reaction assay solution (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 nm Rab-3 protein, 100 nmtritiated geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ([3H]GGPP) (15 mCi/mmol), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min the assay was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold 1m HCl in ethanol, and the samples were placed on ice for 15 min. Solutions were filtered through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filters. Each filter was air-dried, placed in a scintillation vial with 3 ml of scintillation fluid, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The in vitro GGTase II assay was linear with respect to time and extract protein. Confluent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were placed in serum-free medium containing lovastatin (2 μg/ml) and [3H]mevalonolactone (10 μCi) for 24 h. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with or without insulin (100 nm), lysed, and normalized for protein. Rab-3 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the aqueous and detergent fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins and labeled product were determined by Western blotting and autoradiography, respectively, and quantified by densitometry. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with or without insulin (100 nm) for 1 h, lysed, and normalized for protein. Thein vitro reaction was initiated by adding a 5-μl aliquot of diluted extract (0.5 mg/ml) to 45 μl of reaction assay solution (5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 nm Rab-3 protein, 100 nm tritiated geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ([3H]GGPP) (15 mCi/mmol), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C. After 30 min the assay was stopped with 50 μl of ice-cold 1 m HCl in ethanol, and the samples were placed on ice for 15 min. Samples were diluted to 800 μl with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with an equal volume of 4% Triton X-114 for 3 min. Rab-3 proteins were then immunoprecipitated from the aqueous and detergent fractions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins and labeled product were determined by Western blotting and autoradiography, respectively. Data were analyzed by Student's paired or unpaired t test with a p value of <0.05 considered significant. Insulin, a potent modulator of FTase activity in various tissues, increases the amounts of cellular farnesylated p21ras (14Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol.

To determine whether insulin can also stimulate other prenyltransferases, we examined its effect on GGTase II activity. Initially, we performed an in vitroassay of GGTase II activity in control and insulin-treated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. The cells were exposed to insulin for up to 2 h, and their lysates were then used as a source of enzyme (GGTase II) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzymatic activity of GGTase II is expressed as the amount of [3H]GGPP (counts/min) attached to the recombinant Rab-3 in vitro. Insulin significantly increased the enzymatic activity of GGTase II 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) after 45 min of incubation and 2.5-fold (p < 0.01) after 1 h of incubation (Fig.1). This effect of insulin was blocked by 1 mm POH, an inhibitor of prenyltransferases, but not by GGTI-298, an inhibitor of GGTase I, or α-HFPA, an inhibitor of FTase. Because insulin-stimulated activation of FTase has been shown to be related to the phosphorylation of its α-subunit (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined whether or not insulin could also promote the phosphorylation of GGTase II. Insulin appears to induce a rapid phosphorylation of the GGTase II α-subunit, without any effect on its β-subunit (Fig.2). Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the α-subunit was detectable by 10 min and clearly evident by 1 h. Taken together, these data indicated that, as with FTase, insulin-stimulated activation of GGTase II correlated with its phosphorylation. Because we previously showed that the activation of FTase by insulin resulted in significant increases in the amount of farnesylated p21ras (14Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked if insulin-stimulated augmentation in GGTase II activity might result in increases in the amount of geranylgeranylated Rab proteins. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of insulin on the geranylgeranylation of Rab-3 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and PC-12 cells, using the method of Triton X-114 extraction (21Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To validate this technique, we needed to establish that only prenylated Rab-3 protein was extracted into the detergent phase. To this end, we extracted the lysis buffer A containing unprocessed (bacterially expressed) Rab-3 protein with Triton X-114 and determined that unprocessed (nonprenylated) Rab-3 was detected only in the aqueous phase (Fig. 3 A). Conversely, endogenous geranylgeranylated Rab-3 was detected only in the detergent phase (Fig. 3, B and D). In these experiments, the cells were incubated with lovastatin (2 μg/ml) to inhibit isoprenoid synthesis and then with 10 μCi of [3H]mevalonate, a precursor of geranylgeranyl moiety that enters the synthetic pathway downstream of the lovastatin block. The cells were then lysed and extracted with Triton X-114. Newly labeled geranylgeranylated Rab-3 was detected only in the detergent phase (Fig.3 D), whereas Rab-3 detected in the aqueous phase by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B) was not prenylated. Finally, we determined that the recombinant Rab-3 that was prenylated in vitro with labeled geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was recovered only in the detergent phase (Fig. 3, C and E). Subsequently, using the Triton X-114 extraction method we found that geranylgeranylation of Rab-3 was significantly enhanced by insulin in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (Fig. 4) and PC-12 cells (not shown). Insulin significantly increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts from 44 ± 1.2% in control cells to 63 ± 3.8% (p < 0.01) after 1 h of incubation and to 64 ± 6.1% (p < 0.01) after 24 h of incubation. POH but not GGTI-298 or α-HFPA blocked the effects of insulin on geranylgeranylation of Rab-3. Taken together, these results suggest that geranylgeranylation of Rab-3 is mediated by the activity of GGTase II and augmented by insulin action. Because Rab-4 has been implicated in the mechanism of the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (22Cormont M. Tanti J.F. Zahraoui A. Van Obberghen E. Tavitian A. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19491-19497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bortoluzzi M.N. Cormont M. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we were also interested in the effect of insulin on Rab-4 prenylation. In the next series of experiments we examined the effect of insulin on the geranylgeranylation of Rab-4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Insulin significantly increased the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-4 from 38 ± 0.6% in control cells to 56 ± 1.7% (p < 0.01) after 1 h of incubation and to 60 ± 2.6% (p < 0.01) after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 5). Similarly to the experiments with Rab-3, the presence of POH (1 mm) blocked the ability of insulin to increase geranylgeranylation of Rab-4, whereas GGTI-298 and α-HFPA were without effect. Interestingly, the ability of insulin to increase the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-4 was also inhibited by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD 98056, but not by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Fig.6).Figure 6Effect of PD98056 and wortmannin on insulin-stimulated geranylgeranylation of Rab-4. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated in the absence (white bar, control) or presence (black bar) of insulin (INS) (100 nm) and with or without the designated inhibitor for 24 h. Prior to the insulin challenge, designated groups were preincubated with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (hatched bar), PD98059 (20 μm), for 1 h or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (cross-hatched bar), wortmannin (100 nm), for 30 min. Rab-4 was immunoprecipitated from aqueous and detergent fractions, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, determined by Western blotting, and quantified by densitometry.

This aspect of insulin action appears to be similar to its ability to phosphorylate and activate FTase and to increase the amounts of farnesylated p21ras(14Goalstone M.L. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27585-27589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that insulin promotes the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the FTase in association with augmented FTase activity (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the same α-subunit belongs to GGTase I as well (17Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1991; 65: 429-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), one could predict that insulin would also activate GGTase I. Our ongoing studies support this prediction. 2M. L. Goalstone, M. R. Stjernholm, J. W. Leitner, and B. Draznin, unpublished observations. Thus, based on the current findings (activation of GGTase II) and previous observations (activation of FTase), we conclude that insulin is a major regulator of isoprenylation of the small molecular mass GTP-binding proteins. To further strengthen this conclusion, the following questions must be addressed. What is the precise mechanism of the effect of insulin on prenyltransferases? What is the physiological significance of this aspect of insulin action? Our previous work has addressed certain elements of both questions. We have determined that the effect of insulin on FTase is specific. Other growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1, epidermal growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor failed to promote FTase phosphorylation and stimulate its activity (15Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, insulin appears to promote the phosphorylation of the FTase α-subunit in a positive feedback fashion (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the ability of insulin to activate the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was critical for the subsequent phosphorylation and activation of FTase. The latter, in turn, increased the amounts of farnesylated p21ras proteins making them available for activation by GTP loading (15Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Leitner J.W. Kline T. Carel K. Goalstone M. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that the effect of insulin on GGTase II also involves phosphorylation of the α-subunit of this enzyme (Fig. 2). Moreover, the ability of insulin to increase the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-4 was blocked by the inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase pathway (Fig. 6), emphasizing a similarity to the mechanism of the effect of insulin on FTase and farnesylation of Ras (16Goalstone M. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5119-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological and/or pathophysiological role of the insulin-induced modulation of isoprenylation of small molecular mass GTPases constitutes the second major question in this field. At present, we can only state that insulin, via its ability to regulate the amounts of prenylated Ras and Rab, creates a certain background that is responsible for the magnitude of activation of these GTPases by their appropriate stimuli. Interestingly, cells that are derived from insulin receptor-deficient mice exhibited normal basal levels of farnesylated p21ras, although they failed to respond to an insulin challenge (15Goalstone M.L.

Moreover, even using potent inhibitors of FTase (15Goalstone M.L. Leitner J.W. Wall K. Dolgonos L. Rother K.I. Accili D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23892-23896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Leitner J.W. Kline T. Carel K. Goalstone M. Draznin B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2211-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and GGTase I and II (present study) we were unable to deplete the cells of the prenylated Ras or Rab within a time frame of our experiments (24 h). These observations suggest that insulin is only responsible for augmenting and modulating prenyltransferase activity over the basal rates of their activity. Clearly, additional experiments are needed to gain more insight into the mechanism of the insulin action on FTase and GGTase I and II. Geranylgeranylation of Rab proteins is believed to be the first step in their post-translational modification, allowing them to interact with cellular membranes (8Schafer W.R. Rine J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 30: 209-237Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 9Gibbs J.B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 10Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

Reversible phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Rab-4 and Rab-1 appears to add an extra layer of control that determines cellular localization of these proteins during the cell cycle (interphase versus mitosis) (24Bailly E. McCaffrey M. Touchot N. Zahraoui A. Goud B. Bornens M. Nature. 1991; 350: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 25van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Prenylated Rab-4 and Rab-3 have been found in both soluble and membranous cellular fractions (26Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M. Perin M.S. Hanson T.J. Burger P.M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), suggesting that prenylation itself is not solely responsible for the membrane association. Moreover, van der Sluijs et al. (25van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that 82% of the newly geranylgeranylated wild-type Rab-4 was found in the cytosol of the mitotic Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mutation of Ser-196 to glutamine or aspartic acid completely prevented Rab-4 phosphorylation in mitotic cells and blocked its appearance in the cytosol (25van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Association of Rab proteins with the GDP-dissociation inhibitor protein represents an additional mechanism that regulates the interaction of Rab proteins with cellular membranes (26Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M. Perin M.S. Hanson T.J. Burger P.M. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1988-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 27Pfeffer S.R.

Chinniet al. (30Chinni S.R. Brenz M. Shisheva A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that even though the release of GDP-dissociation inhibitor from the intracellular membranes did not affect the cellular distribution of Rab-4 (only Rab-5 was affected) it was associated with the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter (GLUT)-4 membrane trafficking. Whether or not geranylgeranylation plays a significant physiological role in the mechanism of Rab-4 involvement in the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake remains unknown. Our previous experiments with inhibition of prenylation by lovastatin (31Reusch J.E.-B. Bhuripanyo P. Carel K. Leitner J.W. Hsieh P. DePaolo D. Draznin B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2036-2040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) suggest that insulin essentially stimulates glucose transport normally in cells pretreated with lovastatin for up to 24 h. However, within the time frame of the experiments (24–48 h) inhibitors do not deplete the pool of prenylated Rab-4 below the basal levels that may be sufficient to assure the normal function of Rab-4 in response to insulin. Longer term experiments in the future, both with insulin and the GGTase II inhibitors, are needed to examine this relationship. Although the physiological and pathophysiological significance of the ability of insulin to increase the amounts of geranylgeranylated Rab-3 and Rab-4 remains unknown, new data presented here indicate that insulin is an important regulator of the cellular pool of prenylated Rab proteins available for GTP loading and carrying out their specific biological functions."

Both catalytic activities require ATP; the APS kinase domain involves cleavage of the β-γ phosphodiester bond of ATP, whereas the ATP sulfurylase domain involves cleavage of the α-β phosphodiester bond of ATP. Previous mutational studies have suggested that β-γ phosphodiesterase activity involves a highly conserved NTP-binding P-loop motif located in the adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate kinase domain of PAPS synthases. Sequence alignment analysis of PAPS synthases and the superfamily of TagD-related nucleotidylyltransferases revealed the presence of a highly conserved HXGH motif in the ATP sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthases, a motif implicated in the α-β phosphodiesterase activity of cytidylyltransferases. Thus, site-selected mutagenesis of the HXGH motif in the ATP sulfurylase domain of human PAPS synthase (amino acids 425–428) was performed to examine this possibility. Either H425A or H428A mutation produced an inactive enzyme. In contrast, a N426K mutation resulted in increased enzymatic activity. A G427A single mutant resulted in only a modest 30% reduction in catalytic activity, whereas a G427A/H428A double mutant produced an inactive enzyme. These results suggest an important role for the HXGH histidines in the ATP sulfurylase activity of bifunctional PAPS synthase and support the hypothesis that the highly conserved HXGH motif found in the ATP sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthases is involved in ATP binding and α-β phosphodiesterase activity. 3′-Phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) synthase is a bifunctional protein consisting of an NH2-terminal APS kinase and a COOH-terminal ATP sulfurylase.

In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule (1Gregory J.D. Robbins P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1960; 29: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the activated sulfate molecule is 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS). 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; hPAPS, human PAPS; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PEI, polyethyleneimine cellulose. 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; hPAPS, human PAPS; APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PEI, polyethyleneimine cellulose.The activation of inorganic sulfate to form PAPS results from the concerted action of two enzymes (1Gregory J.D. Robbins P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1960; 29: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The first step is catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase (ATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.4) and involves the reaction of inorganic sulfate with ATP to form adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphate. This reaction results in the formation of a high energy phosphoric-sulfuric acid anhydride bond that is the chemical basis for sulfate activation (2Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The second step involves APS reacting with another molecule of ATP to form PAPS and ADP and is catalyzed by APS kinase (ATP:adenylylsulfate 3′-phosphotransferase, EC2.7.1.25). ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase cloned from bacteria, Fungi, yeast, and plants are found on separate polypeptide chains; however, in mammalian species, the marine worm, and the fruit fly, gene fusion has occurred, and the two enzymes are integral to bifunctional PAPS synthase. It has been clearly established that the NH2-terminal region of human (h) PAPS synthase constitutes the APS kinase domain, whereas the ATP sulfurylase domain is located in the COOH-terminal portion of this bifunctional protein (3Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). That is, the NH2-terminal 268 amino acids of hPAPS synthase (623 amino acids) when overexpressed and purified functions independently as an APS kinase (3Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J.

Dev. 1997; 68: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) PAPS synthase. The P-loop motif is highly conserved among NTP-binding proteins where it is involved in binding the phosphate moiety and in the cleavage of the β-γ phosphodiester bond of NTP (7Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar, 8Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that site-selected mutagenesis of the P-loop motif in mouse PAPS synthase markedly impaired APS kinase activity (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The latter finding would be in keeping with the hypothesis that the P-loop motif located near the NH2terminus of PAPS synthase is involved in cleavage of the β-γ phosphodiester bond of ATP and transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group of ATP to the 3′-hydroxyl position of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate. In contrast to the NH2-terminal APS kinase domain of PAPS synthase, the COOH-terminal ATP sulfurylase domain does not and would not necessarily be expected to contain a classical P-loop motif for ATP binding. The reason being that although the COOH-terminal ATP sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthase binds ATP as does the NH2-terminal domain, the ultimate fate of the bound ATP is not the same. That is, APS kinase catalyzes the removal of the terminal γ-phosphate for transfer to the acceptor molecule, APS, whereas ATP sulfurylase catalyzes the removal of the β-γ diphosphate (inorganic pyrophosphate) of ATP and condensation of the formed AMP with inorganic sulfate to form APS. It might, therefore, be expected that the latter function would require a different type of nucleotide-binding site, one that would function as an α-β phosphodiesterase rather than a β-γ phosphodiesterase. Inspection of the data base search (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar) output for the COOH-terminal domain of hPAPS synthase revealed a HXGH motif that is conserved throughout the PAPS synthase family. This motif has been previously characterized as the signature of a large family of (predicted) nucleotidylyltransferases, prototyped by the Bacillus subtilis cytidylyltransferase TagD; all functionally characterized proteins of this family cleave the α-β phosphate bond of an NTP (11Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that site-selected mutagenesis of the HXGH motif implicates this motif in the ATP sulfurylase reaction of bifunctional hPAPS synthase, a finding consistent with the concept that the HXGH sequence is involved in ATP binding and α-β phosphodiesterase activity. Radionucleotides [α-35S]ATP for DNA sequencing, inorganic [35S]SO4 (1300 Ci/mmol), and [35S]PAPS for enzyme assays were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. and Gene Probe Technology (Gaithersburg, MD). Site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Version-2 sequencing kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Agarose was purchased from FMC BioProducts (Rockland, ME) and polyethyleneimine cellulose (PEI)-TLC plates were purchased from Merck. Wild type full-length hPAPS synthase (GenBankTM accession number U53447) and mutant hPAPS synthase constructs were amplified by PCR using primers designed to contain BamHI restriction sites, cloned intoBamHI digested pET-19b vectors containing a proprietary 122-base pair NcoI-NdeI cassette (Veritas, Potomac, MD) encoding the calmodulin-binding site of calcineurin followed by a histidine tag and an enterokinase cleavage site, and used for transformation of Escherichia coli essentially as described previously (3Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Plasmids were used for transformation of DH-5α competent E. coli cells by the CaCl2method. Transformants were isolated and miniprepped, and plasmids were sequenced for correct orientation of the initiator codon with respect to the T7 promoter sequence. The pET-19b vectors containing the correct inserts were isolated and used for transformation of expression host cells from Stratagene (BL21-DE3 plyz). The conserved purported NTP-binding motif (HXGH) located in the COOH-terminal region of human PAPS synthase was subjected to mutational analysis. Thus, amino acid substitutions were carried out in the HNGH sequence (amino acids 425–428). Site-selected mutagenesis was performed according to Stratagene's quik change mutagenesis kit. For example, oligonucleotides (54 nucleotides) containing the respective base substitutions were synthesized. Employing the wild type hPAPS synthase expression vector plasmid pET-19b, mutations were performed by PCR using the substituted primer and Pfu DNA polymerase. Thermal cycle phases consisted of either 12 cycles (single mutation) or 16 cycles (double mutation) of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 68 °C for 12 min. After PCR, the methylated parent template plasmid was digested with theDpnI restriction enzyme, and the circular dsDNA was used to transform XL1-Blue supercompetent cells. Colonies were isolated, miniprepped, and sequenced. Verified mutant plasmids were used to transform pLyz BL21-DE3 overexpression bacteria that are deficient in proteases. Plasmids were isolated and sequenced to verify the presence of the proper mutation. Colonies were grown in LB broth containing ampicillin to an A 595 nmof ∼0.5, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce expression. Induction was carried out for 3 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 1.2 mg/ml lysozyme), and the cell suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. The original tube was washed with 100 μl of lysis buffer, the wash was added to the cell suspension, cell lysis was carried out by incubation at 25 °C for 7 min, and lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. Wild type hPAPS synthase and mutant proteins were purified using nickel columns. Bacteria were grown in LB broth to an A 595 nmof ∼0.5, at which time 1 mm IPTG was added to induce expression as noted above. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed using lysis buffer as before, and the clear extract was mixed with 1 ml of slurry of nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The contents were gently rotated on a wheel at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The contents were then poured into small columns and washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) until the A 280 nm was less than 0.01. The columns were subsequently washed with six column volumes of buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and eluted with 1 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. Enzyme activity was determined in a total volume of 10 μl consisting of 3 μl of sample, 3 μl of reaction buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, and 45 mm dithiothreitol), 1 μl of 50 mm ATP, and 3 μl of inorganic [35S]SO4 (∼3.4 μCi). Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped by placing the reaction tubes in boiling water for 5 min. Aliquots (1 μl) were transferred to PEI-TLC plates and developed using 0.9m LiCl as the solvent system. Following chromatography, the PEI-TLC plates were dried and exposed overnight to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The respective spots for PAPS, APS, and SO4were excised, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Expressed purified proteins (30 μl from 1 ml peak fractions) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide gels obtained from Novex, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Membranes were soaked in a solution of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 45 min by gentle shaking, after which they were exposed to primary antibody (1:1000), which had been preadsorbed with E. coli extract (0.5 mg/ml), for 1 h. The primary antibody was generated against a COOH-terminal peptide fragment of human PAPS synthase as previously reported (3Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Blots were washed three times with wash buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Tween 20) and incubated with the secondary antibody in blocking buffer (1:5000) for an additional 1 h. Finally, the membranes were subjected to three washes in wash buffer and two additional washes in reaction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The blots were developed by color reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Searches of the protein sequence data base (the nonredundant data base at the NCBI) were performed using the gapped BLAST program, the position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST), and the pattern-hit initiated BLAST (PHI-BLAST) programs (10Altschul S.F.

Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments were constructed using either the Clustal W program (13Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar) or the MACAW program (14Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar,15Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lawrence C.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 8: 1618-1632Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Initially, the presence of the HX(G/A)H motif that is strictly conserved in the COOH-terminal, ATP sulfurylase domain of the PAPS synthases as well as ATP sulfurylases was noticed by visual inspection of the data base search outputs and multiple alignments of this domain (data not shown). Data base searches started with the PAPS synthase sequences because the queries failed to detect significant similarity to any members of the TagD superfamily, although limited similarity to some of them was detectable when the search was performed using the PHI-BLAST program that combined BLAST analysis with the detection of the HX(G/A)H pattern (12Zhang Z. Schaffer A.A. Miller W. Madden T.L. Lipman D.J. Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3986-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). By contrast, in a search initiated with the sequence of the nucleotidylyltransferase domain of the NadR protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosisusing the PSI-BLAST program (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar), members of the PAPS synthase superfamily were retrieved at a statistically significant level (p < 0.01) within 8–10 search iterations (10Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar, 16Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 444-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Although quite subtle (11% identity on a 189-amino acid overlap), the alignment between NadR and PAPS synthases encompassed almost the whole nucleotidylyltransferase domain (data not shown). Multiple alignment analysis using the MACAW program (14Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 15Neuwald A.F. Liu J.S. Lawrence C.E. Protein Sci. 1995; 8: 1618-1632Crossref Scopus (322) Google Scholar) showed that not only the HX(G/A)H but also the surrounding hydrophobic positions that form the basis of a predicted β-loop-α structural unit were conserved in the PAPS synthases and the TagD superfamily (Fig.1). Expression of partially purified wild type and mutant protein preparations was clearly demonstrated (Fig.2). The level of expression of the mutant construct N426A was consistently higher than the other constructs in three independent experiments, whereas the level of expression for all other constructs was nearly equal. In a mock control, i.e.vector without a hPAPS synthase insert, no protein expression was observed (Fig. 2). Vectors (wild type and mutants) not under the control of promoter induction by IPTG, as well as mock controls, exhibited no demonstrable catalytic activity. Relative PAPS synthase specific activities in cellular extracts for wild type hPAPS synthase, the mutant constructs, and the mock control are presented in Fig. 3. The mutant constructs H425A, H428A, and G427A/H428A exhibited only background activity similar to that of the mock control. On the other hand, the mutant construct N426K formed 185.8 pmol PAPS/min·mg, which was about 2-fold higher than the activity of 96.8 pmol PAPS/min·mg demonstrated by wild type hPAPS synthase. The G427A mutant formed 72.2 pmol PAPS/min·mg, a value slightly less than wild type. Sequence analysis has shown the relatedness of the nucleotidylyltransferase superfamily and TagD and revealed a connection between this category of enzymes and the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases whose structure is known (11Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Based on crystal structure for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, structural predictions for the nucleotidylyltransferases mapped a conserved HXGH motif to a position analogous to the location of the ATP-binding HIGH motif in the tRNA synthetases (11Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, a structural and functional link was proposed for the TagD superfamily and the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with the HXGH motif in the cytidylyltransferase superfamily functioning as a NTP-binding site analogous to the HIGH motif serving as an ATP-binding site for the tRNA synthetases. Interestingly, the HXGH motif is completely conserved in cloned bifunctional PAPS synthase proteins, i.e. the marine worm (5Rosenthal E. Leustek T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), mouse (4Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidis A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol.

Genet. 1987; 210: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ATP sulfurylase domain of bifunctional PAPS synthase is located in the COOH-terminal region of the protein (3Venkatachalam K.V. Akita H. Strott C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19311-19320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and it is in this segment of PAPS synthase that the HXGH motif is located. A unifying functional feature of the TagD nucleotidylyltransferase superfamily and the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is their α-β phosphodiesterase activity. It has been proposed that the conserved HXGH motif in this superfamily is involved in NTP binding (23Veitch D.P. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10743-10750Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), an hypothesis strengthened by recent mutational analyses (24Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our finding that mutating either H425A or H428A of the HXGH motif in hPAPS synthase produced an inactive enzyme is comparable with the results of similar mutations carried out with CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (24Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The G427A mutation of hPAPS synthase resulted in approximately a 30% reduction in overall enzymatic activity, a finding also comparable with a similar mutation carried out with CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (24Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, as with the TagD superfamily, mutational studies with hPAPS synthase support the proposition that the highly conserved HXGH motif in the ATP sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthases is involved in NTP binding. Crystal structures of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases indicate that the HIGH sequence is located in the first loop of a β-α-β unit, which allows the imidazole nitrogens to form hydrogen-binding contacts with the phosphate oxygens of ATP (11Bork P. Holm L. Koonin E.V. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 22: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutational studies of the HXGH motif in CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase also implicate the involvement of similar contacts with CTP (24Veitch D.P. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It follows that the results of the mutational studies involving the HXGH motif in hPAPS synthase should be analogously interpreted. Whereas the H425A and H428A mutants of hPAPS synthase produced inactive enzymes, only a modest reduction (∼30%) in PAPS synthase activity was noted with the G427A mutant compared with the wild type enzyme. On the other hand, the N426K mutant yielded an increase in PAPS synthase activity, suggesting that the ε-NH3 group of lysine creates a more efficient enzyme than the amide NH2 of asparagine, perhaps by creating enhanced hydrogen contact with ATP. During PAPS formation by bifunctional PAPS synthase (ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase) two molecules of ATP are required, one for each reaction. Site-selected mutagenesis of a P-loop motif (GXXGXGK(T/S)) located in the NH2-terminal, APS kinase domain of mouse PAPS synthase markedly impaired APS kinase activity (9Deyrup A.T. Krishnan S. Cockburn B.N. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9450-9456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a finding in keeping with the purported role of the NTP-binding P-loop motif in the cleavage of the β-γ phosphodiester bond of ATP and transfer of the terminal phosphoryl group to the 3′-hydroxyl position of APS. In contrast to the NH2-terminal, APS kinase domain, the COOH-terminal, ATP sulfurylase domain of PAPS synthase, acting as an α-β phosphodiesterase during the formation of APS from ATP and inorganic sulfate, requires a different type of NTP-binding site. Based on the results of site-selected mutagenesis of hPAPS synthase, we propose that the domain homologous to the TagD superfamily nucleotidylyltransferases and in particular, the completely conserved HXGH motif located in the ATP sulfurylase domain of all bifunctional PAPS synthases fulfills such a function.

Here we characterize two previously unrecognized RT-PCR products of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) RNA. DNA products with apparent sizes of 600 and 1200 base pairs (bp) were detected at high cycle numbers. Heat denaturation of the smaller product and subsequent reannealing revealed that it was a heteroduplex consisting of two different DNA strands. These were identified by DNA sequencing as the amplification products of two VEGF transcripts, i.e. VEGF121 and VEGF165, which differ by the presence of one exon. S1 nuclease analysis showed that this exon is bulged out as a single-stranded loop. Purified heteroduplexes in solution were found to form a 1200-bp DNA product which could be reconverted into 600-bp DNA heteroduplexes by mild denaturation at 70 °C. These findings suggest that this product is formed by base pairing of complementary heteroduplex loops and represents a novel four-stranded DNA structure.

Alternative splicing generates different mRNA species from a common precursor molecule, and these mRNAs may encode proteins that differ in their biochemical and biological properties. One example for this phenomenon is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). which is an important regulator of angiogenesis and blood vessel permeability (1Ferrara N.

Dermatol. 1995; 104: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Of its three major splice forms only VEGF165 and VEGF189 bind heparin, whereas VEGF121 does not. Moreover, VEGF165 and VEGF121, but not VEGF189, are secreted from cells. Two further splice variants, VEGF145 and VEGF206, have been found at low abundancy in some tissues (3Charnock-Jones D.S.

Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). All VEGF isoforms contain the amino acids encoded by the exons 1–5 and by exon 8 of the VEGF gene. Exon 6 is present in VEGF145, VEGF189, and VEGF206. Only VEGF189 and VEGF206contain exon 7. An extension of exon 6 because of utilization of an alternative splice donor site is specific for VEGF206. All variants of alternatively spliced mRNAs can be detected simultaneously by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis if the annealing sites of the two primers are selected at both sides of the facultative exons in exons common to all transcripts. The resulting DNA products corresponding to the different mRNA variants are usually identified by size and/or by Southern hybridization. We found that RT-PCR analysis of alternatively spliced genes is complicated by the appearance of previously unrecognized DNA complexes which are composed of amplification products from different transcripts. We have characterized the structure of heteroduplexes with large single-stranded loops and have shown that these heteroduplexes form novel four-stranded DNA-complexes. Total RNA was extracted from the human epidermoid cell line A431 with RNazol (Cinna/MRC, Cincinatti, Ohio) and reverse-transcribed as described previously (2Ballaun C. Weninger W. Uthman A. Weich H. Tschachler E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For amplification of VEGF-specific cDNAs, a sense primer annealing within exon 1 (5′-CCA TGA ACT TTC TGC TGT CTT-3′) and an antisense primer derived from the untranslated region of exon 8 (5′-TCG ATC GTT CTG TAT CAG TCT-3′) (2Ballaun C. Weninger W. Uthman A. Weich H. Tschachler E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) were used in a reaction involving denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 min. The number of cycles was varied from 25 to 40. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. DNA was prepared from bands of tris borate-EDTA-agarose gels with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. DNA was eluted from Qiaex particles with water at a temperature of 50 °C for 15 min. 50 ng of DNA were incubated with 20 units of S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) in S1 buffer (33 mmNa-acetate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.03 mmZn2SO47H2O, pH 4.5) for 1 h at 37 °C. Reaction products were separated electrophoretically on a 2% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane. For Southern hybridization, the oligonucleotides used as PCR primers were32P-labeled with terminal transferase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) and incubated with the blot at 65 °C for 2 h. Membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak, Rochester, NY). To detect VEGF splice variants expressed at low levels, PCR was performed on cDNA from A431 cells at high sensitivity conditions. In addition to the previously described isoforms VEGF121, VEGF165, and VEGF189, (2Ballaun C. Weninger W. Uthman A. Weich H. Tschachler E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) which yield amplification products of 526, 658, and 730 bp, respectively (Fig.1 A), an additional band appeared when the number of PCR cycles was raised over 30 (Fig.1 B). This DNA band had an apparent size of approximately 600 bp on a 1.5% agarose gel. Compared with the other bands, its abundancy increased overproportionally during the last PCR cycles (Fig.1 B). These kinetics suggested that the mechanism of its formation was different from the one that generates standard PCR products. Southern hybridization with an oligonucleotide recognizing all known splice forms of VEGF confirmed that the 600-bp band originated from VEGF cDNA (data not shown). An additional band of the apparent size of 1200 bp was found when we tried to maximize the amplification yield by combinations of high cycle number, high amounts of cDNA template, and high polymerase concentrations (see below). For further analysis, the 600-bp band was purified from an agarose gel as described under “Materials and Methods.” When its DNA strands were melted at 95 °C and allowed to reanneal, three DNA species were observed: the 600-bp band and the bands corresponding to the size expected for the VEGF121 and VEGF165amplification products (Fig.2 A). The identity of the two latter DNA species was confirmed by sequencing. To test whether these two components were sufficient for the formation of “600-bp DNA”, purified VEGF121 and VEGF165 PCR products were mixed, denatured, and renatured. An additional band with the apparent size of 600 bp was obtained (Fig. 2 B). These data demonstrated that the 600-bp band represents a heteroduplex of VEGF121 and VEGF165 strands. To elucidate the structure of the VEGF121/VEGF165 heteroduplex, DNA from the 600-bp band was digested with S1 nuclease. The cleavage products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with radioactively labeled oligonucleotides. To specifically recognize cleavage products containing the 5′ or the 3′ terminus of the VEGF gene, the corresponding PCR primers were used as probes. Using the PCR primer annealing at the 5′ end of VEGF, we obtained a signal corresponding to a fragment of 420 bp in length that was not detectable with the 3′ probe (Fig.3, A and B,lanes 2). This size equals the length of the sequence common to all splice variants at the 5′ end of the gene (Fig. 3 C). By hybridization with the 3′ primer, a 100-bp band corresponding to the stretch of sequence identity at the 3′ end of VEGF121 and VEGF165 was detected (Fig. 3 B). From the localization of S1 cleavage site at the position of the VEGF165-specific exon 7, it became evident that this region is single-stranded in the complex. Both the 100- and the 420-bp band are generated by cleavage of both heteroduplex DNA strands at the site of sequence divergence. Because of incomplete digestion, an intermediate product, in which only the exposed single-stranded loop but not the second strand of the complex is cleaved, was present in the resulting reaction mixture. Both probes hybridized to that intermediate of 520 bp length (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that the VEGF165-derived heteroduplex DNA strand adopts an Ω-like conformation in which the sequence corresponding to exon 7 forms a single-stranded loop (Fig. 3 C). Because either the sense or antisense strand of both VEGF121 and VEGF165 PCR products can participate in heteroduplex formation, two types of complexes appear. In one of them, the VEGF165-derived exon 7 sequence is exposed in sense orientation. In the other heteroduplex-type, the single-stranded loop is in antisense orientation (Fig. 3 C). The sequence complementarity in the loops suggests that two heteroduplexes might interact through base pairing in that region (as depicted by double arrows in Fig. 3 C). The second aberrant PCR product (1200-bp band), which was detected after maximized DNA amplification (Fig.4 A), was assumed as a potential complex of two VEGF121/VEGF165heteroduplexes because it was exactly twice as large. To investigate whether this product represented a complex stabilized by weak interactions such as local base pairing, PCR products were subjected to mild heat denaturation (heating to 70 °C for 10 min and subsequent chilling on ice). Whereas perfectly double-stranded DNA species and the VEGF121/VEGF165 heteroduplex remained unaffected, the 1200-bp band disappeared (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). When, after purification, DNA from this band was analyzed by gel electrophoresis, only a 600-bp band was found repeatedly (data not shown). In contrast, when DNA derived from the 600-bp band was incubated at high concentrations prior to electrophoresis, a 1200-bp band appeared. Again, heating to 70 °C and rapid chilling abolished that DNA form and led to a proportional increase in the amount of heteroduplex DNA (Fig. 4 B). These findings strongly suggest that this DNA species represents a novel complex of DNA heteroduplexes. The generation of DNA heteroduplexes in experimental procedures has been described previously. Methods for the detection of genomic mutations such as AMD (amplification and mismatch detection) are based on the annealing of sample-derived PCR products with nonmutated bona fide DNA (5Roberts R.G. Montandon A.J. Green P.M. Bentley D.R. McPherson M.J. Quirke P. Taylor G.R. PCR, A Practical Approach. 1. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 51-66Google Scholar). In these analyses, the heteroduplexes consist of DNA strands that differ only by single bases. The formation of heteroduplexes with long unpaired segments has been observed as a complication of quantitative PCRs that use an artificial internal standard with partial sequence identity to the target DNA (6Becker-André M. Hahlbrook K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9437-9446Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 7Henley W.N. Schuebel K.E. Nielsen D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that, in the analysis of genes with alternatively spliced transcripts, heteroduplex formation is a problem even where only qualitative aspects are concerned. We detected heteroduplexes after RT-PCRs of several alternatively spliced mRNAs (data not shown) such as those of the apoptosis regulator bcl-x (9Boise L.H. González-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar) and of caspase 10 (10Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Of particular importance is the appearance of the VEGF121/VEGF165 heteroduplex because, under standard agarose gel electrophoresis conditions, this complex has the same migration rate as the amplification product of a recently described minor splice variant, VEGF145 (3Charnock-Jones D.S. Sharkey A.M. Rajput-Williams J. Burch D. Schofield J.P. Fountain S.A. Boocock C.A. Smith S.K. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 1120-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of VEGF145 expression, we avoided the formation of the VEGF121 and VEGF165amplification products by selecting a 5′ primer that annealed within a part of exon 6 that is present in VEGF189 and VEGF145 but absent from VEGF121 and VEGF165. When cDNA from the A431 cells was used, the band corresponding to VEGF145 was much less abundant than the VEGF189 band. This observation contradicts results presented by Poltorak et al. (11Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) who employed an RT-PCR that allows for the formation of the VEGF121/VEGF165 heteroduplex. In light of our findings, it seems likely that the band obtained by Poltorak et al. (11Poltorak Z. Cohen T. Sivan R. Kandelis Y. Spira G. Vlodavsky I. Keshet E. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7151-7158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) did not originate from VEGF145 but rather represents a VEGF121/VEGF165 heteroduplex. Similar to the amplification products of VEGF121 and VEGF165, VEGF189 must be expected to participate in heteroduplex formation. We could detect a heteroduplex of VEGF145- and VEGF189-derived DNA strands in the PCR reaction specific for those two splice forms but not when VEGF121 and VEGF165 amplification products were present (not shown). This was probably because of co-migration of small amounts of heteroduplexes containing VEGF189 with other PCR products in agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition to the DNA heteroduplex, a second DNA species was identified as a by-product of RT-PCR of alternatively spliced transcripts and was found to be a complex composed of two heteroduplexes. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which such a DNA heteroduplex-duplex is described. Based on the structural information obtained by S1 analysis of the heteroduplex, we conclude that this complex represents a novel DNA structure that is formed by base pairing of sequences exposed in single-stranded loops. Because of the limited length of the accessible complementary sequences, it is less resistant to denaturing conditions such as heating to 70 °C, but was nevertheless found to be stable at 4 °C as well as at room temperature. Because DNA heteroduplex structures are formed during recombination processes and bulging out of noncomplementary segments has been proposed by current recombination models (12Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5736-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that interactions between DNA single-stranded loops could occur in vivo. Similar interactions between short single-stranded RNA loops have been implicated in the regulation of the replication of the bacterial plasmid ColE1 and in the initiation of dimerization of retroviral genomes (13Gregorian R.S. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Mujeeb A. Clever J.L. Billeci T.M. James T.L. Parslow T.G. Nat. Struct.

Further studies are necessary to evaluate the importance of single-stranded DNA loops both in physiological and in experimental settings. We thank Dr. A. Uthman for helpful discussions and C.

Hemoglobin has long served as a paradigm for cooperative proteins (1Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2220) Google Scholar, 2Perutz M.F. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1989; 22: 139-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) and continues to provide new and important insights into how allostery is exploited in processes of pathophysiological importance (3Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Two proposed models of hemoglobin cooperativity have made a significant impact in our understanding of structure-function relations in this and other proteins. The MWC 1The abbreviations used are: MWC, Monod-Wyman-Changeux; KNF, Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer. model (4Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar) assumes that hemoglobin exists in two quaternary structures, T and R, that differ in their affinity for oxygen. The low affinity T state is predominant in the absence of oxygen. Binding of oxygen progressively drives the hemoglobin tetramer to the high affinity R state, thereby bringing out the cooperative nature of the binding curve that is key to the functionin vivo. A key postulate of the MWC model is that site-site interactions are not direct but are mediated indirectly through a concerted allosteric transition from T to R involving the molecule as a whole. An alternative allosteric model, known as the KNF model (5Koshland D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar), assumes that each subunit is capable of tertiary conformational changes upon oxygen binding. These changes are directly transmitted to neighbor subunits through pairwise interactions and lead to sequential changes in the affinity for oxygen. Cooperativity ensues as a result of direct communications. There is much kinetic and structural evidence that the MWC model best represents the behavior of hemoglobin under a variety of conditions (6Henry E.R. Jones C.M. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6511-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but the validity of this model has been challenged (7Ackers G.K. Doyle M.L. Myers D. Dougherty M.A. Science. 1992; 255: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 8Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the molecular code for hemoglobin cooperativity remains to be defined (9Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A.J. Paoli M. Dodson G.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar,10Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 185-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The highly cooperative nature of the oxygen binding isotherm naturally suppresses the contribution of the singly, doubly, and triply ligated species, making it very difficult to discriminate models of cooperativity (11Di Cera E. Thermodynamic Theory of Site-specific Binding Processes in Biological Macromolecules. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar). It has long been recognized that the overall shape of the oxygen binding curve is consistent with many models of cooperativity (5Koshland D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar) and does not provide conclusive discrimination. The precise distribution of ligation intermediates that makes up the oxygen binding curve is more informative, but efforts to resolve these intermediates have been largely confined to model systems where hemoglobin or its ligands bear significant chemical perturbations (10Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 185-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from these model systems are not consistent with either the MWC or the KNF model (8Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 185-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but their relevance to the properties of native hemoglobin reacting with oxygen has been questioned (6Henry E.R. Jones C.M. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6511-6528Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A.J. Paoli M. Dodson G.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Resolution of the ligation intermediates of native hemoglobin reacting with a gaseous ligand is therefore highly desirable. These measurements are presented here for the first time and provide important new information on the mechanism of hemoglobin cooperativity. Weighted samples of HbA0 (5 g/dl) in 0.1 m KCl, deoxygenated in a tonometer using a stream of humidified nitrogen, were introduced into Hamilton gas-tight syringes and mixed with weighted samples of the same solutions exposed to CO. The syringes were kept for 20 h in a closed cylinder filled with water containing dithionite and thermostatted at 20 °C to let the hemoglobin solution equilibrate with CO. The CO saturation was calculated from the sample weights. The methemoglobin content after equilibration was 1–2%. The pH of the mixture was measured anaerobically after the attainment of equilibrium. A constant value of 7.0 ± 0.05 was obtained by adjusting the pH of the hemoglobin solution with 0.1 n KOH before equilibration. The PCO equilibrium value of the mixtures was calculated from the CO binding isotherm obtained previously under the same conditions of solvent, pH, protein concentration, and temperature by equilibrating solutions of HbA0 with CO/N2 mixtures of known composition (12Perrella M. Colosimo A. Benazzi L. Ripamonti M. Rossi-Bernardi L. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples of hemoglobin solutions (100 μl) equilibrated with CO were injected anaerobically into a stirred cryosolvent (60% v/v ethylene glycol, 40% v/v 22 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 20 °C) containing ferricyanide and cooled at −30 °C. Ferricyanide oxidizes the unliganded subunits of hemoglobin yielding a mixture of partially oxidized species that can be separated by cryofocusing at −25 °C on gel tubes. Only nine species are detected by this procedure because the products of the oxidation of the two possible doubly ligated αβ pairs (Fig. 1) have identical isoelectric points. Gels were then removed from the glass tubes and sliced at the level of the colored protein components, which were eluted and assayed. The procedures for the separation and analysis of the isolated intermediates and all the relevant controls are described in detail elsewhere (13Perrella M. Rossi-Bernardi L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Resolution of the intermediates α1COα2β1COβ2and α1COα2β1β2CO(Fig. 1) was obtained by noncryogenic focusing of the mixture of oxidized species isolated as a single component by cryofocusing, as described (14Perrella M. Ripamonti M. Caccia S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2017-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The hemoglobin subunits α and β assembled in the tetramer form two structurally nonequivalent αβ contacts and yield 10 possible ligation states (Fig.1). These states define the model-independent partition function for ligand binding to the four hemes of hemoglobin as follows (11Di Cera E. Thermodynamic Theory of Site-specific Binding Processes in Biological Macromolecules. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar). Ψ=1+2(Kα+Kβ)x+[cααKα2+2(cαβ+cαβ′)KαKβ+cββKβ2]x2Equation 1 +2(cααβKα+cαββKβ)KαKβx3+cααββKα2Kβ2x4where x is the ligand concentration or partial pressure, K α and K βare the binding constants for the α and β subunits when all other subunits are unligated, c αα,c αβ, c′ αβ andc ββ are the second order interaction constants between the four possible pairs of chains,c ααβ and c ααβare the third order interaction constants involving the two possible triplets of chains and c ααββ is the fourth order interaction constants involving all chains. Thec values reflect the presence of positive (c> 1), negative (c < 1) or no (c = 1) cooperativity. For example, a value of c αα = 10 means that ligand binding to the second α chain is enhanced 10-fold when the first α chain is bound. The population of each intermediate is determined by the ratio of the term in the partition function related to the intermediate divided by Ψ. These functions were used to analyze the distribution of CO ligation intermediates obtained experimentally. The site-specific description of ligand binding to the four hemes of hemoglobin is related to the classical Adair description (15Adair G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 63: 529-545Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) that takes into account the five possible ligation states without discriminating between hemoglobin chains. The partition function for this description is Ψ=1+4k1x+6k1k2x2+4k1k2k3x3+k1k2k3k4x4Equation 2 where k i is the stepwise binding constant for the ith ligation step. These constants can be written in terms of the site-specific parameters as follows (11Di Cera E. Thermodynamic Theory of Site-specific Binding Processes in Biological Macromolecules. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar). k1=Kα+Kβ2Equation 3 k2=13cααKα2+2(cαβ+cαβ′)KαKβ+cββKβ2Kα+KβEquation 4 k3=3(cααβKα+cαββKβ)KαKβcααKα2+2(cαβ+cαβ′)KαKβ+cββKβ2Equation 5 k4=2cααββKαKβcααβKα+cαββKβEquation 6 The distribution of CO-ligated intermediates was also analyzed in terms of the MWC and KNF models (4Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6184) Google Scholar, 5Koshland D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar). The partition function of the MWC model is as follows. Ψ=L(1+KαTx)2(1+KβTx)2+(1+KαRx)2(1+KβRx)2L+1Equation 7 where L is the allosteric constant reflecting the population of the T state relative to the R state in the absence of ligand, K αT and K αRare the binding constants to the α chains in the T and R states, andK βT and K βR are the analogous binding constants for the β chains. The partition function for the KNF model is as follows. Ψ=1+2(Kα+Kβ)x+(cααKα2+4cαβKαKβ+cββKβ2)x2+2(cααKα+cββKβ)cαβ2KαKβx3+cααcαβ4cββKα2Kβ2x4Equation 8 where the K values are the binding constants of the two chains and the c values are the pairwise interaction constants between the possible pairs of chains. No distinction was necessary to describe interactions involving the ligated αβ pairs (see “Results”). The two models have the same number of independent parameters and could be compared directly. It follows from definition of the Adair constants in EquationsEquation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6 that different combinations of site-specific parameters reflecting the contribution of the ten ligated states of hemoglobin can translate in the same pattern of stepwise constants. This is because analysis of the binding curve in terms of the Adair formalism contains four independent parameters, as opposed to nine in the site-specific formalism (11Di Cera E. Thermodynamic Theory of Site-specific Binding Processes in Biological Macromolecules. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the distribution of the 10 ligated intermediates in the native molecule reacting with a gaseous ligand provides a very accurate test of any proposed molecular code of hemoglobin cooperativity. A high resolution cryogenic technique (13Perrella M. Rossi-Bernardi L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 445-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) has made it possible to resolve the distribution of intermediates for the reaction of CO with native human hemoglobin (Fig. 2). Because CO shares with oxygen high binding affinity and cooperativity (11Di Cera E. Thermodynamic Theory of Site-specific Binding Processes in Biological Macromolecules. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1995Crossref Google Scholar, 12Perrella M. Colosimo A. Benazzi L. Ripamonti M. Rossi-Bernardi L. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it represents an ideal ligand for dissecting hemoglobin cooperativity at the site-specific level, which cannot be achieved with oxygen in view of its fast kinetics of dissociation (16Olson J.S. Anderson M.E. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5919-5923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the distribution of CO-ligated intermediates as a function of saturation reveals strong cooperativity already in the first two ligation steps (Table I). Binding to the β chain is slightly preferred in the singly ligated species, but such preference disappears in the triply ligated species, indicating that conformational changes taking place at high saturation tend to abolish the differences between the chains. Once the first chain is ligated, the second binding event takes place with significantly higher affinity. Interactions are stronger between α chains and compensate for the lower affinity of these chains compared with the β chains, thereby producing doubly ligated intermediates of comparable magnitude (Fig. 2). No significant difference is observed in the populations of the mixed doubly ligated intermediates where the αβ pair is ligated within or across the dimer interface (c αβ =c′ αβ). Interactions among the ligated chains remain strong in the third and fourth ligation steps, as indicated by the large values of the third and fourth order interaction constants.Table IAnalysis of the CO ligation intermediatesSite-specific analysisMWC modelKNF modelς = 0.00621-aGoodness of fit, normalized by the number of independent parameters.ς = 0.0094ς = 0.0078K α = 1.1 ± 0.1 Torr−1K αT = 1.4 ± 0.1 Torr−1K α = 1.7 ± 0.1 Torr−1K β = 2.3 ± 0.1 Torr−1K βT = 2.6 ± 0.1 Torr−1K β = 2.7 ± 0.1 Torr−1c αα = 49 ± 5K αR = 9.0 ± 0.9 102 Torr−1c αα = 12 ± 2c αβ =c′αβ = 16 ± 2K βR = 9.2 ± 0.9 102Torr−1c αβ = 7 ± 1c ββ = 13 ± 2L = 1.0 ± 0.1 105c ββ = 8 ± 1c ααβ = 2.4 ± 0.4 103c αββ = 1.1 ± 0.2 103c ααββ = 1.1 ± 0.2 106Adair constantsk 1 = 1.7 ± 0.2 Torr−1k 1 = 2.0 ± 0.2 Torr−1k 1 = 2.2 ± 0.2 Torr−1k 2 = 28 ± 2 Torr−1k 2 = 5.9 ± 0.6 Torr−1k 2 = 18 ± 1 Torr−1k 3 = 1.3 ± 0.1 102Torr−1k 3 = 6.1 ± 0.7 102Torr−1k 3 = 1.4 ± 0.1 102Torr−1k 4 = 1.0 ± 0.1 103Torr−1k 4 = 9.1 ± 0.9 102Torr−1k 4 = 1.2 ± 0.1 103Torr−11-a Goodness of fit, normalized by the number of independent parameters. Open table in a new tab The distribution of ligated intermediates has peculiar features that are difficult to reconcile with current models of hemoglobin cooperativity. The significant increase in affinity at the second step of ligation populates the doubly ligated intermediates well beyond the expected value (0.2–0.5%) in the absence of interactions. The MWC model does not account for this important feature of CO ligation (TableI). The best fit parameter values obtained from the analysis of the distributions predict the T to R transition to take place upon binding of the third CO molecule. This provides a satisfactory fit for all but the doubly ligated intermediates, predicted to be only 1%, as opposed to almost 5% found experimentally. The KNF model yields a better fit but again fails to correctly reproduce the distribution of doubly ligated intermediates and the high degree of cooperativity in the first two ligation steps (Table I). Combinatorial switch mechanisms for hemoglobin cooperativity, like the one implied by the “symmetry rule,” also fail to describe the distribution of doubly ligated intermediates, because ligation of an αβ pair is not dependent on the location of the chains in the tetramer. The discrepancies of the MWC and KNF models are also illustrated by the cooperativity pattern embodied by the four stepwise Adair constants (Table I), as shown in Fig. 3. Both models significantly underestimate the affinity of the second ligation step, but the MWC model also overestimates the affinity of the third ligation step. However, the overall saturation curves predicted by these models from the analysis of the distribution of intermediates are practically indistinguishable from each other and from the curve predicted by the model-independent analysis (Fig.4). The excellent agreement of the models with experimental data in Fig. 4 is deceiving, because the shape of the binding isotherm is notoriously insensitive to the contribution of poorly populated intermediates. The limitations of the MWC and KNF models are observed only when the properties of these intermediates are measured directly (Table I). Hence, overall binding isotherms cannot and should not be used to assess the validity of mechanistic models or to discriminate among them.Figure 4CO binding isotherm obtained from the distribution of ligated intermediates shown in Fig. 2. Also shown are the binding curves obtained from the Adair constants derived from analysis of these intermediates using the MWC (continuous line) and KNF (dashed line) models. The two models give an excellent fit of the data, although they are inconsistent with the distribution of doubly ligated intermediates in Fig. 2 and predict Adair constants significantly different from those derived from the model-independent analysis (Table I and Fig. 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The distribution of CO ligation intermediates obtained experimentally and the pattern of stepwise constants derived from them reveal a more subtle mechanism for hemoglobin cooperativity than those predicted by the MWC and KNF models. The KNF model fits the data significantly better than the MWC model, but it does not capture the large enhancement in binding affinity in the first two ligation steps. An unambiguous interpretation of the pattern in Fig. 3 is not possible, because of the limitations intrinsic to the Adair description. It should also be pointed out that the pattern in Fig. 3 applies specifically to the experimental conditions in the present study and may be modified by allosteric effectors and physical variables. For these reasons, we limit ourselves to emphasize the phenomenological significance of the results. A modified MWC model with direct pairwise interactions within the T state would be consistent with the experimental data, but so would a modified KNF model with interactions higher than second order. More information must be gathered on the ligation intermediates of native hemoglobin reacting with a ligand that closely mimics oxygen, before the code of hemoglobin cooperativity can be formulated conclusively. The results reported here represent an important first step in this direction."

The process of targeting membrane and secretory proteins begins in the cytosol when a hydrophobic segment of a nascent polypeptide chain, either a signal sequence or the first transmembrane segment, emerges from the ribosome and is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). The binding of SRP to the ribosome results in a translational arrest, and the whole complex is targeted to translocation sites in the membrane via interactions with the SRP receptor. Translation resumes after dissociation of SRP from the ribosome, and the nascent chain is transferred cotranslationally into the translocon.

Because the Sec61p channel both translocates secretory proteins and integrates membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer, it must coordinate a number of different functions. In the case of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic domains have to be left in the cytoplasm, lumenal domains have to be passed through the membrane, and transmembrane domains have to be properly oriented and inserted into the membrane. In the most simple view, membrane integration of polytopic membrane proteins is thought to be directed by series of alternating signal anchor (SA) and stop transfer (ST) sequences (5Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1496-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 6Friedlander M. Blobel G.

A SA sequence is defined as a hydrophobic segment that has the ability to insert into the membrane in a Ncyt-Clum orientation. The sequence following the SA will be translocated to the lumen until translation of the next hydrophobic region, the ST sequence, which is retained in the membrane as a Nlum-Ccyttransmembrane segment. The following sequences will have a cytoplasmic location until the next SA sequence emerges from the ribosome, and the cycle starts all over again. Although the assembly of some membrane proteins in the ER appears to occur via this mechanism, many studies have suggested that the insertion process is often more complicated and depends on the coordinate action of two or more topogenic sequences in the nascent chain (8Wilkinson B.M.

A role for the ribosome in the recognition of a transmembrane segment has also been documented (11Do H. Falcons D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E.

In Escherichia coli, utilization of the same pathway for export of preproteins and insertion of membrane proteins is a matter of debate. It has been shown that E. coli contains essential genes coding for the proteins Ffh and FtsY, which are homologous to subunits of the eukaryotic SRP and SRP receptor proteins (14Römisch K. Webb J. Herz J. Prehn S. Frank R. Vingron M. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1989; 340: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15Bernstein H.D. Poritz M.A. Strub K. Hoben P.J. Brenner S. Walter P.

Evidence is accumulating that these proteins play an important role in the assembly of inner membrane proteins, suggesting a pathway similar to the one in the ER (16Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A.

Structural similarities between theE. coli SecYEG complex and the eukaryotic Sec61p complex suggest that in E. coli, after targeting, membrane insertion may proceed via the Sec machinery.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2773-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in the bacterial system also, insertion in the cytoplasmic membrane is not always a strictly sequential process. Recently, the membrane topology of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae (CitS) in the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane was studied using a series of CitS-PhoA fusions (23van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of the sequence revealed that the polypeptide contains 12 hydrophobic segments that might span the membrane (Fig.1 A), but the biochemical data unexpectedly suggested the presence of only 9 transmembrane segments. In this model, 3 hydrophobic segments are excluded from the membrane (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that during insertion of CitS factors other than hydrophobicity may play a role in the recognition of transmembrane segments. In view of the unexpected results from the PhoA fusion analysis, we have sought to obtain independent evidence for or against the 9 transmembrane model. To this end, an extensive topological analysis of CitS has been carried out using in vitro translation in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes. The goal has been to identify the topogenic signals and to determine whether they insert as independent units or whether the insertion potencies of the topogenic sequences are context-dependent. Interestingly, our analysis provides clear evidence for a topology with 11 transmembrane segments, which fits better with the hydrophobicity analysis results than does the previous 9 transmembrane model. We also find that a marginally hydrophobic segment in CitS works well as an internal SA sequence but does not have ST activity, suggesting that SA and ST sequences may be recognized in different ways by the translocon. Unless stated otherwise, all enzymes needed for the in vitro transcription and translation reactions, as well as plasmid pGEM1 were obtained from Promega Biotech (Madison, WI). The cap analog m7G(5′)-ppp(5′) and [35S]methionine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). Endo H was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. The glycosylation acceptor peptideN-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-Thr-N-methylamide and the nonacceptor peptideN-benzoyl-Asn-Leu-(allo)Thr-N-methylamide were synthesized according to Erickson and Merrifield (24Erickson B.W. Merrifield R.B. Hill R.L. Neurath H. The Proteins. 2. Academic Press, London1976: 255-527Google Scholar). The signal peptidase (SPase) inhibitorN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone was obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Kebo Laboratory (Stockholm, Sweden) and from Eurosequence (Groningen, The Netherlands). All DNA manipulations were performed using E. coli strains MC1061 (25Dalbey R.E. Wikner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13844-13849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and JM110 (26Yannisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (11460) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEM1 carrying a modified lep gene as anXbaI-SmaI fragment behind the SP6 promoter (27Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was used for the construction of different Lep-CitS (LC) constructs. In the modified lep gene the nucleotide sequences coding for the Asn-Glu-Thr glycosylation acceptor site at position 214–216 in the wild type protein was changed to the nonacceptor sequence Gln-Gln-Thr, whereas an Asn-Ser-Thr glycosylation acceptor site was introduced at codons 90–92, 15 amino acids downstream of H2 (see Fig.1 C). Furthermore BclI and NdeI restriction sites were introduced flanking the H2 region, in codons 59 and 80, respectively. Different fragments of the CitS gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pKSCitS (23van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using forward primers containing a BclI restriction site and backward primers containing an NdeI restriction site. After purification, the polymerase chain reaction products were digested with the BclI and NdeI restriction enzymes and ligated into the pGEM1-Lep plasmid digested with the same two enzymes (see also Fig. 1 C). A second modified lep gene in plasmid pGEM1 was used to measure ST efficiency of CitS sequences and has been described by Sääf et al. (28Sääf A. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, this modifiedlep gene contains an SpeI site and aBglII site engineered in codons 226/227 and 231/232, respectively. The original glycosylation site of the wild type gene was removed as described above, and two new potential glycosylation sites were introduced around codons 97 and 259, respectively. CitS sequences were amplified with forward primers containing an SpeI site and backward primers containing a BamHI site (compatible with BglII) and were cloned between the SpeI andBglII sites of the modified lep gene (see also Fig. 4 C). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA. The pGEM1 plasmids carrying the relevant constructs were linearized at an SmaI site immediately downstream of the coding region before in vitro transcription. mRNA was transcribed from the SP6 promoter in the following reaction mixture: 4 μl of 5 × SP6 transcription buffer, 4 μl of rNTPs +Gcap mix (25 mm ATP, CTP, UTP, 15 mm GTP, 10 mm Gcap), 2 μl of SP6 enzyme mix, and 10 μl of purified and linearized plasmid DNA containing about 0.5 μg of DNA. Transcriptions were carried out at 30 °C for 12 h. The synthesized mRNAs were purified by using a Rneasy Minikit (Qiagen). In vitro translation of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from the in vitro synthesized mRNA was performed in reticulocyte lysate in the presence or absence of dog pancreas microsomes as described by Liljeström et al. (29Liljeström P. Lusa S. Huylebroeck D. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4107-4113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Translation reactions without microsomes contained 0.1% of the detergent pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (Fluka). Translation was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. Translocation of the P2 domain to the lumenal side of the microsomes was assayed by the appearance of N-linked glycosylation. For some constructs, the assay was repeated in the presence of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide and a nonacceptor tripeptide as described (30Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or in the presence of SPase inhibitor. 2M. Nusier and M. O. Lively, unpublished data. For construct LCVb, glycosylation was assayed by Endo H treatment of the translation mixture. The mixtures was incubated with 50 milliunits/ml Endo H in a 1% SDS, 50 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 6 h at 37 °C. All samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% or 12% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were scanned in a FUJIX Bas 1000 PhosphorImaging Plate Scanner and analyzed using the MacBAS software (version 2.31). A study in E. coli with a set of COOH-terminally truncated CitS molecules to which the topological reporter protein alkaline phosphatase was fused (PhoA fusions) suggested that the CitS molecule spans the membrane nine times (23van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The topology model derived from the PhoA fusion data (Fig.1 B) is characterized by a periplasmic COOH terminus and two large, relatively hydrophobic loops in the periplasm which contain segments Vb, VIII, and IX, which were predicted to be transmembrane. Hydrophobic segments VIII and IX are separated by a region AH that could potentially form a strongly amphiphilic α-helix. The different segments of CitS and their average hydrophobicities are listed in Table I.Table IInsertion efficiency of the individual CitS fragments in the ER membraneConstructCitS residuesAverage hydrophobicity1-aCalculated for the 20-residue-long predicted transmembrane segment in the CitS fragment using the Eisenberg scale (39).Net chargeGlycosylationP1 loopP2 loop1-bMeasured from the COOH-terminal end of the predicted transmembrane segment to the glycosylation site in P2.%Lep6+080LCI1–470.737+1−75LCII45–740.796+060LCIII74–1060.837+069LCIV104–1420.606+2+78LCV141–1750.926+1−60LCVb173–1950.566+1−79LCVI201–2400.846+1+78LCVII264–2870.596+1−90LCVIII286–3210.758+2−91LCAH310–3310.060LCIX334–3570.547+1−66LCX365–3890.866+2−72LCXI401–4460.626+1−88Insertion efficiency was measured as the degree of glycosylation of Lep constructs in which the H2 domain was replaced by the indicated CitS fragments (see also Fig. 1 B).1-a Calculated for the 20-residue-long predicted transmembrane segment in the CitS fragment using the Eisenberg scale (39Eisenberg D.

Open table in a new tab Insertion efficiency was measured as the degree of glycosylation of Lep constructs in which the H2 domain was replaced by the indicated CitS fragments (see also Fig. 1 B). The first objective of this study was to examine systematically the propensity of the 12 predicted transmembrane segments plus the putative amphipathic helix AH to form individually a transmembrane α-helix in the ER membrane using an in vitro translation/translocation system. The E. coli inner membrane protein leader peptidase (Lep) was used as an insertion vehicle for the CitS fragments. Lep is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by two NH2-terminal transmembrane segments H1 and H2 which are connected by the P1 domain. The catalytic P2 domain forms the COOH-terminal half of the protein (Fig. 1 C). Upon in vitrotranscription/translation in the presence of dog pancreas microsomes the Lep molecule inserts into the microsomes with both the NH2 and COOH termini facing the lumen and with the P1 and P2 domains in the cytoplasm and lumen, respectively. An engineered glycosylation site COOH-terminal of H2 is glycosylated efficiently upon correct insertion into the microsomal membrane. Glycosylation of the molecule results in an increase in molecular mass of about 2 kDa relative to the observed molecular mass in the absence of microsomes. The efficiency of glycosylation of Lep under standard conditions is 80–90% (30Nilsson I. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5798-5801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The H2 segment of Lep was exchanged with the different segments of CitS (Fig. 1 C). CitS segments with SA function will result in glycosylation of the P2 domain, whereas a segment that lacks SA function will result in nonglycosylated molecules. In all cases but one (LC-AH), translation in the presence of the microsomes resulted in a molecular mass that was about 2 kDa larger than that observed in the absence of the microsomes (Fig. 2 A and Table I), demonstrating a transmembrane disposition of all of the CitS fragments except the amphipathic AH segment. Constructs LCVb and LCVIII were partly processed to a slightly smaller product when translated in the presence of microsomes (lanes 12 and 18). To test the possibility that in these constructs the P2 domain is removed after translocation to the lumen by the endogenous SPase activity, insertion into the microsomal membrane was performed in the presence ofN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone, an inhibitor of the mammalian SPase.2 Formation of the proteolytic product in LCVb and LCVIII was largely inhibited under these conditions, indicating translocation of the P2 domain by segments Vb and VIII (Fig. 2 B). For construct LCVIII, the amount of full-length glycosylated protein was increased significantly, but, surprisingly, for construct LCVb the full-length protein was not glycosylated. Evidence for the glycosylation of the cleaved form of construct LCVb was obtained by treatment with Endo H, an enzyme that removes N-linked oligosaccharides (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1 and 2). Apparently, construct LCVb is glycosylated only after cleavage by SPase. Similarly, glycosylation of construct LCVIII could be demonstrated by a reduction in the molecular mass of the processed product by about 2 kDa when translation was performed in the presence of a glycosylation acceptor tripeptide, a competitive inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, but not in the presence of a nonacceptor tripeptide (Fig. 2 C, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that all 12 hydrophobic segments of CitS can function as internal SA sequences. Strikingly, the 3 hydrophobic segments (Vb, VIII, and IX) that are postulated to be translocated across the membrane in the PhoA model (Fig. 1 B) are SA sequences that are equally as efficient as the other segments. The H2 segment of Lep was replaced by CitS fragments of increasing length, and the membrane topology was assessed by glycosylation of the Lep P2 domain (TableII). Extending the CitS fragment containing hydrophobic segment I with segment II (construct LCI-II) resulted in nonglycosylated molecules (Fig.3 A). Apparently, segment II is an efficient ST sequence (Fig. 3 B). Addition of segment III resulted again in glycosylated molecules (construct LCI-III, Fig.3 A), consistent with the formation of three transmembrane segments. Similarly, successive addition of segments IV and V resulted in nonglycosylated and glycosylated molecules, respectively, suggesting topologies with four and five transmembrane segments.Table IIMembrane topology of CitS fragments in the ER membraneConstructCitS residuesGlycosylationConstructCitS residuesGlycosylationConstructCitS residuesGlycosylationLocalization%%%LCI1–4675LumenalLCI-II1–740CytoplasmicLCI-III1–10585LumenalLCI-IV1–1420CytoplasmicLCI-V1–17560LumenalLCI-Vb1–19577LumenalLCI-VI1–2400CytoplasmicLCI-VII1–28778LCVII264–28790LumenalLCI-VIII1–3210LCVII-VIII264–32113CytoplasmicLCI-IX1–35755LCVII-IX264–35752LCIX334–35766LumenalLCI-X1–3890LCVII-X264–38918LCIXX̂334–38918CytoplasmicLCI-XI1–44672LCVII-XI264–446n.d.LCIXX̂I334–44660LumenalThe glycosylation of Lep constructs in which the H2 domain was replaced by the indicated CitS fragments was measured. Open table in a new tab The glycosylation of Lep constructs in which the H2 domain was replaced by the indicated CitS fragments was measured. Extension of the CitS fragment with the next hydrophobic segment, Vb, did not result in the formation of an additional transmembrane segment as evidenced by a high degree of glycosylation of construct LCI-Vb. Apparently, segment Vb does not have ST activity but instead is translocated to the lumen. This result is in accord with the topology study of CitS in E. coli (Fig. 1 B); fusion of PhoA to the COOH-terminal end of fragment I-Vb resulted in a periplasmic location of the PhoA moiety. As expected, construct LCI-VI was not glycosylated, indicating that one additional transmembrane segment is formed and that, most likely, segment Vb remains in the lumen. Addition of segment VII (LCI-VII) gave rise to efficiently glycosylated molecules, consistent with a total of seven transmembrane segments. Up to this point, the results are thus in full agreement with the PhoA topology model. Constructs LCI-VIII and LCI-IX (including the AH segment) were nonglycosylated and glycosylated, respectively, showing that in the ER membrane segments VIII and IX form a pair of transmembrane helices. This result is different from the PhoA studies in E. coli, where PhoA fusions between segments VII and X all resulted in periplasmic PhoA molecules. Finally, addition of segments X and XI (LCI-X and LCI-XI) resulted in nonglycosylated and glycosylated molecules, respectively, indicating that segments X and XI both span the membrane. We conclude that CitS spans the microsomal membrane 11 times and has one relatively hydrophobic loop (Vb) in the lumen (Fig.3 C). A series of Lep-CitS constructs was made to test the SA and ST function of various combinations of internal hydrophobic segments (Table II). Construct LCVII-VIII was not glycosylated, indicating that segments VII and VIII insert as a pair of transmembrane helices. The addition of segment IX (LCVII-IX) resulted in glycosylated molecules, consistent with the presence of three transmembrane segments. Successive addition of segments X and XI resulted in nonglycosylated and glycosylated molecules, respectively, again demonstrating membrane insertion of segments X and XI. Similarly, the insertion of the three COOH-terminal hydrophobic segments of CitS in the absence of the NH2-terminal part of the protein was studied. A construct containing segments IX and X (LCIX-X) was not glycosylated, indicating the formation of two transmembrane helices (Table II). As expected, the addition of segment XI gave rise to efficiently glycosylated molecules. In summary, successively adding the hydrophobic segments starting at segment VII or segment IX resulted in alternating glycosylated and nonglycosylated molecules in the same way as was observed in the presence of the NH2-terminal parts. Thus, COOH-terminal fragments insert independently of the upstream transmembrane segments. Segments V, Vb, and VI are each able to function as SA sequences when replacing H2 in Lep (Table I). On the other hand, segment Vb does not function as a ST sequence in the context of the COOH-terminally truncated constructs (Fig. 3). Similarly, a CitS fragment containing segments V and Vb (LCV-Vb) resulted in glycosylation of the P2 domain (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2). Because construct LCVb is partially cleaved by SPase whereas LCV is not (Fig. 2), the absence of SPase cleavage of LCV-Vb strongly suggests that it is segment V rather than Vb which spans the membrane in this construct. The addition of segment VI (LCV-VI) resulted in a cytoplasmic localization of the P2 domain (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 4). The results are the same as observed in the presence of the four NH2-terminal hydrophobic segments and indicate that the presence of segment V at the NH2-terminal side of Vb is enough to mediate the exclusion of Vb from the membrane,i.e. that Vb does not function as a ST sequence (Fig.4 B). As a further test of the ST activity of segment Vb, this segment was inserted in a different Lep construct designed to measure ST efficiency directly (28Sääf A. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This construct consists of the entire Lep molecule with two engineered glycosylation sites flanking two unique restriction sites in the P2 domain. If a segment encoding a ST sequence is cloned between the two glycosylation sites, only one of the two sites will be glycosylated; if the segment lacks ST activity, both sites will be modified (Fig. 4 C). Insertion of segment Vb between the two glycosylation sites resulted in mostly double-glycosylated molecules (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and 8), again demonstrating that segment Vb does not function efficiently as a ST sequence. To test whether the results obtained with segment Vb are related to the relatively low hydrophobicity of this fragment (Table I) the experiments were repeated with segment IX, which also has a relatively low hydrophobicity. Segment VIII is an efficient SA sequence (Table Iand Fig. 2). The addition of segment IX to VIII (LCVIII-IX) resulted in a low percentage of glycosylated molecules (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and2). Thus, in contrast to segments V and Vb, segments VIII and IX form a pair of transmembrane helices. When tested in the ST Lep construct, segment IX also displayed a much higher ST efficiency (i.e. a higher fraction of single-glycosylated molecules) than observed with fragment Vb (Fig. 5 A, lanes 7and 8). To test further whether the ST activity of segments Vb and IX is influenced by the NH2-terminal sequence preceding the segments, segments Vb and IX were exchanged in constructs LCV-Vb and LCVIII-IX resulting in the constructs LCVIII+Vb and LCV+IX. Also in the context of segment VIII, segment Vb does not exhibit any ST activity as indicated by a high percentage of glycosylated molecules (77%, Fig.4 A, lanes 5 and 6). Construct LCV+IX resulted in 40% glycosylated molecules, indicating that the ST activity of segment IX in this construct was significantly lower than in construct LCVIII-IX (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and6). A somewhat unexpected result was obtained when the fragment replacing H2 containing segments VIII and IX was extended with segment X. In this context, segment X apparently does not function as a SA sequence, as evidenced by the almost complete lack of glycosylation of the LCVIII-X construct (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). It should be noted, though, that segments VIII and IX are inserted in the opposite orientation compared with the wild type CitS in this construct. The CitS polypeptide contains 12 hydrophobic domains that are long and hydrophobic enough to be considered potential transmembrane helices. A PhoA fusion study in E. coli suggested that only 9 of these domains span the membrane, and 3 hydrophobic domains are located in the periplasm (23van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Such a topology would indicate a mechanism of insertion in the membrane more complex than a simple sequential insertion of the hydrophobic segments. In view of this result, we have sought to provide independent data on the topology and mode of insertion of CitS by studying its assembly into microsomal membranes. We have thus assayed the SA and ST function of each putative transmembrane segment, both as an individual fragment and in COOH- and NH2-terminally truncated CitS molecules. The different CitS fragments were introduced in place of the H2 transmembrane segment of Lep, and glycosylation of the P2 domain (see Fig. 1 C) was used as an indicator of membrane insertion. The insertion of Lep into the microsomal membrane has been studied extensively (31Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 33Gafvelin G. Sakaguchi M. Andersson H. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6119-6127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the H1 domain has an intrinsic ability to target to the ER membrane and to insert with the NH2 terminus in the lumen and that the orientation of the H1 segment is largely determined by the highly positively charged P1 loop. Because all the Lep-CitS constructs contain the H1 domain and the P1 loop, targeting the molecules to the membrane is mediated by H1, and the NH2-terminal end of the CitS fragment is located in the cytoplasm. Thus, we can study the “intrinsic” SA and ST function of various CitS fragments in molecules that have already been targeted to the microsomal membrane. In this respect, our approach differs from similar studies in which potential transmembrane domains are inserted in constructs without a preceding ER targeting sequence (10Bayle D. Weeks D. Sachs G.

All 12 hydrophobic domains of CitS were able to insert into the ER membrane when replacing the H2 domain of Lep, irrespective of their orientation in the wild type CitS protein. The SA activity of the hydrophobic domains given as percentage of glycosylation varied between 60 and 91% (Table I). There is no obvious correlation between the hydrophobicity of the segment and the degree of glycosylation. Similarly, the presence of additional positive or negative charges at the COOH-terminal side of the CitS fragment does not seem to affect SA function in any regular way (Table I). Most likely this is because of the highly positively charged P1 loop forcing the CitS segment to adopt a Ncyt-Clum orientation. A simple sequential insertion mechanism would predict that the individual hydrophobic segments insert one after the other in the membrane. Except for segment Vb, this was observed when segment I was successively extended with the following segments. Also, when segments VII and IX were extended with the downstream hydrophobic domains (TableII), a similar sequential insertion was observed, illustrating that NH2-terminal fragments of CitS are not required for the insertion of COOH-terminal fragments and that in these constructs the overall orientation of the segments is simply determined by the most NH2-terminal segment. Interestingly, while fully active as a SA sequence, segment Vb does not function as an efficient ST sequence in any of the constructs tested. The low ST function of Vb correlates with its rather low average hydrophobicity. However, the high ST activity of segment IX, which has an even lower hydrophobicity (Table I), suggests that current hydrophobicity scales do not fully predict ST function or that the specific amino acid sequence of a segment may play a role in ST activity (28Sääf A. Wallin E. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, the context of a segment seems to affect the ST function as well. Although segment Vb lacks detectable ST activity when preceded by segment V or VIII (Fig. 4 A), it does exhibit low but significant ST activity when placed in the middle of the P2 domain. Similarly, the ST activity of segment IX is significantly lower in construct V+IX than observed in construct VIII-IX or in the P2 domain (Fig. 5 A). The insertion behavior of the CitS fragment comprising hydrophobic segments VIII, IX, and X demonstrates that the same fragment may insert differently in the membrane depending on the orientation. In the normal situation in the CitS molecule, the NH2 terminus of segment VIII is on the lumenal side of the membrane, and the three segments insert sequentially (Fig. 3 C). When the NH2terminus of segment VIII is forced to the cytoplasmic side, segment VIII functions as a SA sequence, and the addition of segment IX results in a pair of transmembrane helices (Fig. 5 B). However, when segment X is added, the fragment adopts either one of the two topologies indicated in Fig. 5 B with only two membrane spans. The exclusion of segment Vb from the membrane and the unexpected topology of the LCVIII-X construct suggest that the topogenesis of a membrane protein is not determined simply by the presence of hydrophobic domains but is a controlled process in which the destination of a hydrophobic segment is influenced by the context of the segment in the protein and the orientation in the membrane,i.e. whether it acts as a SA or a ST sequence. Probably, interactions between different parts of the nascent chain and the ribosome and/or the translocation machinery (11Do H. Falcons D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Brunner J. Rapoport T.A.

Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) determine the destination of the hydrophobic segments. The present study indicates that CitS traverses the microsomal membrane 11 times (Fig. 3 C), whereas a study in E. colisuggested a model with only 9 transmembrane segments (Fig.1 B). Both studies make use of COOH-terminally truncated CitS molecules to which a topological marker was fused. Nevertheless, although in both models segment Vb is translocated across the membrane, segments VIII and IX form a transmembrane helix pair in the ER membrane but seem to have a periplasmic location in E. coli, despite the high hydrophobicity of segment VIII. Possibly, both models are correct, i.e. the bacterial and ER insertion machinery interpret the topological information in the nascent chain in a different way, resulting in two CitS proteins with different folding (see also Ref. 37Hegde R.S. Voigt S. Lingappa V.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two insertion machineries deal differently with the truncated proteins because different reporter molecules were used (PhoA or P2) or because in the bacterial system COOH-terminal sequences are required for proper insertion of segment VIII, whereas this would be less critical in the ER system. It should be noted that the model with 11 transmembrane segments conforms better to the hydrophobicity profile and to the so-called “positive inside” rule (32von Heijne G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 167-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).

Results from binding assays examining the activity of various EbpS fragments suggested that the elastin recognition domain is contained within the first 59 amino acids. In this report, we have used functional analyses with synthetic peptides and recombinant truncated forms of EbpS to localize the elastin binding domain to a 21-amino acid region contained within residues 14–34 of EbpS.

Overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to EbpS residues 14–36 were then generated and tested for elastin binding activity to define further the elastin binding domain, and results from these studies showed that sequences spanning amino acids Gln14-Asp23, Asp17-Asp23, and Thr18-Glu34 inhibit binding ofStaphylococcus aureus to elastin. Our analyses indicate that the hexameric sequence Thr18-Asn-Ser-His-Gln-Asp23 is the minimal sequence common to all active synthetic peptides, proteolytic fragments, and recombinant constructs of EbpS.

Molecular interactions between ECM components and corresponding cell-surface receptors instruct cells to differentiate, migrate, adhere, or proliferate in directing these biological processes. Although there are exceptions, mammalian cells typically use the integrins, an α/β heterodimeric receptor complex, to interact with the ECM (4Hynes R.O.

Bacterial pathogens also interact with the host matrix through specific cell-surface ECM-binding molecules categorized collectively as adhesins or microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules (3Patti J.M.

The Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has been found to interact with many ECM macromolecules such as collagen (7Holderbaum D. Hall G.S. Ehrhart L.A. Infect.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Staphylococcal ECM adhesins do not have endogenous bacterial ligands and in general are thought to be used to assist in colonization of host tissues. For example, collagen (14Patti J.M. Bremell T. Krajewska-Pietrasik D. Abdelnour A. Tarkowski A. Rydén C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and fibronectin (15Baddour L.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2143-2148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) adhesin mutants show a reduced capacity to cause disease in in vivo models but are otherwise phenotypically normal. At the molecular level, all characterized staphylococcal adhesins function as monomers. Available evidence suggests that ligand-binding sites in staphylococcal ECM adhesins are contained within small regions of the extracellular domain. The ligand-binding site in the staphylococcal fibronectin adhesin, for example, has been mapped to a repetitive 38-amino acid motif, and synthetic peptides containing this sequence have been found to possess direct binding activity and to inhibit bacterial binding to fibronectin (16Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 17Raja R.H. Raucci G. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2593-2598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a synthetic 25-amino acid peptide corresponding to the region between Asp209 and Tyr233 of the collagen adhesin has been shown to inhibit binding of type II collagen to S. aureus (18Patti J.M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12005-12011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that this short peptide sequence alone can mediate staphylococcal binding to collagen. In a previous study, we showed that specific binding between S. aureus and elastin was mediated by a 25-kDa elastin-binding protein on the surface of S. aureus (EbpS) (13Park P.W. Roberts D.D. Grosso L.E. Parks W.C. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elastin binding activity was localized to the extracellular, amino-terminal end of EbpS within the first 59 amino acids (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To better define the amino acids in EbpS responsible for the elastin binding activity, we have used overlapping synthetic peptides and truncated recombinant EbpS constructs in elastin binding assays. Our results demonstrate that the critical elastin recognition sequence within the amino-terminal domain resides between Gln14 and Glu34. Sequence comparison indicates that the minimal sequence shared by all active EbpS constructs is the hexamer Thr-Asn-Ser-His-Gln-Asp spanning residues 18–23. Restriction enzymes, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, T4 DNA ligase, isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside, andHindIII-digested λDNA markers were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI).

Papain and protein A immobilized to cross-linked agarose, Immunopure Sulfo-NHS-Biotinylation kit, and IODO-GEN were purchased from Pierce. QIAexpress vector kit type IV and the midi-prep plasmid purification kit were obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Nitrocellulose membrane and blotting paper were from Schleicher & Schuell. Affi-Gel 10 affinity support was from Bio-Rad (Melville, NY).S. aureus strain 12598 (Cowan) was purchased from the ATCC and used throughout this study. All other materials were purchased from Sigma. Synthetic peptides containing the deduced primary sequence of EbpS were prepared in our laboratory by conventional solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems model 431A synthesizer using FastMoc chemistry. Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Beckman C18, 0–80% linear water/acetonitrile gradient containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). Purity of the peptides was confirmed by either amino-terminal sequencing or electron spray mass spectrometry. All synthetic peptides were soluble in the assay buffer at the concentrations tested. Expression of full-length recombinant EbpS (rEbpS) as a fusion protein with a polyhistidine tag at the amino terminus was as described previously (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Essentially the same protocol was followed to make truncated recombinant EbpS-1 and -2 (trEbpS-1 and trEbpS-2), except that different PCR primers were used. For the generation of trEbpS-1 containing EbpS residues 1–78, a 2.6-kilobase pairHindIII/HincII cloned fragment in pBluescript KS+ which contains full-length ebpS (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using the oligonucleotide 5′-TGTGGATCCATAGAAAGGAAGGTGGCTGTG-3′ as the forward primer and the oligonucleotide 5′-CATTGAGCTCAGATGTTTGTGATTC-3′ as the reverse primer. To make trEbpS-2 corresponding to amino acid residues 1–34 of EbpS, the same template and forward primer were used, whereas the oligonucleotide 5′-GTTCGAGCTCTGATTGGTCTTTTTC-3′ served as the reverse primer. The forward primer contained a BamHI site (underlined), and A of the two ATG codons was changed to G (in bold letters) to avoid internal initiation of translation as recommended by Qiagen. The reverse primers contained a SacI cleavage site (underlined). PCR amplification was performed with a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler using standard reagents. Conditions for PCR amplification and subsequent restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, transformation, expression, and purification of recombinant proteins were as described previously (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). trEbpS-1 and trEbpS-2 were biotinylated using a commercially available kit (Pierce). Recombinant proteins (1 mg) were incubated with sulfo-NHS-biotin reagent (2 mg) in 1 ml of PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. Biotinylated proteins were then separated from free biotinylating reagent by PD-10 (G-25) gel filtration chromatography. Three micrograms of recombinant human tropoelastin and bovine serum albumin were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting. Transferred blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer that contained 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The blots were washed twice with blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either 5 μm biotinylated trEbpS-1 or -2 in the absence or presence of 3 mg/ml elastin peptides in blocking buffer. After washing twice with blocking buffer, the blots were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were developed by 4-chloro-naphthol. Immunization protocols and characterization of the anti-EbpS polyclonal antibodies have been described previously (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To subtract the population of antibodies recognizing EbpS residues 1–34, anti-EbpS IgGs (25 mg) purified by caprylic acid precipitation (20McKinney M.M. Parkinson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with trEbpS-2 (8 mg) coupled to 3 ml of Affi-Gel 10. On the following day, the mixture was transferred to a disposable polypropylene column, and unbound IgGs were collected by gravity flow. The efficiency of the absorption was tested by Western immunoblotting against the full-length and two truncated constructs of recombinant EbpS (Fig. 2 C). Fab fragments from both the original and trEbpS-2-absorbed IgG fractions were prepared by digestion with immobilized papain as described previously (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Purification and radiolabeling of full-length recombinant human soluble tropoelastin, generation of elastin peptides, cellular elastin binding assays, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting were performed as described previously (13Park P.W. Roberts D.D. Grosso L.E. Parks W.C. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23399-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Automated amino acid sequencing was performed in our laboratory using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. Electron spray mass spectrometry was performed by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, MO). The PROTEAN program (DNAStar, Madison, WI) was used to predict the secondary structure of EbpS constructs. Results from our previous studies examining elastin binding properties of various EbpS fragments (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and recombinant constructs are summarized in Fig.1. A cyanogen bromide fragment containing the first 125 amino acids of EbpS showed binding activity, whereas an EbpS degradation product lacking the first 59 amino acids, a cyanogen bromide fragment containing the carboxyl-terminal one-third of the protein, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 1–13 did not interact with elastin. These results suggested that the elastin-binding site in EbpS is contained in amino acid residues 14–59 (shaded area in Fig. 1). To identify the domain in EbpS critical for binding, two truncated recombinant constructs of EbpS (trEbpS-1 and trEbpS-2) were generated and tested for their ability to bind directly to elastin and to inhibit binding of S. aureus to elastin. trEbpS-1, with a predicted molecular mass of 12.8 kDa, contains residues 1–78 of EbpS, whereas trEbpS-2 spans residues 1–34 and has a predicted mass of 7.5 kDa. Characterization of the truncated constructs by mass spectrometry, peptide microsequencing, and immunoblotting with the anti-rEbpS antibody (Fig. 2 B, lanes C andD) confirmed that correct truncated proteins have been expressed. Upon resuspension in a physiological buffer for analysis, trEbpS-1 appeared to have been degraded as evident from the two bands seen in Fig. 2. Another notable property of the two truncated EbpS proteins is that they migrated at higher than their predicted molecular mass when fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). This behavior has also been observed with full-length recombinant EbpS (rEbpS) (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For reasons not fully understood, aberrant migration in SDS-PAGE appears to be a common characteristic of Gram-positive cell-surface proteins (12McDevitt D. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Foster T.J. Mol.

Timmis K.N. Chhatwal G.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine whether trEbpS-1 and -2 bind directly to elastin, the truncated proteins were biotinylated and reacted with tropoelastin that was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. As shown in Fig.3, both truncated constructs bound to the 67-kDa tropoelastin in the absence (lanes A andC), but not in the presence (lanes B andD), of competing soluble elastin peptides. The biotinylated proteins did not bind to bovine serum albumin under similar conditions (data not shown), supporting the specificity of the tropoelastin-binding interaction. A 45-kDa band also reacted with the two biotinylated trEbpS constructs. This binding, however, was observed in all lanes of the Western ligand blot indicating that this interaction is nonspecific. Effects of trEbpS proteins on elastin binding at the cellular level were tested by incubating S. aureus cells with radiolabeled elastin in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of either soluble full-length (rEbpS) or truncated forms of the adhesin. All three proteins inhibited binding of S. aureus cells to elastin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4). rEbpS and trEbpS-1 completely inhibited elastin binding at the highest concentration tested. trEbpS-2 was somewhat less effective as an inhibitor, with about 20% residual elastin binding activity at the highest inhibitor concentration. We have previously shown that Fab fragments of a polyclonal antibody raised against rEbpS inhibit binding ofS. aureus to elastin (19Park P.W. Rosenbloom J. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15803-15809Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that a population of antibodies in the immune IgG recognizes a region in EbpS critical for elastin binding. To test this possibility, anti-rEbpS IgGs were absorbed to the trEbpS-2 construct coupled to Affi-Gel 10, and unbound IgGs were collected. Immunoblotting revealed that the unbound immunoglobulins (trEbpS-2 negative) retained the ability to interact with full-length rEbpS and trEbpS-1 (Fig. 2 C, lanes B andC), although with reduced activity toward trEbpS-1. As expected, the trEbpS-2-negative immunoglobulin fraction that was not absorbed to the trEbpS-2 construct did not react with trEbpS-2 on Western blot (Fig. 2 C, lane D). Fab fragments from both the original and trEbpS-2-negative IgGs were generated by papain digestion and tested for their effects on staphylococcal elastin binding. Consistent with previous findings, Fab fragments from the original anti-rEbpS IgGs abrogated binding ofS. aureus to elastin (Fig. 5). In contrast, Fab fragments from the trEbpS-2-negative IgGs did not inhibit S. aureus binding to elastin at the highest concentration tested (500 μg/ml). The findings described above suggest that the elastin recognition domain in EbpS is contained within residues 14–34. To define more precisely the elastin binding domain, overlapping synthetic peptides within this region were generated (Fig.6) and tested for their ability to inhibit staphylococcal elastin binding. We first searched for repetitive sequences in EbpS as a candidate elastin binding domain since several staphylococcal and streptococcal ECM adhesins have been shown to use repetitive domains for ligand recognition (16Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 22Sela S. Aviv A. Tovi A. Burstein I. Caparon M.G. Hanski E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although no identical repetitive sequences were identified, there are two related sequences, 21HQDHTEDVE29 and37HQDTIENTE45, in the amino-terminal end of the molecule. The sequence 21HQDHTEDVE29 is within the putative amino-terminal elastin-binding site and is contained in all active EbpS constructs. The second sequence,37HQDTIENTE45, is present only in full-length EbpS and trEbpS-1, which are the most efficient elastin-binding constructs of EbpS. To determine whether the HQDHTEDVE sequence might participate in elastin binding, we generated two synthetic 17 amino acid peptides, P1 and P2, corresponding to residues 18–34 (Fig. 6). The P1 peptide was made according to the deduced sequence of EbpS. In the P2 peptide, Asp23, Glu26, and Glu29 were substituted with Asn, Pro, and Gln, respectively. The charged amino acids were targeted for substitution because staphylococcal elastin binding has been shown to involve electrostatic interactions (25Park P.W. Interactions between Elastin and Staphylococcus. Washington University, St. Louis, MO1993Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the P1 peptide inhibited S. aureus binding to elastin in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.4 mm, whereas the P2 peptide failed to inhibit elastin binding (IC50 = >1.3 mm). To define the elastin binding domain more completely, three overlapping 10-mers spanning amino acid residues 14–36 were generated (Fig. 6) and tested for their ability to inhibit S. aureus binding to elastin. Peptide P4 (residues 21–30) containing the HQDHTEDVE sequence and the P5 peptide (residues 27–36) only reduced elastin binding by approximately 35% at the highest concentration tested, whereas the P3 peptide (residues 14–23) inhibited binding of S. aureus to radiolabeled elastin by more than 95% in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the HQDHTEDVE sequence does not represent the elastin binding domain of EbpS. IC50 values obtained from these experiments for P3, P4, and P5 were 0.7, >1.6, and >2.1 mm, respectively (Fig. 6). Sequence comparison of P3 and other active EbpS constructs revealed that the hexapeptide 18TNSHQD23 is the only sequence shared by all active constructs. However, the hexapeptide TNSHQD (P6) and its control TNSHQS (P7) did not inhibit staphylococcal elastin binding at any concentration tested (0.1–3.0 mm). These findings suggest that although the presence of the TNSHQD sequence is essential for elastin binding by EbpS, additional flanking amino acids are required for its activity. Furthermore, abrogation of activity in the P1 peptide by substitution of Asp23 to Asn, Glu26 to Pro, and Glu29 to Gln suggests that the carboxyl side chain of Asp23 is critical for elastin recognition if the 18TNSHQD23 hexapeptide indeed plays an important role in elastin recognition. To test these hypotheses, we generated synthetic peptides P8 corresponding to the wild type EbpS sequence spanning residues 14–25, P9 with Asp17 in P8 substituted with Asn, P10 with Asp23 in P8 substituted with Asn, P11 with 1 amino acid added to TNSHQD in the amino-terminal direction, P12 as a scrambled peptide control of P9, and P13 with 2 residues added to TNSHQD in the carboxyl-terminal direction and tested for their ability to inhibit staphylococcal elastin binding (Fig. 6). Both peptides P8 and P9 inhibited staphylococcal elastin binding in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 0.8 and 1.0 mm, respectively. However, the P10 peptide with Asn substituted for Asp23 failed to inhibit binding (IC50 = >4.3 mm), demonstrating the importance of a charged amino acid at this location. The P11 peptide showed concentration-dependent inhibition of binding with an IC50 of 0.9 mm, although both its scrambled control (P12) and P13 were inactive (Fig. 6). These results indicate that more than two flanking amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal direction are required to make the TNSHQD hexapeptide active, whereas addition of one residue in the amino-terminal direction is sufficient to render specific elastin binding activity to the hexamer TNSHQD. ECM adhesins are important for bacterial colonization of and dissemination through host tissues. To understand better the mechanism of S. aureus adhesion to elastin, we sought to identify the elastin binding domain in EbpS, the cell-surface elastin-binding protein of S. aureus. By using overlapping EbpS fragments, polyclonal anti-EbpS antibodies, and recombinant constructs, we mapped the elastin binding domain in EbpS to the extracellular amino-terminal region of the molecule. Two truncated recombinant constructs spanning EbpS residues 1–34 and 1–78 inhibited staphylococcal elastin binding. When the polyclonal anti-EbpS antibody, previously shown to inhibitS. aureus binding to elastin, was absorbed to the trEbpS-2 protein spanning residues 1–34, the antibody lost its inhibitory activity. These findings further localized the elastin binding domain in EbpS to residues 14–34. Eleven overlapping synthetic peptides spanning amino acids 14–36 were then used to define better the elastin binding domain in EbpS. Among these, only peptides corresponding to residues 14–23, 17–23, and 18–34 of EbpS specifically inhibited elastin binding by more than 95%. Our analyses revealed that the hexameric sequence Thr18-Asn-Ser-His-Gln-Asp23 is the only sequence common to all active synthetic peptides, proteolytic fragments, and recombinant constructs of EbpS. Further evidence that this sequence is important for elastin binding was the loss of activity when Asp23 was substituted with Asn in the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 14–25 and 18–34. Interestingly, the synthetic hexamer TNSHQD by itself did not inhibit staphylococcal binding to elastin. These findings suggest that although the presence of the TNSHQD sequence is essential for EbpS activity, flanking amino acids in the amino- or carboxyl-terminal direction and the carboxyl side chain of Asp23 are required for elastin recognition. A survey of the active synthetic EbpS peptides showed that four (P1, P3, P8, and P11) are strongly acidic (pI ≤5.1). This finding raised the possibility of nonspecific inhibition in which any peptide with two or more strongly acidic amino acid residues, such as Asp and Glu, can interact with elastin. Our results, however, show that the highly negatively charged P5 and P12 peptides (pI = 3.7 and 3.9, respectively) are inactive, excluding the possibility that elastin binding is simply or solely a consequence of strong negative charge. More importantly, our results show that the elastin binding domain is sequence-specific in that the scrambled peptide P12, which is a control for P11, the shortest functional elastin binding sequence, is inactive. The minimal requirements for elastin recognition by EbpS are surprisingly similar to what has been observed for the interaction between S. aureus and fibronectin. Fibronectin binding toS. aureus is mediated by a surface fibronectin-binding protein, and the fibronectin-binding site in this adhesin has been mapped to an extracellular 38-amino acid motif repeated three times and partially a fourth time (16Signäs C. Raucci G. Jönsson K. Lindgren P. Anantharamaiah G.M. Höök M. Lindberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A subsequent investigation by McGavinet al. (26McGavin M.J. Raucci G. Gurusiddappa S. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8343-8347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that essential amino acids are contained within residues 21–33 of the 38-amino acid motif and that flanking amino- and carboxyl-terminal amino acids are required for activity. The carboxyl side chains of acidic amino acids are also essential. These authors suggested that the flanking residues are required to acquire a conformation that is favorable for fibronectin binding. Similar to the ligand recognition mechanism of the staphylococcal fibronectin adhesin protein, the TNSHQD hexamer by itself could be inactive because it folds improperly, and flanking residues are required to form a conformation that is necessary for efficient activity. This might explain why affinities of active EbpS synthetic peptides for binding to elastin are considerably lower than those of larger elastin-binding EbpS constructs. Although the three-dimensional structure of EbpS is still unknown, the amino-terminal region of full-length EbpS is predicted to fold into amphipathic α-helices (Eisenberg method, PROTEAN program) except for regions including residues 14–23 which is where the TNSHQD sequence resides. These predictions may imply that the flanking residues in EbpS are required to stabilize the flexible binding domain containing the TNSHQD sequence for interaction with the ligand elastin. A similar mechanism has been found to be utilized by integrins and their matrix ligands in that the integrin-binding site in the ligands consist of short peptide sequences presented on flexible loops between β-strands (27Loftus J.C. Liddinton R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinities of the short integrin-binding peptides are considerably lower than those of intact ligands as with our short elastin-binding EbpS peptides. We are in the process of determining the crystal structure of EbpS to study directly whether the TNSHQD epitope is indeed stabilized by flanking α-helical domains and to define the elastin recognition sequence. The properties of staphylococcal elastin and fibronectin recognition mechanisms appear to be opposite that of their corresponding mammalian receptors. Mammalian receptors bind to their respective ligands through the interaction of structural domains in the receptor and a short contiguous peptide sequence in the ligand. Structural domains formed by both the α and β integrin subunits (27Loftus J.C. Liddinton R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), for example, interact with short peptide sequences such as RGD (28Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar), LDV (29Mould A.P. Wheldon L.A. Komoriya A. Wayner E.A. Yamada K.M. Humphries M.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, the 67-kDa mammalian elastin-binding protein recognizes the hydrophobic VGVAPG hexapeptide sequence in elastin (32Hinek A. Wrenn D.S. Mecham R.P. Barondes S.H. Science. 1988; 239: 1539-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In contrast, staphylococcal elastin and fibronectin adhesins appear to interact with their ligands by fitting a small region of the adhesin stabilized by flanking residues into a structural binding pocket formed by the ligand. For example, the staphylococcal binding domain in fibronectin is a structural domain that requires all five type I modules in the amino-terminal region for binding (33Sottile J. Schwarzbauer J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12840-12843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that these differences in ligand recognition mechanisms may be important for pathogenesis in ensuring a lack of binding competition between the staphylococcal and mammalian elastin and fibronectin binding systems, thus promoting efficient binding of staphylococci to host tissue components for colonization and dissemination. The different strategy in receptor-ligand recognition used by S. aureus also raises the interesting possibility that other elastin-binding proteins may use a similar approach for interacting with elastin. Sequence comparisons, however, failed to detect the TNSHQD sequence in several known elastin-binding proteins, including pancreatic and neutrophil elastases (34Fletcher T.S. Shen W. Largman C.

Furthermore, none of these proteins showed significant homology to the extended elastin-binding EbpS sequence corresponding to residues 14–34. The exact sequence in elastin recognized by EbpS is still unknown, although previous studies with recombinant tropoelastin fragments have localized the recognition sequence to the amino-terminal one-third of the protein (13Park P.W.

A possible binding domain in this amino-terminal region has been suggested by peptide antibody inhibition experiments 2P. W. Park, T. J. Broekelmann, B. R. Mecham, and R. P. Mecham, unpublished results. to lie within a sequence that is encoded by exons 9 and 10. Interestingly, this domain contains a conserved Arg residue that may be critical for interaction with the essential Asp23 in EbpS. Further studies are in progress to characterize better this domain."

That cIP is also a substrate (K m = ∼15 mm) implies a two-step mechanism (intramolecular phosphotransferase reaction to form cIP followed by cyclic phosphodiesterase activity to form inositol-1-phosphate (I-1-P)). PI is cleaved by PI-PLCγ1 to form cIP and I-1-P with the enzyme specific activity and ratio of products (cIP/I-1-P) regulated by assay temperature, pH, Ca2+, and other amphiphilic additives. Cleavage of both cIP and PI by the enzyme is optimal at pH 5. The effect of Ca2+ on PI-PLCγ1 activity is unique compared with other isozymes enzymes: Ca2+ is necessary for the activity and low Ca2+activates the enzyme; however, high Ca2+ inhibits PI-PLCγ1 hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (but not cIP) with the extent of inhibition dependent on pH, substrate identity (cIP or PI), substrate presentation (e.g. detergent matrix), and substrate surface concentration. This inhibition of PI-PLCγ1 by high Ca2+ is proposed to derive from the divalent metal ion-inducing clustering of the PI and reducing its accessibility to the enzyme. Amphiphilic additives such as phosphatidic acid, fatty acid, and sodium dodecylsulfate enhance PI cleavage in micelles at pH 7.5 but not at pH 5.0; they have no effect on cIP hydrolysis at either pH value. These different kinetic patterns are used to propose a model for regulation of the enzyme. A key hypothesis is that there is a pH-dependent conformational change in the enzyme that controls accessibility of the active site to both water-soluble cIP and interfacially organized PI. The low activity enzyme at pH 7.5 can be activated by PA (or phosphorylation by tyrosine kinase). However, this activation requires lipophilic substrate (PI) present because cIP hydrolysis is not enhanced in the presence of PA.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These enzymes are subdivided into three main classes, PI-PLC-β, -γ, and -δ, that share three conserved regions (3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (these domains often have a high affinity for the phosphoinositide PIP2), (ii) the X domain (∼170 amino acids), and (iii) the Y domain (∼260 amino acids). A C2 or Ca2+-lipid binding domain is also present at the C-terminal end of PI-PLC-γ and -δ. In all cases, the X and Y domains are necessary for catalysis (4Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the other domains involved in regulating activity. For example, in the case of PI-PLC-δ, the PH domain plays an allosteric role in binding the protein to a bilayer (5Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.-F. Wang L.-P. Kuan Y.-S. Liu S.-M. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PH domains also bind βγ G proteins very tightly (6Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and PI-PLC-β activity is regulated by interactions with Gqproteins (7Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.O.

The biological significance of the PI-PLCγ1 enzyme has been documented (2Kamat A. Carpenter G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When PI-PLCγ1 was “knocked out” of mice by targeted gene disruption (9Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the embryos failed to develop beyond 9 days. The lethality was not due to a specific organ failure but to a general lack of growth in all parts of the embryo. Thus, in an intact mammal PI-PLCγ1 is indispensable for cell proliferation, and the requirement is not compensated for by other signal transduction pathways or other PI-PLC isozymes. The enzymes are activated by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (10Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G.

A unique feature of PI-PLCγ isozymes that distinguishes them from the β and δ classes is that the extended sequence between the X and Y domains is homologous to Src domains. These SH2 and SH3 domains can interact with protein tyrosine kinases and activate the enzyme (10Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G.

Flanking these Src homology domains is a split PH domain as well. Deletion of SH2 and SH3 domains produces an enzyme that still has catalytic activity but altered regulation (14Emori Y. Homma Y. Sorimachi H. Kawasaki H. Nakanishi O. Suzuki K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21885-21890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the X and Y domains in tandem leads to a folded structure that has a 20-fold higher activity toward PI and now has optimum activity at pH 7 (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Given the structural complexity of this protein, kinetic studies with well defined substrates can shed light on the roles and importance of the different domains for the actual catalytic cleavage of PI. Although purified PI-PLCγ1 exhibits a moderate preference for PIP2as substrate (3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can hydrolyze PI efficiently yielding both cIP and I-1-P as products. In the present work we have focused on characterizing the activity of PI-PLCγ1 toward the water-soluble substrate cIP as well as on PI/detergent mixed micelles. As was observed for PI-PLCδ1 (16Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochem istry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), cIP is a substrate for PI-PLCγ1, and examining how nonsubstrate amphiphiles affect kinetic parameters is useful in assessing how interfacial modulation of the protein affects this catalytic step. Although PI-PLCγ1 kinetics show some similarity with PI-PLCδ1, there are critical differences. In particular, the observation of higher specific activity at pH 5 toward both water-soluble cIP and PI, inhibition of PI cleavage by Ca2+concentrations in excess of a critical threshold, the lack of surface or organic solvent activation of the enzyme toward cIP, PA activation toward PI (but not cIP) at pH >6, and changes in the ratio of product cIP to I-1-P by temperature, pH, Ca2+, or other additives provide insights into how this enzyme could be regulated in vivo.DISCUSSIONMammalian PI-PLC isozymes are multidomain enzymes with key roles in signal transduction by virtue of their generation of second messengers by substrate cleavage. A recurring theme is that their action can be modulated by interfaces interacting with several different domains (PH, C2, SH2, and SH3). Distinguishing kinetic enhancements caused by changes in surface properties from those caused by allosteric effects on k cat is often difficult with a phospholipid substrate. However, hydrolysis of cIP, the water-soluble intermediate in the cleavage of PI, can be used as a probe of allosteric effects of interfaces on PI-PLC enzymes. The highK m of several PI-PLC enzymes for cIP compared with PI suggests that an interfacial substrate binds more effectively to the enzyme. Coupled with water-miscible organic solvent activation in the case of bacterial PI-PLC and PI-PLCδ1, the high K mfor cIP is likely to reflect difficulties in the enzyme binding a well hydrated polar molecule. In striking contrast to those PLCs, PI-PLCγ1 is more efficient in hydrolyzing cIP and does not exhibit solvent activation. Because cIP structure is the same, the lowerK m for cIP, lack of cooperativity in cIP binding, and higher V max of PI-PLCγ1 may reflect a local decreased polarity at the active site. Another key kinetic difference involves PH domains. The N-terminal PH domain of PI-PLCδ1 was shown to interact allosterically with amphiphiles (PC or PIP2), causing a 2-fold increase ink cat toward cIP (16Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochem istry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Roberts M.F. Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Bruzik K.S. Phosphoinositides: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biomedical Applications. 718. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1998: 137-157Google Scholar). PI-PLCγ1 has both an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain between the X and Y domains. Although there is significant sequence homology between the PH domains of δ1 and γ1 isozymes, functional similarity is less obvious because there was no effect of PC or other interfaces (including PIP2 solubilized in TX-100 or diC7PC micelles) on the cyclic phosphodiesterase reaction of PI-PLCγ1. The PH domain of PI-PLCγ1 could still aid in anchoring the enzyme to an interface; however, such interactions do not affect the catalytic machinery.PI cleavage by PI-PLCγ1 generates both cIP and I-1-P in parallel. Given the kinetic parameters for cIP hydrolysis (which predict a build-up of cIP prior to I-1-P generation), PI-PLCγ1 is similar to the δ1 isozyme where the E·cIP complex has a relatively long lifetime. Because PI-PLCγ1 also requires Ca2+ for activity, the cIP may have a binding orientation at the active site similar to that for a nonhydrolyzable cIP analog (27Wu Y. Zhou C. Roberts M.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), where the phosphonate is a bidentate ligand of the active site Ca2+. This arrangement would stabilize E·cIP. However, Ca2+ has another more complex effect on the phosphotransferase activity of PI-PLCγ1 toward PI. Above a threshold concentration, Ca2+ inhibits the first step of the reaction; the cyclic phosphodiesterase step is not inhibited by high Ca2+. The lack of effect on water-soluble cIP is consistent with the Ca2+ affecting properties of the lipid substrate (e.g. Ca2+-induced PI clustering) and not the enzyme. Alternatively, if one invokes a secondary Ca2+ site on the enzyme, then its occupation affects the phosphotransferase step but not the cIP hydrolysis step. However, because additional nonsubstrate interfacial molecules (that do not affect cIP hydrolysis) reduce the high Ca2+ inhibition, the most reasonable explanation is that high Ca2+ alters substrate-Ca2+ interactions, and these changes inhibit PI-PLCγ1.The pH dependence for PI-PLCγ1 action on PI and cIP (roughly a 20-fold higher activity at pH 5 than 7) is also unusual and has mechanistic implications. One or more key residues must be protonated for optimal activity of both phosphotransferase and cyclic phosphodiesterase activities of the full-length enzyme. Interestingly, expression of X and Y domains without the SH2 or SH3 inserted domains yields a highly active enzyme whose pH optimum is shifted to 7 (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A possible model for the pH dependence of PI-PLCγ1 (Fig.8) has the active site of PI-PLCγ1 covered or occluded by the SH2-SH2-SH3 domains at pH 7; this “lid” or cover would be displaced at pH 5 by protonation of key residues (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At pH 5, this SH2-SH2-SH3 lid is “open” and PI-PLCγ1 activity is high; at pH 7, the lid is “closed” and the enzyme has much lower activity. Consistent with this model is the previous observation that protease V8 cleavage activates the enzyme at pH 7, and the cleavage occurs within the lid between the SH3 and Y domains (28Fernald A.W. Jones G.A. Carpenter G. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Active enzyme at pH 5 can be inhibited by excess Ca2+sequestering the substrate PI; this kinetic effect depends on the detergent matrix used to solubilize PI. Ca2+ modulation of the TX-100-PI interface also occurs at pH 7.The addition of anionic lipids (PA, LPA, SDS, and oleic acid) also affects the pH profile, enhancing enzyme activity at pH 7.5. The mechanism for the altered hydrolysis of PI could be due to the amphiphiles interacting with either the enzyme or the substrate. One possible explanation is that anionic lipids bind to the enzyme and open the SH2-SH2-SH3 lid. Their presence should enhance both PI and cIP cleavage at pH 7.5. Because only activity toward PI is enhanced, substrate PI must also be needed to facilitate lid opening at pH 7. Alternatively, activation by PA and similar lipids could be the result of altered substrate properties. The anionic amphiphiles could compete with PI and lessen Ca2+-induced aggregation of substrate. However, that is unlikely to account for (i) the very large activation observed at pH 7.5 and (ii) the observation of the same magnitude of PA activation with PI solubilized in diC7PC and TX-100 micelles (the TX-100 surface is much more susceptible to Ca2+-induced clustering than the PC/PI surface, hence one would expect a difference in the behavior of these two interfaces with PA added). The pK a2 of micellar PA or LPA (either short chain PA or long chain PA in TX-100 micelles) is ∼7 (29Garigapati V.R. Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 486-492Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The significant activation of PI-PLCγ1 around this value in the presence of PA suggests that the PA dianion is critical for this effect. PI-PLCγ1 is regulated in vivo by phosphorylation (30Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 31Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation might be another switch that alters the interaction of the SH domains with the rest of the protein leading to activation of PI-PLCγ1 at pH 7. Precedence for such interactions can be seen with the SHP-2 structure (32Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This offers the possibility of proteins modulating PI-PLCγ1 activity by interacting with the SH domains and opening the (hypothetical) lid.In summary, a model consistent with unusual kinetics of PI-PLCγ1 toward both water-soluble cIP and interfacially organized PI has been proposed. It includes specific enzyme conformational changes due to pH or nonsubstrate ligands as well as Ca2+-induced modulation of interfacial substrate properties as ways to alter enzyme specific activity. The model shown in Fig. 8 also makes several predictions that can be tested in the future: (i) there should be a large conformational change (presumably involving the SH domains) in the enzyme between pH 5 and 7 and (ii) because phosphonate esters have pK avalues shifted from phosphate esters, a phosphono-PA analog would be expected to activate the enzyme but alter the pH profile of PI hydrolysis in the presence of PA.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These enzymes are subdivided into three main classes, PI-PLC-β, -γ, and -δ, that share three conserved regions (3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): (i) an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (these domains often have a high affinity for the phosphoinositide PIP2), (ii) the X domain (∼170 amino acids), and (iii) the Y domain (∼260 amino acids). A C2 or Ca2+-lipid binding domain is also present at the C-terminal end of PI-PLC-γ and -δ. In all cases, the X and Y domains are necessary for catalysis (4Grobler J.A. Hurley J.H. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with the other domains involved in regulating activity. For example, in the case of PI-PLC-δ, the PH domain plays an allosteric role in binding the protein to a bilayer (5Lomasney J.W. Cheng H.-F. Wang L.-P. Kuan Y.-S. Liu S.-M. Fesik S.W. King K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25316-25326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). PH domains also bind βγ G proteins very tightly (6Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), and PI-PLC-β activity is regulated by interactions with Gqproteins (7Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.O. Science. 1991; 350: 804-807Crossref Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 8Taylor S. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Exton J.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). PI-PLCγ isozymes are the largest of PI-PLC isozymes and are abundant in many tissues and cell types. The biological significance of the PI-PLCγ1 enzyme has been documented (2Kamat A. Carpenter G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When PI-PLCγ1 was “knocked out” of mice by targeted gene disruption (9Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the embryos failed to develop beyond 9 days. The lethality was not due to a specific organ failure but to a general lack of growth in all parts of the embryo. Thus, in an intact mammal PI-PLCγ1 is indispensable for cell proliferation, and the requirement is not compensated for by other signal transduction pathways or other PI-PLC isozymes. The enzymes are activated by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors (10Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 11Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1101-1107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation enhances translocation of protein from cytosol to plasma membrane (10Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). A unique feature of PI-PLCγ isozymes that distinguishes them from the β and δ classes is that the extended sequence between the X and Y domains is homologous to Src domains. These SH2 and SH3 domains can interact with protein tyrosine kinases and activate the enzyme (10Kim H.K. Kim J.W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 11Margolis B. Rhee S.G. Felder S. Mervic M. Lyall R. Levitzki A. Ullrich A. Zilberstein A. Schlessinger J.

Flanking these Src homology domains is a split PH domain as well. Deletion of SH2 and SH3 domains produces an enzyme that still has catalytic activity but altered regulation (14Emori Y. Homma Y. Sorimachi H. Kawasaki H. Nakanishi O. Suzuki K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21885-21890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the X and Y domains in tandem leads to a folded structure that has a 20-fold higher activity toward PI and now has optimum activity at pH 7 (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given the structural complexity of this protein, kinetic studies with well defined substrates can shed light on the roles and importance of the different domains for the actual catalytic cleavage of PI. Although purified PI-PLCγ1 exhibits a moderate preference for PIP2as substrate (3Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it can hydrolyze PI efficiently yielding both cIP and I-1-P as products. In the present work we have focused on characterizing the activity of PI-PLCγ1 toward the water-soluble substrate cIP as well as on PI/detergent mixed micelles. As was observed for PI-PLCδ1 (16Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochem istry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), cIP is a substrate for PI-PLCγ1, and examining how nonsubstrate amphiphiles affect kinetic parameters is useful in assessing how interfacial modulation of the protein affects this catalytic step. Although PI-PLCγ1 kinetics show some similarity with PI-PLCδ1, there are critical differences. In particular, the observation of higher specific activity at pH 5 toward both water-soluble cIP and PI, inhibition of PI cleavage by Ca2+concentrations in excess of a critical threshold, the lack of surface or organic solvent activation of the enzyme toward cIP, PA activation toward PI (but not cIP) at pH >6, and changes in the ratio of product cIP to I-1-P by temperature, pH, Ca2+, or other additives provide insights into how this enzyme could be regulated in vivo. DISCUSSIONMammalian PI-PLC isozymes are multidomain enzymes with key roles in signal transduction by virtue of their generation of second messengers by substrate cleavage. A recurring theme is that their action can be modulated by interfaces interacting with several different domains (PH, C2, SH2, and SH3). Distinguishing kinetic enhancements caused by changes in surface properties from those caused by allosteric effects on k cat is often difficult with a phospholipid substrate. However, hydrolysis of cIP, the water-soluble intermediate in the cleavage of PI, can be used as a probe of allosteric effects of interfaces on PI-PLC enzymes. The highK m of several PI-PLC enzymes for cIP compared with PI suggests that an interfacial substrate binds more effectively to the enzyme. Coupled with water-miscible organic solvent activation in the case of bacterial PI-PLC and PI-PLCδ1, the high K mfor cIP is likely to reflect difficulties in the enzyme binding a well hydrated polar molecule. In striking contrast to those PLCs, PI-PLCγ1 is more efficient in hydrolyzing cIP and does not exhibit solvent activation. Because cIP structure is the same, the lowerK m for cIP, lack of cooperativity in cIP binding, and higher V max of PI-PLCγ1 may reflect a local decreased polarity at the active site. Another key kinetic difference involves PH domains. The N-terminal PH domain of PI-PLCδ1 was shown to interact allosterically with amphiphiles (PC or PIP2), causing a 2-fold increase ink cat toward cIP (16Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochem istry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 22Roberts M.F. Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Bruzik K.S. Phosphoinositides: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Biomedical Applications. 718. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1998: 137-157Google Scholar). PI-PLCγ1 has both an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain between the X and Y domains. Although there is significant sequence homology between the PH domains of δ1 and γ1 isozymes, functional similarity is less obvious because there was no effect of PC or other interfaces (including PIP2 solubilized in TX-100 or diC7PC micelles) on the cyclic phosphodiesterase reaction of PI-PLCγ1. The PH domain of PI-PLCγ1 could still aid in anchoring the enzyme to an interface; however, such interactions do not affect the catalytic machinery.PI cleavage by PI-PLCγ1 generates both cIP and I-1-P in parallel. Given the kinetic parameters for cIP hydrolysis (which predict a build-up of cIP prior to I-1-P generation), PI-PLCγ1 is similar to the δ1 isozyme where the E·cIP complex has a relatively long lifetime. Because PI-PLCγ1 also requires Ca2+ for activity, the cIP may have a binding orientation at the active site similar to that for a nonhydrolyzable cIP analog (27Wu Y. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) binding to PI-PLCδ1 (24Essen L.O. Perisic O. Katan M. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Williams R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), where the phosphonate is a bidentate ligand of the active site Ca2+. This arrangement would stabilize E·cIP. However, Ca2+ has another more complex effect on the phosphotransferase activity of PI-PLCγ1 toward PI. Above a threshold concentration, Ca2+ inhibits the first step of the reaction; the cyclic phosphodiesterase step is not inhibited by high Ca2+. The lack of effect on water-soluble cIP is consistent with the Ca2+ affecting properties of the lipid substrate (e.g. Ca2+-induced PI clustering) and not the enzyme. Alternatively, if one invokes a secondary Ca2+ site on the enzyme, then its occupation affects the phosphotransferase step but not the cIP hydrolysis step. However, because additional nonsubstrate interfacial molecules (that do not affect cIP hydrolysis) reduce the high Ca2+ inhibition, the most reasonable explanation is that high Ca2+ alters substrate-Ca2+ interactions, and these changes inhibit PI-PLCγ1.The pH dependence for PI-PLCγ1 action on PI and cIP (roughly a 20-fold higher activity at pH 5 than 7) is also unusual and has mechanistic implications. One or more key residues must be protonated for optimal activity of both phosphotransferase and cyclic phosphodiesterase activities of the full-length enzyme. Interestingly, expression of X and Y domains without the SH2 or SH3 inserted domains yields a highly active enzyme whose pH optimum is shifted to 7 (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A possible model for the pH dependence of PI-PLCγ1 (Fig.8) has the active site of PI-PLCγ1 covered or occluded by the SH2-SH2-SH3 domains at pH 7; this “lid” or cover would be displaced at pH 5 by protonation of key residues (15Horstman D. DeStefano K. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7518-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At pH 5, this SH2-SH2-SH3 lid is “open” and PI-PLCγ1 activity is high; at pH 7, the lid is “closed” and the enzyme has much lower activity. Consistent with this model is the previous observation that protease V8 cleavage activates the enzyme at pH 7, and the cleavage occurs within the lid between the SH3 and Y domains (28Fernald A.W. Jones G.A. Carpenter G. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Active enzyme at pH 5 can be inhibited by excess Ca2+sequestering the substrate PI; this kinetic effect depends on the detergent matrix used to solubilize PI. Ca2+ modulation of the TX-100-PI interface also occurs at pH 7.The addition of anionic lipids (PA, LPA, SDS, and oleic acid) also affects the pH profile, enhancing enzyme activity at pH 7.5. The mechanism for the altered hydrolysis of PI could be due to the amphiphiles interacting with either the enzyme or the substrate. One possible explanation is that anionic lipids bind to the enzyme and open the SH2-SH2-SH3 lid. Their presence should enhance both PI and cIP cleavage at pH 7.5. Because only activity toward PI is enhanced, substrate PI must also be needed to facilitate lid opening at pH 7. Alternatively, activation by PA and similar lipids could be the result of altered substrate properties. The anionic amphiphiles could compete with PI and lessen Ca2+-induced aggregation of substrate. However, that is unlikely to account for (i) the very large activation observed at pH 7.5 and (ii) the observation of the same magnitude of PA activation with PI solubilized in diC7PC and TX-100 micelles (the TX-100 surface is much more susceptible to Ca2+-induced clustering than the PC/PI surface, hence one would expect a difference in the behavior of these two interfaces with PA added). The pK a2 of micellar PA or LPA (either short chain PA or long chain PA in TX-100 micelles) is ∼7 (29Garigapati V.R. Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 486-492Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The significant activation of PI-PLCγ1 around this value in the presence of PA suggests that the PA dianion is critical for this effect. PI-PLCγ1 is regulated in vivo by phosphorylation (30Nishibe S.

Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation might be another switch that alters the interaction of the SH domains with the rest of the protein leading to activation of PI-PLCγ1 at pH 7. Precedence for such interactions can be seen with the SHP-2 structure (32Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This offers the possibility of proteins modulating PI-PLCγ1 activity by interacting with the SH domains and opening the (hypothetical) lid.In summary, a model consistent with unusual kinetics of PI-PLCγ1 toward both water-soluble cIP and interfacially organized PI has been proposed.

PI-PLCγ1 has both an N-terminal domain and a split PH domain between the X and Y domains. Although there is significant sequence homology between the PH domains of δ1 and γ1 isozymes, functional similarity is less obvious because there was no effect of PC or other interfaces (including PIP2 solubilized in TX-100 or diC7PC micelles) on the cyclic phosphodiesterase reaction of PI-PLCγ1.

The mechanism for the altered hydrolysis of PI could be due to the amphiphiles interacting with either the enzyme or the substrate. One possible explanation is that anionic lipids bind to the enzyme and open the SH2-SH2-SH3 lid. Their presence should enhance both PI and cIP cleavage at pH 7.5. Because only activity toward PI is enhanced, substrate PI must also be needed to facilitate lid opening at pH 7. Alternatively, activation by PA and similar lipids could be the result of altered substrate properties. The anionic amphiphiles could compete with PI and lessen Ca2+-induced aggregation of substrate. However, that is unlikely to account for (i) the very large activation observed at pH 7.5 and (ii) the observation of the same magnitude of PA activation with PI solubilized in diC7PC and TX-100 micelles (the TX-100 surface is much more susceptible to Ca2+-induced clustering than the PC/PI surface, hence one would expect a difference in the behavior of these two interfaces with PA added). The pK a2 of micellar PA or LPA (either short chain PA or long chain PA in TX-100 micelles) is ∼7 (29Garigapati V.R. Bian J. Roberts M.F. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1995; 169: 486-492Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The significant activation of PI-PLCγ1 around this value in the presence of PA suggests that the PA dianion is critical for this effect. PI-PLCγ1 is regulated in vivo by phosphorylation (30Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M.T. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 31Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Kim J.W. Machesky L.M. Rhee S.G. Pollard T.D. Science. 1991; 251: 1231-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation might be another switch that alters the interaction of the SH domains with the rest of the protein leading to activation of PI-PLCγ1 at pH 7. Precedence for such interactions can be seen with the SHP-2 structure (32Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhe-Paganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). This offers the possibility of proteins modulating PI-PLCγ1 activity by interacting with the SH domains and opening the (hypothetical) lid. In summary, a model consistent with unusual kinetics of PI-PLCγ1 toward both water-soluble cIP and interfacially organized PI has been proposed. It includes specific enzyme conformational changes due to pH or nonsubstrate ligands as well as Ca2+-induced modulation of interfacial substrate properties as ways to alter enzyme specific activity. The model shown in Fig. 8 also makes several predictions that can be tested in the future: (i) there should be a large conformational change (presumably involving the SH domains) in the enzyme between pH 5 and 7 and (ii) because phosphonate esters have pK avalues shifted from phosphate esters, a phosphono-PA analog would be expected to activate the enzyme but alter the pH profile of PI hydrolysis in the presence of PA.

M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 6853–6864). Upon solubilization, cross-links form spontaneously between the β subunit, 19- and 11.7-kDa fragments of the α subunit, containing trans-membrane segments M7-M10 and M1/M2, respectively. Treatment with Cu2+-phenanthroline (CuP) improves efficiency of cross-linking. Sequencing and immunoblot analysis have shown that the cross-linked products consist of a mixture of β-19 kDa dimers (≈65%) and β-19 kDa–11.7 kDa trimers (≈35%). The α-β cross-link has been located within the 19-kDa fragment to a 6.5-kDa chymotryptic fragment containing M8, indicating that βCys44 is cross-linked to either Cys911 or Cys930. In addition, an internal cross-link between M9 and M10, Cys964-Cys983, has been found by sequencing tryptic fragments of the cross-linked product. The M1/M2-M7/M10 cross-link has not been identified directly. However, we propose that Cys983 in M10 is cross-linked either to Cys104 in M1 or internally to Cys964 in M9. Based on this study, cross-linking induced byo-phthalaldehyde (Or, E., Goldshleger, R., and Karlish, S. J. D.

(1998) Biochemistry 37, 8197–8207), and information from the literature, we propose an approximate spatial organization of trans-membrane segments of the α and β subunits. Renal Na,K-ATPase consists of a catalytic α subunit (112 kDa), a glycosylated β subunit (33 kDa), and a γ subunit (≈6.5 kDa) (3Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). The α subunit contains the ATP hydrolytic site and the Na+ and K+ transport sites. The β subunit is required for correct post-translational processing and stabilizes the α subunit (4Geering K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The γ subunit may be a tissue-specific regulator (5Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent studies on P-type pumps have focused on residues involved in cation or ATP binding, or conformational transitions (3Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cation occlusion sites are located within trans-membrane segments (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and site-directed mutagenesis suggests that side chains within M4, M5, M6, and M8 ligate cations (6Andersen J.P. Vilsen B.

In addition, a variety of studies have defined the topological organization of the catalytic subunits, comprising 10 trans-membrane segments (see Refs. 3Møller J.V. Juul B. Le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar and 7Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8668-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and references therein). The spatial organization of trans-membrane segments of the catalytic subunits is unknown although such information is essential for defining the structure of the cation transport path. Recently published structures of Ca-ATPase and H-ATPase (12Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 329: 835-839Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 13Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 329: 840-843Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), at 8-Å resolution, show that the 10 trans-membrane segments are α-helices and most helices are tilted so that their spatial organization changes at different levels in the membrane. A tentative model of helix packing of Ca-ATPase has been proposed based on constraints of trans-membrane topology, site-directed mutagenesis, and disulfide cross-linking (12Zhang P. Toyashima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L. Nature. 1998; 329: 835-839Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 14Maclennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol.

Modeling of Na,K-ATPase has also been attempted based on hydrophobic labeling and prediction of helix orientation with respect to lipid (16Efremov R.G. Gulyaev D.I. Modyanov N.N. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Despite these attempts, direct determination of helix proximity is largely lacking. Recently, covalent cross-linking experiments have begun to provide such specific information (2Or E. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D.

Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9878-9885PubMed Google Scholar) showed that treatment of detergent-solubilized Na,K-ATPase leads primarily to a 1:1 αβ cross-linked product. Identification of the cross-linked residues constitutes a formidable task for, whereas the β subunit has only one free cysteine, Cys44, located within its single trans-membrane helix (21Kirley T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7185-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the α subunit contains 23 cysteines. The problem could be simplified by using 19-kDa membranes which are obtained by extensive tryptic digestion of Na,K-ATPase. This preparation consists of fragments of the α subunit comprising mainly trans-membrane segments (M1/M2, M3/M4, M5/M6, and M7/M10) connected by the external loops, and a partially cleaved β subunit (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments contain only 10 cysteines located within or next to trans-membrane segments. A potential problem in cross-linking membrane proteins is the possibility of intermolecular cross-linking via random collisions in the membrane. Detergent solubilization can overcome this problem because the soluble protein can be diluted. Indeed Sarvazyan et al. (23Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Sarvazyan N.A. Ivanov A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7855-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have reported that treatment of digitonin-solubilized 19-kDa membranes with CuP yielded two cross-linked products, dimers of fragments containing M7/M10 and M1/M2 (22 kDa:11 kDa) and trimers containing these two fragments with the β subunit (β:22 kDa:11 kDa) in 1:1:1 stoichiometries. These studies established that a cysteine residue within Asn831-Tyr1016 of the α subunit (Cys911, Cys930, Cys964, or Cys983) is cross-linked to the β subunit (Cys44), but did not identify the cysteine. 19-kDa membranes lack ATP-dependent functions, but retain cation occlusion and ouabain binding (8Karlish S.J.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21620-21626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we described a procedure for solubilizing 19-kDa membranes with the non-ionic detergent C12E10 which preserves intact the complex of fragments with occluded Rb ions and bound ouabain (1Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intact soluble complex contains one copy of each fragment. After solubilizing 19-kDa membranes in the absence of Rb ions and ouabain, neither Rb occlusion nor the complex of fragments are intact (1Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because cross-linking in the latter condition, as in Ref. 23Sarvazyan N.A. Modyanov N.N. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26528-26532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, might reveal non-native interactions between fragments, one of our objectives has been to characterize cross-linking of the C12E10-solubilized intact complex of fragments containing occluded Rb ions. A second objective has been to identify cross-linked cysteines. Na,K-ATPase was prepared from pig kidney red outer medulla (26Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and stored at −80 °C. Protein and ATPase activity were determined as described (26Jørgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 356: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Specific activities were 13–18 units/mg of protein. Before use enzyme was thawed and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of 25 mm histidine, 1 mmEDTA(Tris), pH 7.0. 19-kDa membranes were prepared by tryptic digestion of Na,K-ATPase with trypsin (22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and resuspended at 3 mg/ml in 2 mm RbCl, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5. The specific Rb occlusion capacity was 6 to 6.5 nmol/mg of protein. 19-kDa membranes were solubilized with C12E10 at a ratio of 2.2 (w/w) as described by Or et al. (1Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Before cross-linking with CuP the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with RbOH (final concentration, 0.8 mm). The solubilized preparation (0.4 mg/ml) was treated at 20–22 °C with CuP (final concentration: 0.5/2.5 mm), added in 5 aliquots every 12 min. After 1 h solid urea was added to 2 m and the pH was readjusted to 8.0 with solid Tris base. Free cysteines were blocked by adding iodoacetamide to 40 mm and free Cu2+ was chelated with 10 mm EDTA(Tris). After 30 min at 20–22 °C the mixture was acidified to pH ≈ 6.0 with acetic acid and protein was precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol/ether (2:1) and stored at −20 °C overnight. When analytical amounts were cross-linked, urea, Tris base, and acetic acid were omitted. Precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 9700 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and dissolved in loading buffer. Samples were resolved by Tricine-SDS-PAGE as in Refs. 22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 27Schägger H. von-Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar. Either 14-cm short or 23-cm long gels were used. In nonreducing conditions glutathione and mercaptoethanol were omitted from sample and running buffers. Precipitated protein (15 mg) was dissolved in 2 ml of nonreducing sample buffer and resolved on two 1.5-mm thick long 10% Tricine gels. Gels were briefly fixed, stained, and destained and bands of interest were cut out and equilibrated with 660 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.9, for 1 h. Protein was eluted into 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS using a Bio-Rad Model 422 Electro-Eluter, run at 8 mA/tube overnight. Eluted protein was precipitated with 4 volumes of methanol at −20 °C after adjusting the pH to 7.0 with acetic acid. Pellets were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS. Samples were analyzed on a minigel to check the amounts and purities of the eluted proteins. Protein (0.8 mg/ml) in 35 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.07% SDS was digested with trypsin (10% w/w) at 37 °C in the presence of 2 m urea and 10 mm CaCl2. Digestions with chymotrypsin (10% w/w) were done at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% SDS. Proteolytic digestions were stopped with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Purified protein (0.1–0.25 mg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% octyl glucoside, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and 50 ng of catalytic subunit of PKA. Autoradiography was carried out using a Fuji BAS 1000 PhosphorImager after transfer of proteins from the gel to PVDF paper. Free or cross-linked β subunit (0.1 mg/ml) in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing also 0.01% SDS and 0.7% octyl glucoside, was treated with 2500 units of N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 20 h. The reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer. Protein samples were separated on short Tricine gels, which were electroblotted onto PVDF (Semi-Phor TE70, Hoefer Scientific Instruments) (28Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PVDF sheets were incubated with antisera (22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were stained by diaminobenzidine with metal ion enhancement (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 509Google Scholar). Bands of interest were cut out of the gel, equilibrated in 660 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.9, for 1 h and transferred to PVDF by either of two procedures. (a) Bands were separated on a second 1.5-mm thick short 10% Tricine gel and electroblotted onto PVDF (22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (b) Bands were cut into small pieces, and protein was eluted into 1.7 ml of 1 m Tris-Cl, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.45, by mixing on a rotating wheel for 20 h. Supernatants were transferred into 3-ml syringes connected to 13-mm Swinnex filter holders (Millipore) and eluted proteins were blotted onto PVDF (Immobillon PSQ Millipore) by centrifugation at 290 × g for 25 min. Sequencing of peptides blotted onto strips of PVDF was done on an Applied Biosystems Model 475A protein sequencer with an on-line Model 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer. Each reported sequence was done at least twice. 1,10-Phenanthroline-HCl was from BDH Chemicals,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (bovine pancreas) was from Worthington, α-chymotrypsin was from Merck, N-glycosidase F was from New England Biolabs, and octyl glucoside from Calbiochem. Trypsin inhibitor (type 1-S from soybean), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetamide, ouabain, thioglycolate, Tricine, C12E10, and molecular weight markers (SDS17 and VII-L) were from Sigma. Electrophoresis grade reagents for SDS-PAGE and PVDF paper were from Bio-Rad and Millipore, respectively. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham. Antisera recognizing Asn889-Gln903 and Lys1012-Tyr1016 (anti-KETYY) and the catalytic subunit of PKA were gifts from colleagues (see “Acknowledgments”). Antisera were raised against an 11.7-kDa peptide containing M1/M2 (N-terminal Asp68) and a 16-kDa fragment of the β subunit (N-terminal Ala5) as described previously (1Or E. Goldshleger R. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Fig.1 presents a representative experiment showing components of C12E10-solubilized 19-kDa membranes in reducing or nonreducing conditions and also cross-linked products after treatment with CuP. In reducing conditions (Red), untreated C12E10-solubilized 19-kDa membranes reveal the standard 19-kDa and smaller (8–12 kDa) fragments of the α subunit (the latter are not well resolved on this 10% gel), an intact β subunit or its ≈50-kDa glycosylated and 16-kDa fragments (22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In nonreducing conditions (Non-red) one major new band appeared, 70–80 kDa, and the intensity of the 19-kDa fragment was less than in reducing conditions. The ≈50- and 16-kDa fragments were not seen because they are internally cross-linked between Cys125 and Cys148. After treatment of C12E10-solubilized 19-kDa membranes with CuP (Sol), the intensity of the 70–80-kDa band rose and that of the 19-kDa peptide and β subunit decreased further (compare Sol with non-Red), suggesting that this band contains both the 19-kDa peptide and β subunit. About 63% of the β subunit underwent cross-linking based on the weight ratio of the cross-linked product and remaining β subunit extracted from gels (≈3.1, w/w), and on the composition of the cross-linked product (see Table I). Raising CuP concentration or incubation time did not improve the yield (not shown). CuP treatment of unsolubilized 19-kDa membranes, containing occluded Rb ions, did not produce the 70–80-kDa cross-linked band (Mem). After denaturation of 19-kDa membranes with SDS, CuP treatment did not produce the 70–80-kDa band (SDS), excluding the possibility that the cross-link is the product of a nonspecific association of its components after termination of the reaction. A small amount of a higher molecular weight band (Fig. 1,asterisk) was observed after C12E10solubilization but the amount was not increased by CuP treatment. This band was also observed with intact 19-kDa membranes. It may represent the product of inter-molecular cross-linking between adjacent complexes, and therefore it was not investigated further. In conditions producing the 70–80-kDa band the remaining 19-kDa fragment ran a little faster than in the other conditions, implying that the peptide is more compact (compare Non-red and Sol with Mem, and SDS). This hints at the possibility of an internal cross-link (see also TableII).Table ISequences found in the major CuP cross-linked productFragmentResidueAverage yieldpmol/cycleβ SubunitAla5LysGluGluGlu26322825242150 kDaGly143GluArgLysVal1713928151919 kDaAsn831ProLysThrAsp172217131121M1–M2Asp68GlyProAsnAla91551268 Open table in a new tab Table IISequence analysis of cross-linked tryptic fragmentsN-terminal sequenceAverage yieldpmol/cycleFragment aMet973TyrProLeuLysProThr11.7Asn944LysIleLeuIlePheGly5.6Ile946LeuIlePheGlyLeuPhe7.0Fragment bMet973TyrProLeuLysProThr10.3Asn944LysIleLeuIlePheGly2.4Ile946LeuIlePheGlyLeuPhe6.2 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 presents an immunoblot using anti-KETYY to detect cross-links in intact 19-kDa membranes. After CuP treatment in the presence of Rb ions (+Rb) the antibody recognized the 19-kDa fragment but no higher molecular mass species, confirming the absence of cross-links in intact 19-kDa membranes seen in Fig. 1. By contrast, after CuP treatment in the absence of Rb ions (−Rb) the amount of 19-kDa peptide was reduced, and a number of bands appeared (30.8–66 kDa), as well as a smear of material in the upper half of the gel. Using antibodies raised against fragments containing M1/M2, M3/M4, and M5/M6 all these bands were recognized by anti-M1/M2 and some of them also by anti-M3/M4 or anti-M5/M6 (not shown). This heterogeneity suggests that the cross-links might be nonspecific. In fact the same pattern of anti-KETYY recognition was found for 19-kDa membranes in which Rb occlusion had been thermally inactivated (30Or E. David P. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Shainskaya A. Nesaty V. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7311-7319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,Th.in). As discussed below these cross-links cannot be assumed to represent proximities between fragments in a native state. The components of the 70–80-kDa cross-linked product have been identified by sequencing (Table I) and immunoblots (e.g Fig.3). Immunoblots showed that both spontaneously formed and CuP-induced cross-linked product contain the β subunit 19-kDa peptide (M7-M10) and an 11.7-kDa peptide (M1/M2) (not shown). N-terminal sequencing clearly identified four fragments (Table I). Two sequences are derived from the β subunit (N terminus Ala5 in 19-kDa membranes, Ref. 22Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1150-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is partially cleaved to fragments of 16 kDa (N terminus Ala5) and ≈50 kDa (N terminus, Gly143). The sequence with N terminus Ala5 represents both the 16-kDa fragment and intact β subunit, and about 65% is cleaved judging by the yields of 26 and 17 pmol/cycle, respectively. Two sequences are derived from the α subunit: 19 kDa (N terminus Asn831, 17 pmol/cycle) and 11.7 kDa (N terminus Asp68, 9 pmol/cycle). Note that the yields of the components are not stoichiometric. The excess β subunit (26 pmol/cycle) over the 19-kDa fragment (17 pmol/cycle) implies that the cross-linked product was not completely resolved from free β subunit. The different yields of the 19- and 11.7-kDa fragments could imply that the cross-linked product consists of either a mixture of β:19-kDa dimers (≈65%) and β:19 kDa:11.7 kDa trimers (≈35%) or a mixture of dimers, β:19 kDa and β:11.7 kDa, which are not well resolved on the gel. Deglycosylation of the β subunit has allowed us to distinguish between these alternatives. The deglycosylated cross-linked product was clearly resolved into two bands of 62- and 54 kDa (Fig.3 A, Coom). Both bands were recognized by anti-β antibodies and anti-KETYY but only the upper 62-kDa band was recognized also by anti-M1/M2. Thus the cross-linked product consists of a mixture of β:19-kDa dimers and β:19 kDa:11.7-kDa trimers. The following experiments demonstrate cross-linking of Cys44 of the β subunit to a cysteine in M8 (Cys911 or Cys930), and an internal cross-link between Cys964 (M9) and Cys983 (M10). We have not been able to identify the M7/M10-M1/M2 cross-link, probably because the β:19 kDa:11.7-kDa trimer was formed in too low a yield (see “Discussion”). One approach involved tryptic digestion of the 70–80-kDa product and sequencing of cross-linked fragments. Cross-linked fragments were identified as bands present in non-reducing but absent in reducing conditions (Fig. 4). Several such bands were observed (marked **, *, a and b). The bands marked with an asterisk (*) were not sequenced for they were observed also in digests of the β subunit and represent fragments cross-linked by internal S-S bridges (not shown). The two fragments a, 9.3 kDa, and b, 7.7 kDa, were not observed in digests of the β subunit and were sequenced (Table II). Fragment a contained three peptides derived only from the α subunit, with N termini Met973 (M10), Asn944, and Ile946 (M9), respectively. The combined average yield of fragments containing M9 is 12.6 pmol/cycle while that of the fragment containing M10 is 11.7 pmol/cycle. These yields are measured against a background of about 1 pmol/cycle, i.e. with a possible error of about 10%. Thus, the experiment demonstrates that M9 and M10 are present in equimolar proportions, suggesting that Cys964 within M9 and Cys983 within M10 are cross-linked to each other. Sequencing of fragment b led to essentially the same result suggesting that it is a truncated version of fragment a (probably cleaved at Arg998 or Arg1003). The evidence for the internal cross-link Cys964-Cys983 in Table II excludes either residue as a partner of Cys44 of the β subunit, unless one makes an unlikely assumption that Cys44 can form S-S bridges with different cysteines in the 19-kDa peptide. Thus, one could predict that Cys44 is cross-linked to either Cys911 or Cys930 in M8. However, direct evidence was not obtained because we detected no cross-linked band containing sequences from both α and β subunits. A hypothesis to explain the paradox could be that the broad band (**) in Fig. 4contains cross-linked fragments of both α and β subunits, but the latter are also cross-linked by the internal S-S bridges to other glycosylated fragments of the β subunit. Sequencing of this band (**) showed indeed that it consists of a heterogenous mixture of peptides which precludes simple interpretation (not shown). The hypothesis just proposed was tested as follows (Figs.5, 6, and TableIII). The 70–80-kDa cross-linked product, or the 19-kDa fragment, were first incubated with protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP, in order to phosphorylate Ser936 in the PKA site RRNS (32Fisone G. Cheng S.X.-J. Nairn A.C. Czernik A.J. Hemmings Jr., H.C. Höög J.-O. Bertorello A.M. Kaiser R. Bergman T. Jörnvall H. Aperia A. Greengard P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30436-30444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the labeled proteins were then digested with chymotrypsin. 2Chymotrypsin was used rather than trypsin in order to avoid cleavage before the PKA phosphorylation site. The digestion products were resolved on a 16.5% gel, blotted onto PVDF paper, which was first autoradiographed (Fig. 5, 32Pi) and then also immunostained with an antibody recognizing residues Asn889-Gln903 in the loop between M7 and M8 (Fig. 5, L7–8). For greater ease of understanding, the scheme in Fig. 5 marks the positions of the Asn889-Gln903 epitope and the phosphorylation site of PKA in relation to the trans-membrane segments, M7-M10. In nonreducing conditions only broad, poorly defined bands of32Pi-labeled material (*) were observed (Non-red). However, in reducing conditions, a discreet32Pi-labeled band of 6.5 kDa appeared (Red). The same 6.5-kDa band appeared also in a chymotryptic digest of32Pi-labeled 19-kDa fragment resolved under reducing conditions (19 kDa). Thus the 6.5-kDa band is a fragment of the α subunit containing Ser936 which is cross-linked to the broad band of material in nonreducing conditions and is released by reduction of an S-S bridge. By contrast to the result with PKA phosphorylation of Ser936, the anti-Asn889-Gln903 antibody recognized an 8.0-kDa chymotryptic fragment, the size of which was not affected by reduction (Fig. 5, L7–8). Thus, this fragment is not a cross-linked species and does not contain the PKA site at Ser936 (compare L7–8 with32Pi).Figure 6Preparation of the32Pi-labeled chymotryptic fragment of the cross-linked product used for N-terminal sequencing. The CuP cross-linked product (300 μg, 0.2 mg/ml) was labeled with 51 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP by PKA, precipitated with methanol, and then digested at 1 mg/ml with chymotrypsin for 70 min. Samples (50 μg) were resolved on a long 16.5% T, 6% C gel under reducing (Red) or nonreducing conditions (Non-red). The gel was autoradiographed using a Fuji BAS 1000 Ph"

Most of these insertions (31) are single cytidines; however, single uridines are inserted at six sites, and the dinucleotides, CU and GC, are inserted at two sites and one site, respectively.

RNA editing is defined as the insertion, deletion, or substitution of nucleotides in an RNA such that the sequence of the RNA is different from that of the DNA encoding it (1Benne R. Van Den Burg J.

A unique type of RNA editing is found in mitochondria of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. In this organism most of the RNA editing sites are single cytidine (C) insertions, but occasional single uridine (U) insertions and dinucleotide (AA, AU, CU, and GU) insertions are also observed (2Mahendran R.

The locations of these editing sites are quite evenly distributed throughout the RNA with an average separation of about 25 nucleotides in mRNA and 45 nucleotides in rRNA. In Physarummitochondria, RNA editing has been observed in all of the three RNA types: mRNA (2Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Miller D.L.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RNA editing is required for gene expression because it produces a continuous open reading frame in mRNAs and produces conserved primary sequences and secondary structures in tRNAs and rRNAs. In contrast to trypanosome editing in which only uridines are inserted (10Stuart K. Allen T.E. Heidmann S. Seiwert S.D. Microbial. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), in Physarum mitochondria any of the four nucleotides can be inserted but only in certain combinations (2Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Miller D.L. Nature. 1991; 349: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Ling M. Wang S. Yang N. Costandy H. Brennicke A. Kuck U.

Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Miller D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytidines and uridines can be inserted as single nucleotides or members of certain dinucleotides (for example, AU, GU, and CU). Adenosine and guanosine have only been observed to be inserted as members of a dinucleotide insert (for example, AA and AU for adenosine and GU for guanosine). The fact that dinucleotide insertions are not just adjacent single nucleotide insertions is indicated by both editing site distribution and by the composition of the dinucleotide inserts. If dinucleotide insertions were produced by the occasional placement of two single insertion sites at adjacent positions, then the composition of the dinucleotide sites would reflect the composition of the single nucleotide insertion sites. This is clearly not the case because adenosine and guanosine nucleotides have only been observed to be inserted at dinucleotide insertion sites and because CC insertions, the type of dinucleotide insertion predicted to be most common based on single insertion nucleotide frequency, are not normally observed inPhysarum RNA. In addition, analysis of editing site distribution reveals an apparent constraint on how close together single nucleotide editing sites can be. No two sites have been observed to be separated by fewer than nine nucleotides (3Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Ling M. Wang S. Yang N. Costandy H. Benne R. RNA Editing: The Alteration of Protein Coding Sequences of RNA. Ellis Horwood, London1993: 87-101Google Scholar). In terms of their relationship to single nucleotide insertions, dinucleotides could be inserted in several ways. For example: 1) All nucleotides could be inserted by the same process, independent of their identity or whether they are inserted as mono- or dinucleotides. 2) Nucleotides could be inserted by type at specific sites, such that one type of nucleotide is first inserted at a heterodinucleotide insertion site and then a second nucleotide is inserted to complete the site. This would also predict that single cytidines would be inserted separately from single uridines. The order in which nucleotide types are inserted could be sequential or random. 3) Dinucleotides could be inserted in a separate process from the insertion of mononucleotides. This would predict that cytidines and uridines in heterodinucleotides would be inserted separately from the insertion of cytidines or uridines as single nucleotides. These different modes of dinucleotide insertion would result in different patterns of nucleotide insertions in cDNAs corresponding to partially edited RNAs. By isolating and examining cDNAs corresponding to partially edited RNAs, these modes of dinucleotide editing can be distinguished. RNA editing in Physarum is very efficient as judged by the frequency at which insertions are present at potential editing sites in steady state RNA (3Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Ling M. Wang S. Yang N. Costandy H. Benne R. RNA Editing: The Alteration of Protein Coding Sequences of RNA. Ellis Horwood, London1993: 87-101Google Scholar, 4Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Costandy H.

In the mRNA of ATP synthase, the frequency of editing sites without a nucleotide insertion is lower than 5% (3Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Ling M. Wang S. Yang N. Costandy H. Benne R. RNA Editing: The Alteration of Protein Coding Sequences of RNA. Ellis Horwood, London1993: 87-101Google Scholar, 4Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Costandy H. Wang S. Ling M. Yang N. Semin.

VCH, Weinheim, Germany1993: 53-62Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this efficiency is that editing in Physarum occurs at or very near the mitochondrial transcription complex so that nascent transcripts are edited as an early step in mitochondrial gene expression. Consistent with this idea Visomirski-Robic and Gott (11Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4324-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in isolated mitochondria in which one of the ribonucleotide triphosphates is limiting, RNA editing has occurred very close to the stalled mitochondrial RNA polymerase. However, cDNAs corresponding to RNAs that are partially edited have been detected (9Antes T.J. Costandy H. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Miller D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these RNAs are RNA editing intermediates or aberrant, incompletely edited by-products of the editing process, their nucleotide insertion pattern provides information about the way in which nucleotides are inserted inPhysarum mitochondrial RNAs. Because these RNAs are rare, cDNAs corresponding to them have been difficult to isolate. We report here that the Physarum mitochondrial apocytochromeb mRNA is extensively edited. This editing includes not only single cytidine insertions but also a significant number of single uridine insertions as well as three dinucleotide insertions, one of which (GC) has not been previously reported. We also describe a method to isolate and examine PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); RT, reverse transcription; cyt b , cytochrome b. -derived cDNAs of very rare, partially edited mRNAs that provide information about the relationship of dinucleotide and mononucleotide insertions. P. polycephalum strain M3 (originally characterized at McArdle Laboratory, Madison, WI) was generously provided by R. Marsh (University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX) from the Guttes collection. Microplasmodia were grown at 27 °C in the dark, with continuous agitation, in semi-definedPhysarum medium (13Daniel J.W. Baldwin H.H. Methods Cell Physiol. 1964; 1: 9-41Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Microplasmodia were generally harvested 96 h after inoculation. mtDNA was isolated from microplasmodia as described by Jones et al. (14Jones E.P. Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Yang Y.-C. Miller D.L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After microplasmodia were harvested by centrifugation and washed with water three times, they were homogenized in a Waring blender for 15 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 650 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. Mitochondria were pelleted from the supernatant fluid by centrifugation at 8000 × g. The mitochondria were then purified by several rounds of differential centrifugation. Purified mitochondria were used for RNA and DNA isolation. All solutions for the isolation of RNA were prepared in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. RNA was isolated from mitochondria (15Locker J. Biochemistry. 1979; 98: 358-564Google Scholar) by lysis in an equal volume of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS) followed immediately by three rounds of phenol extraction and one chloroform extraction. The aqueous layer was separated from the organic phase by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. RNA was then precipitated with 0.3 volumes of 2 m potassium acetate, pH 4.55, and 3 volumes of ethanol and stored at −20 °C. mtRNAs were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose, 7 m urea gels. The gel was electroblotted in a Hoeffer model TE50 apparatus onto a Nytran filter (Schleicher & Schuell). The buffer was 1× TAE (12 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 6 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA). The gel was blotted at 500 mA with cooling for 15 h. The RNA was cross-linked to the filter by exposure to 254-nm UV light for 2 min, and the filter washed for 30 min at 65 °C in 1× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS. Hybridizations were routinely done at 42 °C in 50% formamide, and the Nytran filters were washed twice in 2× SSC at 25 °C and twice in 0.2× SSC at 42 °C. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an ABI 381A DNA synthesizer. The following oligonucleotides were used in RT-PCR: C2, 5′-CTTTATTGTAGTATATGCTCA-3′; C5, 5′-ATATGCTTATTTAAGGACAT-3′; C9, 5′-GTCTTATTGGGCAGCTAC-3′; C10, 5′-CTGGTAGTGGTACATCTTC-3′; C12, 5′-CAGGGAGTTTTTGAACAGC-3′; C15, 5′-GCAACAAGGGCAATAACAC-3′; C18, 5′-GAATTTGTAATATTACTTTG-3′; C21, 5′-GCGAAAAAGATGAGCAT-3′; C22, 5′-GTACCACTACCAGATTG-3′; C23, 5′-CTACTTACAATGCGT-3′; C24, 5′-GTAGCTGCCCAATAAGACAT-3′; and C25, 5′-GGTGTTATTGCCCTTGTTGC-3′. Nucleic acids isolated from purified mitochondria were treated with DNase I (RNase-free, Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 μl Inhibit-ACE (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) at 37 °C for 30 min. DNase I was removed by phenol extraction followed by chloroform extraction. The samples were precipitated in 0.3m sodium acetate with ethanol. RNA and primer were suspended in water, heated at 70 °C for 10 min, and then quickly chilled in ice. Primer extension was performed under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies) using First Strand buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm dNTPs, 1 μl of Inhibit-ACE, and 1 μl (200 units) Superscript RT (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cDNAs were amplified as described by Saiki et al. (16Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). The cDNAs were resuspended in 100 μl of Taq polymerase buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 50 m dNTPs). Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Perkin-Elmer) and 0.5 μg of the appropriate primers were added to each sample, and then the sample was overlaid with mineral oil. The cycling temperatures and timing used were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 42 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Routinely 30 cycles were performed. For cloning, the PCR products and vector pIBI30 or pIBI25 were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated, and used to transform Escherichia coli to ampicillin resistance. Bacterial colonies containing plasmids with cDNA insertions were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. The positive clones were then sequenced. DNA sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequence analysis and alignment, amino acid sequence assignment, and homology searches were done using the MicroGenie sequence analysis package (18Queen C. Korn L.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 581-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). RT-PCR products were first digested withAlwNI for GC insertion, MnlI for CU insertion orStyI for C insertion and then separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The agarose gel at the position of undigested DNA was excised, and the residual DNA in the agarose was isolated using glassmilk (GeneClean II, Bio 101, Vista, CA). These DNAs were reamplified by PCR using the same primers. The PCR products were digested with AlwNI, MnlI, or StyI again and then cloned as described above. We have studied a previously uncharacterized region of thePhysarum mitochondrial genome that is known to be actively transcribed (14Jones E.P. Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Yang Y.-C. Miller D.L. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes from this region detect a distinct 1.7-kb RNA band (Fig. 1). The mtDNA sequence of the region coding for this RNA does not contain a significant open reading frame. However, small stretches of open reading frame encode amino acid sequences that are similar or identical to the sequence of cytochrome b (cyt b) from a variety of mitochondria. Amino acid sequence alignments indicated that numerous frameshifts were required to produce one continuous open reading frame with homology to cyt b, suggesting that thePhysarum mitochondrial cyt b mRNA is edited. To test whether this was the case, cDNAs were generated from mtRNA using reverse transcriptase and then amplified using PCR. Comparison of cDNA and mtDNA sequences reveals that the mtRNA sequences differ from their mtDNA template by the addition of nucleotides that compensate for the frameshifts (Fig.2). Totally, there are 40 insertion sites. Most (31 of 40) are single C insertions. However, 6 single U insertions as well as two types of dinucleotide insertion (CU and GC) are also observed. Although AU, CU, and GU insertions have been previously observed in the mRNA for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25483-25486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rundquist B.A. Gott J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and CU and AA dinucleotide insertions have been previously reported in the small subunit rRNA of Physarum mitochondria (7Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Ghate A. Ling M.-L. Jeng K. Miller D.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this is the first observation of a GC dinucleotide insertion. This GC dinucleotide insertion provides a second way in which guanosines can be inserted in Physarum RNA and, taken together with the previous observation of AA and AU dinucleotide insertions (7Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Ghate A. Ling M.-L. Jeng K. Miller D.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Rundquist B.A. Gott J.M. Mol. Gen.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that any of the four nucleotides can be inserted in Physarum RNAs. However, the way in which these nucleotides can be inserted appears to be constrained. All three dinucleotide insertions are at sites flanked by one or more nucleotides that are the same as the inserted nucleotides. This results in a cDNA sequence in which it is ambiguous which of several nucleotides corresponds to the inserted nucleotide. This also makes it ambiguous whether the dinucleotide insertion is GC or CG, CU or UC. This ambiguity has been observed for other dinucleotide insertions as well (6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25483-25486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Ghate A. Ling M.-L. Jeng K. Miller D.L.

The editing sites are relatively evenly distributed throughout the entire coding sequence with an average separation of 27 nucleotides and a standard deviation of 15 nucleotides (Fig. 2). As observed for other edited RNAs inPhysarum (2Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Miller D.L. Nature. 1991; 349: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is a bias for cytidine insertions to be downstream of purine-pyrimidine dinucleotides. Although the location of 18 of the 31 cytidine insertions cannot be exactly determined (due to their insertion next to an existing cytidine), 21 of 31 cytidines (68%) are inserted after, or have the potential to be inserted after, a purine-pyrimidine dinucleotide. Analysis of the cyt b mRNA indicates that editing sites are confined to the open reading frame. Although the average spacing between editing sites is 27 nucleotides within the reading frame, no editing sites were detected within 85 bases of the termination codon or within 65 additional bases downstream of the termination codon. Nor were any editing sites detected for greater than 100 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. However, a reading frame is not required for editing because tRNAs and rRNAs that lack significant open reading frames are also edited in Physarum (7Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Ghate A. Ling M.-L. Jeng K. Miller D.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Antes T.J. Costandy H. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Miller D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may instead indicate that editing sites are confined to functional sequences in Physarum mtRNAs. At six sites (sites 10, 18, 22, 24, 26, and 40) single uridines are inserted. Sequence analysis of numerous independent cDNAs consistently showed uridine and not cytidine insertions at these sites. Although a single uridine insertion has been reported in the mRNA for subunit 1 of cytochrome oxidase (6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25483-25486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the small subunit rRNA (7Mahendran R. Spottswood M.R. Ghate A. Ling M.-L. Jeng K. Miller D.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and tRNAGlu (9Antes T.J. Costandy H. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Miller D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7521-7527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this is the highest concentration of uridine insertions detected inPhysarum RNA to date. This high concentration of noncytidine insertions provides an opportunity to study the relationship of these insertions to the cytidine insertions. The uridine insertions are not clustered but are interspersed within the cytidine insertion sites. None of the uridine insertions are closer to a cytidine insertion than nine nucleotides, the minimum observed distance between cytidine insertion sites. These six uridine insertion sites bring the number of reported uridine insertions in Physarum orDidymium RNA to 10. The uridine insertion sites from these RNAs have been aligned in Fig. 3 for comparison. In every case except one (cyt b site 24) the uridine insertion is next to one or more mtDNA-encoded uridines (a frequency higher than expected by chance), and with one exception (cyt b site 10) the uridine insertion could be located downstream of a purine-pyrimidine dinucleotide. Other than these features there does not seem to be any consistent similarity in the sequence around the uridine insertion sites. Insertion of these 43 nucleotides creates an open reading frame of 392 codons. Sixteen different codon types are created by C insertions, and four codon types are created by U insertions. Of the nine C insertion codon types in which the location of the insertion can be unambiguously assigned, four (CUU, CUA, CAA, and CGU) have the C insertion at the first position, one (UCU) has the C insertion at the second position, and four (AUC, GUC, AAC, and AGC) have the C insertion at the third position. The four codon types in which cytidine is inserted at the third position are used eight times and make up 62% of the 13 cytidine insertions in which the location of the insertion can be unambiguously assigned. The relative position of the U insertions within the codon cannot be determined because, with one exception, the insertions are next to a pre-existing U. The amino acid sequence deduced from the open reading frame in the cDNA sequence shows extensive homology to the cytochromeb apoprotein from mitochondria of yeast (19Nobrega F.G. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9828-9837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), man (20Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. Bruijn M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperson I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J.L. Staden R. Young I.G. Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7684) Google Scholar), and maize (21Dawson A.J. Jones V.P. Leaver C.J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2107-2113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). All of the major amino acid motifs conserved in plants, animals, and fungi are also present in the sequence inferred from the edited RNA fromPhysarum. These data indicate that the 1.7-kb RNA is the apocytochrome b mRNA and that it is extensively edited to generate a functional mRNA. Consistent with the ancient divergence of Physarum from the eukaryotic line, thePhysarum sequence is as divergent from the cyt bsequences of plant, animals, and fungi as these sequences are from one another. To determine the relationship of the GC dinucleotide insertion to the more prevalent single cytidine insertions, a protocol has been developed to isolate and examine cDNAs corresponding to partially edited transcripts. The insertion of the GC dinucleotide in mRNA creates an AlwNI site in its cDNA. If the GC dinucleotide is not inserted or if only one of the two nucleotides is inserted, this site will be absent in cDNAs derived from this RNA (Fig. 2). Because the AlwNI recognition sequence (5′-CAGNNNCTG-3′) includes six specific nucleotides and spans nine nucleotides, any of a number of substitutions, deletions, or insertions would result in the absence of the AlwNI site in the cDNA. To enrich for rare cyt b cDNAs lacking the AlwNI site, cDNAs produced by RT-PCR from cyt b mRNA that lacked theAlwNI site were selectively amplified. A mtRNA preparation was first digested with DNase I to remove contaminating mtDNA and then used as a template for reverse transcriptase to synthesize cDNAs. PCR primers flanking several editing sites including the GC insertion site were used to selectively amplify cDNAs derived from the mtRNA. These amplification products were digested with AlwNI, and the two digestion products were separated from the uncut amplification product by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Almost all of the amplification product was digested by AlwNI. This result indicates that a high percentage of mtRNAs in the steady state population is edited at this site, consistent with previous results from Gott et al. (6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25483-25486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rundquist B.A. Gott J.M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and Miller et al. (3Miller D. Mahendran R. Spottswood M. Ling M. Wang S. Yang N. Costandy H. Benne R.

VCH, Weinheim, Germany1993: 53-62Google Scholar) indicating that the efficiency of nucleotide insertion at a given editing site is greater than 95%. The undigested amplification product was excised from the agarose gel, and the residual DNA was isolated. The isolated DNA was reamplified using the same primers. The resulting PCR products were digested with AlwNI a second time to eliminate amplification products derived from incomplete digestion in the first round. The undigested DNAs were cloned and sequenced. In each trial some amplification products were cloned which lacked insertions at any position. Whether these clones derive from unedited RNAs or from residual mtDNA which escaped DNase I digestion is not known. However, three independent amplification products which lacked the AlwNI site did have insertions at editing sites. With the initial primer set whose amplification products spanned 10 editing sites, we obtained two independent cDNA clones which were fully edited at each of the single cytidine insertion sites but lacked the GC dinucleotide insertion (cDNAs 1 and 2, Fig.5). An additional cDNA clone (cDNA 3, Fig. 5) was obtained using a different RNA preparation and a different set of primers that spanned 22 insertion sites including 16 single C insertions, two single U insertions, and two CU dinucleotide insertions. This cDNA also lacked the GC insertion but was otherwise fully edited. These results suggest that the cytidine of the GC dinucleotide insertion is not added by the same process in which single cytidines are inserted and that the GC dinucleotide insertion occurs separately from mononucleotide insertions. Insertion of the CU dinucleotide was examined using a similar method. Insertion of the CU dinucleotide at site 11 in cyt b mRNA creates a MnlI site in its cDNA (Fig. 5). This MnlI site is absent in cDNAs that lack one or both of the inserted nucleotides. Primers were used that produced an amplification product spanning the first 14 editing sites. An amplification product (cDNA 4) had insertions at editing sites immediately adjacent to the CT dinucleotide insertion site but lacked the CT dinucleotide insertion. This cDNA also lacked a C insertion at site 6. A second round of selection using a different RNA preparation produced four unique cDNAs that lacked the MnlI site (cDNAs 5–8). Similar to cDNA 4, cDNA 5 lacked the CT insertion but was fully edited at sites adjacent to the CT insertion site. In addition seven clones had the editing pattern shown for cDNA 6,i.e. the CT of site 11 was missing as well as the C at the adjacent editing site (site 12) located 19 nucleotides downstream of the CU editing site. Two amplification products had dinucleotide insertions that did not create the MnlI site. In cDNA 7 the dinucleotide insertion was CC, and in cDNA 8 the dinucleotide insertion was TT. No clone was obtained with a single nucleotide inserted at the dinucleotide site. Under the conditions used no clone was obtained with a substitution or an insertion at any position other than at an editing site. These results suggest that the cytidine and uridine of the CU dinucleotide insertion are not added by the same processes in which single cytidines or single uridines are inserted and that the CU dinucleotide insertion occurs separately from mononucleotide insertions. AStyI site is created in cDNAs by a cytidine insertion at site 14. Selection for cDNAs that lack this site using the protocol described above produced amplification products that lacked theStyI site. These cloned amplification products were screened for the presence of the AlwNI or the MnlI site, but none of the cloned amplification products that lacked theStyI site had either the AlwNI or MnlI site, indicating that they lacked the GC and CU dinucleotide insertions. Sequence analysis of 21 of these cloned amplification products revealed sequences that corresponded to fully unedited RNAs. Two types of cDNA corresponding to partially edited RNAs that might be expected based on the dinucleotide experiments were not detected,i.e. cDNAs in which only one or both of the dinucleotide insertions is present in otherwise unedited context (StyI−, MnlI+, and/orAlwNI+) and cDNAs in which a cytidine is not inserted at site 14 in otherwise fully edited context (StyI−, MnlI+, andAlwNI+). Failure to detect the latter type, in contrast to the ease of isolating the analogous cDNA for a dinucleotide site (18 partially edited sequences of 24 cDNAs selected for MnlI− using the same RNA preparation and primer set for RT-PCR), provides additional evidence that mononucleotide and dinucleotide insertions are produced by a separate process. Furthermore, these results indicate that the cDNAs reflect the RNA population and are not an artifact of the selection process. That is, cDNAs corresponding to RNAs with certain editing patterns cannot be selected presumably because they are not represented in the RNA population. Analysis of cDNAs corresponding to partially edited RNAs indicates that dinucleotide insertions are independent from cytidine insertions in that dinucleotide insertions can be absent in sequences fully edited at single cytidine and uridine sites. This observation is consistent with the unique base composition of the dinucleotide insertions and implies at least some degree of autonomy from the process of single cytidine insertion. Visomirski-Robic and Gott (11Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4324-4329Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in isolated mitochondria provided with limiting concentrations of one exogenous ribonucleotide triphosphate, nucleotide insertions can be detected in nascent RNAs at both single nucleotide and dinucleotide editing sites located very close to the mitochondrial transcription complex. Although it is clear that under some conditions editing can be closely associated with the transcription complex, it is not clear whether editing is cotranscriptional with nontemplated nucleotides added to the 3′ end of the nascent RNA or post-transcriptional with nontemplated nucleotides inserted between two templated nucleotides in the RNA. If editing is post-transcriptional in this sense, then it is likely that the partially edited RNAs are intermediates that have not yet been completely edited. The fact that sequences were identified that have cytidine insertions but lack dinucleotide insertions, but not the converse, implies that GC insertions may occur after global cytidine insertion. If editing is cotranscriptional, then partially edited cDNAs must derive from RNAs in which editing failed to insert a nucleotide at a potential editing site. These RNAs would not be intermediates but would indicate that dinucleotide insertions can be skipped without affecting subsequent cytidine insertion. A third possibility is that cytidine insertions are cotranscriptional, whereas dinucleotide insertions are post-transcriptional, which would again indicate that dinucleotides are inserted by a separate mechanism from cytidine insertions. We did not detect a single nucleotide inserted at dinucleotide insertion sites, indicating that the two nucleotides of a dinucleotide insertion are inserted at about the same time under normal growth conditions. Visomirski-Robic and Gott (12Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that RNA synthesized in isolated mitochondria that were incubated under conditions of low ribonucleotide triphosphate concentrations can produce partially edited RNAs similar to the type selected by our technique. They have reported that at low concentrations of UTP, RNAs are produced that can lack the U at a CU insertion site but have the C inserted at this site. This implies that UTP is probably the source of the uridine insertions in heterodinucleotides as CTP is for single cytidine insertion sites. Significant amounts of RNAs with a single nucleotide insertion at potential dinucleotide editing sites may occur only under conditions in which a source ribonucleotide triphosphate is limiting. In contrast, under conditions of limiting CTP, which result in partially edited RNAs with C insertions missing at potential single cytidine editing sites, the CU dinucleotide editing site has both nucleotides inserted (12Visomirski-Robic L. Gott J.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 821-827PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that CU dinucleotide and single C nucleotide sites are differentially affected by low CTP concentrations is consistent with the editing of these two types of site being mechanistically separate. Two cloned cDNAs that lacked the MnlI site had nucleotide insertions but of the wrong type to create the restriction site. Instead of the CT insertion found in most cDNAs at this site, these two cDNAs had a CC or a TT insertion at the site. It is not known whether these cloned cDNAs represent aberrant RNAs in which the wrong nucleotide was inserted or precursor RNAs in which one of the nucleotides is modified to produce the correct sequence. Gott et al. (6Gott J.M. Visomirski L.M. Hunter J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25483-25486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have observed four sites in the coI mRNA in which cytidines are converted to uridines. The presence of this activity in Physarum mitochondria lends credibility to the idea that the CU could be produced by nucleotide conversion. The insertion of all four nucleotides to produce functional mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs in mitochondria of Physarum sets this editing system apart from all others. This complexity could result from multiple mechanisms of concurrent nucleotide insertion or a single mechanism able to identify an editing site and insert the correct number and type of nucleotide at that position. The cyt bmRNA with the most noncytidine insertions of anyPhysarum RNA characterized to date exemplifies the complexity of this process. Further studies of partially editedcyt b mRNAs and comparison of the editing of cyt b mRNAs from other organisms should give insights into the mechanism of this unique type of RNA editing."
https://openalex.org/W2083034560,"Nuclear hormone receptors are ligand-regulated transcription factors that modulate the expression of specific target genes in response to the binding of small, hydrophobic hormone ligands. Many nuclear hormone receptors, such as the retinoic acid receptors, can both repress and activate target gene expression; these bimodal transcription properties are mediated by the ability of these receptors to tether auxiliary factors, denoted corepressors and coactivators. Corepressors are typically bound by receptors in the absence of cognate hormone, whereas binding of an appropriate hormone agonist induces an allosteric alteration in the receptor resulting in release of the corepressor and recruitment of coactivator. Structural analysis indicates that there is a close induced fit between the hormone ligand and the receptor polypeptide chain. This observation suggests that different ligands, once bound, may confer distinct conformations on the receptor that may invoke, in turn, distinct functional consequences. We report here that different retinoids do differ in the ability to release corepressor once bound to retinoic acid receptor and suggest that these differences in corepressor release may manifest as differences in transcriptional regulation.

The bimodal transcriptional properties of the nuclear hormone receptors reflect the ability of these receptors to physically recruit auxiliary proteins, denoted corepressors and coactivators, that help mediate the actual transcriptional response (15Horwitz K.B.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6887-6897Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the absence of cognate hormone, thyroid hormone receptors and RARs bind to a corepressor complex composed of SMRT and/or N-CoR, mSin3A or B, histone deacetylase 1 or 2, Rb-associated proteins p46 and p48, and a number of additional proteins of as-yet unknown function (reviewed in Refs. 29Pazin M.J.

Conversely, addition of hormone leads to release of the corepressor complex by the receptor and the recruitment of a distinct set of polypeptides that serve as coactivators (reviewed in Ref. 15Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Once tethered to the receptor, corepressors and coactivators appear to modulate gene transcription through multiple mechanisms that include modification of the chromatin template and direct interaction with components of the general transcriptional machinery (29Pazin M.J.

Many of these same corepressor and coactivator proteins also participate in transcriptional regulation by an assortment of non-receptor transcription factors (e.g. Refs. 35Yang W.-M. Inouye C.

The ability of nuclear hormone receptors to toggle between a corepressor-bound and a coactivator-bound state is therefore a key aspect of their function. Hormone ligand plays a critical role in this switching phenomenon, with the binding of cognate hormone by receptor leading to the release of corepressor and the recruitment of coactivator (e.g. Refs. 13Casanova J. Helmer E. Selmi-Ruby S. Qi J.S. Au-Flieger M. Desai-Yajnik V. Koudinova N. Yarm F. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell.

Notably, binding of hormone ligand is believed to cause a series of conformational changes in the receptor characterized by a global compacting of the polypeptide chain about the ligand and an alteration in the position of the C-terminal α-helical domain (helix 12) from an extended to a sequestered conformation (41Bourguet W.

X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that the polypeptide chain in the liganded receptor is in close approximation to the bound hormone, with the hormone providing a hydrophobic core that helps mediate the packing of the receptor about it (41Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 42Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

This intimate induced-fit between receptor and ligand suggests that different hormone ligands may confer distinct polypeptide conformations, and therefore potentially distinct properties, once bound to a given receptor (41Bourguet W.

We wished to investigate if, as a consequence, different ligands differ in their ability to modulate the recruitment and release of the corepressor complex. We report here that different retinoid derivatives do indeed differ in the ability to displace SMRT corepressor from RAR; most notably, although both 9-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-retinoic acid are bound with high affinity by RARα, only the all-trans-isomer efficiently induces release of SMRT. All-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid are natural products found in normal physiological contexts; our results suggest that these two retinoids may exert distinct allosteric effects on RARα and may therefore mediate distinct aspects of RAR biology. The glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-RARα, and GST-SMRT/TRAC-2 (codons 751–1495) constructs were created as described previously (20Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, isolated, and immobilized by binding to glutathione agarose. [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled, full-length RARα, PML-RARα, or SMRT proteins were synthesized by a coupled in vitro transcription and translation protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). The radiolabeled proteins were incubated with the immobilized GST fusion proteins in HEMG buffer (20Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar); the agarose matrix was then extensively washed, and proteins remaining bound to the matrix were eluted with soluble glutathione and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The electrophoretograms were visualized by autoradiography and were quantified by STORM PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Mutants of RARα defective for association with the SMRT corepressor (denoted RARα AHT mutants) were created by site-directed mutagenesis (17Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamel Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 37Hong S.-H. David G. Wong C.W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The construction of pSG5 vectors expressing either a GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD)-SMRT fusion or a GAL4 activation domain (AD)-RARα fusion has been previously described (37Hong S.-H. David G. Wong C.W. Dejean A. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9028-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 48Hong S.-H. Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RARα (AHT) mutation was transferred into the pSG5-GAL4AD background in the form of an EcoRV toXhoI fragment generated by polymerase chain reaction. The actual transfections were performed in 12-well tissue culture plates containing 7 × 104 CV-1 cells per well. Transient transfections were performed employing a liposome/Lipofectin methodology (Life Technologies, Inc.), using 25 ng of pSG5 GAL4DBD vector, 100 ng of pSG5 GAL4AD vector, 100 ng of pGL2-GAL4 (17-mer) luciferase reporter plasmid, and 100 ng of a pCMV-promoter-lacZ reporter plasmid (used as an internal control) per well. The cells were subsequently incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of all-trans- or 9-cis-retinoic acid and harvested, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as previously detailed (27Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 34Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Cell.

[35S]Methionine-radiolabeled, full-length RARα was synthesized in vitro by the coupled transcription and translation protocol. For the trypsin and elastase assays, 1 μl of radiolabeled protein was diluted to 16 μl in 50 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.4) buffer containing various concentrations of retinoid hormone or an equivalent volume of ethanol carrier. Proteolysis was initiated by adding 4 μl of protease (either 2 μg/μl type IV elastase or 0.125 μg/μl trypsin pretreated with tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; Sigma). After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, proteolysis was terminated by addition of 14 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were frozen rapidly by transfer to dry ice. The samples were subsequently boiled for 10 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The electrophoretograms were visualized by STORM PhosphorImager analysis. CV-1 cell transfections were performed by the same liposome protocol described for the two-hybrid assay. Approximately 4 × 105 cells were transfected with 25 ng of pSG5-RARα, 100 ng of a reporter construct representing the thymidine kinase promoter joined to luciferase and driven by a β-RARE, and 100 ng of the pCMV-lacZ plasmid employed as an internal control. Alternatively, the cells were transfected with 25 ng of a pSG5-GAL4DBD-RARα construct, 100 ng of the pGL2-GAL4(17-mer)-luciferase reporter, and 100 ng of the pCMV-lacZ internal control. Retinoid hormone was added (or not) 5 h post-transfection, and the cells were harvested at 48 h, and relative luciferase activity (normalized to β-galactosidase activity) was subsequently determined. The SMRT polypeptide represents a principal site of contact between the nuclear hormone receptors and the corepressor complex (16Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

We therefore investigated the effects of different retinoid derivatives on the association in vitro between SMRT and RARα by employing a “GST-pull down” assay. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) derivative of SMRT was synthesized in E. coli, purified, and immobilized on a glutathione-agarose matrix (48Hong S.-H. Wong C.-W. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled, full-length RARα, synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation, was then incubated with the GST-SMRT matrix (20Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After incubation, the matrix was extensively washed, and any radiolabeled RARα remaining bound to the matrix was subsequently eluted with soluble glutathione, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (20Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 27Yoh S.M. Chatterjee V.K.K. Privalsky M.L. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5500-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), radiolabeled RARα bound efficiently to the GST-SMRT matrix in the absence of hormone but not to a non-recombinant GST construct employed as a negative control (Fig.1). Also as previously noted (20Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the ability of RARα to bind to SMRT was severely inhibited by inclusion of either 50 or 500 nm all-trans-retinoic acid in the binding assay (Fig. 1). We next evaluated the ability of an assortment of other retinoids to inhibit the interaction of RARα with SMRT corepressor. In general, the ability of a given retinoid to mediate release of the corepressor paralleled the binding affinity of RARα for that retinoid. For example, RARα possesses little or no measurable affinity for the ret-aldehyde derivatives all-trans-retinal and 9-cis-retinal (49Crettaz M. Baron A. Siegenthaler G. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and consistent with this observation, neither retinal derivative significantly inhibited binding of RARα to the GST-SMRT matrix at hormone concentrations up to 500 nm(Fig. 1). Similarly, all-trans-retinol failed to bind to RARα, and 500 nm all-trans-retinol failed to measurably release the SMRT corepressor from RARα (Fig. 1). In contrast, 13-cis-retinoic acid is bound by RARα, although with a lower affinity than that for all-trans-retinoic acid (49Crettaz M. Baron A. Siegenthaler G. Hunziker W. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and 13-cis-retinoic acid released SMRT from RARα at the 500 nm but not at the 50 nm concentration of this hormone (Fig. 1). Although not unexpected, these results support the hypothesis that retinoids mediate release of corepressor exclusively through the ability to bind to the ligand pocket of the receptor. Intriguingly, there was one notable exception to this general correlation between affinity of the receptor for the ligand and the ability of the ligand to induce corepressor release. The 9-cis-retinoic acid isomer, which has an affinity for RARα virtually equal to that of all-trans-retinoic acid (50Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J.F. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), was markedly inefficient in mediating the release of SMRT (Fig.2 A). Under our in vitro conditions, 10-fold more of the 9-cis-retinoic acid preparation was required, relative to all-trans-retinoic acid, to obtain an equivalent inhibition of the SMRT/RARα interaction (Fig. 2 B). Both the 9-cis- and all-trans-retinoid preparations were prepared identically, and the concentrations were confirmed spectrophotometrically to ensure that the amounts of each ligand were indeed equal. It was conceivable that the in vitro translated RARα protein, as employed in our assay, might be misfolded or in some other manner selectively impaired in the binding of the 9-cis-isomer. Binding of hormone is known to result in formation of a more compact conformation of the nuclear hormone receptors that manifests as an increase in resistance to proteolysis (47Lin B.C. Hong S.-H.
