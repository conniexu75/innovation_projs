https://openalex.org/W1502865526,"Enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of glucose and other sugars directly to the corresponding aldonic acids appear to be widely distributed in nature, since they have been found in bacteria (l-9)) fungi (10, II), algae (la), and animal tissue (13-15). In a preliminary communication (16), we have reported that the juice sacs of young oranges contain a system for the oxidation of sugars to aldonic acids. The present communication contains further information on the preparation and properties of this oxidase system. It has been shown to catalyze the oxidation of at least nine different sugars and thus appears to have a much wider range of specificity than enzymes previously investigated. Various tests suggest that the oxidation of most of these sugars may occur through the action of a single enzyme with a wide substrate specificity rather than by a family of enzymes, each with a high specificity for a single substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1976764463,"The endochondral growth apparatus of the mandibular condyles, in contrast to epiphyseal plates of long bones, reacts positively to mechanical stimulation. Roentgenographic and histologic analyses of the joint structures of two experimental rhesus monkeys, when compared with untreated controls, showed obvious morphologic and structural transformations of the condylar heads as the result of the instituted treatment. Corollary differences were found in the ontogenetic and histogenetic pattern, as well as in the hormonal control, of these condylar growth centers."

https://openalex.org/W2054813426,"THE experimental studies of Jost1 and Hwang and Wells2 have demonstrated the functional interrelationship of the pituitary and thyroid in the rabbit and rat fœtus. Rumph and Smith3 showed that the thyroid of the 90-mm. pig fœtus contains a substance which would induce metamorphosis in the hypophysectomized tadpole. Geloso4 demonstrated the presence of thyroid hormones in the blood of the rat fœtus. Jost and Picon5 showed that fœtal thyroidectomy resulted in an increase in total body fat in the rabbit fœtus. Bearn6 found an increase in liver fat following hypophysectomy by decapitation in the rabbit fœtus, and correlated this with the increase in the fat content noted in human anencephalic fœtuses. These experiments can be taken to indicate that the fœtal thyroid is capable of function, and that its function is regulated by the fœtal pituitary."

https://openalex.org/W1977912945,"IN a previous communication1, we showed that reserpine causes a similar percentage loss of adrenaline and noradrenaline from the adrenal glands of the rat. Recovery of the catechol amines was slow, the amine content returning to normal within 21 days. The adrenaline content gradually returned to the control value, whereas the noradrenaline content first increased rapidly to a level well above normal at 7 days before falling to the control value."
