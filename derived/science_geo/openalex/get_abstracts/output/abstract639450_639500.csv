https://openalex.org/W2973098646,"Despite its clinical importance, detection of highly divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge. When human samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many assembled contigs as “unknown” since many of the sequences are not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using 300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples. We suggest that the proposed model captures different types of information of genome composition, and can be used as a recommendation system to further investigate sequences labeled as “unknown” by conventional alignment methods. Exploring these highly-divergent viruses, in turn, can enhance our knowledge of infectious causes of diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2972733397,"Obesity in childhood and adolescence is considered the most prevalent nutritional disorder, in which eating behaviours represent one important factors of influence. Many aspects influence eating behaviours, but taste is considered the main predictor. However, data concerning correlations of obesity, taste sensitivity and behavioural attitudes, such as food neophobia, in children and adolescents are inconsistent. Moreover, it has been suggested that oral bacteria could have a possible role in obesity development and, also, in taste perception. In this context, the present study focused on host related factors with a proposed link to weight gain. To this purpose, taste sensitivity, salivary microbiota composition and food neophobia were compared between children and adolescents with and without obesity in a cross-sectional study. Results showed that children with obesity presented a significantly lower ability in correctly identifying taste qualities and were characterized by a lesser number of Fungiform Papillae (reported as FP/cm2) compared to normal-weight subjects. Differences in the ecological indexes of microbial alpha-diversity was found between subjects with obesity and normal-weight ones. Moreover, independently from nutritional status, some bacterial genera seemed to differ between subjects with different sensitivity. The potentiality of this multidisciplinary approach could help to better understand and deepen the sensory-driven and microbiological factors related to weight gain."
https://openalex.org/W2972465294,"Growth hormone (GH) plays a significant role in normal renal function and overactive GH signaling has been implicated in proteinuria in diabetes and acromegaly. Previous results have shown that the glomerular podocytes, which play an essential role in renal filtration, express the GH receptor, suggesting the direct action of GH on these cells. However, the exact mechanism and the downstream pathways by which excess GH leads to diabetic nephropathy is not established. In the present article, using immortalized human podocytes in vitro and a mouse model in vivo, we show that excess GH activates Notch1 signaling in a γ-secretase-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 by γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenyl glycine t-butylester) abrogates GH-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is associated with a reduction in podocyte loss. More importantly, our results show that DAPT treatment blocks cytokine release and prevents glomerular fibrosis, all of which are induced by excess GH. Furthermore, DAPT prevented glomerular basement membrane thickening and proteinuria induced by excess GH. Finally, using kidney biopsy sections from people with diabetic nephropathy, we show that Notch signaling is indeed up-regulated in such settings. All these results confirm that excess GH induces Notch1 signaling in podocytes, which contributes to proteinuria through EMT as well as renal fibrosis. Our studies highlight the potential application of γ-secretase inhibitors as a therapeutic target in people with diabetic nephropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2973085817,"Dairy biofilms as a source of contamination of milk and its products are of great concern in the dairy industry. For a reliable risk assessment, knowledge about the microbial community composition of biofilms in the milking systems of dairy farms must be improved. In this work, swab samples of milking machine biofilms of two dairy farms were investigated by a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. Spots in the milking system with enhanced microbial colonization were identified by quantification on selective and non-selective media. In addition, stainless steel coupons were placed into the piping system of a milking machine, removed after several milking intervals, and investigated for colonization by cultivation and culture-independently. Isolates were differentiated and identified by a combination of chemotaxonomical methods and 16S rRNA sequencing. The culture-independent approach involved treatment of the samples with the viability dye propidium monoazide prior to direct DNA-extraction by enzymatic cell lysis and cloning to exclude bias from dead biomass. The milking equipment retainers and the outlet of the milk bulk tank were identified as highly colonized spots on both farms. A high bacterial diversity was detected covering the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Presence of biofilms was demonstrated on several materials including stainless steel and plastic, which are frequently used in milking machines, but also in dairy processing plants. Growth of mainly Gram-positive bacteria with high percentages of the phylum Actinobacteria was detected on the stainless steel coupons after exposition in the milking system for two to three days. Knowledge about the heterogenic microbial load on different parts of the milking machines and the stainless steel coupons will help to identify primary colonizers of the milking system, to assess the risk potential of biofilms for raw milk, to improve sanitation processes and to identify parts of the milking machine, which should be improved by hygienic design."
https://openalex.org/W2972507349,"Understanding farmers’ behavior, motivations, and perceptions toward antimicrobial use can influence how veterinarians translate research into practice and guide effective ways of implementing protocols. A multidisciplinary team investigated behavioral tendencies of New York dairy farmers toward antimicrobial use by administering a survey modeled with the reasoned action approach. This approach is a framework from social psychology containing the constructs attitude, perceived norms, and perceived behavioral control, and is used in combination with structural equation modeling to determine what drives intentions. Multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) models were then used to determine the effects of beliefs on their underlying constructs. The objective of the study was to provide direct and indirect measures of the constructs using survey data to determine importance of and associations with intention to use antimicrobials prudently. The structural equation model indicated that perceived behavioral control explained intention. Thus, farmers who feel capable of prudent use expressed positive intentions. Attitude and perception of others also had influence to a lesser extent. MIMIC models showed that the most important attributes of instrumental attitude were increasing profitability, decreasing risk of residues, and increasing herd health. Contributing attributes of affective attitude were job satisfaction, decreasing resistance, and increasing milk production. For perceived norms, the attributes were opinions/approval of family and peers, veterinarians, and milk processors. Finally, for perceived behavioral control, attributes focused on saving money on labor and treatment, ability to fit into the daily routine, and effectiveness with veterinary guidance. In conclusion, the best approach for adoption of practices might be presentation of examples of successful strategies by other producers, particularly in peer groups. In addition, veterinarians should provide the tools and guidance needed to produce economic gain, reduction of risks associated with residues and resistance, and positive experiences when using the tactics."
https://openalex.org/W2972993412,"Ikzf1 is a Kruppel-like zinc-finger transcription factor that plays indispensable roles in T and B cell development. Although the function of Ikzf1 has been studied extensively, the molecular mechanism underlying T lymphopoiesis remains incompletely defined during the embryonic stage. Here we report that the genetic ablation of ikzf1 in mutant zebrafish resulted in abrogated embryonic T lymphopoiesis. This was ascribed to impaired thymic migration, proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Ccr9a and Irf4a, two indispensable factors in T lymphopoiesis, were the direct targets of Ikzf1 and were absent in the ikzf1 mutants. Genetic deletion of either ccr9a or irf4a in the corresponding mutant embryos led to obvious T cell development deficiency, which was mainly caused by disrupted thymic migration of HSPCs. Restoration of ccr9a in ikzf1 mutants obviously promoted HSPC thymus homing. However, the HSPCs then failed to differentiate into T cells. Additional replenishment of irf4a efficiently induced HSPC proliferation and T cell differentiation. Our findings further demonstrate that Ikzf1 regulates embryonic T lymphopoiesis via Ccr9 and Irf4 and provide new insight into the genetic network of T lymphocyte development."
https://openalex.org/W2972608117,"The ecological success of shallow water reef-building corals has been linked to the symbiosis between the coral host and its dinoflagellate symbionts (herein ‘symbionts’). As mixotrophs, symbiotic corals depend on nutrients 1) transferred from their photosynthetic symbionts (autotrophy) and 2) acquired by host feeding on particulate organic resources (heterotrophy). However, coral species differ in the extent to which they depend on heterotrophy for nutrition and these differences are typically poorly defined. Here, a multi-tracer fatty acid approach was used to evaluate the trophic strategies of three species of common reef-building coral (Galaxea fascicularis, Pachyseris speciosa, and Pocillopora verrucosa) whose trophic strategies had previously been identified using carbon stable isotopes. The composition and various indices of fatty acids were compared to examine the relative contribution of symbiont autotrophy and host heterotrophy in coral energy acquisition. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to estimate the contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived from various potential sources to the coral hosts. The total fatty acid composition and fatty acid indices revealed differences between the more heterotrophic (P. verrucosa) and more autotrophic (P. speciosa) coral hosts, with the coral host G. fascicularis showing overlap with the other two species and greater variability overall. For the more heterotrophic P. verrucosa, the fatty acid indices and LDA results both indicated a greater proportion of copepod-derived fatty acids compared to the other coral species. Overall, the LDA estimated that PUFA derived from particulate resources (e.g., copepods and diatoms) comprised a greater proportion of coral host PUFA in contrast to the lower proportion of symbiont-derived PUFA. These estimates provide insight into the importance of heterotrophy in coral nutrition, especially in productive reef systems. The study supports carbon stable isotope results and demonstrates the utility of fatty acid analyses for exploring the trophic strategies of reef-building corals."
https://openalex.org/W2972336590,"Perspective-taking is essential for improving intergroup relations. However, it is difficult to implement, especially in violent conflicts. Given that immersive virtual reality (VR) can simulate various points of view (POV), we examined whether it can lead to beneficial outcomes by promoting outgroup perspective-taking, even in armed conflicts. In two studies, Jewish-Israelis watched a 360° VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs–outgroup’s, ingroup’s while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroup’s without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroup’s POV, but not those who imagined the outgroup’s perspective, perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroup’s POV. Moreover, participants in the outgroup’s POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroup’s POV, even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking."

To this end, halogen-substituted alkanes attached to diverse fluorophores are commercially available that allow specific, irreversible labeling of HaloTag fusion proteins; however, measurement of protein of interest half-life by pulse-chase of HaloTag ligands is not widely employed because residual unbound ligand continues to label newly synthesized HaloTag fusions even after extensive washing.

We identified 7-bromoheptanol as a high-affinity, low-toxicity HaloTag-blocking agent that permits protein turnover measurements at both the cell population (by blotting) and single-cell (by imaging) levels.

The ability to label proteins in living cells has revolutionized our understanding of many cellular processes. Several different self-labeling proteins have been developed, including SNAP-tag (1Keppler A. Gendreizig S. Gronemeyer T. Pick H. Vogel H. Johnsson K.

These tags are usually expressed fused to a specific protein of interest (POI), 2The abbreviations used are: POIprotein of interestTMRtetramethylrhodamine6CHO6-chlorohexanol6CHA6-chlorohexanoic acid5CVA5-chlorovaleric acid7BRO7-bromoheptanolCHXcycloheximideDCXdoublecortinCIconfidence interval. allowing labeling and monitoring of the POI's localization in living cells (2Los G.V.

There is growing interest in the use of self-labeling proteins for super-resolution microscopy (4Liss V. Barlag B. Nietschke M. Hensel M.

HaloTag is an engineered haloalkane hydrolase in which His-272 in the substrate-binding pocket is mutated to Phe. This mutation blocks hydrolysis and, instead, covalently attaches the HaloTag ligand to Asp-106 (2Los G.V. Encell L.P. McDougall M.G. Hartzell D.D. Karassina N. Zimprich C. Wood M.G. Learish R.

Commercially available ligands feature a variety of reporters that enable a wide array of assays, including protein purification and cell imaging. For instance, HaloTag has been used to study the turnover of connexin 36 at gap junctions (6Wang H.Y. Lin Y.P. Mitchell C.K. Ram S. O'Brien J. Two-color fluorescent analysis of connexin 36 turnover: relationship to functional plasticity.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 (26359298): 3888-389710.1242/jcs.162586Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, more recently, the requirement of CHMP2A as a regulator of autophagosome function (7Takahashi Y.

Commun. 2018; 9 (30030437)285510.1038/s41467-018-05254-wCrossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These studies highlight the utility of HaloTag (8England C.G. Luo H. Cai W. HaloTag technology: a versatile platform for biomedical applications.Bioconjug. Chem. 2015; 26 (25974629): 975-98610.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00191Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Direct labeling of HaloTag POIs in living cells has proven useful to monitor their location and determine the rate of protein turnover. However, in pulse-chase experiments, it has been observed that, even after removal of the TMR HaloTag ligand and rinsing with new medium, cells still contain unbound HaloTag ligand that will continue to label newly synthesized proteins (9Yamaguchi K. Inoue S. Ohara O. Nagase T. Pulse-chase experiment for the analysis of protein stability in cultured mammalian cells by covalent fluorescent labeling of fusion proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 577 (19718513): 121-13110.1007/978-1-60761-232-2_10Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The addition of another HaloTag ligand at a higher concentration (1000-fold) was necessary to outcompete the residual HaloTag ligand (9Yamaguchi K. Inoue S. Ohara O. Nagase T. Pulse-chase experiment for the analysis of protein stability in cultured mammalian cells by covalent fluorescent labeling of fusion proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 577 (19718513): 121-13110.1007/978-1-60761-232-2_10Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Presumably because of the cost of labeled HaloTag ligands, only one pulse-chase study involving single-cell imaging has been reported so far (6Wang H.Y. Lin Y.P. Mitchell C.K. Ram S. O'Brien J. Two-color fluorescent analysis of connexin 36 turnover: relationship to functional plasticity.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128 (26359298): 3888-389710.1242/jcs.162586Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here we identify an inexpensive, readily available HaloTag ligand that can be used as a blocker to prevent further labeling of newly synthesized HaloTag fusion proteins, enabling economical HaloTag pulse-chase experiments. We report both blotting and imaging-based protein turnover assays and show that the low toxicity of the blocker enables long-term analysis of stable proteins that cannot be studied with protein synthesis inhibitors. Using the structure of the reactive chloroalkane linker from commercial HaloTag ligands (Promega) as a search template (Fig. 1A), we identified a list of haloalkanes that may also interact with HaloTag. This list was filtered by solubility and predicted cell permeability profiles, and four haloalkanes were obtained from chemical vendors for further characterization: 6-chlorohexanol (6CHO), 6-chlorohexanoic acid (6CHA), 5-chlorovaleric acid (5CVA) and 7-bromoheptanol (7BRO; Fig. 1A). These chemicals were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in medium to perform toxicity studies in both COS-1 cells and primary cortical cultures from rat embryos. The four compounds were well-tolerated up to at least 1 mm (Fig. 1, B and C). An LD50 could not be determined for 5CVA, which was nontoxic at the highest concentration tested. We next tested the efficacy of these compounds as HaloTag blockers. Using HaloTag pulse-chase followed by Western blot analysis, we determined the protein turnover of B’β, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), whose proteasomal degradation we examined previously using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B’β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol.

B’β with a C-terminal HaloTag (B’β-Halo) was expressed in COS-1 cells by transient transfection. B’β-Halo was pulse-labeled with 50 nm cell-permeable TMR-conjugated HaloTag ligand for 30 min, which results in maximal labeling, as determined in prior experiments. The medium was removed and replaced with medium containing increasing concentrations of the four unlabeled haloalkanes for 8 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorescence imaging to detect residual TMR-labeled B’β-Halo; the same blots were then immunoblotted for total B’β-Halo for normalization. As reported previously for a different POI (9Yamaguchi K. Inoue S. Ohara O. Nagase T. Pulse-chase experiment for the analysis of protein stability in cultured mammalian cells by covalent fluorescent labeling of fusion proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 577 (19718513): 121-13110.1007/978-1-60761-232-2_10Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), replacing the medium without blocker resulted in very little decrease in TMR-labeled B’β-Halo over the 8-h chase period (Fig. 2A), implying retention of free ligand in the cell that continues to label newly synthesized HaloTag. Addition of any of the four haloalkanes at the highest concentrations reduced the amount of TMR-labeled B’β-Halo protein, indicating that they are indeed HaloTag ligands. 7BRO was by far the most effective blocker, with an IC50 close to the concentration of the TMR label (52 nm; Fig. 2, A, B, and D). To test the four HaloTag blockers on a different POI, we turned to doublecortin (DCX), a microtubule-binding protein critical for normal brain development (11Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein and is expressed widely by migrating neurons.Neuron. 1999; 23 (10399933): 257-27110.1016/S0896-6273(00)80778-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Based on pilot experiments indicating a longer half-life in COS-1 cells, turnover of doublecortin with a C-terminal HaloTag (DCX-Halo) was assayed after a 24-h chase period. Again, 7BRO was an effective haloalkane blocking agent, with an IC50 of 118 nm for DCX-Halo (Fig. 2, C and D). The remaining blockers were ineffective at blocking continued labeling of DCX-Halo by residual TMR ligand. These data indicate that 7BRO is a nontoxic, high-affinity blocker of HaloTag labeling by the TMR ligand, likely acting as a competitor at the substrate-binding site. With such varied effectiveness of the four haloalkanes tested, we asked whether this was due to differences in binding to the HaloTag or perhaps bioavailability in cells. Therefore, we expressed biotinylated recombinant HaloTag protein in Escherichia coli to perform in vitro competition binding assays between the TMR ligand (2 nm) and increasing concentrations of the four haloalkanes. 7BRO was highly effective at competing with the TMR ligand, with an IC50 of approximately four times the TMR ligand concentration; 6CHA was partially effective, whereas 6CHO and 5CVA were ineffective, even at 1000-fold higher concentration (Fig. 3, A and B). To test whether the ineffective haloalkanes can bind to HaloTag at all, we pretreated HaloTag protein (1 nm) with the blockers at 100 μm for 30 min prior to addition of 2 nm TMR ligand. If the binding of the haloalkanes to the HaloTag protein is irreversible, then this pretreatment should prevent TMR labeling. With pretreatment, all four haloalkanes were able to block TMR labeling of HaloTag but to variable extents. Although preincubation with 7BRO, 6CHO, and 6CHA prevented TMR labeling completely, 5CHA reduced labeling by only one-third (Fig. 3, C and D). These data indicate that all four haloalkanes are capable of blocking the HaloTag protein but that only 7BRO approaches the affinity of the TMR ligand. We previously identified Kelch-like 15 (KLHL15) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein that mediates proteasomal degradation of the B’β (PPP2R5B) subunit of PP2A and used the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX to determine turnover rates (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B’β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol.

Confounding the use of global protein synthesis inhibitors for turnover assays are cellular toxicity and secondary effects that affect the stability of the POI and thus mask its true half-life (12Dai C.L. Shi J. Chen Y. Iqbal K. Liu F. Gong C.X. Inhibition of protein synthesis alters protein degradation through activation of protein kinase B (AKT).J. Biol.

These secondary effects include degradation of deubiquitinases and even the POI’s E3 ubiquitin ligase itself (13Yewdell J.W. Lacsina J.R. Rechsteiner M.C. Nicchitta C.V. Out with the old, in with the new? Comparing methods for measuring protein degradation.Cell Biol. Int. 2011; 35 (21476986): 457-46210.1042/CBI20110055Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Initially, we compared the B’β-Halo turnover rate with either a control GFP-tagged protein or GFP-KLHL15 in cotransfected COS-1 cells, pulse-labeling with TMR ligand (50 nm) and chasing with or without the blocker 7BRO (10 μm) for up to 8 h. As expected (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B’β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol.

Without 7BRO, the apparent t½ for B’β-Halo increased by 2- to 3-fold under the two transfection conditions, highlighting the necessity of an effective blocker (Fig. 4, A and B). Of note, the half-lives of B’β with (2.8 h) and without KLHL15 overexpression (5.8 h) determined by HaloTag ligand pulse and 7BRO chase are very similar to those obtained by inhibiting protein synthesis in HEK293 cells (2.5 h and ∼8 h, respectively) (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B’β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol.

This agreement is despite the fact that the E3 ligase KLHL15 significantly degrades over time in CHX (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S.

We next assayed turnover of the long-lived DCX protein in COS-1 cells to compare the effectiveness of CHX chase and HaloTag pulse-chase protocols. As with B’β, the apparent t½ of DCX-Halo without 7BRO chase was more than twice the t½ when it was included (12 h; Fig. 5, A and B). Over the 24-h time course, no change was seen in total DCX-Halo or total protein (ERK1/2 loading control; Fig. 5A). In contrast, when we inhibited protein synthesis with increasing doses of CHX (10–100 μg/ml), the apparent degradation of DCX protein at higher CHX concentrations paralleled the loss of total protein over the 24-h time course (Ponceau S; Fig. 5C). Thus, CHX toxicity precluded estimation of DCX protein degradation rates in COS-1 cells (Fig. 5D), suggesting that HaloTag pulse-chase is the method of choice for measuring the turnover of long-lived proteins. After demonstrating the effectiveness of 7BRO as an effective HaloTag blocker for cell population analysis by SDS-PAGE, we next examined the use of the blocker for imaging-based assays of protein turnover in individual cells. To this end, we transfected primary rat hippocampal neurons with B’β-Halo or DCX-Halo, labeled cultures with TMR ligand and chased for variables times with medium with or without 7BRO. Cultures were then fixed and immunofluorescently labeled for the transfected proteins (Fig. 6, A and C). As before, chasing with 7BRO increased the apparent rate of B’β and DCX turnover, although less dramatically so for the latter protein (Fig. 6, B and D). Interestingly, turnover of B’β (t½ = 2.7 h) and especially DCX (t½ = 3.6 h) was faster in neurons than in COS-1 cells (t½ = 5.8 h and 12 h, respectively; Fig. 4). Because both B’β and DCX are most highly expressed in the nervous system (11Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A. Doublecortin is a microtubule-associated protein and is expressed widely by migrating neurons.Neuron. 1999; 23 (10399933): 257-27110.1016/S0896-6273(00)80778-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar, 14Saraf A.

In conclusion, HaloTag pulse-chase with 7BRO is a robust and economical method to measure protein turnover in both easy- and hard-to-transfect cell types. Specific labeling of fusion proteins containing the HaloTag with a variety of reporters has been adopted for a diverse array of applications, including turnover studies (2Los G.V. Encell L.P.

However, a limitation of the technology, at least for hydrophobic, cell-permeant HaloTag ligands, is their retention in cells after removal from the medium, where they continue to label newly synthesized POIs. Previous studies utilized an additional HaloTag ligand containing a different functional group at higher concentrations to outcompete the residual labeling ligand (9Yamaguchi K. Inoue S. Ohara O. Nagase T. Pulse-chase experiment for the analysis of protein stability in cultured mammalian cells by covalent fluorescent labeling of fusion proteins.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 577 (19718513): 121-13110.1007/978-1-60761-232-2_10Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although this technique is effective, it dramatically increases the cost of experiments and precludes widespread adoption of HaloTag technology for protein turnover studies. In this report, we identified an inexpensive (<1 cent/24 well plate), widely available, and high-affinity ligand for the HaloTag that is well-tolerated by cell lines and primary neurons and effectively blocks the continued labeling of new synthesized proteins. Using 7BRO as a blocker, we were able to reliably measure protein turnover of two POIs both by SDS-PAGE analysis and single-neuron imaging. HaloTag pulse-chase for protein turnover assays using Western blot analysis has significant advantages over commonly used assays in which cells are treated with CHX or similar inhibitors (15Kao S.H. Wang W.L. Chen C.Y. Chang Y.L. Wu Y.Y. Wang Y.T. Wang S.P. Nesvizhskii A.I. Chen Y.J. Hong T.M. Yang P.C. Analysis of protein stability by the cycloheximide chase assay.Bio. Protoc. 2015; 5 (29082276)e1374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first is avoiding the toxicity of shutting down global protein synthesis, which is of critical importance for long-lived proteins. Second, total protein levels of the POI and, more importantly, of the degrading machinery responsible for turning over the POI are unchanged by addition of the HaloTag ligand and blocker. Last, it avoids confounding activation of AKT signaling and transcription factor activation in response to CHX treatment, which was reported recently (12Dai C.L. Shi J. Chen Y. Iqbal K. Liu F. Gong C.X. Inhibition of protein synthesis alters protein degradation through activation of protein kinase B (AKT).J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288 (23843462): 23875-2388310.1074/jbc.M112.445148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These advantages are shared with other pulse-chase methods, such as labeling with radioactive amino acids. However, HaloTag pulse-chase does not require affinity purification of the POI prior to analysis of label incorporation and is therefore compatible with high-throughput applications. HaloTag is derived from a bacterial enzyme, so it is unlikely that mammalian cells have evolved the machinery for its targeted degradation. Indeed, at least for the PP2A subunit B’β, whose turnover we determined by both CHX chase (10Oberg E.A. Nifoussi S.K. Gingras A.C. Strack S. Selective proteasomal degradation of the B’β subunit of protein phosphatase 2A by the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Kelch-like 15.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (23135275): 43378-4338910.1074/jbc.M112.420281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and HaloTag pulse-chase (Fig. 4), fusion to the ∼33-kDa HaloTag does not alter protein stability, although this may have to be verified for other POIs. Potential other applications for 7BRO with HaloTag labeling include estimation of the protein synthesis rate in cells in which the HaloTag is integrated into the genomic locus encoding the endogenous POI. In this scenario, existing POI HaloTag fusion protein is blocked with a low dose of 7BRO, followed by addition of HaloTag ligand for different periods of time at slightly higher concentrations to label only the newly synthesized POI. In summary, we have identified 7BRO as an economical HaloTag-blocking agent that can compete with commercially available HaloTag ligands attached to highly sensitive reporters. HaloTag ligand pulse followed by 7BRO chase is nontoxic and offers advantages over traditional methods of protein turnover determination, especially for long-lived proteins. The human B’β and DCX complementary DNAs were cloned into the pHTC vector (Promega), also incorporating a HiBiT, myc, and FLAG tag between the N-terminal complementary DNA and the C-terminal HaloTag. The chemical reagents used in this study were procured as follows: 7-bromoheptanol from Alfa Aesar (catalog no. H54762), 6-chlorohexanoic acid from Ark Pharm Inc. (catalog no.

COS-1 cells were cultured (37 °C and 5% CO2) in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% (v/v) GlutaMax (Gibco). Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from E18 rat embryos (16Lim I.A. Merrill M.A. Chen Y. Hell J.W. Disruption of the NMDA receptor–PSD-95 interaction in hippocampal neurons with no obvious physiological short-term effect.Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45 (14529713): 738-75410.1016/S0028-3908(03)00276-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in Neurobasal complete (Neurobasal medium (Gibco), 2% B27 supplement (Gibco), 10 mm Hepes, and 0.25% GlutaMax), and half of the medium was replaced with new medium twice a week. For the high-concentration doses, reagents were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in complete medium. For the acids, stocks were dissolved in plain medium and neutralized with concentrated HCl before dilution in complete medium. For the lethal dose survival assays, a CellTiter-Blue assay was performed after 24-h treatment with the haloalkanes as specified by the manufacturer (Promega, catalog no. G8081). COS-1 cells were grown to 70%–80% confluency, seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml on collagen-coated plates, and transfected with HaloTag vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacture’s protocol for transient transfection of adhered cells. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with a final concentration of 50 nm cell-permeant HaloTag® TMR ligand at 37 °C for 30 min for maximum labeling. Then the medium was removed completely and replaced with medium containing different blockers at the indicated concentrations. Blockers were made as 10 mm stocks in DMEM before dilution to the final concentration in DMEM plus serum. Then cells were returned to the incubator for the indicated time periods before washing with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (Gibco) and harvested in Laemmli sample buffer, followed by sonication to shear genomic DNA. SDS-PAGE was performed to separate HaloTag proteins, and TMR fluorescence was detected by the FLA-7000 Image Reader (Fujifilm) or Sapphire (Azure) using appropriate laser excitation and emission filters. Total cell lysates were also probed for B’β, DCX, FLAG, GFP, and ERK1/2 (loading control) antibodies. Relative TMR labeling was quantified by dividing TMR fluorescence signals by B’β or DCX immunoblotting signals in the same lane and normalizing to the zero time point (set to 1) in ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The t½ of B’β and DCX was estimated by the one-phase decay model (nonlinear regression, plateau = 0) using GraphPad Prism software. HaloTag protein containing a C-terminal AviTag (for biotinylation) was expressed in BL-21 cells (Agilent, catalog no. 200131). Soluble bacterial extract was diluted to 1 nm HaloTag protein (estimated by SDS-PAGE of BSA protein standards) and incubated for 30 min with a premixed combination of haloalkanes at varying concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μm) and 2 nm TMR HaloTag ligand. For pretreatment, 100 μm tested haloalkane was incubated for 30 min with 1 nm HaloTag protein before addition of 2 nm TMR ligand. After SDS-PAGE, the fluorescence of TMR and biotin (via Streptavidin-DyLight® 800) was detected on the same blot for ratiometric quantitation. Cultures were transfected using 0.25 μg of DNA/0.5 μl of NeuroMag/well at 9 days in vitro. The replacement medium always consisted of half new neurobasal complete and half conditioned medium. Three days after transfection, cultures were incubated with 100 nm TMR HaloTag ligand for at least 45 min prior to removal of the medium and addition of replacement blank medium or 7BRO-containing medium for the designated times. Fixed hippocampal cultures were blocked for 30 min with 200 μl of 4% normal donkey serum in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 190 μl of 1:400 dilutions of antibody against the DDK (FLAG) tag. Following washes (2 × 750-μl Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TTBS) rinse, 2 × 750-μl of TTBS wash for 10 min), cultures were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 190 μl of 1:250 dilution of the DyLight® 350-conjugated secondary antibody. Cultured neurons were viewed on a Leica DMI4000B epifluorescence microscope with a ×40 oil objective following washes (2 × 750-μl TTBS rinse, 2 × 750-μl TTBS wash for 10 min, 1 × 750-μl PBS rinse, stored in 500 μl of PBS). A 2.5:1 gain ratio, 3:1 exposure time ratio, and 2:1 exposure intensity ratio for blue and red channels, respectively, remained constant across imaging for all experiments and conditions. Captured wide-field epifluorescence images were analyzed using ImageJ software, measuring the integrated density of neuronal cell bodies in the red (TMR) and blue (FLAG antibody) channels. The ratio of blue intensity minus a control background selection to red intensity minus a control background selection was calculated as a measure of relative TMR labeling of the expressed HaloTag fusion protein. The robust outlier removal (ROUT) method of removing outliers was used at Q = 1% prior to normalization of data to the 0-h time point for each experimental condition. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, followed by Tukey post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. Dose–response data were fitted by a one-phase exponential decay curve using the least squares method. All analyses were carried out using GraphPad Prism software. R. A. M. and S.

https://openalex.org/W2973096894,"Inflammatory processes have been shown to modify tryptophan (Trp) metabolism. Gut microbiota appears to play a significant role in the induction of peripheral and central inflammation. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure alters gut permeability, but its effects on Trp metabolism and the involvement of gut microbiota have not been studied. We analyzed several parameters of gut-barrier and of peripheral and central Trp metabolism following 2 different EtOH consumption patterns in mice, the binge model, drinking in the dark (DID), and the chronic intermittent (CI) consumption paradigm. Antibiotic treatment was used to evaluate gut microbiota involvement in the CI model. Mice exposed to CI EtOH intake, but not DID, show bacterial translocation and increased plasma LPS immediately after EtOH removal. Gut-barrier permeability to FITC-dextran is increased by CI, and, furthermore, intestinal epithelial tight-junction (TJ) disruption is observed (decreased expression of zonula occludens 1 and occludin) associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity and iNOS expression. CI EtOH, but not DID, increases kynurenine (Kyn) levels in plasma and limbic forebrain. Intestinal bacterial decontamination prevents the LPS increase but not the permeability to FITC-dextran, TJ disruption, or the increase in MMP-9 activity and iNOS expression. Although plasma Kyn levels are not affected by antibiotic treatment, the elevation of Kyn in brain is prevented, pointing to an involvement of microbiota in CI EtOH-induced changes in brain Trp metabolism. Additionally, CI EtOH produces depressive-like symptoms of anhedonia, which are prevented by the antibiotic treatment thus pointing to an association between anhedonia and the increase in brain Kyn and to the involvement of gut microbiota.-Giménez-Gómez, P., Pérez-Hernández, M., O'Shea, E., Caso, J.

Thereby PROTACs rewire the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to rapidly eliminate, rather than inhibit, specific target proteins on contact, which could minimize the risk that acquired defects develop over time and also phenotypes are reversed, common shortcomings of targeted therapies.

However, one major caveat with these degradation signals employed is the lack of degradation speed control, which can be a problem as too fast or slow substrate turnover may be harmful in some cases. It is also important to reduce the sizes of PROTACs that currently are much larger than typical drugs (often less than 500 Da), which could improve cellular permeability and potency. Moreover, the ubiquitin ligases Cereblon and VHL, which are most frequently employed in PROTACs currently, may not be easily adopted for cancers in kidney, lung, and brain, due to their low expression/activity in these cells (9Sekido Y.

Therefore, how to expand the repertoire of ubiquitin ligases and make this strategy more generally applicable remains a critical, pressing issue. We reason that a short binding motif to a potent ubiquitin ligase may greatly improve the utility of the PROTAC approach. The shortest degradation motif is a single amino acid, a destabilizing residue (e.g. Arg, His, Lys, Leu, and Ile) at the N terminus of a protein that targets the substrate to a ubiquitin ligase termed Ubr1 for rapid degradation via the N-end rule pathway, the first ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway identified (12Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. In vivo half-life of a protein is a function of its amino-terminal residue.Science. 1986; 234 (3018930): 179-18610.1126/science.3018930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 13Varshavsky A.

Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2019; 10 (31024446): 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). ERRα inhibition has been shown to reduce the proliferation of breast tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that both compounds Arg-TERRa and His-TERRa reduced the endogenous ERRα level in the MCF-7 metastatic breast cancer cell line (Fig. 1B). To assess whether the ERRα decrease was due to protein turnover, we treated the cells with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis and collected the samples at various time points for Western blot analysis. Both Arg-TERRa and His-TERRa triggered ERRα degradation (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). We then evaluated whether PROTAC-induced ERRα degradation is mediated by the proteasome. We found that Arg-TERRa– or His-TERRa–triggered ERRα turnover was compromised upon the treatment of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2, A and B, and Fig. S2), suggesting the involvement of the proteasome in ERRα turnover. To ascertain that ERRα is degraded by the N-end rule pathway, we took advantage that dipeptides starting with a destabilizing residue (e.g. Arg, His) can block the degradation of N-end rule substrates through their competition for the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 (13Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system, autophagy, and regulated protein degradation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86 (28654326): 123-12810.1146/annurev-biochem-061516-044859Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 14Tasaki T. Sriram S.M. Park K.S. Kwon Y.T. The N-end rule pathway.Annu. Rev.

We found that the PROTAC-exposed ERRα level was increased upon the addition of the dipeptide Arg-Ala or His-Ala, but not the control peptide Ala-Ala bearing a stabilizing residue (Fig. 2, C and D, and Fig. S3). We next examined the biological effects of the PROTAC molecules in MCF-7 cells. Both compounds led to decreased proliferation of MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). As cell migration is key to tumorigenesis, we then evaluated whether the compounds affect cell motility by the scratch wound healing method and the ThinCert cell migration assay. We found both Arg-TERRa and His-TERRa reduced MCF-7 cancer cell migration and wound repair (Fig. 3, B and C, and Fig. S4). Furthermore, we monitored the expression of several markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that is crucial for cancer cell migration and invasion. PROTACs led to increased expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of N-cadherin, SNAIL, and fibronectin (Fig. 3D), indicating EMT is repressed upon ERRα depletion. Combined, these results suggest that Arg-TERRa and His-TERRa could effectively modulate ERRα and be explored for anticancer purpose. Our study demonstrates that the N-end rule-based PROTACs efficiently trigger target destruction and inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells. The advantage of our approach lies in the use of the simplest degradation signal-single amino acid, which can be any one of the 13 destabilizing residues in the N-end rule pathway (13Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system, autophagy, and regulated protein degradation.Annu. Rev.

The PROTAC method presented here overcomes limitations of existing approaches with significantly smaller molecular size of E3 targeting moiety, likely leading to higher permeability and better efficacy, and a modulatable potent degradation activity, allowing better control and broader application. Furthermore, the N-end rule degradation pathway is universally present and constitutively active, making it ideally suited for the PROTAC approach. This modular design expands the repertoire of limited ubiquitin pathways currently available for PROTACs and could be easily adapted for broad use in targeted protein degradation. The MCF-7 cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm l-glutamine that was modified to contain 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1.5 g/liter of sodium bicarbonate. It was also supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml of bovine insulin, and 100 units/μl of penicillin/streptomycin. All drug treatment studies were supplemented with 2% FBS. Functional assays, including MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), migration assays were done in 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Details of Arg-TERRa and His-TERRa syntheses are described under supporting information. Dipeptides Arg-Ala and His-Ala were purchased from Bachem Americas (Torrance, CA). MG132 is a proteasome inhibitor obtained from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ). Cycloheximide and dipeptide Ala-Ala were purchased from Sigma. The MTT method was used to measure living cells through mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (Sigma). Cells were plated in a 96-well plate, 5000 cells/100 μl/well. After 24 h, the cells were treated with PROTACs in fresh medium. At the indicated time point, the medium was removed and DMSO was added as MTT solubilization solution, followed by 100 μl of stop solution. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma) with the addition of protease inhibitors tablet and phosphatase inhibitors mixture (Sigma). Lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and then probed with antibodies as indicated. Antibodies against ERRα, E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, Snail, and GAPDH were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Fibronectin antibody was obtained from Sigma. Cells were allowed to grow to near confluence in 6-well dishes. A uniform scratch was then made down the center of the plate using a 200-μl micropipette tip, followed by washing twice with PBS. The same marked field of the scratch wound was photographed using an Olympus light microscope (×4 objective) at the indicated time points. The width of the scratch wound was measured at three different areas with ImageJ software. MCF-7 cells (1 × 104) were seeded on an 8 μm pore size Thin-cert for 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One) in serum-free media. PROTAC compounds were added to the bottom chamber as chemoattractant. After 48 h, cells on the top of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. The migrated cells at the bottom side were washed with PBS, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained using 0.1% crystal violet to visualize the migrated cells. Migrated cells attached to the lower side of the membrane were enumerated using a light microscope at ×10 magnification. K. S., P. S., H. C., B. C., S. F. M., and T. L. data curation; K. S. and H.

https://openalex.org/W2972457456,"Oxidative stresses intensify the progression of diabetes-related behavioural changes and testicular injuries. Graviola (Annona muricata), a small tree of the Annonaceae family, has been investigated for its protective effects against diabetic complications, oxidative stress, and neuropathies. This study was planned to investigate the effects of graviola on behavioural alterations and testicular oxidative status of streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg)-induced diabetic rats. Forty adult male Wistar rats were equally allocated into four groups: control (received normal saline 8 ml/kg orally once daily), diabetic (received normal saline orally once daily), graviola (GR; received 100 mg/kg/day; orally once daily), and diabetic with graviola (Diabetic+GR; received 100 mg/kg/day; once daily). Behavioural functions were assessed using standard behavioural paradigms. Also, oxidative statuses of testis were evaluated. Results of behavioural observations showed that diabetes induced depression-like behaviours, reduction of exploratory and locomotor activities, decreased memory performance, and increased stress-linked behaviours. These variations in diabetic rats were happened due to oxidative stress. Interestingly, treatment of diabetic rats with graviola for four weeks alleviated all behavioural changes due to diabetes. Also, rats in graviola-treated groups had greater testicular testosterone and estradiol levels compared with diabetic rats due to significant rise in testicular acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 expression. In the same context, graviola enhanced the antioxidant status of testicular tissues by significantly restoring the testicular glutathione and total superoxide dismutase that fell during diabetes. In addition, Graviola significantly decreased the expression of apoptotic (Bax) and inflammatory (interleukin-1β) testicular genes. In conclusion, these data propose that both the hypoglycemic and antioxidative potential of graviola are possible mechanisms that improve behavioural alterations and protect testis in diabetic animals. Concomitantly, further clinical studies in human are required to validate the current study."

Prisons are a key location to identify, treat and prevent HCV infection among people who inject drugs (PWID). Understanding prisoners’ lived experiences of the HCV continuum of care informs how HCV care can be effectively delivered to this marginalised and high-risk population. This study aimed to explore Irish prisoners’ experience of prison and community-based HCV care. We conducted one-to-one interviews with 25 male prisoners with chronic HCV infection. Data collection and analysis was informed by grounded theory. The mean age of participants and first incarceration was 39.5 and 18.3 years respectively. The mean number of incarcerations was eight. The following themes were identified: medical and social factors influencing engagement (fear of treatment and lack of knowledge, HCV relevance and competing priorities), adverse impact of HCV on health and wellness, positive experience of prison life and health care and the transformative clinical and non-clinical changes associated with HCV treatment and cure. Findings suggest that prison release was associated with multiple stressors including homelessness and drug dependence which quickly eroded the health benefits gained during incarceration. The study generated a substantive theory of the need to increase the importance of HCV care among the routine competing priorities associated with the lives of PWID. HCV infected prisoners often lead complex lives and understanding their journeys through the HCV continuum can inform the development of meaningful HCV care pathways. Many challenges exist to optimising HCV treatment uptake in this group and incarceration is an opportunity to successfully engage HCV infected prisoners who underutilise and are underserved by community-based medical services. Support and linkage to care on release is essential to optimising HCV management."

In this study, the spatial variability of soil REEs in Zhuxi watershed, Changting County, southern China, was analyzed using a geostatistics method. The analysis produced several important results: (1) The content of total rare earth elements (TREEs) in the soil samples ranged from 56.04 to 951.76 mg kg−1, with a mean value of 255.34 mg kg−1, which was higher than the background value of soil in China. The REE variables showed strong positive Ce anomalies and strong negative Eu anomalies, with mean values of 2.26 and 0.44, respectively. (2) The contents of TREEs in five subtypes of the soils were different, but they had broadly similar curves of chondrite-normalized REE patterns, with steeper patterns from La to Eu and flatter patterns from Eu to Y. (3) The spatial variability of light rare earth elements (LREEs) was mainly affected by natural factors, but the spatial variabilities of heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) and TREEs were influenced by the combination of natural factors and anthropogenic factors. Soil erosion can contribute significantly to REE migration, especially for HREEs. (4) The distribution of TREEs showed that the high content of TREEs was in the lowland of the western watershed. By comparing the distributions of TREEs in paddy fields and hilly land, we found that the area with a high content of TREEs was greater in paddy fields than in hilly land, so we deduced that REEs migrate from hilly land to the paddy field and accumulate in the soil there."

Firstly, a zebrafish alcoholic liver injury model was established using1.0mM of ethanol concentration, then two forms of lactobacillus plantarum treatment were designed to perform repair, including a lactobacillus plantarum thallus suspension (LPS) and a lactobacillus plantarum thallus breaking solution (LPBS). After 24h of alcohol injury, lactobacillus plantarum concentrations of 0, 1.0×105, 1.0×106, 1.0×107 and 1.5×107 cfu/mL were added to protect zebrafish larvae. Then with the treatment of lactobacillus plantarum after 48h, activities of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in zebrafish tissue homogenate were respectively determined. Keap-Nrf2-ARE signal pathway related gene expression conditions were also analyzed, including nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2(Nrf2), Kelch like ECH associated protein 1(Keap1), catalase(CAT), hemooxygenase1(HO1) and Glutathione S-Transferase Kappa 1(gstk1). Results showed that: in comparison with the control group, the LPBS with dosage of 1.0×107 cfu/mL remarkably improved the activities of SOD, CAT, HO1and gstk1 in zebrafish larvae liver (P<0.05), resulting in significant increase of the protein expression level of Nrf2 (225.78%) and suppression of Keap1 gene expression (73.67%)(P<0.01). As confirmed by the results, lactobacillus plantarum activated the Keap-Nrf2-ARE signal pathway from the level of transcription, the up-regulation of the expression quantity of Nrf2 protected the organism from oxidative stress and maximally reduced liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2972434591,"Iron (Fe) is an important growth factor for diatoms and its availability is further restricted by changes in the carbonate chemistry of seawater. We investigated the physiological attributes and transcriptional profiles of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana grown on a day: night cycle under different CO2/pH and iron concentrations, that in combination generated available iron (Fe’) concentrations of 1160, 233, 58 and 12 pM. We found the light-dark conditions to be the main driver of transcriptional patterns, followed by Fe’ concentration and CO2 availability, respectively. At the highest Fe’ (1160 pM), 55% of the transcribed genes were differentially expressed between day and night, whereas at the lowest Fe’ (12 pM), only 28% of the transcribed genes displayed comparable patterns. While Fe limitation disrupts the diel expression patterns for genes in most central metabolism pathways, the diel expression of light- signaling molecules and glycolytic genes was relatively robust in response to reduced Fe’. Moreover, we identified a non-canonical splicing of transcripts encoding triose-phosphate isomerase, a key-enzyme of glycolysis, generating transcript isoforms that would encode proteins with and without an active site. Transcripts that encoded an active enzyme maintained a diel expression at low Fe’, while transcripts that encoded the non-active enzyme lost the diel expression. This work illustrates the interplay between nutrient limitation and transcriptional regulation over the diel cycle. Considering that future ocean conditions will reduce the availability of Fe in many parts of the oceans, our work identifies some of the regulatory mechanisms that may shape future ecological communities."

Bactrocera minax is an oligophagous tephritid insect whose host selection, and oviposition behavior largely depend on the perception of chemical cues. However, there have been very few reports on molecular components related to the olfactory system of B. minax. Therefore, the transcriptome of B. minax were sequenced in this study, with 1 candidate chemosensory protein (CSP), 21 candidate odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 53 candidate odorant receptors (ORs), 29 candidate ionotropic receptors (IRs) and 4 candidate sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs) being identified. After that, we sequenced the candidate olfactory genes and performed phylogenetic analysis. qRT-PCR was used to express and characterize 9 genes in olfactory and non-olfactory tissues. Compared with GFP-injected fly (control), dsOBP21-treated B. minax and dsCSP-treated B. minax had lower electrophysiological response to D-limonene (attractant), suggesting the potential involvement of BminOBP21 and BminCSP genes in olfactory perceptions of the fly. Our study establishes the molecular basis of olfaction, tributary for further functional analyses of chemosensory processes in B. minax."

Methods Three hundred eighteen eyes of 161 individuals with reliable visual fields (VF) were enrolled in this study. All participants were examined using the standard posterior pole and the pRNFL protocols of the Spectralis OCT device. VF impairment was graded in hemifields, and the GCL sectors were correlated with this damage. Thicknesses of each GCL, the GCL map deviation asymmetry and the pRNFL were compared between control and glaucomatous eyes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of these analyses was assessed. Results Fourteen of the 16 sectors of the GCL and pRNFL were significantly thinner in eyes with glaucoma than in control eyes (p<0.006). Similarly, the GCL map deviation showed a significant difference between these eyes and both the control eyes as well as the eyes with early glaucoma (p = 0.001 and p = 0.039, respectively). The highest values of AUC to diagnose both early and advanced glaucoma corresponded to the average pRNFL analysis and the GCL map deviation (AUC>0.823, p<0.040 and AUC>0.708, p<0.188, respectively). Conclusions Although 16 central sectors of the GCL observed with PPA showed good correlation with VF damage, the pRNFL and the GCL map deviation were more effective for discrimination of glaucomatous damage."
https://openalex.org/W2972655085,"Introduction To evaluate the consequences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) on academic outcomes and healthcare use in adolescents born very preterm. Methods This cohort study included 15-year-old adolescents born very preterm (< 32 weeks) between 2011 and 2013, with and without BPD, and controls born full term. Data regarding academic performance, current medical follow-up, and family characteristics were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to quantify relationships between academic outcomes and BPD. Results From the 1341 children included in the initial cohort, 985 adolescents were eligible and 351 included (55 preterms with a history of BPD, 249 without, and 47 controls). Among adolescents born very preterm, a history of BPD was associated with a higher risk to attend a school for children with special needs (p < 0.05) and to have repeated a grade (p = 0.01). It was also associated with an increased number of medical and paramedical consultations. A history of BPD was not associated with the parents’ employment status, family structure, or the presence of younger siblings. Conclusion This study highlights that a history of BPD is associated with poorer academic outcomes and high healthcare use in adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2972779233,"Agricultural development was the major contributor to South America’s designation as the continent with the highest rates of forest loss from 2000–2012. As the apex predator in the Neotropics, jaguars (Panthera onca) are dependent on forest cover but the species’ response to habitat fragmentation in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes has not been a subject of extensive research. We used occupancy as a measure of jaguar habitat use in Colombia’s middle Magdalena River valley which, as part of the intercontinental Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena biodiversity hotspot, is exceedingly fragmented by expanding cattle pastures and oil palm plantations. We used single-season occupancy models to analyze 9 months of data (2015–2016) from 70 camera trap sites. Given the middle Magdalena’s status as a “jaguar corridor” and our possible violation of the occupancy models’ demographic closure assumption, we interpreted our results as “probability of habitat use (Ψ)” by jaguars. We measured the associations between jaguar presence and coverage of forest, oil palm, and wetlands in radii buffers of 1, 3, and 5 km around each camera trap. Our camera traps recorded 77 jaguar detections at 25 of the camera trap sites (36%) during 15,305 trap nights. The probability of detecting jaguars, given their presence at a site, was 0.28 (0.03 SE). In the top-ranked model, jaguar habitat use was positively influenced by wetland coverage (β = 7.16, 3.20 SE) and negatively influenced by cattle pastures (β = -1.40, 0.63 SE), both in the 3 km buffers. We conclude that wetlands may serve as keystone habitats for jaguars in landscapes fragmented by cattle ranches and oil palm plantations. Greater focus on wetland preservation could facilitate jaguar persistence in one of the most important yet vulnerable areas of their distribution."

It has been shown previously that the associated β2 subunits promote cell surface expression of the α subunit. The major α isoform in the adult human heart is NaV1.5, and germline mutations in the NaV1.5-encoding gene, sodium voltage-gated channel α subunit 5 (SCN5A), often cause inherited arrhythmias. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate β2 trafficking and how they may determine proper NaV1.5 cell surface localization. Using heterologous expression in polarized Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, we show that β2 is N-glycosylated in vivo and in vitro at residues 42, 66, and 74, becoming sialylated only at Asn-42. We found that fully nonglycosylated β2 was mostly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that N-linked glycosylation is required for efficient β2 trafficking to the apical plasma membrane. The nonglycosylated variant reached the cell surface by bypassing the Golgi compartment at a rate of only approximately one-third of that of WT β2. YFP-tagged, nonglycosylated β2 displayed mobility kinetics in the plane of the membrane similar to that of WT β2. However, it was defective in promoting surface localization of NaV1.5.

Erythritol is of medical interest because elevated plasma levels of this polyol are predictive for visceral adiposity gain and development of type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms behind these associations remain unknown because the erythritol biosynthesis pathway, particularly the enzyme catalyzing the final step of erythritol synthesis (reduction of erythrose to erythritol), is not characterized. In this study, we purified two enzymes from rabbit liver capable of catalyzing the conversion of erythrose to erythritol: alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). Both recombinant human ADH1 and SORD reduce erythrose to erythritol, using NADPH as a co-factor, and cell culture studies indicate that this activity is primarily NADPH-dependent. We found that ADH1 variants vary markedly in both their affinity for erythrose and their catalytic capacity (turnover number). Interestingly, the recombinant protein produced from the ADH1B2 variant, common in Asian populations, is not active when NADPH is used as a co-factor in vitro. We also confirmed SORD contributes to intracellular erythritol production in human A549 lung cancer cells, where ADH1 is minimally expressed.

Currently, industrial erythritol production relies on biotechnological methods using bacterial, fungal, or yeast strains (1Rzechonek D.A. Dobrowolski A. Rymowicz W. Mirończuk A.M.

In eukaryotes, glucose is phosphorylated yielding glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which is subsequently converted to ribulose 5-phosphate in the oxidative part of the PPP. In the following, nonoxidative part of the PPP, carbon backbone rearrangements occur resulting in the formation of E4P. Prior to erythritol formation, E4P is dephosphorylated to erythrose and subsequently reduced in an NADPH-dependent manner to erythritol (1Rzechonek D.A. Dobrowolski A. Rymowicz W. Mirończuk A.M. Recent advances in biological production of erythritol.Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 2018; 38 (28954540): 620-63310.1080/07388551.2017.1380598Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

However, in humans, to our knowledge, the exact metabolic conversions among E4P, erythrose, and erythritol, as well as the identity of the catalyzing enzyme, are not described and remain unknown. In this study, we isolated from rabbit liver two distinct protein fractions capable of catalyzing conversion of erythrose to erythritol. In addition, we confirmed that the human recombinant forms of these enzymes also exhibit this activity, effectively identifying novel roles for two dehydrogenase proteins in glucose metabolism (Fig. 1). Hootman et al. (3Hootman K.C. Trezzi J.-P. Kraemer L. Kraemer L. Burnwell L.S. Dong X. Guertin K.A. Jaeger C. Stober P.J. Hiller K. Cassano P.A.

However, the enzyme responsible for the formation of erythritol in humans is not known. A colorimetric enzyme kinetics assay was used to determine the cofactor (NADH or NADPH) and the substrate (erythrose or E4P) required for erythritol synthesis in A549 lung cancer cells, in which erythritol production was previously detected (data not shown). Because the substrate must be reduced to form erythritol, the amount of reduced cofactor (NADH or NADPH, λmax = 340 nm) decreases as the reaction proceeds. Although the NADH level did not decrease during the time course of the assay, NADPH levels strongly decreased when erythrose and the cell lysate were present in the assay mixture (Fig. 2a, condition 1, black line). To ensure that the erythrose was converted to erythritol, we extracted the assay mixture at four different time points during the assay and measured the erythritol using GC-MS (Fig. 2b). Erythritol formation occurred only in the presence of NADPH and not in the presence of NADH, indicating that the enzyme of interest requires NADPH as a cofactor. A similar assay was used to determine the physiological substrate. These experiments revealed that erythrose, rather than E4P, is the substrate used by the target enzyme both with respect to NADPH consumption (Fig. 2a, black line) and erythritol formation in A549 cells (Fig. 2b, black line). Two distinct, pure protein fractions (Fig. 3) were purified from rabbit liver with NADPH-dependent erythrose reduction activity (Table 1), as described under “Experimental procedures.” After purification and SDS-PAGE, three protein bands were excised (the most prominent 37-kDa band from purified fraction “A” and two bands belonging to purified fraction “B1” and “B2”) and subjected to tryptic digestion. Peptides from each protein were separated using LC-MS/MS and subsequently identified as belonging to alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1, fraction A, Table 2) and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD, fraction B1, Table 3) based on the coverage of the protein from identified peptides and the “Sequest HT” scores. Although the protein with the highest Sequest HT score for the smaller band excised from fraction B2 (Table 4) was identified as 33-kDa glycine N-methyltransferase, it is likely this band is a degradation product of the larger 38-kDa SORD protein, which exhibited the second-highest Sequest HT score. First, glycine N-methyltransferase comprises a significant proportion (1%) of total soluble liver protein in mammals (16Mato J.M. Martínez-Chantar M.L. Lu S.C. Methionine metabolism and liver disease.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 273-29310.1146/annurev.nutr.28.061807.155438Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Second, the purification required several purification steps, all of which took place at room temperature over several days and included several freeze-thaw cycles of the liver fractions. Rabbit liver ADH1, fraction A, exhibited lower apparent Km values for erythrose than did rabbit liver SORD, fraction B1 (Table 1, Fig. S1). SORD, however, exhibited a much higher turnover number (kcat) than did ADH1, especially when NADPH was used as a cofactor (Table 1, Fig. S1).Table 1Kinetic characterization of protein fractions with erythrose reduction activity isolated from rabbit liverSubstrateCofactorApparent Kmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1m−1 s−1Fraction A, ADH1ErythroseNADPH64.5 ± 7.70.0041 ± 0.00030.064 ± 0.009ErythroseNADH80.1 ± 18.90.016 ± 0.0020.205 ± 0.059Ethanol (control)NAD5.7 ± 0.50.106 ± 0.00418.6 ± 1.8Fraction B, SORDErythroseNADPH340.3 ± 291.65 ± 0.114.84 ± 0.53ErythroseNADH266 ± 1200.13 ± 0.050.51 ± 0.29Sorbitol (control)NAD1.15 ± 0.160.26 ± 0.01230 ± 33 Open table in a new tab Table 2Identification of rabbit liver ADH1Accession numberProtein descriptionPercentage of protein sequence covered by identified peptidesNumber of distinct peptides in the protein groupTotal number of identified protein sequences, including those redundantly identifiedNumber of protein groups in which peptide is foundMolecular mass of peptideScore Sequest HT: Sequest HTkDaNP_001095174.1Alcohol dehydrogenase 19234574139.61808.66NP_001171758.1Alcohol dehydrogenase class-2 isozyme 2611644140.5125.73XP_008250935.2Predicted: low quality protein: 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, peroxisomal681835145.6104.83XP_008248783.1Predicted: 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase591635144.895.62XP_008267298.2Predicted: low quality protein: sorbitol dehydrogenase44930137.982.13XP_008261518.1Predicted: arginase-1 isoform X1581522137.474.05NP_001075740.1Phosphoserine aminotransferase441424140.658.6NP_001164585.1Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B41917139.651.23NP_001075778.1serine–pyruvate aminotransferase25811143.129.62XP_002719410.1Predicted: keratin, type I cytoskeletal 10 isoform X1744160.812.42XP_002711256.1Predicted: probable imidazolonepropionase1344146.510.31NP_001095187.1Serine hydroxymethyltransferase, cytosolic834152.97.92XP_002714459.1Predicted: glycine N-methyltransferase1122132.86.35XP_002719859.1Predicted: short-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, mitochondrial622144.35.55XP_002711597.1Predicted: aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial622147.45.47XP_008269673.1Predicted: keratin, type I cytoskeletal 15422149.94.68XP_017197922.1Predicted: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A isoform X1522145.23.25 Open table in a new tab Table 3Identification of rabbit liver SORD, fraction B1Accession numberProtein descriptionPercentage of protein sequence covered by identified peptidesNumber of distinct peptides in the protein groupTotal number of identified protein sequences, including those redundantly identifiedNumber of protein groups in which peptide is foundMolecular mass of peptideScore Sequest HT: Sequest HTkDaXP_008267298.2Predicted: low quality protein: sorbitol dehydrogenase8427496137.91589.24XP_002714459.1Predicted: glycine N-methyltransferase48841132.8124.26NP_001182607.1Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase30915136.544.71XP_002711050.1Predicted: keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1422163.66.51 Open table in a new tab Table 4Identification of rabbit liver SORD degradation product, fraction B2Accession numberProtein descriptionPercentage of protein sequence covered by identified peptidesNumber of distinct peptides in the protein groupTotal number of identified protein sequences, including those redundantly identifiedNumber of protein groups in which peptide is foundMolecular weight of peptideScore Sequest HT: Sequest HTkDaXP_002714459.1Predicted: glycine N-methyltransferase7825297132.81058.34XP_008267298.2Predicted: low quality protein: sorbitol dehydrogenase691942137.9126.08XP_002719410.1Predicted: keratin, type I cytoskeletal 10 isoform X1967160.819.41XP_002711050.1Predicted: keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1956163.614.37XP_008254715.1Predicted: keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1b748163.113.38XP_017197646.1Predicted: keratin, type II cytoskeletal 2 epidermal633164.29.32NP_001182607.1Trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase1133136.58.74XP_002711048.1Predicted: keratin, type II cytoskeletal 5 isoform X1422162.26.47 Open table in a new tab To determine whether human ADH1 and SORD catalyze erythrose reduction to erythritol, three common variants of human ADH1 and human SORD were cloned into pet28a(+) to make His6 fusions proteins, which were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. More specifically, the ADH1B1 and ADH1C2 cDNAs were directly cloned into pet28a(+). ADH1B2 results from a SNP of ADH1B1 (rs 1229984), which consists of a Gly to Ala transition that causes a single amino acid change (Arg to His). Site-directed mutagenesis of Arg-48 in ADH1B1 to His-48 was used to create the ADH1B2 protein (17Polimanti R. Gelernter J. ADH1B: from alcoholism, natural selection, and cancer to the human phenome.Am. J. Med. Genet. Part B Neuropsychiatr.

Human recombinant ADH1B1, ADH1C2, and SORD proteins all catalyze the NADPH-dependent conversion of d-erythrose to erythritol, although apparent Km values are about 5-fold higher for ADH1 variant proteins than for SORD in an enzymatic assay (Table 5, Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, the recombinant ADH1B2 protein was not active with respect to d-erythrose reduction activity with its physiological cofactor NADPH (Table 5, Fig. S2), although the recombinant protein was capable of catalyzing ethanol oxidation (ethanol Km = 1.5 mm), indicating that an active protein was purified. In addition, the human ADH1 variant proteins and SORD were capable of reducing d-erythrose to erythritol when NADH was used as a cofactor (Table 5, Fig. S3), but this reaction may only occur in enzymatic assays in vitro, as ADH1 and SORD are cytosolic enzymes (18Oates P.J. Polyol pathway and diabetic peripheral neuropathy.Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2002; 50 (12198816): 325-39210.1016/S0074-7742(02)50082-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crabb D.W. Matsumoto M. Chang D.

It is also worth noting that none of the ADH1 variants, or SORD exhibited erythrose reduction activity in vitro when the unnatural sugar isomer l-erythrose was used as a substrate, regardless of whether the cofactor was NADPH or NADH.Table 5Kinetic characterization of erythrose reduction activity of human recombinant ADH1 variant proteins and SORD in vitro using NADPH as the cofactorAlleleHighest prevalenceApparent Kmkcatkcat/KmSubstrate inhibitionmms−1m−1 s−1NADPH used as cofactorADH1B1Caucasian, African American322 ± 1680.9 ± 0.31.4 ± 1.2Ki = 335 ± 237 mmADH1B2AsianNo activity detectedNo activity detectedNo activity detectedNo activity detectedADH1C2Caucasian518 ± 1800.40 ± 0.070.9 ± 0.3NoneSORD118 ± 111.58 ± 0.0513.8 ± 1.4NoneNADH used as cofactorADH1B1Caucasian, African American272 ± 701.04 ± 0.193.8 ± 1.2Ki = 403 ± 127 mmADH1B2Asian228 ± 360.70 ± 0.053.1 ± 0.6NoneADH1C2Caucasian443 ± 781.60 ± 0.173.6 ± 0.7NoneSORD94 ± 24.10 ± 0.0343.1 ± 2.0None Open table in a new tab A computational modeling analysis of the ADH1 active site containing a zinc atom, d-erythrose, and NADPH reveals that the Arg-47 residue of ADH1B1 makes three contacts with NADPH (Fig. 4A), including two contacts with the phosphate moiety that distinguishes NADPH from NADH. It is important to note that the primary structure of ADH1B1 in the protein data bank file lacks the start methionine residue, so Arg-47 is equivalent to Arg-48 in the cDNA of the recombinant protein assayed. His-47 of ADH1B2 makes only one contact with NADPH (Fig. 4B), and no contacts with the distinguishing phosphate moiety, suggesting that the lack of activity observed in ADH1B2 with erythrose and NADPH is the result of impaired cofactor binding by ADH1B2. SORD and ADH1 are structurally and kinetically homologous (21El-Kabbani O. Darmanin C. Chung R. Sorbitol dehydrogenase: structure, function and ligand design.Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11 (14965227): 465-47610.2174/0929867043455927Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but the binding site for NADH or NADPH is more open in SORD; several of the NADH/NADPH-protein contacts found in ADH, including those involving residue 47, are replaced with NADH/NADPH solvent contacts (Fig. 4, A–C). However, there appears to be a specific contact made between the phosphate moiety of NADPH and SORD Arg-208 (Fig. 4C); in ADH the corresponding residue is Lys-228, which is present in all the forms studied and also contacts NADPH. To interrogate the role of the SORD Arg-208 residue, recombinant protein was expressed in which Arg-208 of SORD was mutated to histidine. The SORD R208H mutation did not affect the apparent Km for d-erythrose (118 ± 11 for the WT compared with 141 ± 26 mm for R208H, p > 0.05, Fig. S4) when NADPH was used as the cofactor, but did reduce kcat to less than 20% of WT levels (1.6 ± 0.1 compared with 0.23 ± 0.02 s−1 for R208H, p < 0.05, Fig. S4). These observations suggest that arginine contributes to NADPH binding in these enzymes (22Carugo O. Argos P. NADP-dependent enzymes: I, conserved stereochemistry of cofactor binding.Proteins. 1997; 28 (9144787): 10-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To confirm that the identified enzymes, ADH1 and SORD, contribute to endogenous erythritol formation in human cells, we performed silencing experiments using siRNA in A549 lung cancer cells and subsequently measured intracellular erythritol levels. Forty-eight hours after siRNA application to the cells, we determined the expression levels of the target genes by qPCR to verify knockdown (Fig. 5, a and b). This demonstrated that in A549 cells, ADH1B was not expressed at all (data not shown), whereas ADH1C was expressed at very low levels indicated by the consistently high CT values (CT > 34) (Fig. 5a). This is in line with the publicly available expression data reported by the Human Protein Atlas (www.proteinatlas.org) (43Uhlén M. Fagerberg L. Hallström B.M. Lindskog C. Oksvold P. Mardinoglu A.

As a result, A549 cells cannot be used to determine the role of ADH1B and ADH1C in erythritol synthesis and further studies in suitable culture models are required. SORD-targeting siRNA, however, significantly reduced SORD mRNA levels to less than 15% of control levels (p < 0.01, Fig. 5b). Intracellular erythritol levels were reduced by 50% as a result of SORD knockdown (p < 0.001, Fig. 5c). Moreover, based on the obtained mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) after labeling with [U-13C]glucose (Fig. 5d), the entire intracellular erythritol pool was labeled at all four carbon atoms (M4) suggesting that in A549 lung cancer cells, 100% of the intracellular erythritol is derived from glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2973061664,"Context Multiple factors contribute to sexual dysfunction in men with obesity. Sex hormone levels are commonly abnormal in men with obesity and this abnormality is often the focus of management in clinical practice. The role of small fibre neuropathy in obesity-related sexual dysfunction is not well established. Objective We aimed to investigate the relationship between sexual function, sex hormone levels and small nerve fibre morphology in men with severe obesity. Materials and methods A prospective study of 29 men with severe obesity was undertaken. Sexual function was assessed using the European Male Ageing Study Sexual Function Questionnaire. Small nerve fibre morphology was quantified using corneal confocal microscopy. Sex hormone levels were measured by mass spectrophotometry. Results Erectile dysfunction was present in 72% of the cohort with a higher prevalence of diabetes among the symptomatic group (88% vs 38%, p = 0.006). Corneal nerve fibre length (CNFL) and corneal nerve fibre density (CNFD) were both significantly lower in participants with erectile dysfunction compared to those without (p = 0.039 and p = 0.048 respectively). The erectile function score correlated with CNFL (r = -0.418, p = 0.034) and CNFD (r = -0.411, p = 0.037). Total testosterone and calculated free testosterone levels did not differ significantly between men with or without erectile dysfunction (median 8.8 nmol/L vs 9.0 nmol/L, p = 0.914; and median 176 pmol/L vs 179 pmol/L, p = 0.351 respectively), infrequent sexual thoughts (median 8.1 nmol/L vs 9.2 nmol/L, p = 0.650; and median 184 pmol/L, vs 176 pmol/L, p = 0.619 respectively) and decreased morning erections (median 9.0 nmol/L vs 8.8 nmol/L, p = 0.655; and median 170 pmol/L vs 193 pmol/L, p = 0.278 respectively). Conclusion Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in men with severe obesity. We found an association between small fibre neuropathy with erectile dysfunction with presence of diabetes a likely a significant contributing factor. We found no associations between testosterone levels with sexual symptoms (including frequency of sexual thoughts). The influence of small nerve fibre neuropathy on response to therapeutic interventions and whether interventions that improve small fibre neuropathy can improve erectile function in this population merits further study."

If needs are not sufficiently met and difficulties overcome, it may result in limited participation and decreased life satisfaction for this group. We aimed to understand life after stroke through the lens of participants' cameras, and hence their views and experiences guided this study.By the means of photovoice, an action research method, this study was conducted in a collaborative format with six women and five men after stroke. Participants photographed in everyday life for up to four weeks and then met to discuss all images in a focus group setting. Subsequently, participants gave feedback on the method and discussed the upcoming photography exhibition. All photos and the three focus group discussions were analyzed using a thematic analysis with an inductive approach.In the focus group discussions, life after stroke were conceptualized through five main themes: a driving force to participate in society; managing everyday life through inventiveness and persistent training; insufficient healthcare and rehabilitation in the long-term perspective; finding meaningful relationships and activities in daily life. Participants' voices are made clear through selected photos, which aim to present each theme and make results easier to understand.Participants found new ways to approach everyday life situations and had thereby regained a sense of control in life. However, it was evident that psychological processes towards adaptation were hindered by depression and that some individuals felt alone in an ongoing struggle. Additionally, available interventions a long time after stroke were not flexible enough to address all participants' needs."

In acute clinical settings however, the specific challenging symptoms and signs are more important than a diagnostic group. Thus, exploration of cytokines and immune activity and their role in specific symptoms is important. Reports in this field so far are sparse.In the present study, we aimed to examine the association between immune activity measured as levels of cytokines and agitation (independent of diagnostic group) in patients admitted to an acute psychiatric inpatient department.A total of 316 patients admitted to an acute psychiatric inpatient department were included. Thirty-nine patients with psychosis were subject to subgroup analyses. Agitation was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Excitement Component (PANSS-EC). Based on PANNS-EC patients were stratified into two groups: 67 agitated patients and 249 non-agitated patients. Serum concentrations of the following immune markers were measured: interleukin (IL) -1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, interferon (IFN) -γ and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β.Serum levels of TNF-α were significantly higher in patients with agitation compared to those without, both when all patients were included in the analyses (p = 0.004) and in the psychosis group (p = 0.027). After correcting for multiple testing, only the findings in the total population remained significant.Our findings suggest an association between TNF-α and agitation in an acute psychiatric population. A similar trend was reproduced to the psychosis subgroup. This suggests that agitation might be an independent entity associated with cytokines across different diagnostic groups."
https://openalex.org/W2972568824,"We propose a method for learning multi-agent policies to compete against multiple opponents. The method consists of recurrent neural network-based actor-critic networks and deterministic policy gradients that promote cooperation between agents by communication. The learning process does not require access to opponents’ parameters or observations because the agents are trained separately from the opponents. The actor networks enable the agents to communicate using forward and backward paths while the critic network helps to train the actors by delivering them gradient signals based on their contribution to the global reward. Moreover, to address nonstationarity due to the evolving of other agents, we propose approximate model learning using auxiliary prediction networks for modeling the state transitions, reward function, and opponent behavior. In the test phase, we use competitive multi-agent environments to demonstrate by comparison the usefulness and superiority of the proposed method in terms of learning efficiency and goal achievements. The comparison results show that the proposed method outperforms the alternatives."
https://openalex.org/W2972787070,"Presence of preoperative sarcopenia is a risk factor for postoperative complications. However, there are few reports on the presence of sarcopenia and its characteristics following gastrectomy. Sarcopenia is closely related to quality of life in elderly people. To date, the main purpose of follow-up after gastrectomy is surveillance for early detection of recurrence and secondary cancer. However, henceforth, quality of life in elderly gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy must also be evaluated. The present study aimed to investigate sarcopenia during a 1-year postoperative course in elderly gastric cancer patients and examine their characteristics. The subjects were 50 patients aged ≥70 years who underwent laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer and who experienced no recurrence 1 year postoperatively. Height, weight, serum albumin levels, food intake amount, grip strength, gait speed, visceral fat area, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index were measured preoperatively and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Sarcopenia, obesity, and visceral obesity were diagnosed. Compared with preoperatively, indicators other than height decreased 6 months postoperatively. Compared with 6 months postoperatively, body weight, amount of food intake, and visceral fat area increased by 1 year postoperatively, unlike appendicular skeletal muscle mass index. The frequency of sarcopenia increased 6 months postoperatively compared with preoperatively; this frequency remained almost unchanged 1 year postoperatively compared with 6 months postoperatively. Further, the frequency of visceral obesity increased 1 year postoperatively compared with 6 months postoperatively. Weight increased after > 6 months postoperatively; however, most of the weight increase was in terms of fat and not muscle. We emphasize the importance of considering postoperative sarcopenia and visceral obesity. In particular, sarcopenia and visceral obesity should be carefully monitored after increases in body mass index and food consumption."

https://openalex.org/W2973177207,"At higher latitudes, vertebrates exhibit a seasonal cycle of reproduction in response to changes in day-length, referred to as photoperiodism. Extended day-length induces thyroid-stimulating hormone in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland. This hormone triggers the local activation of thyroid hormone in the mediobasal hypothalamus and eventually induces gonadal development. In avian species, light information associated with day-length is detected through photoreceptors located in deep-brain regions. Within these regions, the expressions of multiple photoreceptive molecules, opsins, have been observed. However, even though the Japanese quail is an excellent model for photoperiodism because of its robust and significant seasonal responses in reproduction, a comprehensive understanding of photoreceptors in the quail brain remains undeveloped. In this study, we initially analyzed an action spectrum using photoperiodically induced expression of the beta subunit genes of thyroid-stimulating hormone in quail. Among seven wavelengths examined, we detected maximum sensitivity of the action spectrum at 500 nm. The low value for goodness of fit in the alignment with a template of retinal1-based photopigment, assuming a spectrum associated with a single opsin, proposed the possible involvement of multiple opsins rather than a single opsin. Analysis of gene expression in the septal region and hypothalamus, regions hypothesized to be photosensitive in quail, revealed mRNA expression of a mammal-like melanopsin in the infundibular nucleus within the mediobasal hypothalamus. However, no significant diurnal changes were observed for genes in the infundibular nucleus. Xenopus-like melanopsin, a further isoform of melanopsin in birds, was detected in neither the septal region nor the infundibular nucleus. These results suggest that the mammal-like melanopsin expressed in the infundibular nucleus within the mediobasal hypothalamus could be candidate deep-brain photoreceptive molecule in Japanese quail. Investigation of the functional involvement of mammal-like melanopsin-expressing cells in photoperiodism will be required for further conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2972537350,"Background Frailty is a major health issue which impacts the life of older people, posing a significant challenge to the health system. One of the key emerging areas is the development of frailty interventions to halt or reverse the progression of the condition. In many countries, economic evidence is required to inform public funding decisions for such interventions, and cost-effectiveness models are needed to estimate long-term costs and effects. Such models should capture current clinical understanding of frailty, its progression and its health consequences. The objective of this paper is to present a conceptual model of frailty that can be used to inform the development of a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate frailty interventions. Methods After critical analysis of the clinical and economic literature, a Delphi study consisting of experts from the disciplines of clinical medicine and epidemiology was undertaken to inform the key components of the conceptual model. We also identified relevant databases that can be used to populate and validate the model. Results A list of significant health states/events for which frailty is a strong independent risk factor was identified (e.g., hip fracture, hospital admission, delirium, death). We also identified a list of important patient attributes that may influence disease progression (e.g., age, gender, previous hospital admissions, depression). A number of large-scale relevant databases were also identified to populate and validate the cost-effectiveness model. Face validity of model structure was confirmed by experts. Discussion and conclusions The proposed conceptual model is being used as a basis for developing a new cost-effectiveness model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes associated with a range of frailty interventions. Using an appropriate model structure, which more accurately reflects the natural history of frailty, will improve model transparency and accuracy. This will ultimately lead to better informed public funding decisions around interventions to manage frailty."

The population doubling time and morphology of the iHCjECs were analyzed. The expressions of CK13, CK19, CK12, and MUC1, MUC4, MUC16, and MUC5AC were determined by real time PCR and immunohistochemically under different culture conditions. The organotypic culture model in which iHCjECs were cultured on rabbit conjunctival fibroblast-embedded collagen gel was used to characterize the iHCjECs.The iHCjECs cultured with doxycycline (Dox) continued to proliferate for at least 20 passages and had a cobblestone-like appearance. The expressions of CK13 and CK19 but not CK12 were detected in the iHCjECs, and the expression of CK13 increased in culture media lacking Dox (Dox-). The expressions of MUC1, MUC4, MUC16, and MUC5AC were detected in iHCjECs, and a relatively strong immunostaining of MUC5AC was detected with Dox(-) added 5% FBS. Stratified iHCjECs were observed in organotypic culture at 5 days.The iHCjECs had high proliferation rates and abilities to control the differentiation potency to control the expression of SV40 LT-antigen with Tet-regulated gene-expression system. They are able to express the mucin gene repertoire of their native epithelia. The iHCjECs can be a useful experimental cell line to study conjunctival epithelial cell characteristics and for pathophysiological and toxicological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2972573047,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the result of chronic injury where fibroblasts become activated and secrete large amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to impaired fibroblasts degradation followed by stiffness and loss of lung function. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an intermediate of glycolytic pathway, decreases PF development, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. To address this issue, PF was induced in vivo using a mouse model, and pulmonary fibroblasts were isolated from healthy and fibrotic animals. In PF model mice, lung function was improved by FBP as revealed by reduced collagen deposition and downregulation of ECM gene expression such as collagens and fibronectin. Fibrotic lung fibroblasts (FLF) treated with FBP for 3 days in vitro showed decreased proliferation, contraction, and migration, which are characteristic of myofibroblast to fibroblast phenotype reversal. ECM-related genes and proteins such as collagens, fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin, were also downregulated in FBP-treated FLF. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 1, responsible for ECM degradation, was produced only in fibroblasts obtained from healthy lungs (HLF) and FBP did not alter its expression. On the other hand, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, a MMP1 inhibitor, and MMP2, related to fibroblast tissue-invasion, were predominantly produced by FLF and FBP was able to downregulate its expression. These results demonstrate that FBP may prevent bleomycin-induced PF development through reduced expression of collagen and other ECM components mediated by a reduced TIMP-1 and MMP2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2972713876,"Introduction Precarious employment is associated with poor health. Among employees in precarious employment, those with multiple jobs may face additional health risks, e.g. due to combining work schedules and job roles. Our research question is: do differences in health exist between multiple and single job holders in precarious employment? Methods Participants in the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey 2012 aged 25–64 years who were not employed through the Act on Social Work Provision and who had a precarious job were included. To select employees in precarious employment (n = 3,609), latent class analysis was performed, based on variables based on indicators described by Van Aerden. Differences in general self-perceived health, burnout complaints, musculoskeletal health, and sickness absence between multiple and single job holders were studied cross-sectionally using logistic regression analyses. Results No significant differences were found between multiple and single job holders in precarious employment for self-perceived health (OR = 0.9; 95%CI = 0.7–1.3), burnout complaints (OR = 0.9; 95%CI = 0.7–1.2), and musculoskeletal health (OR = 1.1; 95%CI = 0.8–1.5). In crude analyses, multiple job holders experienced less sickness absence than single job holders (OR = 0.7; 95%CI = 0.5–0.9). In adjusted analyses, this difference was no longer statistically significant (OR = 0.8; 95%CI = 0.6–1.0). Conclusions Despite potential health risks related to multiple job holding, we did not find health differences between multiple and single job holders in precarious employment in the Netherlands. More longitudinal research is necessary to provide recommendations for policy makers regarding multiple job holders in precarious employment."

Forearm specimens containing skin and subcutaneous fat were obtained from 24 upper extremities of 12 adult cadavers. Cutaneous nerves were visualized using modified Sihler's staining. Then the data was used to show the distribution pattern and innervation area of the forearm cutaneous nerve. The anterior branch of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve innervates 26% of the medial anterior forearm; the posterior branch innervates 38.21% of the lateral anterior forearm and 24.46% of the lateral posterior forearm. The anterior branch of medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve innervates the medial aspect of the forearm covering 27.67% of the anterior region; the posterior branch the lateral part of the forearm covering 7.67% and 34.75% of the anterior and posterior regions, respectively. The posterior antebrachial cutaneous nerve covers 41.04% of the posterior forearm. Coaptations were found between the branches of these cutaneous nerves. The relatively dense secondary nerve branches were found in the middle 1/3 of the lateral anterior forearm and the middle 1/3 of the medial posterior forearm. The relatively dense tertiary nerve branches were the middle 1/3 and lower 1/3 of the medial anterior forearm. The intradermal nerve branches were the relatively dense in the middle 1/3 of the medial anterior and lateral posterior forearm. The middle 1/3 of the medial and lateral forearm had the relatively dense total nerve branches. These results can be used sensory matching while designing forearm flaps for reconstruction surgeries to obtain improved recovery of sensory."
https://openalex.org/W2972901860,"Background To explore the perception of home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) by general practitioners (GPs) in everyday practice in order to identify facilitators and barriers to its implementation in daily practice. Methods A qualitative study comprising the conduct of six focus groups between October 2016 and February 2017, gathering 41 general practitioners in primary care practice in Lorraine (North Eastern France), with thematic and comprehensive analysis. Results The first reasons given by GPs to explain their difficulties with HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) implementation were the usual lack of time, material and human resources. However, all of these motives masked other substantial limiting factors including insufficient knowledge regarding HBPM, poor adherence to recommendations on HBPM and fear of losing their medical authority. GPs admitted that HBPM use could enhance patient observance and decrease therapeutic inertia. Despite this observation, most GPs used HBPM only at the time of diagnosis and rarely for follow-up. One explanation for GP reluctance towards HBPM may be, along with guidelines regarding hypertension, HBPM is perceived as being a binding framework and being difficult to implement. This barrier was more predominantly observed among aging GPs than in young GPs and was less frequent when GPs practiced in multidisciplinary health centers because the logistical barrier was no longer present. Discussion In order to improve HBPM implementation in everyday practice in France, it is necessary to focus on GP training and patient education. We must also end ""medical power"" in hypertension management and turn to multidisciplinary care including nurses, pharmacists and patients."

https://openalex.org/W2973027614,"Population dynamics studies and harvesting strategies often take advantage of body size measurements. Selected elements of the skeletal system such as mandibles, are often used as retrospective indices to describe body size. The variation in mandibular measurements reflects the variation in the ecological context and hence the variation in animal performance. We investigated the length of the anterior and posterior sections of the mandible in relation to the conditions experienced by juveniles of 8-10 months of age during prenatal and early postnatal life and we evaluated these parameters as ecological indicators of juvenile condition as well as female reproductive condition in a roe deer population living in the southern part of the species range. We analyzed a sample of over 24,000 mandibles of roe deer shot in 22 hunting districts in the Arezzo province (Tuscany, Central Italy) from 2005 to 2015 per age class. Mandible total length in juveniles is equal to 90% of total length in adults. In this stage of life the growing of the mandible's anterior section is already completed while that of the posterior section is still ongoing. Environmental conditions conveyed by forest productivity, agricultural land use, local population density and climate strongly affected the growth of the anterior and posterior sections of the mandibles. Conditions experienced both by pregnant females and offspring played an important role in shaping the length of the anterior section, while the size of the posterior section was found to be related to the conditions experienced by offspring. Temporal changes of the length of the anterior section are a particularly suitable index of growth constraints. Anterior section length in fact differs according to more or less advantageous conditions recorded not only in the year of birth, but also in the previous year. Similarly, the sexual size dimorphism of the anterior section of the roe deer mandible can be used to describe the quality of females above two years of age, as well as habitat value. Hence the anterior section length of the mandible and its sexual size dimorphism are indexes that can provide cues of population performance, because they capture the system's complexities, while remain simple enough to be easily and routinely used in the majority of European countries where roe deer hunting period extends from early autumn to late spring."
https://openalex.org/W2972517546,"Methanobactins (Mbns) are ribosomally-produced, post-translationally modified peptidic copper-binding natural products produced under conditions of copper limitation. Genes encoding Mbn biosynthetic and transport proteins have been identified in a wide variety of bacteria, indicating a broader role for Mbns in bacterial metal homeostasis. Many of the genes in the Mbn operons have been assigned functions, but two genes usually present, mbnP and mbnH, encode uncharacterized proteins predicted to reside in the periplasm. MbnH belongs to the bacterial diheme cytochrome c peroxidase (bCcP)/MauG protein family, and MbnP contains no domains of known function. Here, we performed a detailed bioinformatic analysis of both proteins and have biochemically characterized MbnH from Methylosinus (Ms.) trichosporium OB3b. We note that the mbnH and mbnP genes typically co-occur and are located proximal to genes associated with microbial copper homeostasis. Our bioinformatics analysis also revealed that the bCcP/MauG family is significantly more diverse than originally appreciated, and that MbnH is most closely related to the MauG subfamily. A 2.6 Å resolution structure of Ms. trichosporium OB3b MbnH combined with spectroscopic data and peroxidase activity assays provided evidence that MbnH indeed more closely resembles MauG than bCcPs, although its redox properties are significantly different from those of MauG. The overall similarity of MbnH to MauG suggests that MbnH could post-translationally modify a macromolecule, such as internalized CuMbn or its uncharacterized partner protein, MbnP. Our results indicate that MbnH is a MauG-like diheme protein that is likely involved in microbial copper homeostasis and represents a new family within the bCcP/MauG superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2973008776,"Growth hormone (GH) is an important hormone released by the pituitary gland that plays a key role in the growth and development of organisms. In our study, TargetScan analysis and the dual luciferase reporter assays were used to predict and screen for miRNAs that might act on the rat Gh1 gene, and we identified miR-543-5p. Then, the GH3 cell line and the primary rat pituitary cells were transfected with miRNA mimic, inhibitor, and siRNA. We detected the Gh1 gene expression and the GH secretion by real-time PCR and ELISAs, respectively, to verify the regulatory effect of miR-543-5p on GH secretion. The results showed that miR-543-5p can inhibit Gh1 mRNA expression and reduce GH secretion. MiR-543-5p inhibitor upregulated Gh1 mRNA expression and increased GH secretion compared with the negative control. In summary, miR-543-5p downregulates Gh1 expression, resulting in a decrease in GH synthesis and secretion, which demonstrates the important role of miRNAs in regulating GH and animal growth and development."

Agent Based Modeling is emerging as a powerful modeling tool for design, analysis and control of such logistics systems. However, the complexity of the model itself can be overwhelming and mathematical meta-modeling tools are needed that aggregate information and enable fast and accurate decision making and control system design. Here we present Koopman Mode Analysis (KMA) as such a tool. KMA uncovers exponentially growing, decaying or oscillating collective patterns in dynamical data. We apply the methodology to two problems, both of which exhibit a bifurcation in dynamical behavior, but feature very different dynamics: Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) logistics and ship fueling (SF) logistics. The MTF problem features a transition between efficient operation at low casualty rates and inefficient operation beyond a critical casualty rate, while the SF problem features a transition between short mission life at low initial fuel levels and sustained mission beyond a critical initial fuel level. Both bifurcations are detected by analyzing the spectrum of the associated Koopman operator. Mathematical analysis is provided justifying the use of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithm in punctuated linear decay dynamics that is featured in the SF problem."

Patients were allocated, according to the occurrence of menopause and body mass index (BMI), into four groups: PM0 (premenopausal non-obese), PM1 (premenopausal obese), M0 (postmenopausal non-obese), and M1 (postmenopausal obese). Serum levels of gonadotropins, sex hormones, lipid markers, leptin, hs-CRP and interleukin-6 were obtained using either colorimetric or immunoenzymatic assays. Univariate and correlation analyses were performed among all clinical and laboratorial parameters. Principal component analysis was used to characterize subsets of biomarkers, which had their discriminatory capacity tested using discriminant function analysis.Levels of gonadotropins and female sex hormones were similar between PM0 and PM1 and between M0 and M1 (p > 0.05), all of them varied between PM0 and M0 (p < 0.05), but only estradiol was significantly altered in the comparison between PM1 and M1 (p = 0.027). Regarding metabolic markers, leptin was lower in PM0 than in M0 (p = 0.010) and higher in M1 than in M0 (p = 0.046). In premenopausal women, BMI correlated only to leptin, while it correlated to several other markers in postmenopausal women. A combination of FSH and leptin serum levels significantly discriminated the four groups (Wilks's lambda < 0.001, in canonical functions 1 and 2).A combined analysis of hormonal biomarkers may potentially distinguish obese from non-obese women with distinct menopause status. Further research is thus required to clarify the clinical significance of such findings."

By using immunohistochemistry, cerebellar cortical neurons and zone and stripes pattern were studied in Pap-/- ;Snca-/- mouse cerebellum. We show that the Pap-/- ;Snca-/- cerebellar cortex development appears to be normal. Compartmentation genes expression such as zebrin II, HSP25, and P75NTR show the zone and stripe phenotype characteristic of the normal cerebellum. These data indicate that although aggregation of PAP and SNCA causes severe neurodegenerative diseases, PAP -/- with absence of the Snca does not appear to interrupt the cerebellar architecture development and zone and stripe pattern formation.

We believe that for CGM to be effective, it should also incorporate other relevant socio-cultural constructs. To contribute to the further development of CGM to ensure that it reflects the local context, we report on the cultural conceptualization of healthy child growth in rural Tanzania. Specifically, we examine how caregivers describe and recognize healthy growth in young children, and the meanings they attach to these cultural markers of healthy growth.Caregivers of under-five children, including mothers, fathers, elderly women, and community health workers, were recruited from a rural community in Kilosa District, Southeastern Tanzania. Using an ethnographic approach and the cultural schemas theory, data for the study were collected through 19 focus group discussions, 30 in-depth interviews, and five key informant interviews. Both inductive and deductive approaches were used in the data analysis.Participants reported using multiple markers for ascertaining healthy growth. These include 'being bonge' (chubby), 'being free of illness', 'eating well', 'growing in height', as well as 'having good kilos' (weight). Despite the integration of some biomedical concepts into the local conceptualization of growth, the meanings attached to these concepts are largely rooted in the participants' cultural framework. For instance, a child's weight is ascribed to the parents' adherence to postpartum sex taboos and to the nature of a child's bones. The study noted conceptual differences between the meanings attached to height from a biomedical and a local perspective. Whereas from a biomedical perspective the height increment is considered an outcome of growth, the participants did not see height as linked to nutrition, and did not believe that they have control over their child's height.To provide context-sensitive advice to mothers during CGM appointments, health workers should use a tool that takes into account the mothers' constructs derived from their cultural framework of healthy growth. The use of this approach should facilitate communication between health professionals and caregivers during CGM activities, increase the uptake and utilization of CGM services, and, eventually, contribute to reduced levels of childhood malnutrition in the community."

This paper abandons the assumption of a scale economy and separates the changes of benefits brought about by the scale from scientific and technological progress, thus changing the C-D production function from linear to nonlinear. Based on a feedforward neural network, it calculates the coefficient of the output elasticity, the economic contribution rate of China's hydraulic science and technology and the scale economies for each year using relevant data from 1981 to 2016. The results show that (1) the average contribution rate of capital investment from 1981 to 2016 was 47.3%, and the average contribution rate of labor from 1981 to 2016 was 9.1%. It is not obvious that the significant increase in the labor force has contributed to the growth of China's water conservancy industry. (2) The average contribution rate of scale economies in 1981-2016 was 26.7%, and the contribution rate of scale economies is negatively correlated with the capital contribution rate. (3) The average contribution rate of China's hydraulic science and technology was 43.6% from 1981 to 2016, and the average contribution rate of the total factor productivity after removing scale economies from 1981 to 2016 was 16.9%. During the period of the 6th Five-Year Plan(1981~1985), the contribution rate of water conservancy science and technology was relatively high. Since that time, it has remained at 40%. In recent years, as water conservancy reforms in key areas have made positive progress, scientific and technological progress has increased the growth of water conservancy benefits annually."
https://openalex.org/W2972851215,"Aim This study aimed to develop a “family caregiver needs-assessment scale for end-of-life care for senility at home” (FADE) and examine its reliability and validity. Method A draft item pool was developed based on a literature review, and simplified to 30 items in four domains. Next, the item pool was reviewed by four visiting nurses and four researchers and refined to 15 items. A cross-sectional study was then conducted using a self-reported questionnaire. Questionnaires were sent to 2703 visiting nurses. The survey questions included participants’ basic demographic information, the importance of each item according to a modified scale, basic demographics for cases of death by senility at home, satisfaction with each item of the modified scale in an example case, and assessment of the case using the Japanese version of the Support Team Assessment Schedule (STAS-J). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. Construct validity was confirmed using confirmatory factor analysis, and correlation between the new scale and the STAS-J was used to assess criterion-related validity. Results In total, 461 visiting nurses provided valid responses. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified 12 items from two factors: “Needs for adaptation to senility bereavement” and “Needs for essential skills in supporting a dignified death by senility.” The final model showed appropriate index values: standardized root mean residual = 0.057, Tucker–Lewis index = 0.920, Akaike information criterion = 191.6, and Bayesian information criterion = 298.2. Cronbach’s alpha for the entire scale was 0.908, and was above 0.840 for each factor. The correlation coefficient between STAS-J and the entire scale was 0.259–0.427 (p<0.001). Conclusions The FADE scale showed acceptable internal consistency and concurrent validity. The scale can help clarify issues and desires that present themselves at home related to adaptation to senility bereavement and essential skills in supporting a dignified death by senility. Addressing these issues and desires is expected to reduce caregivers’ anxiety and burden, and means the older adults under their care may be respected and enabled to live with dignity and peace."
