https://openalex.org/W2110374888,"The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions typically characterized by repetitive behaviour, severely restricted interests and difficulties with social interactions and communication. ASDs are highly heritable, yet the underlying genetic determinants remain largely unknown. A genome-wide analysis reveals that people with ASDs carry a higher load of rare copy-number variants — segments of DNA for which the copy number differs between individual genomes — which are either inherited or arise de novo. The results implicate several novel genes as ASD candidates and point to the importance of cellular proliferation, projection and motility as well as specific signalling pathways in this disorder. The autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) are highly heritable, yet the underlying genetic determinants remain largely unknown. Here, a genome-wide analysis of rare copy number variants (CNVs) has been carried out, revealing that ASD sufferers carry a higher load of rare, genic CNVs than do controls. Many of these CNVs are de novo and inherited. The results implicate several novel genes in ASDs, and point to the importance of cellular proliferation, projection and motility, as well as specific signalling pathways, in these disorders. The autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction and communication, and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours1. Individuals with an ASD vary greatly in cognitive development, which can range from above average to intellectual disability2. Although ASDs are known to be highly heritable (∼90%)3, the underlying genetic determinants are still largely unknown. Here we analysed the genome-wide characteristics of rare (<1% frequency) copy number variation in ASD using dense genotyping arrays. When comparing 996 ASD individuals of European ancestry to 1,287 matched controls, cases were found to carry a higher global burden of rare, genic copy number variants (CNVs) (1.19 fold, P = 0.012), especially so for loci previously implicated in either ASD and/or intellectual disability (1.69 fold, P = 3.4 × 10-4). Among the CNVs there were numerous de novo and inherited events, sometimes in combination in a given family, implicating many novel ASD genes such as SHANK2, SYNGAP1, DLGAP2 and the X-linked DDX53–PTCHD1 locus. We also discovered an enrichment of CNVs disrupting functional gene sets involved in cellular proliferation, projection and motility, and GTPase/Ras signalling. Our results reveal many new genetic and functional targets in ASD that may lead to final connected pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2119000420,"An optimal search theory, the so-called Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, predicts that predators should adopt search strategies known as Lévy flights where prey is sparse and distributed unpredictably, but that Brownian movement is sufficiently efficient for locating abundant prey. Empirical studies have generated controversy because the accuracy of statistical methods that have been used to identify Lévy behaviour has recently been questioned. Consequently, whether foragers exhibit Lévy flights in the wild remains unclear. Crucially, moreover, it has not been tested whether observed movement patterns across natural landscapes having different expected resource distributions conform to the theory's central predictions. Here we use maximum-likelihood methods to test for Lévy patterns in relation to environmental gradients in the largest animal movement data set assembled for this purpose. Strong support was found for Lévy search patterns across 14 species of open-ocean predatory fish (sharks, tuna, billfish and ocean sunfish), with some individuals switching between Lévy and Brownian movement as they traversed different habitat types. We tested the spatial occurrence of these two principal patterns and found Lévy behaviour to be associated with less productive waters (sparser prey) and Brownian movements to be associated with productive shelf or convergence-front habitats (abundant prey). These results are consistent with the Lévy-flight foraging hypothesis, supporting the contention that organism search strategies naturally evolved in such a way that they exploit optimal Lévy patterns."

https://openalex.org/W2015198542,"CXCR7 is a receptor for chemokines including CXCL12 (stromal-derived factor-1), a molecule that promotes tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer and other malignancies. Building on the recent observation that CXCR7 sequesters CXCL12, we investigated mechanisms for CXCR7-dependent uptake of chemokines. Breast cancer cells expressing CXCR7 accumulated chemokines CXCL12 and CXC11 present at concentrations <1 ng/ml, unlike cells expressing CXCR4. CXCR7-dependent accumulation of chemokines was reduced by inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After CXCR7-mediated internalization, CXCL12 trafficked to lysosomes and was degraded, although levels of CXCR7 remained stable. CXCR7 reduced CXCL12 in the extracellular space, limiting the amounts of chemokine available to acutely stimulate signaling through CXCR4. CXCR7 constitutively internalized and recycled to the cell membrane even in the absence of ligand, and addition of chemokines did not significantly enhance receptor internalization. Chemokines at concentrations less than the Kd values for ligand-receptor binding did not alter levels of CXCR7 at the cell surface. Higher concentrations of chemokine ligands reduced the total cell surface expression of CXCR7 without affecting receptor internalization, indicating that receptor recycling was inhibited. CXCR7-dependent uptake of chemokines and receptor trafficking were regulated by beta-arrestin 2. These studies establish mechanisms through which CXCR7 regulates the availability of chemokine ligands in the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W2135666474,"microRNA-205 (miR-205) and miR-184 coordinately regulate the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 for Akt survival signaling in keratinocytes. As the PI3K-Akt pathway has also been implicated in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cell motility, we investigated the role that these 2 miRNAs play in keratinocyte migration. We used antagomirs (antago) to reduce the levels of miR-205 and miR-184 in primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs) and corneal epithelial keratinocytes (HCEKs) as well as direct SHIP2 silencing using siRNA oligos. Treatment of HEKs and HCEKs with antago-205 increased SHIP2 levels and impaired the ability of these cells to seal linear scratch wounds compared with untreated or irrelevant-antago treatments. In contrast, AKT signaling was enhanced and wounds sealed faster in HCEKs where miR-184 was suppressed, enabling miR-205 to inhibit SHIP2. Similar increases in migration were observed following direct SHIP2 silencing in HEKs. Furthermore, down-regulation of miR-205 resulted in an increase in Rho-ROCKI activity, phosphorylation of the actin severing protein cofilin, and a corresponding diminution of filamentous actin. The connection among miR-205, RhoA-ROCKI-cofilin inactivation, and the actin cytoskeleton represents a novel post-translational mechanism for the regulation of normal human keratinocyte migration."
https://openalex.org/W2074798171,"The human enzyme paraoxonase-2 (PON2) has two functions, an enzymatic lactonase activity and the reduction of intracellular oxidative stress. As a lactonase, it dominantly hydrolyzes bacterial signaling molecule 3OC12 and may contribute to the defense against pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa. By its anti-oxidative effect, PON2 reduces cellular oxidative damage and influences redox signaling, which promotes cell survival. This may be appreciated but also deleterious given that high PON2 levels reduce atherosclerosis but may stabilize tumor cells. Here we addressed the unknown mechanisms and linkage of PON2 enzymatic and anti-oxidative function. We demonstrate that PON2 indirectly but specifically reduced superoxide release from the inner mitochondrial membrane, irrespective whether resulting from complex I or complex III of the electron transport chain. PON2 left O2·· dismutase activities and cytochrome c expression unaltered, and it did not oxidize O2·· but rather prevented its formation, which implies that PON2 acts by modulating quinones. To analyze linkage to hydrolytic activity, we introduced several point mutations and show that residues His114 and His133 are essential for PON2 activity. Further, we mapped its glycosylation sites and provide evidence that glycosylation, but not a native polymorphism Ser/Cys311, was critical to its activity. Importantly, none of these mutations altered the anti-oxidative/anti-apoptotic function of PON2, demonstrating unrelated activities of the same protein. Collectively, our study provides detailed mechanistic insight into the functions of PON2, which is important for its role in innate immunity, atherosclerosis, and cancer.

Either spontaneously or by enzymatic dismutase reaction, O2·· reacts to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which itself may be detoxified to water or further react to the hydroxyl radical. ROS, and also reactive nitrogen species (e.g. peroxynitrite; ONOO−), differ in characteristics such as stability, membrane permeability, or reactivity. Enhanced ROS levels, a result of augmented production or insufficient removal, modify diverse signaling pathways and are associated with various disorders such as cardiovascular diseases (1Madamanchi N.R. Vendrov A. Runge M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or cancer (2Landriscina M. Maddalena F. Laudiero G. Esposito F. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 2701-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consequently, many strategies aim at reducing ROS back to physiological levels, and mitochondria are centrally involved because of their high potential in ROS production (3Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 624-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes are surrounded by anti-oxidative factors to suppress coincidental O2·· generation by transfer of electrons to oxygen. However, O2·· also serves an intended starting point for apoptotic signaling because O2·· produced at the inner mitochondrial membrane is oxidized to H2O2, which gives rise to cardiolipin peroxidation, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and cell death (4Kagan V.E. Bayir H.A. Belikova N.A. Kapralov O. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Jiang J. Stoyanovsky D.A. Wipf P. Kochanek P.M. Greenberger J.S. Pitt B. Shvedova A.A. Borisenko G. Free Radic. Biol.

Thus, alterations of these processes are two-edged and can lead to either prolonged survival or death, for which reason they are modified in several diseases (e.g. tumors) and targeted by pharmacological interventions. Interestingly, the human enzyme paraoxonase-2 (PON2) may serve a putative target gene, because it protects against atherosclerosis (7Aviram M. Rosenblat M. Free Radic Biol.

The PONs differ in localization as PON1 mainly associates with circulating serum high density lipoprotein particles, whereas the intracellular PON2 appears in two spliced isoforms that predominantly localize to the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and (peri)-nuclear region (7Aviram M.

Endogenous substrates of PON2 are largely unknown, but it has been shown that its lactonase activity dominantly hydrolyzes the Pseudomonas aeruginosa signaling lactone 3OC12, for which reason PON2 may add to the anti-bacterial defense (16Teiber J.F.

Further, studies with PON2-deficient mice indicated that PON2 suppresses atherosclerosis, and several studies described a significant ROS-diminishing function of PON2 in various cells (8Ng C.J.

Although fundamental to understanding PON2 function, it is yet unanswered whether the lactonase activity and anti-oxidative function are interrelated. Also, the mechanism and specificity of its anti-oxidative function are unresolved. These issues were addressed in the current study. We found that PON2 specifically diminished O2·· released by both mitochondrial complex I and complex III at the inner mitochondrial membrane, presumably by acting on coenzyme Q10 (CoQ). In support, PON2 differs from superoxide dismutases (SODs) or vitamins in that it efficiently prevented O2·· formation but did not diminish O2·· resulting from CoQ-independent sources. We further demonstrate independent functions of PON2 because mutants devoid of lactonase activity still exhibited full protection against ROS and apoptosis. Together with results indicating that PON2 shares the same hydrolytic mechanism as PON1, we reveal fundamental details of the function and mechanism of PON2. All experiments employed human endothelial EA.hy 926 cells with or without stable PON2-GFP expression (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 19Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Altenhöfer S. Krüger M. Li H. Förstermann U. Biochem.

Dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR123) and MitoSox Red were from Molecular Probes; 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (DMNQ) and 3-morpholinosydnonimine (Sin-1) were from Calbiochem; L-012 was from Wako Chemicals; glycosidase-F was from Roche Applied Science; and 2-methyl-6-[p-methoxyphenyl]-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-a]-pyrazin-3-one (MCLA) and all other reagents were from Sigma. We used the QuikChange or Finnzymes site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene/New England Biolabs, respectively) according to the supplier's instructions with primers given in the supplemental material. Sequenced plasmids were transfected as before (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Protein expression was verified by Western blotting; PON2 mutant-GFP cDNAs were resequenced. Mitochondria were enriched according to standard procedures (see supplemental material). Membranes of fresh mitochondria were prepared by brief sonication and recentrifugation. Unless stated otherwise, ROS was detected as previously published (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Horke S. Witte I. Altenhöfer S. Wilgenbus P. Goldeck M. Förstermann U. Xiao J. Kramer G.L.

Where indicated, cells were pretreated with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coupled SOD (100 units/ml) or PEG-catalase (200 units/ml) for 24 h. Sin-1 (10 μm)-induced ONOO− was detected by dihydrorhodamine (DHR123) (5 μm). H2O2 was detected using the Fluoro Catalase kit (Cell Technology Inc.). To this end, cells were lysed in lysis buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, HALT protease inhibitor (Pierce)), and 20 μg of protein were analyzed. H2O2 was either added directly (40 μm) or produced indirectly via O2·· by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO; 200 μm/5 milliunits). Similarly, ROS were measured in the presence of recombinant human PON2 (rhPON2; Genway) or bovine serum albumin. Alternatively, PON2-His6 expressed in HEK293 cells was enriched by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (see supplemental material). Fractions containing PON2-His6 were used with 2.5 μg of protein/reaction or equal volumes of dialyzed eluates from mock-treated cells. Chemiluminescence was recorded before and after injection of xanthine (200 μm) to phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mm CaCl2, recombinant human PON2 or PON2-His6, 40 μm L-012, and xanthine oxidase (5 milliunits/ml). Also, O2·· was measured by quantification of 2-hydroxyethidium by HPLC (modified from Ref. 22Zhao H. Joseph J. Fales H.M. Sokoloski E.A. Levine R.L. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5727-5732Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) (see supplemental material). To detect mitochondrial O2··, samples were incubated with MitoSOX-Red (Mito-HE; 1 μm; 37 °C; 20 min) in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (+Ca; +Mg), washed, stimulated with antimycin (15 μm), and analyzed in a plate reader with excitation/emission at 405/580 nm, respectively. Alternatively, cells were loaded as before, stimulated (2 h) with antimycin (15 μm) or rotenone (20 μm), detached, washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences; at 405/580 nm). Mitochondria or membranes (0.25 μg protein/μl) were analyzed in 125 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm K2HPO4, 5 milliunits of xanthine oxidase, 5 μm MCLA; a luminometer recorded cumulative ROS production for 20 s before and after injection of xanthine (200 mm). Alternatively, superoxide was induced with antimycin (15 μm), succinate (5 mm), or α-ketoglutarate (5 mm). Zymography was used according to standard procedures (see supplemental material). Deglycosylation and determination of PON2 lactonase activity were previously published (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Horke S. Witte I. Altenhöfer S. Wilgenbus P. Goldeck M. Förstermann U. Xiao J. Kramer G.L. Haines D.C. Chowdhary P.K. Haley R.W. Teiber J.F. Biochem. J. 2010; 426: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, in every experiment, PON2 mutant expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting using a ChemiDoc XRS imaging system (Bio-Rad) equipped with QuantityOne 4.6.7 software, normalized to α-tubulin, and subsumed comparing levels with PON2-WT. GraphPad Prism 5 was used for calculation or statistical evaluation using one- or two-way analysis of variance and/or non-linear regression curve fitting. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Adobe Photoshop was used for image acquisition. If necessary, only brightness and/or contrast were changed simultaneously for all areas of any blot. We previously showed that PON2 reduced DMNQ-generated ROS detected with carboxyl-H2DCFDA or the luminol derivative L-012 (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but these analyses were unable to deduce the particular radical diminished by PON2. Because pretreatment with cell-permeable PEG-SOD but not PEG-catalase (to diminish O2·· or H2O2, respectively) significantly lowered ROS levels in such analyses (Fig. 1A), we concluded that PON2 diminished superoxide. To test this more directly, we used dihydroethidium, which under oxidative stress is oxidized to O2··-specific 2-hydroxyethidium and unspecific ethidium. After cells were loaded with dihydroethidium and treated with DMNQ, significantly increased 2-hydroxyethidium levels were found in naive, but not PON2-overexpressing, cells (Fig. 1B), which verifies the above conclusion. PON2 appears specific for O2·· because it did not alter levels of other radicals, namely H2O2 and ONOO− (Fig. 1, C and D). To test for direct protein actions, O2·· was generated in vitro by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (X/XO) in the presence of recombinant or mammalian PON2, but these PON2 preparations were indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 1E). This implies an indirect mechanism of PON2 and the necessity of a co-factor, or given the lack of redox-active centers, PON2 itself could serve as a co-factor for other systems. However, the chief O2··-diminishing activities of SOD1 and SOD2 were not changed by PON2 overexpression (Fig. 1F and see below). PON2 prevents generation of O2·· at the inner mitochondrial membrane, yet it is unknown whether the function of PON2 is restricted to certain organelles and also whether PON2 scavenges O2·· or prevents O2·· formation, which critically determines the function of the protein. Mitochondria are dominant O2·· sources, and we found that anti-oxidative effects of PON2 at mitochondria were vital to its anti-apoptotic role.4 When PON2-overexpressing cells, or mitochondria isolated thereof, were loaded with Mito-HE and stimulated with complex III inhibitor antimycin, we observed significantly less O2·· than in naive samples (Fig. 2A);4 thus, PON2 diminishes O2·· produced by complex III. Because complex III releases O2·· to both sides of the inner membrane (23Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5394) Google Scholar, 24Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), we next addressed the topology of PON2 function. Intriguingly, PON2 also diminished rotenone-stimulated O2·· produced by complex I (Fig. 2A), which releases O2·· only to the matrix side (23Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5394) Google Scholar). This implies that PON2 acts on the matrix side of the inner membrane or that it modulates CoQ, which shuttles electrons between the respiratory complexes. In support of the latter, mitochondrial membranes from PON2-overexpressing cells also produced less O2·· when stimulated with succinate, which is oxidized by complex II passing electrons to CoQ (Fig. 2B). Here MCLA was used for O2·· detection to control for putative adverse effects of Mito-HE. Under such conditions, PON2 diminished antimycin-induced O2·· as before (not shown). Suppression of O2·· from different sources argues against an association with individual complexes. Likewise, in our hands, complex III or cytochrome c immunoprecipitations did not co-precipitate PON2 and vice versa (whereas PON2 immunoprecipitations precipitated other PON2-interacting proteins; not shown). This implies that PON2 modulates the common denominator in electron transport and O2·· generation, namely CoQ. If true, our hypothesis presumed that PON2 inhibits the generation of O2·· but could not diminish this radical once it is produced. This was tested with CoQ-independent ROS sources. We stimulated mitochondrial membranes from naive or PON2-overexpressing cells with α-ketoglutarate, which produces ROS from membrane-associated but CoQ-independent α-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase (25Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 7771-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Under such conditions, similar O2·· levels were observed (Fig. 2C). Likewise, when O2·· was generated by X/XO, mitochondrial membranes from PON2-overexpressing cells were indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 2D), in contrast to stimulation with succinate, rotenone, or antimycin (see above). Thus, PON2 suppresses O2·· formation that involves CoQ, but it cannot scavenge O2·· once it is formed. Further controls support this conclusion. First, cytochrome c can oxidize O2·· to oxygen (26Pereverzev M.O. Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. Skulachev V.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1312-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but its expression was unchanged by PON2 (Fig. 2E), and cytochrome c siRNA did not abrogate the effect of PON2, albeit cytochrome c levels were reduced to ∼60% (not shown). Second, PON2 did not increase O2·· dismutation because lysates from naive or PON2-overexpressing cells had similar H2O2 levels secondary to X/XO-generated O2·· (Fig. 2F). To test whether ROS reduction is linked to enzymatic activity, we identified residues crucial to hydrolytic activity. PON2 shares ∼60% identity with PON1. For PON1, key catalytic residues are known, and its hydrolytic activity, but not glycosylation, is essential to its anti-atherogenic properties (11Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 27Aharoni A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We created point mutations in PON2 that correspond to the PON1 residues required for hydrolytic activity. Confocal microscopy of the GFP-tagged proteins revealed subcellular targeting identical to PON2-WT (not shown). To map the glycosylation site of PON2, glycosidase treatment with subsequent Western blotting was applied to lysates from cells overexpressing PON2-WT, -N254A, -N269A, -N323A, or -N254A/N323A (Fig. 3A). The mass of PON2-N269A was similar to the WT; thus, Asn269 is not glycosylated. In contrast, PON2-N254A or -N323A migrated between glycosylated and deglycosylated PON2-WT, and double mutant N254A/N323A was identical to deglycosylated PON2-WT. Thus, PON2 is glycosylated on both Asn254 and Asn323, which is consistent with Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To analyze PON2 activity, we used one of its putative natural substrates, 3OC12 (12Draganov D.I.

J. 2010; 426: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), under conditions that estimate initial hydrolytic rates. For all experiments, activities were normalized to expression levels (see “Experimental Procedures”) to exclude that differences result from dissimilar expression. Our previous studies showed that 3OC12 activity is specific for PON2 in EA.hy 926 cells (16Teiber J.F. Horke S. Haines D.C. Chowdhary P.K. Xiao J. Kramer G.L. Haley R.W. Draganov D.I. Infect.

Haley R.W. Teiber J.F. Biochem. J. 2010; 426: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although PON2-WT overexpression increased 3OC12 hydrolysis ∼2.3-fold, this was blunted by single mutations H114Q or H133Q (Fig. 3B), conforming with crucial functions in PON1 where His115 deprotonates water to create a lactone-attacking hydroxide and His134 establishes H115 basicity (11Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 7649-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A similar effect was observed with PON2-D268A, which likely disturbs binding of the catalytic calcium. This emphasizes the requirement of the two enzyme-bound calcium ions, which adds to previous studies (11Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 16Teiber J.F. Horke S. Haines D.C. Chowdhary P.K. Xiao J. Kramer G.L. Haley R.W. Draganov D.I. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and suggests similar hydrolytic mechanisms of PON1 and PON2. However, although glycosylation was dispensable for secretion and activity of PON1 (27Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Yagur S. Toker L. Silman I. Tawfik D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) showed that glycosylation of PON2 influenced lactonase activity. In accord with the latter, we also found that PON2-N254A/N323A lacked activity (Fig. 3B). To exclude that lost activity resulted merely from disturbed initial folding due to lacking glycosylation, we also analyzed lysates with prior deglycosylation, upon which active PON2-WT again lost activity (not shown). In contrast to Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), however, we did not observe any impact of natural polymorphism Ser/Cys311 on 3OC12 hydrolysis (Fig. 3B). We finally tested whether mutations that abrogate lactonase activity also influence ROS reduction. Importantly, PON2-H114Q and -H133Q (and also -S311C) were similar to WT in their ability to reduce ROS (Fig. 4A), which implies independent hydrolytic and anti-oxidative functions. Similarly, additional experiments demonstrate direct mitochondrial functions of PON2-WT and -H114Q on steps subsequent to O2·· formation (i.e. cardiolipin peroxidation, cytochrome c release, etc.), suggesting that the anti-apoptotic effect of PON2 is based on ROS reduction (not shown);4 in accordance, PON2-H114Q and/or PON2-H133Q equaled PON2-WT in preventing induction of apoptosis, which we here assessed by investigating activation of caspase-3, loss in intracellular ATP levels, and annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D flow cytometry (Fig. 4, C–E, respectively). The fact that PON2-H114Q and PON2-H133Q prevented apoptosis somewhat better than PON2-WT agrees with their slightly better performance in reduction of ROS. ROS and reactive nitrogen species are not just harmful but also vital to cell function, and some clinical trials demonstrated even augmented mortality after anti-oxidant treatment (31Linnane A.W. Kios M. Vitetta L. Mitochondrion. 2007; 7: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Thomson M.J. Puntmann V. Kaski J.C. Cardiovasc.

Med. 2005; 142: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Hence, the outcome of anti-oxidant treatment depends on the overall context, the cell type, efficient targeting, and the nature of the radical species and its detoxification product. Previous reports on PON2 demonstrated its anti-oxidative function (8Ng C.J. Bourquard N. Grijalva V. Hama S. Shih D.M. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Young S. Reddy S.T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) but barely addressed targeting or specificity. Here we show that PON2 prevents O2·· generation at the inner mitochondrial membrane, presumably by modulating CoQ, which provides mechanistic insight into a cancer-related, anti-apoptotic function of PON2.4 Studies with SOD1−/− or SOD2−/− mice revealed that mitochondrial O2·· is far more detrimental than cytosolic O2·· (34Wallace D.C. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 71-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). SOD2−/− mice suffered from neonatal death, defects in electron transport chain, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced cytochrome c release. So far, this has not been reported for the PON2-deficient mice (8Ng C.J. Bourquard N. Grijalva V. Hama S. Shih D.M. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Young S. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29491-29500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). As another difference, we revealed that PON2 prevented O2·· generation but was ineffective against existing radicals, whereas the reverse applies to SOD2. From such a perspective, these enzymes may synergize to avert overwhelming mitochondrial O2·· levels. We did not find an association of PON2 with distinct respiratory complexes, and PON2 prevented O2·· production from both complex I and complex III, which together suggests a modulation of or interaction with CoQ. A PON2 mutant lacking solely the anti-oxidative effect would be very valuable in studying ROS-related functions of the protein. However, despite all effort, we and other laboratories did not find such mutants. For PON1, enzymatic activity may give rise to its anti-oxidative role, but our data suggest that this is different for PON2. We also inserted mutations other than the ones reported here (not shown). For instance, PON2-C283A and -C283V were constructed as the corresponding residue in PON1 may be involved in its anti-oxidative function. However, this PON2 mutation was hardly tolerated by cells and did not appear to impact on the reported activities. Further, we truncated the amino-terminal residues 1–26 as this region likely represents the membrane attachment site of PON2 such that its deletion may have altered localization and function, but cells did not express it to reasonable levels. We also used the 12-residue-shorter isoform-2 of PON2 (9Horke S. Witte I. Wilgenbus P. Krüger M. Strand D. Förstermann U. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2055-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but this mutant appeared to induce cell cycle arrest for yet unknown reasons (not shown), which confounds analyses of cell death. Given the fact that all named mutants did not impact on ROS and considering the now characterized anti-oxidative mechanism of PON2, we argue that PON2, in the simplest model, may act as an insulator for CoQ to prevent coincidental superoxide production at the inner mitochondrial membrane, a principal that applies to several proteins (23Murphy M.P. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (5394) Google Scholar). Apparently, this may culminate in cancer as some tumors could exploit PON2 and enhance its expression to evade ROS-mediated apoptotic signaling.4 Together with the fact that PON2 most likely lacks redox-active groups or co-factors (e.g. those present in SODs), this collectively implies that there may not exist such a mutant that inhibits the anti-oxidative activity of PON2 unless its proposed interactions with CoQ, folding, or targeting are disturbed. Most of our understanding on PONs come from PON1, especially due to structural data and functional characteristics (11Harel M. Aharoni A. Gaidukov L. Brumshtein B. Khersonsky O. Meged R. Dvir H. Ravelli R.B. McCarthy A. Toker L. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Tawfik D.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 28Khersonsky O. Tawfik D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7649-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Rosenblat M. Gaidukov L. Khersonsky O. Vaya J. Oren R. Tawfik D.S. Aviram M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7657-7665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Despite differences in substrate specificity and localization (i.e. secretion) of the PONs, their high conservation suggested similar enzymatic mechanisms. Indeed, the histidine dyad His114/His133 in PON2 and His115/His134 in PON1 are similarly fundamental. Also, it is known that PONs stripped of their calcium lose activity (16Teiber J.F. Horke S. Haines D.C. Chowdhary P.K. Xiao J. Kramer G.L. Haley R.W. Draganov D.I. Infect. Immun. 2008; 76: 2512-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which we confirmed by mutating residues likely involved in calcium binding (D268A). An exception, however, seems to be glycosylation because unglycosylated PON1 still had ∼50% activity (35Josse D. Xie W. Renault F. Rochu D. Schopfer L.M. Masson P. Lockridge O. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2816-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas deglycosylated PON2 was inactive. Unlike PON1, PON2 is not present on high density lipoprotein particles (20Ng C.J. Wadleigh D.J. Gangopadhyay A. Hama S. Grijalva V.R. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Reddy S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44444-44449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar); thus, glycosylation may dictate structural arrangements critical to the specific environment or substrate binding in particular. Further, the role of the polymorphism Ser/Cys311 of PON2 remains controversial. Recently, Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) claimed that Cys311 impaired PON2 activity, but we did not observe this effect. One putative confounder may come from technical differences (we measured 3OC12 hydrolysis directly, whereas Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) employed a Bio-assay). Also, we measured initial rates at a 3OC12 concentration of 50 μm, whereas Stoltz et al. (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) used 10 μm 3OC12 and did not measure initial rates. However, even if PON2-Cys311 hydrolyzed 3OC12 slower than WT (30Stoltz D.A. Ozer E.A. Recker T.J. Estin M. Yang X. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Zabner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35564-35571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we found no importance to the reduction of ROS or apoptosis. Together, we demonstrate that PON2 prevents mitochondria-derived superoxide formation, identify catalytically essential residues, and provide evidence that the anti-oxidative and hydrolytic activities are separate. This allows discrimination of putative roles of PON2 in host-pathogen interactions, atherosclerosis, or cancer. Download .pdf (.02 MB) Help with pdf files"

With human migration and HIV co-infections, it also is now found in all other parts of the globe (2Moncayo A. Silveira A.C. Mem. Inst.

Lancet. 2009; 373: 2025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Worldwide, an estimated 16 to 18 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (TC), and ∼50,000 people die each year (3Neva F.A. Cecil Medicine:Expert Consult. 23rd Ed. Saunders Elsevier, Philadelphia2007Google Scholar). The parasite is transmitted to humans and >100 mammalian species that form a reservoir by Triatomine insect vector (kissing bugs), bites, feces, and food contamination. The infection also spreads from mother to child, congenitally and by breastfeeding, via organ transplantation, and blood transfusion. In 2007, most blood banks in the U.S. began screening for Chagas disease (3Neva F.A. Cecil Medicine:Expert Consult. 23rd Ed. Saunders Elsevier, Philadelphia2007Google Scholar, 6Centers for Disease Control and PreventionMMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2007; 56: 141-143PubMed Google Scholar). After a nonspecific, frequently flu-like acute stage of infection, which sometimes passes unnoticed, TC enters the host cells, and the chronic stage develops in about one-third of patients 5 to 15 years later. Most often, it affects the heart (cardiomegaly, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, consequently causing heart failure and death) and the gastrointestinal tract (megaesophagus and megacolon), though the parasites can be found in other organs and tissues. sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) cytochrome P450 green fluorescent protein Trypanosoma brucei Trypanosoma cruzi (R)-4′-chloro-N-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)biphenyl-4-carboxamide. For more than a century, Chagas disease has remained one of the most neglected and deadly human infections with only two available clinical drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox. Toxic and nonspecific, they are effective only for the acute stage but do not cure the chronic stage of Chagas. Corticosteroids, pacemakers, and medications for treating cardiac arrhythmias are aimed only to manage the symptoms. Even heart transplantation or recently suggested development of stem cell therapy (7Soares M.B. Santos R.R. Mem. Inst .Oswaldo. Cruz. 2009; 104: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) cannot assure a cure because the parasite from other tissues often re-enters the heart (3Neva F.A. Cecil Medicine:Expert Consult. 23rd Ed. Saunders Elsevier, Philadelphia2007Google Scholar). Current approaches for development of new therapies for Chagas disease include blind screening for compounds that produce antiparasitic effects in cellular experiments, searches for new drug targets in the parasite genome, as well as searches for effective compounds to act on potential drug targets known to be essential for parasite biology (8Paulino M.

Ergosterol-like molecules are required for parasite membranes, growth, development, and division (11Roberts C.W. McLeod R. Rice D.W. Ginger M. Chance M.L. Goad L.J. Mol. Biochem.

Waterman M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). 14DM is strongly inhibited by heterocyclic compounds with a basic atom that coordinates to the heme iron affecting substrate binding and catalysis. 14DM inhibitors (imidazole and triazole derivatives; see Fig. 1a) are among the most efficient current antifungal drugs (14Petrikkos G.

In addition to blocking ergosterol production, antifungal azoles cause accumulation of toxic methylated sterol precursors, leading to pathogen growth arrest and cell death (16Nagappan V.

Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2009; 104: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Posaconazole is a highly potent broad spectrum antifungal drug, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 as salvage therapy for invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients (15Zonios D.I.

The disadvantages of this drug include its cost and severe adverse side effects, especially gastrointestinal problems, because the drug is produced only in an orally available form. To our knowledge, the direct inhibitory effect of posaconazole on 14DM catalysis has not yet been tested. Fluconazole is a cheap first generation antifungal agent (15Zonios D.I. Bennett J.E. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 29: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Water soluble and well tolerated, it easily penetrates the blood-brain barrier and currently is used for treatment of yeast infections but has much lower efficiency for filamentous fungi. VNF ((R)-4′-chloro-N-(1-(2,4-dichlorohenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)biphenyl-4-carboxamide) (Fig. 1b) is an experimental inhibitor (12Lepesheva G.I. Ott R.D. Hargrove T.Y. Kleshchenko Y.Y.

Highly potent for trypanosomal 14DMs, this compound displays low general cytotoxicity and does not inhibit the human 14DM ortholog, which makes this carboxamide-containing inhibitory scaffold potentially advantageous in the cases of long term treatment. Acquired azole resistance, the major problem in current fungal therapy (25Kanafani Z.A. Perfect J.R. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2008; 46: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), is another reason to search for new 14DM inhibitors. Activation of the efflux pumps that help to expel azoles from the fungal cells has been proven for ketoconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole (15Zonios D.I. Bennett J.E. Semin. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2008; 29: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Nagappan V. Deresinski S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2007; 45: 1610-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Schiller D.S. Fung H.B. Clin. Ther. 2007; 29: 1862-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Moreover, easily induced resistance to fluconazole was demonstrated in the laboratory strains of TC (26Buckner F.S. Wilson A.J. White T.C. Van Voorhis W.C. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 1998; 42: 3245-3250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Posaconazole has been reported not to induce the efflux pump mechanism (24Schiller D.S. Fung H.B. Clin. Ther. 2007; 29: 1862-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar); however, sparse cases of resistance associated with point mutations in the fungal 14DM have been observed (27Mann P.A. Parmegiani R.M. Wei S.Q. Mendrick C.A. Li X. Loebenberg D. DiDomenico B. Hare R.S. Walker S.S. McNicholas P.M. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2003; 47: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the structures of TC14DM, in complex with posaconazole, fluconazole, and VNF. Accompanied by comparative analysis of the inhibitor binding parameters, inhibitory potencies in the reconstituted enzyme reaction in vitro and antiparasitic effects in TC cells, the structural data not only elucidate inhibitory details but uncover important general aspects in 14DM inhibition, which we are showing to be likely applicable for the fungal 14DMs as well. Interestingly, despite the differences in the inhibitor structures, molecular volumes, and binding poses, they do not cause large scale conformational rearrangements in the enzyme, filling the available active site cavity without significantly changing its shape and topology. This characterizes 14DM as possibly one of the most structurally rigid members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (28Lepesheva G.I. Park H.W. Hargrove T.Y. Vanhollebeke B. Wawrzak Z. Harp J.M.

Analysis of the 14DM expression in TC confirms that the gene is regulated developmentally and essential at all stages of the parasite life cycle. In contrast to posaconazole and fluconazole, VNF does not induce an obvious increase in the 14DM gene expression. Low doses of VNF produce a steady antiparasitic effect over time, which distinguishes this inhibitory scaffold as a very promising lead for antitrypanosomal therapy. The gene-encoding 14DM was amplified from T. cruzi genomic DNA with the addition of a His6 tag at the protein C terminus and cloned into a pCW expression plasmid as described previously (29Lepesheva G.I.

The N-terminal truncation resulted in the increased expression levels of TC14DM, up to 0.7 and 1.5 μmol/liter for constructs 1 and 2, respectively. Truncated protein was purified following the same steps as the full-length TC14DM (29Lepesheva G.I. Zaitseva N.G. Nes W.D. Zhou W. Arase M. Liu J. Hill G.C. Waterman M.R. J. Biol.

The initial screening of crystallization conditions was performed using Hampton Research crystallization kits. Crystals were obtained in hanging drops at 25 °C from equal mixtures of 260 μm cytochrome P450 solution in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 200 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.048 mm n-tridecyl-β-d-maltoside preincubated with 1.2-fold molar excess of posaconazole or VNF and 2-fold molar excess of fluconazole against a well solution containing 0.2 m potassium formate, pH 7.2, or 0.2 m sodium formate, pH 7.4, in the case of VNF, and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3550. Crystals were soaked briefly in a 40% glycerol cryo-buffer and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team, beamline 21ID-F (posaconazole complex), and Southwest Regional Collaborative Access Team, beamlines 22ID and 22BM for fluconazole and VNF complexes. The data were processed with the HKL2000 software package (31Otninowski Z. Minor W. HKL Manual. Yale University, 1995Google Scholar). The posaconazole-bound structure was solved by molecular replacement using ligand-free Trypanosoma brucei (Tbb) 14DM (3g1q) as a search ensemble in PhaserMR (CCP4 suite; 32Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Model building and refinement were performed with COOT (33Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (CCP4 suite), respectively. Structures of the TC14DM complexes with fluconazole and VNF were solved using the coordinates of TC14DM complexed with posaconazole as a search ensemble. Supplemental Table S1 summarizes the diffraction and refinement data statistics. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under codes 3K1O, 3KHM, and 3KSW, for posaconazole, fluconazole, and VNF-bound TC14DM, respectively. The codes of other structures related to this work are 3G1Q and 3GW9 (Tbb14DM) and 3LD6 (most recent release for human 14DM). Structure superpositions were done in LSQkab of the CCP4 suite. Molecular volumes were calculated in Accelrys Discovery Studio Visualizer 2.5 (probe radius 1.4 Å). Figures were prepared with Accelrys, Chimera, and PyMOL. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a dual-beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC) in 1-cm optical path length quartz cuvettes. P450 concentration was quantified from the Soret band absolute absorbance of the ligand-free ferric form of the protein and confirmed by carbon monoxide difference spectra using extinction coefficients ϵ418 nm and Δϵ(490–448) nm of 117 and 91 mm−1 cm−1, respectively (29Lepesheva G.I.

Titrations with the inhibitors were carried out at cytochrome P450 concentration of 2 μm and difference spectra were recorded between 350 and 500 nm. The apparent dissociation constants were calculated by plotting P450 spectral response (ΔA420–390) against free ligand concentration as described previously (30Lepesheva G.I. Virus C. Waterman M.R.

Difference CO-binding spectra were recorded between 400 and 500 nm, 14DM was reduced with sodium dithionite, and CO gas was bubbled through the sample cuvette.

Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence (catalog no. 34077, Thermo Fisher Scientific). T. cruzi epimastigotes (108 organisms) were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and embedded in low acryl resin as described (36Madison M.N. Kleshchenko Y.Y. Nde P.N. Simmons K.J. Lima M.F. Villalta F.

Ultrathin cell sections were probed with mouse anti-Tbb14DM antiserum or with mouse preimmune serum, followed by incubation with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 10-nm gold particles (catalog no. RPN431V, GE Healthcare), stained with 0.25% phosphotungstic acid as described (36Madison M.N. Kleshchenko Y.Y. Nde P.N. Simmons K.J. Lima M.F. Villalta F. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 4780-4791Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and observed with a Phillips CM-12 electron microscope. The sections probed with preimmune serum did not show reactivity. T. cruzi-expressing GFP were generated by transfection with pTRex-GFP plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. P. Guevara) (37Guevara P. Dias M. Rojas A. Crisante G. Abreu-Blanco M.T. Umezawa E. Vazquez M. Levin M. Añez N. Ramirez J.L. J. Med. Entomol. 2005; 42: 48-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by clonal selection with G418. A single clone of epimastigotes with high GFP expression was used to generate GFP-transgenic trypomastigotes by metacyclogenesis in low pH buffer. For inhibition of T. cruzi infection within cardiomyoblasts by 14DM inhibitors, GFP-expressing trypomastigotes (8 × 104 organisms) were pretreated for 30 min with several concentrations of the inhibitors dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium free of phenol red and exposed in triplicates to cardiomyocyte monolayers (each at 4 × 103 cells) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 12 h. Unbound trypomastigotes were removed by washing with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Infected monolayers were incubated for 72 h for parasite multiplication and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the infection was quantified using a Synergy HT fluorometer (Biotek Instruments). For fluorescence microscopic observation of the inhibition of T. cruzi multiplication within cardiomyocytes, the monolayers were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize DNA. T. cruzi epimastigotes (106 cells/ml) were exposed to different concentrations of 14DM inhibitors and mock-treated in triplicates, and the kinetics of growth in brain infusion medium was evaluated microscopically during 6 days. Although the apparent Kds determined by spectral titration are useful for primary identification of new binding ligands, they do not always correlate with inhibition of 14DM activity (12Lepesheva G.I. Ott R.D. Hargrove T.Y. Kleshchenko Y.Y. Schuster I. Nes W.D. Hill G.C. Villalta F. Waterman M.R. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1283-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, we found that several imidazole derivatives that reveal nanomolar Kds were easily replaced in the enzyme reaction by substrate, whereas VNF derivatives were not (12Lepesheva G.I. Ott R.D.

On the other hand, some pyridine derivatives, which induce moderate spectral responses (the apparent Kds ∼ 0.2–0.5 μm), turned out to be rather strong inhibitors of TC14DM (38Konkle M.E. Hargrove T.Y. Kleshchenko Y.Y. von Kries J.P. Ridenour W. Uddin M.J. Caprioli R.M. Marnett L.J. Nes W.D. Villalta F. Waterman M.R. Lepesheva G.I. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 2846-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This contradiction might be explained by the fact that because 14DM spectral responses to azoles (an example is shown in supplemental Fig. S1a) only reflect displacement of a weaker ligand (water) from the sixth iron coordination sphere (28Lepesheva G.I. Park H.W. Hargrove T.Y. Vanhollebeke B. Wawrzak Z. Harp J.M. Sundaramoorthy M. Nes W.D. Pays E. Chaudhuri M. Villalta F. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), they might be enhanced by basicity of the iron-coordinating atom (imidazole > triazole > pyridine (39Ghomari M. Mokhlisse R. Laurence C. Le Questel J.Y. Bertelot M. J. Phys. Org. Chem. 1997; 10: 669-674Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), whereas the effects of additional lipophilic interactions with the protein residues may sometimes remain unrecognized. Therefore, to estimate the inhibitors relative affinities to 14DM, we also have monitored their influence on the formation of the reduced P450-CO complexes (supplemental Fig. S1b). This approach appears to be rather sensitive, because it reflects the ability of CO to replace the inhibitors in the iron coordination sphere while the enzyme is in the reduced, reactive state. Based on the binding parameters and inhibitory effects on enzyme activity (Table 1), fluconazole is the weakest ligand/inhibitor for TC14DM, whereas the potencies of posaconazole and VNF are comparable; they both completely inhibit TC14DM activity at 1:1 molar ratio inhibitor/enzyme, yet VNF reveals higher selectivity (no influence on the host (human) 14DM catalysis at up to 200-fold molar excess).TABLE 1Binding parameters and inhibition of 14DM activity by posaconazole, fluconazole, and VNFTC14DMNo azolePosaconazoleFluconazoleVNFAzole binding: spectral titrations of ferric formSoret band maximum (nm)418.5422.5422.5424.5Apparent Kd (μm)0.06 ± 0.01 (1.9 ± 0.12)aData in parentheses are for the human 14DM ortholog.0.44 ± 0.03 (40 ± 2.11)0.07 ± 0.01 (0.3 ± 0.04)Influence on CO complex formation: ferrous formRate (%/min)80nddnd, not determined.22nddnd, not determined.Total (%)100<570<5Inhibitory effect on 14DM catalysisI/E2bThis refers to the molar ratio inhibitor/enzyme that causes a 2-fold decrease in the initial rate of catalysis (12).<1 (40)1.8 (>200)<1 (>200)Activity at 1:1 molar ratio I/E (%)cThe P450 concentration in the reaction was 1 μm (see “Experimental Procedures”).Initial rate0700Substrate conversion after a 1-h reaction01000a Data in parentheses are for the human 14DM ortholog.b This refers to the molar ratio inhibitor/enzyme that causes a 2-fold decrease in the initial rate of catalysis (12Lepesheva G.I.

Only two loop regions, FG and GH, that have the highest B-factor (elevated flexibility) in Tbb14DM (1.9 Å) in the TC14DM structures clearly display different conformations and are partially disordered (Fig. 3, left panel). Similar to the inhibitor-bound Tbb14DM, the middle portion of the I helix (Ala291 region) in the TC14DM-inhibitor complexes is pushed ∼1.5 Å away from the heme iron (Fig. 2), releasing additional space for azole ring coordination, thus supporting our previous suggestion (28Lepesheva G.I.

https://openalex.org/W2049315580,"Growing evidence suggests that a novel member of the Chlamydiales order, Waddlia chondrophila, is a potential agent of miscarriage in humans and abortion in ruminants. Due to the lack of genetic tools to manipulate chlamydia, genomic analysis is proving to be the most incisive tool in stimulating investigations into the biology of these obligate intracellular bacteria. 454/Roche and Solexa/Illumina technologies were thus used to sequence and assemble de novo the full genome of the first representative of the Waddliaceae family, W. chondrophila. The bacteria possesses a 2'116'312 bp chromosome and a 15'593 bp low-copy number plasmid that might integrate into the bacterial chromosome. The Waddlia genome displays numerous repeated sequences indicating different genome dynamics from classical chlamydia which almost completely lack repetitive elements. Moreover, W. chondrophila exhibits many virulence factors also present in classical chlamydia, including a functional type III secretion system, but also a large complement of specific factors for resistance to host or environmental stresses. Large families of outer membrane proteins were identified indicating that these highly immunogenic proteins are not Chlamydiaceae specific and might have been present in their last common ancestor. Enhanced metabolic capability for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, lipids and other co-factors suggests that the common ancestor of the modern Chlamydiales may have been less dependent on their eukaryotic host. The fine-detailed analysis of biosynthetic pathways brings us closer to possibly developing a synthetic medium to grow W. chondrophila, a critical step in the development of genetic tools. As a whole, the availability of the W. chondrophila genome opens new possibilities in Chlamydiales research, providing new insights into the evolution of members of the order Chlamydiales and the biology of the Waddliaceae."
https://openalex.org/W2138162490,"Somatically acquired, activating mutations of GNAS, the gene encoding the stimulatory G-protein Gsalpha subunit, have been identified in kidney, thyroid, pituitary, leydig cell, adrenocortical and, more recently, in colorectal tumours, suggesting that mutations such as R201C may be oncogenic in these tissues. To study the role of GNAS in intestinal tumourigenesis, we placed GNAS R201C under the control of the A33-antigen promoter (Gpa33), which is almost exclusively expressed in the intestines. The GNAS R201C mutation has been shown to result in the constitutive activation of Gsalpha and adenylate cyclase and to lead to the autonomous synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Gpa33(tm1(GnasR201C)Wtsi/+) mice showed significantly elevated cAMP levels and a compensatory upregulation of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases in the intestinal epithelium. GNAS R201C alone was not sufficient to induce tumourigenesis by 12 months, but there was a significant increase in adenoma formation when Gpa33(tm1(GnasR201C)Wtsi/+) mice were bred onto an Apc(Min/+) background. GNAS R201C expression was associated with elevated expression of Wnt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK) pathway target genes, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK and increased immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki67. Furthermore, the effects of GNAS R201C on the Wnt pathway were additive to the inactivation of Apc. Our data strongly suggest that activating mutations of GNAS cooperate with inactivation of APC and are likely to contribute to colorectal tumourigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2147254035,"Major unresolved questions regarding vertebrate limb development concern how the numbers of skeletal elements along the proximodistal (P-D) and anteroposterior (A-P) axes are determined and how the shape of a growing limb affects skeletal element formation. There is currently no generally accepted model for these patterning processes, but recent work on cartilage development (chondrogenesis) indicates that precartilage tissue self-organizes into nodular patterns by cell-molecular circuitry with local auto-activating and lateral inhibitory (LALI) properties. This process is played out in the developing limb in the context of a gradient of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) emanating from the apical ectodermal ridge (AER).We have simulated the behavior of the core chondrogenic mechanism of the developing limb in the presence of an FGF gradient using a novel computational environment that permits simulation of LALI systems in domains of varying shape and size. The model predicts the normal proximodistal pattern of skeletogenesis as well as distal truncations resulting from AER removal. Modifications of the model's parameters corresponding to plausible effects of Hox proteins and formins, and of the reshaping of the model limb, bud yielded simulated phenotypes resembling mutational and experimental variants of the limb. Hypothetical developmental scenarios reproduce skeletal morphologies with features of fossil limbs.The limb chondrogenic regulatory system operating in the presence of a gradient has an inherent, robust propensity to form limb-like skeletal structures. The bare bones framework can accommodate ancillary gene regulatory networks controlling limb bud shaping and establishment of Hox expression domains. This mechanism accounts for major features of the normal limb pattern and, under variant geometries and different parameter values, those of experimentally manipulated, genetically aberrant and evolutionary early forms, with no requirement for an independent system of positional information."

We identified a role of DISC1 in the cell biology of primary cilia that display disease-relevant dopamine receptors. Methodology/Principal Findings A GFP-tagged DISC1 construct expressed in NIH3T3 cells and rat striatal neurons localized near the base of primary cilia. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous DISC1 resulted in a marked reduction in the number of cells expressing a primary cilium. FLAG-tagged versions of the cloned human D1, D2 and D5 dopamine receptors concentrated highly on the ciliary surface, and this reflects a specific targeting mechanism specific because D3 and D4 receptors localized to the plasma membrane but were not concentrated on cilia. Conclusions/Significance These results identify a role of DISC1 in regulating the formation and/or maintenance of primary cilia, and establish subtype-specific targeting of dopamine receptors to the ciliary surface. Our findings provide new insight to receptor cell biology and suggest a relationship between DISC1 and neural dopamine signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2012231233,"Aberrant matrix deposition is a hallmark of pulmonary fibrosis and is characterized by an imbalance between matrix deposition and degradation. We have previously shown that mice harboring a conditional deletion of the GTP-binding protein, Rac1, in macrophages are protected from asbestos-induced pulmonary fibrosis. To investigate the contribution of aberrant matrix degradation, we addressed the role of Rac1 in regulating expression of macrophage-specific MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9). We found that MMP-9 gene transcription was significantly greater in Rac1 null macrophages. Deletion and mutational analysis of the MMP-9 promoter revealed that both SP-1 and AP-1 are essential for MMP-9 transcription. Overexpression of constitutive active Rac1 (V12) revealed that H(2)O(2) was derived from the mitochondria. Rac1-induced H(2)O(2) generation down-regulated MMP-9 gene transcription, whereas catalase overexpression in WT cells enhanced MMP-9 expression. SP-1 interacted directly with both c-Jun and c-Fos, and H(2)O(2) decreased this binding, suggesting that SP-1 and AP-1 function cooperatively to regulate MMP-9 transcription. Rac1-mediated H(2)O(2) inhibited the ERK MAPK, which was essential for activation of SP-1 and AP-1. ERK activation and MMP-9 expression were recovered by overexpressing catalase or transfecting siRNA for the mitochondrial iron-sulfur protein, Rieske. These observations were recapitulated in vivo. MMP-9 mRNA was higher in alveolar macrophages isolated from Rac1 null mice and wild type mice given catalase. Rac1 regulates MMP-9 transcription via mitochondrial H(2)O(2) generation, providing a potential mechanism by which Rac1 null mice fail to develop pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2010497591,"Mutations in the dynamin 2 gene have been identified in patients with autosomal dominant forms of centronuclear myopathy (CNM). Dynamin 2 is a ubiquitously expressed approximately 100-kDa GTPase that assembles around the necks of vesiculating membranes and promotes their constriction and scission. It has also been implicated in regulation of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons. At present, the cellular functions of dynamin 2 that are affected by CNM-linked mutations are not well defined, and the effects of these mutations on the physical and enzymatic properties of dynamin have been not examined. Here, we report the expression, purification, and characterization of four CNM-associated dynamin mutants. All four mutants display higher than wild-type GTPase activities, and more importantly, the mutants form high order oligomers that are significantly more resistant than wild-type dynamin 2 to disassembly by guanine nucleotides or high ionic strength. These observations suggest that the corresponding wild-type residues serve to prevent excessive or prolonged dynamin assembly on cellular membranes or inappropriate self-assembly in the cytoplasm. To our knowledge, this report contains the first identification of point mutations that enhance the stability of dynamin polymers without impairing their ability to bind and/or hydrolyze GTP. We envision that the formation of abnormally large and stable complexes of these dynamin mutants in vivo contributes to their role in CNM pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2040163154,"Inflammatory lung disease is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Mechanisms of unresolved acute inflammation in CF are not completely known, although the involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in nonrespiratory cells is emerging. Here we examined CFTR expression and function in human platelets (PLTs) and found that they express a biologically active CFTR. CFTR blockade gave an ∼50% reduction in lipoxin A4 (LXA4) formation during PLT/polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) coincubations by inhibiting the lipoxin synthase activity of PLT 12-lipoxygenase. PLTs from CF patients generated ∼40% less LXA4 compared to healthy subject PLTs. CFTR inhibition increased PLT-dependent PMN viability (33.0±5.7 vs. 61.2±8.2%; P=0.033), suppressed nitric oxide generation (0.23±0.04 vs. 0.11±0.002 pmol/108 PLTs; P= 0.004), while reducing AKT (1.02±0.12 vs. 0.71±0.007 U; P=0.04), and increasing p38 MAPK phosphorylation (0.650±0.09 vs. 1.04±0.24 U; P=0.03). Taken together, these findings indicate that PLTs from CF patients are affected by the molecular defect of CFTR. Moreover, this CF PLT abnormality may explain the failure of resolution in CF.—Mattoscio, D., Evangelista, V., De Cristofaro, R., Recchiuti, A., Pandolfi, A., Di Silvestre, S., Manarini, S., Martelli, N., Rocca, B., Petrucci, B., Angelini, D.F., Battistini, L., Robuffo, I., Pensabene, T., Pieroni, L., Furnari, M.L., Pardo, F., Quattrucci, S., Lancellotti, S., Davi, G., Romano, M.

https://openalex.org/W1997628912,"Host-tumor cell interactions are recognized to be critical in tumor development. We have shown that group VIA phospholipase A2 [calcium-independent phospholipase A2β (iPLA2β)] is important in regulating extracellular lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) levels around human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells. To explore the role of iPLA2β in host-tumor cell interactions, we have used immunocompetent iPLA2β knockout (iPLA2β−/−) mice and the mouse EOC cell line ID8. Tumorigenesis and ascites formation were reduced in iPLA2β−/− mice compared with wild-type (WT) mice by more >50% and were reduced further when ID8 cell iPLA2β levels were lowered (by>95%) with shRNA. LPA and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels in the tumor microenvironment were reduced to ∼80% of WT levels in iPLA2β−/− mice. LPA, but not LPC, stimulated ID8 cell migration and invasion with cells in which iPLA2β expression had been down-regulated in vitro. LPA, but not LPC, also enhanced in vivo ascites formation (by ∼5-fold) and tumorigenesis in iPLA2β−/− mice. This is the first demonstration of a role for host cell iPLA2β in cancer, and these findings suggest that iPLA2β is a potential target for developing novel antineoplastic therapeutic strategies.—Li, H., Zhao, Z., Wei, G., Yan, L., Wang, D., Zhang, H., Sandusky, G.

https://openalex.org/W1985688040,"An alarming portion of patients develop persistent or chronic pain following surgical procedures, but the mechanisms underlying the transition from acute to chronic pain states are not fully understood. In general, endocannabinoids (ECBs) inhibit nociceptive processing by stimulating cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB(1)) and type 2 (CB(2)). We have previously shown that intrathecal administration of a CB(2) receptor agonist reverses both surgical incision-induced behavioral hypersensitivity and associated over-expression of spinal glial markers. We therefore hypothesized that endocannabinoid signaling promotes the resolution of acute postoperative pain by modulating pro-inflammatory signaling in spinal cord glial cells.To test this hypothesis, rats receiving paw incision surgery were used as a model of acute postoperative pain that spontaneously resolves. We first characterized the concentration of ECBs and localization of CB(1) and CB(2) receptors in the spinal cord following paw incision. We then administered concomitant CB(1) and CB(2) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists (AM281 and AM630, 1 mg x kg(-1) each, i.p.) during the acute phase of paw incision-induced mechanical allodynia and evaluated the expression of glial cell markers and phosphorylated p38 (a MAPK associated with inflammation) in the lumbar dorsal horn. Dual blockade of CB(1) and CB(2) receptor signaling prevented the resolution of postoperative allodynia and resulted in persistent over-expression of spinal Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP, an astrocytic marker) and phospho-p38 in astrocytes. We provide evidence for the functional significance of these astrocytic changes by demonstrating that intrathecal administration of propentofylline (50 microg, i.t.) attenuated both persistent behavioral hypersensitivity and over-expression of GFAP and phospho-p38 in antagonist-treated animals.Our results demonstrate that endocannabinoid signaling via CB(1) and CB(2) receptors is necessary for the resolution of paw incision-induced behavioral hypersensitivity and for the limitation of pro-inflammatory signaling in astrocytes following surgical insult. Our findings suggest that therapeutic strategies designed to enhance endocannabinoid signaling may prevent patients from developing persistent or chronic pain states following surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2027982680,"The antimalarial drugs artemisinins have been described as inhibiting Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of PfATP6 (Plasmodium falciparum ATP6) after expression in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of an amino acid residue in mammalian SERCA1 (Glu(255)) to the equivalent one predicted in PfATP6 (Leu) was reported to induce sensitivity to artemisinin in the oocyte system. However, in the present experiments, we found that artemisinin did not inhibit mammalian SERCA1a E255L either when expressed in COS cells or after purification of the mutant expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we found that PfATP6 after expression and purification from S. cerevisiae was insensitive to artemisinin and significantly less sensitive to thapsigargin and 2,5-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone than rabbit SERCA1 but retained higher sensitivity to cyclopiazonic acid, another type of SERCA1 inhibitor. Although mammalian SERCA and purified PfATP6 appear to have different pharmacological profiles, their insensitivity to artemisinins suggests that the mechanism of action of this class of drugs on the calcium metabolism in the intact cell is complex and cannot be ascribed to direct inhibition of PfATP6. Furthermore, the successful purification of PfATP6 affords the opportunity to develop new antimalarials by screening for inhibitors against PfATP6."

Profiling of hydrolases in Huh7 cells replicating HCV identified CES1 (carboxylesterase 1) as a differentially active enzyme. CES1 is an endogenous liver protein involved in processing of triglycerides and cholesterol. We observe that CES1 expression and activity were altered in the presence of HCV. The knockdown of CES1 with siRNA resulted in lower levels of HCV replication, and up-regulation of CES1 was observed to favor HCV propagation, implying an important role for this host cell protein. Experiments in HCV JFH1-infected cells suggest that CES1 facilitates HCV release because less intracellular HCV core protein was observed, whereas HCV titers remained high. CES1 activity was observed to increase the size and density of lipid droplets, which are necessary for the maturation of very low density lipoproteins, one of the likely vehicles for HCV release. In transgenic mice containing human-mouse chimeric livers, HCV infection also correlates with higher levels of endogenous CES1, providing further evidence that CES1 has an important role in HCV propagation.

https://openalex.org/W1964556975,"Epigenetic regulation by CpG methylation has an important role in tumorigenesis as well as in the response to cancer therapy. To analyze the mechanism of epigenetic control of radiosensitivity, the CpG methylation profiles of radiosensitive H460 and radioresistant H1299 human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines were analyzed using microarray profiling. These analyses revealed 1091 differentially methylated genes (DMG) (absolute difference of mean beta-values, |Deltabeta |>0.5), including genes involved in cell adhesion, cell communication, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation. Among the 747 genes hypermethylated in radioresistant H1299 cells, CpG methylation of SERPINB5 and S100A6 in radioresistant H1299 cells was confirmed by methylation-specific PCR. Reverse transcriptase-PCR showed higher expression of these two genes in radiosensitive H460 cells compared with radioresistant H1299 cells. Downregulation of SERPINB5 or S100A6 by small interfering RNA in H460 cells increased the resistance of these cells to ionizing radiation. In contrast, promoter CpG sites of 344 genes, including CAT and BNC1, were hypomethylated in radioresistant H1299 cells. Suppression of CAT or BNC1 mRNA expression in H1299 cells also reduced the resistance of these cells to ionizing radiation. Thus, we identified DMGs by genome-wide CpG methylation profiling in two NSCLC cell lines with different responses to ionizing radiation, and our data indicated that these differences may be critical for epigenetic regulation of radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968249689,"Background Drug resistant (DR) and multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) is increasing worldwide. In some parts of the world 10% or more of new TB cases are MDR. The Beijing genotype is a distinct genetic lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is distributed worldwide, and has caused large outbreaks of MDR-TB. It has been proposed that certain lineages of M. tuberculosis, such as the Beijing lineage, may have specific adaptive advantages. We have investigated the presence and transmission of DR Beijing strains in the Swedish population. Methodology/Principal Findings All DR M. tuberculosis complex isolates between 1994 and 2008 were studied. Isolates that were of Beijing genotype were investigated for specific resistance mutations and phylogenetic markers. Seventy (13%) of 536 DR strains were of Beijing genotype. The majority of the patients with Beijing strains were foreign born, and their country of origin reflects the countries where the Beijing genotype is most prevalent. Multidrug-resistance was significantly more common in Beijing strains than in non-Beijing strains. There was a correlation between the Beijing genotype and specific resistance mutations in the katG gene, the mabA-inhA-promotor and the rpoB gene. By a combined use of RD deletions, spoligotyping, IS1547, mutT gene polymorphism and Rv3135 gene analysis the Beijing strains could be divided into 11 genomic sublineages. Of the patients with Beijing strains 28 (41%) were found in altogether 10 clusters (2–5 per cluster), as defined by RFLP IS6110, while 52% of the patients with non-Beijing strains were in clusters. By 24 loci MIRU-VNTR 31 (45%) of the patients with Beijing strains were found in altogether 7 clusters (2–11 per cluster). Contact tracing established possible epidemiological linkage between only two patients with Beijing strains. Conclusions/Significance Although extensive outbreaks with non-Beijing TB strains have occurred in Sweden, Beijing strains have not taken hold, in spite of the proximity to high prevalence countries such as Russia and the Baltic countries. The Beijing sublineages so far introduced in Sweden may not be adapted to spread in the Scandinavian population."
https://openalex.org/W2016322057,"Sodium channel Na(v)1.6 is essential for neuronal excitability in central and peripheral nervous systems. Loss-of-function mutations in Na(v)1.6 underlie motor disorders, with homozygous-null mutations causing juvenile lethality. Phosphorylation of Na(v)1.6 by the stress-induced p38 MAPK at a Pro-Gly-Ser(553)-Pro motif in its intracellular loop L1 reduces Na(v)1.6 current density in a dorsal root ganglion-derived cell line, without changing its gating properties. Phosphorylated Pro-Gly-Ser(553)-Pro motif is a putative binding site to Nedd4 ubiquitin ligases, and we hypothesized that Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligases may contribute to channel ubiquitination and internalization. We report here that p38 activation in hippocampal neurons from wild-type mice, but not from Scn8a(medtg) mice that lack Na(v)1.6, reduces tetrodotoxin-S sodium currents, suggesting isoform-specific modulation of Na(v)1.6 by p38 in these neurons. Pharmacological block of endocytosis completely abolishes p38-mediated Na(v)1.6 current reduction, supporting our hypothesis that channel internalization underlies current reduction. We also report that the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 interacts with Na(v)1.6 via a Pro-Ser-Tyr(1945) motif in the C terminus of the channel and reduces Na(v)1.6 current density, and we show that this regulation requires both the Pro-Gly-Ser-Pro motif in L1 and the Pro-Ser-Tyr motif in the C terminus. Similarly, both motifs are necessary for p38-mediated reduction of Na(v)1.6 current, whereas abrogating binding of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to the Pro-Ser-Tyr motif results in stress-mediated increase in Na(v)1.6 current density. Thus, phosphorylation of the Pro-Gly-Ser-Pro motif within L1 of Na(v)1.6 is necessary for stress-induced current modulation, with positive or negative regulation depending upon the availability of the C-terminal Pro-Ser-Tyr motif to bind Nedd4-2."

To investigate the functional effects of silencing SAP97 on IK1 in adult rat ventricular myocytes, SAP97 was silenced using an adenoviral short hairpin RNA vector. Western blot analysis showed that SAP97 was silenced by ∼85% on day 3 post-infection. Immunostaining showed that Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 co-localize with SAP97. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) results demonstrated that Kir2.x channels associate with SAP97. Voltage clamp experiments showed that silencing SAP97 reduced IK1 whole cell density by ∼55%.

The hearts were cannulated on a Langendorff apparatus and perfused for 5 min with modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB-A) (in mm) containing NaCl (118), KCl (4.8), HEPES (25), K2HPO4 (1.25), MgSO4 (1.25), glucose (11), CaCl2 (1), pH 7.40, with NaOH. Hearts were perfused with KHB-A until the blood cleared followed by KHB lacking Ca2+ (KHB-B) for another 5 min or until the heart stopped beating. The KHB-B solution containing collagenase type II (200 units/ml), hyaluronidase (0.4 mg/ml), and blebbistatin (33.3 μm) was then recirculated for 15 min. The enzymatically digested ventricles were isolated, minced, and gently shaken in digestion solution. Undigested ventricular tissue was removed using a 250-μm mesh sieve. The cell suspension from the previous step was centrifuged (800 × g), and the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 1 mm after resuspending the cell pellet in KHB-A containing 2% bovine serum albumin and blebbistatin (50 μm).

For negative controls, cells were treated with an alternative adenoviral construct sense, 5′-GAGGTAGCTGAACTGAATG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GACCTACTTCAGCTACCT-3′, containing an shRNA that has been previously used as a negative control (10Oxford E.M. Musa H. Maass K. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted at multiplicities of infection of 100, and samples were collected from days 2 to 4 after infection. Silencing of SAP97 expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis on whole cell lysate. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control for these experiments. All procedures were performed at 2–4 °C. Rat ventricular tissue or isolated cardiomyocyte samples were homogenized with 10 volumes of buffer A containing (in mm) sucrose (320), EDTA (5), EGTA (5), PMSF (1), protease inhibitor mixture (1) (Roche Applied Science), HEPES (20), pH 7.5. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and DNA. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were then solubilized in HNNS buffer containing (in mm) IGEPAL CA-630 (1%), SDS (0.1%), NaCl (150), HEPES (20), and protease inhibitor mixture (1), pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin of known concentration was used to calculate the standard concentration curve. Ionic detergent compatibility reagent (Pierce) was used to counteract the effect of ionic detergent on the protein assay. All samples were analyzed in triplicate at three different dilutions for accuracy and then averaged to determine the protein concentration. Membrane preparations of known concentration were then used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments (see below) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For each co-IP reaction, ∼4 mg of total membrane protein was used. Membrane proteins solubilized in HNNS buffer were pre-cleared with the addition of recombinant protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce or Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After a brief spin, the pre-cleared supernatant was incubated with primary antibodies (4–15 μg/reaction) overnight at 4 °C, and protein-antibody complexes were recovered using recombinant protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Pierce or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described below. Primary antibodies for Kir2.1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and/or Antibodies Inc.; Kir2.2 was from Millipore and/or Antibodies Inc.; Kir2.3 was from Alomone; β1AR was from Abcam and/or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; PKA and SAP97 were from Assay Designs Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Antibody dilutions were used as specified by the manufacturer. 4–20% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine buffer were used to separate proteins. Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad, 0.45 μm pore size). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% nonfat dry milk, in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Membranes were then incubated with specific primary antibodies (0.5–1 μg/ml) diluted in 5% nonfat dry milk overnight. Following four 5-min washes in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Antigen complexes were visualized on x-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Protein bands were quantified by digital densitometry with a Bio-Rad Fluor-S imager and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For experiments in which whole cell lysate was used (Fig. 2A), GAPDH was used as a loading control. Equal protein loading was done for experiments involving membrane preparations. Heart tissue was harvested from adult rats, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS, and frozen in Tissue-TEK OCT compound (Torrance, CA); and 7–10-μm sections were cut on a cryostat. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (10 min), washed in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min). Isolated cells cultured on laminin-coated coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (5 min), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min). After blocking with 5% normal donkey serum in PBS, heart sections or cells were incubated with specific primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS-T, donkey secondary antibodies conjugated to DyLight-488 or DyLight-549 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added for 60 min to heart sections or isolated cells. Samples were then washed in PBS-T and mounted onto slides using ProLong Gold anti-fade mounting kit (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was analyzed, and images were acquired on an Olympus or Zeiss confocal microscope. High resolution images were converted to 8-bit TIFF files, and then ImageJ software was used to investigate co-localization as discussed previously (12Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Co-localization was determined by measuring Pearson's correlation coefficient. Whole cell patch clamp experiments were carried out at 35–37 °C, and cell-attached patch clamp experiments were done at room temperature. The Axopatch 200B (voltage clamp) and Multiclamp 700B (current clamp) amplifiers (MDS Analytical Technologies) were used for patch clamp experiments. 3–4 megohms (whole cell) and 10–11 megohms (cell attached) patch pipettes used in our experiments were pulled from borosilicate glass using a pipette puller (model P97, Sutter Instruments). The bath solution for whole cell recordings contained (mm) NaCl 148, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 1.0, CaCl2 1.8, NaH2PO4 0.4, glucose 5.5, HEPES 15, pH 7.4 (NaOH). For IK1 measurement, 5 μm nifedipine was added to block Ca2+ current and the Ca2+-sensitive chloride current. BaCl2 (1 mm) was used to isolate IK1 from other background currents. 1 μm isoproterenol was added to the bath solution to activate β-adrenergic receptors (1Dhamoon A.S. Pandit S.V. Sarmast F.

Physiol. 1995; 486: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The pipette filling solution contained (mm) KCl 148, MgCl2 1, EGTA 5, HEPES 5, creatine 2, ATP 5, phosphocreatine 5, pH 7.2 (KOH). The solution for recording single channel unitary events for the bath solution contained (mm) KCl 140, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, NaH2PO4 0.33, pH 7.4 (KOH). The pipette filling solution for recording single channel unitary events contained (mm) KCl 140, CaCl2 1, HEPES 5; pH 7.4 (KOH). Whole cell IK1 was recorded using the step protocol with a holding at −50 mV to inactivate sodium channels and steps from a voltage range of −100 to +20 mV in 10-mV increments with a duration of 500 ms. Nifedipine (5 μm) was used to block the ICa-L (14Dhamoon A.S. Jalife J. Heart Rhythm. 2005; 2: 316-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For single channel unitary current recordings, we used a step protocol with a holding potential at 0 mV and stepped to −120 mV to record single channel events in cell-attached configuration. The bath solution contained 140 mm [K+]o to maintain the cell at 0 mV (15Muñoz V. Vaidyanathan R. Tolkacheva E.G. Dhamoon A.S. Taffet S.M. Anumonwo J.M. Heart Rhythm. 2007; 4: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The pCLAMP10 suite of programs was used to analyze single channel amplitudes and their open and close duration as a function of voltage (16Liu G.X. Zhou J. Nattel S. Koren G. J. Physiol. 2004; 556: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Luu T. Gage P.W. Tierney M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35699-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Single channel current amplitudes were measured directly from and to base line and were only accepted as valid events if their open durations were more than 15 ms (15Muñoz V. Vaidyanathan R. Tolkacheva E.G. Dhamoon A.S. Taffet S.M. Anumonwo J.M. Heart Rhythm. 2007; 4: 487-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An amplitude histogram was then constructed using 300–400 events (bin size = 0.5) and fitted with a Gaussian function to determine the most frequently occurring single channel conductance. Dwell time histograms were plotted similarly and fitted with first order exponential decay functions to calculate the τo and τc. Statistical comparisons were carried out using Student's paired and unpaired t test or analysis of variance using the built-in programs in OriginLab or Microsoft Excel software (Northampton, MA). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. of the mean. Unitary conductance measurements of IK1 in rat ventricular cells are reminiscent of heterologously expressed Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channels, (18Josephson I.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 80: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar, 19Wahler G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1266-C1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting the predominance of these isoforms in this cell type. Therefore, we investigated possible interactions between SAP97 and Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channel proteins in the myocardium. Immunolocalization was performed in both cardiac tissue and isolated cardiac myocytes, results of which are shown in Fig. 1A. SAP97 localizes at both the T-tubules (Fig. 1A, double arrows; panels c4, f2, i4, and l2) and intercalated discs (asterisk; panels c2 and i2). Kir2.1 co-localized with SAP97 at the intercalated discs (Fig. 1A, asterisk; panel c1) and T-tubules (double arrows; panel c3 and f1), although Kir2.2 and SAP97 co-localized only at the T-tubules (double arrows; panels i3 and l1). A population of nonmyocytes was positive for Kir2.2 consistent with the report of Kir2.2 expression in vascular endothelial cells (20Fang Y. Schram G. Romanenko V.G. Shi C. Conti L. Vandenberg C.A. Davies P.F. Nattel S. Levitan I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C1134-C1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This population of myocytes is identified by arrowheads in Fig. 1A, panel i. Quantification of co-localization showed significant overlap between the fluorescent staining patterns and subcellular localization of Kir2.1/Kir2.2 and SAP97. The average Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.83 ± 0.10 (n = 36) for Kir2.1 and SAP97 and 0.94 ± 0.08 (n = 46) for Kir2.2 and SAP97. These results suggest that SAP97 and Kir2.1/Kir2.2 co-localize to the same discrete subcellular regions. Co-IP was used to investigate whether Kir2.x channels and SAP97 associate (directly or indirectly) with each other. Immunoprecipitation of SAP97 pulled down Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 (Fig. 1B). Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 failed to co-immunoprecipitate when a nonimmune antibody was used as a negative control. In the immunoblot for detecting Kir2.1, the membrane input has two bands. The lower band in Fig. 1B is a cross-reacting protein that is seen when this antibody is used on cardiac membrane preparations or tissue homogenate. When antibodies recognizing Kir2.1 or Kir2.2 were used for the immunoprecipitation, SAP97 co-immunoprecipitated with Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 but failed to immunoprecipitate with purified rabbit IgG (negative control) (Fig. 1C). The protein band corresponding to SAP97 in the anti-Kir2.2 antibody immunoprecipitation lane is faint; hence a digitally enhanced image (Fig. 1C, #) is shown below the original blot for clarity. Taken together, these results suggest that Kir2.x channels are in a complex with SAP97 in cardiac myocytes. We used viral transfer technology to knock down the expression of SAP97 in cultured ARVMs. Cells were infected with adenovirus containing shRNA silencing construct for SAP97 (shSAP97) or a control shRNA that has been previously used as a negative control (shCTR) (10Oxford E.M. Musa H. Maass K. Coombs W. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The efficiency of adenoviral infection in cultured myocytes using an adenoviral green fluorescent protein vector at a multiplicity of infection of 5 yielded ∼95% infected cells (supplemental Fig. I). For all our experiments, adenoviral shRNA vectors were used at multiplicity of infection of 100. Fig. 2A (left) is a representative Western blot probed for SAP97 (top) and GAPDH (bottom) on whole cell lysates. The right panel of Fig. 2A is a histogram of averaged results from three preparations. In a separate set of experiments, the mRNA levels of SAP97 relative to GAPDH were also measured using quantitative real time PCR. Comparable with our results with relative protein expression levels of SAP97, mRNA were reduced by ∼60% as compared with shCTR infected control (data not shown) on day 2. The resting membrane potential of SAP97-infected cells was significantly depolarized as compared with control cells (p = 0.00004) as follows: −69.54 ± 0.55 mV (n = 5) and −66.02 ± 0.64 mV (n = 5) in control and SAP97-silenced cells, respectively. Given that our Western blot data showed that SAP97 expression was silenced by day 3, IK1 was recorded on day 3 or 4 in all subsequent experiments. Fig. 2B shows representative traces from uninfected (left, top) and SAP97-silenced (left, bottom) cells. Fig. 2B (right) is the average barium-sensitive IK1 density plot from cells in control and following SAP97 silencing. Silencing of SAP97 decreased IK1 density by ∼55% as compared with controls. The average current density at −100 mV (peak inward) and −60 mV (peak outward) for SAP97-silenced cells, respectively, were −1.45 ± 0.15 pA/pF and 0.14 ± 0.03 pA/pF (n = 6, n = 2). These values were significantly reduced as compared with shCTR (−3.03 ± 0.37 pA/pF and 0.27 ± 0.05 pA/pF (n = 8, n = 2)) (p < 0.0001). The inset in Fig. 2B is a magnification of the current density-voltage (I-V) plot at depolarized voltages (−80 to −40 mV). To investigate if the decrease in IK1 density was due to the silencing of SAP97 and not a result of morphological dedifferentiation and/or changes in cell size and/or down-regulation of ion channels, we investigated these properties in myocytes under our culture conditions in both uninfected and shCTR-infected ARVMs. Our results show that there was no morphological dedifferentiation of ARVM in culture because under our culture conditions ARVMs maintained a rod-shaped morphology for up to 4 days (Fig. 3A) for both uninfected and shCTR-infected cells (21Horackova M. Byczko Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cell capacitance recorded from control (78.15 ± 5.51 pF (n = 16)) and SAP97-silenced (78.77 ± 4.6 pF, n = 27) cells was not significantly different (p = not significant) after 3 days in culture. It has been reported previously that IK1 density may change in culture (22Veldkamp M.W. de Jonge B. van Ginneken A.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility during 5 days of culture, we recorded IK1 density using a step protocol (Fig. 3B, left, top). Representative traces recorded on day 1 and 5 are shown in Fig. 3B, left, middle and bottom panels, respectively. Fig. 3B, right, shows an average barium-sensitive IK1 I-V plot. The peak inward current (−100 mV) on day 1 was −3 ± 0.4 pA/pF (n = 5, n = 2) and was −3 ± 0.4 pA/pF, (n = 5, n = 2) on day 5. The peak outward current (−60 mV) on day 1 was 0.16 ± 0.09 pA/pF (n = 5, n = 2) and was 0.25 ± 0.13 pA/pF (n = 5, n = 2) on day 5. These values were not significantly different (p = not significant). Taken together, the data from Fig. 3 suggest that IK1 density is not altered by our culture conditions. To investigate the possible mechanism(s) for the decrease in whole cell IK1 density, we studied the unitary conductance (γ) properties in cells infected with shCTR or shSAP97 (Fig. 4). Representative cell-attached patch recordings with transitions of ∼44 pS from controls and from SAP97-silenced cells are shown in Fig. 4A (inset). Given conductance variability in each patch, the average number of events at each conductance value was normalized to the total number of events and then plotted against unitary conductance for each condition (shCTR (n = 338, n = 5) and shSAP97 (n = 293, n = 6)) (20Fang Y. Schram G. Romanenko V.G. Shi C. Conti L. Vandenberg C.A. Davies P.F. Nattel S. Levitan I. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 289: C1134-C1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A is a histogram of the average unitary conductance events. A wide range of γ values was observed, with three prominent peaks between 15 and 20-, 20 and 30-, and 30 and 50-pS conductances. Statistical analysis showed that there was no difference between the two conditions. Note that the larger conductances have a broad distribution. Interestingly, there is a peak at ∼18 pS in shCTR and shSAP97 (although more prominent in control), which is reminiscent of the γ of Kir2.3 isoform, and might therefore suggest the presence of this isoform in ARVMs. This issue is further addressed under “Discussion” and in the supplemental material. Fig. 4B depicts single order exponential fits to the mean open (τo) (left) and closed (τc) times (right) of the unitary events. The values of τo and τc were 32 ± 8.0 and 30.1 ± 5.1 ms for control (n = 4 and 2) and 29 ± 2.3 and 22.1 ± 3.1 ms in shSAP97-infected cells (n = 4 and 2), respectively. These τo and τc values were not significantly different between shCTR and shSAP97. Further analysis of the τo and τc for 20–35- and 35–50-pS conductance levels showed that these values were also not significantly different between shCTR- and shSAP97-infected cells. The τo for 20–35- and 35–50-pS conductance levels were 31.07406 ± 2.8 and 26.84 ± 0.93 ms in shCTR-infected cells and 29.51 ± 3.9 and 29.31 ± 1.1 ms in shSAP97-infected cells, respectively. The paucity of transitions in the 10–20-pS range prevented any further analysis of events in this range from shSAP97-infected cells. The τo for the 10–20-pS conductance level under control was 485.20 ± 110.27 ms and is consistent with that shown by others (18Josephson I.R. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 80: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar). If this conductance represents Kir2.3 channels, this would also suggest that Kir2.3 might be more sensitive to regulation"
https://openalex.org/W2009690034,"BEST1 is highly and preferentially expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and causes Best macular dystrophy when mutated. We previously demonstrated that the human BEST1 upstream region −154 to +38 bp is sufficient to direct expression in the RPE of transgenic mice, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and OTX2 regulate this BEST1 promoter. However, a number of questions remained. Here, we show that yeast one-hybrid screen with bait corresponding to BEST1 −120 to −88 bp identified the SOX-E factors, SOX8, SOX9, and SOX10. A paired SOX site was found in this bait, and mutation of either of the paired sites significantly decreased BEST1 promoter activity in RPE primary cultures. Among the SOX-E genes, SOX9 is highly and preferentially expressed in the RPE, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with fresh RPE cells revealed binding of SOX9, but not SOX10, to the BEST1 region where the paired SOX site is located. BEST1 promoter activity was increased by SOX9 overexpression and decreased by siRNA-mediated SOX9 knockdown. Importantly, SOX9 physically interacted with MITF and OTX2 and orchestrated synergistic activation of the BEST1 promoter with the paired SOX site playing essential roles. A combination of the expression patterns of SOX9, MITF, and OTX2 yielded tissue distribution remarkably similar to that of BEST1. Lastly, the BEST1 promoter was also active in Sertoli cells of the testis in transgenic mice where SOX9 is highly expressed. These results define SOX9 as a key regulator of BEST1 expression and demonstrate for the first time its functional role in the RPE.

RPE cells and melanocytes, two major pigmented cells in the body, share pigment-related genes such as tyrosinase (Tyr) and dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) and transcription factors regulating them such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF); otherwise, these two cell types are distinct in many aspects.

SOX9 is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors, which is characterized by the high mobility group domain, a DNA-binding motif of about 79 amino acids that is at least 50% identical to the high mobility group domain of SRY (20Bowles J.

SOX factors can act as architectural proteins that facilitate interaction between widely separated binding sites and promote the assembly of transcriptional complexes (21Harley V.R. Clarkson M.J.

In humans, heterozygous mutations in SOX9 cause campomelic dysplasia (CD), a severe skeletal malformation syndrome frequently associated with XY sex reversal, and the majority of CD patients die during the neonatal period (34Foster J.W.

SOX9 strongly binds as a dimer to a so-called “paired SOX site” that consists of two binding elements in opposite orientation with 3–4 bp spacing but can also bind to a single site as a monomer (39Bell D.M.

To understand the mechanisms regulating gene expression in the RPE, we have been analyzing the 5′-upstream region of BEST1 as a model system (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol.

BEST1 expression was initially found at the high level in the RPE with lower levels in the testis and brain (47Petrukhin K. Koisti M.J. Bakall B. Li W. Xie G. Marknell T. Sandgren O. Forsman K. Holmgren G. Andreasson S. Vujic M. Bergen A.A. McGarty-Dugan V. Figueroa D. Austin C.P. Metzker M.L. Caskey C.T. Wadelius C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar); subsequently, it has also been found in specific cell types, such as airway epithelial cells (48Duta V. Szkotak A.J. Nahirney D.

BEST1 encodes bestrophin-1, a multispan transmembrane protein that seems to function as both a Ca2+-activated chloride channel (50Hartzell H.C. Qu Z. Yu K. Xiao Q. Chien L.T. Physiol.

Mutations of BEST1 cause Best disease (vitelliform macular dystrophy, VMD), an autosomal dominant, juvenile onset macular degeneration that is characterized by accumulation of lipofuscin-like material within and beneath the RPE and an abnormal electrooculogram (47Petrukhin K. Koisti M.J. Bakall B. Li W. Xie G. Marknell T. Sandgren O. Forsman K. Holmgren G. Andreasson S. Vujic M. Bergen A.A. McGarty-Dugan V. Figueroa D. Austin C.P. Metzker M.L. Caskey C.T. Wadelius C. Nat.

However, the phenotypic heterogeneity associated with BEST1 mutations is increasingly complex with an additional four distinct ocular diseases described to date, i.e., adult onset vitelliform macular dystrophy (AVMD) (55Allikmets R.

Furthermore, the mechanism by which mutations of BEST1 cause Best disease has been controversial (50Hartzell H.C. Qu Z. Yu K. Xiao Q. Chien L.T. Physiol.

Although Best disease was originally attributed to a loss of chloride channel activity, recent analyses of knock-in mice carrying the disease-causing mutation W93C in Best1 suggested that Best disease likely results from dysfunction in the regulation of Ca2+ signaling (59Zhang Y. Stanton J.B. Wu J. Yu K. Hartzell H.C. Peachey N.S. Marmorstein L.Y. Marmorstein A.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 1108-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using transgenic mice indicated that the human BEST1 −154 to +38 bp region is sufficient to direct RPE-specific expression in the eye (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using in vivo electroporation, we further showed that the −154 to −104 bp segment contains regulatory elements contributing to a 10-fold increase in promoter activity in mouse RPE (60Kachi S. Esumi N. Zack D.J. Campochiaro P.A. Gene Ther. 2006; 13: 798-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the identification of SOX9 by yeast one-hybrid screen as a factor that binds to this segment and plays a key role in the regulation of BEST1 in the RPE. We show that SOX9 physically interacts with MITF and OTX2 and orchestrates synergistic activation of the BEST1 promoter. Because the function of SOX9 in the RPE has never been recognized before, this is the first demonstration that SOX9 indeed plays a significant role in the regulation of a gene that is important for RPE physiology. We also suggest for the first time that BEST1 is expressed in Sertoli cells of the testis in which SOX9 is highly expressed. A BEST1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct containing the fragment −154 to +38 bp in pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was generated previously (BEST1−154/+38-luciferase) (18Esumi N. Oshima Y. Li Y. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19064-19073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutated BEST1−154/+38-luciferase constructs were made using PCR with synthetic long oligonucleotides containing mutations (underlined) in the paired SOX site, Site A (left, −107 to −101 bp, GACAAGG to GACGCGG, designated mutA), Site B (right, −96 to −90 bp, CTTTGTG to CGGCGTG, mutB), or both (mutAB) (Fig. 1A; also supplemental table). All fragments were ligated into SmaI site of pGL2-Basic and verified by sequencing. BEST1−154/+38-luciferase constructs containing mutation of E-boxes (m1, m2, and m1m2) and mutation of OTX sites (ma, mb, and mamb) were generated and described previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S.

Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2009; 18: 128-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for human MITF-M and OTX2 were also generated previously (17Esumi N.

Expression vectors for human SOX8, SOX9, and SOX10 were constructed using cDNAs generated by RT-PCR from RNAs that were extracted from testis, testis, and brain, respectively, with primer pairs containing restriction sites, an EcoRI site in forward primers and a HindIII site in reverse primers (supplemental table). Then, the cDNA fragments were inserted into EcoRI/HindIII sites downstream of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-) B vector (Invitrogen). A hybrid library of bovine RPE cDNAs fused to the activation domain of yeast transcription factor GAL4 in pGADT7 (Clontech) was constructed previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Three yeast reporter vectors (pHISi, pHISi-1, and pLacZi) were made with a trimer of the BEST1 −120 to −88 bp segment (designated Bait 6) using the Matchmaker One-Hybrid System (Clontech) (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A 123-base sense strand oligonucleotide containing the trimer was entirely synthesized (supplemental table) and converted to double-stranded DNA, and the resultant DNA fragment was subcloned into each vector as described previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Then, yeast strain YM4271 was transformed with these constructs, and a dual reporter strain containing both HIS3 and lacZ constructs was generated (61Chen S. Zack D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 590-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using this dual reporter strain, YOH screen was performed as described previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 61Chen S. Zack D.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 590-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a total of ∼3 × 106 yeast colonies were screened. The yeast dual reporter strain containing Bait 6 was transformed with plasmid DNA purified from positive YOH clones for SOX8, SOX9, and SOX10. As control for bait, a yeast reporter strain containing Bait 11 (irrelevant to this study) was transformed in the same manner. As control for binding factors, plasmid DNA purified from yeast clones for CGGBP1 and GTF2IRD1, which were isolated by YOH screen with Baits 11 and 7, respectively, and empty pGADT7 were used. Growing colonies were streaked directly on nylon membranes on top of selection medium and stained by X-Gal. D407 human RPE and SK-MEL-5 human melanoma cell lines were cultured as described previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1838-1850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pig eyes obtained from a slaughterhouse were disinfected with 95% ethanol and dissected to remove cornea, lens, and retina. RPE/choroid eyecups were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filled with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA up to ⅔ of the eyecups for digestion at 37 °C for 1 h. RPE cells were collected by gentle pipetting, transferred into Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 μg/ml gentamicin, and plated into a 60-mm dish per eye in the same medium. The culture medium was changed the next day (day 1) and day 4. By days 7–8, the cultures became confluent, and then the culture medium was switched to DMEM containing 2% FBS. By 3–4 weeks, the cultures showed a cobblestone-like appearance. For transfection assays, RPE primary cells cultured for 4 weeks were treated with trypsin and seeded in 24-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well in 500 μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the next day transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for siRNA. The transfection efficiency for plasmid DNA checked by a plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was 10–20%. The transfection efficiency for siRNA checked by fluorescein-labeled double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide Block It (Invitrogen) was ∼50%. Transfection studies were carried out utilizing dual luciferase assays as described previously (16Esumi N. Kachi S. Campochiaro P.A. Zack D.J. J. Biol.

As host cells, D407, SK-MEL-5, and pig RPE primary cells were used to analyze basal promoter activity, and D407 cells were used for cotransfection. All plasmid transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus. For simple transfection with D407 and SK-MEL-5, plasmid DNA for each 35-mm dish included 1 μg of firefly luciferase vector and 0.1 ng of pRL-CMV containing Renilla luciferase gene (Promega) as control. For transfection with RPE primary cells, plasmid DNA for each well of 24-well plates included 0.4 μg of firefly luciferase vector and 0.05 ng of pRL-CMV. For cotransfection involving SOX9, because SOX9 activated the CMV promoter in pRL-CMV, pRL-TK containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by the TK promoter (Promega) was used as control. Also, because of high background activation of empty pGL2-Basic by a high dose of SOX9, 0.1 μg of SOX9 expression vector that did not activate pGL2-Basic was used throughout. Accordingly, for cotransfection with SOX9, plasmid DNA for each 35-mm dish included 1 μg of firefly luciferase vector, 0.1 μg of SOX9 expression vector, 0.4 μg of empty pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-) vector, and 5 ng of pRL-TK. For cotransfection with various combinations of transcription factors, 0.1, 0.5, and 0.5 μg of expression vectors were used for SOX9, MITF, and OTX2, respectively, and the total amount of expression vectors was adjusted to 1.5 μg by adding pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−). Accordingly, plasmid DNA for each 35-mm dish included 1 μg of firefly luciferase vector, 1.5 μg of expression vectors, and 5 ng of pRL-TK. As a firefly luciferase vector, BEST1−154/+38-luciferase constructs with wild-type sequence or mutation of the paired SOX site (mutA, mutB, or mutAB), E-boxes (m1, m2, or m1m2) (16Esumi N. Kachi S.

Down-regulation of expression of the transporters for CMP-sialic acid, GDP-fucose, or both unexpectedly resulted in accumulation of glycoconjugates in the Golgi apparatus rather than in the plasma membrane. Pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled sugars and amino acids showed decreased synthesis and secretion of both nonglycoproteins and glycoproteins. Further studies revealed that the above silencing induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and inhibited protein translation initiation. Together these results suggest that global inhibition of Golgi apparatus glycosylation may lead to important secondary metabolic changes, unrelated to glycosylation.

Together these results suggest that global inhibition of Golgi apparatus glycosylation may lead to important secondary metabolic changes, unrelated to glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2033574377,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in growth factor-signaling pathways leading to cell proliferation, but the mechanisms leading to ROS generation and the targets of ROS signals are not well understood. Using a focused siRNA screen to identify redox-related proteins required for growth factor-induced cell cycle entry, we show that two ROS-generating proteins, the NADPH oxidases NOX4 and DUOX2, are required for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation in normal human fibroblasts. Unexpectedly, NOX4 and DUOX2 knockdown did not inhibit the early signaling pathways leading to cyclin D1 upregulation. However, hours after growth factor stimulation, NOX4 and DUOX2 knockdown reduced ERK1 phosphorylation and increased levels of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and a cell cycle inhibitor protein p21 (Waf1/Cip1) that is transcriptionally regulated by p53. Co-knockdown of NOX4 or DUOX2 with either p53 or with p21 overcame the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation that occurred with NOX4 or DUOX2 knockdown alone. Our results argue that rather than primarily affecting growth factor receptor signaling, NOX4 and DUOX2 regulate cell cycle entry as part of a p53-dependent checkpoint for proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2422156966,"Angiogenesis involves a complex set of cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions that coordinately promote and inhibit blood vessel growth and sprouting. Although many factors that promote angiogenesis have been characterized, the identities and mechanisms of action of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis remain unclear. Furthermore, little is known about how cancer cells selectively circumvent the actions of these inhibitors to promote pathological angiogenesis, a requisite event for tumor progression. Using mosaic mouse models of the malignant brain cancer, astrocytoma, we report that tumor cells induce pathological angiogenesis by suppressing expression of the ECM protein receptor alphavbeta8 integrin. Diminished integrin expression in astrocytoma cells leads to reduced activation of latent TGFbetas, resulting in impaired TGFbeta receptor signaling in tumor-associated endothelial cells. These data reveal that astrocytoma cells manipulate their angiogenic balance by selectively suppressing alphavbeta8 integrin expression and function. Finally, these results show that an adhesion and signaling axis normally involved in developmental brain angiogenesis is pathologically exploited in adult brain tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1973345874,"Certain bacteria synthesize glutathionylspermidine (Gsp), from GSH and spermidine. Escherichia coli Gsp synthetase/amidase (GspSA) catalyzes both the synthesis and hydrolysis of Gsp. Prior to the work reported herein, the physiological role(s) of Gsp or how the two opposing GspSA activities are regulated had not been elucidated. We report that Gsp-modified proteins from E. coli contain mixed disulfides of Gsp and protein thiols, representing a new type of post-translational modification formerly undocumented. The level of these proteins is increased by oxidative stress. We attribute the accumulation of such proteins to the selective inactivation of GspSA amidase activity. X-ray crystallography and a chemical modification study indicated that the catalytic cysteine thiol of the GspSA amidase domain is transiently inactivated by H(2)O(2) oxidation to sulfenic acid, which is stabilized by a very short hydrogen bond with a water molecule. We propose a set of reactions that explains how the levels of Gsp and Gsp S-thiolated proteins are modulated in response to oxidative stress. The hypersensitivities of GspSA and GspSA/glutaredoxin null mutants to H(2)O(2) support the idea that GspSA and glutaredoxin act synergistically to regulate the redox environment of E. coli."

Although TF antigen has been known for almost 80 yr as a pancarcinoma antigen, the recognition mechanism between TF antigen and target protein has not been structurally characterized. A number of studies indicated that TF disaccharide is a potential ligand of the galactoside-binding galectins. In this work, we identified the TF antigen as a potential ligand of the antitumor galectin AAL (Agrocybe aegerita lectin) through glycan array analysis and reported the crystal structure of AAL complexed with the TF antigen. The structure provides a first look at the recognition mode between AAL and TF antigen, which is unique in a conservative (Glu-water-Arg-water) structural motif-based hydrogen bond network. Structure-based mutagenesis analysis further revealed the residues responsible for recognition specificity and binding affinity. Crystal structures of AAL complexed with two other TF-containing glycans showed that the unique TF recognition mode is kept intact, which may be commonly adopted in some cancer-related galectins. The finding provided the new target and approach for the antitumor drug design and relative strategy based on the AAL-TF recognition mode as a prototype model.—Feng, L., Sun, H., Zhang, Y., Li, D.-F., Wang, D.-C.

https://openalex.org/W2095179858,"Inactivating mutations in hemojuvelin/repulsive guidance molecule c (HJV/RGMc) cause juvenile hemochromatosis (JH), a rapidly progressive iron overload disorder in which expression of hepcidin, a key liver-derived iron-regulatory hormone, is severely diminished. Several growth factors in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, including BMP2 and BMP6, can stimulate production of hepcidin, a biological effect that may be modified by RGMc. Here we demonstrate that soluble RGMc proteins are potent BMP inhibitors. We find that 50- and 40-kDa RGMc isoforms, when added to cells as highly purified IgG Fc fusion proteins, are able to block the acute effects of both BMP2 and BMP6 at the levels of Smad induction and gene activation, and thus represent a potentially unique class of broad-spectrum BMP antagonists. Whole transcript microarray analysis revealed that BMP2 and BMP6 each stimulated expression of a nearly identical cohort of approximately 40 mRNAs in Hep3B cells and demonstrated that 40-kDa RGMc was an effective inhibitor of both growth factors, although its potency was less than that of the known BMP2-selective antagonist, Noggin. We additionally show that JH-linked RGMc mutant proteins that retain the ability to bind BMPs are also able to function as BMP inhibitors, and like the wild type soluble RGMc species, can block BMP-activated hepcidin gene expression. The latter results raise the question of whether disease severity in JH will vary depending on the ability of a given mutant RGMc protein to interact with BMPs."
https://openalex.org/W2058163419,"Drug resistance-associated mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) can affect the balance between polymerase and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activities of the enzyme. We have recently demonstrated that the N348I mutation in the connection domain causes selective dissociation from RNase H-competent complexes, whereas the functional integrity of the polymerase-competent complex remains largely unaffected. N348I has been associated with resistance to the non-nucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI), nevirapine; however, a possible mechanism that links changes in RNase H activity to changes in NNRTI susceptibility remains to be established. To address this problem, we consider recent findings suggesting that NNRTIs may affect the orientation of RT on its nucleic acid substrate and increase RNase H activity. Here we demonstrate that RNase H-mediated primer removal is indeed more efficient in the presence of NNRTIs; however, the N348I mutant enzyme is able to counteract this effect. Efavirenz, a tight binding inhibitor, restricts the influence of the mutation. These findings provide strong evidence to suggest that N348I can thwart the inhibitory effects of nevirapine during initiation of (+)-strand DNA synthesis, which provides a novel mechanism for resistance. The data are in agreement with clinical data, which demonstrate a stronger effect of N348I on susceptibility to nevirapine as compared with efavirenz."

Recently, molecular dynamics simulations predicted that a sequence located at the interface of subdomains 1 and 3 (W-loop; residues 165–172) changes from an unstructured loop to a β-turn conformation upon ATP hydrolysis (Zheng, X., Diraviyam, K., and Sept, D. (2007) Biophys. J. 93, 1277–1283). This region participates directly in the binding to other subunits in F-actin as well as to cofilin, profilin, and WH2 domain proteins and, therefore, could contribute to the nucleotide sensitivity of these interactions. The present study demonstrates a reciprocal communication between the W-loop region and the nucleotide binding cleft on actin. Point mutagenesis of residues 167, 169, and 170 and their site-specific labeling significantly affect the nucleotide release from the cleft region, whereas the ATP/ADP switch alters the fluorescence of probes located in the W-loop. In the ADP-Pi state, the W-loop adopts a conformation similar to that in the ATP state but different from the ADP state. Binding of latrunculin A to the nucleotide cleft favors the ATP-like conformation of the W-loop, whereas ADP-ribosylation of Arg-177 forces the W-loop into a conformation distinct from those in the ADP and ATP-states.

IntroductionActin, one of the most abundant and conserved eukaryotic proteins, is involved in a variety of cellular functions, from cell division and migration to intracellular transport and endo- and exocytosis. Under physiological conditions, monomeric actin (G-actin) 3The abbreviations used are: G-actinmonomeric actinF-actinfilamentous actinABPactin binding proteinsA167Cactin mutant A167C/C374AF169Cactin mutant F169C/C374AS170Cactin mutant S170C/C374AEMelectron microscopyKabCkabiramide CLatAlatrunculin ASDsubdomainSpvBSalmonella enterica virulence-associated protein BWTwild typeYPDyeast extract/peptone/dextroseCccritical concentration. and filamentous actin (F-actin) are in a dynamic equilibrium, strongly favoring the latter. Very low basal ATPase activity of G-actin is amplified strongly upon its polymerization, and the release of inorganic Pi in general follows the polymerization with some delay (2Korn E.D. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Science. 1987; 238: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 3Carlier M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, under equilibrium conditions, a typical actin filament contains ATP protomers at the growing end followed by an ADP-Pi-enriched region and then by an extended ADP region in the rest of the filament. The nature of the bound nucleotide influences the properties of G- and F-actin and controls their interactions with a number of actin-binding proteins (ABP), which play key regulatory and structural roles in the dynamics and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton. Nucleotide-sensitive ABPs regulate nucleotide exchange rates and the polymerization of G-actin, the nucleation of new filaments, and disassembly of mature filaments. Thus, preferential binding of the Arp2/3 nucleating complex to ATP and ADP-Pi F-actin, cofilin to ADP-F-actin, and profilin to ATP-G-actin leads to the acceleration of directed actin filament treadmilling by orders of magnitude (for a recent review, see Ref. 4Bugyi B. Le Clainche C. Romet-Lemonne G. Carlier M.F. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such selective recognition of ABPs implies that actin undergoes conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis and Pi release; however, the detailed structural basis of such changes is still debated.Molecular events, presumably implicated in the nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions of actin upon ATP hydrolysis, can be classified as global and local depending on the amplitude of the conformational transition. Global conformational changes suggest rotation of entire subdomains, resulting in an open-closed transition of the nucleotide binding cleft (5Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In contrast, local conformational changes are restricted to relatively small regions on the actin molecule (Fig. 1A), such as the direct sensors of ATP hydrolysis the H-loop (residues 70–78) and the S-loop (residues 11–16) (6Graceffa P.

Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Opening of the nucleotide cleft of actin upon ATP hydrolysis and Pi release has been initially suggested through an analogy with other members of the hexokinase family ATPases to which actin belongs (12Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). To date, this cleft opening hypothesis remains to be confirmed. Solution data on the cleft opening has been viewed as inconclusive and open to alternative interpretations (10Kudryashov D.S. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2466-2475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most crystal structures of ADP-actin as well as ATP-actin are in the closed state, with a single exception of the β-actin-profilin complex, which was solved in the open conformation (13Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A recent report utilizing dynamic fluorescence quenching supports the opening and closing of the cleft upon profilin and cofilin binding, respectively (14Kardos R. Pozsonyi K. Nevalainen E. Lappalainen P. Nyitrai M. Hild G. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 2335-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the results of several molecular dynamic simulation studies are inconclusive (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K.

Thus, it appears that additional experiments involving direct measurements of intercleft distance are required to resolve this ambiguity.Recently, nucleotide-dependent conformational changes on actin have been examined by Sept and co-workers (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using multiple, long molecular dynamics simulations. Although the opening of the nucleotide cleft was not observed in this study, several sites on actin were found to respond specifically to the ATP, ADP-Pi, or ADP state of the nucleotide binding cleft (Fig. 1A). First, it has been found that the H-loop, previously denoted as a sensor loop (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), loses most of the hydrogen-bonding networks responsible for the formation of a β-sheet in the ATP and ADP-Pi states and transits to an unstructured coil in the ADP state. Second, in agreement with crystallography studies of Dominguez and co-workers (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the D-loop forms a stable α-helix in the ADP state but adopts a coil conformation in both the ATP and ADP-Pi states. Third, the position of the C-terminal region (residues 349–375; Fig. 1A) differed by 5 Å between the average ATP and ADP states. Finally, it was noted (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the W-loop (residues 165–172) shifted from a coil state in ATP-actin to a classical β-turn conformation in the ADP- and ADP-Pi-actin due to the formation of backbone hydrogen bonds between Tyr-166 and Tyr-169 (Tyr-166 and Phe-169 in yeast; Fig. 1, B and C). The last observation merits special attention for the following reasons; (i) the W-loop is a prime interaction site for the WH2 domain proteins and also participates in the binding of profilin (5Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), cofilin (19Paavilainen V.O. Oksanen E. Goldman A. Lappalainen P. J.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), most of which are known to have different affinities for ATP- and ADP-actin; (ii) the W-loop is a part of the F-actin interface in most filament models published to date (24Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 25Holmes K.C. Angert I. Kull F.J. Jahn W. Schröder R.R.

Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); (iii) in contrast to all other nucleotide-sensitive areas mentioned above, the W-loop has not been tested experimentally for nucleotide-dependent conformational rearrangements on actin and evaded prior scrutiny.In this study we explored the W-loop sensitivity to nucleotide-dependent transitions in actin by site-directed mutagenesis and specific fluorescent labeling of several residues within this loop. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in this region. Future research should examine the interactions of different ABPs with the W-loop region on actin in different nucleotide states.DISCUSSIONNucleotide-dependent conformational changes in actin are a subject of considerable interest. Although ATP hydrolysis per se is not required for actin polymerization (50De La Cruz E.M. Mandinova A. Steinmetz M.O. Stoffler D. Aebi U. Pollard T.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 51Cooke R. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3250-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it defines the properties of actin filaments and provides the energy for their predominant disassembly at the pointed ends and predominant assembly at the barbed ends i.e. the treadmilling of filaments under equilibrium conditions. Many ABPs interact preferentially with the ATP, ADP-Pi, or ADP states of both G- and F-actin. Profilin, thymosin-β4, vitamin D-binding protein, Arp2/3 complex, and WH2 domain proteins have higher affinity to ATP-actin. Other proteins, such as gelsolin and cofilin, bind predominantly to ADP-actin (52Laham L.E. Way M. Yin H.L. Janmey P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 53Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 54Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). However, the detailed nature of conformational rearrangements on actin underlying the ABP binding selectivity is unknown. Many of these proteins bind to actin at the interface between SDs 1 and 3, where the W-loop, a recently predicted nucleotide sensor (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is located.Cysteine replacements in the W-loop affect to a different extent the properties of actin. Surprisingly, the eight-amino acid residues of the W-loop of mammalian actins are identical to those of Schizosaccharomyces pombe actin but share only 50% identity with the corresponding sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin (Fig. 1D). One substitution (E167A) is not conserved, whereas others (Y169F, A170S, L171I) are conserved or semi-conserved. Our attempts to substitute a highly conserved Gly-168 with cysteine failed due to the lethality of this mutant. This suggests strong structural constraints for a residue at this position. Gly-168 is located at the tip of the W-loop and is likely to be critical for the formation of a proper turn. In contrast, the properties of A167C mutant actin were virtually indistinguishable from those of WT actin, at least in terms of their polymerization and nucleotide exchange. The mildness of this phenotype can be justified partly by the relative insignificance of this residue in filament formation and the semi-conserved nature of the substitution (small-to-small residue). However, even a more conserved S170C substitution resulted in a more severe phenotype, with a slower polymerization rate, higher Cc, and, most importantly, a significantly (∼8 times) slower nucleotide exchange rate. This implies that residue 170 is involved in actin polymerization and affects the nucleotide cleft properties of G-actin. Interestingly, residue 170 is Ala in a vast majority of actin isoforms (including S. pombe actin), but it is Ser in S. cerevisiae actin. Analysis of crystal structures of various actins with Protein Interaction Calculator software (55Tina K.G. Bhadra R. Srinivasan N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W473-W476Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) indicates that Ala-170 can be involved in hydrophobic interactions (within 5 Å) with 5–6 other vicinal residues, namely, amino acids 136, 139, 163, 165, 172, and 175. In striking contrast, the polar side chain of Ser-170 in S. cerevisiae actin does not form any contacts (PDB codes 1VYN and 1YAG) with nearby residues. Interestingly, the nucleotide release rate of skeletal actin is about an order of magnitude slower than that of yeast WT actin under identical conditions (0.0011 versus 0.013 s−1), whereas the S170C substitution makes the nucleotide release properties of both actins comparable. Although Cys and Ser are both polar, non-charged residues, Cys has a positive hydropathy index (+2.5 compared with −0.8 for Ser and, in fact, is even higher than that of Ala (56Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16959) Google Scholar)), indicating a higher tendency of Cys to seek hydrophobic environment. The significant difference in nucleotide release rates of the two actin isoforms and the dramatic effect of Cys-170 on this rate prompts the speculation that hydrophobic interactions of Ala (in skeletal actin) or Cys (in S170C yeast actin) residues might restrict the dynamic fluctuations of the W-loop and the nucleotide cleft area, resulting in slower nucleotide release and impaired polymerization properties of this mutant. However, additional molecular simulation and mutagenesis studies are required to test this hypothesis.Although the nucleotide exchange properties of the F169C mutant with a non-conserved F-to-C substitution were affected to a lesser degree (2-fold inhibition compared with WT actin), its polymerization phenotype was more severe. The polymerization impairment due to the F169C substitution is consistent with a model-predicted participation of this residue in the formation of intersubunit contacts in F-actin (24Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 25Holmes K.C. Angert I. Kull F.J. Jahn W. Schröder R.R.

Topf M. Sali A. Matsudaira P. Dougherty M. Chiu W. Schmid M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 375: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, in a recent high resolution model of F-actin, the aromatic ring of Tyr-169 in skeletal actin (corresponding to Phe-169 in yeast actin) makes abundant contacts with several conserved, nonpolar/hydrophobic residues (Val-43, Met-44, and Val-45) in the D-loop of the longitudinally adjacent protomer (26Oda T. Iwasa M. Aihara T. Maéda Y. Narita A. Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Given that both the D-loop and the W-loop are nucleotide-sensitive areas, it is tempting to hypothesize that a putative W-loop/D-loop contact may play a critical role in weakening the SD1–3/SD2 longitudinal contacts upon ATP-hydrolysis and Pi release (58Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yet the high Cc of F169C ADP-actin (∼13 μm compared with ∼4 μm for that of WT and Cys-167 ADP-actins) suggests that the W-loop might participate in the stabilization of filament contacts also in ADP-F-actin.Both Ala-167 and Ser-170 (Glu-167 and Ala-170 in human actins, respectively) also play important roles in filament contact formation, as follows both from the current study and another recent work (59Stokasimov E. McKane M. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34844-34854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, these residues are less conserved, and their role in filament stabilization is more difficult to explain based on the existing filament models. Thus, A167R and A167E mutations have been recently shown to severely impair the polymerization of S. cerevisiae yeast actin (59Stokasimov E. McKane M. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34844-34854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which is quite unexpected given that Glu-167 is present in most other actins (Fig. 1D), including actin from another yeast organism, S. pombe. Therefore, WT-like behavior of the A167C mutant observed in our assays is likely due to a relatively conserved nature of the substitution (Ala-to-Cys) and not the insignificance of this residue to actin polymerization.The addition of phalloidin rescued the polymerization of F169C actin, whereas cofilin failed to significantly improve its polymerization and the structure of the filaments. This contrasts with the behavior of several other actin species with impaired polymerization, namely T203C yeast mutant actin, tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide-modified α-skeletal actin, and enzymatically cross-linked actin oligomers, for which the polymerization can be rescued with cofilin (34Kudryashov D.S. Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Phan M. Egelman E.H. Reisler E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Kudryashov D.S. Durer Z.A. Ytterberg A.J. Sawaya M.R. Pashkov I. Prochazkova K. Yeates T.O. Loo R.R. Loo J.A. Satchell K.J. Reisler E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18537-18542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cofilin rescues actin polymerization by bridging neighboring subunits and changing the actin-actin interface (34Kudryashov D.S. Galkin V.E. Orlova A. Phan M. Egelman E.H. Reisler E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It follows from the failure of cofilin to improve the F169C filaments that a bulky ring of the Tyr/Phe-169 residue may be involved in filament contacts both in the cofilin-free and cofilin-decorated F-actin.Nucleotide Effects on the Properties of the W-loopFluorescent probes attached to any of the tested W-loop cysteine mutants responded to different extents to the substitution of ATP with ADP at the nucleotide cleft. The most responsive mutant was F169C, and the most sensitive probe for this mutant was pyrene maleimide. Pyrene fluorescence increases reversibly with the transition of G-actin to the ADP-state. Molecular dynamics simulations performed by Zheng et al. (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) showed that the W-loop forms a β-turn in the ADP and ADP-Pi states and adopts a loop conformation in the ATP-state, i.e. the ADP- and ADP-Pi states of the W-loop are similar to each other, but different from the ATP state. Yet numerous studies indicate that the properties of F-actin in ATP and ADP-Pi states are similar to each other but differ from those of ADP-F-actin (for review, see Ref. 60Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). The latter is in agreement with our experiments on G-actin, indicating that the W-loop properties are indeed similar in the ATP and ADP-Pi actin but different in the ADP-actin. In support of that, the addition of inorganic phosphate to F169C-pyrene actin caused no significant changes in the fluorescence of ATP-actin but brought the fluorescence of ADP-actin close to that of ATP-actin (Fig. 6). Several factors may potentially account for the apparent discrepancy between the molecular dynamic simulation data and our results, including isoform specificity (α-skeletal actin in Zheng et al. (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) versus S. cerevisiae actin in the present study), the effect of mutation, and/or labeling. An alternative explanation could be that the observed W-loop properties are defined by the side chain rather than the backbone. Indeed, in the molecular dynamic simulation study (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the Tyr-169 side chain occupies a similar position in ATP and ADP-Pi states but swings out significantly in the ADP-state (Fig. 1C).Pi titration of ADP-actin in the presence of KabC did not influence fluorescence intensity, indicating that the strong local effects of KabC overcome the allosteric effects of Pi. This is not surprising as KabC makes direct contacts with residues 168 and 169. The Pi affinity to F169C-G-actin was estimated at ∼13 mm, which is about 2.5–7 times stronger than measured previously for skeletal α-actin (∼30–90 mm (61Fujiwara I. Vavylonis D. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 8827-8832Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although we do not have a direct explanation for this discrepancy, it may stem from the difference between actin isoforms or the labeling of the W-loop with pyrene maleimide.Effects of Drugs and ModificationsLatA is a marine drug that binds to G-actin in the nucleotide binding cleft region and blocks filament formation most likely by interfering with specific conformational changes necessary for polymerization (62Morton W.M. Ayscough K.R. McLaughlin P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Although LatA does not affect the fluorescence of the probe in the ATP-state of F169C-pyrene actin, it quenches efficiently the fluorescence of ADP-actin to the level of ATP-actin (Fig. 5A). Therefore, our data suggest that LatA forces the W-loop of actin to the ATP-like conformation. This is not unexpected, because LatA binds with higher affinity to ATP-actin (Ref. 40Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar and our data) and apparently stabilizes that conformation. Our result correlates with the observations that the binding of LatA to actin is affected by profilin and cofilin, proteins that interact with actin in the cleft between SD1 and -3, at a significant distance from the LatA binding site. Binding of LatA to actin is allosterically inhibited by cofilin (63Bernstein B.W. Chen H. Boyle J.A. Bamburg J.R. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C828-C839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (which has higher affinity for ADP-actin) but improved slightly by profilin (has higher affinity for ATP-actin) (40Yarmola E.G. Somasundaram T. Boring T.A. Spector I. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28120-28127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Future studies should clarify whether the W-loop is involved in the regulation of nucleotide sensitive interactions of actin with these and other proteins.Although it is not clear to date how conformational changes are transmitted from the nucleotide cleft region to the W-loop, our data support a view that Arg-177 might be involved in this process. In the primary sequence of actin, Arg-177 is the closest residue to the W-loop that is known to be directly implicated in the regulation of nucleotide cleft properties. Thus, Arg-177 is one of the key residues in the backdoor mechanism of Pi release upon hydrolysis (47Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found that ADP-ribosylation of Arg-177 by SpvB changes the environment of pyrene at Cys-169. This modification both increases the fluorescence signal in the ATP state of actin and inverses the changes caused by a transition from the ATP to ADP state. Therefore, ADP-ribosylation does not block, but modifies the conformational signal transmitted from the nucleotide binding cleft to the W-loop.Comparison of S. cerevisiae and Mammalian ActinsThe W-loop region of S. cerevisiae actin has a lower level of conservation than most other actins (Fig. 1D). This raises a potential concern that the observed nucleotide sensitivity can be attributed to the yeast actin but not be a universal property of all actins. However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is unlikely to be the case. First, the nucleotide sensitive hydrogen bond is formed between a fairly conserved Tyr-166-Tyr/Phe-169 pair of residues. Second, three antiparallel β-strands connecting the W-loop with the nucleotide binding region (Fig. 1A) are also well conserved among different actin species. Third, the nucleotide sensitivity of the W-loop was predicted initially based on the molecular dynamics simulation of skeletal actin (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) but has been confirmed now for yeast actin, suggesting its conservation across species. Finally, the nucleotide-dependent regulation of actin polymerization as well as actin interaction with several key ABPs is highly conserved through evolution, and therefore, the underlying allosteric interconnections on actin should be also conserved.In conclusion, we demonstrate experimentally that the W-loop of actin (residues 165–172) undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational changes and, thus, together with the C terminus and the DNase binding loop, is a nucleotide sensitive region on actin. Given the importance of this and the surrounding sites of actin to protein-protein interactions (64Dominguez R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 572-578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and to the formation of F-actin interface, the W-loop region is a prime candidate for contributing to the nucleotide sensitivity of these interactions. IntroductionActin, one of the most abundant and conserved eukaryotic proteins, is involved in a variety of cellular functions, from cell division and migration to intracellular transport and endo- and exocytosis. Under physiological conditions, monomeric actin (G-actin) 3The abbreviations used are: G-actinmonomeric actinF-actinfilamentous actinABPactin binding proteinsA167Cactin mutant A167C/C374AF169Cactin mutant F169C/C374AS170Cactin mutant S170C/C374AEMelectron microscopyKabCkabiramide CLatAlatrunculin ASDsubdomainSpvBSalmonella enterica virulence-associated protein BWTwild typeYPDyeast extract/peptone/dextroseCccritical concentration. and filamentous actin (F-actin) are in a dynamic equilibrium, strongly favoring the latter. Very low basal ATPase activity of G-actin is amplified strongly upon its polymerization, and the release of inorganic Pi in general follows the polymerization with some delay (2Korn E.D. Carlier M.F. Pantaloni D. Science. 1987; 238: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 3Carlier M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Consequently, under equilibrium conditions, a typical actin filament contains ATP protomers at the growing end followed by an ADP-Pi-enriched region and then by an extended ADP region in the rest of the filament. The nature of the bound nucleotide influences the properties of G- and F-actin and controls their interactions with a number of actin-binding proteins (ABP), which play key regulatory and structural roles in the dynamics and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton. Nucleotide-sensitive ABPs regulate nucleotide exchange rates and the polymerization of G-actin, the nucleation of new filaments, and disassembly of mature filaments. Thus, preferential binding of the Arp2/3 nucleating complex to ATP and ADP-Pi F-actin, cofilin to ADP-F-actin, and profilin to ATP-G-actin leads to the acceleration of directed actin filament treadmilling by orders of magnitude (for a recent review, see Ref. 4Bugyi B. Le Clainche C. Romet-Lemonne G. Carlier M.F. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such selective recognition of ABPs implies that actin undergoes conformational changes upon ATP hydrolysis and Pi release; however, the detailed structural basis of such changes is still debated.Molecular events, presumably implicated in the nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions of actin upon ATP hydrolysis, can be classified as global and local depending on the amplitude of the conformational transition. Global conformational changes suggest rotation of entire subdomains, resulting in an open-closed transition of the nucleotide binding cleft (5Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In contrast, local conformational changes are restricted to relatively small regions on the actin molecule (Fig. 1A), such as the direct sensors of ATP hydrolysis the H-loop (residues 70–78) and the S-loop (residues 11–16) (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R.

Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1957-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Kudryashov D.S. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2466-2475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the DNase I binding loop (D-loop) (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Strzelecka-Gołaszewska H. Moraczewska J. Khaitlina S.Y. Mossakowska M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Opening of the nucleotide cleft of actin upon ATP hydrolysis and Pi release has been initially suggested through an analogy with other members of the hexokinase family ATPases to which actin belongs (12Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7290-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). To date, this cleft opening hypothesis remains to be confirmed. Solution data on the cleft opening has been viewed as inconclusive and open to alternative interpretations (10Kudryashov D.S. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 2466-2475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most crystal structures of ADP-actin as well as ATP-actin are in the closed state, with a single exception of the β-actin-profilin complex, which was solved in the open conformation (13Chik J.K. Lindberg U. Schutt C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A recent report utilizing dynamic fluorescence quenching supports the opening and closing of the cleft upon profilin and cofilin binding, respectively (14Kardos R. Pozsonyi K. Nevalainen E. Lappalainen P. Nyitrai M. Hild G. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 2335-2343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the results of several molecular dynamic simulation studies are inconclusive (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Pfaendtner J. Branduardi D. Parrinello M. Pollard T.D. Voth G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, it appears that additional experiments involving direct measurements of intercleft distance are required to resolve this ambiguity.Recently, nucleotide-dependent conformational changes on actin have been examined by Sept and co-workers (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using multiple, long molecular dynamics simulations. Although the opening of the nucleotide cleft was not observed in this study, several sites on actin were found to respond specifically to the ATP, ADP-Pi, or ADP state of the nucleotide binding cleft (Fig. 1A). First, it has been found that the H-loop, previously denoted as a sensor loop (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), loses most of the hydrogen-bonding networks responsible for the formation of a β-sheet in the ATP and ADP-Pi states and transits to an unstructured coil in the ADP state. Second, in agreement with crystallography studies of Dominguez and co-workers (6Graceffa P. Dominguez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34172-34180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 7Otterbein L.R. Graceffa P. Dominguez R. Science. 2001; 293: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that the D-loop forms a stable α-helix in the ADP state but adopts a coil conformation in both the ATP and ADP-Pi states. Third, the position of the C-terminal region (residues 349–375; Fig. 1A) differed by 5 Å between the average ATP and ADP states. Finally, it was noted (1Zheng X. Diraviyam K. Sept D. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1277-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that the W-loop (residues 165–172) shifted from a coil state in ATP-actin to a classical β-turn conformation in the ADP- and ADP-Pi-actin due to the formation of backbone hydrogen bonds between Tyr-166 and Tyr-169 (Tyr-166 and Phe-169 in yeast; Fig. 1, B and C). The last observation merits special attention for the following reasons; (i) the W-loop is a prime interaction site for the WH2 domain proteins and also participates in the binding of profilin (5Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), cofilin (19Paavilainen V.O. Oksanen E. Goldman A. Lappalainen P. J.

EMBO J. 2008; 27: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), most of which are known to have different affinities for ATP- and ADP-actin; (ii) the W-loop is a part of the F-actin interface in most filament models published to date (24Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 25Holmes K.C. Angert I. Kull F.J. Jahn W. Schröder R.R.

Nature. 2009; 457: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); (iii) in contrast to all other nucleotide-sensitive areas mentioned above, the W-loop has not been tested experimentally for nucleotide-dependent conformational rearrangements on actin and evaded prior scrutiny.In this study we explored the W-loop sensitivity to nucleotide-dependent transitions in actin by site-directed mutagenesis and specific fluorescent labeling of several residues within this loop. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in this region. Future research should examine the interactions of different ABPs with the W-loop region on actin in different nucleotide states."

In the search of new insights into the functions of β-dystrobrevin, the isoform restricted to non-muscle tissues, we performed a two-hybrid screen of a mouse cDNA library to look for interacting proteins. Among the positive clones, one encodes iBRAF/HMG20a, a high mobility group (HMG)-domain protein that activates REST (RE-1 silencing transcription factor)-responsive genes, playing a key role in the initiation of neuronal differentiation. We characterized the β-dystrobrevin-iBRAF interaction by in vitro and in vivo association assays, localized the binding region of one protein to the other, and assessed the kinetics of the interaction as one of high affinity. We also found that β-dystrobrevin directly binds to BRAF35/HMG20b, a close homologue of iBRAF and a member of a co-repressor complex required for the repression of neural specific genes in neuronal progenitors. In vitro assays indicated that β-dystrobrevin binds to RE-1 and represses the promoter activity of synapsin I, a REST-responsive gene that is a marker for neuronal differentiation.

Mice lacking α-dystrobrevin have a mild form of muscular dystrophy, which does not impair the DPC assembly (13Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas mice lacking β-dystrobrevin appear to be phenotypically normal, although alterations of dystrophin Dp71 and syntrophin isoforms at the basal membranes of kidney and liver can be observed (14Loh N.Y. Nebenius-Oosthuizen D. Blake D.J. Smith A.J. Davies K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7442-7448Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, double knock-out mice lacking both α- and β-dystrobrevin reveal a decrease in the size and number of γ-aminobutyric acid receptor clusters at cerebellar inhibitory synapses, loss of dystrophin from these sites, and sensorimotor behaviors that reflect perturbations in cerebellar function (15Grady R.M. Wozniak D.F. Ohlemiller K.K. Sanes J.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Dystrobrevin double knock-out mice, therefore, provided evidence that DPC components other than dystrophin affect synaptic structure in the brain, suggesting that motor deficits in dystrophic patients may reflect not only peripheral derangements but also central nervous system defects (15Grady R.M. Wozniak D.F. Ohlemiller K.K. Sanes J.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2841-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The role of dystrobrevins remains elusive, although their cellular functions are beginning to be elucidated through the study of their associated proteins. Several dystrobrevin-associated proteins have recently been described, including dysbindin (16Benson M.A. Newey S.E. Martin-Rendon E. Hawkes R. Blake D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), kinesin (17Macioce P. Gambara G. Bernassola M. Gaddini L. Torreri P. Macchia G. Ramoni C.

Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Among these, pancortin has been proposed to support neuronal differentiation and survival (22Nagano T. Nakamura A. Konno D. Kurata M. Yagi H. Sato M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and dysbindin has been indicated as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene (23Benson M.A. Sillitoe R.V. Blake D.J. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 516-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that dystrobrevin might be involved in cognitive defects and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we characterized the association of β-dystrobrevin with a novel binding partner, the high mobility group (HMG) protein iBRAF/HMG20a, and found that β-dystrobrevin also interacts with the close homologue of iBRAF, BRAF35/HMG20b. HMG proteins are ubiquitous non-histone proteins that bind to DNA and chromatin, acting as architectural elements that modulate chromatin structure, and control the expression of a number of genes (24Bianchi M.E. Agresti A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 496-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). We also report that β-dystrobrevin binds to and represses the promoter of synapsin I, a neuronal differentiation gene. Our results corroborate the role of dystrobrevin as a multifunctional scaffold protein and suggest that in neurons it might be involved in differentiation processes as a component of co-activator/co-repressor complexes required for the regulation of neural-specific genes. A goat HMG20a polyclonal antibody (Everest Biotech) was used to detect iBRAF/HMG20a. A dystrobrevin monoclonal antibody (Clone 23, BD Transduction Laboratories) or a polyclonal antibody raised against β-dystrobrevin (17Macioce P. Gambara G. Bernassola M. Gaddini L. Torreri P. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) were used to detect dystrobrevins. Additional antibodies used were GATA-4 (H-112) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Myc tag (Clontech), and BRAF35 (4.21) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies. Construction of pGEX-6P/β-DB, pGBKT7/β-DB, pGADT7/β-DB, and pCMV-HA/β-DB is described in detail elsewhere (17Macioce P. Gambara G. Bernassola M. Gaddini L. Torreri P. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as is construction of pCRII-TOPO/α-DB1 (18Ceccarini M. Torreri P. Lombardi D.G. Macchia G. Macioce P. Petrucci T.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), pCRII-TOPO/β-DB1–352, and pCRII-TOPO/β-DB357–615 (21Veroni C. Grasso M. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 2631-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and of pCMV-Myc/β-DB (20Ceccarini M. Grasso M. Veroni C. Gambara G. Artegiani B. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Torreri P. Mallozzi C. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1174-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). pEGFP-C2/β-DB, pGEX-6P/β-DB1–352, and pGEX-6P/β-DB357–615 were obtained by EcoRI digestion of pGBKT7/β-DB, pCRII-TOPO/β-DB1–352, and pCRII-TOPO/β-DB357–615, respectively, and insertion of the corresponding insert into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) and pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA insert coding for the iBRAF carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 233–342) and the upstream hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was amplified by PCR from the pACT2-iBRAF template and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO and into pEXP5-NT-TOPO (Invitrogen) to create pCRII-TOPO/iBRAF233–342 and pEXP5-NT-TOPO/iBRAF233–342, respectively. The whole coding region of iBRAF was obtained by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed RNA isolated from mouse brain using specific primers that annealed at the 5′ and 3′ regions overlapping the start and stop codon, respectively. The 1.0-kb full-length iBRAF sequence was then cloned into pCRII-TOPO and pEXP5-NT-TOPO vectors to obtain pCRII-TOPO/iBRAF and pEXP5-NT-TOPO/iBRAF, respectively. Full-length iBRAF was then amplified by PCR from pCRIITOPO/iBRAF with a 5′ artificial XhoI site and a 3′ artificial HindIII site and subcloned into the XhoI-HindIII sites of pDsRed-Monomer-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) to produce pDsRed-C1/iBRAF. pCMV-HA/iBRAF and pCMV-Myc/iBRAF were obtained by XhoI-KpnI digestion of pDsRed-C1/iBRAF and insertion of the iBRAF fragment into the XhoI-KpnI of pCMV-HA and pCMV-Myc vectors (BD Biosciences Clontech). The full-length coding region of BRAF35 was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain into pCRII-TOPO vector to obtain pCRII-TOPO/BRAF35. After EcoRI digestion, the BRAF35 fragment was inserted into the EcoRI site of pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to create pGEX-6P/BRAF35. Full-length human Dp71 cDNA, obtained as reported previously (25Ceccarini M. Rizzo G. Rosa G. Chelucci C. Macioce P. Petrucci T.C. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 103: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), was subcloned into pCRII-TOPO to produce pCRII-TOPO/Dp71. A 466-bp DNA fragment of the human synapsin I promoter (from −422 to + 44) containing the RE-1 sequence was amplified by PCR from pSyCAT-10 (26Jüngling S. Cibelli G. Czardybon M. Gerdes H.H. Thiel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Russo K. Di Stasio E. Macchia G. Rosa G. Brancaccio A. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with a 5′ artificial XhoI site and a 3′ artificial NotI site, and subcloned into pCRII-TOPO to create pCRII-TOPO/SYN. A 520-bp fragment obtained after XhoI digestion of pCRII-TOPO/SYN was then inserted into the XhoI site upstream of the luciferase gene of the pGL3-Promoter vector (pGL3-Prom; Promega) to obtain pGL3-Prom/SYN. All constructs were checked by sequence analysis. TNT SP6 or T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) in the presence of PRO-MIX (70% l-[35S]methionine; 30% l-[35S]cysteine; Amersham Biosciences) was used to transcribe and translate in vitro pCRII-TOPO/iBRAF and pCRII-TOPO/iBRAF233–342 to obtain 35S-labeled full-length iBRAF and the amino-terminal truncated mutant iBRAF233–342, respectively. The same procedure was followed for pCRII-TOPO/β-DB and deletion mutants pCRII-TOPO/α-DB1 and pCRII-TOPO/Dp71 to obtain the corresponding polypeptides. Newly synthesized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with an Instant-Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). β-Dystrobrevin full-length and deletion mutants as well as BRAF35 were obtained as recombinant GST-fused proteins from the corresponding constructs in pGEX-6P and used to perform GST pulldown as previously described using 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors as binding buffer (20Ceccarini M. Grasso M. Veroni C. Gambara G. Artegiani B. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Torreri P. Mallozzi C. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1174-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-iBRAF and His6-iBRAF233–342 were obtained from pEXP5-NT-TOPO/iBRAF and pEXP5-NT-TOPO/iBRAF233–342, respectively. For His6 pulldown, amino-terminal polyhistidine (His6)-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3-pLysS (His6-iBRAF) and BL21-DE3 (His6-iBRAF233–342) cells, respectively, and purified by affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. His6 fusion proteins bound to Ni-NTA-agarose beads were equilibrated in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors). For binding assays, 5–20 μl of in vitro translated reaction products were incubated with 10–20 μl of 50% slurry bead-bound His6 fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. After extensive washes with binding buffer, bound radioactive proteins were re-suspended in Laemmli loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was performed using a BIAcoreX instrument (BIAcore Intl. AB) equipped with two flow-cell sensor chips, basically as described previously (20Ceccarini M. Grasso M. Veroni C. Gambara G. Artegiani B. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Torreri P. Mallozzi C. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1174-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The interaction of His6-iBRAF and His6-BRAF35 with β-dystrobrevin was studied with a dextran matrix CM5 sensor chip at 25 °C. Immobilization of the proteins was achieved by covalently coupling the proteins to CM5 sensor chips after activation of the carboxymethylated dextran surface by a mixture of 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-3-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride. The reaction was performed by injecting His6-iBRAF or His6-BRAF35 in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.8 or 5.2, respectively, and then blocking the residual activated groups with 1 m ethanolamine-HCl, pH 8.5. The reference cell surface was subjected to the same procedure without the protein. Experiments were performed in HBS-EP (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Full-length β-dystrobrevin, obtained by digestion with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) (18Ceccarini M. Torreri P. Lombardi D.G. Macchia G. Macioce P. Petrucci T.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), was applied in triplicate injections of each concentration. β-Dystrobrevin-truncated mutants, obtained as above, were applied by injections at the concentration of 2 μm, always in triplicate. The amount of protein bound to the sensor chip was monitored by changes in the refractive index, given in arbitrary response units (RU) as a function of time (sensorgram). At the end of the sample plug, HBS-EP buffer was passed over the sensor surface for 4 min to allow dissociation. The sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 5-μl pulse of 50 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 30 μl/min and running buffer until the initial RU level was regained. Injecting β-dystrobrevin samples at the same concentration at the beginning and at the end of a set of experiments resulted in the same RU value, indicating that the ligand was not altered by the chip regeneration process. SPR data were analyzed using the Langmuir model for 1:1 binding and the BIAevaluation software Version 4.1 as described (18Ceccarini M. Torreri P. Lombardi D.G. Macchia G. Macioce P. Petrucci T.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 872-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant koff was evaluated from curves obtained at the saturation of β-dystrobrevin and used to calculate the association rate constant kon and the dissociation constant (Kd = koff/kon). Alternatively, the Kd was evaluated using BIAevaluation 4.1 software to simultaneously fit sensorgrams. Human pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cells NTera-2, clone Dl (NTera-2), were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose formulation) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 in air, humidified atmosphere. NTera-2 cells were maintained in their undifferentiated phenotype by continuous growth at high cell density (5–50 × 106 cells/175 cm2 flask), and differentiation was induced by seeding cells at 2 × 106 cells per 175-cm2 flasks in 10−6m retinoic acid (Sigma) as described (28Cianetti L. Di Cristofaro A. Zappavigna V. Bottero L. Boccoli G. Testa U. Russo G. Boncinelli E. Peschle C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4361-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). P19 cells were grown in α-modified minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 7.5% heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (Invitrogen) and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and split 20 times every other day using 0.05% trypsin-0.02% EDTA as previously described (29Ceccarini M. Macioce P. Panetta B. Petrucci T.C. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2002; 12: 36-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HeLa and COS-7 cells were grown and maintained (5% CO2, 37 °C) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells seeded on sterile, untreated glass coverslips were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature and incubated for 10 min with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 3342 to stain nuclei. Cells were then mounted with VectaShield (Vector Laboratories), and green (enhanced green fluorescent protein), red (DsRed), and blue (Hoechst) fluorescence signals were examined under a Leica TCS 4D confocal microscope. Image acquisition and processing were performed using the SCANware and Multicolor Analysis (Leica Lasertechnik Gmbh) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems) software programs. Tissue from rat brain was homogenized as described elsewhere (20Ceccarini M. Grasso M. Veroni C. Gambara G. Artegiani B. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Torreri P. Mallozzi C. Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1174-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the His6 pulldown assays, 1 mg of proteins from rat brain lysate in 0.7 ml of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors) was cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was then incubated for 2 h with 5 μl of 50% slurry bead-bound His6-iBRAF, and the beads were washed 6 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. Ni-NTA-agarose beads were used as control. After washing, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the β-dystrobrevin polyclonal antibody. For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 3 mg of proteins from rat brain lysate in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was preincubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) (50% slurry) to minimize nonspecific binding. After centrifugation, 1.25 μg of dystrobrevin monoclonal antibody was added to the lysate, and the sample was rotated at 4 °C overnight. 30 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose gel were then added, and incubation was continued for 2h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 6 times with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline-Tween (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors). After washing, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the HMG20a polyclonal antibody or with the polyclonal β-dystrobrevin antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation studies on COS-7 cells were performed essentially as follows. Briefly, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-Myc/iBRAF or pCMV-HA/iBRAF and lysed in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitors. 0.4 ml of precleared lysates (1 mg/ml) was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the c-Myc monoclonal antibody or HA-tag polyclonal antibody (Clontech) and immunoprecipitated using 30 μl of recombinant protein G-agarose. After extensive washing, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were then probed with the goat polyclonal HMG20a antibody and the rabbit polyclonal β-dystrobrevin antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized by using the ECL system (Pierce). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously reported (30Labbaye C. Quaranta M.T. Pagliuca A. Militi S. Licht J.D. Testa U. Peschle C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6669-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Each binding reaction (20 μl) contained 10 μg of NTera-2 cells nuclear extracts after 4 days of retinoic acid treatment in a buffer, pH 7.5, of 20 mm ZnCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, poly(dI/dC), and bovine serum albumin (500 ng per sample), 10% glycerol, and a 30,000 cpm/sample 32P-labeled double-strand oligonucleotide probe encompassing the 21-bp synapsin RE-1 element (RE-1syn*) 5′-CAGCTTCAGCACCGCGGACAGTGCCTTC-3′ (from −237 to −210 bp from the first nucleotide in the proximal synapsin I promoter sequence) (31Schoch S. Cibelli G. Thiel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3317-3323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). After 45 min on ice, the protein-DNA complexes were resolved in a 5% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. A 50-, 100-, 300-, 600-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe (RE-1SYN) or unlabeled mutated oligonucleotide probe (RE-1Mut) 5′-CAGCGTCGGTAGCCCTGGCTGAGCGTTC-3′ was used for competition experiments. 3 μg of the β-dystrobrevin polyclonal antibody or the GATA-4 polyclonal antibody as a negative control were used for supershift assay. In luciferase assays COS-7 cells were co-transfected with pGL3-Prom/SYN and pRL-TK control plasmid (Promega) containing the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter linked to the Renilla luciferase gene in a ratio of 10:1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Where indicated, pCMV-myc/Empty, pCMV-myc/iBRAF, or pCMV-myc/β-DB were also transfected. The empty pGL3-Promoter vector (pGL3-Prom; Promega), which contains the SV40 promoter upstream of firefly luciferase gene but lacks enhancer elements, was used as an internal standard for promoter activity. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter System (Promega) and the Microlite TLX1 luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories) and normalized for Renilla luciferase activity. Data are presented as the mean values ± S.E. obtained from at least three independents experiments. We previously described a two-hybrid mating screen performed to identify proteins that interact with β-dystrobrevin (β-DB) in the brain (17Macioce P. Gambara G. Bernassola M. Gaddini L. Torreri P. Macchia G. Ramoni C. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4847-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). End sequencing and BLAST searching of positive clones revealed that one of them contained the coding sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 233–342) of iBRAF/HMG20a (GenBankTM accession no. ABA26278), an HMG protein with close sequence and structural homology to BRAF35/HMG20b, a member of the BRAF35-HDAC complex that has a key role in the repression of neural specific genes in neuronal progenitors (32Ballas N. Mandel G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2005; 15: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In contrast to BRAF35, iBRAF expression leads to the initiation of neuronal differentiation (33Wynder C. Hakimi M.A. Epstein J.A. Shilatifard A. Shiekhattar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the iBRAF233–342/β-dystrobrevin interaction in the yeast system by mating MATa strain AH109 transformed with pACT2/iBRAF233–342 with MATα strain Y187 transformed with pGBKT7/β-DB. iBRAF233–342 interacts with β-dystrobrevin but not with the unrelated protein lamin C, nor does it transactivate reporter gene expression (data not shown). We tested recombinant GST-β-dystrobrevin for interaction with 35S-labeled carboxyl-terminal iBRAF233–342 (Fig. 1A). Pulldown experiments confirmed that a binding site for β-dystrobrevin lies on the iBRAF carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1B), as indicated by the two-hybrid system results. iBRAF full-length recombinant protein was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and subsequent subcloning into the appropriate vector. The direct interaction between iBRAF and β-dystrobrevin was confirmed by pulldown experiments performed with either full-length His6-iBRAF and in vitro transcribed/translated β-dystrobrevin (Fig. 2A, left) or GST-β-dystrobrevin and in vitro-transcribed/translated iBRAF (Fig. 2A, right).

https://openalex.org/W2075056041,"Background Trans-splicing strategies for mRNA repair involve engineered transcripts designed to anneal target mRNAs in order to interfere with their natural splicing, giving rise to mRNA chimeras where endogenous mutated exons have been replaced by exogenous replacement sequences. A number of trans-splicing molecules have already been proposed for replacing either the 5′ or the 3′ part of transcripts to be repaired. Here, we show the feasibility of RNA surgery by using a double trans-splicing approach allowing the specific substitution of a given mutated exon. Methodology/Principal Findings As a target we used a minigene encoding a fragment of the mdx dystrophin gene enclosing the mutated exon (exon 23). This minigene was cotransfected with a variety of exon exchange constructions, differing in their annealing domains. We obtained accurate and efficient replacement of exon 23 in the mRNA target. Adding up a downstream intronic splice enhancer DISE in the exon exchange molecule enhanced drastically its efficiency up to 25–45% of repair depending on the construction in use. Conclusions/Significance These results demonstrate the possibility to fix up mutated exons, refurbish deleted exons and introduce protein motifs, while keeping natural untranslated sequences, which are essential for mRNA stability and translation regulation. Conversely to the well-known exon skipping, exon exchange has the advantage to be compatible with almost any type of mutations and more generally to a wide range of genetic conditions. In particular, it allows addressing disorders caused by dominant mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2002934448,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway plays important roles in regulating cell motility. TSC2, a downstream target of AKT, is a central player in negatively controlling cell proliferation and protein translation through suppressing the activity of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). However, the function of TSC2 in regulating cell migration remains unclear. Here, we show that TSC2 plays a critical role in the control of cell spreading, polarity, and migration. TSC2-deficient fibroblast cells were impaired in their ability to spread and alter actin cytoskeleton upon stimulation with insulin-like growth factor-1. Using scratch-induced polarization assay, we demonstrate that TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells polarized poorly toward the wound compared with wild-type cells. Similarly, knockdown of TSC2 expression in colon cancer cells resulted in a marked decrease in cell motility. Functionally, the activation of CDC42- and RAC1-GTPase was largely reduced in TSC2 knock-out fibroblast and TSC2 knockdown cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of an activating p110alpha mutant or short term rapamycin treatment rescued the cell polarization defect in TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells. Concurrently, the activation of CDC42 and RAC1 increased. The defect in cell migration and CDC42 and RAC1 activation was reversed by reintroducing TSC2 back into TSC2((-/-)) fibroblast cells. Taken together, we identified a novel role of TSC2 in controlling cell polarity and migration by regulating CDC42 and RAC1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2031492742,"The genetic background of a patient determines in part if a person develops a mild form of malaria and recovers, or develops a severe form and dies. We have used a mouse model to detect genes involved in the resistance or susceptibility to Plasmodium berghei malaria infection. To this end we first characterized 32 different mouse strains infected with P. berghei and identified survival as the best trait to discriminate between the strains. We found a locus on chromosome 6 by linking the survival phenotypes of the mouse strains to their genetic variations using genome wide analyses such as haplotype associated mapping and the efficient mixed-model for association. This new locus involved in malaria resistance contains only two genes and confirms the importance of Ppar-γ in malaria infection."
https://openalex.org/W2005849875,"HLA class-I expression is weak in embryonic stem cells but increases rapidly during lineage progression. It is unknown whether all three classical HLA class-I antigens follow the same developmental program. In the present study, we investigated allele-specific expression of HLA-A, -B, and -C at the mRNA and protein levels on human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow and adipose tissue as well as striated muscle satellite cells and lymphocytes. Using multicolour flow cytometry, we found high cell surface expression of HLA-A on all stem cells and PBMC examined. Surprisingly, HLA-B was either undetectable or very weakly expressed on all stem cells protecting them from complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) using relevant human anti-B and anti-Cw sera. IFNγ stimulation for 48–72 h was required to induce full HLA–B protein expression. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that IFNγ induced a 9–42 fold increase of all six HLA-A,-B,-C gene transcripts. Interestingly, prior to stimulation, gene transcripts for all but two alleles were present in similar amounts suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the constitutive expression of HLA-A,-B, and -C. Locus-restricted expression of HLA-A, -B and -C challenges our current understanding of the function of these molecules as regulators of CD8+ T-cell and NK-cell function and should lead to further inquiries into their expression on other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1963598789,"The mechanism by which an apparently uniform population of cells can generate a heterogeneous population of differentiated derivatives is a fundamental aspect of pluripotent and multipotent stem cell behaviour. One possibility is that the environment and the differentiation cues to which the cells are exposed are not uniform. An alternative, but not mutually exclusive possibility is that the observed heterogeneity arises from the stem cells themselves through the existence of different interconvertible substates that pre-exist before the cells commit to differentiate. We have tested this hypothesis in the case of apparently homogeneous pluripotent human embryonal carcinoma (EC) stem cells, which do not follow a uniform pattern of differentiation when exposed to retinoic acid. Instead, they produce differentiated progeny that include both neuronal and non-neural phenotypes. Our results suggest that pluripotent NTERA2 stem cells oscillate between functionally distinct substates that are primed to select distinct lineages when differentiation is induced."

https://openalex.org/W2053869689,"Rac1, which is associated with cytoskeletal pathways, can activate phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2) to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. This increased Ca2+ can in turn activate the very robust PLCδ1 to synergize Ca2+ signals. We have previously found that PLCβ2 will bind to and inhibit PLCδ1 in solution by an unknown mechanism and that PLCβ2·PLCδ1 complexes can be disrupted by Gβγ subunits. However, because the major populations of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 are cytosolic, their regulation by Gβγ subunits is not clear. Here, we have found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 are the regions that result in PLCδ1 binding and inhibition. In cells, PLCβ2·PLCδ1 form complexes as seen by Förster resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, and microinjection of PHβ2 dissociates the complex. Using PHβ2 as a tool to assess the contribution of PLCβ inhibition of PLCδ1 to Ca2+ release, we found that, although PHβ2 only results in a 25% inhibition of PLCδ1 in solution, in cells the presence of PHβ2 appears to eliminates Ca2+ release suggesting a large threshold effect. We found that the small plasma membrane population of PLCβ2·PLCδ1 is disrupted by activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, and that the major cytosolic population of the complexes are disrupted by Rac1 activation. Thus, the activity of PLCδ1 is controlled by the amount of bound PLCβ2 that changes with displacement of the enzyme by heterotrimeric or small G proteins. Through PLCβ2, PLCδ1 activation is linked to surface receptors as well as signals that mediate cytoskeletal pathways. Rac1, which is associated with cytoskeletal pathways, can activate phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2) to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels. This increased Ca2+ can in turn activate the very robust PLCδ1 to synergize Ca2+ signals.

There are now nine known types of mammalian PLCs that vary in their tissue distribution and their cellular regulation (for review see Refs. 1Suh P.G. Park J.I. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Peak J.C. Katan M.

Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Most PLCs have established protein regulators, and many appear to have multiple mechanisms of regulation that, in principle, may connect different signaling pathways. It is possible that, under some circumstances, different PLC isozymes coordinate to elicit a specific cellular response. As described below, we have recently found that PLCβ and PLCδ couple to synergize Ca2+ responses by surface receptors. phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate pleckstrin homology 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin enhanced cyan fluorescent protein enhanced yellow fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatidylinositol Förster resonance energy transfer. The PLCβ family is activated by heterotrimeric G proteins, which respond to extracellular agonists such as hormones and neurotransmitters through transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (see Ref. 3Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). All four known PLCβ (β1–4) are strongly activated by Gαq, and PLCβ2–3 are also activated by Gβγ subunits. Additionally, PLCβ2 is activated by members of the Rho family of small G proteins; most strongly by Rac1 (for review see Ref. 4Harden T.K. Sondek J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 26: 355-379Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Rac1 is activated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway to initiate events leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements (5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3731) Google Scholar, 6Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although PLCβ has well characterized protein regulators, protein regulators of PLCδ are less established. Unlike other PLC families, PLCδ enzymes are inactive at basal calcium concentrations but become active upon the rise in intracellular Ca2+ brought about by the activity of other PLCs. Two of the three reported PLCδ regulators, RhoA and transglutaminase, lower the amount of Ca2+ required for activation (7Homma Y. Emori Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 286-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 8Im M.J. Russell M.A. Feng J.F. Cell. Signal. 1997; 9: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory discovered a third PLCδ regulator, PLCβ2 and -β3 (9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1438-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These enzymes were found to bind to PLCδ1 and inhibit its activity. Association between PLCβ2–3 and PLCδ1 can be disrupted by the addition of Gβγ subunits in solution, and preliminary studies in cultured cells suggest that the same association may occur in cells. These results suggested a model in which, upon release of Gβγ subunits after stimulation, PLCβ becomes activated by Gβγ subunits, and concomitantly activates PLCδ through a combination of increased level of Ca2+ and loss of inhibition by PLCβ2 and -β3. To better understand the linkage between PLCδ and cell surface receptors, we have found that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCβ2 and -β3 is responsible for binding and inhibition of PLCδ1 and have used this as a reagent to study the importance of PLCβ inhibition of PLCδ1 in cells. We first found that a significant population of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 associate in cells. Stimulation by carbachol reduces the association of the plasma membrane-localized population, whereas microinjection of activated Rac1 reduces the association in the cytosolic population. Microinjection of the PH domain of PLCβ2 (PHβ2) resulted in a decrease in FRET between PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 suggesting that the interaction between these two proteins in cells is achieved through the PH domain. Moreover, microinjection of PHβ2 resulted in a greatly reduced Ca2+ release after stimulation with carbachol suggesting that the extent of a Ca2+ response is directly related to the level of unbound PLCδ1. These studies link PLCδ1 regulation to surface receptors and cytoskeletal movement through PLCβ2. His6-PLCβ2 was expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus system with minor modifications (see Ref. 10Ghosh M. Wang H. Kelley G.G. Smrcka A.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 55-64PubMed Google Scholar for details about the expression and purification). His6 proteins PLCδ1, PHβ2, PHβ3, ΔPH-PLC1, and Rac1 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a Ni2+ column using previously reported methods (see Refs. 9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J.

Expression and purity was assessed by Western blot analysis using commercial antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals, and by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. PHβ2 C18S was prepared by the Molecular Cloning Facility at Stony Brook University. PLC activity was assessed by measuring the hydrolysis of [3H]PI(4,5)P2 dispersed on sonicated phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylethanolamine:PI(4,5)P2 (2:1:0.5, v/v) membranes as described previously (15Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Note that the assays are carried out at a total lipid concentration of 2 mm giving a large excess of PI(4,5)P2 substrate as compared with the nanomolar amount of protein. For the inhibition studies, we used the protein concentrations above the dissociation constant. Protein association was measured by labeling one of the proteins by the addition of a 4:1 probe:protein molar ratio of the thiol-reactive probe 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) in the absence of reducing agents (for details see Ref. 16Drin G. Douguet D. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5712-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After labeling, a small amount of protein ranging in concentration from 1 to 20 nm was placed in a microcuvette and reconstituted on large unilamellar vesicles composed of PI(4,5)P2, palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidyl-serine prepared by extrusion through a 100-Å membrane according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Avanti Biochemicals, Alabaster, AL). Protein association was assessed by plotting the increase in integrated intensity of CPM as the second protein was incrementally added and fitting the curve to a biomolecular association (see Ref. 17Philip F. Scarlata S. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : pl5Google Scholar). Measurements were taken on an ISS PC1 spectrofluorometer using λ(ex) = 360 nm and scanning the fluorescence emission from λ(em) = 390–590 nm. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For fluorescence studies, HEK293 cells were transfected with eYFP-PLCβ2 and eCFP-PLCδ1 vectors or eGFP-PLCδ1 vector (5–10 μg/106 cells in 60-mm dish) by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1438-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein expression of endogenous PLCδ1 was knocked down using small interference RNA PLCδ1 (Dharmacon Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions along with the negative control purchased from the manufacturer. Western blot analysis showed this procedure produces ∼80% knock down. HEK293 cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml apoprotein, 6 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. 200 μg of soluble protein was incubated with 2 μl of PLCδ1 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After addition of 20 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads, the mixture was gently rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Precipitated proteins were loaded onto 8% polyacrylamide gel. For purified protein co-immunoprecipitation instead of cell lysate the same amount PLCβ3 and PLCδ1 was added. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, protein were detected by immunoblotting with anti-PLCβ3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody. 24 h after transfection, cells from 60-mm dishes were plated onto glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek). Images of fluorescent cells were collected 48–72 h after transfection on an Olympus Fluoview1000 confocal microscope equipped with a 40 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Analysis of the FRET images was performed using standard routine incorporated into software provided for the Olympus microscope. The FRET analysis used in this report differs slightly from our previous analysis (e.g. Refs. 18Dowal L. Provitera P. Scarlata S. J. Biol.

Transfected cells were grown in MatTek dishes for 48 h to achieve 50–60% confluence. Prior to microinjecting, the medium was changed to phenol-free Leibovitz L-15 medium. PHβ2 (50 nm) was microinjected with solution containing 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and trace amounts of the red dye Cy5 (Invitrogen). The control solution did not contain PHβ2. Prior to microinjections, PHβ2 S18C was labeled with Alexa546, which served as a acceptor for GFP-PLCδ1. Rac1 was activated using the procedure described in a previous study (13Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Kinsella B.T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23575-23582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2, for 3 × 15 min at 4 °C, and then incubated with reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Lubrol, and 1 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction buffer was used as the control solution for microinjections. Microinjections were performed on an Axiovert 200M from Zeiss using InjectMan NI2 with a FemtoJet pump from Eppendorf. Samples were microinjected into cytoplasm. We typically set the injection pressure Pi = 30 hPa and kept the compensation pressure (Pc) at 15 hPa. The injection time (t) was 0.4 s. Typically, we injected ∼10–25 cells within a 10- to 20-min period. We examined the microinjected cells under the phase microscope (Axiovert 200M from Zeiss with a 40× phase 2 objective) to select viable cells. Cells were then transferred to the Olympus Fluoview1000 for viewing, which was carried out within 2 h after microinjection. For single cell Ca2+ measurements, cells were labeled with 1 μm Calcium Orange or Calcium Green (Invitrogen) for 45 min at room temperature, washed 3 times with Leibovitz L-15 medium, kept at room temperature in the dark without dye for 30 min, and then washed again three times with Leibovitz L-15 medium. The additional washes are required to remove dye that is nonspecifically bound to the plasma membrane. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Calcium Green was excited at 488 nm with an argon ion laser, Calcium Orange was excited with a 543 nm HeNe laser line, and the emission spectrum was recorded using a long pass 560 nm filter. Images were analyzed using Zeiss software. Images were collected every 20 s over a 5-min period. Data were analyzed by comparing the change in intensity of a selected cell or group of cells over the time period. This selection insures that dark pixels are not considered. Usually, five or six cells or cell groups were selected in each experiment. Before studying the regulation of PLCδ1 by PLCβ2 in cells, we set out to identify the region of PLCβ2 that is responsible for PLCδ1 inhibition with the goal of developing a reagent to inhibit association of the enzymes. Mammalian PLCs have a modular structure that are generally composed of an N-terminal PH domain followed by two EF hands, a catalytic domain, and a C2 domain (Fig. 1A). PLCβ enzymes have a distinct C-terminal region that is required for activation by Gαq subunits (see Refs. 2Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 20Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Several years ago, Nagano and coworkers demonstrated that the PH domain of an inactive variant of PLCδ4 could inhibit PLCδ4 activity (21Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T. Watanabe Y. Ozaki C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2872-2879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wondered whether the PH domain of PLCβ2 could be involved in PLCδ1 inhibition. Additionally, we have found that Gβγ, which makes a primary binding contact with the PH domain of PLCβ2 (11Wang T. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1517-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), disrupts PLCβ2·PLCδ1 association, also suggesting that association may occur through this region. We measured the ability of the PH domains of PLCβ2 and -β3 to inhibit PLCδ1 and its isolated catalytic domain (Table 1). To compare the PH domains to the full-length enzymes, we inactivated PLCβ2 and PLCβ3 by covalently modifying the catalytic His residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate as in previous studies (9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1438-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Activity measurements were carried out at high PI(4,5)P2 levels to avoid competition between the two PLCs for substrate. Similar to our earlier work (9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1438-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), we found that the full-length PLCβ enzymes are able to inhibit PLCδ by 40% (e.g.Fig. 1B). A similar inhibition was observed when we substituted the catalytic domain of PLCδ for the full-length enzyme. These data suggest that PLCδ inhibition is caused by contacts between PLCβ2 and the catalytic domain of PLCδ1 but not other PLCδ1 domains.TABLE 1Binding and inhibition of PLCδ1 proteins by PLCβ proteinsProteinsApparent KdInhibitionnm%PLCβ2/PLCδ111.3 ± 2.1, n = 842 ± 4, n = 3PLCβ2/ΔPH-PLCδ116.8 ± 2.2, n = 329 ± 1, n = 6PHβ2/PLCδ11.7 ± 0.8, n = 325 ± 4, n = 9PHβ2/ΔPH-PLCδ111.1 ± 4.0, n = 30PLCβ3/PLCδ11.5 ± 0.3, n = 546 ± 5, n = 6PLCβ3/ΔPH-PLCδ16.0 ± 1.8, n = 328 ± 3, n = 3PHβ3/PLCδ19.4 ± 2.1, n = 334 ± 4, n = 3PHβ3/ΔPH-PLCδ16.4 ± 1.6, n = 50PHβ2/PHδ1No bindingPHβ3/PHδ1No binding Open table in a new tab We then measured the inhibition of PLCδ1 by the PH domains of PLCβ2 and -β3. Although the amount of PLCδ1 inhibition by the PH domains was reduced as compared with the full-length enzyme (i.e. 25–30% see Table 1), it was still significant. We note that, unlike the full-length enzyme, the PH domains were unable to inhibit the isolated catalytic domain of PLCδ1. These results fit well with the idea that the PH domain of PLCδ1 plays an active role in regulating catalysis (see “Discussion”). To determine whether differences in PLCδ1 inhibition by full-length PLCβ2/β3 and its PH domains are due to differences in their binding strength, we measured the affinity of the enzymes and their constructs using fluorescence spectroscopy. Specifically, we labeled one of the protein constructs with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore, CPM, and measured the changes in its fluorescence as the unlabeled binding partner was incrementally added (see Ref. 17Philip F. Scarlata S. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : pl5Google Scholar). An example of a titration is shown in Fig. 1C, and the results are tabulated in Table 1. We found that the PH domains of PHβs and PHδ did not appear to interact while the other constructs all showed a strong and similar affinity whose apparent dissociation constants (Kd) ranged from 1.5 to 15 nm. The similarities in affinities suggest that binding occurs between the PH domains of PLCβ2/3 and the catalytic domain of PLCδ1. We note that, in general, PLCβ3 and its PH domain bound to PLCδ1 and ΔPH-PLCδ1 with a slightly stronger affinity than PLCβ2. The structure of a large portion of PLCβ2, including the PH and catalytic domains, bound to activated Rac1 has been solved (22Jezyk M.R. Snyder J.T. Gershberg S. Worthylake D.K. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1135-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This structure shows that Rac1 associates with the PH domain of PLCβ2. Thus, if PLCβ2 associates with PLCδ1 through its PH domain, then addition of Rac1 would be expected to disrupt that association. We measured the binding between PLCβ2 and PLCδ1, and between PHβ2 and PLCδ1 in the absence and presence of Rac1(GDP) and Rac1(GTPγS). We found that, even in the deactivated form, Rac1 inhibited association between the enzymes (Fig. 2left). In a separate study, we added Dabcyl-Cl-labeled PLCδ1 to a solution of CPM·PLCβ2. Dabcyl is a non-fluorescent FRET acceptor, and a loss in CPM fluorescence has been observed due to transfer of CPM emission to this non-fluorescent probe (see Ref. 17Philip F. Scarlata S. Sci. STKE 2006. 2006; : pl5Google Scholar). We added Dab-PLCδ1 to CPM·PLCβ2 at a concentration so that 50% of the proteins were associated. We then measured the ability of deactivated and activated Rac1 to disrupt the PLCβ2·PLCδ1 complex. We found that activated Rac1 was better able to dissociate the two PLCs (Fig. 2, right). These results support the idea that the PH domain of PLCβ2 is responsible for interaction with PLCδ1. We studied the association between PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 in HEK293 cells by co-transfecting the cells with fluorescence-tagged chimers. It has been previously shown that GFP tags on the C terminus of PLCδ1 do not affect its cellular localization (22Jezyk M.R. Snyder J.T. Gershberg S. Worthylake D.K. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 1135-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In Fig. 3A we compare the localization of untagged and eYFP-tagged PLCβ2 expressed in HEK293 cells where the untagged protein was detected by immunofluorescence. We also present images of endogenous PLCβ2, which is expressed at low levels in these cells. These results suggest that the eYFP tag does not affect cellular localization of PLCβ2. Western blot analysis of untagged and eYFP-PLCβ2 from the soluble and membrane fractions of HEK293 cells gave identical results (data not shown). Expression of eCFP-PLCδ1 in HEK293 cells showed the enzyme to be widely dispersed with a distinct plasma membrane localization as well as populations in the cytosol and nucleus (Fig. 3, top). This distribution has been previously observed (23Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Stallings J.D. Tall E.G. Pentyala S. Rebecchi M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22060-22069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar to previous reports (23Tall E.G. Spector I. Pentyala S.N. Bitter I. Rebecchi M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 743-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), stimulation of the cells with carbachol caused translocation of a population of the enzyme to edges of the cell. In contrast, eYFP-PLCβ2 was almost entirely cytosolic without a distinct plasma membrane component and no nuclear localization (Fig. 3, bottom). Unlike PLCδ1, stimulation of the cells with carbachol did not significantly change localization of overexpressed or endogenous PLCβ2 (Fig. 3, top and middle panels). We have previously found that PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 associate in cells using biomolecular fluorescence complementation (see Ref. 9Guo Y. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1438-1447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this method, two portions of eYFP are attached to potential protein partners, and association of these partners reconstitutes the eYFP generating a fluorescent signal. However, this method only detects associated proteins, and non-associated proteins are optically silent. Therefore, we used FRET, which detects the fluorescence of the individual proteins as well as the amount of energy transfer from the associated species (25van der Meer W. Coker G. Chen S.S.-Y. Resonance Energy Transfer, Theory and Data. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). This method allows us to identify regions of the cell where both the unassociated and associated enzymes are localized. We transfected HEK293 cells with eYFP-PLCβ2 and CFP-PLCδ1, viewed the localization of the fluorescent proteins, and measured the degree of FRET in the localized areas (Fig. 4A), where all of the FRET data presented are corrected for bleedthrough and the small amount of photobleaching (<5%) that is sometimes observed (see “Materials and Methods”). Keeping in mind that the eYFP label is on the N terminus of PLCβ2 and the eCFP label is on the C terminus of PLCδ1, and that association is through the PHβ2, then a crude estimate of the distance between the two probes is <∼100 Å when the enzymes are associated. The Ro, or the distance in which 50% of light is lost to FRET, is ∼50 Å for this pair of fluorophores (26Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of FRET observed should be directly related to the physical association between the two enzymes. Using a positive control where eCFP and eYFP are attached through a dodecapeptide flexible linker, and a negative control consisting of free eCFP and free eYFP, we found that ∼20% of the enzymes in the cytosol were associated as estimated by FRET (Fig. 4C). We supported this result by co-immunoprecipitation studies of endogenous PLCδ1 and PLCβ3, which is expressed at a higher level than PLCβ2 in these cells allowing for more accurate detection (Fig. 4B). These studies support the idea that PLCβ and PLCδ associate in cells. We determined whether stimulation would affect the association of the two enzymes. We first monitored the amount of FRET between eYFP-PLCβ2 and CFP-PLCδ1 when we activated muscarinic acid receptors by the addition of carbachol. Although carbachol stimulation did not significantly change the amount of FRET in the cytosol, we found that it reduced the amount of FRET from the small plasma membrane fraction in a time-dependent manner supporting the observation that released Gβγ subunits can dissociate the complexes (Fig. 5). We interpret the residual FRET as due to the inability to generate enough Gβγ subunits to completely disrupt the complexes. We then tested whether another activator of PLCβ2, the small GTPase, Rac1, disrupts the association between the two PLCs. To this end, we monitored the amount of FRET between eYFP-PLCβ2 and CFP-PLCδ1 when activated Rac1 was microinjected into the cells. We identified microinjected cells by including trace amounts of the red dye Cy5, which will not interfere with the absorption or fluorescence of the eCFP or eYFP probes, into the microinjection solution (Fig. 6, top). We found that microinjection of activated Rac1 abolishes FRET between the two PLCs (Fig. 6, bottom). Identical studies that substitute buffer or deactivated Rac1 did not affect the FRET (Fig. 6, bottom). Because we found that PHβ2 is the main region of interaction between PLCβ2 and PLCδ1, we used this domain as a reagent to determine whether the associated enzymes in the cytosol contribute to Ca2+ release with carbachol stimulation. To carry out these studies, we introduced a Cys residue into PHβ2 (C18A) on an external site, which allowed us to specifically label the domain with Alexa546. We then monitored FRET from GFP-PLCδ1 donors to microinjected Alexa546-PHβ acceptors (Fig. 7). As with the full-length proteins, FRET was localized in the cytosol (Fig. 7A). The FRET value obtained for this combination is within error of the value seen for the full-length proteins supporting the idea that a significant fraction of PLCβ2 and PLCδ1 are associated (Fig. 7B). Because PHβ2 binds to PLCδ1 and inhibits its activity, we tested whether this association could quench Ca2+ signals generated with carbachol stimulation. We microinjected"
https://openalex.org/W2005912896,"Membranous compartments of neurons such as axons, dendrites and modified primary cilia are defining features of neuronal phenotype. This is unlike organelles deep to the plasma membrane, which are for the most part generic and not related directly to morphological, neurochemical or functional specializations. However, here we use multi-label immunohistochemistry combined with confocal and electron microscopy to identify a very large (approximately 6 microns in diameter), entirely intracellular neuronal organelle which occurs singly in a ubiquitous but neurochemically distinct and morphologically simple subset of sympathetic ganglion neurons. Although usually toroidal, it also occurs as twists or rods depending on its intracellular position: tori are most often perinuclear whereas rods are often found in axons. These 'loukoumasomes' (doughnut-like bodies) bind a monoclonal antibody raised against beta-III-tubulin (SDL.3D10), although their inability to bind other beta-III-tubulin monoclonal antibodies indicate that the responsible antigen is not known. Position-morphology relationships within neurons and their expression of non-muscle heavy chain myosin suggest a dynamic structure. They associate with nematosomes, enigmatic nucleolus-like organelles present in many neural and non-neural tissues, which we now show to be composed of filamentous actin. Loukoumasomes also separately interact with mother centrioles forming the basal body of primary cilia. They express gamma tubulin, a microtubule nucleator which localizes to non-neuronal centrosomes, and cenexin, a mother centriole-associated protein required for ciliogenesis. These data reveal a hitherto undescribed organelle, and depict it as an intracellular transport machine, shuttling material between the primary cilium, the nematosome, and the axon."
https://openalex.org/W1972176817,"Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of the myocardium causes discrete sites of injury. RF scars can expand, altering the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure and the continuity of the electrical syncytium of the adjacent myocardium. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, contribute to ECM remodeling. However, whether and to what degree transcriptional induction of MMP-9 occurs after myocardial RF injury and the association with electrical conduction patterns after RF injury remains unexplored. This study examined MMP-9 gene promoter (M9PROM) activation after myocardial RF injury using mice in which the M9PROM was fused to a β-galactosidase (β-gal) reporter. RF lesions (0.5-mm probe, 80°C, 30 s) were created on the left ventricular (LV) epicardium of M9PROM mice (n=62) and terminally studied at 1 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 28 d after RF injury. M9PROM activation was localized through β-gal staining. The RF scar area and the area of β-gal staining were measured and normalized to LV area (planimetry). RF scar size increased from 1 h post-RF-injury values by 7 d and remained higher at 28 d. M9PROM activation became evident at 3 d and peaked at 7 d. Electrical conduction was measured (potentiometric dye mapping) at 7 d after RF injury. Heterogeneities in action potentials and electrical impulse propagation coincident with M9PROM activation were observed after RF injury. For example, conduction proximal to the RF site was slower than that in the remote myocardium (0.15±0.02 vs. 0.83±0.08 mm/ms, P<0.05). Thus, a unique spatiotemporal pattern of MMP-9 transcriptional activation occurred after discrete myocardial injury, which was associated with the development of electrical heterogeneity. Therefore, these findings suggest that changes in a key determinant of extracellular matrix remodeling, in addition to changes in myocardial structure, can contribute to arrhythmogenesis around the region of myocardial injury."
https://openalex.org/W2076864126,"We have used limited trypsin digestion and reactivity with PEG-maleimides (MPEG) to study Ca2+-induced conformational changes of IP3Rs in their native membrane environment. We found that Ca2+ decreased the formation of the 95-kDa C-terminal tryptic fragment when detected by an Ab directed at a C-terminal epitope (CT-1) but not with an Ab recognizing a protected intraluminal epitope. This suggests that Ca2+ induces a conformational change in the IP3R that allows trypsin to cleave the C-terminal epitope. Half-maximal effects of Ca2+ were observed at ∼0.5 μm and was sensitive to inhibition by IP3. Ca2+ also stimulated the reaction of MPEG-5 with an endogenous thiol in the 95-kDa fragment. This effect was eliminated when six closely spaced cysteine residues proximal to the transmembrane domains were mutated (C2000S, C2008S, C2010S, C2043S, C2047S, and C2053S) or when the N-terminal suppressor domain (amino acids 1–225) was deleted. A cysteine substitution mutant introduced at the C-terminal residue (A2749C) was freely accessible to MPEG-5 or MPEG-20 in the absence of Ca2+. However, cysteine substitution mutants in the interior of the tail were poorly reactive with MPEG-5, although reactivity was enhanced by Ca2+. We conclude the following: a) that large conformational changes induced by Ca2+ can be detected in IP3Rs in situ; b) these changes may be driven by Ca2+ binding to the N-terminal suppressor domain and expose a group of closely spaced endogenous thiols in the channel domain; and c) that the C-terminal cytosol-exposed tail of the IP3R may be relatively inaccessible to regulatory proteins unless Ca2+ is present.

All three isoforms consist of an IP3 binding domain in the N-terminal region, a channel domain containing six transmembrane segments in the C-terminal region and an intervening regulatory domain. Apart from IP3, the principal regulator of the channel is Ca2+, which exerts a biphasic effect on channel function with activation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. The structural organization of this complex protein and the mechanism by which binding of IP3 and Ca2+ are linked to channel gating are active areas of investigation.An important feature of the mechanism of the channel involves conformational changes in the protein. In particular, the gating mechanism is thought to involve conformational changes initiated by IP3 binding that are propagated to various regions of the channel domain (6Uchida K. Miyauchi H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The IP3 binding domain of the receptor is organized into a “core” segment that binds IP3 with high affinity (amino acids 226–604) and a “suppressor domain” that inhibits IP3 binding to the core (amino acids 1–225). Crystal structures for the suppressor domain and the IP3-liganded core domain have been obtained (8Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T.

Biophysical measurements using fusion proteins encoding the ligand binding domain have suggested that IP3 favors the formation of compact conformations, whereas Ca2+ promotes the formation of more extended structures (10Chan J.

Conformational changes promoted by Ca2+ have been observed in electron microscopy analysis of detergent purified IP3Rs from mouse cerebellum. In this system, Ca2+ transforms receptors from a square to a windmill shape (14Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

The relationship of the conformational changes detected in fusion proteins or isolated purified receptors to the conformational dynamics of full-length receptors embedded in native membranes remains to be established.In the present study, we have utilized two indirect biochemical approaches to measure the Ca2+-induced conformational changes in native IP3Rs in situ. Our experiments are focused on the 95kDa C-terminal trypsin fragment containing the channel domain and the cytosol-exposed C-terminal tail. The results provide insights into the structural changes of the receptor and suggest that accessibility of critical regions of the receptor to regulatory proteins also could be altered by Ca2+-induced conformational changes.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have used indirect biochemical approaches to observe conformational changes in full-length IP3Rs in their native membrane environment. To do this, we measured changes in accessibility of the protein to trypsin and changes of MPEG reactivity with endogenous and mutant thiols. The experiments focused on the 95-kDa C-terminal trypsin fragment containing the channel domain and C-terminal tail. The results reveal large changes in accessibility induced by Ca2+ in this segment of the receptor. It is possible that this reflects direct effects of Ca2+ on the conformation of the 95-kDa fragment. However, large conformation transitions in the density corresponding to the channel domain were not observed previously in EM studies (15Hamada K. Terauchi A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52881-52889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hence, we favor the view that the changes in accessibility arise indirectly because of Ca2+-induced conformational changes occurring elsewhere in the protein. The structural and physiological implications of the results are discussed below.Although homology models of the channel domain have been constructed (31Schug Z.T. da Fonseca P.C. Bhanumathy C.D.

However, several groups have obtained low resolution structures of purified IP3Rs from electron microscopy studies (32da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although there are considerable differences in these reports, particularly in the assignment of the density corresponding to the ligand binding domain, all the structures visualized are ∼200Å3 and show overall 4-fold symmetry. The receptor has been described variously as resembling a flower (32da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A model consistent with our observations is shown in Fig. 7 and is based on the EM structure reported by da Fonseca et al. (32da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The model shows the presence of a small vestibule/space on the cytosolic side between the channel domain (Fig. 7, shown in blue) and the rest of the receptor, which is narrow at the center of the receptor (∼15 Å) and widens at the periphery (∼30 Å) (32da Fonseca P.C.

A similarly located cavity also has been noted in the other EM models (33Sato C. Hamada K. Ogura T. Miyazawa A. Iwasaki K. Hiroaki Y. Tani K. Terauchi A. Fujiyoshi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21319-21322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We suggest that in the presence of Ca2+, a large conformational transition of the receptor widens this space sufficiently to allow MPEG-5 (hydrated diameter of ∼50 Å (35Howorka S. Movileanu L. Lu X. Magnon M. Cheley S. Braha O. Bayley H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 2411-2416Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) to access a cluster of reactive cysteines located in this compartment. The reactivity of more than one cysteine is inferred from mutagenesis experiments, which indicate that a group of six closely spaced cysteines must be mutated to remove the MPEG-5 reactivity. The available space around the reactive cysteines must be relatively restricted because no reactivity is observed with the much larger MPEG-20 (hydrated diameter of ∼130 Å (36Lin J.K. Ladisch M.R. Patterson J.A. Noller C.H. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1987; 22: 976-981Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). In Fig. 7, the Ca2+-dependent conformational transition is shown as a large outward movement of the densities that have been assigned to the regulatory domain of the receptor (Fig. 7, shown in gray) (32da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-induced change could be the basis of the previously documented “square” to “windmill” conformational transition seen in EM studies of the purified cerebellar IP3 receptor (15Hamada K. Terauchi A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52881-52889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This model predicts that Ca2+ also should promote large changes in the MPEG accessibility of cysteines in the ligand binding domain (Fig. 7, shown in red). This has been confirmed experimentally (37Anyatonwu G. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the Ca2+-dependent change in MPEG accessibility of fragment V also was observed when the MPEG reaction was carried out after the receptor had been first cleaved with trypsin (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous findings that the receptor retains function even when partially digested with trypsin (38Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 328-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Our experiments also provide information on the accessibility of residues in the C-terminal tail. A cysteine substitution introduced at the last amino acid of the tail (A2749C) was readily accessible to both MPEG-5 and MPEG-20 in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3). By contrast, none of other three cysteine substitution mutants in the C-tail (S2681C, S2703C, and S2716C) or the three endogenous cysteines (Cys2610, Cys2613, and Cys2642) were reactive with MPEG-5. The S2703C and S2716C sites are located in a coiled-coil domain present in the C-tail (Fig. 3A), and it is therefore possible that these sites are occluded because of oligomerization of this domain (7Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of Ca2+, there was an enhanced reactivity of the S2716C site and to a lesser extent the S2703C site. We also have shown that trypsin (22 kDa) gains access to a cleavage site within the last 24 amino acids of the C-tail only in the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, Yoshikawa et al. (21Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) also observed that the tip of the C-terminal tail was labile to trypsin, although in their study, this occurred only with higher concentrations of trypsin, and Ca2+ was not included in the incubations. We conclude from our data that only the most terminal amino acids of the C-tail are solvent-exposed in the absence of Ca2+ and that the conformational changes induced by Ca2+ cause an increase in accessibility of the tail which is most marked (based on the MPEG gel-shift assay) for the ∼35 C-terminal amino acids.Our interpretation of these observations is based on the hypothesis that the 160 amino acid C-tail projects perpendicularly from the membrane and runs in a central channel formed by the ligand binding domain (Fig. 7). This arrangement is consistent with the limited access of endogenous or substituted cysteine residues in the C-tail in the absence of Ca2+. In this model, the terminal residues of the C-tail are proposed to project from the central density into the solvent space. This orientation is analogous to the C-tail of the full-length KcsA channel, whose recently published crystal structure shows a long perpendicular helix with a small bulge helix near the membrane (39Uysal S. Vásquez V. Tereshko V. Esaki K. Fellouse F.A. Sidhu S.S. Koide S. Perozo E. Kossiakoff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6644-6649Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This model also is consistent with the reported ability of recombinant domains from the IP3R C-tail to form dimers (40Galvan D.L. Mignery G.A. J. Biol.

When Ca2+ is present, we suggest that a conformational transition initiated in the ligand binding domain and transmitted to the connected side arms, results in the opening of a crevice in the central density that would account for the enhanced accessibility of the C-tail under these conditions (Fig. 7B). Deletion mutants of the C-tail appear to enhance reactivity of the endogenous cysteines in trypsin fragment V even without added Ca2+ (Fig. 5B). The reason for this is not clear, but we speculate that the absence of a correctly folded C-tail may increase the MPEG-5 accessible space around the reactive cysteines.A number of proteins of different sizes have been proposed to interact with the C-tail at various locations (Fig. 3A). These include 4.1N, 98 kDa (41Fukatsu K. Bannai H. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); BclXl, 26 kDa (42White C. Li C.

In addition, Ser2618 is the phosphorylation site for Akt kinase (56 kDa (27Khan M.T. Wagner 2nd, L. Yule D.I. Bhanumathy C. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3731-3737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Szado T. Vanderheyden V. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Rietdorf K. Kotelevets L. Chastre E. Khan F.

Parys J.B. Fissore R.A. Cell Calcium. 2009; 46: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). Because of these interactions, it has generally been assumed that the C-tail is freely accessible along its entire length in the native receptor. The present data using MPEG reactivity and trypsin cleavage suggest that this may not be the case. In those instances where the protein interacts with the C-terminal 14 amino acids (e.g. PP1-α and 4.1N) accessibility should not be an issue. However, proteins interacting further into the tail would be expected to require Ca2+-induced conformational changes or other structural alterations of the receptor to facilitate accessibility to their binding sites. We have shown that the phosphorylation of the receptor by Akt kinase is indeed enhanced in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the functional effect of cytochrome c is observed only in the presence of Ca2+ (48Boehning D. Patterson R.L. Sedaghat L. Glebova N.O. Kurosaki T. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), and the interaction with G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein also is stimulated by cytosolic Ca2+ elevation (45Zhang S. Hisatsune C. Matsu-Ura T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29158-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the available data, we would suggest that Ca2+ could be an important factor regulating protein-protein interactions with the IP3R and that even a transient elevation of Ca2+ might be sufficient to allow association of interacting proteins with the C-tail.Ca2+ activates channel function at low concentrations and has an inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. What, then, is the functional significance of the Ca2+-induced conformational changes observed in the present study? Whether these changes accompany activation or inhibition of the channel is difficult to assess from the present data. The half-maximal concentration over which the Ca2+ effects are observed are ∼0.5 μm. These concentrations are larger than required to activate the channel in 45Ca2+ flux assays on COS cell microsomes (26Boehning D. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21492-21499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Schug Z.T. da Fonseca P.C. Bhanumathy C.D. Wagner 2nd, L. Zhang X. Bailey B. Morris E.P. Yule D.I. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 2939-2948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A key feature of the inhibitory site is that the affinity for Ca2+ is decreased by IP3 (5Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the Ca2+ effect on trypsin cleavage was decreased by IP3, although IP3 had no effects on the Ca2+ stimulation of MPEG reactivity (data not shown). This does not necessarily mean that Ca2+ mediates two different effects at two distinct sites. In the model shown in Fig. 7, conformational changes induced by IP3 in the central domain could interfere with the access of trypsin without necessarily affecting MPEG access. In our experiments Sr2+, rather than Ba2+, facilitated the conformational changes in the receptor. This is the specificity reported for the activatory binding site in the liver (23Marshall I.C. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The location and function of divalent cation binding sites in the IP3R has not been established firmly, and multiple Ca2+ binding sites could function to both activate and inhibit the channel (5Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). A “Ca2+ sensor” mutation (E2100D) has been described in which the Ca2+ sensitivity for activation and inhibition of the channel are decreased (20Tu H. Nosyreva E. Miyakawa T. Wang Z. Mizushima A. Iino M. Bezprozvanny I. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 290-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This mutant also showed a decreased sensitivity for the Ca2+ effect on MPEG reactivity. In addition, the removal of the N-terminal suppressor domain was sufficient to prevent the Ca2+ effect entirely. These data support the view that the suppressor domain may be critically important for driving Ca2+-dependent conformational changes in the receptor. Further mutagenesis studies are required to identify distinct Ca2+ binding sites in the receptor and to understand the relationship of conformational changes in the protein to channel function.

White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Three different isoforms exist, which can form homo- and heteroligomers. All three isoforms consist of an IP3 binding domain in the N-terminal region, a channel domain containing six transmembrane segments in the C-terminal region and an intervening regulatory domain. Apart from IP3, the principal regulator of the channel is Ca2+, which exerts a biphasic effect on channel function with activation at low concentrations and inhibition at high concentrations. The structural organization of this complex protein and the mechanism by which binding of IP3 and Ca2+ are linked to channel gating are active areas of investigation.An important feature of the mechanism of the channel involves conformational changes in the protein. In particular, the gating mechanism is thought to involve conformational changes initiated by IP3 binding that are propagated to various regions of the channel domain (6Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The IP3 binding domain of the receptor is organized into a “core” segment that binds IP3 with high affinity (amino acids 226–604) and a “suppressor domain” that inhibits IP3 binding to the core (amino acids 1–225). Crystal structures for the suppressor domain and the IP3-liganded core domain have been obtained (8Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T.

Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Biophysical measurements using fusion proteins encoding the ligand binding domain have suggested that IP3 favors the formation of compact conformations, whereas Ca2+ promotes the formation of more extended structures (10Chan J. Whitten A.E. Jeffries C.M. Bosanac I. Mal T.K. Ito J. Porumb H. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Trewhella J. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conformational changes induced by IP3 also have been observed by gel-filtration analysis (11Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C.

Conformational changes promoted by Ca2+ have been observed in electron microscopy analysis of detergent purified IP3Rs from mouse cerebellum. In this system, Ca2+ transforms receptors from a square to a windmill shape (14Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

RBP4 was described recently as a new adipokine that reduced insulin sensitivity. Mice lacking glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in adipocytes have enhanced Rbp4 gene expression; however, the molecular mechanism is unknown. We found a G4KA (GLUT4 knockdown-dependent transcriptional activation) element located approximately 1.3 kb upstream of the Rbp4 promoter. Mutations within the G4KA sequence significantly reduced expression of the Rbp4 promoter-reporter construct in G4KD-L1 (GLUT4 knockdown 3T3-L1) adipocyte cells. In a yeast one-hybrid screen of a G4KD-L1 cell cDNA library, using the G4KA element as bait, we identified subunits of the 20 S proteasome, PSMB1 and PSMA4, as binding partners. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, both subunits bound to the G4KA element; however, only PSMB1 was tightly bound in the GLUT4 knockdown model. PSMB1 RNA interference, but not PSMA4, significantly inhibited Rbp4 transcription. Nuclear transportation of PSMB1 was increased in G4KD-L1 cells. These results provide evidence for an exclusive proteasome subunit-related mechanism for transcriptional activation of RBP4 within a GLUT4 knockdown model."
