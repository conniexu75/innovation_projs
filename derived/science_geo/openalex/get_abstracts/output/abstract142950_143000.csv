Two recently identified point mutations in α-synuclein are the only known genetic causes of PD. α-Synuclein fibrils similar to the Lewy body filaments can be formedin vitro, and we have shown recently that both PD-linked mutations accelerate their formation. This study addresses the mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation: we show that (i) it is a nucleation-dependent process that can be seeded by aggregated α-synuclein functioning as nuclei, (ii) this fibril growth follows first-order kinetics with respect to α-synuclein concentration, and (iii) mutant α-synuclein can seed the aggregation of wild type α-synuclein, which leads us to predict that the Lewy bodies of familial PD patients with α-synuclein mutations will contain both, the mutant and the wild type protein. Finally (iv), we show that wild type and mutant forms of α-synuclein do not differ in their critical concentrations. These results suggest that differences in aggregation kinetics of α-synucleins cannot be explained by differences in solubility but are due to different nucleation rates. Consequently, α-synuclein nucleation may be the rate-limiting step for the formation of Lewy body α-synuclein fibrils in Parkinson's disease.

Parkinson's disease wild type Parkinson's disease (PD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal system but also several other regions of the brain. A pathological hallmark of PD are Lewy bodies (1Lewy F.H. Lewandowski M. Handbuch der Neurologie. Springer, Berlin1912: 920-933Google Scholar, 2Pollanen M.S. Dickson D.W. Bergeron C. J. Neuropathol.

The major filamentous component of Lewy bodies is α-synuclein (4Spillantini G.M. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Lately, two dominant mutations in α-synuclein causing familial early onset PD have been described (9Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J.

Very recent in vitro studies have shown that recombinant α-synuclein can indeed form Lewy body-like fibrils (11Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 12El-Agnaf O. Jakes R. Curran M. Wallace A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 13Hashimoto M.

Most importantly, both PD-linked α-synuclein mutations accelerate this aggregation process (11Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), which immediately suggests that such in vitro studies may have relevance for PD pathogenesis. We therefore decided to address the kinetic mechanism of α-synuclein fibrillogenesis. We have shown before that in a complete aggregation time course α-synuclein aggregation is slow and displays a distinct lag phase (15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). This might be indicative of a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism consisting of an initial lag phase (nucleation) followed by a growth phase (elongation) and a steady state phase in which the ordered aggregate and monomer are at equilibrium. In the lag phase a supersaturated protein solution remains stable while soluble pre-nucleus oligomers build up. Once nuclei are formed, the aggregates grow rapidly (elongation phase) until a thermodynamic equilibrium between aggregate and monomer is reached. Under these steady state conditions the growth equilibrium constant describes the solubility of the protein, which is equivalent to its critical concentration (16Andreu J.M. Timasheff S.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At concentrations above the critical concentration the nucleation step can be bypassed by the addition of exogenous nuclei (17, 18, 20, for review see Ref. 19Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). To rigorously demonstrate the nucleation dependence of α-synuclein aggregation, we needed to show a lag phase, a seeding effect, and a critical concentration of monomer at equilibrium. We report here that α-synuclein aggregation fulfills all criteria of a nucleation-dependent polymerization process. In this regard α-synuclein fibril formation resembles that of β-amyloid (Aβ) fibers (20Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 21Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 22Wood S.J. Chan W. Wetzel R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12623-12628Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and paired helical filaments (18Friedhoff P. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.-M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), two protein aggregates characteristic for Alzheimer's disease. Interestingly, the critical concentrations of wild type and mutant α-synuclein do not differ significantly, suggesting that the accelerated aggregation of the α-synuclein mutations is not due to a decreased solubility of mutant monomer or increased stability of mutant fiber, respectively, but rather due to different nucleation rates. Therefore, α-synuclein nucleation may be the rate-limiting step for the formation of Lewy body α-synuclein fibrils in Parkinson's disease. In this light it was of interest to show that nuclei formed of mutant α-synuclein can function as a seed for elongation by wild type α-synuclein, which is a situation similar to the one found in familial PD cases. Bacterial expression and purification of α-synuclein was done as described before (15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli cell paste was homogenized in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, with protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells in suspension were broken by passaging through a Microfluidizer, and a clarified lysate supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 45 min. E. colicontaminating proteins were precipitated by acid precipitation of the lysate supernatant. The pH was adjusted to 3.5, and after stirring for 20–30 min, the mixture was centrifuged for 1 h at 27,000 ×g. After adjusting the pH of the resulting supernatant to 7.5, the sample was applied to Q-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and eluted with a NaCl gradient in equilibration buffer. α-Synuclein-containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and are >99% pure. The concentration of α-synuclein was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and employing ε2800.1% of 0.354, determined by using Genetics Computer Group software. Purified samples of α-synuclein were concentrated to >7 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 200 mm NaCl) + 0.05% sodium azide and sterile filtered through 0.22-μm filters to remove any particulate matter. The filtrates were all adjusted to a final concentration in the range of 2–7 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% sodium azide and incubated at 37 °C in parafilm-sealed, 1.5-ml Beckman ultracentrifuge tubes. At various time points, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and the α-synuclein content of their supernatants was analyzed by measuring their absorbance at 280 nm. The concentration of α-synuclein was then determined employing ε2800.1% = 0.354. Supernatants of samples with concentrations 4 mg/ml or higher were first diluted 1:10 with Tris-buffered saline (11 μl of sample + 99 μl of buffer) whereas supernatants of samples at concentrations below 4 mg/ml were analyzed directly (100 μl). The remainder of the sample was vortexed for 30 s to resuspend pelleted material and then allowed to continue incubation at 37 °C. If the supernatant was analyzed neat, the 100-μl aliquot used for absorbance measurements was returned to the original incubation tube that was then vortexed for 30 s and placed back at 37 °C. Curve fits for aggregation time courses (i.e. A 280 versus time) were drawn manually. Solutions of wt or A53T α-synuclein at 7 mg/ml were incubated at 37 °C for 3 days in an Eppendorf Thermomixer with continuous shaking (high speed); under these conditions the equilibrium was reached. Reported seed concentrations are based on the amount of monomeric protein used, assuming complete aggregation of the starting material. The material was stored frozen at −20 °C until needed. Incubations of soluble α-synuclein at concentrations ranging from 2–7 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% sodium azide were spiked with various amounts of preformed α-synuclein aggregates to serve as nuclei for fibril formation. The final concentration of seed is reported as a percentage of the soluble α-synuclein in the incubation (e.g. a 2 mg/ml incubation seeded at a level of 10% contains 0.2 mg/ml seed). Loss of soluble α-synuclein is measured byA 280 of soluble material following ultracentrifugation as described above. Critical concentrations were determined for wt and A53T mutant α-synuclein as described in Jarrett et al. (20Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein was incubated at 7 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5 + 0.05% sodium azide at 37 °C for 3 days with continuous shaking in an Eppendorf Thermomixer (high speed) to ensure complete aggregation. Following this treatment, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 100,000 ×g, the supernatants were collected, filtered through 0.22-μm filters and analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis to determine protein content. Samples were transferred to pyrolyzed glass vial inserts, dried, and transferred to a Water's Picotag reaction vial, which contained 1 ml of a hydrolysis mixture (6n hydrochloric acid, 0.05% phenol, 0.001% β-mercaptoethanol). The reaction vial was purged with nitrogen and then sealed under vacuum; hydrolysis took place at 110 °C for 24 h. The sample glass inserts were removed and dried, and the samples were reconstituted in sample buffer containing the internal standard norleucine and analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (sodium format). Specialized software was used to calculate concentrations from the observed amino acids and internal standard recoveries. The software calculates a correlation coefficient and an average percentage difference between the observed and theoretical number of residues. To study the kinetics of α-synuclein fibrillogenesis the aggregated material was pelleted by centrifugation and the concentration of the remaining soluble material in the supernatant was determined (see “Experimental Procedures”). The loss of soluble material was paralleled by an increase in pellet size. In addition, we followed α-synuclein aggregation by turbidity measurements (data not shown) and showed earlier by electron and fluid phase atomic force microscopy that the light-scattering, sedimentable material is actually fibrillar (15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that α-synuclein forms fibrillar aggregatesin vitro and that this aggregation is preceded by a lag phase that is followed by a period of exponential aggregate formation (15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar); both are monitored and pictured in Fig.1 as a loss of soluble wild type α-synuclein (filled symbols). This kinetic profile is indicative of a nucleated assembly process. In such a case, addition of exogenous nuclei (seeds) should start elongation instantly and thus expedite aggregation. Consistent with this prediction, the addition of preformed wild type α-synuclein aggregates did indeed seed soluble α-synuclein resulting in immediate aggregation as shown in Fig. 1 (open versus filled symbols). Seed concentrations in this experiment ranged from 0.001% () of the soluble α-synuclein amount up to 10% (⋄), and it is instantly apparent that the aggregation rate of soluble α-synuclein is controlled by the seed content in a dose-dependent manner. Analyzing the data from Fig. 1 as the time required to deplete 50% of the soluble starting material (t 12) allows a quantitative comparison of the seeding efficiency. At 2 mg/ml under our aggregation conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) unseeded wild type α-synuclein (▪) aggregated with a half-life of 18 days. With the seed content consisting of only 0.001% () of the soluble α-synuclein, the t 12 already decreased to 16 days. At 0.01% (⊞) seed the t 12was 11 days and seed concentrations of 0.1 (Δ), 1 (○), and 10% (⋄) seed resulted in a further decrease of half-lives to 7, 4, and 0.5 days, respectively. Once the nuclei are present, either by de novo formation or exogenous addition, α-synuclein fibril elongation is predicted to proceed via the deposition of soluble α-synuclein units onto the existing templates provided by these nuclei. This process should be concentration-dependent with respect to the soluble α-synuclein concentration. We addressed this question by adding a fixed amount of exogenous, preformed seed (0.6 mg/ml) to incubations containing various concentrations of soluble α-synuclein (1–6 mg/ml) and followed its aggregation over time (Fig.2 A). In all tested concentrations the initial rates of soluble α-synuclein loss were linear or near linear until they started to level off, due to depletion of soluble material, and ultimately plateaued at the critical concentration; the rates decreased proportionally with decreasing α-synuclein concentration. In a seeded paradigm the rates of soluble α-synuclein loss are inversely proportional to the fiber elongation rates. Calculated initial elongation rates from this experiment are shown in Fig. 2 B as a function of soluble α-synuclein concentration. The linear correlation suggests that α-synuclein elongation is a first order process with respect to α-synuclein concentration. The experiments described above have addressed wild type α-synuclein aggregation. However, Fig.3 demonstrates that α-synuclein carrying the naturally occurring, dominant A53T mutation can also be homogeneously seeded (open versus filled symbols) and consequently also aggregates by a nucleation-dependent mechanism. As with wild type α-synuclein the rate of fibrillogenesis is seed concentration-dependent (○, 1%; ⋄, 10% seed). The dominant A53T α-synuclein mutation is associated with familial Parkinson's disease and co-expressed with the wild type form in mutation carriers. We have shown earlier that A53T as well as the only other known familial PD mutation displays accelerated aggregation and a significant reduction in the lag phase of this process. It was of immediate interest to test the hypothesis that the pathogenic mutant α-synuclein could act as heterogeneous seed for the soluble wild type protein. In Fig. 4 we added preformed aggregates of A53T α-synuclein to wild type α-synuclein and incubated under our standard aggregation conditions. Consistent with the data set shown in Fig. 1 the nonseeded control (▪) did not aggregate during the time course of this experiment. However, A53T seed concentrations comprising 1% (○) or 10% (⋄) of the soluble α-synuclein present in the incubation resulted in immediate fibril growth. The effect of heterogeneous seeding was, like in homogeneous seeding, clearly seed concentration-dependent: at 1% and 10% seed one-half of the soluble material was aggregated at 6 and 2 days, respectively. To determine the critical concentrations of α-synuclein proteins, wild type and A53T mutant preparations were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C and continuous shaking to ensure complete aggregation and equilibrium between fibers and soluble material. After centrifugation the supernatants were analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis. The critical concentrations for wild type and A53T α-synuclein were 0.41 ± 0.01 mg/ml (28 μm) and 0.38 ± 0.09 mg/ml (26 μm), respectively, showing no statistically significant difference between these two isoforms. Lewy bodies that contain α-synuclein as their major fibrillar component are one of the hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. If and how Lewy bodies cause neuronal (or glial) degeneration is currently not known; however, the finding that two α-synuclein mutations cause autosomal dominant familial PD makes an α-synuclein cascade hypothesis attractive for PD. This hypothesis would assume that mutant α-synuclein would trigger the formation of Lewy bodies that in turn would cause the downstream PD pathology. Support for this model comes from recentin vitro studies, which demonstrate that purified full-length α-synuclein can indeed form fibrils similar to those found in Lewy bodies (11Conway K.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and which suggest aggregation-promoting conditions (23Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Xia Y. Takeda A. Sundsmo M. Masliah E. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Most importantly, both mutations accelerate the formation of these fibrils (11Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Thus, the in vitro experiments mirror a critical aspect of the biology. The mechanism of this fibrillogenesis has not yet been addressed. In this study we show that α-synuclein aggregation follows a nucleation-elongation mechanism. Figs. 1 and 3 demonstrate that aggregation of both wild type and A53T mutant α-synuclein is rate-limited by a nucleation step. The addition of seeds, which act as nuclei, to aggregation-competent, supersaturated solutions of α-synuclein bypasses the lag phase and causes rapid aggregation. The aggregation rates are controlled by the seed content in a dose-dependent manner. By keeping the seed concentration constant and varying the soluble α-synuclein concentration we could show that its aggregation is also dependent on the soluble α-synuclein concentration (Fig. 2). The results suggest that α-synuclein fiber elongation is a first order process with respect to α-synuclein concentration. Interestingly, the elongation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) fibrils, which has been studied extensively by Maggio and colleagues (17Esler W.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Vinters H.V. Lee J.P. Mantyh P.W.

Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), follows first order kinetics, indicating that both Aβ and α-synuclein may follow the same general nucleation/elongation principles. We have determined the critical concentrations for wild type and A53T mutant forms of α-synuclein and found them to be indistinguishable within experimental error. This demonstrates that the enhanced aggregation tendency of the mutant forms is a kinetic effect and not due to an intrinsically lower solubility or higher fiber stability, respectively. It is tempting to speculate that the mutations lower the activation energy of critical regions of α-synuclein to convert from random coil to β-sheet, the conformation observed in the aggregate (15Narhi L. Wood S.J. Steavenson S. Jiang Y. Wu G.M. Anafi D. Kaufman S.A. Martin F. Sitney K. Denis P. Louis J.C. Wypych J. Biere A.L. Citron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9843-9846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), and that this conformation shift causes the rate-limiting nuclei to form. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that the nucleation of wild type and mutant α-synuclein forms could be mechanistically different. Also, additional factors may play a role as well as additional functional differences between wild type and mutant α-synuclein, e.g. α-synuclein vesicle binding (25Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F.

It will be of interest to study the early events of nuclei formation and determine the nuclei size as well as the size and nature of potential intermediates. Such intermediates have been reported for different stages of other nucleated fibril formations, e.g.pre-nucleus dimers and post-nucleus protofibers in tau and amyloid β-peptide fibrillogenesis (18Friedhoff P. von Bergen M.

Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar) preliminary observations utilizing among other methods fluid phase atomic force microscopy do indeed suggest the existence of other soluble α-synuclein species (data not shown). Most importantly, wild type α-synuclein cannot only be seeded by its own fibrils but can also be cross-seeded by mutant α-synuclein fibrils (Fig. 4) excluding significant structural differences at the elongation sites or growing tips of the two fiber types. This was intriguing and maybe even unexpected after recent studies reported structural differences in fibers of wild type and A53T mutant α-synuclein (14Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting to study the ultrastructure of heterogeneous fibers. However, the fact that heterogeneous seeding is possible suggests that not only does mutant α-synuclein nucleate and consequently aggregate faster than wild type but that in a heterogeneous in vivo situation the lag phase of wild type α-synuclein aggregation is reduced to the one of the mutant protein; thus the mutant protein exerts its aggregation-accelerating effect on the total α-synuclein population. Based on this result we make the testable prediction that the Lewy bodies of mutation carriers will contain both the mutant and the wild type α-synuclein protein. It appears reasonable to hypothesize that under normal circumstances α-synuclein could show transient supersaturation in subcellular compartments of some neural cells. This transient supersaturation would not be harmful per se because individuals carrying the wild type α-synuclein allele would be protected from Lewy body formation by the long lag phase of the nucleation. However, α-synuclein mutations or unknown cellular factors could bypass the lag phase by increasing the rate of nuclei formation, enabling fibril growth and eventually causing their precipitation. In this scenario, α-synuclein nucleation would be at the core of Lewy body formation and nucleation inhibitors would, at least in principle, have therapeutic promise.

The three genes identified encode phospholipase C and two potential inositol polyphosphate kinases. Together, these constitute a signaling pathway from phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). The common downstream effects of mutations in each component were deficiencies in IP6 synthesis and messenger RNA export, indicating a role for IP6 in GLE1 function and messenger RNA export."

Targeting of these enzymes near the substrate is proposed to enhance phosphorylation-dependent modulation. Yotiao, an NMDA receptor-associated protein, bound the type I protein phosphatase (PP1) and the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme. Anchored PP1 was active, limiting channel activity, whereas PKA activation overcame constitutive PP1 activity and conferred rapid enhancement of NMDA receptor currents. Hence, yotiao is a scaffold protein that physically attaches PP1 and PKA to NMDA receptors to regulate channel activity."

In this study, we isolated hepatocytes, LSECs, and Kupffer cells and measured steady-state levels of fVIII mRNA in these preparations. Our results indicate that both LSECs and hepatocytes synthesize fVIII mRNA. Additionally, LSECs in culture secrete active fVIII, providing a model for studies of the regulation of homologous fVIII gene expression. Gey's balanced salt solution, Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Liver Digest Medium, DMEM/F-12 medium, and AIM-V medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Penicillin (50 units/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) were added to DMEM/F-12 medium. Collagenase (type IV), gelatin, and dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma. DNase I was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). The following murine monoclonal IgG1κ antibodies were purchased from Pharmigen (San Diego, CA): FITC-conjugated anti-PECAM-1 (anti-CD31), FITC-conjugated anti-VCAM-1 (anti-CD106), PE-conjugated anti-ICAM-1 (anti-CD54), the corresponding FITC-conjugated- and PE-conjugated isotype-specific control antibodies, and biotinylated anti-ICAM-1. FITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Streptavidin-conjugated and anti-CD11b-conjugated magnetic beads were purchased from Miltenyi, Inc. (Auburn, CA). Single cell suspensions were prepared from livers of five or six 10–12-week-old Balb/c female mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Laboratories). Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with sodium pentobarbital. Livers were perfused in situ via the portal vein with 15–20 ml of Gey's balanced salt solution with drainage through a severed inferior vena cava. Livers were perfused with 60 ml of liver digest medium at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and then removed and submerged in DMEM/F-12 medium on ice. Subsequent steps were carried at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. To purify hepatocytes, liver capsules were gently disrupted in DMEM/F-12 medium using two 1-ml serological pipettes. The hepatocytes were allowed to settle by gravity for 5 min and then washed five times with DMEM/F-12 medium by gravity sedimentation. To obtain sinusoidal cells (LSECs and Kupffer cells), gall bladders were removed and the livers were minced with a sterile razor blade. The livers were digested with 0.02% (w/v) collagenase and 0.0005% (w/v) DNase I in 50 ml of HBSS containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional shaking. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 75-μm nylon mesh and the filtrate was centrifuged at 50 × g for 5 min to pellet the hepatocytes. The supernatant was removed and pelleted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The cells were washed once with HBSS, layered over a 1.037 g/ml solution of Percoll (Pharmacia) and centrifuged at 400 × g for 20 min. The resulting upper layer and interface, containing Ito cells, dead cells, and debris, were removed. The lower layer was diluted 3-fold with Dulbecco's PBS and centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min to pellet the cells. Kupffer cells and LSECs were isolated by anti-CD11b-conjugated and biotinylated ICAM-1/streptavidin-conjugated magnetic bead cell sorting, respectively, over MS+ MiniMACS separation columns (Miltenyi, Inc.) according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cell pellet from the Percoll centrifugation step was suspended in 0.45 ml of Dulbecco's PBS, 0.5% biotin-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mm EDTA, followed by addition of anti-CD11b-conjugated magnetic beads and elution of anti-CD11b-positive cells. Biotinylated anti-ICAM-I antibodies (50 μg/ml) were added to the anti-CD11b-nonadherent fraction for 15 min, followed by isolation of LSECs using streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. Both preparations were eluted with DMEM/F-12 medium, 15% FBS, dibutyryl cAMP (250 μg/ml) and stored at concentration of 1–2 × 106 cells per ml. Approximately 3 × 106LSECs were obtained from six livers. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Freshly isolated LSECs were plated onto 0.1% (w/v) gelatin-coated 12-well Falcon 3043 plates (401 mm2 per well) at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well. The cells were incubated for 2 h, non-adherent cells were washed off with HBSS and fresh medium containing DMEM/F-12, 15% FBS, 250 μg/ml dibutyryl cAMP was added. Initially, the cells were 30–40% confluent and grew to confluence in 1 or 2 days. Each well contained approximately 1 × 105 cells at confluence. Confluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from the Emory Skin Cell Center and were also maintained in DMEM/F-12, 15% FBS, 250 μg/ml dibutyryl cAMP. For studies of fVIII secretion, confluent monolayers were washed three times with HBSS and then maintained in AIM-V, a serum-free cell culture medium for 2 days. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were plated onto collagen-coated Costar six-well plates (962 mm2 per well) at 6 × 105 cells per well for 30 min in DMEM/F-12, 10% FBS. Nonadherent cells were washed off with HBSS. Hepatocytes were maintained in medium containing DMEM/F-12 plus 10% FBS for 2 days prior to assay for fVIII secretion. Purified cells were prepared for differential staining and light microscopy by centrifugation onto microscope slides using a Cytospin 3 Cell Preparation System (Shandon Scientific, Cheshire, United Kingdom). Cells were stained using a modified Wright-Giemsa stain (Diff-Quik, Baxter, McGaw Park, IL). Freshly isolated LSECs and trypsin/EDTA-solubilized cultured LSECs were characterized further by flow cytometry. Cells were diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml with Dulbecco's PBS, 3% FBS and incubated with saturating concentrations of dye-labeled specific antibody, isotype control antibody, or wheat germ agglutinin. The cells were washed once and resuspended in Dulbecco's PBS, 3% FBS. Data collection and analysis were done using a Becton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer and CellQuest software. Total RNA from hepatocyte, Kupffer cell, and LSEC preparations and from cultured LSECs was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Santa Clarita, CA). RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 25 ml/mg/cm. Reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions were conducted using a First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Pharmacia), 0.2 μg of total RNA template and primers specific for fVIII, von Willebrand factor (vWf) or factor IX (Table I).Table IOligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCRGeneOligonucleotide (5′ → 3′)PositionaNumbering is based on the cDNA sequences of murine fVIII (GenBank accession number L05573) and murine factor IX (GenBank accession number M23109). vWf numbering is by homology to the human vWf cDNA sequence (47).RT primersFVIII A3GCCCATGCTGAGAAGATACCATCG6189–6212FVIII C2GTATTGCTGCTGGGCCTCACATCC7341–7364Factor IXTTTTCCCCAGCCACTGACATAGCCA1044–1068vWfGGCAGTTGCAGACCCTCCTTG5124–5144PCR primersFVIII A3 senseGTCCCTACTCCTTCTATTCTAGCC5713–5736FVIII A3 antisenseGCCCATGCTGAGAAGATACCATCG6189–6212FVIII C2 senseCTTCGCATGGAGTTGATGGGCTGT6852–6875FVIII C2 antisenseTCATCATAGGTGTGGATGAGTCCTG7227–7251Factor IX senseCTCGAGTTGTTGGTGGAGAAAACG668–691Factor IX antisenseTTTTCCCCAGCCACTGACATAGCCA1044–1068vWf senseATGATGGAGAGGTTACACATC4015–4035vWf antisenseGGCAGTTGCAGACCCTCCTTG5124–5144Primers were designed based on the murine fVIII (32Elder B.

The resulting cDNA fragments were amplified by PCR usingTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and the primers listed in Table I. Samples were denatured for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 2 min at 55 °C, and elongation for 2 min at 72 °C. Reactions were completed by a final elongation step for 5 min at 72 °C. The products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized using ethidium bromide. FVIII mRNA levels in LSECs and hepatocytes were quantitated by a modification of published competitive RT-PCR procedures (13Wang A.M. Doyle M.V. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 14Powell E.E. Kroon P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 609-613PubMed Google Scholar, 15Saghizadeh M. Ong J.M. Garvey W.T. Henry R.R.

In this method, a known concentration of fVIII-specific cRNA is added to the RT reaction, which produces a cDNA that competes for the native fVIII cDNA during PCR amplification. The point of equivalence, where cRNA-derived and mRNA-derived cDNA products are equal, determines the number of mRNA molecules in the sample. To initially test the method, two regions of fVIII were amplified using cRNAs and PCR primers corresponding to the A3 and C2 domains of murine fVIII. The PCR products contained intron-spanning sequences to avoid potential signals from contaminating genomic DNA. The cRNAs were identical to endogenous fVIII mRNA except for an internal 50-bp deletion so that the resulting cRNA-derived PCR product could be distinguished from the endogenous fVIII PCR product electrophoretically. This produced 500/450- and 400/350-bp products for the A3-specific and C2-specific PCR reactions, respectively. The first step in the cRNA constructions was synthesis of cDNAs containing 50-bp loop-outs. The cDNAs were synthesized by PCR amplification of RT products obtained from total liver RNA using the A3-specific and C2-specific primers shown in Table I. The A3 sense loop-out primer, 5′-AAAACTGCAGGTCCCTACTCCTTCTATTCTAGCCGTCAAGCCTAATGAAACCAAAATTTATTTTTGG-3′, corresponded to murine fVIII cDNA nucleotides 5713–5819 with the deletion of nucleotides 5737–5786. The A3 antisense primer, 5′- TTTTCTGCAGGCCCATGCTGAGAAGATACCATCG-3′, corresponded to nucleotides 6189–6212. The C2 sense loop-out primer, 5′-AAAACTGCAGCTTCGCATGGAGTTGATGGGCTGTAGATACACAAATCACTGCCTCATCC-3′, corresponded to nucleotides 6852–6950 with the deletion of nucleotides 6876–6925. The C2 antisense primer, 5′-TTTTCTGCAGGTATTGCTGCTGGGCCTCACATCCTAG- 3′, corresponded to nucleotides 7341–7364. The loop-out cDNA products were cloned into pBluescript II phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using PstI restriction sites that had been incorporated into the PCR primers (underlined). The sequence of the cDNA products was verified by dideoxy sequencing. The cRNA was produced by T3 RNA polymerase-catalyzed in vitrotranscription off pBluescript using a Ribomax Transcription Kit (Promega) and purified using a RNeasy Mini Kit. The molar concentration of cRNA was calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm and the molecular weight. The cRNA-dependent inhibition of endogenous fVIII cDNA synthesis was quantitated by densitometry of ethidium bromide-stained products. Gel photographs were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 6200C ScanJet scanner and were analyzed using digitization and quantitation software (UN-SCAN-IT, Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). Plots of the ratio of mRNA-derived and cRNA-derived products as a function of cRNA concentration were linear. The point of equivalence was determined by linear regression analysis. The measurement of fVIII in cell culture supernatants was measured using a plasma-free chromogenic assay that measures the thrombin-activated fVIII-dependent rate of factor X activation by factor IXa as described previously (16Lubin I.M. Healey J.F. Scandella D. Runge M.S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8639-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7821-7827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction components included limiting activated factor VIII, 0.5 nm porcine factor IXa, 425 nm porcine factor X, and 50 μm phospholipid. The initial rate of factor Xa formation was measured using the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme Xa (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT). The results were compared with a standard curve prepared using human recombinant VIII of known coagulant activity (provided by Hyland-Immuno Div., Baxter Healthcare, Duarte, CA). Hepatocytes were isolated from liver cell suspensions by low speed centrifugation. They were identified as large (20–25 μm), frequently binucleate cells with basophilic cytoplasm. The preparation was less than 5% contaminated by other cell types. Kupffer cell preparations were obtained using anti-CD11b magnetic bead cell sorting and identified by their relatively large size (10–12 μm), eccentric nuclei, and numerous vacuoles. CD11b-positive preparations contained approximately 80% Kupffer cells/monocytes and 20% granulocytes. LSECs were isolated from the CD11b-negative population by anti-ICAM-1 magnetic bead cell sorting. They were identified by their relatively small size (8–10 μm), clear cytoplasm, and oval nuclei (Fig.1 A). LSEC preparations typically were 90% pure and contained Kupffer cells (2%) and red blood cells (8%) as contaminants. Analysis of the LSEC preparation by flow cytometry demonstrated that the cells expressed cell surface markers ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 and contained a subpopulation of the cells that bound wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2). LSECs did not stain with the monocyte/macrophage-specific marker CD14 or the endothelial marker VCAM-1 (data not shown). These findings are similar to previously described phenotypic characteristics of murine LSECs, which were ICAM-1+/PECAM-1+/VCAM-1+ and contained two subpopulations that differentially bound wheat germ agglutinin (18Vidal-Vanaclocha F. Rocha M. Asumendi A. Barbera-Guillem E. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 328-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Cardier J.E. Barbera-Guillem E. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 165-175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the lack of VCAM-1 staining in our LSEC preparation is not known, although the cells became VCAM-1+ after cell culture. Initial experiments demonstrated that fVIII mRNA could be identified by RT-PCR in LSECs and hepatocytes, but not Kupffer cells (data not shown). A quantitative competitive RT-PCR method was developed to measure mRNA levels using a fVIII-specific cRNA as a source of cDNA competitor as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this method, the concentration of fVIII mRNA can be determined by finding the concentration of cRNA that produces equal amounts of mRNA-derived and cRNA-derived PCR (13Wang A.M. Doyle M.V. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Separate competitive RT-PCR analysis of total liver was performed on regions corresponding to the A3 and C2 domains of the fVIII cDNA (Table I). Levels of 6.5 × 105 and 7.4 × 105 fVIII mRNA transcripts per μg of total RNA were obtained using the A3-specific and C2-specific primers, respectively (data not shown). These results were within the experimental error of the method and verified that the region of fVIII selected for amplification did not bias the measurements. Further experiments were performed using A3-specific primers. Fig. 3 shows the results of a competitive fVIII RT-PCR assay of purified LSECs. Lanes 2–7 show that the concentration of 500-bp PCR product derived from endogenous fVIII mRNA is inversely related to the concentration of added competitor cRNA, which produces a 450-bp product. Regression analysis of the band intensities yielded a value of 3.3 × 106 fVIII mRNA transcripts/μg of total cellular RNA. Similar experiments were done using a hepatocyte preparation. The results of several experiments with LSECs and hepatocytes are shown in TableII. Purified LSECs contain approximately 5-fold more fVIII transcripts/μg of total cellular RNA than hepatocytes. Because hepatocytes contain more total RNA per cell than LSECs, hepatocytes contain approximately twice as many fVIII transcripts per cell than LSECs.Table IICompetitive RT-PCR measurements of FVIII mRNA in LSECs and hepatocytesFVIII mRNATotal RNAFVIII mRNAaCalculated from the values in the first and second columns.transcripts/μg total RNAμg/106 cellstranscripts/cellPurified LSECs3.5 ± 0.3 × 106bMean and S.D. from separate determinations from three preparations.10.6 ± 1.2bMean and S.D. from separate determinations from three preparations.37Cultured LSECs3.2 ± 0.5 × 106cMean and range from separate determinations from two preparations.10.6 ± 0.3cMean and range from separate determinations from two preparations.34Hepatocytes7.5 ± 0.8 × 105dMean and range from two RT-PCR reactions from one preparation.9370a Calculated from the values in the first and second columns.b Mean and S.D. from separate determinations from three preparations.c Mean and range from separate determinations from two preparations.d Mean and range from two RT-PCR reactions from one preparation. Open table in a new tab In parallel RT-PCR reactions, purified LSECs were positive for vWf mRNA, a marker for endothelial cells (Fig. 3, lane 10). Factor IX mRNA, a hepatocyte marker, was not detected in LSECs (Fig. 3, lane 8). Conversely, factor IX mRNA was detected in hepatocytes (Fig. 3, lane 9), but vWf mRNA was not (data not shown.). Primary monolayer cultures of LSECs were established by growing cells on gelatin in the presence of DMEM/F-12, 15% FBS, dibutyryl cAMP. LSECs were spindle-shaped and displayed long cytoplasmic extensions prior to confluence (data not shown). As they approached confluence, they formed a polygonal, flat “cobblestone” monolayer (Fig. 1 B) that is characteristic of cultured endothelial cells (20Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). Cultured LSECs were positive by flow cytometry for ICAM-1, PECAM-1, VCAM-1, and bound wheat germ agglutinin (data not shown). Competitive RT-PCR analysis of fVIII mRNA of cultured LSECs (Fig. 4) yielded levels that were indistinguishable from purified LSECs (TableII). Additionally, like purified LSECs, cultured LSECs expressed vWf, but not factor IX (Fig. 4). Cultured LSECs maintained their phenotypic characteristics when trypsinized, split 1:1, and regrown to confluence. They did not survive a second passage under the growth conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fVIII-dependent rate of factor Xa formation in LSEC supernatants was significantly greater than medium alone (Fig.5). The measured rate corresponds to 1.4 × 10−2 units/ml of coagulant activity using human fVIII as a standard. In contrast, rates of factor Xa formation due to human umbilical vein endothelial cells or dermal microvascular endothelial cells were not significantly above background. FVIII activity was not detected in primary cultures of hepatocytes (data not shown). Hepatic fVIII gene expression was studied by RT-PCR using purified populations of murine LSECs, hepatocytes, and Kupffer cells. We detected fVIII mRNA in LSECs and hepatocytes, but not Kupffer cells. The absence of factor IX mRNA, a hepatocyte marker, in purified LSECs (Fig. 3) excluded the possibility that the fVIII mRNA was due to contaminating hepatocytes. Conversely, the absence of vWf mRNA, an endothelial cell marker, in the hepatocyte preparation excluded the possibility of a false positive fVIII signal due to contaminating LSECs. We also identified fVIII mRNA in cultured LSECs (Fig. 4). This represents the first demonstration of homologous expression of fVIII mRNA in primary cell culture. In contrast, previous studies of fVIII expression in cell culture have been conducted by transfecting fVIII gene fragments into liver cell-derived cell lines (21Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11828-11838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Stirling D. Hannant W.A. Ludlam C.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our results should facilitate studies of fVIII gene regulation under more physiological conditions. There has been considerable controversy regarding which type of liver cell synthesizes fVIII. FVIII mRNA was identified in a human hepatocyte preparation by RNase protection assay (7Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, the preparation was contaminated with LSECs and Kupffer cells. In the same study, FVIII mRNA was not detected in a liver sinusoidal cell preparation. FVIII protein was localized by immune electron microscopy to the rough endoplasmic reticulum of both human hepatocytes and LSECs (12Zelechowska M.G. van Mourik J.A. Brodniewicz-Proba T. Nature. 1985; 317: 729-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, fVIII was localized immunohistologically to LSECs but not hepatocytes (9Stel H.V. van der Kwast T.H. Veerman E.C. Nature. 1983; 303: 530-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10van der Kwast T.H. Stel H.V. Cristen E. Bertina R.M. Veerman E.C.

Haematol. 1988; 70: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). FVIII activity was detected in rat LSECs, but not hepatocytes (11Hellman L. Smedsrod B. Sandberg H. Pettersson U. Br. J. Haematol. 1989; 73: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). FVIII mRNA levels were not determined in that study. Our results show that LSECs and hepatocytes make similar amounts of fVIII mRNA (40 versus 70 transcripts per cell, respectively, Table II). The ratio of hepatocytes to LSECs in liver is approximately 3 to 1 (27Schaffner F. Popper H. Berk J.E. Haubrich W.S. Kalser M.H. Roth J.L. Schaffner F. Bockus Gastroenterology. W. H. Saunders, Philadelphia1985: 2625-2658Google Scholar, 28Kuiper J. Brouwer A. Knook D.L. van Berkel T.J.C. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jakoby W.B. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1994: 791-818Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio of hepatocyte to LSEC steady-state fVIII mRNA transcripts in liver is approximately 5 to 1, suggesting that LSECs may contribute 15–20% of the normal hepatic synthesis of fVIII. FVIII levels rise to normal after liver transplantation in patients with hemophilia A, during which there can be no extrahepatic synthesis of fVIII (3Bontempo F.A. Lewis J.H. Gorenc T.J. Spero J.A. Ragni M.V. Scott J.P. Starzl T.E. Blood. 1987; 69: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that LSECs potentially synthesize hemostatically significant amounts because fVIII levels in the 15–20% range substantially ameliorate the hemostatic defect in hemophilia A. In fact, fVIII levels actually are increased in fulminant hepatic failure (29Langley P.G. Hughes R.D. Williams R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1985; 54: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Fiore L. Levine J. Deykin D. Zakim D. Boyer T.D. Hepatology: A Textbook of Liver Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1990: 546-566Google Scholar, 31Pereira L.M. Langley P.G. Hayllar K.M. Tredger J.M. Williams R. Gut. 1992; 33: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which is associated with a profound loss of protein synthesis by hepatocytes. In this setting, levels of all other hepatic coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, including fibrinogen, prothrombin, factors V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, prekallikrein, high molecular weight kininogen, protein C, plasminogen, antithrombin III, and a2-antiplasmin are decreased. Up-regulation of fVIII synthesis by LSECs may occur under these circumstances. The amount of fVIII that is secreted by cultured LSECs is consistent with significant synthesis in vivo. There are approximately 8 × 1010 LSECs in adult human liver. Synthesis of 1.4 × 10−2 units of fVIII per 105 cells over 48 h (Fig. 5) would correspond to total LSEC expression of 5,600 units/day in vivo. By comparison, the estimated daily synthesis of fVIII in adults is roughly 3000 units because total circulating fVIII is approximately 3000 units and turnover occurs approximately daily. In contrast, we did not detect fVIII activity in cultured hepatocytes. The expected levels are relatively low (1.4 × 10−2units/ml observed in LSECs corresponds to 12 pm). Cellular uptake, which occurs during heterologous expression of fVIII by Chinese hamster ovary cells (23Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or degradation by a protease secreted by hepatocytes, could account for the lack of detectable activity. The identification of fVIII in LSECs raises the question of whether endothelial cells from other tissues contribute significantly to fVIII synthesis. FVIII mRNA has been detected in spleen, lymph node, heart, brain, lung, kidney, testes, muscle, and placenta (7Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Lubin I.M. Healey J.F. Scandella D. Runge M.S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8639-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Elder B. Lakich D. Gitschier J. Genomics. 1993; 16: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is consistent with a common endothelial cell origin. However, fVIII has not been identified in cultured endothelial cells from human umbilical vein and other tissues (7Wion K.L. Kelly D. Summerfield J.A. Tuddenham E.G. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1985; 317: 726-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Jaffe E.A. Hoyer L.W. Nachman R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2757-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that human umbilical vein or dermal microvascular endothelium does not contain detectable fVIII mRNA or activity (Fig. 5). Furthermore, hemophilia A is not cured by kidney transplantation (34Webster W.P. Mandel S.R. Strike L.E. Penick G.D. Griggs T.R. Brinkhous K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 230: 1342-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,35Koene R.A. Gerlag P.G. Jansen J.L. Moulijn A.C. Skotnicki S.H. Debruyne F.J. Kunst V.A. Geerdink P. Wijdeveld P.G. Proc. Eur. Dial. Transplant Assoc. 1977; 14: 401-406PubMed Google Scholar), which further indicates that significant fVIII synthesis is not a general property of endothelium. The inability of bone marrow transplantation to cure hemophilia A (36Storb R. Marchioro T.L. Graham T.C. Willemin M. Hougie C. Thomas E.D. Blood. 1972; 40: 234-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also excludes cells of the monocyte/macrophage system as a source of fVIII synthesis, which is consistent with our finding that Kupffer cells do not contain detectable fVIII mRNA. However, several observations suggest that the extrahepatic synthesis of fVIII can be clinically significant. The most compelling finding is that liver transplantation from hemophilia A dogs to normal dogs does not produce hemophilia A (6Webster W.P. Zukoski C.F. Hutchin P. Reddick R.L. Mandel S.R. Penick G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 220: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additionally, spleen transplantation has been reported to produce increased fVIII levels in human (36Storb R. Marchioro T.L. Graham T.C. Willemin M. Hougie C. Thomas E.D. Blood. 1972; 40: 234-238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hathaway W.E. Mull M.M. Githens J.H. Groth C.G. Marchioro T.L. Starzl T.E. Transplantation. 1969; 7: 73-75PubMed Google Scholar, 38Liu D.L.

Int. 1994; 7: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) and canine hemophilia A (40Norman J.C. Covelli V.H. Sise H.S. Surgery. 1968; 64: 1-14PubMed Google Scholar), although other investigators have not observed this in the canine system (5Marchioro T.L. Hougie C. Radge H. Epstein R.B. Thomas E.D. Science. 1969; 163: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 6Webster W.P. Zukoski C.F. Hutchin P. Reddick R.L. Mandel S.R. Penick G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1971; 220: 1147-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Overall, these findings, combined with the unequivocal demonstration of endothelial synthesis of fVIII in the present study, are most consistent with the hypothesis that both LSECs and nonhepatic endothelial cells contribute significantly to fVIII synthesis. FVIII circulates bound noncovalently to vWf. In contrast to fVIII, vWf has been identified throughout the vascular endothelium and is widely used as an endothelial cell marker. Interestingly, vWf mRNA levels in liver are low relative to other tissues (41Yamamoto K. de Waard V. Fearns C. Loskutoff D.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Circulating fVIII protein levels are regulated by vWf (see Refs. 1Bloom A.L. Clin. Haematol. 1979; 8: 53-77PubMed Google Scholar and 2Lenting P.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. Blood. 1998; 92: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, for reviews). Infusion of vWf into patients with severe von Willebrand disease leads to a rapid increase in circulating fVIII levels (42Cornu P. Larrieu M.-J. Caen J. Bernard J. Br. J. Haematol. 1963; 9: 189Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Weiss H.J. Sussman I.I. Hoyer L.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 390-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This increase occurs without an increase in synthesis of fVIII mRNA (44Kaufman R.J. Dorner A.J. Fass D.N. Blood. 1999; 93: 193-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that vWf increases secretion of stored fVIII in this condition. Whether vWf influences fVIII mRNA and/or protein secretion under normal conditions is unknown. The identification of fVIII and vWf synthesis in the same cell type (Figs. 3 and 4) raises the possibility of coordinate gene regulation in vivo. The availability of cultured LSECs that synthesize both fVIII and vWf should facilitate studies in this area. Hemophilia A is an attractive target for gene therapy. Our finding that the LSEC can support substantial synthesis of fVIII make it a potentially attractive host for fVIII synthesis. Portal vein infusion of a suitable vector could deliver fVIII directly to LSECs. Alternatively, fVIII could be introduced into cultured LSECs ex vivo, followed by autologous transplantation. Subsequent expression of fVIII by transduced LSECs under physiological conditions, particularly with respect to regulatory control by vWf, could offer a superior approach to the management of hemophilia A.

The basolateral media were subjected to sequential density gradient ultracentrifugations to obtain large CM, small CM, and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and the distribution of apoB in these fractions was quantified. In the absence of OA, apoB was secreted as VLDL/LDL size particles. Addition of OA (≥0.8 mm)with TC, but not with albumin, resulted in the secretion of one-third of apoB as CM. Lipid analysis revealed that half of the secreted phospholipids (PL) and triglycerides (TG) were associated with CM. In CM, TG were 7–11-fold higher than PL indicating that CM were TG-rich particles. Secreted CM contained apoB100, apoB48, and other apolipoproteins. Secretion of large CM was specifically inhibited by Pluronic L81, a detergent known to inhibit CM secretion in animals. These studies demonstrate that differentiated Caco-2 cells assemble and secrete CM in a manner similar to enterocytes in vivo. Next, experiments were performed to identify the sources of lipids used for lipoprotein assembly. Cells were labeled with [3H]glycerol for 12 h, washed, and supplemented with OA, TC, and [14C] glycerol for various times to induce CM assembly and to radiolabel nascent lipids. TG and PL were extracted from cells and media and the association of preformed and nascent lipids with lipoproteins was determined. All the lipoproteins contained higher amounts of preformed PL compared with nascent PL. VLDL contained equal amounts of nascent and preformed TG, whereas CM contained higher amounts of nascent TG even when nascent TG constituted a small fraction of the total cellular pool. These studies indicate that nascent TG and preformed PL are preferentially used for CM assembly and provide a molecular explanation for the in vivo observations that the fatty acid composition of TG, but not PL, of secreted CM reflects the composition of dietary fat. It is proposed that in the intestinal cells the preformed PL from the endoplasmic reticulum bud off with apoB as primordial particles and the assembly of larger lipoproteins is dependent on the synthesis and delivery of nascent TG to these particles.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the assembly of these lipoproteins have not been elucidated mainly due to lack of cell culture models that secrete these particles. Caco-2, human colon carcinoma, cells have been used as a model to study intestinal lipid metabolisms (for reviews, see Refs. 1Levy E. Mehran M. Seidman E.

These cells secrete apoB-containing particles which have flotation properties similar to those of plasma LDL (reviewed in Ref. 1Levy E. Mehran M. Seidman E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, supplementation of Caco-2 cells with oleic acid (OA) has generally been shown to result in the secretion of more VLDL-sized particles and fewer LDL size particles but not chylomicrons (for review, see Ref. 1Levy E. Mehran M. Seidman E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 626-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The reasons for the lack of CM secretion are not known. One reason could be low levels of apoB48 synthesized by these cells. In contrast to enterocytes which mainly synthesize apoB48, Caco-2 cells mainly synthesize apoB100 (2Field F.J. Mathur S.N. Prog.

In a previous study, we showed that the inability of these cells to assemble CM was not due to limited synthesis of apoB48, since overexpression of apoB48 did not result in the secretion of chylomicrons (10Luchoomun J.

Furthermore, lipid absorption and transport were not impaired in mice expressing only apoB100 (11Farese Jr., R.V. Veniant M.M. Cham C.M. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Loring J.F. Traber M. Ruland S.

These studies indicated that lipid transport involving CM is a property of intestinal cells and is not totally dependent on apoB48 expression since apoB100 can substitute for this function. Thus, in the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the mode and amount of lipids delivered to intestinal cells may be limiting for the assembly and secretion of CM by Caco-2 cells. The hypothesis was based on the observation that intestinal cells synthesize VLDL or CM during fasting or postprandial states, respectively (13Ockner R.K. Hughes F.B. Isselbacher K.J. J. Clin.

Furthermore, synthesis of these two lipoproteins is affected differently during infusion of egg phosphatidylcholine, different amounts of oleic acid, and Pluronic L81 (15Tso P. Drake D.S. Black D.D.

Half of the cells from a 70–80% confluent 75-mm2 flask were divided into 12 Transwells (24 mm diameter, 3 μm pore size, Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and the medium was changed every other day for 21 days.

Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by overlaying ofd < 1.006 g/ml density solution was crucial for the reproducible separation of these lipoproteins from cell culture media. Analytical ultracentrifugation was preferred to light scattering or electron microscopy because rapidly floating units during centrifugation are more homogeneous (reviewed in Ref. 25Dole V.P. Hamlin III, J.T. Physiol. Rev. 1962; 42: 674-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To the conditioned media (4 ml) was added KBr (0.57 g) to obtain a density of 1.10 g/ml. The media was then overlaid with 3 ml each of 1.063 and 1.019 g/ml, and 2 ml of 1.006 g/ml density solutions using the Auto Density Flow (Buchler Instruments, Lenexa, KS) and subjected to sequential ultracentrifugation (24Karpe F. Hamsten A. Uffelman K. Steiner G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 263: 95-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain large CM (S f > 400), samples were ultracentrifuged (SW41 rotor, 33 min, 40,000 rpm, 15 °C) and the top 1 ml was collected. The samples in the ultracentrifuge tubes were then overlaid with 1 ml of d = 1.006 g/ml solution. Small CM (S f 60–400, 1 ml) were obtained from the top after a second ultracentrifugation (3 h and 28 min, 40,000 rpm, 15 °C). The top 1 ml was again replenished with d = 1.006 g/ml solution and ultracentrifuged for 17 h. The first 1-ml fraction collected from the top represented VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml, S f 20–60). The rest of the gradient was fractionated into additional seven 1.5-ml fractions. The fractions 2–4 and 5–7 were considered intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL (d = 1.02–1.063 g/ml) and high density lipoprotein/bottom (1.063–1.1 g/ml), respectively. ApoB was quantified in the conditioned media and in different density gradient fractions using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18Hussain M.M. Zhao Y. Kancha R.K. Blackhart B.D. Yao Z.

Lipids. 1997; 32: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) based on the binding of apoB to immobilized monoclonal antibody, 1D1, that recognizes an epitope in the N terminus (amino acids 474–539) of human apoB (26Milne R.W.

The recovery of apoB during ultracentrifugation ranged between 45 and 70% in earlier experiments when basolateral surfaces were exposed to serum-free media. In later experiments, addition of 0.1% FBS to serum-free conditioned media increased the recovery to 60–90% without affecting the distribution of apoB in different lipoprotein fractions. In all figures and tables, apoB (% of total secreted) present in VLDL, small CM, and large CM is shown. Differences in the amounts of apoB under various conditions were analyzed by Student's t test using Primer of Bio-statistics (McGraw-Hill Co., New York). Differentiated Caco-2 cells were radiolabeled under different conditions by placing [35S]Met/Cys radiolabeling mixture (150 μCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) in Cys/Met-free medium containing 20% FBS at the apical side. The basolateral side received Cys/Met- and serum-free medium. After overnight incubations, basolateral conditioned media were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation as described above. Apolipoproteins were precipitated from different fractions (28Mindham M.A. Mayes P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1084-1088PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, deoxycholate and trichloroacetic acid were added to the fractions at final concentrations of 0.7 mm and 1 m, respectively (28Mindham M.A. Mayes P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1084-1088PubMed Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, centrifuged, and proteins were resuspended in sample buffers by incubating at 80 °C for 10 min. Samples were applied to 3–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels, electrophoresed, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and individual bands were quantified. Cells were labeled with either [U-14C]glycerol (147.8 mCi/mmol) or [1,2,3-3H]glycerol (200 mCi/mmol). Lipids were extracted from cells or medium with isopropyl alcohol or chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v), respectively, and separated by thin layer chromatography on LK5D silica gels (Whatman) using petroleum ether:ethyl ether:acetic acid (90:10:1, v/v). After visualization with iodine vapor, lipid bands corresponding to triglycerides and phospholipids were scraped from the plates, and counted after adding 3 ml of scintillation fluid. To induce chylomicron secretion by Caco-2 cells, we added OA complexed with either BSA or TC (Table I). BSA is usually used for the delivery of fatty acids to cultured cells, whereas TC is present in the intestinal lumen. Both of these vehicles have been used to deliver fatty acids in different studies with Caco-2 cells (6Moberly J.B. Cole T.G. Schonfeld G. Biochim. Biophys.

Lower concentrations of TC were used because higher concentrations were reported to decrease apoB secretion in these cells (33Field F.J. Born E. Chen H.S. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 749-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we studied the effect of OA supplementation on total apoB secretion. Supplementation of OA with BSA or TC increased apoB secretion by ≈20% (Table I). The increase in apoB secretion was less pronounced than that observed in other studies (6Moberly J.B. Cole T.G.

Thus, OA supplemented with serum-containing media has a modest effect on total apoB secretion.Table IInduction of chylomicron secretion in differentiated Caco-2 cellsCompoundsApoB secretedApoB distribution in different lipoprotein fractionsLarge CMSmall CMVLDLmmng·ml−1·h−1% of total secretedBSA (3.15)4.8 ± 0.60.0 ± 0.60.0 ± 2.411.3 ± 1.1TC (0.5)4.7 ± 0.40.0 ± 0.30.0 ± 0.25.4 ± 0.9OA:BSA (0.8:3.15)5.9 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.716.9 ± 8.417.5 ± 2.5OA:TC (0.8:0.5)5.6 ± 0.89.9 ± 1.323.2 ± 2.023.6 ± 1.9Differentiated Caco-2 cells cultured in media containing 20% FBS were supplemented with either BSA or TC in the presence or absence of OA on the apical side for 12 h.

Distribution of apoB in larger lipoproteins is shown. The data is representative of four independent experiments. Next, we determined the distribution of apoB in different lipoprotein fractions. When cells were incubated with either BSA or TC in the absence of OA, no apoB was present in the large and small CM density fractions. However, 5–11% of apoB was in the VLDL fraction. Supplementation of OA as the BSA complex increased the amount of apoB secreted as VLDL to 18%. Furthermore, 17% of apoB was now associated with small CM. However, no apoB was in the large CM fraction. Supplementation of OA with TC resulted in a significant increase of apoB (23–24%) in VLDL and small CM. What is more important, 10% of apoB was now associated with large CM, and approximately 35% of the total secreted apoB was found associated with small and large CM. These studies indicated that OA and TC had modest effects on the amount of apoB secreted but had a profound effect on the secretion of apoB as CM. Next, we asked whether simultaneous incremental increases in OA and TC would increase the secretion of larger lipoproteins (TableII). Compared with TC-treated cells, inclusion of OA:TC up to 1.6:1.0 mm resulted in a ∼30–40% increase in apoB secretion. At OA:TC concentrations of 6.4:4.0 mm, total apoB secreted was significantly (≈60%) decreased most likely due to OA toxicity since 4.0 mm TC in the presence of 1.6 mm OA had no significant effect on apoB secretion (Fig. 1 B). Again, secretion of apoB as part of CM was dependent on the presence of OA (Table II). Maximum amounts of apoB in CM fractions were observed at OA:TC concentrations of 1.6:1.0 mm. Higher concentrations of OA:TC reduced the distribution of apoB into larger lipoproteins. In addition, we studied the chronic effect of OA supplementation on the secretion of apoB as CM. For this purpose, cells were exposed to OA:TC (1.6:0.5 mm) for 8 h. Next, they were fed with fresh media containing additional OA:TC and incubated for an additional 18 h. The percent of apoB secreted as CM was not affected by these treatments (data not shown, see also Fig.2 below) which indicated that up to one-third of the total secreted apoB could be secreted as small and large CM.Table IIEffect of different concentrations of TC and OA on the secretion of larger lipoproteins by differentiated Caco-2 cellsOA:TCApoB secretedApoB distribution in different lipoprotein fractionsLarge CMSmall CMVLDLmmng·ml−1·h−1% of total secreted0:0.54.0 ± 0.40.0 ± 0.41.4 ± 2.13.7 ± 1.00.4:0.255.5 ± 0.23.5 ± 0.414.0 ± 4.517.8 ± 6.70.8:0.55.2 ± 0.44.9 ± 1.019.1 ± 5.818.3 ± 5.51.6:1.05.3 ± 0.16.9 ± 1.321.8 ± 7.119.0 ± 6.33.2:2.04.1 ± 0.44.1 ± 2.821.4 ± 4.312.9 ± 2.76.4:4.01.7 ± 0.10.0 ± 0.91.7 ± 0.40.8 ± 3.1Differentiated Caco-2 cells were supplemented with different concentrations of TC and OA on the apical side for 12 h as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and Table I.

The basolateral media from two Transwells were pooled and subjected to ultracentrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amounts of apoB present in larger lipoproteins are shown. We then determined the optimum amounts of OA required for the assembly and secretion of CM (Fig. 1 A). Different concentrations of OA had differential effects on the secretion of apoB in VLDL, small CM, and large CM. Similar to results shown in Tables I and II, no apoB was observed in the large or small CM fractions in the conditioned media obtained from cells cultured in the absence of OA. However, 7% of apoB was associated with the VLDL fraction (Fig. 1 A). Addition of 0.4 mm OA resulted in a significant increase (≈15% each) in the secretion of apoB as VLDL and small CM. Again, no apoB was found associated with large CM. Increasing the concentration of OA to 0.8 mm resulted in further increases in the secretion of apoB in the small CM and VLDL fractions (≈20% each). Now, however, ≈6% of total apoB was recovered as large CM which reached a maximum of ≈8% at 1.6 mm OA. The effect of different concentrations of OA was similar to that observed in vivo (35Tso P. Lindstrom M.B. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In rats, secretion of VLDL was saturated at OA infusion rates of 60 μmol/h whereas infusion of higher amounts of OA (≥60 μmol/h) increased CM secretion (35Tso P. Lindstrom M.B. Borgstrom B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 922: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that ≥0.8 mm OA was required for the secretion of large CM by differentiated Caco-2 cells. The importance of TC in the secretion of CM was then studied by incubating Caco-2 cells with a constant amount of OA (1.6 mm) and different concentrations of TC (Fig.1 B). Total apoB secreted was not affected by increasing concentrations of TC (data not shown). Similarly, higher concentrations of TC had no additional effect on the secretion of apoB in large CM, small CM, or VLDL fractions (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the secretion of larger lipoproteins was not enhanced by higher TC concentrations. The studies described above indicated that OA induces secretion of CM in differentiated Caco-2 cells. Next, we asked whether other fatty acids would further enhance the secretion of CM. For this purpose, cells were incubated with OA:TC and different fatty acids as described in Table III. Different fatty acids did not significantly increase total apoB secretion. Furthermore, palmitic and linoleic acids had no additional stimulatory effect on the secretion of lipoproteins by these cells.Table IIIEffect of different fatty acids on the secretion of lipoproteins in differentiated Caco-2 cellsFatty acidsApoB secretedApoB distribution in different fractionsLarge CMSmall CMVLDLmmng·ml−1·h−1% of total secretedOleic acid (1.6)5.97 ± 0.197.9 ± 0.526.9 ± 2.527.6 ± 1.2Oleic and palmitic acids (0.8 + 0.8)5.81 ± 0.316.7 ± 0.828.9 ± 1.929.7 ± 0.8Oleic and linoleic acids (0.8 + 0.8)6.33 ± 0.425.7 ± 1.625.7 ± 1.124.8 ± 0.4Oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids (0.8 + 0.4 + 0.4)5.71 ± 0.326.6 ± 0.725.3 ± 0.326.7 ± 1.6Culture media of differentiated Caco-2 cells were supplemented with different fatty acids in the presence of 0.5 mm TC on the apical side for 14 h.

https://openalex.org/W1576154026,"Inherited retinal diseases are a common cause of visual impairment in children and young adults, often resulting in severe loss of vision in later life. The most frequent form of inherited retinopathy is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), with an approximate incidence of 1 in 3,500 individuals worldwide1,2. RP is characterized by night blindness and progressive degeneration of the midperipheral retina, accompanied by bone spicule-like pigmentary deposits and a reduced or absent electroretinogram (ERG). The disease process culminates in severe reduction of visual fields or blindness. RP is genetically heterogeneous, with autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked forms. Here we have identified two mutations in a novel retina-specific gene from chromosome 8q that cause the RP1 form of autosomal dominant RP in three unrelated families. The protein encoded by this gene is 2,156 amino acids and its function is currently unknown, although the amino terminus has similarity to that of the doublecortin protein, whose gene (DCX) has been implicated in lissencephaly in humans17. Two families have a nonsense mutation in codon 677 of this gene (Arg677stop), whereas the third family has a nonsense mutation in codon 679 (Gln679stop). In one family, two individuals homozygous for the mutant gene have more severe retinal disease compared with heterozygotes."

Three subgroups of the MAPK superfamily have been clearly identified: the extracellularly responsive kinases (p42/44MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2); the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p46/54JNK), which are also known as the stress-activated protein kinases; and the p38MAPK (also known as RK, Mxi-2, CSBP1/2, or HOG-1-related kinases). Although the MAPK families are structurally related, they are generally activated by distinct extracellular stimuli through distinct upstream dual specificity kinases, thus comprising a series of separate MAPK cascades (5Davis R.J.

No physiological role has been associated with the difference in substrate affinity of the JNKs or p38MAPK.

Since specific inhibitors of the p42/44MAPK and p38MAPK cascades were first described, they have been widely used to investigate their involvement in intracellular signal transduction pathways. The flavone compound 2-(2′-amino-3′-methoxyphenyl)oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD98059) is a specific inhibitor of the mammalian MEK-1/2 and has been used extensively for investigating the physiological function of p42/44MAPK (34Pang L.

Analysis of the signal transduction pathways using the above inhibitors revealed a critical role of p42/44MAPK activation during induction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene expression by a variety of extracellular stimuli (43Kumar A.

In this paper, we have directly addressed the physiological role of p38MAPK in the regulation of LDL receptor expression by using highly specific pharmacological and molecular tools. Results presented demonstrate that simple inhibition of the p38MAPK basal activity is sufficient to induce LDL receptor expression in a p42/44MAPK-dependent manner. Co-transfection studies established that SB202190-induced LDL receptor expression is mediated by the activation of p42/44MAPK resulting from the inhibition of p38MAPK α-isoform. Therefore, in intact cells, p38MAPK α-isoform negatively regulates p42/44MAPK and the responses mediated by this kinase. We speculate that cross-talk between these MAPKs, which mediate the effects of numerous extracellular stimuli, could be crucial for controlling a wide array of biological processes.

Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 10% acrylamide separation gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and processed as described previously (43Kumar A.

Briefly, membranes were incubated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mmNaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (Tris/NaCl/Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk for 1 h, washed in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 (3 × 5 min), and incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20 containing 1% milk at room temperature for nonphosphospecific antibodies and overnight at 4 °C for phosphospecific antibodies. The following dilutions were used for individual antibodies against different proteins: p42/44MAPK (1:1600); phospho-p42/44MAPK(1:1000); phospho-p46/54JNK (1:1000); phospho-p38MAPK (1:1600); phospho-MEK-1/2 (1:1000); MAPK phosphatase-1 (1:1500). After further washing in Tris/NaCl/Tween 20, membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-IgG secondary antibody (Bio-Rad; diluted 1:5000), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by ECL as described by the supplier. Quantitative analyses of protein levels were performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms and are representative of three or more independent experiments. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol, and Northern blotting was done essentially as described earlier (43Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, 20 μg of total cellular RNA was fractionated on 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Zeta Probe membrane by capillary blotting. RNA blots were hybridized with LDL receptor and squalene synthase-specific single-stranded M13 probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. In most cases, the same blot was rehybridized with 32P-labeled single-stranded M13 probe specific for β-actin. Hybridized filters were washed and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. The relative intensities of specific bands were determined densitometrically within the linear range of the film on a model 300A laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) with ImageQuant software. LDL receptor mRNA was normalized to either squalene synthase or β-actin mRNA level, and data for each point were plotted as the percentage of LDL receptor mRNA as compared with controls. Expression vectors of MKK6b (wild type), MKK6b(E) (a constitutive mutant of MKK6b in which serine 207 and threonine 211 are replaced with glutamic acid), MKK6b(A) (a dominant negative mutant of MKK6b in which lysine 82 is replaced with alanine), p38MAPK α, p38MAPKα(AF) (a double mutant of p38MAPK α-isoform in which threonine 188 and tyrosine 190 are substituted with phenylalanine), and p38MAPK βII have been described elsewhere (19Huang S.

Reporter gene of LDL receptor promoter-luciferase (plasmid A), in which the 5′-flanking region of human LDL receptor promoter was fused to firefly luciferase gene, has also been described previously (46Mehta K.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33616-33622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).2 HepG2 cells were transfected by the Lipofectamine method. For transfection experiments, HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells of six-well plate 1 day in advance. Transfections were performed in duplicate with 0.75 μg of DNA for plasmid A and the indicated amounts of the relevant expression vector or the corresponding empty vector (46Mehta K.D. Chang R. Underwood J. Wise J. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33616-33622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).2 After 5 h, the cells were washed with basic medium and refed with Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 12–16 h later, transfected cells were switched to medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for an additional 8 h. Finally, dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with luciferase lysis buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). Luciferase activity was measured according to the TROPIX protocol. Data are representative for at least four independent experiments performed in duplicate and are expressed as -fold increase in luciferase activity, which was calculated relative to the basal level of LDL receptor promoter reporter activity (set to 1 unit) and corrected for empty vector effects for each expression vector. To test whether the p38MAPK is involved in the regulation of LDL receptor expression, we examined first the effects of inhibition of this kinase by using a specific inhibitor. The activity of p38MAPK was inhibited by using SB202190, a highly selective inhibitor of p38MAPK that does not affect the activity of other relevant kinases even at high concentrations. HepG2 cells were treated with SB202190 for various times, and the effect on LDL receptor expression was measured by Northern blotting. SB202190 induces LDL receptor expression in a time-dependent manner without significantly affecting expression of a housekeeping actin gene or another sterol-sensitive gene of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, squalene synthase (SS, Fig. 1). A significant increase in LDL receptor expression was apparent at 4 h, and a plateau was reached after an 8-h treatment of SB202190. Another specific p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 also induced LDL receptor expression, whereas the inactive derivative SB202474 had no effect on LDL receptor expression (data not shown). The most effective concentrations were 2.5 μm for SB202190 and 10 μm for SB203580. Because LDL receptor is negatively regulated by sterols, we then tested whether SB202190 can induce LDL receptor expression in the presence of sterols. As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of sterols suppressed SB202190-induced LDL receptor expression. However, a slight increase in the suppressed levels of LDL receptor was observed in a dose-dependent manner upon treatment with SB202190. Because pyridinyl imidazoles that are closely related to SB203580 have cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity (47Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F. Um S.L. Borsch-Haubold A.G. Watson S.P. Fisher M.J.

White J.R. Young P.R. Bender P.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 149-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), experiments were conducted to determine whether blockade of this activity with indomethacin (49Vane J.R. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (7367) Google Scholar) can alter LDL receptor expression. Importantly, unlike SB202190, up to 20 μm indomethacin did not significantly alter LDL receptor expression (results not shown). From the above data, it seemed probable that the effect of SB202190 on LDL receptor expression is related to its inhibition of p38MAPK. To investigate the role of the p38MAPKsignaling pathway in the regulation of LDL receptor expression more directly, we used previously characterized expression constructs to modulate either positively or negatively the endogenous p38MAPK activity. LDL receptor transcription was monitored by transfecting HepG2 cells with a previously cloned fragment of the human LDL receptor promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (46Mehta K.D. Chang R. Underwood J. Wise J. Kumar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33616-33622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), together with the relevant constructs. In several cell systems, p38MAPK activity can be stimulated by coexpression of p38MAPK with MKK6b or by expression of constitutively activated MKK6b(E), in which the activating phosphorylation residues Ser207 and Thr211 were replaced by glutamic acids (19Huang S. Jiang Y. Li Z. Nishida E. Mathias P. Lin S. Ulevitch R.J. Nemerow G.R. Han J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 50Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Expression of MKK6b(E) reduced luciferase gene expression at least 3-fold, when compared with the luciferase expression in control cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig.3). Conversely, expression of the dominant negative regulatory MKK6b(A) construct slightly increased LDL receptor-luciferase expression, correlating with a partial inhibition of endogenous MKK6b activity in cells expressing this mutated form of MKK6b. To rule out the possibility that MKK6b(E) may suppress LDL receptor promoter activity in a p38MAPK-independent manner, we tested whether MKK6b(E)-inhibited LDL receptor expression is due to activation of p38MAPK. HepG2 cells were transfected with the human LDL receptor promoter-luciferase reporter gene along with the expression vectors encoding p38MAPK α-isoform, p38MAPK βII-isoform, MKK6b, or empty vector. It is interesting to note that expression of either the p38MAPKα-isoform or MKK6b was able to suppress reporter gene expression mildly. However, coexpression of the p38MAPK α-isoform and MKK6b together strongly reduced luciferase activity 6-fold (Fig.3). The effect of MKK6b is dependent on p38MAPK α-isoform activation, since MKK6b failed to stimulate reporter gene activity when it was co-transfected with an inactive p38MAPK α(AF) mutant, in which one of the activating phosphorylation residues, Tyr182, was replaced by phenylalanine. At the same time, expression of the p38MAPK βII-isoform either alone or together with MKK6b had no significant effect on LDL receptor promoter activity. These results demonstrate that activation of the p38MAPK by itself is sufficient to suppress LDL receptor gene expression. In addition, we conclude that it is the p38MAPK α-isoform, and not the p38MAPKβII-isoform, that mediates SB202190-induced LDL receptor expression. Since p42/44MAPK have been found to play an important role during induction of LDL receptor gene expression (43Kumar A. Middleton A. Chambers T.C. Mehta K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15742-15748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 44Kumar A. Chambers T.C. Cloud-Heflin B.A. Mehta K.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 4220-4228Google Scholar),2 we initially determined whether the inhibition of p38MAPK by SB202190 leads to the activation of other MAPKs. HepG2 cells were incubated with SB202190, and the activities of the p42/44MAPK and p46/54JNK were determined by immunoblot analysis with antibodies that recognized the activated phosphorylated forms of the these kinases in cell extracts obtained at different times. In contrast to the rapid and transient growth factor-induced activation of p42/44MAPK,2SB202190 treatment caused a delayed and prolonged activation with no effect on p42/44MAPK or MKP-1 protein levels in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4 A). Weak activation was observed at 4 h, and maximal induction was obtained approximately 8 h following stimulation. The activated p42/44MAPKremained elevated at least until 24 h, the maximum time point measured. Furthermore, changes in p42/44MAPKphosphorylation took place with little or no effect on the phosphorylation (Fig. 4 A) or expression levels of p46/54JNK (data not shown). Kinetics of MEK-1/2 phosphorylation paralleled an increase in p42/44MAPKphosphorylation, suggesting that MEK-1/2 is also activated upon SB202190 treatment. Because MEK-1/2 directly phosphorylates and activates p42/44MAPK, PD98059 was used to determine the role of this pathway in SB202190-induced LDL receptor expression. Inhibition of SB202190-induced LDL receptor expression by PD98059 (Fig.4 B) suggests that the induction of LDL receptor expression is mediated by the p42/44MAPK signaling pathway. The lack of signficant effect of sterols on SB202190-induced p42/44MAPK phosphorylation ruled out involvement of a sterol-sensitive step in p42/44MAPK activation (Fig.4 C). Overall, the above results suggested that p38MAPK negatively regulates p42/44MAPKphosphorylation and that SB202190-dependent increase in LDL receptor ex"

NO is catalytically produced by different NO synthase isoforms that convertl-arginine to NO and stoichiometric amounts of citrulline (1Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4157) Google Scholar, 3Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, NO synthase isoforms produce not only NO, the primary reaction product, but also those species that are derived from oxidation, reduction, or adduction of NO in physiological milieus, including S-nitrosothiols, peroxynitrite, and transition metal adducts (4Brüne B. Messmer U.K. Sandau K. Toxicol. Lett. 1995; 82–83: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 5Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Constitutive versus inducible isozymes account for low versus high level NO output systems and allow a rough correspondence between toxic and homeostatic functions of the molecule (6Nüssler A.K. Billiar T.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Cytostatic and/or toxic actions of NO may play important roles in the pathology of tissue or cell destruction (7Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that NO-induced cell death is, at least in part, mediated via apoptosis. Treatment of cells with NO donors or activation of inducible NO synthase resulted in apoptotic alterations in several cell culture systems (8Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar, 9Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Sarih M. Souvannavong V. Adam A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NO-induced apoptosis was reported to involve activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, activation of caspases, and altered expression of Bcl-2 family members (11Messmer U.K. Reimer D.M. Reed J.C. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Levine A.J.

For RAW 264.7 macrophages, accumulation of the p53 protein resembled an early apoptotic marker, and p53 antisense experiments suggested that, in this cellular system, NO-induced apoptosis is at least partially dependent on p53 (15Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which NO induces p53 accumulation remained unclear. Under normal growth conditions, wild-type p53 is rapidly degraded, which probably is required to tightly control its growth-suppressive properties (16Brown J.P. Pagano M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: O1-O6PubMed Google Scholar). In response to a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage, hypoxia, or ribonucleotide depletion, p53 can be activated, which generally results in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of the affected cells (17Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Concomitant with its activation, intracellular p53 levels increase significantly, and it is commonly assumed that p53 levels, at least in part, are regulated by the rate of degradation. There is increasing evidence that the ubiquitin/proteasome system (18Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 19Spataro V. Norbury C. Harris A.L. Br. J.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) plays a major role in p53 degradation (21Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in support of the notion that up-regulation of p53 is important for the activation of its growth-suppressive properties, it was reported that treatment of cells with proteasome-specific inhibitors induces both p53 accumulation and apoptosis (26Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 27Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, since inhibition of the proteasome evoked apoptosis also in p53-negative HL-60 cells, inhibition of the proteasome can result in the induction of p53-dependent as well as of p53-independent apoptotic pathways (26Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Since initiation of NO-induced apoptosis and p53 accumulation are closely associated and since NO affects the activity of various proteins (28Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3895-3900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we put the hypothesis forward that NO directly blocks the activity of the proteasome, which in turn results in an increase in p53 levels. Therefore, we analyzed p53 accumulation in response to specific proteasome inhibitors and NO donors in vivo and measured the effect of NO on proteasome-mediated degradation of an artificial peptide substrate and of polyubiquitinated p53 in vitro. This revealed that, similar to proteasome inhibitors, NO directly interferes with proteasome activity, indicating that NO, at least in part, affects intracellular signaling pathways by blocking proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Diphenylamine, MG-132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal), MG-115 (benzyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norvaline), E-64, 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine sodium,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, and LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0127:B8) were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC was from Bachem Biochemica (Heidelberg, Germany). The NO synthase inhibitorl-NAME was from Alexis (Grünberg, Germany). Recombinant murine IFN-γ, ATP, and ATPγS were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Clastolactacystin-β-lactone was from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany).N-(2-Aminoethyl)-N-(2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino)-1,2-ethylenediamine was obtained from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany). The mouse monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete RPMI 1640 medium). All experiments were performed using complete RPMI 1640 medium. GSNO was dissolved in water. The fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC, MG-132, MG-115, and clastolactacystin-β-lactone were dissolved in Me2SO. E-64 was dissolved in water/ethanol (1:1, v/v), and calpain inhibitor II was dissolved in ethanol. The various reagents were added to complete RPMI 1640 medium as indicated. For all experiments, appropriate solvent control experiments were performed. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet-40, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0), followed by sonication (Branson sonifier; 20 s, 100% duty cycle, 60% output control). After centrifugation (14,000 × g, 5 min), proteins (100 μg) were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. Equal loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. To detect p53, filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the p53-specific monoclonal antibody clone PAb 122 (hybridoma supernatant, kindly provided by Prof. Dr. H. Stahl, Homburg/Saar, Germany), followed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). DNA fragmentation was measured with the diphenylamine assay as reported (32McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped off the culture plates; resuspended in 250 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (TE buffer); and lysed by the addition of 250 μl of buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. Intact chromatin (pellet) was then separated from DNA fragments (supernatant) by centrifugation for 15 min at 13,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of TE buffer, and samples were precipitated overnight at 4 °C by adding 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. DNA was pelleted by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min), and the supernatant was discarded. After the addition of 300 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid, samples were boiled for 15 min. DNA contents were quantitated using diphenylamine (33Burton K. Biochem. J. 1956; 62: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (10845) Google Scholar). The percentage of fragmented DNA was calculated as the ratio of the DNA content in the supernatant to the DNA content in the pellet. Fluorescence-based determination of proteasome activity was performed as described (34Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with GSNO, MG-132, LPS/IFN-γ, E-64, and clastolactacystin-β-lactone, respectively, or with the respective solvents as a control. Upon treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the protein extracts were prepared in 100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, and 0.1% CHAPS. Then, 50 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC (dissolved in 10% Me2SO) was incubated with the respective protein extract (100 μg) in 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgOAc in a total volume of 200 μl. After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 9.0, in ethanol/water (144:16). Degradation of the fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC was assessed by measuring the fluorescence of aminomethylcoumarin at 460 nm (excitation at 365 nm) using a SpectraFluor fluorometer (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). Results are the means ± S.D. (two-tailed Student's t test) of five independent experiments. Human wild-type p53 was generated by in vitrotranscription-translation in wheat germ extract (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a source of the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein, E6 was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli DH5α and purified as described (35Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). E6-AP was expressed and prepared from Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding E6-AP as described (35Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH7 were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the pET expression system as described previously (36Nuber U. Schwarz S. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2795-2800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To generate polyubiquitinated p53, 1 μl of in vitrotranslated p53 was incubated in the presence of ∼10 ng of purified baculovirus-expressed E6-AP, 10 ng of glutathioneS-transferase-E6 fusion protein, 50 ng of E1, 50 ng of UbcH7, and 6 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) in 20-μl volumes. In addition, reactions contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP or 2 mm ATPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as indicated, 4 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 90 min at 25 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of an SDS-containing buffer. Alternatively, proteasome-mediated degradation of polyubiquitinated p53 was measured by adding 60 μl of a mixture containing 7 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 4 mm ATP, and 8 mm MgCl2 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 50 mm NaCl. Upon further incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, the total reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and35S-labeled p53 was detected by fluorography. Where indicated, rabbit reticulocyte lysate was incubated for 15 min with the respective NO donor prior to addition to polyubiquitinated p53. To address the possibility that accumulation of p53 in RAW 264.7 macrophages upon NO treatment is linked to inactivation of the proteasome, we initially corroborated the observation that p53 protein accumulates in these cells in response to the NO donor GSNO (9Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 37Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar,38Messmer U.K. Lapetina E.G. Brüne B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 757-765PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of cells with GSNO resulted in a significant increase in p53 levels within 2 h after its addition. After 4 h, p53 levels reached a plateau, whereas in unstimulated cells no or very little p53 was detected. Previous studies established that treatment of cells with a combination of LPS and IFN-γ promotes endogenous NO formation that causes p53 accumulation and apoptosis, whereas inhibitors of inducible NO synthase, such as l-NAME, preserve cell integrity by blocking NO formation and thus p53 accumulation and apoptosis (37Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). To test whether GSNO treatment also results in apoptosis, we performed quantitative DNA fragmentation analysis using the diphenylamine assay (Table I). Indeed, in response to 1 mm GSNO, we observed significant endonuclease-mediated DNA damage in RAW 264.7 macrophages after 8 h. These results underscore the ability of NO to promote apoptotic cell death and further support the notion that p53 accumulation represents an early marker for cell death in this cellular system.Table IDNA fragmentation in RAW 264.7 macrophagesTreatment (8 h)DNA fragmentation%Me2SO (0.1%)5.6 ± 2.2GSNO (1 mm)25.3 ± 2.5ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).MG-1155 μm16.9 ± 2.9ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).50 μm24.4 ± 2.2ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).100 μm25.7 ± 5.0ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).MG-1320.1 μm7.8 ± 1.01 μm18.3 ± 1.9ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).10 μm22.1 ± 2.6ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).Clastolactacystin-β-lactone1 μm28.3 ± 2.1ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).5 μm54.6 ± 4.4ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).10 μm62.8 ± 4.5ap < 0.05 relative to 0.1% Me2SO-treated control RAW 264.7 macrophages (by Student'st test).Calpain inhibitor II (50 μm)3.7 ± 2.1E-64 (50 μm)5.0 ± 1.0Cells (5 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates in the absence or presence of GSNO or various protease inhibitors as indicated.

After 8 h, cells were lysed, and DNA fragmentation was quantitatively assessed by the diphenylamine method (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data are the means ± S.D. of three different independent experiments. Inhibition of proteasome activity has been linked to p53 accumulation and initiation of apoptosis in various experimental systems (27Lopes U.G. Erhardt P. Yao R. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12893-12896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 39Shinohara K. Tomioka M. Nakano H. Tone S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To study the effect of proteasome inhibitors on p53 expression in macrophages, we exposed RAW 264.7 cells to several established proteasome-blocking agents (Fig.2, A and B). As expected, inhibitors such as MG-132 and MG-115 dose-dependently promoted p53 accumulation, with maximal responses at 10 μm MG-132 and 50 μm MG-115 (Fig. 2 A). We went on to analyze the effect of proteasome inhibitors on DNA fragmentation (Table I). MG-132 and MG-115 dose-dependently initiated DNA cleavage as determined by the diphenylamine assay. Similar to p53 accumulation, DNA degradation was most efficiently achieved with 50 μm MG-115 and 10 μmMG-132. At these concentrations, we noted ∼25% DNA fragmentation, which is similar to the response elicited by 1 mm GSNO. Fragmentation values of unstimulated controls consistently were ∼5%. The notion that inhibition of proteasome activity induces apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells was further supported by the use of the proteasome-specific inhibitor clastolactacystin-β-lactone (40Fenteany G. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and, as a control, by the use of calpain inhibitor II or E-64, a nonspecific cysteine protease inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 2 B, clastolactacystin-β-lactone led to p53 accumulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. In contrast, E-64 and calpain inhibitor II at commonly used concentrations failed to induce p53 accumulation, thus pointing to the unique role of the proteasome system in p53 degradation. Moreover, the addition of clastolactacystin-β-lactone resulted in apoptosis of the treated cells as measured by DNA fragmentation, although a similar effect was not observed for calpain inhibitor II and E-64 (Table I). Taken together, these data demonstrate that, similar to NO, inhibition of the proteasome results in p53 accumulation and apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages, indicating that protein degradation plays an important role in the regulation of programmed cell death of macrophages. To determine whether NO has a direct effect on proteasome activity, we analyzed the ability of cell extracts to degrade the fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC (41Reinheckel T. Sitte N. Ullrich O. Kuckelkorn U. Davies K.J.A. Grune T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), which was reported to be a preferred substrate of the 20 S proteasome (34Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15504-15509Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,42Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 43Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Chen W.E. Li J. Johdo O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16455-16459Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteolytic degradation of Suc-LLVY-AMC releases the fluorescent aminomethylcoumarin portion that serves as an indicator of proteolytic activity. Exposure of RAW 264.7 macrophages for 4 h to 1 mm GSNO resulted in a reduction of proteasome activity by ∼70% (Fig.3), whereas treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and clastolactacystin-β-lactone blocked the formation of aminomethylcoumarin almost completely. In contrast, treatment with the nonspecific cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 did not alter the efficiency of Suc-LLVY-AMC degradation. To test whether endogenously produced NO interferes with proteasome activity, RAW 264.7 macrophages were treated with LPS/IFN-γ. After 24 h, cell extracts were prepared, and their ability to degrade Suc-LLVY-AMC was determined. This revealed that LPS/IFN-γ treatment blocked peptide cleavage by ∼40% compared with cell extracts derived from untreated control cells (Fig. 3). Furthermore, this effect was not observed in the additional presence of l-NAME (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the observed reduction in proteasome activity was due to endogenous NO production. Based on these results and the fact that degradation of the fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC does not require ubiquitination prior to degradation, we conclude that endogenously produced NO or exogenously supplied NO directly inhibits the catalytic activity of the 20 S proteasome. Unlike degradation of peptides by the 20 S proteasome, 26 S proteasome-mediated degradation is ATP-dependent, and in addition, most natural substrates of the 26 S proteasome, including p53, need to be modified by the covalent attachment of multiple moieties of ubiquitin prior to their recognition as proteolytic substrates (18Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 21Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M.

Similarly, it was previously shown that the HPV-16 E6 oncoprotein targets p53 for degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome system. In this system, E6 recruits the ubiquitin-protein ligase E6-AP to p53, resulting in the formation of polyubiquitinated forms of p53 (35Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitinated p53 is then recognized by the 26 S proteasome and degraded. Although the E6-facilitated ubiquitination/degradation of p53 is not of physiological relevance with respect to HPV-negative cells, including RAW 264.7 macrophages, this system may be suitable to directly assess the effect of NO on the ability of the 26 S proteasome to degrade polyubiquitinated proteins. To test this possibility, polyubiquitinated p53 was generated in the presence of E6, E6-AP, and the basic components of the ubiquitin conjugation system (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and4). Then, as a source of the 26 S proteasome, rabbit reticulocyte lysate was added in the presence of ATP or ATPγS, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog that cannot be used as an energy source by the 26 S proteasome. As expected, in the presence of ATP, polyubiquitinated p53 was efficiently degraded (Fig. 4 A,lane 5). In contrast, degradation was not observed in the presence of ATPγS, showing that degradation in this system is mediated by the 26 S proteasome. The accumulation of unmodified forms of p53 in the presence of both ATPγS and rabbit reticulocyte lysate is most likely explained by the notion that polyubiquitinated forms of p53 are converted into unmodified forms of p53 by de-ubiquitinating enzymes that are present in reticulocyte lysate. Having shown that polyubiquitinated p53 represents an efficient substrate for the 26 S proteasome in vitro, we then analyzed the effect of GSNO on proteasome activity in this system (Fig.4 B). This revealed that treatment of reticulocyte lysate with GSNO inhibits p53 degradation (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5). The inhibitory effect of NO was almost maximal at 0.5 mm GSNO, whereas at 200 μmGSNO, degradation of p53 was not significantly affected (data not shown). Furthermore, NO-induced inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation resulted in the accumulation of unmodified p53, indicating that, under the conditions used, the activity of de-ubiquitinating enzymes is not significantly affected by GSNO. In this context, it should be noted that, probably due to the presence of an apparently high p53 de-ubiquitinating activity in RAW 264.7 cell extracts, it was not possible to test if NO treatment had a direct effect on the 26 S proteasome in RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). Finally, to establish inhibition of the proteasome system by NO donors irrespective of the chemical structure of the individual NO-delivering compounds, we tested NO donors such as 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitroso-hydrazine sodium,N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazino)-1,2-ethylenediamine, and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (Fig. 5). All NO donors blocked p53 degradation with a similar efficiency. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that, at least in vitro, NO interferes with p53 degradation by direct inhibition of the 26 S proteasome. The growth-suppressive properties of p53 can be activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including DNA damage. Activation of p53 generally results in growth arrest or in apoptosis of the affected cells, and with respect to DNA damage, it is commonly believed that p53 activation contributes to prevent the propagation of cells that acquired genomic mutations (12Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6740) Google Scholar, 17Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol.

Concomitant with its activation, intracellular p53 levels increase significantly, and there is strong evidence that p53 levels, at least in part, are regulated by its turnover rate. Similarly, the action of endogenous or exogenous NO to initiate apoptosis has been linked to p53 accumulation by several independent studies (37Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 44Ambs S. Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 45Fehsel K.

Pharmacol. 1996; 317: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) of NO-induced p53 accumulation remained elusive. In this study, we obtained evidence that NO can directly inhibit the activity of the 20 S proteasome as well as that of the 26 S proteasome. Since p53 was shown to be a substrate of the ubiquitin/proteasome system (21Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 22Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar, 24Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 229-302Crossref Scopus (2847) Google Scholar), this provides a likely mechanism for NO-induced p53 accumulation. This possibility is further supported by the finding that specific proteasome inhibitors led to p53 accumulation and apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages with an efficiency similar to NO-releasing compounds. The observation that cleavage of Suc-LLVY-AMC was significantly decreased in extracts derived from cells treated with NO donors suggests that NO directly interferes with the proteolytic activity of the 20 S proteasome. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the proteolytic activity of the 26 S proteasome is inhibited by NO treatment in vitro as shown by the inability of NO-treated reticulocyte lysate to degrade polyubiquitinated p53 (Figs. 4 and 5). For several enzymes, it has been established that, in response to NO, their activity is inhibited by covalent modification of thiol groups (28Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Dimmeler S. Haendeler J. Nehls M. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp.

A. 1996; 93: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This appears to be also a likely mechanism for NO-induced proteasome inhibition since modification of thiol groups is considered to inhibit proteasome activity (49Savory P.J. Rivett A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 289: 45-48Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Besides inhibition of the proteasome, it seems possible that NO interferes also with the activity of the ubiquitin conjugation system since E6/E6-AP-mediated ubiquitination of p53 was completely inhibited in the presence of NO donors (data not shown). However, at present, it is unclear if the presence of NO interferes with binding of the E6·E6-AP complex to p53 (which is a prerequisite step for p53 ubiquitination) or with the activities of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that are involved in p53 ubiquitination in this particular system. This possibility was not further addressed since E6·E6-AP-mediated p53 ubiquitination is not of physiological relevance for p53 degradation in RAW 264.7 cells. In this context, it will be interesting to see if NO also interferes with Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 since Mdm2 seems to be involved in p53 degradation in normal (i.e. HPV-negative) cells (23Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3720) Google Scholar, 24Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 229-302Crossref Scopus (2847) Google Scholar, 25Bottger A. Bottger V. Sparks A. Liu W.L. Howard S.F. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 860-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 macrophages have been shown to produce NO via inducible NO synthase in response to LPS/IFN-γ treatment (37Messmer U.K. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Brüne B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 50Kim Y.M. Lee B.S. Yi K.Y. Paik S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 51Le Page C. Sanceau J. Drapier J.C. Wietzerbin J. Immunology. 1996; 89: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since treatment with LPS/IFN-γ also resulted in decreased proteasome activity, this indicates that NO is indeed a natural negative regulator of the proteasome. This is further supported by the finding that the effect of LPS/IFN-γ cannot be observed in the additional presence ofl-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase. Since the ubiquitin/proteasome system is a major pathway for the degradation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins, this may indicate that the half-lives of many cytosolic and nuclear proteins increase upon NO treatment. Alternatively, it seems possible that the breakdown of distinct substrates of the proteasome such as p53 may be more sensitive to proteasome inhibition than the bulk of short-lived proteins. However, additional experiments will be required to address this possibility. Since inhibition of the proteasome by NO most likely does not affect only p53 stability, it seems possible that also the turnover of other important regulators of apoptosis and/or components of the cell cycle machinery are influenced by NO. For instance, our data may provide an explanation for the recently published observation that NO blocks NF-κB activation (28Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 31Sekkai D. Aillet F. Israel N. Lepoivre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3895-3900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since NF-κB activation requires proteolytic digestion of the inhibitor IκB, inhibition of proteasome activity by NO should inhibit IκB degradation and thus activation of NF-κB. Another example may be the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which was recently shown to be degraded by the proteasome (52Chang Y.C. Lee Y.S. Tejima T. Tanaka K. Omura S. Heintz N.H. Mitsui Y. Magae J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of NO-induced programmed cell death, the amount of Bax is up-regulated (53Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 54Sandau K. Pfeilschifter J. Brüne B. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 378-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), either as a result of p53 accumulation, which is known to operate as an inducer of bax gene expression, or as a consequence of NO-mediated proteasome inhibition. Since NO initiates apoptosis in p53-negative cells as well (55Brockhaus F. Brüne B. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), our proposal that NO inhibits proteasome function provides a reasonable explanation for the fact that NO can induce apoptosis irrespective of the cellular p53 status. Finally, the influence of endogenously generated NO on proteasome activity may further highlight the role of NO during immune suppression if one considers the essential role of the proteasome in antigen presentation (56Lopez D. Del Val M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5769-5772PubMed Google Scholar, 57Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6373-6379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). With a few exceptions, it appeared that dividing cells responded to proteasome inhibitors by activation of apoptosis, whereas in nondividing cells, the same inhibitors revealed anti-apoptotic effects (58Meriin A.B.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6373-6379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), indicating that the individual effect of proteasome inhibitors is determined by the proliferative status of a cell. Interestingly, the ability of NO to initiate apoptosis is also divergent. Although NO formation causes apoptosis in multiple systems (46Muhl H. Sandau K. Brüne B. Briner V.A. Pfeilschifter J. Eur.

It will be challenging to determine whether, with respect to apoptosis and cell survival, the individual response of cells to NO is reflected in the different response of cells to inhibition of the proteasome.

Several transcription factors have been reported to be regulated by p38/SAPK2, and this kinase is involved in the control of expression of various genes. In human Jurkat T-cells, induction of the early growth response gene-1 (egr-1) by anisomycin is completely inhibited by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38/SAPK2a and -b. Northern blot and reporter gene experiments indicate that this block is at the level of mRNA biosynthesis. Using mutants of the egr-1 promoter, we demonstrate that a distal cAMP-responsive element (CRE; nucleotides −134 to −126) is necessary to control egr-1 induction by p38/SAPK2. Pull-down assays indicate that phospho-CRE binding protein (CREB) and phospho-activating transcription factor-1 (ATF1) bind to this element in a p38/SAPK2-dependent manner. In response to anisomycin, two known CREB kinases downstream to p38/SAPK2, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2) and mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1), show increased activity. However, in MK2 −/− fibroblasts derived from mice carrying a disruption of the MK2gene, the phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 and the expression of egr-1 reach levels comparable with wild type cells. This finding excludes MK2 as an involved enzyme. We conclude that egr-1 induction by anisomycin is mediated by p38/SAPK2 and probably by MSK1.

The immediate early gene egr-1 (also known asNGFI-A, zif268, TIS8, andkrox24) encodes a transcription factor containing a DNA binding domain formed by three zinc finger motifs. This protein (Egr-1) binds to a specific GC-rich sequence in the promoter region of many genes to regulate the expression of these target genes, including growth factors and cytokines. egr-1 is rapidly and transiently induced by growth factors and differentiation signals and is functionally involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.egr-1 expression can be induced by tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1 (41Cao X.M.

Whereas in rat mesengial cells, lysophosphatidic acid-mediated egr-1 gene expression does not depend on p38/SAPK2 but on MEK 1 activation (49Reiser C.O. Lanz T. Hofmann F. Hofer G. Rupprecht H.D.

Jain N. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2915-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using the inhibitor SB203580 we have demonstrated that stimulation ofegr-1 induction in response to anisomycin treatment is dependent on activation of p38/SAPK2. We have identified a CRE in theegr-1 promoter necessary for this stimulation and have shown that binding of CREB and ATF1 to this element is stress-induced and phosphorylation-dependent. Furthermore, we analyzed which CREB kinases downstream to p38/SAPK2 could be involved inegr-1 expression and provided evidence that MSK1 but not MK2 may participate in anisomycin-induced up-regulation of theegr-1 gene. Human Jurkat T-cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in 75-cm2 culture flasks. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from MK2 +/+ and −/− mice (68Kotlyarov A. Neininger A. Schubert C. Eckert R. Birchmeier C. Volk H.-D. Gaestel M.

Human 293 cells were grown in 60-mm cell culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. 10 μm SB203580 (Calbiochem) was added to the medium 30 min before anisomycin (Sigma) treatment (10 μg/ml) for 30, 60, 120, or 180 min. Cells (105) were transfected by liposome-mediated transfer using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 3 μg of the differentegr-1 promotor-CAT constructs. To calculate the efficiency of transfection and to normalize CAT activity, 1.5 μg of a cytomegalovirus promoter-luciferase construct was co-transfected. After 5 h of transfection, the medium was replaced and the cells were incubated in fresh medium containing or not 10 μmSB203580 (Calbiochem) for 30 min, and then 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) was added for an additional 30 min. Alternatively, cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3-FLAG-MKK6-EE expressing a constitutively active mutant of MKK6 (19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and, as a control, with 2 μg of pcDNA3. Cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h. For measurement of reporter gene activity, cells were lysed in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mmMgCl2 by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and luciferase activity was determined in 50 μl of lysate with a Lumat luminometer (Bertold). For determination of CAT activity, 50 μl of cell extracts were incubated with 20 μl of 0.01 μCi/μl14C chloramphenicol, 5 μl of 5 mg/ml butyryl coenzyme A (Sigma), 5 μl of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 20 μl of H20 at 37 °C for 1 h. 200 μl of tetramethylpentadecane:xylene (2:1) were then added, and after vortexing, the top organic phase was removed for liquid scintillation counting. Total RNA was prepared from Jurkat T-cells according to Chomczynski et al. (51Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA were separated on agarose-formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon membranes (HybondTM-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP random-primed cDNA probes prepared from a partial egr-1cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession no. AA507023). Hybridized filters were washed under high stringency conditions (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 65 °C) and subjected to bio-imaging using the Cyclone Imaging System and the OptiQuant software package (Packard Instrument Co.). Equal loading of RNA was confirmed by stripping and reprobing the blots with a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.27m sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysatse were clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Determination Kit, and 20 μg of protein was used per kinase assay. Kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μm ATP) containing 1.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 4 μg of purified His-tagged MK2 (p38/SAPK2 assay), 3 μg of GST-c-jun-(1–79) (JNK/SAPK1 assay) (Alexis Corp., San Diego, CA), or 3 μg of Hsp25 (MK2 assay) as substrate. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, and kinase activity was determined by bio-imaging using the Cyclone imaging system and the OptiQuant software package (Packard Instrument Co.). MSK1 was immunoprecipitated from 40 μg of proteins of MEF extract overnight in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm Na3VO4 with 2 μl of MSK1 antibodies (kind gift from Dr. P. Cohen, Dundee, UK). The immunocomplex was bound to 50 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mmMgAc, 25 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of CREBtide (Biotez)). This assay was performed as phospho-cellulose binding assay (25Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis on 7.5–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (HybondTM-carbon extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25 mm Tris, 40 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, and 20% methanol at 1mA/cm2 for 90 min. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:5000 anti-phospho-CREB/ATF1 and anti-CREB rabbit antibodies (New England BioLabs). Immunoreactive proteins were detected according to the enhanced chemiluminescent protocol using 1:5000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Blots were exposed to film for 1–10 min. The egr-1promotor-pCAT construct (56Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was mutated with the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) using the primers 5′-GTCGGATGGGGGGCTTCTCATCACTCCGGGTCCTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAGGACCCGGAGTGATGAGAAGCCCCCCATCCGAC-3′. The correct mutated sequence was controlled by DNA sequencing. A DNA fragment (nt −226 to −109) spanning the distal CRE (nt −136 to −124) of the egr-1 promoter was amplified from the wild type or mutated full-length promoter in pCAT vector by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-AGGCTTCCCCGAAGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGGGAGGACCCGGAGTGACG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was isolated and biotinylated using biotin-High Prime (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions and incubated (2 μg) with 40 μg of proteins of nuclear extracts of 293 cells (53Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) in binding buffer (70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI·dC), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of pretreated (54Kasher M.S. Pintel D. Ward D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3117-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) Streptavidin-agarose was added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. The non-bound proteins were discarded by washing three times with 500 μl of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of elution buffer (1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol), separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies against CREB or phospho-CREB/ATF1 (New England BioLabs). Immunoreactive proteins were detected as described above. To examine the regulation of egr-1induction by the p38/SAPK2 pathway, Jurkat T-cells were treated with anisomycin for different times in the presence or absence of the specific p38α,β/SAPK2a,b inhibitor SB203580. p38/SAPK2 activity was determined in cells lysates by kinase assays using His-tagged MK2 as a substrate. p38/SAPK2 activation was already detectable 30 min after stimulation and a high kinase activity was maintained for more than 3 h (Fig. 1 A). p38/SAPK2 activation by anisomycin was almost completely blocked in the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 1 A, + SB). We also monitored JNK/SAPK1 activity in the cell lysates by using GST-c-jun-(1–79) as a substrate. JNK/SAPK1 shows a kinetics of anisomycin-stimulation similar to p38/SAPK2 (Fig.1 B). However, SB203580 treatment does not inhibit JNK/SAPK1 stimulation in Jurkat T-cells. Total RNA was isolated in parallel and subject to Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 C). egr-1 mRNA was not detectable in cells grown under control conditions. A low level ofegr-1 mRNA becomes detectable after 30 min of anisomycin treatment, increases, and reaches its maximum at about 2 h. SB203580 completely blocked anisomycin-induced egr-1mRNA expression. The similar kinetics of p38/SAPK2 activation andegr-1 expression and, especially, the similar effects of SB203580 indicate that the p38/SAPK2 pathway is directly involved in the regulation of egr-1 expression at the level of mRNA induction. To analyze the mechanism of egr-1 induction by the p38/SAPK2 pathway, human egr-1 promoter-CAT reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected into human 293 cells. The transfected cells were treated with anisomycin in the presence or absence of SB203580, and reporter gene activity was measured (Fig. 2). The full-length promoter (−600) revealed a high reporter gene activity after anisomycin treatment, which was reduced to approximately 50% in the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 2, −600). 5′-Deletion mutants of theegr-1 promoter, lacking potential binding sites for Egr-1, SP1 (−480), and serum response factor (−180), presented a lower reporter gene activity compared with the full-length promoter, but CAT activity showed a similar inhibition by SB203580 treatment (Fig. 2, −480, −235, −180). Further 5′-deletion of the egr-1promoter (−116) resulted in a loss of the reduction of reporter gene activity by SB203580. A putative cAMP-responsive element (CRE) with the sequence 5′-TCACGTCA-3′ was identified within position −134 to −126 in the human egr-1 promoter (55Sakamoto K.M. Bardeleben C. Yates K.E. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of this potential CRE to a CREB/ATF1 nonbinding sequence 5′-TCTCATCA-3′ (−600m) (56Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) within the full-length promoter (−600) results in a complete loss of SB203580 sensitivity of the CAT reporter gene activity (Fig. 2, −600m). To make sure that the transcriptional effects observed are not specific for anisomycin or for the JNK/SAPK1 pathway but for the p38/SAPK pathway, we transfected human 293 cells with a constitutive active mutant of the p38/SAPK2 activator kinase MKK6, MKK6EE (19Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, MKK6EE also activates the egr-1 wild type promoter (−600) but not the mutated one (−600m). Together with the data from the deletion experiments, these findings demonstrate that p38/SAPK2-dependent egr-1 induction is mediated by the CRE within position −134 to −126. These results further indicate that transcription factors binding to this element are targets of the p38/SAPK2 pathway. To determine whether the transcription factors CREB and ATF1 were involved in egr-1 induction, we performed pull-down assays using a biotinylated DNA fragment spanning the distal CRE (nt −134 to −126) of the egr-1 promoter and nuclear extracts of Jurkat T-cells stimulated with anisomycin in the presence or absence of SB203580. Western blot analysis performed with phospho-CREB/ATF1 antibodies revealed that CREB and ATF1 are already phosphorylated to a low extent in nonstimulated Jurkat T-cells (Fig.3 A, nuclear extract,C). After anisomycin treatment CREB and ATF1 are highly phosphorylated (Fig. 3 A, nuclear extract, Ani). This phosphorylation is completely blocked by SB203580 treatment (Fig.3 A, nuclear extract, SB). Pull-down assays revealed that phospho-CREB and phospho-ATF1 bind to the wild type CRE of the egr-1 promoter (−226 to −109) in anisomycin-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and B, wtCRE, Ani). In the presence of SB203580, no binding of CREB, phospho-CREB, or phospho-ATF1 could be detected (Fig. 3, A and B,wtCRE, SB). In cells grown under control conditions, phospho-ATF1 binds also to the wild type CRE (Fig. 3 A,wtCRE, C). Binding of CREB, phospho-CREB, or phospho-ATF1 was not detected using the mutant CRE (−226 to −109, A-132T, G-130A) (Fig. 3, A and B,mCRE). These data indicate a phosphorylation-specific binding of CREB and ATF1 to the CRE. Because it is clear that p38/SAPK2 itself is not able to directly phosphorylate CREB and ATF1, it becomes highly probable that protein serine/threonine kinases downstream to p38/SAPK2"

Repair of DNA double-strand breaks by radiation is dependent on a multifunctional complex containing Rad50, Mre11, and the NBS1 gene product, p95 (NBS protein, nibrin). The role of p95 in these repair processes is unknown. Here it is demonstrated that Mre11 is hyperphosphorylated in a cell cycle-independent manner in response to treatment of cells with genotoxic agents including γ irradiation. This response is abrogated in two independently established NBS cell lines that have undetectable levels of the p95 protein. NBS cells are also deficient for radiation-induced nuclear foci containing Mre11, while those with Rad51 are unaffected. An analysis of the kinetic relationship between Mre11 phosphorylation and the appearance of its radiation-induced foci indicates that the former precedes the latter. Together, these data suggest that specific phosphorylation of Mre11 is induced by DNA damage, and p95 is essential in this process, perhaps by recruiting specific kinases.

Mre11 is a multifunctional protein that, in conjunction with its partners, plays critical roles in homologous recombination used for processing DNA double-strand breaks, nonhomologous DNA end-joining, meiotic recombination, DNA damage response, and telomere maintenance (9Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Mre11 co-localizes to subnuclear volumes containing DNA breaks within 30 min after irradiation of normal human diploid fibroblasts (10Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In NBS cells, a deficiency of p95 is correlated with an inability to form Mre11-Rad50 nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Together, these observations point to a major role for the Mre11-Rad50-p95 complex in repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Mre11 and Rad50 can be detected in a complex in the absence of the p95 protein (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Mre11 alone has endonuclease activity, and its 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is increased when present in a complex with Rad50 (4Paull T.T. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The role of p95 in the Mre11-Rad50 complex is unclear, and it is presently unknown why a deficiency of p95 in NBS patients leads to chromosomal instability and other defects. To begin to address these issues, we have investigated the changes of the Mre11-Rad50-p95 complex in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. T24, a human bladder carcinoma cell line, Saos2, a human osteocarcinoma cell line, and GM09607A, an ataxia telangiectasia gene mutant cell line (Coriell Cell Repositories), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% FBS, 10% CO2. NBS cell line, JS, obtained from K. Sullivan (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), and BRCA1 mutant breast cancer cells, HCC1937 (11Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.-L. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K.

DNA-PK-deficient cells, M059J, and DNA-PK-proficient cells, M059K, both of which were obtained from the same patient (Ref. 13Allalunis-Turner M.J. Barron G.M. Day III, R.S. Dobler K.D. Mirzayans R. Radiat. Res. 1993; 134: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, cells provided by J. Allalunis-Turner, Cross Cancer Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 plus 10% FBS, 10% CO2. A second NBS cell line, WG1799 (WG, obtained from V. M. Der Kaloustian, McGill Hospital for Children, McGill University, Montreal), was cultured in minimal essential medium plus 10% FBS, 10% CO2. T24 cells were synchronized by density arrest in G1 as described previously (14Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar). For γ irradiation, cells were exposed in a Mark I, model 68A Irradiator (JL Shepherd & Assoc.) at a rate of 2.5 gray/min. For UV irradiation, cells were exposed in a Stratalinker at 1.0 mJ/cm2. Treatments by other DNA-damaging agents were performed at the following final concentrations: methylmethane sulfonate (MMS, 0.05%), adriamycin (0.2 μg/ml),cis-dichlorodiammine platinum(II) (cis-DDP, 10 μm). Cells lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles (liquid nitrogen, 37 °C) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. For Western analysis, samples were resolved on 8.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membrane. Antibodies specific for hRad50, hMre11, and human p95 (NBS protein) were described previously. 2Q. Zhong, C.-F. Chen, S. Li, Y. Chen, C.-C. Wang, J. Xiao, P.-L. Chen, Z. D. Sharp, and W.-H. Lee, submitted for publication. α-RB mAb 11D7 was used to verify cell cycle status. For immunoprecipitation-Western analyses, equal amounts of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using α-Rad50 mAb, dissolved in SDS loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immnoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The membranes were then probed with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG and visualized by incubation with colorigenic substrates. In some of the experiments, p84, a nuclear matrix protein, served as the internal control for immunoblots. T24 cells grown on coverslips in tissue culture dishes were irradiated as above and collected at various time points as indicated. The cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. After five PBS washes, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin at room temperature for 30 min, followed by five PBS washes. The cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 30 min. After one PBS wash, the cells were incubated with the indicated primary mAb at 4 °C overnight. After five PBS washes, the cells were incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Fisher) for 30 min. After washing extensively in PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, cells were further stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml in H2O, Fisher) and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA). Images obtained from cells with a standard fluorescence microscope (Axiophot Photomicroscope, Zeiss) were recorded with a Hamamatsu CCD camera and processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop. JS cells were centrifuged (800 rpm) onto coverslips using Cytospin 3 (Shandon) prior to processing for immunostaining as described above. Parallel T24 cultures were washed with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and then cultured with phosphate-free medium for 30 min. The medium was exchanged with that containing 300 μCi [32P]phosphoric acid in each culture dish. After a 1-h incubation, the cells were treated with UV and cultured continuously with [32P]phosphoric acid containing media for another 2 h. After harvesting, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with α-Rad50 antibody. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitates were washed and then treated or mock-treated with calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 8.5% SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Mre11 proteins were visualized by incubation with α-Mre11 antibody as described above. The radioactivity was then imaged using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Since Mre11 is postulated to have specific biochemical activities important for DNA repair, we began with its analysis under conditions of DNA damage. For this purpose, T24 cells, derived from a human bladder carcinoma, were exposed to several genotoxic agents, including UV radiation, MMS, γ radiation, adriamycin, or cis-DDP. In Western analyses of Mre11 in the extracts obtained from cells treated with these agents, the presence of two or more slower migrating bands was noted (Fig. 1 A,lanes 2–6, arrowheads, compared with lane 1), suggestive of post-translational modification. To examine the relationship of these damage-induced, slower migrating species in the context of the Mre11-Rad50 complex, α-Rad50 mAb 13B32immunoprecipitates from cells treated with UV, MMS, and γ radiation were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and probed with α-Rad50 mAb and α-Mre11 antibody.2 Fig. 1 B shows that the same pattern of slower migrating Mre11 bands (arrowheads) is present in the Rad50 immunoprecipitates prepared from treated cells (compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2). In contrast to Mre11, Rad50 does not demonstrate any alterations in its mobility subsequent to treatment of the cells (Fig. 1 B, top panel). A common post-translational modification that can result in altered gel mobility of proteins is phosphorylation. To investigate this possibility, α-Rad50 immunoprecipitates from lysates prepared from mock-exposed or UV-exposed cells that had been metabolically labeled with [32P]phosphoric acid were either untreated or treated with CIP. The autoradiograms of gel-fractionated metabolically labeled immunoprecipitates revealed that Mre11 has a moderate level of phosphorylation under these conditions and that UV treatment results in a slower mobility band that is clearly labeled (Fig. 1 C,arrowheads). Whether the moderate level of phosphorylation of Mre11 is constitutive or due to metabolic labeling of the cells is not known. Consistent with Mre11 hyperphosphorylation, CIP treatment eliminated the 32P-labeled Mre11 bands (Fig. 1 C,arrowheads) and results in a single α-Mre11 immunoreactive band in Western analysis of immunoprecipitates, which has a mobility equal to the α-Mre11 band in untreated samples (Fig. 1 D, compare lanes 2, 3, and 4). Hyperphosphorylation of Mre11 also demonstrated a dose- and exposure-dependent response for MMS and γ radiation treatments, respectively (Fig. 1 E). These data firmly indicate that Mre11 is hyperphosphorylated upon treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that this modification may play a role in the biochemistry of repair complexes. It is also apparent in Fig.1 C that both Rad50 and p95, in addition to Mre11, also undergo DNA-damage-induced phosphorylation under conditions of metabolic labeling (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 2 and3), which appears to retard the mobility of the p95 bands, but not Rad50 (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the phosphorylation of Mre11 is cell cycle-dependent, T24 cells were density-arrested (14Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar), subsequently released, and then either mock-exposed or exposed to 0.05% MMS for 1 h. At various times subsequent to release, cells were harvested and the lysates analyzed by immunoblotting with α-Mre11 and α-Rad50 antibodies. The cell cycle status of the lysates at each of the time points was assessed on the immunoblots by probing with α-RB antibodies (Fig.2 B; Ref. 14Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 A shows an approximately equal level phosphorylation of Mre11 at each of time points, indicating that this DNA damage-responsive hyperphosphorylation of Mre11 is cell cycle-independent. Rad50 does not demonstrate any changes in its gel mobility in the lysates of treated cells at any of the time points subsequent to release from arrest (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that the Mre11-Rad50-p95 complex is the target of DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of each component protein. To investigate potential signaling systems that could be involved in Mre11 hyperphosphorylation, a panel of cell lines carrying specific genetic defects involved in the DNA repair processes were used. These included: ATM GM09607A cells, which are deficient for the product of the ataxia telangiectasia gene, a kinase involved in signaling pathways that regulate the response of cells to normal proliferative stimuli and the response to DNA damage (16Auerbach A.D. Verlander P.C. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1997; 9: 600-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); M059J and M059K cells (17Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), which are deficient and proficient, respectively, for DNA-PK, a serine-threonine protein kinase important for DSB (double strand break) repair (18Anderson C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 433-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); HCC1937 cells that express a C-terminally truncated BRCA1 protein and are hypersensitive to DNA damage (11Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.-L. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5360-5364PubMed Google Scholar) that express a C-terminally truncated BRCA2 protein and are hypersensitive to MMS (19Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5287-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar); and Saos2 cells, which are deficient for both the retinoblastoma protein, important in cell cycle regulation, and p53, a critical protein in DNA damage checkpoint control (20Riley D.J. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Elledge R.M. Lee W.H. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Lysates obtained from post-irradiated cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using α-Mre11 antibody. Retarded bands indicative of Mre11 hyperphosphorylation similar to that observed in lysates from treated T24 cells were observed in the lysates prepare from irradiated GM09607A (ATM), Capan-1 (BRCA2), M059K and M059J (DNA-PK), HCC1937 (BRCA1), and Saos2 (RB/p53) cells (Fig. 3A,lanes 1–18 compared with Fig. 1). In striking contrast to these lines, lysates prepared from two independent NBS cell lines (JS and WG) that are deficient for p95 (Fig. 3 B, comparelanes 1–7 with 8 and 9) did not have any slower migrating bands subsequent to treatment of the cells with γ radiation (Fig. 3 A). Since two separate, independent NBS lines did not demonstrate retarded bands indicative of Mre11 phosphorylation upon DNA damage, there is a strong suggestion that p95, a component of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex, is important for phosphorylation of Mre11 during cellular responses to genotoxic events. Consistent with the Western data, metabolically labeled extracts from JS analyzed by α-Rad50 immunoprecipitation showed that labeled Mre11 and Rad50 bands do not increase upon UV treatment (data not shown). Interestingly, in the ATM-deficient cell line, GM09607A, a small amount of the hyperphosphorylated form of Mre11 can be found, which is increased significantly after DNA damage treatment (Fig. 3 A,lane 1, compare with lanes 2 and 3). These results indicate that the ATM kinase may not be responsible for Mre11 hyperphosphorylation. To further investigate potential outcomes of Mre11 hyperphosphorylation, the integrity of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex was assayed in JS and WG cells. Lysates prepared from untreated and MMS-treated T24, JS, and WG (NBS) cells were immunoprecipitated with α-Rad50 mAb 13B3, and Western blots of the immunoprecipitates were probed with p95, Mre11, and Rad50 antibodies. As observed previously, the Mre11 and p95 immunoreactive bands were readily detected in the Rad50 immunoprecipitates from T24 cells regardless of treatment (Fig.4 A, lanes 1 and2). Despite undetectable levels of p95 in JS and WG cells, Mre11, apparently not hyperphosphorylated, was present in the Rad50 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6). These results suggest that an absence of DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Mre11 has no apparent effect on its association with Rad50. We then examined the kinetics of phosphorylation in T24 cells and tested for any possible phosphorylation of Mre11 in JS cells at longer times after radiation exposure than that used in Fig. 3 A and4 A. The analysis of the JS immunoblots using α-Mre11 antibodies showed no retardation of the Mre11 bands at the longer time periods up to 24 h subsequent to radiation exposure. The analysis of the T24 lysates prepared at the indicated times showed that the intensity of the retarded bands peaked 1–3 h subsequent to treatment (Fig. 4 B). A marker of cellular responses to DNA damage involving the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex is radiation-induced foci that can be immunostained by antibodies for each of the constituent proteins (22),2 a response that is abrogated in NBS cells (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). To investigate the temporal relationship of Mre11 phosphorylation and appearance of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 foci, T24 and JS cells were immunostained with the α-Mre11 antibody at various times subsequent to exposure to γ irradiation. As observed previously (2Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), the NBS cell line had no detectable α-Mre11 immunoreactive nuclear foci in treated cells, while T24 cells treated identically had readily detectable foci using this antibody (Fig. 4 C, compare the last two panels in rows one and three, from top tobottom). Interestingly, α-Rad51 antibodies2were effective in immunostaining radiation-induced foci in both T24 and JS cells (Fig. 4 C, panels one and twoof rows one and three). These data further support the notion that the pathways for subnuclear partitioning of the Rad51 protein and Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex in response to DNA damage are distinct.2 The number of cells containing Mre11 foci at each of time points from 0.5 to 24 h was determined, and the percentages were plotted on the x axis as a function of time in the graph illustrated in Fig. 4 D. A similar plot of the relative intensity of the slower migrating Mre11 bands shows that the hyperphosphorylation of Mre11 precedes Mre11 foci formation subsequent to treatment of cells with genotoxic agents (Fig. 4 D). These data indicate that Mre11 hyperphosphorylation subsequent to DNA damage is dependent upon intact p95 protein. The structure of p95 does not suggest a kinase role for this protein, indicating that it may be responsible for recruiting a putative kinase to phosphorylate Mre11. In fact, from Fig. 1 C, it is apparent that both Rad50 and p95 are also phosphorylated upon DNA damage. These results suggest that the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex may be a substrate for the kinase(s). Identification of this kinase(s) will be important toward understanding the DNA damage-responsive signaling pathways that are crucial for cellular responses to genomic insults. Although the consequence of Mre11 hyperphosphorylation does not appear to involve Rad50-Mre11 association in cells, the absence of radiation-induced Mre11 foci in NBS cells suggests that Mre11 hyperphosphorylation may have a role in subnuclear partitioning of the Rad50-Mre11-p95 complex to nuclear volumes containing DNA double-strand breaks (10Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The strong correlations between 1) p95 and DNA-damage-induced Mre11 phosphorylation, 2) p95 and the radiation-induced Rad50-Mre11-p95 nuclear foci, and 3) p95 deficiency and the chromosomal instability and radiation-sensitive phenotype seen in NBS patients all point to the biological significance of the presence of p95 in the Rad50-Mre11 complex. The DNA damage-induced phosphorylation mediated by p95 is likely to be an important event in the DNA repair process. We thank Drs. V. M. Der Kaloustian, K. Sullivan, and J. Allalunis-Turner for providing cell lines; Paula Garza for antibody preparation; and Dr. Tom Boyer for critical reading the manuscript. We are very grateful to both Drs. Wen-Hwa Lee and Z. D.

In order to find common genetic alterations in this oxystress-induced carcinogenesis model, RCCs were produced in F1 hybrid rats between Wistar and Long-Evans strains and genomes were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with microsatellite polymorphic markers by PCR. Five consecutive markers on chromosome 5 (D5Mgh5, D5Mit9, D5Mgh6, D5Mit11 and D5Mit6) showed LOH in >40% of the RCCs. As possible candidate tumor suppressor genes on chromosome 5, p15INK4B and p16INK4A were investigated for genetic alteration and aberrant methylation by Southern blot, PCR/SSCP/ sequencing and methylation-specific PCR. Genetic alteration (homozygous or hemizygous deletion with or without point mutation) or aberrant methylation were found in 30.7 and 53.8% of the RCC cases, respectively, which was proportionally associated with the histological nuclear grade and metastatic activity. Our data suggest that inactivation of p15 and p16 genes could be one of the major pathways responsible for oxystress-induced carcinogenesis."

To investigate the mechanism by which culturing cells on fibronectin diminished the recruitment of RasGAP to the βPDGFR, we focused on SHP-2 since it dephosphorylates the βPDGFR at the phosphotyrosine required for binding of RasGAP. Culturing cells on fibronectin increased the amount of SHP-2 that associated with the βPDGFR. Furthermore, cells expressing receptor mutants that failed to associate with SHP-2 were insensitive to fibronectin. The ECM enhances PDGF-dependent responses by increasing the association of SHP-2 with the βPDGFR, which in turn decreases the time that RasGAP interacts with the receptor.

Furthermore, PDGF triggers activation of Ras better in cell lines that do not express RasGAP as compared with the corresponding control cell lines (13Van der Geer P. Henkemeyer M. Jacks T. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1840-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A similar role for RasGAP has emerged in signaling initiated by other receptor tyrosine kinases. For instance, the RasGAP locus negatively regulates the Sevenless receptor tyrosine kinase during Drosophila eye development (14Gaul U. Mardon G. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the strength of Torso signaling is modulated by RasGAP and has dramatic consequences on terminal structure development in Drosophila (15Cleghon V. Feldmann P. Ghiglione C. Copeland T.D. Perrimon N. Hughes D.A. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 719-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Feldmann P. Eicher E.N. Leevers S.J. Hafen E. Hughes D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1928-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hence, these studies indicate that RasGAP is a negative regulator of several different receptor tyrosine kinases.Given that RasGAP is a negative regulator of the βPDGFR, it is somewhat puzzling that the wild-type βPDGFR associates with RasGAP and is able to efficiently drive biochemical and biological responses. One explanation is that all activated βPDGFRs do not associate with RasGAP. This idea is supported by the observation that the receptor is not stoichiometrically phosphorylated at tyrosine 771, which is required for binding of RasGAP (17Kashishian A. Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This suggests that in an activated cell, the population of receptors are heterogeneous with respect to which sites are phosphorylated and consequently which signaling molecules are present in a receptor dimer. We hypothesize that changing the composition of signal relay enzymes that are recruited to the βPDGFR will alter the signal relay pathways that the receptor will activate.Since changes in the extracellular environment alter the way in which cells respond to PDGF, this variable may influence which signal relay enzymes associate with the PDGFR. One extracellular component that could potentially play a role in changing the composition of signal relay enzymes that associate with the PDGFR are integrins. Integrins are heterodimeric receptors that mediate attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-cell adhesive interactions (reviewed in Ref. 18Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8965) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that integrins can modulate growth factor receptor function. Adherence to the extracellular matrix is critical for stimulation of cell proliferation by growth factors (19Schwartz M.A. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and growth factor-stimulated Erk activation (20Renshaw M. Ren X.-D. Schwartz M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Furthermore, association of integrins with activated insulin and PDGF receptors correlates with enhanced mitogenicity and chemotaxis (21Schneller M. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 22Woodward A. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J. Sessa W. Languino L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Most of the data describing integrin-dependent modulation of growth factor receptor function have been obtained by investigating integrin-dependent signaling in cells that have been replated on ECM-coated dishes or beads. Although this commonly used system is an excellent approach to study signaling downstream of integrins, we were interested in how long term culturing of cells on ECMs alters growth factor signaling. Consequently, after replating cells on an ECM-coated dish, we waited until the integrin-dependent signaling subsided (12–14 h) and then stimulated the cells with PDGF. We found that recruitment of RasGAP to the wild-type βPDGFR was decreased in cells cultured on fibronectin; the duration of PDGF-dependent Ras and Erk activation was prolonged, and the DNA synthesis response was enhanced. The decreased binding of RasGAP was tightly correlated with an increase in the recruitment of SHP-2 to the wild-type βPDGFR. In addition, mutation of the binding site on the βPDGFR for SHP-2 negated the effect of culturing cells on fibronectin. These findings suggest that long term engagement of integrins alters PDGF-dependent signaling by changing the amount of individual signaling molecules that associate with the wild-type βPDGFR, and the net effect is enhanced DNA synthesis. Finally, it appears that SHP-2 is one of the enzymes that acts as a liaison between the ECM and the βPDGFR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell LinesThe Ph cell line was derived from mouse embryos homozygous for the Ph/Ph deletion that includes the α-PDGFR gene (23Seifert R.A. van Koppen A. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4473-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dan Bowen-Pope (University of Washington). These cells are mouse embryo fibroblasts that express endogenous βPDGFR at approximately 1 × 105 βPDGFRs per cell and no αPDGFRs. Ph cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, and 1 mg/ml G418 was added to cultures of cells expressing the introduced chimeric constructs. The F cells were obtained from embryos nullizygous for both the α and β PDGFRs and were kindly provided by Michelle Tallquist and Phillipe Soriano (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle). They were maintained in DME supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.Construction of the PDGFRsChimeric PDGFRsConstruction of the wild-type chimeric PDGFR was described previously (4DeMali K.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N2F771 chimera was constructed by subcloning a SacII/Sal (3′ end of the βPDGFR up to and including the SacII site at position 1972) fragment of the F771 βPDGFR (17Kashishian A. Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) into theSacII/Sal-cut wild-type chimeric receptor. The chimeras were subcloned into the pLXSN2 retroviral vector (4DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 25Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar); virus was generated using the 293T system (26Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the resulting virus was used to infect Ph cells. Receptor-expressing cells were selected in DME medium containing 5% calf serum and 1 mg/ml G418, and the cells were sorted so that the chimeric receptors were expressed at approximately the same number as the endogenous receptors, 1 × 105 receptors per cell. Periodic assessment of the level of receptor expression by Western blot analysis indicated that the levels of expression were stable for at least 12 months.βPDGFR ConstructsThe F1009 PDGFR cDNA (27Kazlauskas A. Feng G.-S. Pawson T. Valius M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6939-6942Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pLXSHD (25Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar), as a 4.2-kilobase pairEcoRI-SalI fragment. The resulting construct was introduced into 293GPG cells (28Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE. Virus was collected for 5 days, concentrated by centrifugation, and resuspended in TNE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.8; 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The resulting virus was used to infect the F cells, and mass populations of receptor-expressing cells were obtained by selecting the cells in DME supplemented with 5% FBS and 10 mm histidinol. The human wild-type βPDGFR was introduced into the amphotropic virus producing cell line PA317 as described previously (29Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Virus from the PA317 cells was used to infect the F cells, and drug-resistant cells were grown out in medium containing 200 μg/ml hygromycin. βPDGFR Western blot analysis of total cell lysates indicated that the WT-expressing cells had approximately 1.0 × 105 receptors/cell.AntibodiesPR292 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in the extracellular domain of the αPDGFR and was purchased from Genzyme. 80.8 is a crude rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein including a portion of the first immunoglobulin domain (residues 52–94) and was used at a 1:1000 dilution. The βPDGFR was immunoprecipitated using crude polyclonal rabbit sera (30A) raised against glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins that included the entire carboxyl terminus of the human βPDGFR subunit (3Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The βPDGFR (3Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were blotted as described previously. For Ras Western blot analysis, a monoclonal pan-Ras antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a 1:500 dilution. To blot for SHP-2, a monoclonal PTP1D antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used at a 1:1000 dilution. For anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis, a combination of PY20 (Transduction Laboratories) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used, each at a 1:1000 dilution. The phospho-Erk antibody (New England Biolabs) is an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic phosphotyrosine peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 196–209 of human p44 Erk. It recognizes both tyrosine-phosphorylated and threonine/tyrosine doubly phosphorylated p42 and p44 Erk and was used at a 1:500 dilution. The pan-Erk antibody used for immunoprecipitation of Erk was a generous gift of Gen-Sheng Feng (Indiana University) and has previously been described (30Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The pan-Erk antibody used for Western blot analysis was a monoclonal antibody available from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and was used at a 1:2500 dilution.Ras AssayThe Ras assay is a modified version of the protocol previously described (31Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar).GST-Raf 50–150 IsolationA construct containing a GST fusion with amino acids 50–150 of Raf was transformed into DH5α bacterial cells. A 20-ml starter culture of LB + 100 μg/ml carbenicillin was inoculated and grown overnight at 37 °C. The starter culture was diluted 1:10 with LB + carbenicillin and incubated at 37 °C until the A 600 was 0.6–0.8, at which time expression of the fusion protein was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 2 h and centrifuged; the pellets were washed once with ice-cold H/S (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and then the pellet was resuspended in HSE (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA) + 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, sonicated, centrifuged to remove the insoluble debris, and Nonidet P-40 added to a final concentration of 0.5%. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 500 μl of washed glutathione beads and washed eight times with HSE + 0.5% Nonidet P-40 + 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin. The purified fusion proteins were left attached to the GST beads and used immediately to purify activated Ras.Purification of Active RasPh cells expressing the various receptor constructs were trypsinized and plated on polylysine (5 mg/ml) or fibronectin-coated plates (Falcon) in DME + 2% calf serum. After the cells had attached and begun spreading (20–30 min at 37 °C), the cells were washed twice with PBS and placed in serum-free DME for 12 h. The cells were then exposed for 5–30 min to 50 ng/ml PDGF AA or buffer (2 mm acetic acid and 10 mg/ml BSA), washed 2× in H/S (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), lysed, and then incubated with approximately 20–30 μg of GST-Raf fusion protein for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in 600 μl of lysis buffer; sample buffer (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was added, and the proteins were resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to Immobilon in a methanol-containing transfer buffer (150 mm glycine, 25 mm NaCl, 10% CH3OH) and subjected to a Ras Western blot except that Blotto without azide was used in place of Blotto.Erk ActivationParental Ph cells or Ph cells expressing a chimeric PDGFR were grown to 85–90% confluence, serum-starved in DME + 0.1% calf serum for 18–24 h, left resting (−) or stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF AA (Ph cells expressing a chimeric PDGFR) or 40 ng/ml PDGF BB (parental Ph cells) for 5–30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with H/S (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), lysed in EB (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) without BSA, and centrifuged to remove the insoluble debris. The amount of protein in the lysates was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and equal amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon and probed with a phospho-Erk antibody. Activation of Erk was also monitored by assaying Erk activity in an in vitro kinase assay. Ph cells expressing the wild-type or N2F771 chimeric PDGFR were grown to 85–90% confluence, incubated in DME + 0.1% calf serum overnight, and then stimulated with buffer or 50 ng/ml PDGF AA for 5–120 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with H/S + 2 mm sodium orthovanadate (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and lysed in EB (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and Erk was immunoprecipitated using a pan-Erk antibody (3Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Erk immunoprecipitates representing approximately 1.5 × 105 cells were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of 0.75 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). The proteins were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was stained to show the relative amounts of myelin basic protein present and then exposed to film. The phosphorylated bands were excised and counted in a scintillation counter.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisFor studies involving cells plated on plastic, Ph cells expressing the chimeric PDGFR were grown to 85–90% confluence, incubated in DME + 0.1% calf serum for 18–24, and stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AA for the times indicated. For studies involving cells plated on polylysine or an ECM, Ph cells were grown to 90% confluence, trypsinized briefly, and plated on 5 mg/ml polylysine (Sigma)- or fibronectin (Falcon)-coated dishes. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and incubated in DME alone for 12 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Under both plating conditions, the cells were then stimulated with buffer (10 mm acetic acid + 2 mg/ml BSA) or 40 ng/ml PDGF BB for the times indicated, washed, and lysed in EB (32Kazlauskas A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Seifert R. Hart C.E. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3727-3735Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the βPDGFRs were immunoprecipitated using 30A (3Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were bound to formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus membranes and washed as described previously (33Kazlauskas A. Kashishian A. Cooper J.A. Valius M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2534-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting gel was transferred to Immobilon and subjected to Western blot analysis. Proteins were detected using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).In Vitro Kinase AssayThe intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGFR was analyzed using receptor immunoprecipitates from approximately 2 × 105 cells as described previously (4DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).[3H]Thymidine UptakePDGF-stimulated [3H]thymidine uptake was assayed as follows. Cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/ml in DME + 2% FBS in 24-well dishes and incubated at 37 °C for 1.0 h at which time they were washed 2× in PBS and placed in DME containing 0.1% FBS. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 h at which time they were washed 2× in PBS and incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C in DME containing 2 mg/ml BSA. Buffer (10 mm acetic acid and 2 mg/ml BSA), PDGF BB (5 or 40 ng/ml), or 10% FBS was added; the cultures were incubated for 22 h and the media replaced by DME + 5% FBS and 0.8 μCi of [3H]thymidine per ml, and the incubation was prolonged for 4 h. The cells were then harvested as described previously (24DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSWe have previously found that artificially altering the composition of signaling molecules that are recruited to the βPDGFR profoundly changes the nature of the signaling cascades initiated by PDGF (3Valius M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 5905-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since extracellular changes such as cell density or ECM alter the ability of PDGF to initiate biological responses (21Schneller M. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 22Woodward A. Garcia-Cardena G. Leong M. Madri J. Sessa W. Languino L. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 469-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,34Kazlauskas A. DiCorleto P.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 126: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we postulated that the basis of the altered responsiveness to PDGF is due to a change in signaling enzymes that associate with the receptor. In this study, we examined whether changing the composition of the signal enzymes which associated with the wild type βPDGFR was the mechanism by which integrins can modulate growth factor receptor function. Consequently, we focused on cell lines naturally expressing the wild-type βPDGFR, and we compared RasGAP co-immunoprecipitation with the βPDGFR when the cells were cultured on polylysine or fibronectin. Ph cells were grown to 90% confluence, trypsinized, resuspended in DME + 2% calf serum, and then plated in dishes coated with polylysine or fibronectin. Once the cells had adhered (after 30 min), the cultures were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in serum-free DME at 37 °C for 12–14 h. Pilot experiments indicated that Erk activity was elevated soon after plating and gradually returned to basal levels by 12–14 h (data not shown). The cells were either left resting or stimulated with 40 ng/ml PDGF BB for 5–30 min and lysed; the βPDGFR was immunoprecipitated, and the amount of co-immunoprecipitating RasGAP was assessed by Western blotting (Fig.1 A). In cells cultured on polylysine, the level of receptor-associated RasGAP was similar from 5 to 20 min, and less RasGAP was present in the 30-min sample. The decrease in the amount of co-precipitating RasGAP was seen earlier in cells cultured on fibronectin (at the 20-min time point), and by 30 min only a trace amount of RasGAP was present. Thus RasGAP associates with the receptor under both sets of conditions, but in the cells cultured on fibronectin, RasGAP binding is more transient than in the control cells.Since binding of RasGAP depends on tyrosine phosphorylation of the βPDGFR, it is possible that the differences in RasGAP binding reflect an ECM-dependent alteration in the extent and/or the duration of receptor phosphorylation and/or kinase activity. To investigate this possibility, receptors were immunoprecipitated from cells that were treated as described in Fig. 1 A, and the extent of receptor phosphorylation was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). We found that tyrosine phosphorylation of the βPDGFR was similar in cells cultured on polylysine or fibronectin (Fig. 1 B). The intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor was assessed by subjecting the receptor immunoprecipitates to an in vitro kinase assay in the presence of an exogenous substrate, GST-PLCγ. Altering the ECM did not detectably change the basal or PDGF-stimulated kinase activity of the receptor (Fig.1 C). Thus, while the overall extent of the βPDGFR phosphorylation or kinase activity was not altered by the ECM of cells, the duration that RasGAP stably associated with the βPDGFR decreased when cells are cultured on fibronectin.Effect of ECM on Pathways Downstream of RasGAPWe next examined whether pathways downstream of RasGAP were affected by culturing cells on an ECM, and we focused on PDGF-dependent Ras and Erk activation. Ph cells were plated, starved, and stimulated as described above and lysed, and active GTP-bound Ras was recovered from the lysate with a GST fusion protein that includes the Ras binding domain of Raf. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with a pan-Ras antibody; the signal was quantitated, and the fold activation was plotted as a function of time. Fig.2 A shows that PDGF-induced Ras activation comparably at the earliest time points under either culture conditions but that the levels of active Ras persisted longer in the cells cultured on fibronectin. Furthermore, the difference in Ras activation between the two culture conditions was most apparent at the times when RasGAP binding diminished. It is not obvious why receptors that bind RasGAP are able to activate Ras at the earliest time points (under either of the culture conditions), but this may be related to the timing of events that increase the level of active Ras. We also observed prolonged PDGF-dependent activation of Ras in cells cultured on fibronectin expressing a chimeric α/β PDGFR (data not shown).Figure 2Ras and Erk activation of cells plated on polylysine or fibronectin. A, Ph cells were cultured and stimulated as described in Fig. 1. Active Ras was recovered from the total cell lysates representing 1.0 × 107 cells by incubation with a GST fusion of Raf which contains the Ras binding domain. The recovered proteins were washed, resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to Immobilon, and probed with a pan-Ras antibody. The bands were quan"

Increased plasma levels of PAI-1 have been shown to be associated with venous thrombosis and to predispose to arterial thrombosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Lijnen H. Collen D. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2052-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice deficient for PAI-1 show increased endotoxin-induced venous thrombosis and enhanced neointima formation upon vessel wall injury, whereas mice overexpressing PAI-1 suffer from spontaneous venous occlusions (3Carmeliet P.F.M.

Components of the fibrinolytic system are also involved in extracellular matrix degradation required for invasion and metastasis of neoplastic cells. PAI-1 is thought to play two independent roles in such processes by protecting the tumor stroma from urokinase-type plasminogen activator-mediated degradation and by favoring detachment of vitronectin-bound cells (5Deng G.

Brunner N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 259-267PubMed Google Scholar). The poor prognosis of high PAI-1 levels in many cancer patients might also stem from its recently demonstrated role in tumor vascularization (7Bajou K. Noel A. Gerard R.D. Masson V. Brunner N.

PAI-1 gene expression was shown to be stimulated by a variety of cytokines, growth factors, hormones, phorbol esters, and endotoxins (8Loskutoff D.J. Sawdey M. Keeton M. Schneiderman J. Thromb.

Some cis-elements involved in gene regulations have been identified in the human PAI-1 promoter, such as those involved in the induction by transforming growth factor-β (9Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.

We have previously cloned and characterized a novel transcription factor involved in basal expression of the human PAI-1 gene in HeLa cells (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The protein, named helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) has a specific DNA-binding domain, a RING finger domain, and the seven conserved DNA helicase domains; it is homologous to proteins of the SNF/SWI family that play a role in chromatin remodeling and facilitate trans-factor interaction with nucleosomes (reviewed in Refs. 18Carlson M.

Two HLTF proteins differing in translation initiation site were observed, only the smaller of which, HLTFMet123, is transcriptionally active. The same protein was independently isolated by other groups because it interacted with other DNA targets (the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat and the simian virus enhancer, the myosin light chain locus enhancer, the rabbit uteroglobin promoter, a tumor necrosis factor response element), and shown to display DNA-dependent ATPase activity (22Hayward-Lester A.

HLTF activates the PAI-1 promoter via specific interaction with the B box that was initially identified as a phorbol ester-responsive element (13Descheemaeker K.A. Wyns S. Nelles L. Auwerx J. Ny T. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15086-15091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but was later shown only to be involved in basal expression (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The B box is highly similar to the GT box (also called CACCC motif), which has been shown to bind Sp1 as well as other recently identified members of the expanding Sp family of transcription factors (26Kadonaga J.

Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed and is essential for early embryonic development (29Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar); it can activate transcription of a large number of regulated and constitutively expressed genes, whether the promoter comprises a TATAA box or not (30Courey A. Tjian R. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 contain a similar DNA-binding domain, with three zinc fingers and two glutamine- and serine/threonine-rich trans-activation domains (28Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Sp3 contains an additional inhibitory domain, leading to either activation or repression depending on the promoter and cellular context (31Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G.

In the present work, we investigated the interplay between Sp1/Sp3 and HLTF in basal expression from the proximal PAI-1 promoter. The pGL-3 Basic vectors, luciferin, and reporter-lysis buffer were from Promega (Leiden, The Netherlands); the Galacto-Light kit was from Tropix (Bedford, MA). The Protein A-Sepharose poly(dI-dC/dI-dC), radioactive precursors, and the ECL Western blot detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Merelbeke, Belgium). Culture media, fetal calf serum, media additions, and LipofectAMINE transfection reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Ghent, Belgium). The Qiagen plasmid extraction kits were from Westburg (Leusden, The Netherlands). Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). Monoclonal antibodies against Sp1 and Sp3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the polyclonal antisera against Sp1 or Sp3 have been described elsewhere (31Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), as has the antiserum against murine plasminogen (38Lijnen H. Van Hoef B. Collen D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fusion protein between glutathioneS-transferase and the HLTF DNA-binding domain (GST-HLTF-DBD), previously named GST-6D3, and mAb2F6, a monoclonal antibody directed against 6D3, have been described (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The HeLa andDrosophila SL2 cells were provided by Dr. C. Backendorf (University of Leiden, Leiden, The Netherlands) and Dr. W. Wahli (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland), respectively. The pPacUbxSp1 and pPacUbxSp3 expression vectors and GST-Sp3 mutants have been described elsewhere (34Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), the GST-Sp1 mutants were kindly provided by Dr. E. Wintersberger (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria), and the pPacSp1N619(ΔD) and the Δ44-LacZ vectors were provided by Dr. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA) and Dr. Spear (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY), respectively. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared as described (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides (sequence of top strands given in Fig.2 A) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. EMSA was performed with 6 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extract that were incubated with 20,000 cpm of32P-labeled probe in a 20-μl volume containing 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm (or other concentrations as indicated) NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC/dI-dC). After 15 min at room temperature, electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, which was prerun for 30 min. When needed, 1 μl of antibody (corresponding to 100 ng of proteins) was added to the binding assay mixtures and incubated for 30 min on ice before addition of labeled probes. The 336-bp fragment (coordinates −318 to +18 bp) of the human PAI-1 promoter was obtained by PCR amplification with appropriate primers and cloning into theBglII and HindIII sites of thepGL-3-Basic plasmid yielding PAI-1-luc. For transfection experiment in Drosophila SL2 cells, the test DNA fragments were subcloned into the BamHI andHindIII sites of the Δ44-LacZ vector (39Spear B.T. Longley T. Moulder S.L. Wang S.L. Peterson M.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) replacing the original alkaline phosphatase promoter to yieldPAI-1-lacZ. This vector was chosen since, in contrast toPGL3-Basic or pBLCAT3, it presented no induction upon Sp1 or Sp3 transient co-expression (data not shown). Mutagenesis of the PAI-1 promoter B box was done by four-way PCR as described elsewhere (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The minimal (−34 to +33 bp) adenovirus major late promoter was cloned as a BglII/HindIII fragment upstream from theluc gene into the pGL3 vector. Two copies of the B box and its mutants (Fig. 2 A) synthesized withKpnI and BamHI linkers were then inserted into the KpnI and BglII sites to provide the(Bbox) 2 -AdMLp-luc series. To build Drosophila expression vectors for HLTF, HLTFMet1 and HLTFMet123 cDNAs (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR with primers introducing BglII and SalI sites on the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, and were inserted into the BamHI andXhoI sites of the pPacUbx vector (40Courey A. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). The expression vector for the GST-Sp3 deletion mutant containing amino acids 495–653, i.e. the zinc finger and D domains (GST-Sp3ZD), was made by inserting into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-1λT a Sp3 cDNA fragment amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-GGGAAAAAGCAACACATTTG-3′ and 5′-TTACTCCATTGTCTCATT-3′ carrying a 5′ BamHI orEcoRI site, respectively. In order to compare easily the GST-Sp1 and -Sp3 deletion mutants from different sources, we used a nomenclature based on the domains retained, i.e. GST-Sp1, GST-Sp1ABC, GST-Sp1A, and GST-Sp1ZD for the mutants described by Ref.41Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, originally numbered aa 1–788, aa 1–621, aa 1–293, and aa 622–788, respectively. The HLTF cDNA cloned into pGEM4Z (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was digested with restriction enzymes followed by internal ligation to generate the indicated mutants schematically represented in Fig. 6 A (the wild type cDNA sequence has accession number Z46606 in EMBL/GenBank); digestion with SnaBI and Ecl136II (Δaa 528–751; ΔH II-III), Ecl136II, andPmaCI (Δaa 751–817; ΔRING), SpeI andBalI (Δaa 49–107; ΔNDBD), BalI andBclI (Δaa 107–477; ΔCDBD/H I). The COOH truncation mutant (Δaa 924–1009; ΔH VI) was obtained by linearization withXhoI. Mutant ΔNTS (Δaa 597–735) was obtained by four-way PCR. All the constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequence determination, amplified, and purified with Qiagen plasmid extraction kits. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. For transfection, a total of 2.5 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded per well of Falcon six-well plates, and grown overnight before addition of 2 μg of reporter plasmid, 10 ng of CMVβ internal control, and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in 1 ml of Opti-MEM. After 5 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with growth medium. Cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays 16 h after transfection (see below). Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities. SL2 cells were grown in M3 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 1 mm glutamine at 28 °C. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated into 3.5-cm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106/dish. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (42Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Each dish received 4 μg of reporter plasmid and different amounts of pPacUbx expression vectors (see figure legends) brought to a total of 1 μg with control vector. After DNA addition, the plates were left undisturbed until the time of harvest, 24 h later. Cell extracts from transfected cells were prepared in reporter/lysis buffer. The protein concentration was determined with the Bradford assay, and equal amounts of cell extracts were used for luciferase assay with luciferin or for β-galactosidase activity with Galacton chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were done in triplicate and repeated three to five times with different preparations of the same plasmid. 35S-Labeled HLTF proteins were obtained by in vitro transcription/translation in the TNT reticulocyte lysate of pGEM4Z constructs into which the cDNA was under control of the T7 promoter. The GST-Sp1, GST-Sp3, and mutant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli from pGEX vectors and purified by adsorption onto glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer. The GST pull-down experiments were performed as described (41Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of a 50:50 slurry of the glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST fusion protein (1 μg) were incubated with either 10 μl of reticulocyte lysate translation mix containing 35S-labeled HLTF protein (wild type or mutant) or 200 μg of HeLa nuclear extract in 200 μl of binding buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. The binding buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer and then boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer, followed by analysis on 8% SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining demonstrated the presence of similar amounts of GST fusion proteins. The HLTF proteins were visualized either by autoradiography (35S label) or Western blotting using 10 μg/ml mAb2F6 and the ECL detection system. For co-immunoprecipitation, 200 μg of HeLa nuclear extract were incubated with 10 μg of polyclonal antibody directed against either 6D3 or murine plasminogen (negative control) in 500 μl of NET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin) as described (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 1 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed two times with 1 ml of NET buffer and then once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE and revealed by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against either HLTF, Sp1, or Sp3 and the ECL detection system. The DNA dideoxynucleotide sequencing reaction was performed with the AutoRead sequencing kit in presence of either fluorescence-labeled or unlabeled primers combined with fluorescence-labeled dATP. Samples were processed on the Automated Laser Fluorescent DNA Sequencer system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Generated sequences were analyzed with software (44Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group provided by the Belgian EMBL Node (Brussels, Belgium). Student's t test for paired values was used to evaluate luciferase and β-galactosidase transient expression. In a previous study, EMSAs performed with a 32P-labeled B box oligonucleotide (coordinates −86 to −60 bp in the human PAI-1 promoter; Ref. 13Descheemaeker K.A. Wyns S. Nelles L. Auwerx J. Ny T. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15086-15091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and HeLa nuclear extracts had shown a major shifted band corresponding to several protein/DNA complexes (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to identify the proteins involved in these complexes, EMSA conditions have now been modified allowing resolution of four distinct complexes (C1, C2, and the C3a/C3b doublet in Fig. 1). Protein/DNA interactions were strongly affected by the salt concentration of the binding buffer. At 150 mm NaCl, a strong C3a/C3b doublet and a weak C1 complex were observed (lane 1) while decreasing the salt concentration led to progressive decline of the doublet intensity and simultaneous appearance of a strong C1 and a weak C2 complex (lanes 2–5). Addition of antibodies directed against Sp3 to the EMSA reaction caused a supershift of complex C2 (Fig. 1 B,lane 3). A partial supershift of complex C1 was caused by Sp1 antibodies (lane 4), and further addition of Sp3 antibodies suppressed most of the remaining complex (lane 2). Formation of the C3a complex was inhibited by addition of mAb2F6 directed against HLTF (lane 6) but not by an unspecific antibody (lane 5). None of the antibodies used suppressed complex C3b. In aggregate, these data indicate that HLTF (complex C3a), Sp1 (complex C1), and Sp3 (complexes C1 and C2) can bind to the B box. A degenerate consensus binding site, 5′-(A/G)G(C/T)(G/A/T)G(A/T)(A/T)(T/C/A)-3′ was identified in a target definition assay performed according to Ref. 45Alex R. Sozeri O. Meyer S. Dildrop R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholarwith the HLTF DNA-binding domain produced in bacteria as a GST fusion protein (GST-HLTF-DBD; Ref. 17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and data not shown). The B box of the PAI-1 promoter contains a tandem repeat of sequences (5′-AGTGG GTG-3′ and 5′-GGCTG GAA-3′) that present one or two mismatches (bold) with this target. These repeats flank the GT box (5′-GGGTG-3′) that partially overlaps with the upstream putative HLTF site (Fig. 2 A,upper line). A panel of B box oligonucleotide mutants affecting G nucleotides either in the putative HLTF binding sites or in the GT box (Fig.2 A) were synthesized. They were evaluated in a competition assay for their ability to suppress, at a 50-fold molar excess, complexes formed by the radiolabeled wild type B box in EMSA performed as above (Fig. 1 B). Mutant 1 bearing mutations at bp −72, −73, −75, and −76 had previously been shown to have strongly reduced affinity for HLTF (17Ding H. Descheemaeker K. Marynen P. Nelles L. Carvalho T. Carmo-Fonseca M. Collen D. Belayew A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); consistently, it could suppress neither HLTF- nor Sp1/Sp3-containing complexes (Fig. 2 B). Mutant 3 with a single mutation at bp −76 could not interact with Sp1/Sp3 either but was able to bind HLTF since it suppressed its complex (C3a). Mutants 4, 5 (data not shown), 6, 9, and 10 could still bind Sp1/Sp3 since they prevented formation of their complexes (C1 and C2) with the wild type B box but had reduced affinity for HLTF, only weakly affecting its complex. Mutant 8 affecting bp −70 and −71 bound Sp1/Sp3 less effectively since it only suppressed partially the complexes these proteins form with the wild type B box. In aggregate, these data indicate that the sequences AGTGG and GGCTG are binding motifs for HLTF and that both have to be mutated simultaneously (Mut10) to suppress HLTF interaction; these mutations do not affect Sp1/Sp3 binding to the overlapping GT box, while a point mutation could be found that affects only Sp1/Sp3 binding (Mut3). Two copies of either the B box oligonucleotide or its mutants were fused to a luciferase reporter gene with a minimal adenovirus major late promoter (TATA-luc) and the resulting(Bbox) 2 -TATA-luc reporter vectors were introduced into HeLa cells. Transient luciferase expression was not affected by mutations in either of the two HLTF binding sites (Fig.3 A, Mut6 andMut9); however, the combined mutations (Mut10) led to a 2-fold reduced luc activity as compared with the wild type B box. Mutations in the Sp1/Sp3 binding site (Mut1or Mut3) reduced transient luciferase activity to the level of the control TATA-luc construct. The mutations suppressing only either Sp1/Sp3 (Mut3) or HLTF (Mut10) binding were introduced into the 318-bp PAI-1 promoter fused to the luc gene and the constructs evaluated by transient expression in HeLa cells. The single G −76 mutation in the Sp1/Sp3 site (Fig. 3 B, PAI-1 Mut3-Luc) led to a 6-fold reduced luciferase activity as compared with the wild type promoter (PAI-1-Luc) while the combined mutations affecting both HLTF sites (PAI-1 Mut10-Luc) resulted in a 2.5-fold inhibition. These data demonstrate a positive correlation between binding of HLTF and Sp1/Sp3 to these sites and transcriptional activity. In order to further study the interplay between Sp1/Sp3 and HLTF on the B box,Drosophila SL2 cells, which lack endogenous Sp1-like activity, were used for transient expression experiments. The 318-bp PAI-1 promoter fused to the lacZ reporter gene was activated in a dose-dependent manner by co-expression with either Sp1 or Sp3, reaching maximal 26.0 ± 0.3- and 14.3 ± 0.2-fold stimulation in the presence of 500 ng of pPacUbxSp1 orpPacUbxSp3 expression vector, respectively. This effect was mediated by the GT box, since only minor stimulations (1.3 ± 0.1-fold and 1.4 ± 0.1-fold with 100 ng of Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector, respectively) were observed with the PAI-1-Mut3-LacZinto which the Sp1/Sp3 binding site was mutated, as compared with the activations reached with the same amount (1 μg) of wild typePAI-1-LacZ (6.2 ± 0.2-fold and 5.9 ± 0.2-fold with 100 ng of Sp1 or Sp3 expression vector, respectively). In conclusion, Sp1 and Sp3 can stimulate the PAI-1 promoter provided their binding site is intact in the B box. The use of altern"
https://openalex.org/W2086778142,"The present work uses α-conotoxin ImI (CTx ImI) to probe the neurotransmitter binding site of neuronal α7 acetylcholine receptors. We identify key residues in α7 that contribute to CTx ImI affinity, and use mutant cycles analysis to identify pairs of residues that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex. We first mutated key residues in the seven known loops of α7 that converge at the subunit interface to form the ligand binding site. The mutant subunits were expressed in 293 HEK cells, and CTx ImI binding was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding. The results reveal a predominant contribution by Tyr-195 in α7, accompanied by smaller contributions by Thr-77, Tyr-93, Asn-111, Gln-117, and Trp-149. Based upon our previous identification of bioactive residues in CTx ImI, we measured binding of receptor and toxin mutations and analyzed the results using thermodynamic mutant cycles. The results reveal a single dominant interaction between Arg-7 of CTx ImI and Tyr-195 of α7 that anchors the toxin to the binding site. We also find multiple weak interactions between Asp-5 of CTx ImI and Trp-149, Tyr-151, and Gly-153 of α7, and between Trp-10 of CTx ImI and Thr-77 and Asn-111 of α7. The overall results establish the orientation of CTx ImI as it bridges the subunit interface and demonstrate close approach of residues on opposing faces of the α7 binding site.

By mutating both the toxin and the membrane protein, thermodynamic mutant cycles analysis can pinpoint pairs of residues that stabilize the complex, thus generating a negative image of the active site according to the structure of the toxin (1Ackerman E.J.

Here we probe the acetylcholine binding site of neuronal α7 acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)1 using α-conotoxin ImI (CTx ImI). We mutate both the receptor and the toxin and use mutant cycles analysis to identify pairs of residues that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex. α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-bridged peptides that competitively antagonize muscle and neuronal nicotinic AChRs. Owing to their ability to distinguish between the α-γ and α-δ binding sites of muscle AChRs, as well as differentiate muscle from neuronal AChRs, α-conotoxins have become valuable probes of agonist binding sites of the nicotinic AChR superfamily (4Sine S.M.

As an example of α-conotoxin selectivity for AChR subtypes, the α-conotoxins MI and GI bind with high affinity to muscle but not neuronal AChRs, whereas α-conotoxins ImI and MII bind with high affinity to certain neuronal but not muscle AChRs (9McIntosh J.M.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 194-199PubMed Google Scholar). All α-conotoxins contain N- and C-terminal loops, two disulfide bridges, and proline in the N-terminal loop, but the various α-conotoxins differ by the composition and number of residues in each loop (Fig. 1). Thus, structural differences among α-conotoxins and AChR binding sites determine the specificity of receptor-conotoxin interactions. Mutagenesis and site-directed labeling studies establish that the ligand binding sites of the AChR are formed at interfaces between subunits. Whereas the two binding sites of muscle AChR are formed at interfaces between α1 and either δ or γ subunits, binding sites of the α7 neuronal AChR are formed at interfaces between identical α7 subunits. Residues of the α face of the binding site, termed the (+) face, cluster in three well separated regions of the primary sequence, termed loops A, B, and C (Fig. 2). Using the numbering system for human α7receptors, key residues in these loops include Tyr-93 in loop A, Trp-149 in loop B, and Tyr-188 and Tyr-195 in loop C (12Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M.

The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor: Current Views and Future Trends. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar). Similarly, residues of the non-α face of the binding site, termed the (−) face, cluster in four separate regions of the primary sequence, termed loops I through IV (Fig. 2). Key residues in these loops include Ser-34 in loop I, Trp-55 in loop II, Gln-117 in loop III, and Asp-164 in loop IV (12Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys.

Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 31-59Google Scholar). The observation that these seven loops converge to form a localized binding site has led to a multiloop model of the major extracellular domain of the AChR (12Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous work used the competitive antagonist dimethyl-d-tubocurarine (DMT) to probe the ligand binding site of the muscle AChR (14Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies showed that residues on opposing faces of the subunits, Tyr-198 in the α subunit and Tyr-117 in the γ subunit, approach to within 11 Å to provide aromatic donors that stabilize the two positively charged nitrogens of DMT. α-Conotoxins permit analogous studies of binding site structure, but unlike DMT or small organic ligands, they can be readily modified using peptide synthesis. Owing to their larger size, asymmetric structure, and probable multiple points of contact, α-conotoxins should lead to further definition of the architecture of the AChR binding site. We previously identified residue differences between α7and muscle AChRs that confer neuronal specificity for CTx ImI (15Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, we identified residues in CTx ImI that determine its affinity for α7 receptors (16Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The present work identifies pairs of residues that stabilize the complex formed between α7receptors and CTx ImI. We find that the receptor-conotoxin complex is stabilized by a dominant aromatic-quaternary interaction, supplemented by multiple weaker interactions. The results establish the orientation of CTx ImI as it bridges the subunit interface. 125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products,d-tubocurarine chloride from ICN Pharmaceuticals, 293 human embryonic kidney cell line (293 HEK) from the American Type Culture Collection, and unlabeled α-Bgt from Sigma Chemicals. Human α7 and rat 5HT-3 subunit cDNAs were generously provided by Drs. John Lindstrom and William Green. Wild-type and mutants of α-conotoxin ImI were synthesized by the Mayo Protein Core Facility using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 431A peptide synthesizer. During synthesis, cysteine (S-triphenylmethyl)-protecting groups were incorporated at cysteines 3 and 12, and acetamidomethyl-protecting groups were incorporated at cysteines 2 and 8. The linear peptide was purified by reversed phase HPLC using a Vydac C18 preparative column with trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile buffers. The two intramolecular disulfide bridges were formed as follows; theS-triphenylmethyl protecting groups attached to cysteines 3 and 12 were removed during trifluoroacetic acid cleavage of the linear peptide from the support resin. The peptide was then oxidized by molecular oxygen to form the 3–12 disulfide bond by stirring in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C for 24 h. The peptide was lyophilized prior to formation of the second disulfide bond. The acetamidomethyl-protecting groups on cysteine 2 and 8 were removed oxidatively by iodine as described (17Andrue D. Albericio F. Solé N.A. Munson M.C. Ferrer M. Barany G. Pennington M.W. Dunn B.M. Methods in Molecular Biology: Peptide Synthesis Protocols. 35. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 139-140Google Scholar), except the peptide/iodine reaction was allowed to progress for 16 h prior to carbon tetrachloride extraction. The pure product was separated from residual iodine by HPLC, and verified by mass spectrometry. Formation of disulfide bonds was confirmed as described previously (16Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).

AChR subunit cDNAs were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 (18Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Mutant cDNAs were constructed by bridging naturally occurring or mutagenically installed restriction sites with double-stranded oligonucleotides or by the Quick ChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. To increase expression, the extracellular domains of α7 and all mutations were joined to the rat 5HT-3 sequence at the start of the M1 transmembrane domain (15Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The α7 point mutants are named as follows; the first letter and number refer to the wild-type residue and position, and the following letter is the substituted residue at that position. HEK cells were transfected with either wild-type or mutant cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (18Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). For ligand binding measurements, cells 2 days after transfection were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 mm EDTA. Ligand binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-Bgt binding (18Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in potassium Ringer's solution, and divided into aliquots for ligand binding. Potassium Ringer's solution contains: 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin, adjusted to a pH of 7.4 with NaOH. Specified concentrations of wild-type or mutant CTx ImI were added 30 min prior to addition of 3.75 nm125I-α-Bgt, which was allowed to bind for 10 min to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer's solution containing 600 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. All experiments were performed at 24 ± 2 °C. Cells were harvested by filtration through Whatman GF-B filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and washed three times with 3 ml of potassium Ringer's solution. Prior to use, filters were soaked in potassium Ringer's solution containing 4% skim milk. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 nm α-Bgt and was typically 1% of the total number of binding sites. The total number of binding sites was determined by incubation with toxin for 120 min. The initial rate of toxin binding was calculated as described (19Sine S.M. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield the fractional occupancy of competing ligand.

For wild-type α7/5HT-3 receptorsk T = 5.83 × 105m−1 s−1. Before we could identify pairs of residues that stabilize the α7-CTx ImI complex, we first needed to identify residues in α7 required for CTx ImI binding. Beginning with the (+) face of the α7 binding site, we mutated key aromatic residues in loops A, B, and C, as well as local flanking residues in each loop (Fig. 2). To determine functional consequences of the mutations, each cDNA was transfected into 293 HEK cells and binding of CTx ImI was measured by competition against the initial rate of 125I-α-Bgt binding. To achieve high expression in 293 HEK cells, all mutations were generated in the α7/5HT-3 chimera, which consists of α7 sequence from the N terminus to the M1 transmembrane domain followed by 5HT-3 sequence to the C terminus (15Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We find that Tyr-195 in loop C provides the dominant source of stabilization of CTx ImI, as shown by the 320-fold loss in affinity produced by Y195T (Fig. 3 and TableI). Similarly, mutation of Tyr-195 to arginine decreases affinity 2500-fold, probably through electrostatic repulsion against one of the three cationic moieties in CTx ImI. On the other hand, mutation of Tyr-195 to phenylalanine does not affect affinity, indicating that an aromatic side chain is required. In addition to Tyr-195, we find that residues in loops A, B, and C contribute to CTx ImI binding, showing 10- to 30-fold changes in affinity for the various mutations; these include Y93T, W149T, Y151T, G153S, R186V, and D197N (Fig. 3 and Table I). Thus, on the (+) face of the binding site, Tyr-195 makes the dominant contribution to CTx ImI affinity, while additional residues in loops A through C make smaller contributions. We next examined key residues in loops I through IV of the (−) face of the binding site (Fig. 2). In contrast to the (+) face, residues of the (−) face contribute only weakly to CTx ImI binding (Fig. 4). The greatest contributions are found in loops II and III, including Thr-77 in loop II and Asn-111, Gln-117, and Pro-120 in loop III. We previously showed that Thr-77 contributes to CTx ImI specificity for α7 neuronal over muscle receptors (15Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11001-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mutation N111S produces an unusual increase rather than decrease in affinity, presumably due to removal of glycosylation. In support of a glycosylation site, mutating the downstream consensus site with S113A has the same effect as N111S. Removing carbohydrate from Asn-111 may increase affinity for CTx ImI by allowing deeper penetration into the binding site. Gln-117 occupies a position equivalent to Tyr-117 in the muscle receptor γ subunit, which stabilizes one of two quaternary nitrogens in DMT (14Fu D.X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Finally, Pro-120 is the first of a pair of vicinal prolines, both highly conserved, that likely stabilize the conformation of loop III. Thus the (−) face of the binding site stabilizes CTx ImI through relatively weak contributions by residues in loops II and III. Because CTx ImI binding is measured by competition against 125I-α-Bgt binding, we determined whether the mutations in α7 affect binding of the reporter ligand itself. We therefore compared rates of125I-α-Bgt association (kT) for wild-type and mutant α7 receptors (TableII). Association rates for125I-α-Bgt are similar for wild-type and mutant α7 receptors, indicating that residues contributing to CTx ImI binding do not affect entry of α-Bgt to the site. To summarize, we have examined key residues in the seven loops in α7 known to contribute to the ligand binding site. We find that Tyr-195 is the major contributor to CTx ImI affinity, and that multiple residues on both the (+) and (−) faces of the binding site are minor contributors. We previously identified key residues in each of the two loops of CTx ImI that contribute to its bioactivity (Fig. 1). In the N-terminal loop, each of three consecutive residues, Asp-5, Pro-6, and Arg-7 is equally important for bioactivity, suggesting that they contribute as an interdependent triad (16Quiram P. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Systematic mutagenesis of each residue indicates that this bioactive triad requires conformational restriction by Pro-6 and proper chain length of the oppositely charged side chains. In the C-terminal loop, Trp-10 contributes to bioactivity through its aromatic ring. Thus, knowing key residues in both CTx ImI and α7, we designed experiments to identify pairs of residues that stabilize the receptor-conotoxin complex. To identify pairs of interacting residues, we focused on residues shown by mutagenesis to provide significant stabilization of the receptor-conotoxin complex. Results for the most strongly interacting pair of residues are shown in Fig.5 A, which displays binding curves for the four possible combinations of wild-type and mutant for the receptor-conotoxin pair Y195T/R7Q (Fig. 5 A). The receptor mutation Y195T reduces affinity for wild-type CTx ImI by 320-fold, while the CTx ImI mutation R7Q reduces affinity for wild-type α7 by 380-fold. However when examined together, the two mutations show no further decrease in affinity, contrary to the 10,000-fold decrease expected if their contributions were additive. On the other hand, results demonstrating non-interacting residues are displayed in Fig. 5 B for the receptor-conotoxin pairY93T/W10T. The receptor mutation Y93T decreases affinity for wild-type CTx ImI by 40-fold, while the CTx ImI mutation W10T decreases affinity for wild-type α7 by 30-fold. The two mutations together decrease affinity by 700-fold, which is purely additive, indicating that Tyr-93 and Trp-10 do not interact. Thus analyses of pairwise mutations in α7 and CTx ImI readily distinguish interacting from non-interacting residues. Thermodynamic mutant cycles analysis has been widely used to identify interactions between pairs of residues in proteins, as well as to estimate the free energy of the interactions (1Ackerman E.J.

However, it is obscure whether NF-κB plays an anti-apoptotic role in nontransformed cells, and it is not clear whether NF-κB inhibits apoptosis triggered by other mediators. We investigated the effect of specific inhibition of NF-κB on cytokine-induced apoptosis of glomerular mesangial cells, which is important in determining the outcome of glomerulonephritis. Cultured rat mesangial cells were stably transfected with the dominant negative mutant inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBαM). IκBαM was resistant to stimulus-dependent degradation and suppressed NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml). IκBαM significantly sensitized mesangial cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner but had no significant effects on the level of apoptosis in the presence of proinflammatory or apoptosis-inducing stimuli including Fas ligand, IL-1α, IL-1β, hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, cycloheximide, or serum deprivation. Moreover, IκBαM-mediated sensitization to TNF-α overcame the protective effect of mesangial cell survival factors present in serum, which usually inhibit killing of mesangial cells by the proapoptotic stimuli used. These data show that inhibition of NF-κB selectively sensitizes primary adult glomerular mesangial cells to TNF-induced apoptosis but not to other mediators of cell death including the Fas ligand.

Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Consequently, NF-κB has attracted attention as a therapeutic target in disorders characterized by persistent inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, recent work from Foxwell et al. (4Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. Martin R.D. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) demonstrated that it is possible to suppress production of TNF-α, a proinflammatory cytokine of key importance in inflammatory diseases, in isolated human macrophages or human rheumatoid joint cell cultures using adenoviral-mediated overexpression of IκBα. However, inhibition of NF-κB at inflamed sites could have additional and probably undesirable consequences. In particular, in a range of transformed/cancer/embryonic cell lines, a blockade of NF-κB sensitized such cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, establishing a potentially “anti-apoptotic” role for the transcription factor (5Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 6Wang C.Y.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). This was further emphasized in studies of mice in which expression of NF-κB components was deleted, because knockout mice lacking the RelA component of NF-κB died before birth by extensive apoptosis of liver cells at days 15–16 of gestation (8Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar), and embryonic fibroblasts taken from RelA knockout mice were highly sensitive to TNF-α-mediated killing (9Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of NF-κB might undesirably increase deletion by apoptosis of cells at inflamed sites, promoting unscheduled cell loss, scarring, and loss of organ function (10Sugiyama H. Kashihara N. Makino H. Yamasaki Y. Ota Z. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an important finding in the studies of adenoviral-mediated IκBα gene transfer by Foxwell et al.(4Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. Martin R.D. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was that infected macrophages were not induced to undergo apoptosis or sensitized to TNF-α, whereas transformed HeLa cells were. This intriguing observation emphasizes that very little is known of the consequences of inhibiting NF-κB in primary cell types resident at inflamed sites and suggests that the NF-κB blockade may not sensitize such cells to proapoptotic stimuli. Therefore, we set out to study the effects of the NF-κB blockade in a primary cell type relevant to inflammation at various sites. Glomerular mesangial cells play crucial roles in glomerular inflammation, regulating blood flow, secreting chemotactic cytokines, and depositing an extracellular matrix. Accumulation of mesangial cells threatens progression of glomerular injury to a functionless scar, but when glomerular disease resolves excess mesangial cells are deleted by apoptosis (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Importantly, mesangial cells in diseased glomeruli and in culture assume the phenotype of myofibroblasts, a tissue cell type that accumulates at sites of inflammation or injury in a range of tissues including the skin, liver, and gut (12Desmouliere A. Redard M. Darby I. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 56-66PubMed Google Scholar, 13Iredale J.P. Benyon R.C. Pickering J. McCullen M. Northrop M. Pawley S. Hovell C. Arthur M.J.P. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2650-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is believed to promote formation of scar tissue at these sites. To achieve specific inhibition of NF-κB, we transfected cultured rat mesangial cells with the dominant negative mutant IκBα (IκBαM), which inhibits NF-κB translocation to the nucleus. IκBαM has both N- and C-terminal mutations and thus is resistant to both basal and stimulus-dependent degradation (7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 15Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). We now report for the first time that 1) inhibition of NF-κB in a primary adult resident tissue cell type relevant to inflammatory disease does sensitize such cells to apoptosis; 2) sensitization of mesangial cells is remarkably selective to TNF-α, not being observed with a range of other proapoptotic stimuli; and 3) TNF-α can trigger apoptosis in IκBαM-transfected cells in the presence of serum-derived survival factors, which normally protect myofibroblast-like mesangial cells from a range of proapoptotic stimuli. The data raise the intriguing concept that when NF-κB is inhibited, TNF-α could serve as a “molecular knife” for removal of excess resident cells from inflamed sites. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated and include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cycloheximide (CHX), and H2O2. Culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium nutrient mix F-12 with glutamax-1) and supplements (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) were purchased from Life Technologies Inc. Recombinant TNF-α and Fas ligand (FasL) were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA) and Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Recombinant IL-1α and IL-1β were gifts from Professor Saklatvala (Kennedy Institute, Charing Cross Hospital, London, United Kingdom). Rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα and anti-IκBβ Ab were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mesangial cells were cultured from isolated glomeruli of normal kidneys of a male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat. Clonal cells were established by a limiting dilutional method and identified as being of mesangial cell phenotype, as described previously (17Kitamura M. Taylor S. Unwin R. Burton S. Shimizu F. Fine L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells overexpressing IκBαM were created as follows. pLIκBαMSN (a gift from Dr. I. Verma, Salk Institute) (7Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) comprising IκBαM cDNA and a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo) were transfected into a helper-free ecotropic packaging line ΩE (18Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of the neomycin analogue G418 (500 μg/ml). Conditioned media of the transfectants were used as sources of the IκBαM retrovirus. In the presence of 10 μg/ml of polybrene, mesangial cells were exposed to a diluted retrovirus, as described before (17Kitamura M. Taylor S. Unwin R. Burton S. Shimizu F. Fine L.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Stable infectants were selected in the presence of G418 (750 μg/ml), and the IκBαM transfectants were established. As control cells, mock-transfected mesangial cells that express neo alone were created (19Yokoo T. Kitamura M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F123-F130PubMed Google Scholar). By light microscopy, the IκBαM and control transfectants had an elongated and stellate morphology and exhibited “hillocks” characteristic of untransfected parental cells. By Northern blot analysis, they expressed mRNA for α-smooth muscle actin at the same level as untransfected cells, 2M. Kitamura, unpublished data. suggesting transfectants have retained most of the phenotypic characteristics of mesangial cells. Rat mesangial cells were seeded at 4000 cells/well in 96-well plates for acridine orange assay or 2 × 106 cells in 162-cm2 flasks for protein extraction and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h the cells achieved 50–60% confluency. Where desired, deprivation of serum as a model of survival factor withdrawal was achieved as described previously (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Mooney A. Jobson T. Bacon R. Kitamura M. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3949-3960PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant TNF-α (10–100 ng/ml), FasL (100 ng/ml), IL-1α (10–100 ng/ml), or IL-1β (10–100 ng/ml) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, H2O2 (100–200 μm), CHX (10 μg/ml), or LPS (0.1–10 μg/ml) was included in medium with or without 10% serum. In FasL experiments, cells were prestimulated by LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h in medium containing 0.5% serum. Cells undergoing apoptosis were recognized and counted by adding the fluorescent dye acridine orange (final concentration, 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) to culture wells as described previously (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Mooney A. Jobson T. Bacon R. Kitamura M. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3949-3960PubMed Google Scholar). This assay has been extensively validated against biochemical, flow cytometric, and electron microscopic assays of apoptosis (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Mooney A. Jobson T. Bacon R. Kitamura M. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3949-3960PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts were prepared according to published methods with some modification (21Guesdon F. Ikebe T. Stylianou E. Warwick-Davies J. Haskill S. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mesangial cells were centrifuged, resuspended in chilled hypotonic buffer (buffer A: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenanthroline, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane, 100 μm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, 10 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate), and centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. They were lysed in a solution of buffer A containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then collected as cytosolic extract. The remaining pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (buffer C: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 100 μm3,4-dichloroisocoumarin), incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant including soluble nuclear protein was collected as nuclear extract. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford protein assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cytosolic extracts (50 μg) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting (21Guesdon F. Ikebe T. Stylianou E. Warwick-Davies J. Haskill S. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm whether the protein extracts had been loaded evenly. Antibody-labeled proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the competition study, synthetic blocking peptides (IκBα and IκBβ, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) were coincubated with the primary Ab. For the negative control study, membranes were treated similarly but without the addition of primary Ab. Nuclear extracts (15 μg) were analyzed by EMSA as described previously with some modification (21Guesdon F. Ikebe T. Stylianou E. Warwick-Davies J. Haskill S. Saklatvala J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 23Stylianou E. O'Neill L.A.J. Rawlinson L. Edbrooke M.R. Woo P. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15836-15841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded wild-type NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) and mutant NF-κB (5′-AGT TGA GGC GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) oligonucleotides were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubation with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). After DNA-binding reaction and electrophoresis, gels were dried and autoradiographed (23Stylianou E. O'Neill L.A.J. Rawlinson L. Edbrooke M.R. Woo P. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15836-15841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of the reaction, competition assays were performed with 100-fold excess of unlabeled wild type, mutant NF-κB, or unrelated oligonucleotides (AP-1, obtained from Promega). The unlabeled probes were added to the binding reaction 5 min before the addition of the labeled probe. Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences were evaluated by a nonparametric test (Mann-Whitney U test). A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To inhibit cytokine-induced NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, we transfected rat mesangial cells with the dominant negative IκBαM cDNA, which is not susceptible to phosphorylation at N-terminal serines 32 and 36 and is therefore resistant to subsequent degradation. In Western blot analysis of the cytosolic extracts from untransfected rat mesangial cells, the expected 37- and 43-kDa polypeptides were detected after incubation with pooled anti-IκBα and anti-IκBβ Ab (Fig.1 A, lane 1). In control transfectants, IκBα and IκBβ proteins were expressed at similar levels to those in untransfected cells (Fig. 1 A,lane 2). As expected on the basis of similar electrophoretic mobility of IκBα and IκBαM, when IκBαM was stably overexpressed in transfected mesangial cells there was an increase in the intensity of IκBα staining relative to IκBβ (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Synthetic blocking peptides of IκBα and IκBβ containing the epitope of the corresponding Ab completely neutralized the binding of the primary Ab at a ratio of 10:1 (peptide:Ab, μg, respectively) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4–6). Incubation without the primary Ab in the presence of the secondary Ab alone also entirely abolished labeling (Fig.1 A, lanes 7–9), demonstrating the specificity of immunoblotting under the conditions employed. We next examined the level of NF-κB in mesangial cell nuclear extracts by EMSA (Fig. 1 B). After stimulation by 10 ng/ml TNF-α without serum for 24 h, extracts from control transfectants revealed three DNA-protein complexes when incubated with the labeled consensus NF-κB probe (Fig. 1 B, lane 1, arrows 1–3). Incubation with the labeled mutant NF-κB probe abrogated the binding to the upper complex, but not to the two lower faster migrating complexes, indicating that only the upper complex was specific for NF-κB (Fig. 1 B, lane 6, arrow). The consensus NF-κB probe did not detect any complexes in the absence of the extracts (Fig. 1 B,lane 2). Competition studies with cold NF-κB, cold mutant, or unrelated oligonucleotides confirmed the specificity of DNA protein binding (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5). We examined the level of expression and degree of modification of cytosolic IκBα and IκBβ in transfected rat mesangial cells after stimulation by TNF-α or IL-1β, two cytokines known both to activate NF-κB in a range of cell types and to play key regulatory roles in inflammatory responses (24Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 25O'Neill L.A.J. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 26Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis showed time-dependent degradation of IκBα proteins both in TNF-α- and in IL-1β-treated control transfectants for periods up to 48 h (Fig.2 A, lanes 7–9 and13–15). However, in IκBαM transfectants IκBαM was stably overexpressed and resistant to stimulus-dependent degradation by TNF-α or IL-1β (Fig. 2 A, lanes 10–12 and 16–18). IκBβ proteins were degraded in IκBαM transfectants after stimulation by the cytokine, suggesting some NF-κB may be available for translocation to the nucleus (Fig.2 A, upper bands in lanes 10–12 and16–18). IκB proteins were not degraded without exposure to cytokines either in control or IκBαM transfectants (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–6). Nuclear extracts were obtained from the same cells as analyzed by Western blot in Fig. 2 A. EMSA studies performed over 48 h demonstrated that NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α- or IL-1β was significantly suppressed in IκBαM transfectants (Fig.2 B, lanes 7–18). NF-κB was not induced without exposure to cytokines either in control or IκBαM transfectants (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–6). Our previous work had established that serum deprivation (withdrawal of survival factors) induces apoptosis in cultured mesangial cells, as assessed by morphological examination by light, fluorescence, and electron microscopy and by biochemical evidence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 20Mooney A. Jobson T. Bacon R. Kitamura M. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3949-3960PubMed Google Scholar). We included TNF-α or IL-1β in our system for induction of apoptosis by serum deprivation and compared the effects of cytokines on apoptosis of mesangial cells constitutively overexpressing IκBαM or control vector (Fig. 3 A). Both cytokines increased the level of apoptosis to some extent as compared with serum deprivation alone in control transfectants, although only the effect of TNF-α (10–100 ng/ml) at 48 h was statistically significant (Fig. 3 A). There were no significant effects of IκBαM overexpression on mesangial cell apoptosis in cultures treated with IL-1β for periods up to 48 h (Fig. 3 A); however, TNF-α (10 ng/ml) significantly increased apoptotic cell death in IκBαM transfectants as compared with control transfectants at 24 h (Fig. 3 A, 46.9% increase in apoptosis). Moreover, the effect of TNF-α on apoptosis in IκBαM was dose- and time- dependent, being greatest at 100 ng/ml TNF-α for 48 h (Fig. 3 A). We further examined the effect of IL-1α (10- 100 ng/ml), another member of the IL-1 family, on mesangial cell apoptosis, but there were no significant differences in apoptosis between control (24.2 ± 0.8%) and IκBαM transfectants (26.4 ± 3.8%) (IL-1α 10 ng/ml at 24 h, n= 4). Overexpression of IκBαM also had no significant effects on the basal level of mesangial cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (Fig. 3 A). We examined the protective effect of serum against cytokine-mediated apoptosis in control or IκBαM transfectants (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of 10% serum in the medium, less than 2% of mesangial cells were apoptotic, a background level of cell turnover compatible with previous studies (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) did not significantly increase apoptosis in control transfectants in the presence of 10% serum. However, IκBαM significantly sensitized mesangial cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis even in the presence of serum containing survival factors for these cells (Fig. 3 B). IκBαM significantly inhibited NF-κB activation induced by TNF-α or IL-1β in the presence of serum as judged by EMSA (data not shown). Because our data indicated that a blockade of NF-κB by IκBαM sensitized mesangial cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-α but had no sensitizing effect toward proapoptotic serum deprivation or to IL-1β and IL-1α, which can induce mesangial cell apoptosis under particular conditions (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 27Liu Z.H. Striker G.E. Stetler-Stevenson M. Fukushima P. Patel A. Striker L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1595-C1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we went on to examine whether IκBαM might sensitize mesangial cells to apoptosis induced by other stimuli. An impressive body of data has implicated reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis (28Diamond J.R. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1992; 19: 292-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), in activation of NF-κB in some cell types (29Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar), and in triggering apoptosis (30Buttke T.M. Sandstrom P.A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 7-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar). Thus, earlier studies reported that reactive oxygen species generated by H2O2induced apoptosis in cultured mesangial cells (31Sugiyama H. Kashihara N. Makino H. Yamasaki Y. Ota Z. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2357-2363PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sandau K. Pfeilschifter J. Brune B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4938-4946PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yokoo T. Kitamura M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2886-2892PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 increased apoptosis both in control and in IκBαM transfectants in a dose-dependent manner at 24 h. IκBαM did not significantly promote or suppress oxidant-induced apoptosis either in the presence or absence of serum (Fig. 4 A). In keeping with earlier studies of murine mesangial cells treated with H2O2 (34Satriano J. Schlondorff D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1629-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), no evidence of NF-κB activation was seen by EMSA, however (Fig.5 A). LPS is known to activate NF-κB in human mesangial cells (35Guijarro C. Kim Y. Schoonover C.M. Massy Z.A. O'Donnell M.P. Kasiske B.L. Keane W.F. Kashtan C.E. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1996; 11: 990-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we confirmed this in rat mesangial cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 5 B). LPS had no significant effects on apoptosis either in control or IκBαM transfectants (Fig. 4 B), although NF-κB activation by LPS was significantly suppressed in IκBαM as analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 5 B). In the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, LPS induces apoptosis in endothelial cells (36Hu X. Yee E. Harlan J.M. Wong F. Karsan A. Blood. 1998; 92: 2759-2765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in mesangial cells LPS plus CHX did not significantly increase apoptosis in control or IκBαM transfectants (Fig. 4 B).Figure 5Effect of hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, or Fas ligand on NF-κB activation. Rat mesangial cells transfected with control vector (A and B, lanes 1–3;C, lanes 1, 2, 5, and6) or IκBαM (A and B, lanes 4–6; C, lanes 3 and 4) were incubated with H2O2 (A), LPS (B), or FasL (C) in serum-free conditions. Nuclear extracts (15 μg) were analyzed by EMSA using the32P-labeled consensus (A and B; andC, lanes 1–4 and 6) or mutant (C,lane 5) NF-κB probe. Extracts from TNF-α-treated control transfectants at 24 h were used as a positive control for the specific NF-κB complex in FasL experiments (C, lane 6). The position of the specific NF-κB complex is indicated by an arrow. Nonspecific complexes detected by the mutant probe are indicated by arrows a-d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The TNF-α homologue FasL is a well characterized proapoptotic stimulus. In keeping with data on murine mesangial cells (37Ortiz-Arduan A. Danoff T.M. Kalluri R. Gonzalez-Cuadrado S. Karp S.L. Elkon K. Neilson E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1193-F1201PubMed Google Scholar), pre-stimulation with LPS sensitized rat mesangial cells to FasL-induced apoptosis, but there was no significant difference in apoptosis between control and IκBαM transfectants (Fig. 4 C). Moreover, FasL-induced apoptosis did not overcome the survival effect of serum on either transfectant (Fig. 4 D) nor did it activate NF-κB (Fig. 5 C). Nevertheless, it was striking that sensitization of mesangial cells to apoptosis by IκBαM was selective for TNF-α but not observed with its homologue FasL. This study provides important new insights into the effects of inhibiting NF-κB in a primary adult resident tissue cell type known to play important roles in inflammatory disease. Indeed, because glomerular mesangial cells adopt a myofibroblastic phenotype under the conditions employed, the data may be relevant to regulation of myofibroblast numbers at inflamed sites elsewhere. For the first time it has been shown that, by contrast with macrophages (4Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. Martin R.D. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the blockade of NF-κB sensitized primary tissue cells from the mesangium of the glomerulus to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, this sensitization by the NF-κB blockade was selective in that we observed no increase in susceptibility to other proapoptotic stimuli, including H2O2, FasL, IL-1β, IL-1α, LPS, and cycloheximide. Lastly, despite the generally protective effects of mesangial cell survival factors in serum, which include insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-II and basic fibroblast growth factor (20Mooney A. Jobson T. Bacon R. Kitamura M. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3949-3960PubMed Google Scholar) and which inhibit induction of apoptosis by various stimuli, serum did not inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells transfected with IκBαM. To date, studies of the regulatory effects of NF-κB activation upon cell survival and apoptosis have been restricted to transformed/malignant/embryonic cells (5Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) or to leukocytes (4Foxwell B. Browne K. Bondeson J. Clarke C. Martin R.D. Brennan F. Feldmann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8211-8215Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 38Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G. Fujihara S. Fallow S.N. Haslett C. Rossi A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4309-4318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The effects of the NF-κB blockade in primary adult tissue cells have been unknown, but were important to determine because of a growing interest in NF-κB as a therapeutic target in inflammatory disease (1Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4299) Google Scholar). Indeed, glomerular cells from the adult kidney were of particular interest in view of a report that rather than an anti-apoptotic role, NF-κB activation induces apoptosis in the human 293 embryonic kidney cell line (39Grimm S. Bauer M.K.A. Baeuerle P.A. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our finding that primary adult mesangial cells are indeed rendered susceptible to TNF-α-induced apoptosis by a blockade of NF-κB, consistent with an anti-apoptotic role for NF-κB, should not obscure the fact that NF-κB inhibition failed to affect apoptosis induced by H2O2 or FasL, indicating that apoptosis triggered in mesangial cells by such stimuli does not involve a role for NF-κB; these data are supported by lack of demonstrable NF-κB activation in such circumstances. Perhaps the most intriguing findings in this study were that the blockade of NF-κB selectively sensitized mesangial cells to TNF-α-induced apoptosis and that this sensitization was still demonstrable in the presence of survival factors in serum, which are known to protect mesangial cells against many proapoptotic stimuli. Although highly speculative, the possibility is raised that selective sensitization to TNF-α might enable the combination of this cytokine and the NF-κB blockade to be used as a molecular knife to pare away excess mesangial tissue cells where these threaten accumulation of abnormal extracellular matrix and progression of glomerular inflammation to a functionless scar. However, because mesangial cell apoptosis may be a double-edged sword (40Savill J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Kidney Int. 1996; 49 (suppl.): 14-17Google Scholar), being beneficial in the early hypercellular stage of inflammatory injury (11Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) but deleterious once scarring ensues because of undesirable loss of resident cells (10Sugiyama H. Kashihara N. Makino H. Yamasaki Y. Ota Z. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), the data also emphasize that attempts to ameliorate inflammation by inhibition of NF-κB could have undesirable consequences. Consequently, it follows that future work on NF-κB-mediated protection of primary cells from the proapoptotic effects of TNF-α should address whether regulatory pathways defined in transformed cells are relevant (41Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). Roles for the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 and TNF receptor-associated factors 1 and 2 should be sought, because these might represent therapeutic targets much more specially involved in the protection against TNF-α-induced apoptosis than NF-κB itself. To conclude, this study extends known anti-apoptotic roles of NF-κB to primary tissue cells and emphasizes that the blockade of NF-κB can selectively sensitize such cells to apoptosis induced by TNF-α, even in the presence of protective survival factors.

https://openalex.org/W1987420251,"Methylation of DNA is important in many organisms and essential in mammals. Nucleobases can be methylated at the adenine-N 6, cytosine-N 4, or cytosine-C 5 atoms by specific DNA methyltransferases. We show here that the M.EcoRV, M.EcoRI, and Escherichia coli dam methyltransferases as well as the N- and C-terminal domains of the M.FokI enzyme, which were formerly all classified as adenine-N 6 DNA methyltransferases, also methylate cytosine residues at position N 4. Kinetic analyses demonstrate that the rate of methylation of cytosine residues by M.EcoRV and the M.FokI enzymes is reduced by only 1–2 orders of magnitude in relation to methylation of adenines. This result shows that although these enzymes methylate DNA in a sequence specific manner, they have a low substrate specificity with respect to the target base. This unexpected finding has implications on the mechanism of adenine-N 6 DNA methyltransferases. Sequence comparisons suggest that adenine-N 6 and cytosine-N 4 methyltransferases have changed their reaction specificity at least twice during evolution, a model that becomes much more likely given the partial functional overlap of both enzyme types. In contrast, methylation of adenine residues by the cytosine-N 4 methyltransferase M.BamHI was not detectable. On the basis of our results, we suggest that adenine-N 6 and cytosine-N 4 methyltransferases should be grouped into one enzyme family.

At least in mammals it is absolutely essential (8Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). In prokaryotes, methylation of DNA is involved in processes like post-replicative repair (9Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24727-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and control of DNA replication (10Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, DNA methylation is required in restriction-modification systems found in almost all bacteria (11Heitman J. Setlow J.K. Genetic Engineering (N Y). 15. Plenum Press, New York1993: 57-108Google Scholar). Today, over 200 prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MTases)1 have been identified and characterized; most of which are components of restriction-modification systems (12Noyer-Weidner M. Trautner T.A. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993Google Scholar, 13Cheng X. Curr. Opin. Struct.

These enzymes recognize short DNA sequences and specifically methylate these sequences at a defined position yielding 6-methyladenine, 4-methylcytosine, or 5-methylcytosine. All MTases contain a weakly conserved F_G_G amino acid motif responsible for the interaction with the cofactor AdoMet. Amino acid sequence comparisons show that cytosine-C 5 MTase share nine additional conserved amino acid motifs (12Noyer-Weidner M. Trautner T.A. Jost J.P. Saluz H.P. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Significance. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1993Google Scholar, 15Wilson G.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In contrast, adenine-N 6 MTases are much more heterogenic. Besides the F_G_G motif, they only contain one moderately conserved (D/N)PP(Y/F) motif, which forms part of the active center of these enzymes. Some additional weakly conserved motifs could only be identified in structure-guided alignments (17Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cytosine-N 4 MTases also contain a set of motifs comparable with adenine-N 6 MTases. However, most of them contain an SPP(Y/F) motif instead of the (D/N)PP(Y/F) motif present in adenine-N 6Mtases 2Evidently, at least one cytosine-N 4 MTase (M.BamHI) has a DPPY sequence in its active site. (17Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The conserved motifs of adenine-N 6 and cytosine-N 4 MTases may appear in variable distance and order. According to the arrangement of the motifs these enzymes can be subdivided into three groups, α, β, and γ (15Wilson G.G. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 259-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,17Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Most cytosine-N 4 MTases belong to the β group, however, some are members of the α group. MTases of all classes show structural similarity in their catalytic domains comprising the overall fold and topology, the cofactor binding site and location of the catalytic center (18Cheng X.

All DNA MTases studied so far prefer binding to substrates that contain a mismatch base pair or even an abasic site at the target position (27Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J.

This result can be rationalized because base flipping requires disruption of the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds of the target base, which is facilitated if the target base forms weaker hydrogen bonds to its partner base. However, these results also imply that the target base may not be recognized very accurately by MTases, at least in the ground state of the enzyme·DNA complex. Given this finding and the structural similarity of adenine-N 6 and cytosine-N 4 MTases as well as the similarity of the active site sequence motifs of both enzyme families, the question arises whether adenine-N 6 MTase might also be able to methylate cytosine residues and vice versa. HPLC-purified oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Interactiva (Ulm, Germany). To anneal double-stranded substrates the complementary oligonucleotides were mixed, heated to 90 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to 20 °C. The following double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates were used: RV_L20, d(GATCGTAGATATCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGATATCTACGATC); RV_ME, d(GATCGTAGATATCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); RV_MM, d(GATCGTAGmATATCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); RV_C/A, d(GATCGTAGCTATCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); RV_CG, d(GATCGTAGCTATCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGATAGCTACGATC); Fok_up_ME, d(CGCGGCCGGATGCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGCmATCCGGCCGCG); Fok_low_ME, d(CGCGGCCGGmATGCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGCATCCGGCCGCG); Fok_MM, d(CGCGGCCGGmATGCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGCmATCCGGCCGCG); Fok_up_C/A, d(CGCGGCCGGCTGCCCGGGC)/ d(GCCCGGGCmATCCGGCCGCG); Fok_low_C/A, d(CGCGGCCGGmATGCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGCCTCCGGCCGCG); RI_L20, d(GATCGTAGAATTCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGAATTCTACGATC); RI_C/A, d(GATCGTAGACTTCGCATCGA)/d(TCGATGCGAATTCTACGATC); dam_L19, d(CGCGGCCGGATCCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGGATCCGGCCGCG); dam_C/A, d(CGCGGCCGGATCCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGGCTCCGGCCGCG); Bam_L19, d(CGCGGCCGGATCCCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGGATCCGGCCGCG); and Bam_A/C, d(CGCGGCCGGATACCCGGGC)/d(GCCCGGGGATCCGGCCGCG). For the methylation kinetics with M.EcoRV the following oligonucleotides, which are biotinylated at the 5′ end of the lower strand, were used: RV_ME_Bt, d(GATCGTAGATATCGCATCGA)/d(Bt-TTTTCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); RV_MM_Bt, d(GATCGTAGmATATCGCATCGA)/d(Bt-TTTTCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC); and RV_C/A_Bt, d(GATCGTAGCTATCGCATCGA)/d(Bt-TTTTCGATGCGmATATCTACGATC). [methyl-3H]AdoMet (2.68 TBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. [methyl-14C]AdoMet (1.85 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To avoid degradation, AdoMet was stored in small aliquots at −20 °C and thawed only once. Cloning and purification of M.EcoRV has been described (31Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cloning of M.FokI(1–367) and M.FokI(335–647) is detailed by Leismann et al. (35Leismann O. Roth M. Friedrich T. Wende W. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this study, an N-terminal His6-fusion protein of M.FokI(1–367) was used. M.FokI(1–367) and M.FokI(335–647) were purified following the same protocol as M.EcoRV, except that in the case of M.FokI(335–647) cells were lysed in 30 mmKPi, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% (v/v) lubrol. All enzyme preparations were pure at least to 95%. M.BamHI, M.EcoRI, and E. coli dam MTase were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. Oligonucleotide substrates (20 μm) were methylated in the presence of 0.76 μm [methyl-3H]AdoMet at 37 °C for 3 h. Methylation reactions with M.EcoRV (0.9 μm) were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Methylation reactions with M.FokI(1–367) (3.7 μm) and M.FokI(335–647) (9.6 μm) were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 ng/μl bovine serum albumin. Methylation reactions with M.EcoRI (4 units/μl), M.BamHI (4 units/μl), and dam MTase (8 units/μl) were carried out in the buffers recommended by the supplier. After the methylation reactions 10 μl of the reaction mixture was incubated with 5 mmMgCl2, 3Depending on the EDTA concentration, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm free Mg2+. 2 μg (3.6 × 10−3 units) P1 nuclease (Sigma), and 1.4 μg (1400 units) Serratia marcescens nuclease for 16 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 30 μl. Then, 2 μl (2 units) of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 4 μl 10× SAP buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmMgCl2), and 4 μl of water were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were heated to 75 °C for 2 min and mixed with 120 μl of HPLC buffer A (100 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 6.5). 80 μl of the mixture were applied onto a reversed-phase HPLC column (Apex 1-octadecylsilyl(C-18), 5 μm particle size, 25 × 0.45 cm purchased from Jones Chromatography, Llanbradach, Wales) equilibrated with buffer A. HPLC runs were performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at an ambient temperature using a biphasic linear gradient consisting of buffers A and B (100 mm triethylammonium acetate, pH 6.5, 30% acetonitrile): t = 0 min, 0% buffer B; t = 40 min, 20% buffer B; t= 55 min, 100% buffer B. The column eluate was monitored at 260 nm. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and radioactivity analyzed by scintillation counting. The identity of the nucleosides was confirmed by injection of standard dC, dT, dA, and dG (Sigma) that were treated with nucleases under the same conditions as the oligodeoxynucleotides. Methylation reactions with M.EcoRV were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 ng/μl bovine serum albumin in the presence of 0.76 μm labeled [methyl-3H]AdoMet at an ambient temperature. Oligonucleotide substrates used in these experiments carry a biotin group on one end. Enzyme and oligonucleotide concentrations were varied between 0.1 and 1 μm. Separation of methylated oligonucleotides and free AdoMet was performed using avidin-coated microtiter plates. To coat microtiter plates with avidin, 100 μl of avidin (10 μg/ml, Sigma) in 100 mm NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) were pipetted into each well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed five times with 200 μl of PBST (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmK2HPO4, 0.05% v/v Tween 50, pH 7.2). 10 μl of 10 mm unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) in 10 mmH2SO4 were pipetted into each well, and an aliquot of the methylation reaction mixture containing 2 pmol oligonucleotide was added. PBST was added to a total volume of 50 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min to allow binding of the oligonucleotides to the microtiter plate. The wells were washed five times with 200 μl of PBST supplemented with 500 mm NaCl to remove the unreacted AdoMet and enzyme·AdoMet complexes. To quantify the radioactivity incorporated into DNA, the DNA was degraded using 0.7 μg (700 units) S. marcescens nuclease in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2 for 30 min at an ambient temperature, and the released radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. As shown in Fig. 4 (only experiments with M.EcoRV were carried out with the biotin/avidin assay), the assay is linear with respect to time and the signal/noise ratio is much better than in the curves determined with the thin layer chromatography assay. Further controls showed that the assay is very sensitive and accurate. 4M. Roth and A. Jeltsch, manuscript in preparation. Methylation reactions with the M.FokI enzymes were carried out in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at an ambient temperature as described (35Leismann O.

[methyl-14C]AdoMet was used at a concentration of 50 μm. DNA binding by M.EcoRV was assayed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mm sinefungin as described (31Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J.

Adenine-N 6 and cytosine-N 4 MTases have similar structures and catalytic centers. Moreover, biochemical evidence suggests that MTases do not very accurately recognize their target base (27Allan B.W.

Hence, the question arose whether adenine-N 6MTases might be able to methylate cytosine residues at theN 4 position, which is the subject of this study. Most of our experiments were carried out with the M.EcoRV and M.FokI adenine-N 6 MTases. M.EcoRV recognizes GATATC and methylates the first adenine residue within this sequence (36Nwosu V.U. Connolly B.A. Halford S.E. Garnett J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3705-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). M.FokI is a tandem enzyme consisting of two fused MTases that are catalytically active independently of each other (35Leismann O. Roth M. Friedrich T. Wende W. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Looney M.C. Moran L.S. Jack W.E. Feehery G.R. Benner J.S. Slatko B.E. Wilson G.G.

Both of the M.FokI enzymes recognize the asymmetric DNA sequence GGATG/CATCC (39Sugisaki H. Kanazawa S. Gene. 1981; 16: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 40Landry D. Looney M.C.

Gene. 1989; 77: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain modifies the upper GGATG-strand, the C-terminal domain has a strong preference for the lower CATCC-strand (35Leismann O.

In this study we have used purified preparations of both individual domains, viz. M.FokI(1–367) comprising amino acid 1–367 and M.FokI(335–647) comprising amino acids 335–647 (35Leismann O. Roth M. Friedrich T. Wende W. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). First we tested whether M.EcoRV might flip a cytosine residue located at the target position out of the DNA helix, a prerequisite for enzymatic activity. To this end, the binding constants of M.EcoRV to the canonical hemimethylated substrate RV_ME containing a GATATC/GmATATC site and to RV_C/A were determined. RV_C/A contains a GCTATC/GmATATC site in which the unmethylated target adenine of RV_ME is replaced by cytosine and the “target” cytosine is located in a C:T base mismatch. The hemimethylated substrate RV_ME is bound with an affinity ofK a = 5 × 106m−1, similar to binding constants determined for an unmethylated 20-mer (31Jeltsch A. Friedrich T. Roth M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and 30/33-mer (41Szczelkun M.D. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10724-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast the RV_C/A substrate is bound with K a = 6 × 107m−1. This preference of M.EcoRV for binding to the mismatch substrate is very similar to results obtained with other mismatch substrates (30Cal S. Connolly B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 490-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 32Jeltsch A. Roth M. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It suggests that M.EcoRV flips cytosine residues if they are located in a GCTATC/GmATATC sequence. To find out if cytosine residues can be modified by adenine-N 6 MTases, the nature of the methylated base must be identified. To this end oligonucleotides containing adenine and cytosine residues at the MTase target position were methylated in vitro using labeled [methyl-3H]AdoMet. In most experiments we used hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrates in which one DNA strand is already methylated at the target position. The target adenine in the other DNA strand is replaced by cytosine such that the resulting C/A substrates bear a C:T mismatch at the target site, viz. GCTATC/GmATATC (RV_C/A) for M.EcoRV, GGCTG/CmATCC (Fok_up_C/A) for M.FokI(1–367) and CCTCC/GGmATG (Fok_low_C/A) for M.FokI(335–647). As a control hemimethylated substrates,viz. GATATC/GmATATC (RV_ME) for M.EcoRV, GGATG/CmATCC (Fok_up_ME) for M.FokI(1–367) and CATCC/GGmATG (Fok_low_ME) for M.FokI(335–647) and fully methylated substrates were employed, viz. GmATATC/GmATATC for M.EcoRV (RV_MM) and GGmATG/CmATCC (Fok_MM) for M.FokI(1–367) and M.FokI(335–647). After the methylation reaction, the oligonucleotides were digested to mononucleosides, and the mixture of mononucleosides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. Under the experimental conditions a baseline separation of all nucleosides and AdoMet is achieved.N 4-Methylcytosine elutes from the reversed-phase column after 16.5 min and 6-methyladenine after 45.5 min. Both are well separated from any other base and unreacted AdoMet (Fig.1). As expected, incubation of the normal substrates with M.EcoRV, M.FokI(1–367), or M.FokI(335–647) and labeled AdoMet results in strong methylation of adenine residues but no methylation occurs at cytosine residues (Fig. 2, dashed lines). If fully methylated reference substrates are used, again no methylated cytosine is detectable (data not shown). In contrast, if the C/A substrates are incubated with the corresponding MTase no 6-methyladenine is detectable, 5The small peak eluting after 45 min in the reaction with M.EcoRV represents a degradation product of AdoMet that is observed even in runs without oligonucleotide and enzyme under these conditions. but in all reactions with C/A substrates, a significant amount of 4methylcytosine is formed (Fig. 2, continuous lines). This result is highly reproducible and the amount of 4-methylcytosine is far beyond any background fluctuations. We conclude that all three adenine MTases studied are able to methylate cytosine residues. To find out if this behavior is a general property of adenine-N 6 MTases, we have carried out additional experiments with M.EcoRI (recognition sequence GAATTC, modified base is underlined) and E. colidam MTase (recognition sequence GATC). In these experiments, unmethylated substrates containing a cytosine at the target position in one DNA strand are used, viz. GCATTC/GAATTC for M.EcoRI(RI_C/A) and GCTC/GATC for the dam MTase (dam_C/A). Both substrates are modified at the target adenines in the lower DNA strand with good yields (data not shown). Whereas in both cases no 4-methylcytosine is observed with the control substrates (RI_L20 and dam_L19), a small but significant 4-methylcytosine peak appears with the C/A substrates (Fig. 3, Aand B). This result demonstrates that M.EcoRI and the dam MTase also modify cytosine residues. However, smaller amounts of 4-methylcytosine are detected than with M.EcoRV and both M.FokI enzymes, presumably because M.EcoRV and both M.FokI enzymes were available at high concentrations and used in the assays in micromolar concentrations, whereas M.EcoRI and the dam MTase were commercial enzyme preparations containing much lower concentrations of enzyme. We conclude from these results that most, if not all, adenine-N 6 MTases also modify cytosine residues at position N 4, a very unexpected finding. These experiments demonstrate that cytosine residues can be methylated by adenine-N 6 MTases if they are located in a C:T mismatch base pair at the target position of the enzyme. However, we have shown that these mismatch substrates are better bound at least by M.EcoRV, and similar results were also obtained with other MTases (27Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2368-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 33Klimasauskas S. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1388-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Yang A.S. Shen J.-C. Zingg J.-M. Mi S. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Hence, the question arises whether the methylation of cytosine residues by adenine-N 6MTases depends on the fact that the cytosine is located in a base mismatch in the C/A substrate. To answer this question, an additional substrate has been used for M.EcoRV that contains a GCTATC/GATAGC site (RV_CG). Thus, RV_CG contains a GCTATC “star” site of M.EcoRV that differs in one base pair from GATATC and not only in one nucleotide as the C/A substrates. In this substrate the target cytosine is base paired to a guanine in the other DNA strand to form a G:C base pair that is even stronger than A:T base pair in the canonical recognition sequence. If this substrate is incubated with M.EcoRV 4-methylcytosine is formed although less than with the GCTATC/GmATATC substrate (Fig.3 C). This result shows that the methylation of cytosine residues can occur in regular DNA and is not dependent on the facilitated flipping of this base when it is located in a base mismatch. It was tempting to investigate whether the cytosine-N 4 MTase M.BamHI (recognition sequence: GGATCC) could modify adenine residues. To this end a substrate was used in which the target cytosine of M.BamHI is replaced by an adenine in one DNA strand, i.e. GGATAC/GGATCC (Bam_A/C). This substrate is methylated by M.BamHI at the target cytosine in the lower DNA strand (data not shown), but no formation of 6-methyladenine could be detected (Fig. 3 D). However, given the low amounts of 4-methylcytosine observed in the reactions with commercial enzymes, the quantitative meaning of this result remains unclear so far. Moreover, it is uncertain whether this result represents a common property of all cytosine-N 4MTases. Taken together, all data presented so far demonstrate that adenine-N 6 MTases can also modify cytosine residues at position N 4, a result that has not been described before. Hence, we have tried to verify this conclusion by independent experimental evidence. To this end, we have measured the rate of methylation of the C/A substrates by M.EcoRV and the two M.FokI enzymes. These experiments were car"

https://openalex.org/W2320152988,"p51, a novel family member of human p53, is a recently identified candidate tumor suppressor gene mapped at chromosome 3q28. Like p53, p51 was found to activate p21Waf1/Cip1 and to induce apoptosis. Since the DNA loss at 3q is reported in several cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we screened for mutations in p51A (TAp63gamma), an isoform of p51 with short C-terminal region, in 80 NSCLCs as well as 85 breast cancers by RT-PCR single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. In NSCLCs, p51 was expressed in most tumors at variable levels and we found three missense and one silent mutations: Gln31His (transactivation domain) in two tumors, Ala148Pro (DNA-binding domain) and Leu248Leu (DNA-binding domain). In the tumor with Ala148Pro or the silent mutation, only the mutant gene appeared to be expressed. The modified FASAY method to test the ability of yeast expressing p51A cDNA to grow in medium lacking histidine has revealed that Ala148Pro results in a loss of function, while Gln31His does not. In contrast to NSCLC, no mutation was observed in all 85 breast cancers by the similar method. Our results suggest that, because of infrequent mutation, p51 may not be a Knudson type tumor suppressor in most NSCLCs and breast cancers. Nevertheless, in at least a part of NSCLC, p51 may play a certain role in carcinogenesis in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2320166014,"The HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax is required for high level viral transcription and is strongly linked to HTLV-I - associated malignant transformation. Tax stimulates HTLV-I transcription through high affinity binding to the KIX domain of CBP, a pleiotropic coactivator. Several cellular proteins, including c-jun, also bind to KIX and utilize CBP as a coactivator. To test whether Tax binding to KIX may disable cellular CBP function, we examined the potential interplay between Tax and c-jun for binding to KIX. We show that Tax represses the transcription function of c-jun in vivo and demonstrate that both transcription factors bind to an overlapping minimal region of KIX in vitro. c-jun binding to KIX is displaced by Tax, indicating that their binding is mutually exclusive and providing a molecular basis for the observed repression. The competition between Tax and cellular transcription factors for CBP represents a novel pathway for HTLV-I dependent deregulation of gene expression, and may have significant implications for cellular homeostasis and transformation in the HTLV-I infected T-cell."
https://openalex.org/W2017035064,"The role of adenosine receptor in regulation of insulin-induced activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and protein kinase B was studied in isolated rat adipocytes. Rat adipocytes are known to spontaneously release adenosine, which in turn binds and stimulates the adenosine A1 receptors on the cells. In the present study, we observed that degradation of this adenosine by adenosine deaminase attenuated markedly the insulin-induced accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), a product of PI 3-kinase. p-Aminophenylacetyl xanthine amine congener (PAPA-XAC), an inhibitor of the adenosine A1 receptor, also inhibited the insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation. When extracellular adenosine was inactivated by adenosine deaminase, phenylisopropyladenosine, an adenosine A1receptor agonist, potentiated the insulin-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Insulin-induced activation of protein kinase B, the activity of which is controlled by the lipid products of PI 3-kinase, was also potentiated by adenosine. Prostaglandin E2, another activator of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein in these cells, potentiated the insulin actions. Thus, the receptors coupling to the GTP-binding protein were found to positively regulate the production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a putative second messenger for insulin actions, in physiological target cells of insulin.

Because adenosine exerts its effect through the adenosine A1 receptor coupling to a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein, another activator of the GTP-binding protein, prostaglandin E2 also affects the insulin sensitivity (5Olefsky J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 75: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effect of adenosine is not accompanied by changes in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and can be observed even when cellular cAMP was maintained at high concentrations (6Kuroda M. Honnor R.C. Cushman S.W. Londos C. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Honnor R.C. Naghshineh S. Cushman S.W. Wolff J. Londos C. Simpson I.A. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus adenosine action on the insulin sensitivity is considered to be independent of its inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which phosphorylates the 3-OH position of phosphoinositides, is a key signaling enzyme in insulin-induced activation of glucose uptake (8Shepherd P.R.

Studies using either inhibitors of PI 3-kinase such as wortmannin and LY294002 or a dominant negative mutants of PI 3-kinase have demonstrated that PI 3-kinase is necessary for the metabolic action of insulin (9Okada T.

Although the precise mechanism by which PI 3-kinase regulates the glucose transport system is not completely understood, lipid products of PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), are expected to function as second messengers. In this regard, the lipid products are reported to activate protein kinase B (PKB) directly (15Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar), or indirectly through activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases (16Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

Because the mechanism by which adenosine changes insulin sensitivity has not been understood, we examined whether adenosine exerts any effect on insulin-induced activation of PI 3-kinase in rat adipocytes. We observed that adenosine enhanced both the insulin-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and the insulin-induced activation of PKB by a mechanism independent of its inhibitory action on adenylyl cyclase.

All other reagents from commercial sources were of analytical grade. Epididymal fat pads from male Wistar rats weighing 100–120 g were cut into small pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a medium consisting of 130 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% (w/v) collagenase. The digested tissues were filtered through a double-layered nylon stocking and the filtrate was centrifuged at 600 × g for 3 min. The floated cells were then washed three times by suspension and flotation in buffers used for the assays. The isolated adipocytes were washed with an incubation medium consisting of 130 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and suspended at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml in the same medium supplemented with 0.2 mCi/ml of carrier-free 32Pi. The cells (0.2 ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with or without adenosine deaminase, PAPA-XAC, or wortmannin and then for 10 min with or without insulin. When the effects of PGE2, DDA, or PIA were examined, the chemicals were added 5 min before the insulin addition. The reaction was allowed to proceed in a volume of 0.35 ml before being stopped by mixing with 50 μl of 8% (w/v) HClO4. The mixture was mixed with 1.5 ml of CHCl3/methanol (1: 2), stirred vigorously, and then mixed successively with 0.5 ml of CHCl3 and 0.5 ml of 8% (w/v) HClO4. The organic phase was washed once with a CHCl3-saturated solution containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1% HClO4before being concentrated to 0.1 ml. An aliquot (5 μl) of the extract was spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 plate, which had been impregnated with 1.2% (w/v) potassium oxalate in methanol/water (2: 3) and heated at 110 °C for 20 min.

After the incubation, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 600 μl of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.27m sucrose, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 18 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g and the supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of anti-PKBα antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were collected using protein G-Sepharose beads and the beads were washed 4 times with buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 15 μl of buffer B containing 0.4 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μg/μl histone H2B and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were cooled in an ice-bath and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants (15 μl) were transferred to tubes containing an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer. After being heated at 100 °C for 2 min, aliquots of the sample were spotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were washed 8 times with 2 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 100 mm NaCl, and radioactivity remained on the filters was determined. Stimulation of the32Pi-labeled adipocytes with 0.1 μm insulin caused an increased incorporation of radioactivity into a phospholipid fraction corresponding to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, a product of PI 3-kinase (Fig.1). Treatment of the cells with 0.3 μm wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, abolished the insulin-induced production of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. LY294002, another inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, also prevented the [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production at a concentration of 0.3 mm (data not shown). Rat adipocytes spontaneously release adenosine, which in turn binds to the A1 receptors on the cells. Because degradation of this adenosine by addition of adenosine deaminase is reported to modulate the insulin action on glucose uptake (1Schwabe U. Ebert R. Erbler H.C. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 1973; 276: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we examined whether the insulin-induced production of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is affected by the enzyme. Incubation of the adipocytes with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase before the insulin addition effectively suppressed the insulin-induced production of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Fig. 1). In this experiment, the radioactivity in the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 spot from the cells treated with adenosine deaminase was 30.2% of that from the untreated cells. Fig. 2 A shows typical dose-dependent curves of insulin in the presence or absence of adenosine deaminase. Insulin induced a dose-dependent increase in the [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation with the lowest effective concentration around 0.3 nm. Treatment of cells with adenosine deaminase caused a 62 ± 14.5% decrease in the insulin action (mean ± S.E. from four separate experiments). Half-maximal effects of insulin in the presence or absence of adenosine deaminase were not significantly different. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 peaked within 1 min after stimulation with insulin. The increase could still be observed at 10 min after the start of stimulation. The addition of 0.3 μm wortmannin at 1 min after insulin caused a rapid decrease in [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, indicating a rapid turnover of this lipid product. Adenosine deaminase suppressed the accumulation without causing marked changes in these kinetic properties. If the inhibitory action of adenosine deaminase is really via degradation of adenosine, prevention of adenosine binding to the A1 receptor by pharmacological tools is also expected to suppress the insulin action. PAPA-XAC and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, inhibitors of the adenosine A1 receptors, inhibited the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production at concentrations of 5 and 10 μm, respectively (data not shown, but see Fig. 5 for PAPA-XAC). Thus adenosine deaminase was considered to modulate the insulin-induced accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by eliminating the adenosine action on the A1 receptors on the adipocytes. The above results suggested that the spontaneously released adenosine in the absence of adenosine deaminase or the A1 receptor antagonists potentiated the insulin action on the accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Thus we next intended to directly show that stimulation of the A1 receptors potentiates the insulin-induced accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 under the condition where the extracellular adenosine was depleted. For this purpose, PIA, a poorly hydrolyzable analogue of adenosine, was utilized. When the spontaneously released adenosine was inactivated by adenosine deaminase, PIA effectively enhanced the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). The effect of PIA on insulin action could not be observed when adenosine deaminase was not included in the incubation mixture, indicating that the spontaneously released adenosine caused nearly full activation of the A1 receptors in the absence of adenosine deaminase. Adenosine A1 receptor is a member of the receptors coupling to pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins. Thus we next examined the effect of pertussis toxin on insulin-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. After treatment of rat adipocytes with 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin for 45 min, the action of insulin was markedly reduced (by 66 and 73% in two separate experiments). Thus endogenous adenosine affected the insulin action via GTP-binding protein-linked A1 receptors on the cells. We next examined whether PGE2, which also activates the GTP-binding protein in the cells, induced any effect on the insulin action. Fig.4 is a typical result showing that PGE2 potentiated the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation. PGE2 at its concentration of 1 μm potentiated the action of 0.1 μm insulin by 3.6 ± 1.5-fold (results from six separate experiments). In these experiments, adenosine deaminase was included in the suspension to eliminate the action of endogenous adenosine. PGE2 showed little effect without the addition of adenosine deaminase (data not shown) as was the case of PIA (see Fig. 3). The effect of PGE2 on the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation could be observed when the action of endogenous adenosine was blocked by PAPA-XAC or 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (data not shown, but see Fig. 5 for PAPA-XAC). We reported that the accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in U937 cells was inhibited by treatment of the cells with a high concentration of dibutyryl cAMP (21Ahmed M.U. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Katada T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23816-23822Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein in rat adipocytes suppresses adenylyl cyclase of the cells, the effects of adenosine and PGE2 might be explained by the decreased adenylyl cyclase activity. We therefore examined whether direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase enhances the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, the effect of endogenous adenosine was prevented by the addition of 5 μm PAPA-XAC, an inhibitor of adenosine A1 receptors. The treatment effectively augmented the isoproterenol-induced accumulation of cAMP (Fig. 5 A), in agreement with a previous finding showing that adenosine deaminase potentiates the cAMP production of rat adipocytes by inactivating endogenous adenosine. Under these conditions, PGE2 attenuated the cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). DDA, which directly inhibits adenylyl cyclase without activating GTP-binding protein, also inhibited the cAMP production (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, PAPA-XAC attenuated the insulin-induced accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as adenosine deaminase did. In contrast, direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by DDA did not affect the accumulation of the lipid product even at high concentrations. One possible explanation for the failure of DDA to increase the insulin-induced [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3accumulation is that the compound possesses dual actions; DDA has an ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase but the compound also inhibits the putative cAMP-dependent mechanism leading to the increased lipid production. This might not be the case because DDA did not affect the augmented accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 observed in the presence of both insulin and PGE2 (data not shown). Insulin is known to activate rapidly a serine/threonine kinase PKB in rat adipocytes (22Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Rahn T. Resjo S. Castan I. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21520-21526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Because the activity of PKB is increased directly (15Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar) or indirectly (16Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by lipid products of PI 3-kinase, it is intriguing to examine whether GTP-binding protein-mediated enhancement of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production is accompanied by enhanced activation of PKB. In the experiments in Table I, cell lysate was incubated with anti-PKBα antibody and the immune complex was subjected to kinase assay with histone H2B as substrate. In agreement with a previous report (22Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Rahn T. Resjo S. Castan I. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21520-21526Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), insulin caused a marked activation of PKB. This activation of PKB was completely blocked by treatment of rat adipocytes with 0.3 μm wortmannin. Incubation of the cells with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase attenuated the insulin-induced activation of PKB, suggesting that endogenous adenosine potentiated the insulin-induced activation of PKB. In agreement with this expectation, a further addition of 0.1 μm PIA to the incubation medium reversed the PKB activity to the level of insulin alone. PGE2 also increased the PKB activity in the presence of both insulin and adenosine deaminase (data not shown, but see below).Table IInhibition by adenosine deaminase of the insulin-induced PKB activationTreatmentPKB activitypmol of Pi transfer/10 minNone0.13 ± 0.01Insulin4.47 ± 0.36Insulin + adenosine deaminase2.21 ± 0.17Insulin + adenosine deaminase + PIA3.60 ± 0.40Isolated adipocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with or without 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase, and then for 5 min with or without 1 μm PIA.

The results are shown as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. Inhibition of adenosine A1 receptors by PAPA-XAC attenuated the insulin-induced activation of PKB (TableII). Under the conditions, PGE2 increased the PKB activity to the level without PAPA-XAC. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by DDA had no effect on the PKB activity. The results suggested again that activators of pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins acted as a positive regulator of insulin actions by a mechanism independent of their inhibitory action on adenylyl cyclase.Table IIFailure of adenylate cyclase inhibition to potentiate the insulin-induced PKB activationTreatmentPKB activitypmol of Pi transfer/10 minNone0.16 ± 0.10Insulin3.94 ± 0.34Insulin + PAPA-XAC2.57 ± 0.47Insulin + PAPA-XAC + PGE23.59 ± 0.37Insulin + PAPA-XAC + DDA2.48 ± 0.48Isolated adipocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min with or without 5 μm PAPA-XAC, and then for 5 min with no addition or with 1 μm PGE2 or 0.1 mmDDA.

Cell lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PKBα antibody, and the immune complex was assayed for kinase activity with histone H2B as substrate. The results are shown as mean ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. In the present study, we showed that activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein enhanced the insulin-induced incorporation of radioactivity to the fraction of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in 32Pi-labeled rat adipocytes. The increased incorporation is considered to accompany the increased intracellular concentration of the second messenger because insulin-induced activation of PKB, the activity of which is under the control of the lipid product of PI 3-kinase, was also enhanced by activation of the GTP-binding protein. Thus, the receptors coupling to the GTP-binding protein were found to positively regulate insulin-signaling systems by affecting the production of the second messenger of insulin. It is reported that adenosine modulates the insulin action for glucose transport in adipocytes (2Joost H.G. Steinfelder H.-J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 22: 614-618PubMed Google Scholar, 3Green A. Newsholme E.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Adenosine exerts this effect through the adenosine A1 receptor coupling to a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein. Although the GTP-binding protein is a negative regulator of adenylyl cyclase, the adenosine effect on the insulin action has been regarded as mostly independent of the change in the adenylyl cyclase activity (6Kuroda M. Honnor R.C. Cushman S.W. Londos C. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Honnor R.C. Naghshineh S. Cushman S.W. Wolff J. Londos C. Simpson I.A. Cell. Signalling. 1992; 4: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we showed that adenosine has an ability to enhance the insulin-signaling cascade mediated by PI 3-kinase. This effect of adenosine was through the GTP-binding protein but was not due to the decreased production of cAMP, because the direct inhibition of adenylyl cyclase did not affect the insulin actions on PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PKB. Thus the enhanced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is another cAMP-independent effect of adenosine. Recent studies demonstrated that PI 3-kinase is enough to stimulate the translocation of glucose transporter from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane (13Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J.

Constitutively activated mutants of PKB is shown to cause the transporter translocation (17Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M. Th. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5315-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 18Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Thus it is intriguing to discuss a possible effect of the enhanced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation on the cellular glucose transport activity. Fig. 6 shows a correlation between a [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content and a rate of glucose uptake in insulin-treated rat adipocytes. The open symbols represent the results obtained when the cells were treated with the various concentrations of insulin alone. The results from the cells treated with the submaximal concentrations (0.01–0.3 μm) of wortmannin and 0.1 μm insulin were shown by the closed symbols. The correlation indicates that the rate of glucose uptake is saturated by a small change in the [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 content. Because of this saturation characteristic, an enhanced accumulation of the second messenger is expected to cause the increased glucose uptake only when the cells are stimulated by submaximal concentrations of insulin. Previous studies in literature indicated that adenosine increases both insulin sensitivity and maximal response to insulin for glucose transport. One report showed that adenosine increases the glucose uptake in response to a maximal concentration of insulin without changing the extent of the translocation (6Kuroda M. Honnor R.C. Cushman S.W. Londos C. Simpson I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 245-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the augmented production of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is not considered to explain the effect of adenosine on the maximal glucose uptake but may contribute in some degree to the increased insulin sensitivity for glucose uptake. The mechanism by which activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein enhances the insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 accumulation is not clear from the present study. The form of PI 3-kinase responsible for the insulin-induced activation is a heterodimer consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. Stimulation of insulin receptors activates tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors leading to a tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which in turn stimulates the catalytic activity of the PI 3-kinase by binding to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains in the regulatory subunit (8Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Thus the GTP-binding proteins might act by increasing the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. In repeated experiments, however, we could not observe any stimulatory effect of adenosine on the insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (data not shown). Another possible mechanism is that adenosine increases the efficiency of binding between PI 3-kinase and IRS-1. We determined repeatedly the PI 3-kinase activity in the anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitate and observed that adenosine never increased but on the contrary decreased the activity slightly but reproducibly (data not shown). The reason is not clear now but PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 has been reported to interact with SH2 domains of PI 3-kinase and to modulate the association between the domains and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (23Rameh L.E. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus adenosine is suggested to decrease the interaction between p85 and IRS-1 by increasing the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production of cells. We have reported that one of the PI 3-kinase activities in a cytosolic fraction of THP-1 cells is stimulated by both a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide derived from IRS-1 and the βγ subunits of GTP-binding proteins in a synergistic manner (24Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. Katada T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also reported that a heterodimer consisting of the β-subtype of p110 and p85 was activated by both of these regulators (25Kurosu H. Maehama T. Okada T. Yamamoto T. Hoshino S. Fukui Y. Ui M. Hazeki O. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24252-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus the present observation suggests that such a dual regulation of the lipid kinase is operating in rat adipocytes. In this regard, we have observed that the PI 3-kinase activity in the anti-p85 immunoprecipitate from these cells is increased by the addition of the βγ subunits (data not shown). If adenosine augmented the insulin-induced PtdIns(3,4,5)P3production by this mechanism, it is interesting to examine whether a similar interaction could be observed for PDGF which activates PI 3-kinase by recruiting the enzyme to membrane receptors (instead of inducing the association with cytosolic protein IRS-1). In order to address this point, we examined the effect of PDGF on rat adipocytes, because stimulation of PDGF receptors on the cells is reported to increase the PI 3-kinase activity associated with an antibody against the receptors even when the cells have not been transfected with the receptors (26Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J. Klinghoffer R. Kazlauskas A. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect any effect of PDGF on the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 production and the PKB activation regardless of whether adenosine deaminase is included in the assay mixture (data not shown). Thus further study using other cell systems is necessary and is now under study in our laboratory to clarify if the interaction could be observed for the agonists other than insulin. In summary, the present paper showed that a second messenger production by insulin is positively regulated by the receptors coupling to GTP-binding protein in physiological target cells of insulin. Although the precise molecular mechanism of this cross-talk is not clear now, the finding is intriguing in view of the central role of PI 3-kinase in insulin-signaling cascades leading to metabolic and mitogenic cellular responses. One possible consequence of the cross-talk is a modified insulin sensitivity for glucose transport as discussed above. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the abnormal function of adenosine A1 receptors in genetically obese animals and the decreased level of Gi in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat have been reported (27LaNoue K.F. Martin L.F. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Gawler D. Milligan G. Spiegel A.M. Unson C.G. Houslay M.D. Nature. 1987; 327: 224-232Google Scholar). Furthermore, a study using transgenic mice has demonstrated that a deficiency of Gαi2 produces impaired glucose tolerance and resistance to insulin (29Moxaham C.M. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 840-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A possible relation of the present study to these observations is intriguing to be examined."
https://openalex.org/W2023705946,"While it is well known that MNU induces thymic lymphomas in the mouse, it remains unclear which pre-mutagenic lesions are responsible for lymphomagenic transformation. One lesion thought to play a critical role is O6methylguanine [O6mG] which initiates G : C to A : T transition mutations in K-ras and other oncogenes. O6alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), encoded by the methylguanine methyltransferase gene [MGMT], removes the methyl group thereby preventing the mutation from occurring. When overexpressed in the thymus, MGMT protects mice from MNU-induced thymic lymphomas. To determine whether MGMT overexpression reduced G : C to A : T mutation frequency after MNU, Big BlueTM lacI and MGMT+/Big BlueTM mice were treated with MNU and analysed for mutations in the lacI and K-ras genes. The incidence of MNU-induced lymphomas was 84% in Big BlueTM lacI mice compared to 14% in MGMT+Big BlueTM lacI mice. Sixty-two per cent of the lymphomas had a GGT to GAT activating mutation in codon 12 of K-ras consistent with O6mG adduct-mediated point mutagenesis. LacI mutation frequency in thymus of MNU treated Big BlueTM mice was 45-fold above background whereas it was 11-fold above background in MNU treated MGMT+/Big BlueTM mice. Most lacI mutations were G : C to A : T transitions, implicating O6mG even in the MGMT+ mice. No mutations were attributable to chromosomal aberrations or rearrangements. Thus, O6mG adducts account for the carcinogenic effect of MNU and MGMT overexpression is selectively able to reduce O6methylguanine adducts below a carcinogenic threshold. Other adducts are mutagenic but appear to contribute much less to malignant transformation or oncogene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2035990925,"The tumour suppressor gene p53 plays a major role in the cellular response to DNA damage, mediating growth arrest and/or apoptosis. Phosphorylation of the protein occurs at numerous sites in vivo and is likely to be a major mechanism for modulation of its activity as a transcriptional transactivator. Not surprisingly, therefore, p53 has been intensively studied by 32P metabolic labelling. Here we show however, using normal human fibroblasts, that typical labelling conditions induce (i) a p53-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis and (ii) an increase in the cellular content of p53 protein detectable by the phosphorylation-sensitive antibody DO-1 but not by antibody DO-12. These data demonstrate for the first time that 32P labelling is sufficient to induce a biologically-significant, p53-mediated cellular response and strongly suggest that it perturbs the phosphorylation state of p53 which it is being used to measure. This highlights the need to re-evaluate earlier data by non-radioactive approaches using phospho-specific antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2012843735,"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is covalently modified by NAD in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) and dithiothreitol. Replacement of NAD with NADH in the presence of SIN-1 (3-morpholinosydnonimine) and dithiothreitol increased modification 25-fold. We now demonstrate that in contrast to NO-mediated attachment of NAD, covalent attachment of NADH to GAPDH proceeds in the presence of low molecular weight thiols, independent of NO. Removal of oxygen and transition metal ions inhibited modification, consistent with a role for reactive oxygen species; inhibition by superoxide dismutase, stimulation by xanthine oxidase/hypoxanthine, and the lack of an effect of catalase supported the hypothesis that superoxide, generated from thiol oxidation, was involved. Electrospray mass spectrometry showed covalent linkage of the NADH molecule to GAPDH. Characterization of the product of phosphodiesterase cleavage demonstrated that linkage to GAPDH occurred through the nicotinamide of NADH. Lys-C digestion of GAPDH, followed by peptide isolation by high performance liquid chromatography, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis, and Edman sequencing, demonstrated that NADH attachment occurred at Cys-149, the active-site thiol. This thiol linkage was stable to HgCl2. Thus, linkage of GAPDH to NADH, in contrast to NAD, occurs in the presence of thiol, is independent of NO, and is mediated by superoxide."
