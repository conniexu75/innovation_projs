https://openalex.org/W2082833890,"By means of in vivo selection, transcriptomic analysis, functional verification and clinical validation, here we identify a set of genes that marks and mediates breast cancer metastasis to the lungs. Some of these genes serve dual functions, providing growth advantages both in the primary tumour and in the lung microenvironment. Others contribute to aggressive growth selectively in the lung. Many encode extracellular proteins and are of previously unknown relevance to cancer metastasis. Much research in breast cancer is aimed at identifying tumour subtypes that influence clinical outcome. One such study has identified a series of genes that mediate breast carcinoma metastasis to the lung but not other organs. Poor-prognosis patients with this gene signature fare much worse than other poor-prognosis patients. The data suggest that a subset of these genes mediates growth of the primary breast tumours and of the metastases in the lung, while a second subset provides virulence at the metastatic site without enhancing primary tumour growth. These genes are potential targets for administered inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2135705792,"Rivers are generally supersaturated with respect to carbon dioxide, resulting in large gas evasion fluxes that can be a significant component of regional net carbon budgets. Amazonian rivers were recently shown to outgas more than ten times the amount of carbon exported to the ocean in the form of total organic carbon or dissolved inorganic carbon. High carbon dioxide concentrations in rivers originate largely from in situ respiration of organic carbon, but little agreement exists about the sources or turnover times of this carbon. Here we present results of an extensive survey of the carbon isotope composition (13C and 14C) of dissolved inorganic carbon and three size-fractions of organic carbon across the Amazonian river system. We find that respiration of contemporary organic matter (less than five years old) originating on land and near rivers is the dominant source of excess carbon dioxide that drives outgassing in medium to large rivers, although we find that bulk organic carbon fractions transported by these rivers range from tens to thousands of years in age. We therefore suggest that a small, rapidly cycling pool of organic carbon is responsible for the large carbon fluxes from land to water to atmosphere in the humid tropics."
https://openalex.org/W1968513003,"Mammalian cells respond to nutrient deprivation by inhibiting energy consuming processes, such as proliferation and protein synthesis, and by stimulating catabolic processes, such as autophagy. p70 S6 kinase (S6K1) plays a central role during nutritional regulation of translation. S6K1 is activated by growth factors such as insulin, and by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is itself regulated by amino acids. The Class IA phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase plays a well recognized role in the regulation of S6K1. We now present evidence that the Class III PI 3-kinase, hVps34, also regulates S6K1, and is a critical component of the nutrient sensing apparatus. Overexpression of hVps34 or the associated hVps15 kinase activates S6K1, and insulin stimulation of S6K1 is blocked by microinjection of inhibitory anti-hVps34 antibodies, overexpression of a FYVE domain construct that sequesters the hVps34 product PI(3)P, or small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of hVps34. hVps34 is not part of the insulin input to S6K1, as it is not stimulated by insulin, and inhibition of hVps34 has no effect on phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2 in insulin-stimulated cells. However, hVps34 is inhibited by amino acid or glucose starvation, suggesting that it lies on the nutrient-regulated pathway to S6K1. Consistent with this, hVps34 is also inhibited by activation of the AMP-activated kinase, which inhibits mTOR/S6K1 in glucose-starved cells. hVps34 appears to lie upstream of mTOR, as small interfering RNA knock-down of hVps34 inhibits the phosphorylation of another mTOR substrate, eIF4E-binding protein-1 (4EBP1). Our data suggest that hVps34 is a nutrient-regulated lipid kinase that integrates amino acid and glucose inputs to mTOR and S6K1.

Thomas G. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Regulation of S6K1 by insulin and nutrients involves a complex pathway that includes mTOR as well as the p85/p110 PI 3-kinases and the downstream kinases PDK-1 and Akt. Phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 is regulated by mTOR, which either directly phosphorylates S6K1 or inhibits its dephosphorylation (2Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 3Long X. Muller F. Avruch J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 115-138PubMed Google Scholar). Thr389 is present in a C-terminal hydrophobic motif, and its phosphorylation facilitates docking of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of the S6K1 activation loop (4Leslie N.R. Biondi R.M. Alessi D.R. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2365-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). mTOR activity is regulated by at least three upstream inputs: amino acids, glucose, and growth factors. Amino acids, particularly leucine, regulate the formation of a nutrient sensing complex with Raptor and GβL/LST8 (referred to as TORC1) that facilitates the recognition of substrates by mTOR under nutrient-replete conditions (5Kim D.H.

Whereas both amino acids and Rheb activation are required for mTOR signaling to S6K1, the role played by TSC1/TSC2 during amino acid regulation of mTOR has been controversial (15Jaeschke A.

Unlike the Class I PI 3-kinase, the Class III PI 3-kinase hVps34 has not been previously implicated in regulation of S6K1 by nutrients. Vps34p was first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Emr and colleagues (25Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6742-6754Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 26Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), who characterized its role in vesicular trafficking. The activity of Vps34p requires the presence of an associated protein kinase, Vps15p (26Stack J.H. Herman P.K. Schu P.V. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2195-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue hVps34 has been shown to play a role in multiple vesicular trafficking pathways (27Siddhanta U.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), which is stimulated in response to nutritional deprivation. Mammalian Vps34 has also been implicated in autophagy (35Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F.C. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Although these data suggest that hVps34 is involved in nutrient-regulated pathways, the possibility that hVps34 itself might be regulated by the cellular nutritional state has not been addressed. In the present study, we have examined the function and regulation of hVps34 in nutrient sensing in mammalian cells. Based on our previous finding that inhibition of hVps34 blocks insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we tested whether hVps34 might play a role in insulin activation of S6K1, which is required for the G1-S transition in insulin-stimulated cells (41Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We now report that hVps34 is required for insulin stimulation of S6K1. hVps34 is not regulated by insulin, nor does it affect insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt or TSC2. However, hVps34 is inhibited by amino acid or glucose starvation, and by activation of AMPK. These data suggest a novel role for hVps34 in nutrient sensing, and in the integration of signaling from amino acids and glucose to mTOR and S6K1. Cell Culture—HepG2 cells and the insulin responsive Chinese hamster ovary-derived cell line GRC+LR-73 were cultured as previously described (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 42Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells expressing beclin 1 from a tetracycline-repressible promoter (43Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Beth Levine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX. Antibodies and Inhibitors—Anti-hVps34 antibodies have been previously described (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) and anti-phosphoribosomal S6 (Ser235) antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phospho-S6K1 (Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424) and anti-phospho-TSC2 (Ser939) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rapamycin, oligomycin, and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-riboside were purchased from CalBiochem (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—Myc-hVps34 has been previously described (33Murray J.T. Panaretou C. Stenmark H. Miaczynska M. Backer J.M. Traffic. 2002; 3: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Akt was obtained from Dr. B. F. Hansen, Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). The eGFP-2X-FYVE construct was obtained from Dr. H. Stenmark, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Norway. HA-tagged p70 S6 kinase was obtained from Dr. S. Schreiber, Harvard University. Constructs were introduced into HEK293T cells using calcium phosphate transfection. Alternatively, plasmids were introduced into GRC+LR-73 cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). hVps34 siRNA Experiments—Cells were transfected with the following RNA duplexes: ACUCAACACUGGCUAAUUAUU and UAAUUAGCCAGUGUUGAGUUU; AUAGAUAGCUCCCAAAUUAUU and UAAUUUGGGAGCUAUCUAUUU; GAACAACGGUUUCGCUCUUUU and AAGAGCGAAACCGUUGUUCUU; GGAGGCAAAUAUCCAGUUAUU and UAACUGGAUAUUUGCCUCCUU. Control duplexes were derived from the sequence of luciferase. Cells were harvested after 3 days, and lysates were immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-hVps34 antibodies. Parallel samples were blotted with anti-Akt, S6K1, phospho-Akt, phospho-S6K1, and phospho-TSC2 antibodies as indicated. hVps34 Activity Assay—Endogenous hVps34 was immunoprecipitated with anti-hVps34 antibodies. Washed immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 10 μm of the peptide used to raise the antibody (AVVEQIHKFAQYWRK). This incubation releases hVps34 from the antibody, which is inhibitory, and allows its activity to be measured in vitro as previously described (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the specific activity of hVps34 measured under these conditions was identical to that of myc-hVps34 immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibodies, which are not inhibitory. Alternatively, beclin 1-associated hVps34 activity was measured directly in washed immunoprecipitates of FLAG-tagged beclin 1. In Vitro p70 S6 Kinase Assay—HEK293T or GRC+LR-73 cells were transfected with HA-S6K1 alone or with myc-hVps34, eGFP, or eGFP-2X-FYVE as indicated. Quiescent cells were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin as indicated, and anti-HA immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity using S6 kinase substrate peptide KRRRLASLAA as described (44Flotow H. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3074-3078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection—GRC+LR-73 cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips. Quiescent cells were microinjected as previously described (27Siddhanta U. McIlroy J. Shah A. Zhang Y.T. Backer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1647-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using antibodies mixed with Oregon Green dextran conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml antibody in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were allowed to recover for 2 h, then incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μm insulin for 30 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and blocked with Renaissance blocking reagent (PerkinElmer Life Science). Cells were stained with sheep anti-pSer235-S6 antibody followed by Cy3 anti-sheep antibody, or with mouse anti-pSer473-Akt (Ser473) followed by Cy3 anti-mouse antibodies. Imaging and Fluorescence Quantitation—Images were collected on a Nikon Eclipse 400 upright microscope using either 60 × 1.4 NA or 100 × 1.25 NA oil emersion objectives and a Roper Cool-Snap cooled CCD camera. Fluorescent images of individual microinjected cells (30–50 cells per condition) were traced, and the total fluorescence intensity was measured using NIH Image. Data were expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence observed in insulin-stimulated control cells. To investigate the potential role of hVps34 in nutrient sensing, we tested whether overexpression of hVps34 could activate S6K1. In HEK293T cells, overexpression of myc-hVps34 lead to a 2-fold increase in HA-S6K1 activity, similar to what was seen in control cells stimulated with insulin (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, overexpression of either hVps34 or the associated hVps15 protein kinase in the insulin-responsive Chinese hamster ovary line GRC+LR-73 (42Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) lead to an increase in phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389 (Fig. 1B), which correlates with S6K1 activation (45Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). These data show that increased expression of hVps34 or hVps15 activates S6K1. To determine whether hVps34 is required for regulation of S6K1 by insulin, we measured S6K1 activity in insulin-stimulated cells overexpressing an eGFP-2XFYVE construct. Low-level expression of this construct is useful as a marker for PI(3)P-containing membranes (46Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). However, we found that high level expression of the 2X-FYVE domain leads to sequestration of PI(3)P and disruption of PI(3)P-dependent signaling, as indicated by the loss of EEA1 endosomal targeting (Fig. 1C). Similarly, expression of eGFP-2XFYVE, but not eGFP, caused a significant reduction in insulin stimulation of HA-S6K1 (Fig. 1D). Basal HA-S6K1 activity was not affected. These data suggest that the hVps34 product, PI(3)P, is required for activation of S6K1 by insulin. To directly address the requirement for hVps34 during insulin activation of S6K1, we used previously described antibodies that specifically inhibit hVps34 activity in microinjected cells; these antibodies have been used to characterize hVps34-dependent signaling in a number of systems (27Siddhanta U.

S6K1 activation was analyzed by immunofluorescence in GRC+LR-73 cells, using anti-pSer235-S6 antibodies to detect S6K1 phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 subunit (Fig. 1E). GRC+LR-73 cells were microinjected with control IgG or anti-hVps34 antibody, incubated in the absence or presence of 1 μm insulin for 30 min, and then fixed and stained. Quantitative imaging of anti-phospho-S6 staining showed that insulin activation of S6K1 was blocked in cells injected with anti-hVps34 antibodies, but not in cells injected with control IgG (Fig. 1F). We also used siRNA to reduce hVps34 expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 1G). Transfection of HeLa cells with siRNA targeting hVps34, but not control siRNA, lead to an almost complete loss of hVps34 expression. Whereas total S6K1 expression was minimally affected, hVps34 siRNA-treated cells showed a marked decrease in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389. Similar results were obtained with a second siRNA duplex (data not shown). Finally, to determine whether hVps34 is required for insulin activation of S6K1 in a more physiological cell type, we co-transfected the insulin-responsive hepatoma line HepG2 with S6K1 plus eGFP or the eGFP-2XFYVE construct. Insulin caused a 2-fold stimulation of S6K1 activity in HepG2 cells expressing eGFP, which was abolished in cells expressing the 2X-FYVE construct (Fig. 1H). S6K1 expression was unaffected (data not shown). Overall, these data show that both hVps34 and its product, PI(3)P, are required for insulin-stimulated activation of S6K1. The insulin- and amino acid-regulated inputs to S6K1 may be distinct. To determine the mechanism by which hVps34 signals to S6K1, we first measured hVps34 activity in insulin-stimulated cells. We were unable to detect significant increases in endogenous hVps34 activity after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2A). We next examined the requirement for hVps34 during insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, which is the major regulator of TSC1/TSC2 in insulin-stimulated cells (12Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 13Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem.

Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PI(3)P can be converted to PI(3,4,5)P3 by the action of Class I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (47Zhang X.L. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J.

This pathway could provide a plausible mechanism for the role of hVps34 during regulation of S6K1, as it could lead to production of PI(3,4,5)P3, activation of Akt, and inhibition of TSC1/TSC2. However, when GRC+LR-73 cells were microinjected with control IgG or inhibitory anti-hVps34 antibody, we observed no effects on insulin-stimulated Akt activation, as measured by immunofluorescence staining with anti-pSer473-AKT antibodies. (Fig. 2B). Similarly, insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 was unaffected by siRNA knock-down of hVps34 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2C). Finally, we looked directly at insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of TSC2 at Ser939; siRNA knock-down of hVps34 had no effect on phosphorylation of TSC2, using two distinct siRNA duplexes (Fig. 2, D and E). Thus, the effect of hVps34 inhibition on S6K1 is independent of the Akt/TSC2 pathway. S6K1 is also regulated by amino acids, which are required for the activity of mTOR (1Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 2Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether hVps34 was involved in the amino acid-dependent input to S6K1. Insulin-stimulated HA-S6K1 activity and endogenous hVps34 activity were both inhibited in HEK293T cells deprived of amino acids (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained in GRC+LR-73 cells (Fig. 3B), where inhibition of hVps34 by amino acid starvation was maximal by 30 min. This decrease occurred without any change in the abundance of hVps34 protein (inset). In yeast and mammalian cells, hVps34 forms complexes with the autophagy-related protein Apg6p/beclin 1 (34Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 38Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and a previous report suggested that beclin 1-associated hVps34 is transiently activated during the induction of autophagy by withdrawal of amino acids (49Tassa A. Roux M.P. Attaix D. Bechet D.M. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To study the regulation of beclin 1-associated hVps34 in an established autophagy-competent cell line, we measured hVps34 activity in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from MCF-7 cells expressing an inducible FLAG-tagged beclin 1 (43Liang X.H. Yu J. Brown K. Levine B. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3443-3449PubMed Google Scholar). We found that beclin 1-associated hVps34 activity was inhibited by amino acid deprivation (Fig. 3C); the amount of beclin-associated hVps34 did not change appreciably (inset). mTOR activation of S6K1 is blocked by both amino acid and glucose starvation (5Kim D.H.

This latter regulation may be due at least in part to AMPK, which is activated by glucose deprivation in mammalian cells and yeast (9Carling D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 18-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), and which inhibits mTOR/S6K1 through an activating phosphorylation of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, or via an inhibitory phosphorylation of mTOR (10Cheng S.W.

Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar). To determine whether hVps34 is also regulated by glucose, we measured hVps34 activity in cells deprived of glucose, amino acids, or both. Inhibition of hVps34 by glucose starvation was similar to that seen during amino acid starvation (Fig. 4A); removal of both nutrients did not cause additional inhibition of hVps34. To examine the potential role of AMPK in this inhibition, GRC+LR-73 cells were treated for 30 min with the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-riboside. hVps34 activity was significantly inhibited in 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-riboside-treated cells, suggesting that hVps34 is negatively regulated by the AMPK-mediated response to nutrient deprivation (Fig. 4B). Similar results were observed after treatment of cells with oligomycin, which also activates AMPK (Fig. 4C). AMPK-mediated inhibition of hVps34 is independent of effects on mTOR, because hVps34 activity is unaffected by treatment of cells with rapamycin, which inhibi"

https://openalex.org/W1978941497,"Changing the interactions between particles in an ensemble--by varying the temperature or pressure, for example--can lead to phase transitions whose critical behaviour depends on the collective nature of the many-body system. Despite the diversity of ingredients, which include atoms, molecules, electrons and their spins, the collective behaviour can be grouped into several families (called 'universality classes') represented by canonical spin models. One kind of transition, the Mott transition, occurs when the repulsive Coulomb interaction between electrons is increased, causing wave-like electrons to behave as particles. In two dimensions, the attractive behaviour responsible for the superconductivity in high-transition temperature copper oxide and organic compounds appears near the Mott transition, but the universality class to which two-dimensional, repulsive electronic systems belongs remains unknown. Here we present an observation of the critical phenomena at the pressure-induced Mott transition in a quasi-two-dimensional organic conductor using conductance measurements as a probe. We find that the Mott transition in two dimensions is not consistent with known universality classes, as the observed collective behaviour has previously not been seen. This peculiarity must be involved in any emergent behaviour near the Mott transition in two dimensions."

Previous studies revealed that lipin plays a critical role in adipogenesis, explaining the adipose-deficient phenotype of the fld mouse. In the current study, we demonstrate that alternative mRNA splicing generates two lipin isoforms, lipin-α and lipin-β, which are differentially expressed during adipocyte differentiation. Lipin-α expression peaks at day 2 of 3T3-L1 cell differentiation, after which its levels gradually decrease. In contrast, lipin-β expression is transiently elevated at 10 h, followed by a drop to background levels at 20 h and a gradual increase between days 2 and 6 of differentiation. The two lipin isoforms also exhibit differences in subcellular localization. Lipin-α is predominantly nuclear, whereas lipin-β is primarily located in the cytoplasm of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, suggesting distinct cellular functions. Using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing either lipin-α or lipin-β, we demonstrate functional differences between the two isoforms. Whereas lipin-α is required for adipocyte differentiation, the predominant effect of lipin-β expression is the induction of lipogenic genes. In vivo, overexpression of lipin-β specifically in mature adipocytes leads to elevated expression of lipogenic genes and adipocyte hypertrophy, confirming a role of lipin-β in the regulation of lipogenesis. In conclusion, our data suggest that the two lipin isoforms have distinct, but complementary, functions in adipogenesis, with lipin-α playing a primary role in differentiation and lipin-β being predominantly involved in lipogenesis.

Lipodystrophies are a group of disorders characterized by loss of adipose tissue and the ensuing development of metabolic abnormalities of lipid and glucose metabolism (1Garg A. Am. J.

Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Lpin1 mutations in fld mice lead to dramatically reduced body fat, insulin resistance, and increased susceptibility to diet-induced atherosclerosis (3Reue K. Xu P. Wang X-P. Slavin B.G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipin is a novel protein without any known protein domains other than a nuclear localization signal. However, it contains two evolutionarily conserved regions (NLIP and CLIP domains), which identify a novel gene family including two additional members in mammals, Lpin2 and Lpin3, and several orthologous genes in invertebrates, plants, and fungi (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Recent studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed interactions between the NLIP domain and several nuclear proteins (4Tange Y. Hirata A. Niwa O. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4375-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the molecular function of lipin remains to be identified, studies in yeast suggest a role in the maintenance of nuclear envelope structure and nucleocytoplasmic transport. Consistent with the effects of lipin mutations on adipose tissue function, lipin is prominently expressed in adipose tissue (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Lipin is phosphorylated in response to insulin stimulation, which suggests an important role for this protein in adipose tissue (5Huffman T.A. Mothe-Satney I. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, unlike other markers of adipocyte differentiation, lipin exhibits a unique biphasic expression pattern during the conversion of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). First, coincident with the expression patterns of the early adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β and C/EBPδ, lipin expression transiently peaks at 10 h into the differentiation program before returning to a low level by 20 h. In a second wave of expression, lipin expression gradually increases during days 2–6 of differentiation and reaches highest levels in mature adipocytes. Using lipin-deficient cells, we demonstrated that early lipin expression is required prior to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ for adipocyte differentiation to occur (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Using a transgenic mouse model, we have recently shown that lipin overexpression in mature adipocytes leads to increased lipogenic gene expression and fat accumulation (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest distinct roles for lipin in adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis (8Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. Drug News Perspect. 2005; 18: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the current study, we demonstrate that the Lpin1 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, which generates two lipin isoforms, lipin-α and lipin-β. We show that the two isoforms exhibit differences in expression, subcellular localization, and cellular function. Our results suggest that the lipin isoforms have complementary roles in adipogenesis, with lipin-α playing a primary role in differentiation, whereas lipin-β is predominantly involved in the regulation of lipogenesis in mature adipocytes. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Retroviral Infection—3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. Pre-adipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes as described (9Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were transfected by electroporation (10Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L-J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Isolation of primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in vitro differentiation into adipocytes were performed as described (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of lipin-deficient MEFs was performed by retroviral infection with pBABE retroviral vectors containing no insert, or lipin-α or lipin-β inserts (constructs described below) (11Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). To ensure infection of all cells used for analyses, MEFs were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 4 days. Plasmid and Retroviral Constructs—To generate vectors for the expression of lipin with the V5 epitope tag, full-length lipin-α (GenBank™ accession number NM_172950) and lipin-β (NM_015763) cDNAs were PCR-amplified using the primers GGC TAG CCA CCA TGA ATT ACG TGG GGC AGC TGG CC and GGC TAG CGC TGA GGC TGA ATG CAT GTC, and TA-cloned into the pcDNA3.1-V5/His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). To produce retroviral vectors for expression of lipin isoforms, lipin-α and -β cDNAs with 3′-FLAG epitope tag were subcloned into the pBabe retroviral vector, and expression in MEFs was performed as described (11Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Reverse Transcription PCR and RNA Quantitation—Total RNA was isolated with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using Super-Script II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Relative expression of lipin-α and lipin-β in various mouse tissues was determined by PCR amplification of the Rapid-Scan panel of normalized cDNAs (OriGene, Rockville, MD). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).

Samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), electrophoresed in the presence of SDS, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) using a semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the membranes were blocked overnight in 5% dry milk and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma-Aldrich). The ECL+ chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used to visualize immunoreactive protein bands. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured on collagen-coated glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, rinsed, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Cells were then incubated with 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. After rinsing, cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline several times and incubated with 3 μg/ml Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h. After another rinse, cells were incubated with 200 nm SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 15 min, briefly washed to remove excess stain and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Appropriate controls were maintained by substituting the primary antibody with normal mouse IgGs (Sigma-Aldrich) to check for nonspecific binding. Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were processed using the Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA). To quantify the intracellular distribution of lipin, at least 60 and 100 randomly chosen transfected adipocytes and pre-adipocytes, respectively, were evaluated for each lipin isoform. The experiment was repeated at least three times. Cells were assigned into one of three categories based on staining pattern. Localization was considered cytoplasmic or nuclear, when fluorescence signal was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively, and mixed, when both compartments were significantly stained. Fig. 3b shows quantification of the cytoplasmic staining category. Adipocyte and Adipose Tissue Measurements—Six days after the initiation of differentiation, MEFs were stained with Oil Red O to visualize accumulated lipid. Triglyceride content was determined using the GPO-Trinder (Sigma-Aldrich) or L-Type TG H (Wako Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA) kits. Protein content was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Mice and Adipose Tissue—The aP2-lipin transgenic mouse strain has been described previously (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To generate these mice, lipin-β cDNA was cloned downstream of the 5.4-kb adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2) promoter/enhancer (12Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and upstream of an SV40 intron/poly(A) sequence (13Liu X. Rossmeisl M. McClaine J. Riachi M. Harper M.E. Kozak L.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 399-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The aP2-lipin-β construct was injected into C57BL/6J oocytes and a line of mice expressing 2–3-fold elevated lipin mRNA in adipose tissue was established (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For experiments, transgenic mice were compared with age- and sex-matched non-transgenic C57BL/6J littermate controls. Epididymal adipose tissue samples were harvested from male aP2-lipin transgenic and non-transgenic littermates after 6 weeks on a high fat diet (35% fat and 33% carbohydrate; Diet F3282, Bio-Serve, Frenchtown, NJ). Adipose tissue was fixed in formalin, sectioned at 8 μm, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Sections were examined by light microscopy and photographed at a final magnification of ×320. Adipose tissue triglyceride content was determined as described above. Adipose tissue cellularity was determined by fluorometric DNA quantitation using Hoechst dye 33258 from pre-weighed gonadal adipose tissue depots (14Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4550) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—The number of replicates for each study is indicated in the figure legends. Values are represented as means ± S.E. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used to calculate p values. Alternative Splicing of Lpin1—Our initial studies on lipin indicated the presence of Lpin1 mRNAs of different sizes (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To identify the source of this heterogeneity, we surveyed EST sequences belonging to the Lpin1 UniGene cluster (Mm.153625). This analysis revealed that several mRNA variants are produced from this gene (Fig. 1a). Alignments with genomic sequences indicated alternative polyadenylation sites (data not shown) and the presence of several alternatively utilized exons flanked by consensus splicing motifs (Fig. 1b). Three types of Lpin1 mRNAs could be distinguished based on the distinct combinations of 5′-untranslated exons: 1A-3, 1B-2–3, and 1B-3 (Fig. 1a). The mutually exclusive utilization of exons 1A and 1B, and the absence of upstream splice acceptor signature sequences suggest that exons 1A and 1B are alternative first exons of the Lpin1 gene, most likely driven by alternative promoters. In addition to the non-coding exons 1A and 1B, we also recognized an alternative exon (exon 7) in the coding region, which adds 99 nucleotides to the Lpin1 mRNA (Fig. 1, a and d). The abundance of Lpin1 splice variants suggests complex post-transcriptional regulation of this gene. To test the potential functional significance of alternative splicing events, we analyzed lipin mRNA species in adipose tissue, one of the primary tissues of lipin expression. We reasoned that functionally important splicing patterns would be recognized as those that change during the conversion of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes. Therefore, we compared Lpin1 splicing in 3T3-F442A cells before and after in vitro differentiation into adipocytes. The 3T3-F442A cell line was chosen for these studies, because, unlike 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, these cells express significant amounts of Lpin1 mRNA even in the undifferentiated state. Using RT-PCR, exon 1A-containing Lpin1 messages could not be detected either before or after differentiation in 3T3-F442A cells, but were present in testis (Fig. 1a) suggesting that the putative distal promoter is inactive in adipose tissue. Transcripts beginning with exon 1B were readily detectable in 3T3-F442A cells and showed an overall increase in abundance during adipocyte differentiation. A similar induction during differentiation was seen regardless of whether exon 2 was also present (compare levels of 1B-2–3 and 1B-3). In contrast, lipin mRNA containing exon 7 showed a dramatic increase in relative abundance during differentiation. Whereas pre-adipocytes expressed similar amounts of mRNAs with and without exon 7, mature adipocytes predominantly expressed the longer splice variant containing exon 7. Analysis of cDNAs obtained from a panel of mouse tissues revealed differential expression of mRNAs with and without exon 7 in tissues such as heart and brain, suggesting that Lpin1 mRNA splicing may be regulated in these tissues as well (Fig. 1c). Thus, of the alternatively spliced exons examined, only exon 7 appears to be differentially utilized in pre-adipocytes compared with mature adipocytes. Importantly, inclusion of the 99-nucleotide-long exon 7 produces an in-frame addition of 33 amino acids in the mature lipin protein, which may have consequences for protein function (Fig. 1d). The subsequent studies described here focus on the functional characterization of these two splice variants (Lpin1α and Lpin1β) and their corresponding protein isoforms (lipin-α and lipin-β). Temporal Changes in Lpin1α/β Splicing during 3T3-L1 Differentiation—To confirm the results obtained in 3T3-F442A cells and to characterize temporal changes in Lpin1α/β splicing in more detail, we analyzed the adipogenic conversion of the 3T3-L1 cell line. Post-confluent cultures of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were stimulated to differentiate with a hormone mixture containing insulin (9Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RT-PCR was performed at various time points afterward. Differentiation was followed by analyzing the expression of adipsin and Pref-1, markers of mature adipocytes and pre-adipocytes, respectively. As expected, adipsin expression was undetectable in pre-adipocytes and gradually increased during differentiation, whereas Pref-1 expression was strongest in pre-adipocytes and decreased during the course of this process (Fig. 2a, lower panels). As demonstrated previously, overall Lpin1 expression increased significantly during adipogenesis (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The most dramatic elevation in expression occurred within the first 2 days of differentiation, after which lipin mRNA levels increased moderately. Consistent with observations in 3T3-F442A cells, expression of the Lpin1α splice variant decreased, whereas that of Lpin1β increased during the differentiation process indicating a gradual shift from α-type to β-type splicing (Fig. 2a, upper panels). In addition to being highly expressed in mature adipocytes, Lpin1 has a transient peak of expression at 10 h into the differentiation program (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine the splicing pattern of early Lpin1 expression, we analyzed RNA samples collected at 10-h intervals during the first 2 days of differentiation. The isoform distribution of Lpin1 in undifferentiated pre-adipocytes (0 h) showed a preponderance of α-type splicing (Fig. 2b). In contrast, Lpin1β was the predominant splice variant present at 10 h, when overall lipin expression peaks (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). At 20 h, expression of Lpin1β dropped dramatically, followed by a gradual increase. To quantify changes in Lpin1 splicing during early differentiation, we performed real-time RT-PCR using primers specific to each of the two splice variants (Fig. 2c). The results indicate that the Lpin1β/Lpin1α ratio increases more than 10-fold between 0 and 10 h, and then decreases by a similar magnitude between 10 and 20 h. In summary, our data demonstrate dramatic shifts in Lpin1 splicing coincident with changes in Lpin1 expression during adipocyte differentiation. Whereas Lpin1α is the principal splice variant in undifferentiated cells, Lpin1β is the predominant isoform during the transient induction at 10 h as well as in mature adipocytes. The distinct expression dynamics and protein sequence differences between lipin-α and lipin-β suggest independent roles in adipocyte biology. Lipin Isoforms Exhibit Different Subcellular Localization—As described earlier, the lipin-α and -β isoforms differ in the absence or presence of a stretch of 33 amino acids. Our previous studies demonstrated that lipin-α is a nuclear protein (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). To test whether the additional amino acid sequence present in lipin-β affects its intracellular distribution, we compared the subcellular localization of exogenous lipin-α and lipin-β using fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with previous results, lipin-α exhibited predominantly nuclear localization in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3a). In contrast, even though lipin-β also contains the nuclear localization signal, this isoform was predominantly cytoplasmic in most cells examined. Quantitative analyses indicated a ∼10-fold difference in the percentage of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic lipin-α versus lipin-β (Fig. 3b). Similar differences were observed in pre-adipocytes, although the magnitude of the difference (∼1.8-fold) was considerably less than in mature adipocytes. These results demonstrate that alternative splicing of exon 7 has a major effect on the subcellular localization of lipin and suggest that the two isoforms may have different cellular functions. Lipin-α and Lipin-β Play Distinct Roles in Adipogenesis—Differences in temporal expression pattern and subcellular localization between lipin-α and lipin-β raised the possibility that the two isoforms may have different functions in adipogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we generated MEFs expressing only one or the other lipin isoform. Lipin-deficient MEFs prepared from fld mouse embryos were infected with retrovirus containing Lpin1α or Lpin1β expression constructs with a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag. To ensure survival of only infected MEFs, cells were selected in antibiotic, and expression levels of lipin-α and lipin-β were demonstrated to be similar by Western blot analysis of the FLAG-tagged lipin (Fig. 4a). After selection for infected cells, MEFs were grown to confluence and induced to differentiate into adipocytes for 6 days. Consistent with our previous results (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), fld MEFs infected with empty vector accumulated negligible amounts of triglyceride due to impaired adipocyte differentiation in the absence of lipin (Fig. 4b). Reconstitution of lipin expression with the lipin-α isoform resulted in a ∼80-fold increase in triglyceride accumulation indicating that lipin-α is required for adipocyte differentiation. Lipin-β had a substantially smaller effect on triglyceride accumulation than lipin-α indicating that the two isoforms are not functionally equivalent. We investigated two possible reasons for the higher triglyceride content in lipin-α compared with lipin-β expressing cells: increased number of cells induced to differentiate and accumulate triglyceride, or increased lipid content per cell. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we stained cultures of differentiated cells with oil red O and examined the distribution of lipid in the cells. We found that a greater proportion of cells stained in lipin-α than lipin-β expressing cultures (Fig. 4c, upper panel). This suggested that lipin-α is more effective at inducing differentiation, thus leading to the observed higher triglyceride content in cultures expressing this lipin isoform. We noticed, however, that the differentiated adipocytes that were present in lipin-β-expressing cultures contained larger lipid droplets than those in lipin-α cultures (Fig. 4c, lower panel). This observation raised the possibility that, in contrast to the involvement of lipin-α in differentiation, lipin-β plays a role in triglyceride accumulation in differentiated adipocytes. To characterize the effects of lipin isoforms on adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression, we determined the relative mRNA levels for several genes involved in these processes by real-time RT-PCR. Lipin-α expression led to highly elevated mRNA levels of the adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα as well as aP2, a marker of mature adipocytes (Fig. 4d). In sharp contrast, lipin-β had no (PPARγ, C/EBPα) or only minor (aP2) effect on the expression of these genes. The analysis of genes involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis revealed a strikingly different pattern of expression. Lipin-β strongly stimulated the expression of mRNAs encoding critical enzymes of fatty acid (acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)), glycerol (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)), and triglyceride (diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)) synthesis. On this set of genes, lipin-α expression had less pronounced effects than lipin-β. mRNA levels of three genes involved in triglyceride droplet structure or lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase, perilipin, and adipocyte differentiation-related protein) were indistinguishable between MEFs expressing lipin-α or lipin-β (data not shown). In summary, these data indicate that the two lipin isoforms exert distinct effects on the expression of adipogenic and lipogenic genes. Overexpression of Lipin-β Leads to Adipocyte Hypertrophy in Vivo—To confirm the role of lipin-β in lipogenesis in vivo, we characterized aP2-lipin-β transgenic (Tg) mice. These mice have enhanced lipin-β expression under the control of aP2 gene regulatory elements, which direct expression specifically in mature adipocytes (12Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This model therefore provides a valuable tool with which to investigate the effect of lipin-β on mature adipocyte functions, such as lipogenesis, without any effect on earlier events in adipocyte differentiation. Adipose tissue from these mice exhibit a 2–3-fold elevation in lipin-β mRNA levels with no alteration in lipin-α mRNA levels (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vitro results presented above, we previously showed that adipose tissue from the lipin-β Tg mice exhibits elevated expression of lipogenic genes such as DGAT, but not adipogenic genes such as PPARγ and C/EBPα (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Examination of gonadal adipose tissue in lipin-β Tg animals revealed that the adipocytes were larger (Fig. 5a) and contained more triglyceride per cell than non-Tg littermates (Fig. 5b). There was no difference in cellularity of the gonadal fat pad (Fig. 5c), which suggests that increased adiposity in the Tg animals is a consequence of elevated lipid accumulation per cell, and not hyperplasia. Thus, our in vitro and in vivo results establish that lipin-β is a positive regulator of lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. Alternative splicing gives rise to multiple Lpin1 mRNA variants. Here, we characterize splice variants, which give rise to two distinct protein isoforms, lipin-α and -β. Lipin-α and -β exhibit distinct expression profiles during adipocyte differentiation. In pre-adipocytes, lipin-α is the predominant mRNA splice variant, whereas lipin-β is the principal splice form in mature adipocytes. The contrasting expression patterns suggest distinct roles for the lipin isoforms in adipocyte biology. To investigate the cellular functions of the two lipin isoforms independently, we took advantage of MEFs harboring a null mutation (fld)in the lipin gene (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Retroviral expression of lipin-α and -β in these cells demonstrates that the two isoforms are functionally non-equivalent. Although both isoforms stimulate overall lipid accumulation, the underlying mechanisms seem to be different. Lipin-α expression dramatically increases the number of cells undergoing differentiation concomitant with elevated levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two critical transcriptional regulators of adipogenesis. This result is consistent with our previous studies showing that lipin-α acts upstream of PPARγ in the adipogenic molecular cascade (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Compared with lipin-α, lipin-β expression allows only a small number of cells to differentiate, and, consequently, its effect on PPARγ and C/EBPα expression was undetectable. However, we unexpectedly found that lipin-β stimulates the expression of lipogenic genes and triggers increased lipid accumulation per cell compared with lipin-α. Our results suggest that lipin-β is directly involved in the regulation of lipogenesis in adipocytes. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed lipin-β specifically in mature adipocytes in aP2-lipin-β transgenic mice (7Phan J. Reue K. Cell Metabolism. 2005; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Using these mice, we demonstrate that adipocytes with elevated levels of lipin-β accumulate more triglyceride. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cellular level of lipin-β is a modulator of lipid accumulation in adipocytes. In summary, our studies suggest distinct, but complementary, functions for lipin-α and lipin-β in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, respectively. We demonstrated previously that lipin exhibits a biphasic expression pattern during adipogenesis with a first wave of expression in the very early stages of differentiation and a second wave in mature adipocytes (6Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29558-29564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 8Phan J. Peterfy M. Reue K. Drug News Perspect. 2005; 18: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Here we show that although lipin-α is expressed throughout the early differentiation period (day 0–2), it is lipin-β that predominates in a transient lipin expression peak at 10 h after induction of differentiation. Because lipin-α is the isoform required for stimulation of the adipogenic transcription factors PPARγ and C/EBPα, the functional significance of early lipin-β expression is presently unknown. The finding that MEFs expressing exclusively lipin-α have no major defects in their capacity to differentiate suggests that early expression of lipin-β may only have a subtle role in adipogenesis, at least in vitro. Also, it is likely that the function of early expressed lipin-β is distinct from its lipogenesis-stimulating role in mature adipocytes. Further studies will be required to elucidate the role of lipin-β during the early stages of adipogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of lipin-α and lipin-β on the expression of genes involved in differentiation and lipogenesis, respectively, are unknown. Lipin has a putative nuclear localization signal and can gain access to the nucleus (2Peterfy M. Phan J. Reue K. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, as it lacks a recognizable DNA binding domain, the effect of lipin on gene expression is likely to be indirect. Consistent with this possibility, a yeast lipin homolog has been shown to interact with a component of the nuclear pore complex (4Tange Y. Hirata A. Niwa O. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4375-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a nuclear structure implicated in the regulation of gene expression in yeast (15Casolari J.M. Brown C.R. Komili S. West J. Hieronymus H. Silver P.A. Cell. 2004; 117: 427-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). As lipin-α is predominantly nuclear, it may be involved in analogous molecular pathways in pre-adipocytes. We unexpectedly found that lipin-β, the dominant isoform in mature adipocytes, resides predominantly in the cytoplasm in these cells. This observation suggests that lipin-β may have a cytoplasmic function. Alternatively, lipin-β may play a nuclear role after regulated translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The latter possibility, however, seems unlikely, as we have been unable to induce nuclear translocation of lipin-β in adipocytes by treatment with a number of serum factors and hormones, including insulin. 3M. Peterfy, unpublished observations. Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a versatile mechanism with the potential to regulate virtually all aspects of protein function (16Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). In line with results shown here, alternative splicing is a common mechanism in the regulation of subcellular distribution of a wide range of gene products (17Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C.

Developmentally regulated alternative splicing is also widespread in diverse tissues and developmental processes (22Schiafino S. Reggiani C. Physiol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 646-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism of splicing pattern changes in Lpin1 mRNA during adipogenesis? A potential candidate for triggering shifts in splicing is insulin signaling. Insulin, an essential hormone for adipocyte differentiation, has been implicated in the modulation of insulin receptor (27Sell S.M. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase Cβ (28Chalfant C.E. Mischak H. Watson J.E. Winkler B.C. Goodnight J. Farese R.V. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13326-13332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) mRNA splicing. Moreover, IGF-I, which activates a signaling cascade similar to that of insulin, regulates splicing of its own message (29Patel N. Chalfant C.E. Watson J.E. Wyatt J.R. Dean N.M. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22648-22654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Likely mechanisms mediating the effect of insulin on splicing include the regulation of SR splicing factors, such as SRp40, at the transcriptional (29Patel N. Chalfant C.E. Watson J.E. Wyatt J.R.

Alternative splicing of the lipin message may involve similar mechanisms. However, lipin-β splicing first increases then decreases in the presence of insulin during early stages of 3T3-L1 differentiation indicating that the regulation of lipin splicing is complex. Ongoing studies in our laboratory are expected to shed light on the underlying mechanisms. We thank Dr. G.

Little is known about the mechanisms of perception of these molecules by plants and about the associated signal transduction pathways that trigger plant immunity. Here we address the issue of the molecular basis of elicitation of plant defenses through the structural determination of the LOS of the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strain 8004 and examination of the effects of LOS and fragments obtained by chemical treatments on the immune response in Arabidopsis thaliana. The structure shows a strong accumulation of negatively charged groups in the lipid A-inner core region and has a number of novel features, including a galacturonyl phosphate attached at a 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid residue and a unique phosphoramide group in the inner core region. Intact LOS and the lipid A and core oligosaccharides derived from it were all able to induce the defense-related genes PR1 and PR2 in Arabidopsis and to prevent the hypersensitive response caused by avirulent bacteria. Although LOS induced defense-related gene transcription in two temporal phases, the core oligosaccharide induced only the earlier phase, and lipid A induced only the later phase. These findings suggest that plant cells can recognize lipid A and core oligosaccharide structures within LOS to trigger defensive cellular responses and that this may occur via two distinct recognition events.

Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 2Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). They are amphiphilic macromolecules composed of a hydrophilic heteropolysaccharide (comprising the core oligosaccharide and O-specific polysaccharide or O-chain) covalently linked to a lipophilic moiety termed lipid A, which anchors these macromolecules to the outer membrane. LPSs not possessing the O-chain are termed rough LPSs or lipooligosaccharides (LOSs). In animal and insect cells, innate immune defenses are triggered by the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), conserved and generally indispensable microbial structures including LPSs. The recognition of PAMPs by these cells is often mediated by leucine-rich repeat proteins such as Toll in Drosophila and the Toll-like receptors in mammals (3Miyake K. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 186-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 4Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev.

Triantafilou K. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 301-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Recognition of LPSs occurs through the lipid A moiety, which is responsible for most of the biological effects of LPS in animals. Lipid A toxicity in animals strongly depends on its structure and is also influenced by the covalently linked core region, which possesses immunogenic properties (1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3222) Google Scholar, 2Alexander C. Rietschel E.T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 167-202PubMed Google Scholar). LPSs apparently have diverse roles in bacterial pathogenesis of plants. As major components of the outer membrane, LPSs are involved in the protection of bacterial cell, contributing to reduce the membrane permeability and thus allowing growth of bacterium in the unfavorable conditions of the plant environment (7Dow J.M. Osbourn A.E. Wilson T.J.G. Daniels M.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe. Interact. 1995; 8: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In contrast, LPSs can be recognized by plants to elicit or potentiate plant defense-related responses as part of a group of general elicitors that include flagellin and periplasmic oligosaccharides (8Conrath U. Thulke O. Katz V. Schwindling S. Kohler A. Eur. J. Plant Pathol. 2001; 107: 113-119Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Zeidler D. Zahringer U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15811-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). One of the most widely studied effects of LPSs on plant cells is their ability to prevent the hypersensitive response (HR) induced in plants by avirulent bacteria. HR is a programmed cell death response, triggered by live bacteria, that is often associated with plant host resistance. In comparison with animal and human cells, little is known about the mechanisms of LPS perception by plants and the cognate signal transduction pathway. Recent findings have suggested that the lipid A moiety may be at least partially responsible for LPS perception by Arabidopsis thaliana, leading to a rapid burst of NO, a hallmark of innate immunity in animals (9Zeidler D. Zahringer U. Gerber I. Dubery I. Hartung T. Bors W. Hutzler P. Durner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15811-15816Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Using synthetic O-antigen polysaccharides (oligorhamnans), it has been shown that the O-chain of LPS is recognized by Arabidopsis and that this recognition leads to elicitation of a specific gene transcription response associated with defense (10Bedini E. De Castro C. Erbs G. Mangoni L. Dow J.M. Newman M.-A. Parrilli M. Unverzagt C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2414-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the established influence of the core region on lipid A toxicity in animals, indicate that the elucidation of the structure and of the biological activity of both lipid A and core region are of high importance for a better understanding of LPS action in plants. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc) is the causative agent of black rot, a disease of cruciferous crops that is of worldwide importance. Xcc can also infect non-crop crucifers, such as the model plant A. thaliana. Both LPS and LOS have been described in Xcc, with LOS being the predominant form in some strains (7Dow J.M. Osbourn A.E. Wilson T.J.G. Daniels M.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe. Interact. 1995; 8: 768-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the molecular basis for the induction by Xcc LOS of defense responses in A. thaliana. Our approach has been to determine the complete structure of purified Xcc LOS and to examine its activity in the prevention of HR caused by avirulent bacteria and the induction of defense-related genes. We show that Xcc LOS is a unique molecule with a high negative charge density and a phosphoramide group, never found before in such molecules. Through comparison of the activity of intact Xcc LOS with chemically obtained (and structurally defined) fragments, we provide evidence that LOS acts to elicit defense responses in A. thaliana via independent recognition of the lipid A and the core oligosaccharide moieties, respectively. Bacterial Growth and LOS Extraction—Strain 8004 of X. campestris pv. campestris was grown in 100 liters of peptone-yeast extract-glycerol medium (NYGB) in a New Brunswick SSR 7 fermenter and harvested as described previously (11Molinaro A. Silipo A. Lanzetta R. Newman M.A. Dow J.M. Parrilli M. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Freeze-dried cells were extracted three times with a mixture of aqueous 90% phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether (2:5:8, v/v/v) (12Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). After removal of the organic solvents under vacuum, the LOS fraction was precipitated from phenol with water, washed first with aqueous 80% phenol and then three times with cold acetone, and lyophilized with a yield of about 4.3% of the dry mass. For detection of LOS, fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% gels, which were stained with silver nitrate. Chemical Degradation of LOS for Structural Analysis—For isolation of OS1 and OS2, LOS (40 mg) was dissolved in tetrahydrofurane and treated with anhydrous hydrazine (2 ml), stirred at 37 °C for 90 min, cooled, poured into ice-cold acetone (20 ml), and allowed to precipitate. The precipitate was then centrifuged (3000 × g, 30 min), washed twice with ice-cold acetone, dried, dissolved in water, and lyophilized (oligosaccharide OS2, 32 mg, 80% of the LOS). An aliquot of OS2 product (20 mg) was de-N-acylated with 4 m KOH as described (13Holst O. Methods in Molecular Biology, Bacterial Toxins: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 345Google Scholar). Salts were removed by gel permeation chromatography with Sephadex G-10 (Amersham Biosciences) column (50 × 1.5 cm) to yield the resulting oligosaccharide OS1 (16 mg, 40% of the LOS). Chemical Degradation of LOS for Plant Tests—Free lipid A was obtained by hydrolysis of the LOS (40 mg) with 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.4, (100 °C, 3 h). The solution was extracted three times with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (100:100:30, v/v/v) and centrifuged (4 °C, 5000 g, 15 min). The organic phase contained the lipid A, and the water phase contained the core oligosaccharide. General Analytical Methods—Determination of sugar residues and of their absolute configuration, GLC, and GLC-MS were all carried out as described (14Leontein K. Lönngren J. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1978; 62: 359-362Google Scholar, 15Molinaro A. De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Evidente A. Parrilli M. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10058-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Monosaccharides were identified as acetylated O-methyl-glycoside derivatives. After methanolysis (2 m HCl/MeOH, 85 °C, 24 h) and acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine (85 °C, 30 min), the sample was analyzed by GLC-MS. Linkage analysis was carried out by methylation of the complete core region as described (16Hakomori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1964; 55: 205-208PubMed Google Scholar). The sample was hydrolyzed with 4 m trifluoroacetic acid (100 °C, 4 h), carbonyl-reduced with NaBD4, carboxyl-methylated, carboxyl-reduced, acetylated, and analyzed by GLC-MS. Total fatty acid content was obtained by acid hydrolysis (17Silipo A. Lanzetta R. Garozzo D. Lo Cantore P. Iacobellis N.S. Molinaro A. Parrilli M. Evidente A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2498-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). LOS was first treated with 4 m HCl (4 h, 100 °C) and then neutralized with NaOH 5 m (30 min, 100 °C). Fatty acids were then extracted in CHCl3, methylated with diazomethane, and analyzed by GLC-MS. The ester-bound fatty acids were selectively released by base-catalyzed hydrolysis with NaOH 0.5 m, MeOH (1:1, v/v, 85 °C, 2 h), and then the product was acidified, extracted in CHCl3, methylated with diazomethane, and analyzed by GLC-MS. The absolute configuration of fatty acids was determined as described (18Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—Structural assignments of OS1, one-dimensional, and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a solution of 5 mg in 0.6 ml of D2O, at 300 K, at pD 7 (uncorrected value). For structural assignment of OS2, spectra were recorded on a solution of 1% deuterated SDS with 5 μl of 32% NH4OH at 298 K at pD 9.5 (uncorrected value). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were measured on Bruker DRX-400 (OS1) and Varian INOVA 500 (OS2). Spectra were calibrated with internal acetone (δH 2.225, δC 31.45). 31P NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer, and aqueous 85% phosphoric acid was used as an external reference (0.00 ppm). Nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) and rotating frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy were measured using data sets (t1 × t2) of 4096 × 512 points, and 16 scans were acquired. A mixing time of 200 ms was used. Double quantum-filtered phase-sensitive correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) experiment was performed with a 0.258-s acquisition time, using data sets of 4096 × 1024 points, and 64 scans were acquired. Total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments were performed with a spinlock time of 120 ms, using data sets (t1 × t2) of 4096 × 512 points, and 16 scans were acquired. In all homonuclear experiments, the data matrix was zero-filled in the F1 dimension to give a matrix of 4096 × 2048 points and was resolution-enhanced in both dimensions by a shifted sine-bell function before Fourier transformation. Coupling constants were determined on a first order basis from DQF-COSY (19Piantini U. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 6800-6801Crossref Scopus (1880) Google Scholar, 20Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) experiments were measured in the 1H-detected mode via single quantum coherence with proton decoupling in the 13C domain, using data sets of 2048 × 512 points, and 64 scans were acquired for each t1 value. Experiments were carried out in the phase-sensitive mode according to the method of States et al. (21States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). The heteronuclear experiments were performed using pulse field gradient programs. 1H, 13CHMBC was optimized for a 6 Hz coupling constant, and 1H, 31P HSQC was optimized for an 8 Hz coupling constant. In all heteronuclear experiments, the data matrix was extended to 2048 × 1024 points using forward linear prediction extrapolation (22Stern A.S. Li K.-B. Hoch J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1982-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—Ions formed by the pulsed laser beam were accelerated through 24 kV. Each spectrum is the result of ∼200 laser shots. Mass spectra were assigned with a two-point external calibration. MALDI preparation of such highly anionic samples was set up with substantial modifications of the thin layer procedure described by Körner et al. (23Körner R. Limberg G. Mikkelsen J.D. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Sturiale L. Garozzo D. Silipo A. Lanzetta R. Parrilli M. Molinaro A. Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2005; 19: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for the analyses of enzymatic pectin digests. A small amount of the intact LOS was first suspended in a methanol/water 1:1 solution containing 5 mm EDTA and allowed to dissolve by a brief ultrasonication. A few microliters of the obtained mixture were then desalted on a small piece of Parafilm ® with some grains of cation exchange beads (Dowex 50WX8-200; Sigma), previously converted in the ammonium form. 0.3 μl of this sample solution were finally deposited, together with the same volume of 20 mm dibasic ammonium citrate, in a thin layer of homogeneous matrix film obtained from a solution, the components of which are 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone (200 mg/ml in methanol), and nitrocellulose (Trans-blot membrane, Bio-Rad) (15 mg/ml in acetone/propan-2-ol) (1:1, v/v), mixed, respectively, in a 4:1 (v/v) ratio. Plant Tests—LOS and derived fractions were tested for their ability to prevent the HR in A. thaliana accession Columbia (Col-O) caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 carrying the avirulence gene avrRpm1 or avrRps4 (Pst avrRpm1, Pst avrRps4) (25Ritter E.

Plant Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fractions dissolved in water (50 μg ml-1) were infiltrated into 6-week-old leaves of Col-O. A control leaf was inoculated with water. The plants were placed in a growth cabinet at 25 °C with 16 h of light. After 20 h, these leaves were inoculated with Pst avrRPM1 or Pst avrRps4 (107 colony-forming units ml-1) in both the area treated with one of the compounds and in the water-treated area. Development or suppression of HR were followed over 24 h in the LOS, core oligosaccharide, lipid A pretreated, and control (water-treated) areas as described previously (27Newman M.-A. von Roepenack-Lahaye E. Parr A. Daniels M.J. Dow J.M. Plant J. 2002; 29: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Growth of the virulent bacteria Pst DC3000 was followed in the plant tissue in the LOS, core oligosaccharide, lipid A-pretreated, and control (water-treated) areas as described (28Newman M.-A. Daniels M.J. Dow J.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The mean and S.D. of three separate measurements at each time point are given. Analysis of PR1 and PR2 Gene Expression—LOS and derived fractions were dissolved in water (50 μg ml-1) and infiltrated into 6-week-old leaves of Col-O. A further set of leaves was inoculated with water. The plants were placed in a growth cabinet at 25 °C with 16 h of light. The leaves were harvested 4, 12, 20, and 24 h after inoculation. The changes in PR1 and PR2 gene expression were followed using quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR analysis exactly as described (10Bedini E. De Castro C. Erbs G. Mangoni L. Dow J.M. Newman M.-A. Parrilli M. Unverzagt C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 2414-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PR-1 and PR-2 primer pairs (PR-1 forward, 5′-GTGGGTTAGCGAGAAGGCTA-3′; PR-1 reverse, 5′-ACTTTGGCACATCCGAGTCT-3′; PR-2 forward, 5′-TCAAGGAAGGTTCAGGGATG-3′; PR-2 reverse, 5′-AGATTCACGAGCAAGGGAGA-3′) were designed using the gene sequence for PR1 assigned AT2g14610 and PR2 assigned AT3G57260 in the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative 3 and the primer3 program (available on the World Wide Web at frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3.cgi) as described (10Bedini E.

Compositional Analysis of Xcc LOS and Structural Characterization of the Fully Deacylated LOS Fraction—Fatty acids composition, compositional and linkage analysis of carbohydrates obtained by GLC-MS are reported in TABLE ONE. All monosaccharides are in D configuration, and fatty acids are in R configuration. The approach to define the primary structure of Xcc LOS was to employ two chemical degradations followed by compositional and two-dimensional NMR and MS analyses of the obtained compounds.TABLE ONEMonosaccharides and fatty acid components of LOS, OS1, and OS2AssignmentCharacteristic ion peaks (m/z)LOSOS1OS26-Substituted GlcNp117, 159, 189, 233xxx5-Substituted Kdop72, 146, 206, 394xxx4-Substituted Manp118, 233xxxTerminal GalpA118, 162, 163, 207x−xTerminal Glcp118, 161, 162, 205xxx3-Substituted Glcp118, 161, 234, 277xxx3-Substituted Manp118, 161, 234, 277xxxTerminal Manp118, 161, 162, 205xxx10:0 (3-OH)103, 184, 201x−−Iso and iso-ante 11:0 (3-OH)103, 198, 215x−−12:0 (3-OH)103, 212, 229x−xIso and iso-ante 13:0 (3-OH)103, 226, 243x−x10:074, 87, 155, 186x−−11:074, 87, 169, 200x−− Open table in a new tab The LOS fraction was completely deacylated by anhydrous hydrazine and hot KOH. The compositional analysis (TABLE ONE) of the product obtained, OS1, revealed the presence of t-Manp, t-Glcp, 3-Manp 3-Glcp, 4-Manp, 5-Kdop, and 6-GlcpN; no uronic acids were detected. The NMR analysis (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, 31P-1H and 13C-1H HSQC, 13C-1H HMBC) of OS1 showed the existence of a mixture of two oligosaccharides differing in the length of sugar backbone. The anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectrum showed six signals (A-F′, Fig. 1, TABLE TWO and supplemental Fig. 1), and their area suggested that two of them, B and C, were in a 1:2 ratio with respect to the others. In the NMR spectra, the two α- and β-GlcN residues (A and E, respectively) of the lipid A backbone were clearly identified, since the anomeric signals at 5.65 and 5.00 ppm were correlated to the expected carbon signals at 92.0 and 100.7 ppm, respectively, and their H-2 signals, at 3.35 and 3.04 ppm, were correlated to the nitrogen-bearing carbon signals at 55.7 and 59.7 ppm, respectively. In addition, the high multiplicity of the anomeric signal of A indicated the phosphorylation of the anomeric position. Residues B (H-1 at 5.28 ppm), C (H-1 at 5.13 ppm), and D (H-1 at 5.09) possessed α-manno-configurations, as shown by both 3JH1,H2 and 3 JH2,H3 values around 2-3 Hz. The H-1 signal of F/F′ at 4.58 ppm was assigned to glucose residues with β-configuration as shown by the strong intraresidual NOE contacts measured among H-1, H-3, and H-5 of F/F′. Because of the absence of the anomeric proton signal, the spin system of Kdo G (Fig. 1) was identified starting from the diasterotopic H-3 methylene protons found in a shielded region at 1.87 and 2.08 ppm (H-3ax and H-3eq, respectively). The α-configuration at C-2 was attributed by the chemical shift values of H-3eq and the by values of 3JH-7,H-8a and 3JH-7,H-8b (29Birnbaum G.I. Roy R. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. J. Carbohydr.

Residues C and F′ were terminal sugars. The interresidual NOE contacts of the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 2a) and the scalar correlations present in the HMBC spectrum (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 2) were used to infer the sequence of residues in the oligosaccharide chain and to confirm the glycosylation positions. The linkage between glucosamine residues A and E of the lipid A backbone was validated by the interresidual NOE contact of H-1 E (5.00 ppm) with H-6a,b A (4.26/3.90 ppm). The weak downfield shift of C-6 E (63.7 ppm) was in agreement with the α-(2→6) ketosidic linkage of Kdo G with residue E of β-GlcN. The NOE correlation of H-5 G with H-1 D together with the HMBC correlation H-1 D/C-5 G proved the linkage between residues of Kdo G and α-Man D. Residue D was in turn substituted at O-4 by residue F/F′, according to the NOE connectivity of H-4 D with H-1 F/F′ and the HMBC long range correlation C-4 D/H-1 F/F′. Residue F′ was a terminal glucose, whereas residue F was further substituted at O-3 by a nonstoichiometric disaccharide formed by the two residues of mannose B and C (Fig. 1). NOE contacts between H-1 C and H-3 B and the HMBC correlations H-1 C/C-3 B were diagnostic of the presence of a α-(1→3) mannose disaccharide, which was linked at O-3 of β-glucose F by residue B, as confirmed by NOE contact of H-1 B with H-3 F and the long range correlation H-1 B/C-3 F. The 31P-1H HSQC spectrum showed three cross-peaks, whose 31P chemical shifts were in accordance with the presence of three phosphate groups. Two of these signals, at 3.11 and 4.52 ppm, that correlated with the proton signals at 5.65 and 3.72 ppm, respectively, were identified as H-1 of α-GlcN A and H-4 of β-GlcN E composing the lipid A backbone. The third phosphate group was linked at O-3 of α-Man D, as shown by the cross-peak between the 31P signal at 3.45 ppm and H-4 D at 4.56 ppm. Thus, these above results can be summarized as indicating the presence of a mixture of two oligosaccharides, differing in the length of the sugar backbone because of the presence of a terminal α-(1→3) disaccharide of mannose linked in nonstoichiometric amount at O-3 of β-d-Glc F (Fig. 1). Structural Characterization of the De-O-acylated LOS Fraction—In order to detect the presence of alkaline labile substituents (i.e. phosphate residues) probably lost by harsh alkaline treatment, the LOS was only de-O-acylated by mild hydrazinolysis. The obtained product (OS2) was subjected to a complete chemical and NMR investigations, which revealed the presence of a complex mixture of oligosaccharides. The NMR spectra were recorded on a solution of 1% deuterated SDS with 5 μl of 32% NH4OH (298 K, pD 9.5). In full accordance with the GLC-MS analysis of OS2 (TABLE ONE), the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a) showed two additional spin systems with respect to OS1 that were identified as two residues of α-GalA, M and H. The chemical shifts and multiplicity of their H-1 signals suggested that they were both coupled to phosphate signals. The assignment of the other spin systems already detected in the previous analysis was straightforward (TABLE THREE).TABLE THREE1H, 13C (italic type) and 31P (boldface type) chemical shifts (ppm) of de-O-acylated core-lipid A backbone (OS2) of LOS from X. campestris pv. campestrisResidueChemical shift δ (1H/13C/31P)12345678M5.543.693.814.204.49t-α-GalA95.368.269.369.671.9174.0−1.9H5.493.763.824.174.34t-α-GalA95.767.569.570.773.3174.0−0.9A5.263.663.823.584.314.00/3.766-α-GlcN93.154.171.368.973.468.02.94B5.114.053.773.603.703.583-α-Man101.370.277.966.173.062.4C4.974.243.713.483.593.50/3.60t-α-Man102.469.470.267.173.462.4F4.4163.163.503.203.323.733-β-Glc102.473.876.070.376.060.8F′4.4163.163.503.203.323.73t-β-Glc102.473.876.070.376.060.8G2.08/1.814.504.323.854.043.685-α-Kdo174.1100.934.470.973.873.170.363.3−0.9E4.453.733.663.673.543.73/3.616-β-GlcN102.455.273.574.374.061.15.23D-X4.973.914.334.173.833.73/3.534-α-Man100.568.673.774.373.062.4−1.9D-Y5.244.594.494.003.693.90/3.704-α-Man97.676.177.575.173.561.916.216.2 Open table in a new tab In the 31P NMR spectrum (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2083660727,"Proteins of the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) secretion system-1 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not only strongly involved in the anti-mycobacterial Th1-host immune response but are also key players for virulence. In this study, protein engineering together with bioinformatic, immunological, and virulence analyses allowed us to pinpoint regions of the ESAT-6 molecule that are critical for its biological activity in M. tuberculosis. Mutation of the Trp-Xaa-Gly motif, conserved in a wide variety of ESAT-6-like proteins, abolished complex formation with the partner protein CFP-10, induction of specific T-cell responses, and virulence. Replacement of conserved Leu residues interfered with secretion, coiled-coil formation, and virulence, whereas certain mutations at the extreme C terminus did not affect secretion but caused attenuation, possibly because of altered ESAT-6 targeting or trafficking. In contrast, the mutation of several residues on the outer surface of the four-helical bundle structure of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex showed much less effect. Construction of recombinant BCG expressing ESAT-6 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag allowed us to co-purify ESAT-6 and CFP-10, experimentally confirming their strong interaction both in and outside of the mycobacterial cell. The strain induced potent, antigen-specific T-cell responses and intermediate in vivo growth in mice, suggesting that it remained immunogenic and biologically active despite the tag.

Together with previous NMR data, the results of this study have allowed a biologically relevant model of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex to be constructed that is critical for understanding the structure-function relationship in tuberculosis pathogenesis. Several attenuated or avirulent members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, like Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), the vole bacillus Mycobacterium microti, or the dassie bacillus, are deleted for an overlapping portion of the genome, known as region of difference 1 (RD1) 4The abbreviations used are: RD1, region of difference 1; ESAT, early secreted antigenic target; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; IFN, interferon; GFP, green fluorescent protein.

Among the proteins predicted to be involved in this process are a member of the AAA-family of ATPases (Rv3868), which may perform chaper-one-like functions by assisting in the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes and several putative membrane proteins with 1, 3, or 11 transmembrane domains (Rv3869, Rv3870, Rv3877) or ATP binding sites (Rv3871), which could be involved in forming a transmembrane channel for the translocation of the effector molecules.

ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which have been shown to form a 1:1 complex in vitro (15Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), belong to a large family of small proteins identified in Gram-positive bacteria. Proteins of this family have a size of ∼100 amino acids and are characterized by a conserved motif Trp-Xaa-Gly (WXG) (16Pallen M.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 209-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the structure-function relationship in members of the ESAT-6, or WXG, family, a strategy has been developed to study variants of ESAT-6 in its natural bacterial host. The residues to be modified were selected according to their potential importance for secretion, immunogenicity and virulence. Among them were several amino acids that are highly conserved among ESAT-6 orthologs from different bacterial species. Other regions of interest were the N and C termini of the protein. We were also interested in identifying modifications that would allow the specific binding of biologically active ESAT-6 to selected matrices and modifications that may be used to localize ESAT-6 in cell biological experiments. Here we describe the behavior of these mutant strains in immunogenicity and virulence tests relative to control strains and show how the modifications allowed new features of ESAT-6 and the corresponding secretion system to be discovered. Genetic Constructs and Mycobacterial Strains—In the present study our aim was to introduce extra sequences or base substitutions into previously used cosmid pRD1–2F9 (12Pym A.S. Brodin P. Brosch R. Huerre M. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) to obtain BCG and/or M. tuberculosis strains that produce and export genetically modified variants of ESAT-6. To achieve these constructs, modified 1.5-kb HpaI/SapI fragments spanning the 3′-end of ppe68 (rv3873), esxB (rv3874), esxA (rv3875) and the 5′-end of rv3876 were produced by using primer pairs containing selected restriction sites and/or extra sequences (see TABLE ONE and supplemental Table S1). PCR amplification was done as described previously (5Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Marmiesse M. Brodin P. Buchrieser C. Eiglmeier K. Garnier T. Gutierrez C. Hewinson G. Kremer K. Parsons L.M. Pym A.S. Samper S. van Soolingen D. Cole S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3684-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) except for the use of Pwo high fidelity polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) instead of Taq polymerase. Each PCR product was column-purified (Qiagen), restriction enzyme-digested, and subjected to gel-purification using 1% low melting agarose (Bio-Rad), and gelase (Epicenter) as described previously (17Brosch R. Gordon S.V. Billault A. Garnier T. Eiglmeier K. Soravito C. Barrell B.G. Cole S.T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2221-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the purification and size selection step, corresponding fragments were cloned together into EcoRI/HindIII-digested, gel-purified pUC19. DNA of colonies that contained the desired fragment was HpaI/SapI-digested, and then the 1.5-kb fragment obtained was ligated into HpaI/SapI cut pRD1–2F9 from which the original 1.5-kb fragment had been removed. For construction of EsxA fusion proteins like EsxA-eGFP, EsxA-EsxR (Rv3019c), or EsxA fused to EsxA (ML0049) from Mycobacterium leprae, PCR fragments obtained with primers listed in supplemental Table S1 were cloned into modified cosmid pRD1–2F9 containing an in-frame SpeI cloning site just before the stop codon of esxA. The various constructs were subjected to sequence analysis of the modified region as well as XhoI restriction profile comparison using the original pRD1–2F9 as a control. Undigested highly concentrated cosmid DNA preparations were then electroporated into electrocompetent cells of M. tuberculosis H37RvΔRD1 (gift from William R. Jacobs, Jr.), or BCG Pasteur 1173P2. Hygromycin-resistant colonies appearing after 2–3 weeks were analyzed for the presence of the integrated cosmid by PCR, using primers specific for ESX-1 genes as previously described (9Pym A.S.

Based on the coiled-coil prediction and available experimental evidence, we used the structure of the four-helical-bundle structure of the cytoplasmic domain of a serine chemotaxis receptor (18Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) to build a model of the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 complex. In this model, the amino acids in position “a” and “d” of the helices in the template were occupied as far as possible by hydrophobic amino acids. In agreement with reported NMR data the two resulting helical hairpins for CFP-10 and ESAT-6 were put side-by-side and antiparallel, with the WXG motif at opposite ends of the complex structure. Structures were refined with a short molecular dynamics/simulated annealing protocol (19Nilges M. Brunger A.T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), restraining the experimentally known helical elements (Ala8–Gln40 and Ala46–Gly80 for CFP-10; Phe8–Trp43 and Glu49–Ala84 for ESAT-6) (20Renshaw P.S.

Protein Extraction, Column Purification, and Immunoblotting—Cell-free protein extracts were prepared from early log phase cultures of recombinant strains grown in 7H9 or Sauton's medium and processed by standard procedures. Culture filtrates were concentrated using a Millipore filter with a 3-kDa cutoff. Western blots and antigen detection were performed as described previously, using anti-ESAT-6 monoclonal antibodies (HYB 076-08) purchased from the Statens Serum Institute (Denmark) and in-house polyclonal antibodies directed against CFP-10 or PPE-68 (12Pym A.S. Brodin P. Brosch R. Huerre M. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were purified using mini-columns containing 80 μl Ni2+-NTA-agarose. Cell lysates or culture filtrates were passed through the mini-columns then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) with 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm imidazole. Bound protein was eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 300 mm NaCl and 250 mm imidazole. Samples were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and separated by SDS-PAGE (15%), before blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Monoclonal anti-ESAT-6, anti-HIS or polyclonal CFP-10 antibodies were used for immune detection.

Mutation of Conserved Residues of ESAT-6 Identifies Biologically Important Amino Acids—Sequence alignment of ESAT-6 orthologs from M. tuberculosis and M. leprae revealed that 33 amino acids are conserved between the 2 ESAT-6 molecules, and 13 of these are also conserved in ESAT-6 like proteins from the phylogenetically more distant species Corynebacterium diphtheriae (Fig. 1A). Thirteen residues scattered along the M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 molecule were selected for mutation in pRD1–2F9 (Fig. 1A), and the resultant cosmids were integrated into a M. tuberculosis ΔRD1 strain (H37RvΔRD1) (7Hsu T. Hingley-Wilson S.M. Chen B. Chen M. Dai A.Z. Morin P.M. Marks C.B. Padiyar J. Goulding C. Gingery M. Eisenberg D. Russell R.G. Derrick S.C. Collins F.M. Morris S.L. King C.H. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12420-12425Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Using our cloning strategy, recombinant M. tuberculosis strains that expressed ESAT-6 with one or two amino acid replacements were obtained and screened for secretion of ESAT-6, immunogenicity, and virulence (TABLE ONE). Among the 13 mutants tested, 7 showed enhanced in vivo growth after 3–4 weeks of infection in SCID mice, as witnessed by splenomegaly and high bacterial counts in lungs and spleen, whereas 5 mutant strains showed characteristics similar to the H37RvΔRD1::YUB412 vector control (TABLE ONE and Fig. 2). One strain showed reduced, intermediate virulence. For most samples, the variant ESAT-6 proteins and CFP-10 were found in the culture supernatant (Fig. 1B). We had previously noticed that an enhanced in vivo growth phenotype was only observed when ESAT-6 was secreted. Thus, these findings suggest that loss of virulence in 4 of the 5 attenuated mutants is not caused by defective secretion but rather because of potential loss of interaction with protein partners or putative receptors. For further analysis of these results we used bioinformatic tools. Most interestingly, when we screened ESAT-6 and CFP-10 for the presence of coiled-coil motives using the MultiCoil program (21Wolf E. Kim P.S. Berger B. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1179-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), a high probability of multimeric coiled-coil formation was found (supplemental Fig. S1). These observations together with the results from the virulence assay of mutant strains and structural data from the available literature (15Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Renshaw P.S. Veverka V. Kelly G. Frenkiel T.A.

Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Buxton R.S. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 238: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar), allowed us to build a model of the ESAT-6·CFP-10 protein complex, which is crucial for the interpretation of the observed effects of ESAT-6 mutations on virulence. As shown in Fig. 2, mutations that abolish virulence concern residues Leu28–Leu29, important for the stability of the hairpin/coiled-coil structure of the molecule, residues Trp43 and Gly45 that constitute the loop and contain the conserved WXG motif, as well as residues Val90 and Phe94 in the extreme C-terminal tail. Similarly, M93I, also located at the extreme C terminus, showed reduced, intermediate virulence. The other tested mutants (T2H, Q4L, F8I, A14R, Q55I/Q56A, N66I/N67A, M83I) did not abolish the virulence of the recombinant M. tuberculosis strains in SCID mice as shown by splenomegaly and different degrees of enhanced in vivo growth rates (TABLE ONE). As shown in Fig. 2, these mutations affect residues in the N- or C-terminal regions (T2H, Q4L, M83I), are predicted to be at the outer surface of the four-helical bundle structure (A14R, Q56A, N66I, N67A), or are conservative in the sense that the mutated residue can stabilize the structure in a similar way: F8I replaces an aromatic by a hydrophobic residue, Q55I replaces a polar residue in the interior by a hydrophobic residue. In our model, Gln55 is mostly surrounded by hydrophobic amino acids, and its replacement by a hydrophobic residue could probably be accommodated by small rearrangements in the structure. Together, these results suggest that correct ESAT-6·CFP-10 complex formation is an important requirement for ESX-1-induced increased virulence of M. tuberculosis. To obtain experimental evidence of the protein-protein interaction involved in this process, we genetically engineered recombinant BCG strains that expressed and secreted HIS-tagged ESAT-6 and CFP-10 molecules. Tagged ESAT-6 and CFP-10 Molecules in BCG Allow Co-purification of Protein Partners—When concentrated culture filtrates of recombinant BCG expressing ESAT-6-HIS at the C terminus were applied to a Ni2+-affinity column, two bands of low molecular weight were visible after elution (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, Western blot analyses identified the upper band as CFP-10, and the lower band as ESAT-6-HIS. The 2 molecules, overexpressed as recombinant proteins by Escherichia coli have previously been shown to interact, forming a 1:1 protein complex in in vitro experiments (15Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Okkels L.M. Andersen P. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2487-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results confirm these observations and further demonstrate that in mycobacteria, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are indeed present as a protein complex. To our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence that these 2 molecules form a tight complex even after being secreted by their proper secretion machinery. We also observed the same binding behavior using samples of the cytosolic fraction of BCG::2F9-EsxA-HIS (Fig. 3B), indicating that the 2 molecules interact already shortly after synthesis. The specificity of this interaction is shown by the results obtained with a C-terminal HIS-tagged ESAT-6 W43R BCG mutant. Most interestingly, for this strain ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are found in the supernatant, but co-purification was no longer possible (Fig. 3C), suggesting that mutation of a single residue, W43R, was sufficient to reduce the affinity between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in such a way that binding between the two antigens did not occur under the given pH conditions. This finding is also of interest for the interpretation of results obtained by virulence screening of mutant strains. As shown above, mutation W43R was associated with attenuation. When CFP-10 carrying an N-terminal HIS tag was purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, ESAT-6 was obtained after elution of bound HIS-CFP-10 (Fig. 3, A and B), although the amounts of ESAT-6 co-purified with CFP-10 were lower, probably because of weaker expression of ESAT-6/HIS-CFP-10 in this mutant strain relative to BCG::2F9-EsxA-HIS and/or interference of the N-terminal tag with the binding capacity of CFP-10. However, this experiment confirmed the strong interaction of these 2 molecules both in and outside the mycobacterial cell and the utility of the attached HIS tag for purification of proteins produced by slow growing mycobacteria. Like the ESAT-6-W43R mutant, a double band was observed for the HIS-tagged molecule, induced by the tag. In contrast to the results obtained with the C-terminal HIS-tagged ESAT-6, an N-terminal HIS tag for ESAT-6 was not effective for purification of the protein from BCG by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (data not shown), as the N-terminal HIS tag had been removed or cleaved from the ESAT-6 molecule in the cytosol, possibly by the action of an endopeptidase (supplemental Fig. S2, A B). Furthermore, ESAT-6 carrying the N-terminal HIS tag did not induce ESAT-6- and CFP-10-specific IFN-γ production by splenocytes of infected mice upon restimulation with the antigen, despite being secreted (Fig. 4D). From these experiments we concluded that ESAT-6 with the C-terminal HIS tag resembles native ESAT-6, produced by M. tuberculosis, more closely than the N-terminal HIS construct. Larger ESAT-6 Fusion Proteins Are Difficult to Transport Outside the Mycobacterial Cell—As shown by using hexahistidine tags, modified ESAT-6 proteins containing more amino acids than the wild type protein are still secreted by the ESAT-6 system-1. To evaluate whether this secretion machinery could be used to export larger fusion proteins, which may be of importance for the development of new recombinant vaccines, we constructed various ESAT-6 protein fusions and tested whether they were exported. One of them, EsxA-EsxR, ESAT-6 fused at its C terminus with EsxR (Rv3019c), was secreted into the supernatant in sufficient amounts to be detected by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. S3B). For this construct, CFP-10 was also found in the supernatant. However, because of the larger size and different structure, much of the fusion protein was retained in the cell wall fraction, where wild type ESAT-6 was not present (supplemental Fig. S3B). Another recombinant protein, ESAT-6 fused to the ESAT-6 orthologue of M. leprae (MLEsxA, ML0049), was strongly expressed, but only very little amounts of the protein were detected in the culture supernatant, suggesting that the structural conformation of this fusion protein did not match the requirements of the secretion machinery. As with EsxA-EsxR, the EsxA-MLEsxA fusion protein was present in the cell wall fraction (data not shown). We also constructed an ESAT-6-C-terminal GFP fusion and obtained recombinant BCG that were characterized by green fluorescent colonies. Western blot analysis of the culture supernatant of this recombinant BCG strain showed a large fusion protein that reacted with the ESAT-6 monoclonal antibody, and infection of native macrophages revealed that the ESAT-6-GFP fusion protein was expressed in the engulfed bacteria (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). However, this ESAT-6-GFP fusion protein, which is several times larger than ESAT-6 alone, did not induce ESAT-6-specific T-cell responses in C57BL/6 mice and did not increase virulence in SCID mice (data not shown), indicating that ESAT-6 fused to GFP had lost its biological function. For this reason, constructs that only contain small tags are better suited to preserve the biological function of the ESAT-6 molecule and still allow specific purification and detection procedures to be employed. Analysis of IFN-γ Responses and Virulence Defines Three Groups of Mutant Strains—To monitor the biological effects of the various genetic modifications of ESAT-6, intravenous infection of SCID mice and recording of IFN-γ responses from splenocytes of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were used. First, we observed that the tested strains that induced an IFN-γ response to ESAT-6 were also found to cause splenomegaly and enhanced in vivo growth in SCID mice. However, variation in virulence occurred, as for some strains (e.g. BCG::2F9-EsxA-HIS) growth in SCID mice was less pronounced (TABLE ONE, Fig. 4A). A few selected strains were also tested in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice by aerosol infection. This approach revealed that strain BCG::2F9-EsxA-HIS was able to multiply in the lungs of these mice but to a lesser degree than the BCG::RD1-2F9 control and the BCG::2"
https://openalex.org/W2157735736,"The measurement of phase in coherent electron systems—that is, ‘mesoscopic’ systems such as quantum dots—can yield information about fundamental transport properties that is not readily apparent from conductance measurements. Phase measurements on relatively large quantum dots1 recently revealed that the phase evolution for electrons traversing the dots exhibits a ‘universal’ behaviour, independent of dot size, shape, and electron occupancy2,3. Specifically, for quantum dots in the Coulomb blockade regime, the transmission phase increases monotonically by π throughout each conductance peak; in the conductance valleys, the phase returns sharply to its starting value. The expected mesoscopic features in the phase evolution—related to the dot's shape, spin degeneracy or to exchange effects—have not been observed, and there is at present no satisfactory explanation for the observed universality in phase behaviour4. Here we report the results of phase measurements on a series of small quantum dots, having occupancies of between only 1–20 electrons, where the phase behaviour for electron transmission should in principle be easier to interpret. In contrast to the universal behaviour observed thus far only in the larger dots, we see clear mesoscopic features in the phase measurements when the dot occupancy is less than ∼10 electrons. As the occupancy increases, the manner of phase evolution changes and universal behaviour is recovered for some 14 electrons or more. The identification of a transition from the expected mesoscopic behaviour to universal phase evolution should help to direct and constrain theoretical models for the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2119802141,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) has diverse effects on T cells that are mediated by the predominant S1P1 and S1P4 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). S1P4 is expressed principally by leukocytes, but little is known of its T cell effects in immunity. Two approaches were used to investigate S1P4 signals in T cells. First, S1P4 was introduced into D10G4.1 mouse Th2 cells and EL4.IL-2 mouse T cells lacking endogenous S1P GPCRs. Second, mouse splenic CD4 T cells were treated with FTY720 to suppress S1P1 and leave S1P4 GPCRs as the only functionally relevant S1P receptor. Unlike S1P1, S1P4 failed to transduce chemotactic responses of any of the S1P4-only T cells to S1P or the phyto-S1P ligand selective for S1P4, or to suppress their chemotactic responses to chemokines. The S1P-S1P4 axis significantly inhibited T cell proliferation in each of the S1P4-only T cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 MoAbs. Secretion of IL-4 by S1P4-D10G4.1 cells, IL-2 by S1P4-EL4.IL-2, and IFN-gamma by FTY720-treated CD4 T cells were significantly inhibited by S1P. In contrast, S1P enhanced secretion of IL-10 by stimulated S1P4-D10G4.1 T cells. Thus, S1P4 mediates immunosuppressive effects of S1P by inhibiting proliferation and secretion of effector cytokines, while enhancing secretion of the suppressive cytokine IL-10."

While they can fold independently, they often exist in tandem pairs where they pack in a head-tail manner (2Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct.

The BRCT repeats of BRCA1 have been shown to specifically bind to pSer-X-X-Phe peptide targets, such as the BACH1 helicase (5Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J.

Structural studies reveal that the NH2-terminal BRCT repeat is responsible for phosphoserine recognition, while the phenylalanine side chain is recognized by a pocket at the interface between the NH2- and COOH-terminal repeats (8Williams R.S. Lee M.S. Hau D.D. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Clapperton J.A. Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Ho T. Haire L.F. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J.

Mutations that perturb the phenylalanine recognition pocket disrupt phosphopeptide binding and explain the enhanced cancer risks associated with some of these mutations. MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint protein 1) is another BRCT repeat protein that plays a critical role in the DNA damage response. MDC1 has been implicated in the recognition and repair of DNA double strand breaks through its rapid co-localization with γ-H2AX, the COOH-terminally phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX, at the sites of double strand breaks in mammalian nuclei (11Stewart G.S. Wang B. Bignell C.R. Taylor A.M. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 12Goldberg M. Stucki M. Falck J. D'Amours D. Rahman D. Pappin D. Bartek J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). MDC1 also facilitates the recruitment of other repair proteins to these foci, including the MRE11 complex and the BRCT proteins 53BP1 and BRCA1, and is required for the efficient repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. The COOH-terminal BRCT repeats of MDC1 can specifically bind to phosphopeptides with specificity for a tyrosine residue at the +3 position relative to the phosphoserine and some specificity for a glutamic acid at the +2, matching the sequence of the γ-H2AX tail: Ser(P)-Gln-Glu-Tyr (13Rodriguez M. Yu X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52914-52918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the MDC1 BRCT repeats bind to the γ-H2AX tail in a manner that is critically dependent on the free carboxylate group of the COOH-terminal tyrosine residue. The crystal structure of the MDC1 BRCT repeats reveals a phosphoserine binding pocket and adjacent structural features that may explain the novel selectivity of this domain for the free COOH terminus of its phosphopeptide target. BRCT Expression and Purification—Human MDC1 BRCT domain (residues 1,891–2,086) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 Gold99 and purified as a GST fusion protein by glutathione affinity chromatography. MDC1 was then cleaved from GST using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the COOH-terminal MDC1 polypeptide was purified from GST by ion exchange chromatography. Crystallization and Structure Determination of MDC1 BRCT—MDC1 BRCT crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at room temperature. Native MDC1 (10 mg ml–1) in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution (22% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.0). Crystals of Se-methionine-substituted MDC1 were grown by mixing 2 μ l of 10 mg ml–1 BRCT domain with a 1.5-fold molar excess of a γ-H2AX peptide in protein solution (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with 2 μl of well solution (1.4 m NaH2PO4, 0.4 m K2HPO4, 0.1 m citrate, pH 4.2). No γ-H2AX peptide was found to be bound to MDC1 in these crystals. For cryopreservation, single crystals were soaked in the appropriate well solution supplemented with 26% (v/v) glycerol and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory. Data reduction and scaling were done using the HKL package (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Crystallographic phases for MDC1 were determined from a multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment on the Se-methionine-substituted protein derivative to 2.7 Å resolution. Multiple MDC1 molecules were assumed to be present in the asymmetric unit, and eight selenium sites were located with SOLVE (15Terwilliger T. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2004; 11: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) using data collected at two wavelengths. Electron density maps calculated from this solution were improved by density modification and NCS averaging in RESOLVE (FOM 0.67) and revealed three molecules in the asymmetric unit. Automatic (RESOLVE) and manual model building (using XFIT (16McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar)) produced a complete MDC1 model, which was partially refined using CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Peptides used for microcalorimetry contained the COOH-terminal sequence of H2AX, with an NH2-terminal “KKK” sequence to improve peptide solubility (acetyl-KKKTQApSQEY, γ-H2AX sequence in bold) and were prepared with or without an amide group blocking the COOH terminus (Alberta Peptide Institute). MDC1 and the phosphopeptides were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm TCEP. The Micro Calorimetry System (Microcal, Amherst, MA) was used to perform the ITC measurements for the interaction between the BRCT repeats and the peptides. The titration data, collected at 22 °C, were analyzed using the ORIGIN data analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Thermodynamic parameters reported are the average of three independent experiments. Intriguingly, not only the sequence of the H2AX tail, but also its position at the COOH terminus of the chain, is absolutely conserved in mammals (21Pilch D.R. Sedelnikova O.A. Redon C. Celeste A. Nussenzweig A. Bonner W.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). To test if the free carboxyl terminus of the tail is an important determinant of recognition, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the thermodynamics of binding between recombinant MDC1 tandem BRCT repeats and synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the γ-H2AX tail, with or without an amide group blocking the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1). The results show that MDC1 binds to the γ-H2AX tail with a free COOH terminus with high affinity (Kd = 2.2 ± 0.2 μm), similar to binding affinity of the BRCA1 BRCT for Ser(P)-X-X-Phe targets (5Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 10Shiozaki E.N. Gu L. Yan N. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The binding reaction is driven by favorable enthalpic (ΔH = –6.3 kcal/mole) and entropic (ΔS = 4.8 cal/mol/degree) contributions. In contrast, the same peptide with an amidated, and therefore uncharged, COOH terminus showed ∼100-fold weaker binding for MDC1 (Kd ∼150 μm). This reduction in binding affinity could be due to the loss of charge on the COOH-terminal residue and/or steric repulsion between MDC1 and the terminal amide. This result demonstrates that, unlike BRCA1, the MDC1 BRCT domain recognizes the COOH-terminal carboxylate of its phosphopeptide target with a high degree of specificity. To begin to understand the structural basis for MDC1 phosphopeptide recognition, we determined the x-ray crystal structure of the tandem BRCT repeats of MDC1 using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and a selenomethionine-substituted protein (TABLE ONE). The structure reveals that MDC1 bears a structure that is strikingly similar to that of the tandem BRCT repeats of BRCA1, despite the fact that these two protein domains are only 15% identical at the sequence level. Both proteins share many of the same major secondary structure elements and the NH2- and COOH-terminal BRCT repeats pack in the same head-to-tail manner seen in both BRCA1 (2Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and 53BP1 (3Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). To compare the putative peptide binding surface of MDC1 with that of BRCA1, we aligned the two structures based on a superimposition of key peptide-binding residues in BRCA1 with those in MDC1 (Fig. 2B). The superimposition reveals that the NH2-terminal BRCT repeat of MDC1 contains a phosphoserine recognition pocket that is nearly identical to that of BRCA1, despite the fact that a critical serine in BRCA1 (Ser1655) is a threonine in MDC1. The phosphate-binding ligands are the Oγ of Thr1898, the main chain NH of Gly1899, and the Nϵ of Lys1936. Thr1898 is held in place by a hydrogen bond with Thr, and the Nϵ of Lys1936is held in place by a hydrogen bond with the main chain oxygen of Phe1897. In contrast, the region of MDC1 corresponding to the +3 specificity pocket in BRCA1 shows only limited conservation. Arg1699 is critical for phosphopeptide recognition in BRCA1, and mutations of this residue have been uncovered in breast cancer patients (8Williams R.S. Lee M.S. Hau D.D. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 9Clapperton J.A. Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Ho T. Haire L.F. Yaffe M.B. Smerdon S.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 14: 405-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This residue hydrogen bonds to the main chain of the +3 residue of the peptide target in BRCA1, helping the phenylalanine side chain to dock into the specificity pocket. In MDC1, this residue is conserved (Arg1933) and adopts a nearly identical conformation to that seen in BRCA1. In both BRCA1 and MDC1, the guanidinium group of the arginine is held in place via a salt-bridging interaction a conserved with glutamic acid side (Glu2063 chain in MDC1, Glu1836 in BRCA1). The conservation of this critical arginine suggests that the +3 tyrosine of the γ-H2AX peptide will indeed bind at this site; however, the structure of the specificity pocket is otherwise quite different in both proteins. A key residue for phenylalanine recognition in BRCA1 is Met1775, which forms the base of the pocket and, when mutated to arginine, blocks peptide binding and is associated with cancer (8Williams R.S.

No similar hydrophobic residue is in this position in MDC1, and indeed, the loop at this position adopts a quite different and rigid conformation, due to the presence of four consecutive proline residues, which are not conserved in BRCA1. A comparison of the structure of the MDC1 BRCT with the structure of the BRCA1 BRCT-phosphopeptide complex suggests how the MDC1 specificity pocket may recognize the COOH-terminal tyrosine of γ-H2AX. We predict that the guanidinium group of the conserved Arg1933 will contact the carboxyl terminus, but this must not be sufficient, otherwise the BRCA1 BRCT would also be specific for the COOH-terminal carboxylate of the +3 residue. MDC1 also contains Arg1932, which could also form a salt bridge to the COOH-terminal carboxylate of γ-H2AX, although this would require a re-orientation of this side chain and a disruption of its salt bridging interactions with Asp1929. Arg1932 could also come into proximity with the conserved glutamic acid of γ-H2AX at the +2 position and could explain the observed binding preference for glutamic acid at this position (13Rodriguez M. Yu X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52914-52918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The specificity for tyrosine over phenylalanine at the COOH terminus of γ-H2AX may be explained by the presence of Gln2013, which is positioned to hydrogen bond with the tyrosine hydroxyl group, assuming this side chain is oriented in the pocket in a manner similar to that of the +3 phenylalanine in the BRCA1 structure. Thus, subtle differences between the specificity pockets of MDC1 and BRCA1 can explain the unique ability of the MDC1 BRCT to recognize the negatively charged COOH terminus of γ-H2AX and thereby be recruited to DNA double strand breaks.

https://openalex.org/W1999806882,"In this study we identified the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in signaling and biological effects of the angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/tie-2 receptor pathway. Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to Ang-1 (50 ng/ml) induced rapid and transient production of ROS, particularly superoxide anions. ROS production was attenuated by preincubation with a peptide (gp91ds-tat) that inhibits the association of the gp91(phox) subunit with the p47(phox) subunit of NADPH oxidase and by the expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac-1 (Rac1N17). These results suggest that ROS production in response to Ang-1 exposure originates mainly from a Rac-1-dependent NADPH oxidase. Overexpression of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and Rac1N17, as well as preincubation with selective inhibitors of NADPH oxidase augmented basal p38 phosphorylation, inhibited Ang-1-induced PAK-1 phosphorylation and potentiated Ang-1-induced Erk1/2 phosphorylation but had no influence on AKT and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation by Ang-1. Exposure to Ang-1 (100 ng/ml) for 5 h induced a threefold increase in endothelial cell migration, a response that was strongly inhibited by overexpression of antioxidants, Rac1N17, and selective NADPH oxidase inhibitors. We conclude that activation of tie-2 receptors by Ang-1 triggers the production of ROS through activation of NADPH oxidase and that ROS generation by Ang-1 promotes endothelial cell migration while negatively regulating Erk1/2 phosphorylation."

In contrast, substitution of Asp-157 with a cysteinyl coordination residue resulted in intact Cd2+ binding as well as full transport activity. A similar correlation was found for Zn2+ binding and transport, suggesting that Asp-157 is a metal coordination residue required for binding and transport of Cd2+ and Zn2+. The location of Asp-157 was mapped topologically to the hydrophobic core of transmembrane segment 5 (TM-5) where D157C was found partially accessible to thiol-specific labeling of maleimide polyethylene-oxide biotin. Binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+, but not Fe2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, protected D157C from maleimide polyethylene-oxide biotin labeling in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry analysis of YiiPD157A showed no detectable change in Fe2+ and Hg2+ calorimetric titrations, indicating that Asp-157 is not a coordination residue for Fe2+ and Hg2+ binding. Our results provided direct evidence for selective binding of Zn2+ and Cd2+ for to the highly conserved Asp-157 and defined its functional role in metal transport. The cation diffusion facilitators (CDF) are a ubiquitous family of metal transporters that play important roles in homeostasis of a wide range of divalent metal cations. Molecular identities of substrate-binding sites and their metal selectivity in the CDF family are thus far unknown.

Membrane transporters in the cation diffusion facilitator family are found both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Paulsen I. Saier M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This protein family of more than 400 genetically related members is characterized by a homologous hydrophobic N-terminal domain followed by a hydrophilic C-terminal domain that is variable both in sequence and length (2Bateman A. Coin L. Durbin R. Finn R.D. Hollich V. Griffiths-Jones S. Khanna A. Marshall M. Moxon S. Sonnhammer E.L. Studholme D.J. Yeats C. Eddy S.R.

Phenotype analyses of gene deletion and complementation have demonstrated that bacterial CDF transporters are involved in cellular resistance to a broad spectrum of divalent metal cations, including Zn2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Fe2+ (8Anton A.

To date, molecular identities of substrate-binding sites in CDF transporters have yet to be identified, and even less is known about metal binding selectivity at a molecular level. The Escherichia coli metal transporter YiiP (FieF) and its homolog ZitB are the two CDF proteins that were shown to function as an obligatory Zn2+/H+ antiporter (12Grass G. Otto M. Fricke B. Haney C.J. Rensing C. Nies D.H. Munkelt D. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 183: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This proton-linked antiport mechanism permits the free energy derived from the downhill H+ influx to be coupled to the uphill pumping of Zn2+ out of the cells. The kinetics of Zn2+/Cd2+ transport was described by a two-step process involving an initial binding step followed by a conformational transition that moves the metal ion across the membrane (14Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The binding of metal ions to YiiP exhibited distinctive heat reactions in response to calorimetric titrations of the Zn2+ → Cd2+ → Hg2+ series, leading to thermodynamic categorization of at least one mutually competitive binding site common to Zn2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+, and a set of noncompetitive binding sites (15Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other than binding to group 12 metal ions, YiiP was implicated to play a role in bacterial iron detoxification, suggesting that Fe2+ may be an additional substrate (12Grass G. Otto M. Fricke B. Haney C.J. Rensing C. Nies D.H. Munkelt D. Arch. Microbiol. 2005; 183: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Both Zn2+ and Fe2+ are borderline soft metal ions with a similar donor preference for a combination of three protein ligand groups as follows: the cysteine thiolate, histidine imidazole, and aspartate/glutamate carboxylate (16Frausto da Silva J. Williams R. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2001: 39-51Google Scholar). Phenotype analyses of two homologous CDF transporters, CzcD from Ralstonia metallidurans and ZitB from E. coli, demonstrated that mutating a highly conserved Asp residue in the putative TM-5 rendered host cells hypersensitive to zinc, probably because of a loss of zinc efflux pumping activities (17Anton A. Weltrowski K. Klebba A. Haney C. Grass G. Rensing C. Dietrich H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 7499-7507Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Asp appeared to be essential because expression of CzcDD158E, CzcDD158A, ZitBD163E, and ZitBD163A mutant proteins conferred no zinc resistance. It is not clear, however, whether this conserved CDF aspartate is directly involved in binding and transport of Zn2+ and/or Fe2+. In the present study, we sought to establish the functional role of the equivalent Asp residue in YiiP (Asp-157) by examining the effects of D157A and D157C mutations on metal binding and transport by using direct biophysical measurements. Furthermore, Asp-157 was localized to the hydrophobic core of TM-5 to establish a structural connection with the substrate translocation pathway where metal ions are selected and transported across the membrane. Metal binding to Asp-157 was found to be highly specific, with a strict selectivity for Zn2+ and Cd2+ over Hg2+, Fe2+, and other divalent metal ions that are thought to be the frequent CDF substrates. Because Asp-157 is one of the most conserved residues in the CDF family, selective metal binding to Asp-157 has broad structural and mechanistic implications. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cloning and construction of the expression plasmid pYiiP-His were described previously (15Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A mutant C287S was first prepared using the pYiiP-His plasmid DNA as template and an anti-parallel pair of primers. The resultant C287S plasmid DNA served as the parent for an additional 13 mutants, each containing a single cysteine substitution mutation at positions 10, 36, 70, 107, 144, 150, 153, 155, 157, 171, 172, 174, or 177. Sequences of these mutants were verified by DNA sequencing of both strands. Overexpression and Purification—YiiP and mutants were overexpressed with a C-terminal extension containing a thrombin cleavage site followed by six tandem histidine residues to facilitate protein purification. The expression host cells, BL21 (DE3) pLyS, were cultured in an auto-inducing medium for unattended protein overexpression (18Studier F.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 41: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4140) Google Scholar). Cells from overnight cultures were harvested, and membrane proteins were extracted using 7% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) as described previously (15Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The detergent-solubilized proteins were absorbed by three passages through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen), which was washed free of contaminants and eluted with an elevated imidazole concentration at 500 mm. The column eluate was immediately applied to a PG-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), yielding a desalted sample that was subsequently subjected to overnight thrombin digestion (Novagen) at a ratio of 0.5 units of thrombin per mg of protein. The completeness of thrombin digestion was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis, showing a complete conversion of the His tagged to a tag-free mass species. The resultant tag-free protein was incubated with 10 mm EDTA for 30 min and then applied to an TSK 3000SWXL size-exclusion HPLC column (TosoHaas), pre-equilibrated with a degassed HPLC buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 0.2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)). The purified protein was collected as a discrete chromatographic fraction using a Beckman SC100 fraction collector. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Protein aggregates and trace amounts of metal contaminants were removed by size exclusion HPLC prior to calorimetric titrations as described previously (15Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Calorimetric titrations were carried out on a Microcal MCS titration calorimeter (Microcal) at 25 °C. Metal titrants (chloride salts), typically in the concentration range of 0.25–0.5 mm, were dissolved in the same HPLC mobile phase used for protein purification. 1 mm ascorbate was added when FeCl2 was titrated. Titrants and protein samples were thoroughly degassed, and then 30–50 injections of an indicated titrant were made successively into a protein sample in 5-μl increments at 210–360-s intervals. Heats of titrant dilutions were measured by making identical injections into the HPLC buffer, subtracted from the corresponding total heats of reaction to yield net reaction heats. The titration data were deconvoluted based on a binding model containing either one or two sets of noninteracting binding sites by a nonlinear least squares algorithm using the Microcal Origin software. The binding enthalpy change ΔH, association constant Ka and the binding stoichiometry n were permitted to float during the least squares minimization process and were taken as the best fit values. Reconstitution and Stopped-flow Transport Assay—HPLC-purified YiiP, YiiPD157C, or YiiPD157A was reconstituted into liposomes made of E. coli polar lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described previously (14Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Control liposomes were prepared following exactly the same procedure without adding protein. 200 μm fluorescence indicator fluozin-1 (Molecular Probes) was encapsulated by two freeze-thaw cycles, followed by gel filtration to remove the untrapped dye. Transport experiments were performed at 8 °C on a stopped-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp.). Proteoliposomes and a transport assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 50 mm K2SO4, and either ZnSO4 or CdSO4 at an indicated concentration ranging from 0 to 4 mm, pH 7.3) were loaded into two separate syringes of equal volume, and transport reactions were initiated by pushing 60-μl fresh reactants at a 1:1 ratio through the 12-μl mixing cell at a flow rate of 20 ml/s. Zn2+ or Cd2+ concentrations in reaction mixtures were half of the concentrations in the initial transport assay buffers. Stopped-flow traces were the cumulative average of five successive recordings at 525 nm (excited at 490 nm). Liposome traces were collected as base lines and subtracted from proteoliposome traces to yield net fluorescence changes ΔF. ΔF/ΔFmax was obtained by normalizing ΔF to the maximum proteoliposome response elicited by a transport assay buffer containing 4 mm ZnSO4 or CdSO4 plus 2% n-octyl-β-d-glucoside used to solubilized proteoliposomes. Determination of Transport Kinetic Parameters—The rate of the fluorescence rise kobs was determined by least squares fit of the kinetic trace to a single exponential function using the data analysis software SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The following two-step kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) was used to describe the YiiP transport process (14Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12043-12050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), M+T1↔k1/k2MT1→k3T2+MSCHEME 1 where T1 and T2 are different conformational states of YiiP, and M is the metal ion substrate. k1, k2, and k3 are the rate constants. The dissociation constants of metal binding Kd = k2/k1. The relationship among k1, k2, and k3 is defined as Km = (k2 + k3)/k1. Application of the steady-state condition to the species MT1 gives Equation 1 as described previously (19Strickland S. Palmer G. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4048-4052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kobs=k1k3[M]k1[M]+k2+k3(Eq. 1) Thus, Equation 2, 1Kobs=1k3+Kmk3[M](Eq. 2) k3 and Km were determined by linear regression of 1/Kobs as a function of 1/[M]. MPB Labeling—MPB labeling was carried out with cells that expressed YiiP or a YiiP variant as indicated. Cells (1 ml) from overnight cultures in the auto-inducing medium were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a reaction buffer (0.5 ml) containing 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% sucrose, 0.25 mm TCEP, pH 7.5. A freshly prepared MPB stock solution (50 mm) was added to a final concentration of 2 mm, or an equal volume of double deionized water (20 μl) instead of MPB was added to a control sample as indicated. Cells were incubated with MPB at room temperature for 30 min with or without sonication (30 s), and then β-ME (20 mm) was added to quench the unreacted MPB. The resulting cells were pelleted again and washed, and membrane proteins were extracted using a solubilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1% DDM, 20% glycerol, 0.25 mm TCEP, pH 7.5) with brief sonication (1 min), followed by a 30-min incubation at 10 °C to achieve complete detergent solubilization. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min), and supernatants were collected and incubated with 20 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin for 30 min. The resin was washed free of contaminants with 2 ml of wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, and 0.25 mm TCEP, pH 7.0), and then eluted with 50 μl of elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM and 0.25 mm TCEP, pH 7.0). The purified proteins obtained were immediately subjected to fluorescence labeling. Fluorescence Labeling and Western Blot—The MPB-treated and purified proteins (∼0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.1 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (FM, Molecular Probes) in the presence of 10% SDS at room temperature for 20 min, and then β-ME was added to 10 mm to terminate the reaction. The resulting FM-treated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8–16% Tris-HCl precast polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The gel was visualized on a UV transilluminator and documented using a BioDoc-It System (Ultraviolet Products). After fluorescence detection, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Trans-blot semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and were exposed to a peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-biotin antibody (Sigma) for detection of MPB labeling by a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For FM labeling to membrane-bound YiiP variants, cells hosting the overexpression of a YiiP variant were harvested and resuspended in the reaction buffer, and then 1 mm FM was added with a brief sonication. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 10 mm β-ME was added to quench unreacted FM. The resulting cells were pelleted and washed, and the FM-treated proteins were purified as described above. Aliquots of purified proteins were either directly subjected to SDS-PAGE or subjected to another exposure of 0.1 mm fresh FM in the presence of 10% SDS, followed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins in the gels were visualized under UV light for fluorescence detection before being stained with Coomassie Blue for estimation of the total amount of proteins. Correlation between Cd2+ Binding and Transport—The transport of metal ions is a sequential process of equilibrium binding and energized movement of metal ions along one or more binding sites in a translocation pathway across the membrane (20Jardetzky O. Nature. 1966; 211: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). To establish the functional role of Asp-157 in metal binding and transport, we examined the effects of mutating Asp-157 to a cysteine or alanine residue, corresponding to a metal coordination or noncoordination residue. His-tagged YiiP and mutants were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography, followed by thrombin cleavage of the affinity tag, EDTA chelation of bound metal ions, and size exclusion HPLC purification to yield protein samples suitable for metal calorimetric titrations (15Chao Y. Fu D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17173-17180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cd2+ binding to YiiP, YiiPD157A, and YiiPD157C was examined directly by ITC at 25 °C, pH 7.0, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Examples of heat changes resulting from binding of incremental additions of Cd2+ and plots of the integrated heat per mol of Cd2+ as a function of the Cd2+/protein molar ratio are displayed in Fig. 1A. The heat effects generated by Cd2+ binding to YiiP and YiiPD157C dropped sharply near a stoichiometric equivalence point of 2.5, whereas the midpoint of binding heat changes for YiiPD157A occurred at 1.5, indicating a loss of 1 eq Cd2+-binding site by the D157A mutation. Accordingly, binding isotherms were fitted with a two-site model for YiiP and YiiPD157C and a one-site model for YiiPD157A. As shown in TABLE ONE, binding affinities, stoichiometries, and ΔH changes of site 1 and site 2 for YiiP and YiiPD157C are nearly identical and within experimental errors. Fit of YiiPD157A binding isotherm to a one-site model resulted in Ka = 7.3 ± 1.9 μm–1, n = 1.5 ± 0.1, and ΔH =–5.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the binding parameters of site 1 of both YiiP and YiiPD157C. Thus, a D157C mutation caused no change to both sites 1 and 2, whereas a D157A mutation completely abolished Cd2+ binding to site 2 but had no effect on site 1. Furthermore, the binding stoichiometries for site 2 were close to unity, suggesting that a D157A mutation disrupted one Cd2+-binding site per YiiP subunit.TABLE ONESummary of Cd2+ and Zn2+ binding parametersTitrantProteinSite 1Site 2nKaΔHnKaΔHμm-1kcal/molμm-1kcal/molCdCl2YiiP1.5 ± 0.17.9 ± 2.7-5.8 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.5-7.8 ± 0.7YiiPD157A1.5 ± 0.17.3 ± 1.9-5.7 ± 0.2YiiPD157C1.4 ± 0.17.5 ± 1.8-5.5 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.3-6.9 ± 0.3ZnCl2YiiP0.6 ± 2.40.0069 ± 0.002922 ± 862.0 ± 0.14.2 ± 14-3.1 ± 0.2YiiPD157A0.7 ± 3.10.061 ± 0.0113.4 ± 1.71.1 ± 0.126 ± 14-2.7 ± 0.2YiiPD157C0.6 ± 1.80.0079 ± 0.002135 ± 111.9 ± 0.114 ± 29-1.7 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab The ITC data indicated the presence of at least two Cd2+-binding sites, each of which could play a structural, functional, or regulatory role. To examine a possible correlation between Cd2+ binding to Asp-157 and Cd2 transport, HPLC-purified YiiP, YiiPD157A, and YiiPD157C were reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and the kinetics of Cd2+ transport was analyzed by stopped-flow measurements of fluorescence changes of an encapsulated Zn2+/Cd2+-sensitive indicator, fluozin-1, in response to rapid mixtures of proteoliposomes with Cd2+ exterior to vesicles. SDS-PAGE analysis of proteoliposome samples confirmed that approximately the same amount of YiiP, YiiPD157A, and YiiPD157C was reconstituted into vesicles. Mixing proteoliposomes with external Cd2+ evoked rapid and progressive fluorescence increases that were dependent of Cd2+ concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mm in the reaction mixture as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Liposomes prepared in parallel to proteoliposomes only yielded negligible background fluorescence responses. A linear correlation between the initial rates of fluorescence responses and the molar ratios of YiiP/lipid was observed, indicating a linear relationship between the initial rate and the transport activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, the fluorescence responses of YiiP and YiiPD157C were comparable in amplitudes within the Cd2+ concentration range, in contrast to greatly diminished responses of YiiPD157A that were reduced to a background level. This significant impairment of the transport activity was attributed to the removal of a metal coordination group by a D157A mutation, because an Asp → Cys substitution only caused insignificant kinetic changes within experimental errors. Linear regression of 1/kobs versus 1/[Cd2+] using kinetic data from three experiments (Fig. 1B, inset) yielded Km values of 266 ± 20 and 304 ± 32 μm for YiiP and YiiPD157C, respectively. The k3 values for YiiP and YiiPD157C were identical and within experimental errors (26 ± 6 s–1). Correlation between Zn2+ Binding and Transport—In contrast to the pure exothermic heat reactions during Cd2+ titrations, Zn2+ titrations shown in Fig. 2A displayed a mixed heat reaction that began with exothermic and followed by late endothermic heat changes. In addition to the main exothermic-to-endothermic transition, another enthalpic transition was evident at the beginning of Zn2+ titrations where exothermic heat effects increased progressively. The overall profile of the YiiPD157C binding isotherm was comparable with that of YiiP, but the binding isotherm of YiiPD157A showed a leftward shift of the exothermic-to-endothermic transition by about 1 stoichiometry unit, qualitatively corresponding to the loss of one exothermic binding site. To a first approximation, Zn2+ binding isotherms were fitted with two sets of independent binding sites, accounting for the endothermic and exothermic heat reactions with the respective binding stoichiometries of 0.6 ± 2.4 and 2.0 ± 0.1 for YiiP, 0.6 ± 1.8 and 1.9 ± 0.1 for YiiPD157C, and 0.7 ± 3.1 and 1.1 ± 0.1 for YiiPD157A (TABLE ONE). Compared with YiiP, YiiPD157C appeared to retain all Zn2+-binding sites, whereas YiiPD157A was short of one exothermic site. The presence of multiple heat transitions precluded fitting of Zn2+ binding isotherms with certainty, as indicated by significant fitting errors. Thus a quantitative comparison of Zn2+ binding parameters was not amenable. Nevertheless, it was evident that a Zn2+ exothermic binding site was disrupted in YiiPD157A, whereas the same site remained intact in YiiPD157C. Furthermore, multiple transitions observed in the YiiPD157A binding isotherm indicated the presence of at least two additional Zn2+-binding sites after disruption of the Asp-157 site. In corroboration of the effects of Asp-157 mutations on Zn2+ binding, the rate of Zn2+ transport was unchanged with k3 values of 34 ± 5 and 33 ± 3 s–1 for YiiP and YiiPD157C, respectively, making a sharp contrast to YiiPD157A responses that were reduced to the background level (Fig. 2B). The Km values estimated from three experiments were 310 ± 32 and 358 ± 36 μm for YiiP and YiiPD157C, respectively, indicating no significant change in Zn2+ binding. Topological Mapping of Asp-157—A mechanistic understanding of the functional role of Asp-157 depends heavily on the ability of mapping it to a reliable topology model. The membrane topology of any CDF transporter has not yet been determined experimentally, but six segments of hydrophobic residues are suggested by YiiP hydropathy analysis. To determine whether each of these hydrophobic segments actually traversed the membrane and, if so, to determine their membrane spanning polarity, we introduced a series of cysteine substitution mutations, each located at the beginning or end of a hydrophobic segment. When intact cells were exposed to an impermeant thiol-specific probe, the probe accessibility to a reporter cysteine residue could indicate its extracellular or intracellular location. Two maleimide derivatives, FM and MPB, were used in this study. The maleimide group in FM is directly attached to a bulky and charged fluorescein moiety, and the maleimide in MPB is tethered to its biotin moiety through a linear polyethylene oxide chain (Fig. 3A). The bulkiness and the hydrophilic nature of both maleimide derivatives make them impermeant to the cytoplasmic membrane (21Fann M.C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33735-33740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). YiiP contains two native cysteine residues at positions 127 and 287. FM or MPB labeling to Cys-127 was not detected when YiiPC287S was exposed to 1 mm FM or MPB, even in the presence of 10% SDS (Fig. 3B). Thus a panel of single cysteine substitution mutants was constructed on the YiiPC287S background. Only one reactive cysteine residue is present in each of the following YiiP variants at a position as numbered: S10C/C287S, S36C/C287S, N70C/C287S, S107C/C287S, S144C/C287S, R177C/C287S, Cys-287 (equivalent to wild type YiiP). All these mutants were found to be fully functional by stopped-flow analysis, thereby ascertaining the structural and functional relevance of the topological mapping. MPB labeling was carried out with intact cells, from which MPB-treated YiiP variants were purified, and then exposed to FM in 10% SDS. The resultant MPB-FM doubly treated YiiP variants were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel for transillumination of FM labeling and then Western blot detection of MPB labeling. As shown in Fig. 3C, Western blots revealed a strong protein band in lane 1 for S36C, S107C, and R177C (top panel) but no detectable signal for S10C, N70C, S144C, and Cys-287 (bottom panel). The MPB reactivities in the former three positions and the lack of MPB reactivity in the latter four positions mirrored the pattern of FM fluorescence labeling, showing a background level of fluorescence in Fig. 3C, lane 1, for S36C, S107C, and R177C, as opposed to an intense fluorescence signal in lane 1 for S10C, N70C, S144C, and Cys-287. Because MPB labeling was directed to cysteine residues on the extracellular surface, whereas FM labeling was directed to any cysteine residue that su"

Although select TGFβ/BMP/GDF proteins were found to interact with type II and type I serine/threonine receptors to activate downstream Smad and other proteins, the receptors and signaling pathways for one-third of these TGFβ/BMP/GDF paralogs are still unclear. Based on a genomic analysis of the entire repertoire of TGFβ/BMP/GDF ligands and serine/threonine kinase receptors, we tested the ability of three orphan BMP/GDF ligands to activate a limited number of phylogenetically related receptors. We characterized the dimeric nature of recombinant GDF6 (also known as BMP13), GDF7 (also known as BMP12), and BMP10. We demonstrated their bioactivities based on the activation of Smad1/5/8-, but not Smad2/3-, responsive promoter constructs in the MC3T3 cell line. Furthermore, we showed their ability to induce the phosphorylation of Smad1, but not Smad2, in these cells. In COS7 cells transfected with the seven known type I receptors, overexpression of ALK3 or ALK6 conferred ligand signaling by GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. In contrast, transfection of MC3T3 cells with ALK3 small hairpin RNA suppressed Smad signaling induced by all three ligands. Based on the coevolution of ligands and receptors, we also tested the role of BMPRII and ActRIIA as the type II receptor candidates for the three orphan ligands. We found that transfection of small hairpin RNA for BMPRII and ActRIIA in MC3T3 cells suppressed the signaling of GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. Thus, the present approach provides a genomic paradigm for matching paralogous polypeptide ligands with a limited number of evolutionarily related receptors capable of activating specific downstream Smad proteins.

These polypeptide ligands regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis that are essential for embryonic development, organogenesis, bone formation, reproduction, and other physiological processes (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Homo- or heterodimeric TGFβ family ligands initiate signaling by assembling type II and type I serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes. After ligand binding, the type II receptors phosphorylate the type I receptors, which activate downstream Smad transcription factors (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). In the human genome, there are only five type II receptors, including TGFRII for TGFβ, ActRIIA and ActRIIB for activins and BMPs, BMPRII for several BMPs, and AMHRII for AMH (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are seven type I receptors designated as activin receptor-like kinases (ALKs) (3ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Franzen P. Schulz P. Saras J. Toyoshima H. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2879-2887PubMed Google Scholar). They include the type I receptors for TGFβ (ALK5 and ALK1), activins (ALK4), several BMPs/GDFs (ALK3, ALK6, and ALK2), and nodal (ALK7) (2Massague J. Annu. Rev.

After ligand binding, activation of the type I receptors initiates two distinct downstream Smad-signaling pathways; ALK1–3 and -6 receptors stimulate the Smad1/5/8 pathway (6Kretzschmar M.

Once stimulated through phosphorylation, these receptor-activated Smads form heterodimeric complexes with the common Smad4. The resulting complexes, in turn, translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Although the signaling pathways for many TGFβ/BMP/GDF proteins have been characterized, the receptors and downstream Smad proteins for approximately one-third of the TGFβ/BMP/GDF paralogs are still unclear. Based on a genomic analysis of the entire repertoire of TGFβ/BMP/GDF ligands and serine/threonine kinase receptors, we selected three ligands, GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10, as prototypic orphan ligands and predicted their type I and type II receptors. GDF6, also known as BMP13, is involved in joint and cartilage formation (10Storm E.E. Huynh T.V. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Kingsley D.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1994; 368: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). GDF7, also known as BMP12, is important for the development of interneurons, sensory neurons, and seminal vesicles (11Lee K.J.

We tested the ability of these “orphan” ligands to interact with a limited number of phylogenetically related receptors to initiate Smad signaling. We found that all three ligands activated a BMP-responsive promoter reporter (BRE) in the MC3T3 cell line. Following overexpression of all seven ALK proteins in the minimally responsive COS7 cells, we identified ALK3 and ALK6 as candidate type I receptors for GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10. The essential roles of the ALK3 proteins and two type II receptors (BMPRII and ActRIIA) were demonstrated by using an RNA interference approach. Phylogenetic Analysis—Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on multiple sequence alignment using the ClusterW algorithm (www.ch.embnet.org/software/ClustalW.html) and TreeView drawing software (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). For ligand analyses, the C-terminal regions containing the cystine knot starting from the first conserved cysteine residue were used.

Anti-His monoclonal antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase) was obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Generation of Recombinant Human BMP10—Human BMP10 cDNA was amplified from the human heart Marathon-Ready cDNA library (Clontech) using specific primers (forward, 5′-TTAGCGGCCGCATGGGCTCTCTGGTCCTGACACTGT-3′; Reverse, 5′-TTATCTAGACTATCTACAGCCACATTCGGAGACG-3′) and Turbo Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Fidelity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing after subcloning the cDNA into the expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). To facilitate purification, the BMP10 construct was tagged with a polyhistidine tag (His6) at the N terminus. Recombinant BMP10 proteins were generated from 293T cells transfected with expression plasmids using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Clonal cell lines stably expressing recombinant proteins were selected under 500 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and maintained in 200 μg/ml Zeocin. After 3 days of serum-free culture, the conditioned media were harvested, adjusted to 20 mm imidazole, and incubated with metal-chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The bound proteins were eluted with the wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Protein purity and biochemical characteristics were analyzed after electrophoresis using a 12% SDS-PAGE. Characterization of Recombinant GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10—Recombinant proteins treated under nonreducing or reducing conditions (5% β-mercaptoethanol) were separated on 4–20 (GDF6 and GDF7) or 12% (BMP10) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). To remove N-linked carbohydrate side chains, conditioned media containing BMP10 were diluted in the deglycosylation buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated with 7.7 international milliunits of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2 h. Immunoblots were performed using anti-GDF6 (1 μg/ml), anti-GDF7 (0.1 μg/ml), or anti-His (1:600 dilution) monoclonal antibodies. Signals were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).

The pcDNA3 expression plasmids encoding ALK1, ALK2, ALK3, ALK5, ALK6, ALK7, Smad6, and Smad7 were from Dr. P. Ten Dijke (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Small Hairpin RNA Plasmid Construction—The pSilencer 2.0-U6 plasmid (Ambion, Austin, TX) containing the human U6 RNA polymerase III promoter was used to construct the shRNA-encoding plasmids targeting BMPRII, ActRIIA, or ALK6 mRNAs. They were generated by inserting annealed oligonucleotides (TABLE ONE) into the pSilencer 2.0-U6 plasmid between the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites using the T4 DNA ligase (Roche Diagnostics). Each oligonucleotide contained the target sequences, the restriction sites at both ends, the linker sequences, and a stretch of T or A residues as the polymerase III terminator. The 21-nucleotide target sequences were defined from the mouse cDNA sequences by using the small interfering RNA Target Finder (Ambion). After synthesis, the sense and antisense oligonucleotides were annealed at 90 °C for 3 min and 37 °C for 1 h. In addition, the plasmid encoding mouse ALK3 shRNA was purchased from OpenBiosystems (Huntsville, AL). A single oligonucleotide (TABLE ONE), containing the target sequences, was used as the PCR template. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned between the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the pSHAG-MAGIC2 vector.TABLE ONESequences of shRNAs for different type I and type II receptorsPlasmidTargetOligonucleotide sequences (5′ → 3′)shBMPRIIBMPRII (NM_007561) 1583-1603 AACGCAACCTGTCACATAATAS, gatccGCGCAACCTGTCACATAATActcaagagaTATTATGTGACAGGTTGCGTTTTTTGGAAAAS, agcttTTCCAAAAAACGCAACCTGTCACATAATAtctcttgagTATTATGTGACAGGTTGCGCGshActRIIAActRIIA (NM_007396) 603-623 AAGATTTGGTTGTGTCTGGAAS, gatccGATTTGGTTGTGTCTGGAAttcaagagaTTCCAGACACAACCAAATCTTTTTTGGAAAAS, agcttTTCCAAAAAAGATTTGGTTGTGTCTGGAAtctcttgaaTTCCAGACACAACCAAATCGshControl (shCt)None AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT (17)5}5}5}S, gatccGTTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTttcaagagaACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAATTTTTTGGAAAAS, agcttTTCCAAAAAATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGTtctcttgaaACGTGACACGTTCGGAGAACGshALK3ALK3 (NM_009758) 211-231 GCTATTAATAACACATGCATATGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGCGCTATTAATAACACATGCATAtagtgaagccacagatgtaTATGCATGTGTTATTAATAGCATGCCTACTGCCTCGGA Open table in a new tab Cell Lines and Transfection—MC3T3 and P19 cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS, together with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (PSG). COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and PSG. MC3T3 and COS7 cells were seeded at 90% confluency in 24-well plates and transiently transfected in Opti-MEM for 4 h with 1 μg (COS7 cells) or 300 ng (MC3T3 cells) of plasmid DNA per well using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Fifty ng of the pCMV-β-galactosidase vector was routinely cotransfected to monitor transfection efficiency. After transfection, cells were treated with the appropriate ligands. To monitor luciferase activities, lysis buffer (200 μl) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) was added to each well, and 30 μl of the supernatant was used for luciferase determination using a luminometer (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of the cell lysate were also used to measure β-galactosidase activities. The reporter activity is expressed as the ratio of relative light unit/β-galactosidase activity. Data are the mean ± S.E. of triplicates from representative experiments. Western Blotting Analysis of Smad Proteins—To investigate Smad activation by GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10, MC3T3 cells (180,000 cells/well) were cultured overnight in 12-well plates in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS and starved for 3 h in serum-free media to minimize basal Smad activity. MC3T3 cells were treated with different hormones for 30 min and washed once on ice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline before cell lysis in the loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were gently sonicated on ice for 15 s with an MSE sonicator (Sanyo Corp., Osaka, Japan) and boiled for 3 min. Cellular proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto Hybond-electrochemiluminescence (for Smad2 experiments) and Hybond-P membranes (for Smad1 experiments) (Amersham Biosciences). For the detection of phosphorylated Smads, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 5% fat-free dry milk. After blocking of nonspecific binding, membranes were incubated with antiphospho-Smad1 or antiphospho-Smad2 antibodies diluted at 1:5,000 at 4 °C overnight. The secondary anti-rabbit antibodies were used following manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Receptors Expression Profiles Based on RT-PCR and Real-time PCR—Messenger RNAs were extracted from MC3T3, P19, and COS cell lines using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized by using reverse transcriptase (Clontech). Traditional PCR was carried out using the Advantage cDNA polymerase kit (Clontech), and real-time PCR was performed using SmartCycler (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primers used for individual genes are listed in TABLE TWO. To determine the copy number of target transcripts, ALK3, ALK6, BMPRII, and ActRIIA cDNAs were used to generate calibration curves by plotting the threshold cycle (Ct) versus the known copy number for each plasmid template. The copy numbers for target samples were determined according to the calibration curve.TABLE TWOPrimers and probes for RT-PCR analyses of type I and type II receptor transcripts from different speciesGenesGenBank™ accession no.Primers forward (5′-3′)Primers reverse (5′-3′)Probes (5′FAM—TAMRA3′)MouseALK3NM_009758CCTGTTGTTATAGGTCCGTTCTTAGCTGGAGAAGATGATCATAGCAATCCGATGGCTGGTTGTGCTCATTCTATGACTTCCTGAAATGTGCTGTCAGCCATGATGTAGGGCTGALK6NM_007560GGAAGACTCAGTCAACAATATCTGCCTAGTCCTAGACATCCAGAGGTGACAGAAGAAGATGACTCTGGAATGCCTGGAAGATCAATTGAATGCTGCACAGGAACCAGCTGGCTTCCTCBMPRIINM_007561AGCTGACAGAAGAAGACTTGGAGCAAGCTAGAACTGGTACTGCTCATCTCATGGAGCATTCTCTGAAGCAGActRIIANM_007396GTTGAACCTTGCTATGGTGATAAAATCAGTCCTGTCATAGCAGTTGAGTGAAGCAAGGTTGTTGGCTGGAHumanALK1NM_000020CTGCAACCACAACGTGTCGAGCCACAGCTGCGTGCTCGAGALK2NM_001105GACCACTGTGAAGGCCAGCAGTGCACTTCCTGATGTACACGAALK3NM_004329CTATGACTTCCTGAAATGTGCTGTCAGCCATGATGTAGGGCTGALK4NM_004302GTCCAGCGCACAGTGGCCCGTGGACTCCTCCAGAATTGCATCALK5NM_004612ACTACAACATATTGCTGCAATCAGCATGCTCATGATAATCTGACACALK6NM_001203GAAGATCAATTGAATGCTGCACAGGAACCAGCTGGCTTCCTCALK7NM_145259GCTTGATGATACAATGCACTCACGCATTATTCMonkey β-actinXM_511735ATCATGAAGTGTGACGTGGACATGATGATCTTGATCTTCATGGTGCT Open table in a new tab Phylogenetic Relationship of TGFβ Family Ligands and Their Corresponding Signaling Pathways—The TGFβ superfamily includes 33 related ligands, but there are only 5 type II and 7 type I serine/threonine kinase receptors in the human genome (1Chang H. Brown C.W. Matzuk M.M. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 787-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 19Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although approximately one-third of these ligands are still orphans without known receptors and downstream signaling pathways, cognate receptors and downstream Smads for the remaining ligands have been characterized (Fig. 1). After interacting with type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors, the ligands activate two major pathways characterized by the activation of two different groups of intracellular Smad proteins. Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are phosphorylated by the type I receptors ALK1–3 or -6, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are activated by the receptors ALK4, -5, or -7 (6Kretzschmar M. Massague J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

It is apparent that combinatorial uses of a limited number of type I and type II receptors led to differential activation by the large number of ligands. Because many of the BMP and GDF proteins are still orphan ligands, we hypothesized that these ligands are likely to interact with the limited number of receptors, and phylogenetically related ligands are likely to interact with the same receptors. We selected GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10 as prototypic orphan ligands, and we investigated their signaling pathways. Based on the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1), the three orphan ligands are closely related to BMP2 and GDF5. Thus, they could activate the Smad1/5/8 pathway through interactions with the type I receptors ALK3 and ALK6 and the type II receptors BMPRII and ActRIIA. Characterization of Recombinant GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10—Members of the TGFβ superfamily are synthesized as large precursor molecules that are cleaved proteolytically at an RXXR site to release a C-terminal mature peptide of 110–140 amino acids in length (2Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar, 20Kingsley D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). This region shares conserved cysteine residues involved in the cystine knot conformation (21Vitt U.A. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In many cases, an extra cysteine residue is engaged in intermolecular disulfide bond formation necessary for the assembly of biologically active dimers. We analyzed the biochemical properties of recombinant GDF6 and GDF7 under both reducing and nonreducing conditions using anti-GDF6 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–2) and anti-GDF7 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–4) antibodies. Under reducing conditions, a band of 13 kDa likely represented the GDF6 monomer (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 2A, lane 1), an ∼30-kDa band and a 13-kDa band likely represented GDF6 dimers and monomers, respectively. For GDF7, distinct dimer and monomer bands of 32 (Fig. 2A, lane 3) and 16 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 4) were found under nonreduced and reduced conditions, respectively. These data suggested that both GDF6 and GDF7 formed disulfide-linked homodimers. To generate recombinant BMP10, we first performed RT-PCR using a heart cDNA library to obtain the full-length human BMP10 cDNA. Human 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors containing the BMP10 cDNA tagged at its N terminus with a polyhistidine epitope His6. Following selection of permanent clones, cell lines were cultured under serum-free conditions to obtain conditioned media. Recombinant BMP10 was purified using metal chelate chromatography based on the presence of the His6 tag. Following Coomassie Blue staining, three distinct bands were found under nonreducing conditions. The 25-kDa band represented the dimer form, and the 64- and 120-kDa bands likely represented the unprocessed monomers and dimers, respectively (Fig. 2B, lane 1). These unprocessed BMP10 forms contained the uncleaved large prodomain in addition to the C-terminal mature region. Under reducing conditions, BMP10 migrated as a 12-kDa band representing the monomer form and a 60-kDa band corresponding to the unprocessed monomer (Fig. 2B, lane 2). A third weak band of 48 kDa could represent a shorter unprocessed form of BMP10 generated after cleavage of the N-terminal region of the prodomain (Fig. 2B, lane 2). In addition, under reducing conditions, the anti-His6 antibody revealed the same three bands representing the monomer (12 kDa) and the unprocessed monomer forms of 60 and 48 kDa (Fig. 2B, lane 4). After treatment with PNGase F to remove N-linked carbohydrate chains, the 60- and 48-kDa unprocessed forms of BMP10 migrated faster (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5), suggesting that the N-glycosylation sites are located in the prodomain. These data suggested that the recombinant BMP10 was secreted as an N-glycosylated homodimeric proform, and after processing, the mature protein formed nonglycosylated homodimers. Treatment with GDF6, GDF7, or BMP10 Activates the Smad1/5/8 Pathway in MC3T3 Cells—We hypothesized that GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10 shares downstream signaling molecules with other TGFβ ligands. We took advantage of the availability of different promoter-luciferase constructs for these hormones to elucidate their signaling pathways. The BRE promoter is known to be activated by several BMPs mediated by Smad1/5/8, whereas the CAGA promoter is activated by TGFβ/activin mediated by Smad2 and Smad3 (15Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J.

We tested the responses of the two reporter constructs in several cell lines transfected with these plasmids following treatment with the three orphan ligands. Although most cell lines tested did not respond to the ligand stimulation (data not shown), treatment of the MC3T3 cells with GDF6, GDF7, or BMP10 stimulated the luciferase reporter driven by the BRE promoter (Fig. 3A). Consistent with earlier findings (15Korchynskyi O. ten Dijke P. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4653-4663Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the BRE promoter was activated by BMP2 and BMP7. Although TGF-β was ineffective in activating the BRE promoter (Fig. 3A), treatment with TGF-β stimulated the reporter driven by the CAGA promoter (Fig. 3B) (16Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment with GDF6, GDF7, or BMP10 did not activate the CAGA promoter (Fig. 3B). Similarly, treatment with BMP2 or BMP7 did not stimulate the CAGA promoter (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the stimulatory effects of GDF6, GDF7, or BMP10 on the BRE promoter were found to be dose-dependent (Fig. 3C). The ability of GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10 to activate the Smad 1/5/8 pathway was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using specific antibodies against phospho-Smad1 or phospho-Smad2. As shown in Fig. 3D, treatment with GDF6, GDF7, or BMP10, similar to BMP2, induced the phosphorylation of Smad1 in MC3T3 cells. In contrast, they were ineffective in inducing phospho-Smad2 in the same cells. These findings suggest that MC3T3, a mouse pre-osteoblast cell line derived from neonatal mouse calvaria (23Wang D. Christensen K. Chawla K. Xiao G. Krebsbach P.H. Franceschi R.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), likely expresses receptors necessary for GDF6, GDF7, and BMP10 signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2015721248,"Since its reported discovery in 1994, maspin (mammary serine protease inhibitor) has been characterized as a class II tumor suppressor by its ability to promote apoptosis and inhibit cell invasion. Maspin is highly expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but reduced or absent in aggressive breast carcinomas. However, despite efforts to characterize the mechanism(s) by which maspin functions as a tumor suppressor, its molecular characterization has remained somewhat elusive. Therefore, in an attempt to identify maspin-interacting proteins and thereby gain insight into the functional pathways of maspin, we employed a maspin-baited yeast two-hybrid system and subsequently identified Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) as a maspin-binding protein. IRF6 belongs to the IRF family of transcription factors, which is best known for its regulation of interferon and interferon-inducible genes following a pathogenic stimulus. Although many of the IRF family members have been well characterized, IRF6 remains poorly understood. We report that IRF6 is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells and that it directly associates with maspin in a yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. The interaction occurs via the conserved IRF protein association domain and is regulated by phosphorylation of IRF6. We have shown that, similar to maspin, IRF6 expression is inversely correlated with breast cancer invasiveness. We further demonstrated that the transient re-expression of IRF6 in breast cancer cells results in an increase of N-cadherin and a redistribution of vimentin commensurate with changes in cell morphology, suggestive of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition event. Concomitantly, we showed that maspin acts as a negative regulator of this process. These findings help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of maspin and suggest an interactive role between maspin and IRF6 in regulating cellular phenotype, the loss of which can lead to neoplastic transformation.

(mammary serine protease inhibitor, SerpinB5) was first isolated by subtractive hybridization and differential display as a protein that is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells but reduced or absent in breast carcinomas (1Zou Z.

Since its initial discovery, maspin has been shown to inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in breast cancer cells (2Sheng S. Carey J. Seftor E. Dias L. Hendrix M.J.C. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11669-11674Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Further studies implicate maspin as an angiogenesis inhibitor by its ability to block neovascularization and reduce tumor-associated microvessels and also demonstrate a role for maspin in the induction of apoptosis of tumor cells (3Zhang M. Volpert O. Shi Y.H. Bouck N. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 196-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 4Jiang N. Meng Y. Zhang S. Mensah-Osman E. Sheng S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In addition, the overexpression of maspin in transgenic mice disrupts normal mammary gland development by increasing apoptosis and disrupting cell differentiation (5Zhang M. Magit D. Botteri F. Shi H.Y. He K. Li M. Furth P. Sager R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 278-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite the characterization of maspin as a tumor suppressor, the molecular mechanisms underlying maspin function are complex and remain predominantly unknown. Therefore, in an effort to decipher the molecular mechanisms of maspin, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system, in which we expressed full-length maspin as bait, to identify maspin-binding proteins. This approach led to the identification of Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) as a possible maspin-binding protein. IRF6 belongs to the nine-member Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) family of transcription factors. IRFs are characterized by two conserved functional domains, namely a distinctive N-terminal DNA binding domain and a protein interaction domain. The protein interaction domain, termed the IRF association domain (IAD), is located near the C-terminal end of the protein. It is thought that protein-protein interactions involving the IAD, including homo- and heterodimerization among other IRF family members, are mediated through phosphorylation of one or multiple serine residues present within the serine-rich region near the C terminus, thus allowing interaction with other proteins (6Mori M.

For several IRFs, this activation step is initiated by various pathogenic stimuli that induce IRF phosphorylation, leading to dimerization and subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where IRFs function to modulate the activation of type I interferons (10Barnes B.J.

Additionally, apart from their role in host defense, IRFs have been linked to the cellular processes of apoptosis, tumor suppression, and embryonic development (12Barnes B.J. Kellum M.J. Pinder K.E.

Although sequence alignment suggests that IRF6 possesses the conserved functional domains of the IRF family, there is no evidence to suggest that IRF6 functions in a similar manner to that of other IRFs nor has the initiating signal for IRF6 activation yet been determined. Here, we have demonstrated that IRF6 is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells and that it interacts with maspin. IRF6 expression, similar to that of maspin, is reduced or lost as cells acquire a neoplastic state and progress toward a metastatic phenotype. We have also provided evidence implicating IRF6 in the regulation of cell differentiation through alterations in N-cadherin and vimentin, important phenotype markers associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Importantly, changes induced by the re-expression of IRF6 are mitigated by the presence of maspin, all of which furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of maspin. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Transfection—Normal, primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC 1331) were purchased from BioWhittaker, Inc. (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in defined mammary epithelial cell basal medium provided by the company. The 1436N1 cell line, an HPV16E6 immortalized normal mammary epithelial cell line, was a gift from Dr. Shijie Sheng, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI and was maintained in D-complete medium (1:1 α-minimal essential medium and HAM F-12 supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 50 μm ascorbic acid, and Mito+ with gentamicin. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T47-D, MDA-MB-231, and HS578T were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamicin. IRF6 transfection of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231 green fluorescent protein-maspin was performed using the pacAd5CMV construct developed at the University of Iowa DNA vector core (supplied at 1011 particles/ml) at varying multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 50 to 250. Cells were treated in RPMI containing 1% serum with no antibiotic for 2 h, following which RPMI complete medium was added to the cells. Transfection efficiency was verified by Western blot analysis of transfected cells. All experiments were performed at 7 days post-transfection. Semiquantitative PCR and Real-time PCR—Semiquantitative and real-time PCR were performed using standard protocols (18Kirschmann D.A. Seftor E.A. Fong S.F.T. Nieva D.R.C. Sullivan C.M. Edwards E.M. Sommer P. Csiszar K. Hendrix M.J.C.

Primers for GAPDH were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). PCR was performed for 27 cycles with a melting temperature of 60 °C. For maspin and GAPDH, primers were reported previously. For real-time PCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Advantage PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Real-time PCR was performed on a 7500 Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan ® gene expression human primer/probe sets for the genes IRF6 (Hs00196213_m1) and N-cadherin (Hs00170423_m1) (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, 5 μl of cDNA, 1.25 μl of 20× Gene Expression Assay Mix, and 12.5 μl of 2× TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix in a total of 25 μl were amplified with the following thermocycler protocol: 1 cycle at 50 °C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s/60 °C for 1 min. All data were analyzed with Sequence Detection software (version 1.2.3; Applied Biosystems). The expression of each target gene was normalized to an endogenous control gene (GAPDH, 4333764F). Cellular Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Cytosolic fractionation of cell lysate was performed similar to that previously described (19Khalkhali-Ellis Z. Christian A.L. Kirschmann D.A. Edwards E.M. Rezaie-Thompson M. Vasef M.A. Gruman L.M. Seftor R.E. Norwood L.E. Hendrix M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in cold PBS and lysed in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm NaF plus protease inhibitor). Cells were scraped, and the slurry was incubated on ice for 30 min. Cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following the spin, the cytoplasmic fraction was removed and the pellet was washed three times in Buffer A. The remaining pellet was then lysed with Buffer B (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol plus protease inhibitors mentioned in Buffer A), incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min to collect the nuclear fraction. Equal amounts of cellular protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% resolving gel) and Western blot analysis using specific antibody to maspin (1:1000, monoclonal; BD Biosciences) or IRF6 (1:1000). IRF6 polyclonal rabbit antibody was custom ordered from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) using the peptides EDELEQSQHHVPIQDTFPF (amino acids 147-165) and SPEASWPKTEPLEMEV (amino acids 187-102). The antibody was affinity purified, and its specificity was evaluated using the two blocking peptides (Fig. 2a). Immunofluorescence—1436N1 mammary epithelial cells were seeded onto a Falcon 8-well CultureSlide (BD Biosciences) and grown to 70% confluency. Cells were fixed and stained as described previously (19Khalkhali-Ellis Z. Christian A.L. Kirschmann D.A. Edwards E.M. Rezaie-Thompson M. Vasef M.A. Gruman L.M. Seftor R.E. Norwood L.E. Hendrix M.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed 3× in PBS and fixed in 100% ice-cold methanol for 5 min. Following fixation, cells were again washed 3× in PBS and blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibody was then added and incubated for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were washed 3× in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Cells were then washed 3× in PBS and mounted onto coverslips with gelvatol. Primary antibody for IRF6 was used at 1:750 and for maspin at 1:200. Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody was used at 1:200 and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at 1:200 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Immunostaining for N-cadherin and vimentin was performed on MDA-MB-231neo and MDA-MB-231maspin cells 7 days post-infection with IRF6-containing adenovirus. Monoclonal antibody to N-cadherin (BD Biosciences) was used at 1:400, and monoclonal vimentin antibody (V-9 conjugated with Texas Red-X) was used at 1:1000 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Phosphatase Treatment—50 μg of total cell lysate from HMEC 1331 cells was treated with 0.4 units of lambda-phosphatase (Sigma) with the supplied 10× buffer and MnCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. The sample was then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody against IRF6. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—500 μg of protein from cytosolic fraction of 1436N1 cell lysate was precleared with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). The lysate was then incubated with IRF6 polyclonal antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Immune complex was precipitated by the addition of Protein A-Sepharose (1 h at room temperature), washed 3× in PBS, and eluted using 2× SDS reducing buffer (sample buffer) for 5 min at room temperature. Elutions were assessed using Western blot on 10% acrylamide gels. For phosphatase-treated samples, cell lysate was treated with 2 units of lambda-phosphatase for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the primary antibody. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed using the Matchmaker™ Gal4 Two-hybrid System 3 from Clontech. We cloned the full-length maspin coding sequence into pGBKT7 to generate the pGBKT7-maspin bait plasmid in which maspin is fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. The human mammary gland Matchmaker™ cDNA library was expressed in the vector pGADT7 as prey. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Selection was performed on S.D.:-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactoside as a visual selection marker. Plasmids were isolated from yeast using a standard smash-and-grab protocol with glass beads (425-500 microns, acid-washed; Sigma). Sequencing of the prey plasmids was performed at the University of Iowa DNA Sequencing Facility. For co-transformation of IRF6 deletion mutant constructs, competent AH109 yeast was prepared using a standard lithium acetate protocol. In brief, yeast was suspended in TE/LiAc (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m lithium acetate, pH 7.5). Bait and prey plasmids were added to competent cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol (40%), 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m lithium acetate, and subjected to heat shock for 15 min at 42 °C. Herring testis DNA was used as a carrier. Successful co-transformation was selected with S.D.:-Leu/-Trp and bait-prey interactions were assayed on S.D.:-Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His quadruple knockout medium. All medium supplements were obtained from Clontech. Tissue Specimens and Immunohistochemistry—Archival tissue from patients with no prior drug treatment was obtained from the Department of Pathology at The University of Iowa and the Department of Pathology at Northwestern University, Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, and were used in compliance with requirements of the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects. Tissue specimens were sectioned at 4 μm, deparaffinized, and subjected to a water bath antigen-recovery protocol using citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Maspin and IRF6 expression were determined on the Dako Autostainer using the Vectastain universal Elite ABC Peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Antibody to maspin was used at a 1:200 dilution as previously described (20Hendrix M.J.C. Seftor E.A. Seftor R.E.B. Trevor K.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 483-493PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody to IRF6 was used at a 1:1200 dilution. Expression was determined by semiquantitative assessment of the stained cells and the staining intensity by diaminobenzidine. All the samples were reviewed by a board-certified pathologist (Michael R. Pins) who was blinded to the clinical outcome of these patients until the scoring had been completed. An experimental flow chart outlining the design of the study is available in the supplemental data. Yeast Two-hybrid and in Vitro Verification of Maspin-IRF6 Interaction—Because the tumor suppressive functions of maspin were first identified in mammary epithelial cells, we utilized a cDNA library derived from normal human mammary epithelial cells in a maspin-baited yeast two-hybrid assay. Evaluation of the resultant clones revealed IRF6 as a putative maspin-binding protein, with the amino acid sequence from residues 139 to 334 spanning almost the entire IRF6 proline-rich region and two-thirds of the IAD domain identified as the interaction site (highlighted in the box, Fig. 1). Following the identification of IRF6 as a possible target for maspin interaction, we confirmed the presence of endogenous IRF6 in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEpC) by semiquantitative PCR and Western blot and verified the interaction between maspin and IRF6 in vitro through co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2). Post-nuclear cytosolic fractions from 1436N1 cells and Ad5 IRF6-infected MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated by Western blot before and after preincubation of the antibody with blocking peptides (Fig. 2a) to demonstrate the specificity of the IRF6 antibody. Both mRNA (Fig. 2b) and protein levels (Fig. 2c) of endogenous IRF6 are clearly demonstrated in HMEpC and the immortalized mammary epithelial cell line 1436N1. Importantly, cell lysates used in the Western blot analysis represent the post-nuclear cytosolic fraction, where both IRF6 and maspin primarily reside. Under the experimental conditions used, no IRF6 was detected in the nuclear fraction (see supplemental Fig. S2). This is supported by confocal microscopy, which demonstrates the cellular localization of these proteins in the cytoplasmic compartment of cultured mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 2d). When examined by Western blot, IRF6 appears as a doublet with molecular masses of ∼59 and ∼63 kDa. Because it is known that phosphorylation of IRFs is important for IRF activation, we tested whether the IRF6 doublet represents different phosphorylation states of IRF6 in HMEpCs. Treatment of HMEpC cell lysate with the nonspecific lambda-phosphatase resulted in the disappearance of the upper band, whereas the intensity of the lower band increased, indicating that the upper band represents a phosphorylated form of IRF6 (Fig. 3a). To further confirm the phosphorylation status of IRF6 and identify the target amino acid, we tested immunoprecipitated IRF6 with commercially available antibodies to phosphoserine, threonine, and tyrosine. We were unable to confirm the phosphorylation status using this approach, and because no phospho-specific antibody to IRF6 is yet available, further work is required to resolve this important point. To verify the maspin-IRF6 interaction in cell culture, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay utilizing the cytosolic fraction from 1436N1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3b, immunoprecipitation with anti-IRF6 antibody precipitated endogenous IRF6 and co-precipitated maspin, indicative of an interaction between these two proteins in cultured mammary epithelial cells. It is important to note that the amount of maspin interacting with IRF6 under these conditions represents a small fraction of the total maspin found in the cells, and further work must be done to quantify the stoichiometric ratios of this protein interaction. To examine the role of IRF6 phosphorylation in regulating the maspin-IRF6 interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation with cell lysate pretreated with lambda-phosphatase (Fig. 3b). This led to a significant decrease in the amount of maspin interacting with IRF6, indicating a role for phosphorylation in the regulation of the maspin-IRF6 interaction. These observations were further strengthened by IRF6 protein truncation analysis (Fig. 3c). The IRF family shares at least two common domains, namely an N-terminal DNA binding domain and a protein association domain termed the IRF association domain (IAD). Because the IAD is the primary site of protein interaction among the IRFs, we hypothesized that the IAD would be necessary for an interaction with maspin. To test this, we constructed a series of IRF6 deletion mutant constructs and co-expressed these constructs with the maspin-bait vector in a yeast two-hybrid system to evaluate interaction efficiency. The results demonstrate that the IAD (exons 7-8) is both necessary and sufficient for growth on selective media, verifying the IRF6 IAD as the site of interaction with maspin. Importantly, the inclusion of exon 9 in the IRF6 vector was sufficient to effectively abrogate this growth response, indicating an inefficient maspin-IRF6 interaction when exon 9 is present. Maspin and IRF6 Expression in Breast Cancer—As we attempted to assess the biological relevance of the maspin-IRF6 interaction, we focused our studies on breast cancer, where the expression of maspin is inversely correlated with the advancement of tumor progression. In HMEpCs, maspin is present in high levels but dramatically reduced in non-aggressive mammary tumors and absent in a majority of highly invasive, metastatic breast carcinomas. Because of maspin's implications in breast cancer development and progression, we examined IRF6 expression as it relates to maspin expression in a series of neoplastic cell lines. Semiquantitative PCR analysis of the non-aggressive, poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47-D revealed a moderate reduction in IRF6 mRNA compared with HMEpC and 1436N1 (Fig. 4a). No IRF6 mRNA was detected in the highly invasive, metastatic cell lines MDA-MB-231 and HS578T, which mimics the expression pattern of maspin in these same cells. This IRF6 expression pattern was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot analysis, where the loss of IRF6 in both the poorly invasive and highly invasive cell lines is more pronounced (Fig. 4b). These data were confirmed by in situ immunohistochemistry of patient tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis of maspin and IRF6 in tissue samples from normal mammary gland, non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma revealed an expression pattern in situ similar to that seen in the cell lines tested), where non-invasive neoplastic cells demonstrated a modest reduction of IRF6 and the loss of both maspin and IRF6 coincided with the appearance of invasive cancer cells (Fig. 5 and TABLE ONE).FIGURE 5Immunohistochemical analysis of IRF6 and maspin in normal and neoplastic tissue sections.

At 7 days post-infection, an altered phenotype was noticeable in MB-231neo cells. However, no changes were seen in MB-231maspin cells following Ad5 IRF6 infection (Fig. 6, A-D). The presence of maspin and IRF6 was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy of the cells and real-time PCR, respectively (Figs. 6B and 7a).FIGURE 7Real-time PCR analysis demonstrating changes in N-cadherin expression following Ad5 IRF6 infection of MDA-MB-231 cells.

Real-time PCR analysis of transfected and non-transfected MB-231neo cells indicated an increase in the expression of N-cadherin (Fig. 7b.). This was further confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemical analysis of the fixed cells (Fig. 6, A and B). For vimentin, there was no significant change at the mRNA level, but at the protein level the presence of IRF6 exerted a change in the distribution of vimentin (Fig. 6, A and B). Notably, the alterations in N-cadherin and vimentin were not evident in the MB-231maspin cells infected with Ad5 IRF6 (Fig. 6, C and D). This study presents new findings from a yeast two-hybrid system in which we identified a novel interaction between the tumor suppressor maspin and IRF6, a member of the IRF transcription factor family. Our studies indicate that IRF6 is expressed in normal human mammary epithelial cells, and this interaction with maspin has been verified by co-immunoprecipitation. IRF6 is the least understood of the nine-member IRF family. Functions for this family of transcription factors have generally been associated with the induction and regulation of type I interferons and interferon-inducible genes following pathogenic insult but have also been linked to the cellular processes of growth co"

Expression of D117E ICAD, a mutant that is resistant to caspase cleavage at residue 117, prevented low molecular weight (LMW) DNA fragmentation, stage II nuclear morphology, and detection of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase staining. However, high molecular weight (HMW) DNA fragmentation and stage I nuclear morphology remained unaffected. On the other hand, expression of either D224E or wild type ICAD had no effect on DNA fragmentation or nuclear morphology. In addition, both HMW and LMW DNA degradation required functional executor caspases. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous AIF abolished type I nuclear morphology without any effect on HMW or LMW DNA fragmentation. Together, these results demonstrate that AIF is responsible for stage I nuclear morphology and suggest that HMW DNA degradation is a caspase-activated DNase and AIF-independent process.

DNA degradation is considered to be one of the defining hallmarks of apoptosis and is one of the first biochemical characteristics described for this type of cell death (1Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4152) Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation is usually a two-step process in which the DNA is first cleaved into 50- to 300-kb fragments, termed high molecular weight (HMW) 8The abbreviations used are: HMWhigh molecular weightLMWlow molecular weightTUNELterminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelingPBSphosphate-buffered salineAIFapoptosis-inducing factorCADcaspase-activated DNaseICADinhibitor of CADMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideSTPstaurosporinedsRNAdouble-stranded RNAZbenzyloxycarbonylFMKfluoromethyl ketoneCHEFclamped homogeneous electric fields electrophoresisQ-VD-OPhN-(2-quinolyl)valyl-aspartyl-(2,6-difluorophenoxy)methyl ketone. DNA fragmentation. Subsequently, DNA is degraded into smaller fragments of oligonucleosomal size, known as low molecular weight (LMW) DNA degradation or DNA ladder (2Lecoeur H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The early HMW degradation is associated with initial nuclear morphological changes characterized by a condensation of the chromatin around the nuclear membrane (stage I chromatin condensation or nuclear morphology). The later, LMW degradation coincides with a more advanced nuclear chromatin condensation into highly packed round masses (stage II chromatin condensation) (2Lecoeur H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 277: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although HMW DNA fragmentation usually precedes LMW DNA fragmentation, there are evidences indicating that apoptosis can proceed without LMW DNA degradation while still displaying the HMW (3Ucker D.S.

The execution of apoptotic cell death is governed by caspases, a family of cysteine proteases that, after activation by different pro-apoptotic stimuli, cleave target cell substrates (10Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 11Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Caspases induce DNA degradation through the activation of the specific nuclease, caspase-activated DNase (CAD) (12Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar), also known as caspase-activated nuclease (13Halenbeck R. MacDonald H. Roulston A. Chen T.T. Conroy L. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 537-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or DNA fragmentation factor 40 kDa (DFF40) (14Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). CAD is sufficient to induce both stage II chromatin condensation and LMW DNA degradation in isolated nuclei (14Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 15Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In growing cells, CAD remains inactive in the cytoplasm associated to the inhibitor of CAD (ICAD) (16Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar), also known as DNA fragmentation factor 45 kDa (DFF45) (17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). ICAD is encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs that generate long (ICAD-L) and short (ICAD-S) forms of ICAD. ICAD has dual functions, acting both as a CAD inhibitor and as a chaperone for CAD synthesis. Therefore, the expression of CAD in the absence of co-expressed ICAD results in the generation of inactive aggregates of CAD (18Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15740-15744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ICAD harbors two caspase recognition sites at Asp117 and Asp224. CAD release from ICAD inhibition is achieved by cleavage of ICAD at these Asp residues by caspase-3 (14Liu X. Li P. Widlak P. Zou H. Luo X. Garrard W.T. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8461-8466Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 17Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

CAD is the best characterized nuclease implicated in apoptosis, but its specific contribution to apoptotic DNA processing and nuclear morphological changes has not been completely elucidated. Most studies on the role of ICAD in both HMW and LMW DNA fragmentation have been performed in ICAD knock-out mice or by expressing caspase-resistant forms of ICAD. Because ICAD acts as a chaperone during CAD synthesis, ICAD knock-out mice also lack a functional CAD. From these studies, the functional consequences of ICAD deficiency (20Zhang J. Liu X. Scherer D.C. van Kaer L. Wang X. Xu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12480-12485Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Zhang J. Lee H. Lou D.W. Bovin G.P. Xu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have been attributed to the lack of active CAD, and do not show HMW or LMW DNA fragmentation, a result comparable to that obtained with a CAD-/- mice (22Kawane K. Fukuyama H. Yoshida H. Nagase H. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Okada K. Iida T. Nagata S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, human lymphoma cell lines overexpressing caspase-resistant ICAD also lack both LMW and HMW DNA fragmentation (23Sakahira H. Enari M. Ohsawa Y. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 543-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that CAD is the enzyme also responsible for both HMW and LMW DNA fragmentation. However, it cannot be discarded that ICAD might have additional functions independent of CAD, and therefore, the phenotype of ICAD-/- cells could be different from that of those expressing caspase-resistant ICAD. In that sense, other reports have shown that CAD is dispensable for apoptotic HMW DNA fragmentation. Samejima et al. (15Samejima K. Tone S. Kottke T.J. Enari M. Sakahira H. Cooke C.A. Durrieu F. Martins L.M. Nagata S. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the activity causing nuclear morphological apoptotic changes could be inhibited by caspase inhibitors but not by ICAD. More significantly, CAD-deficient chicken DT40 cells failed to undergo LMW degradation and stage II chromatin condensation but displayed normal HMW DNA degradation and stage I morphology. These data suggest that factors other than CAD might be involved (24Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45427-45432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In summary, these results provide evidence that CAD triggers LMW DNA fragmentation, although the role of CAD and ICAD in HMW fragmentation remains controversial (25Nagata S. Nagase H. Kawane K. Mukae N. Fukuyama H. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that endonucleases, other than CAD, could be responsible for HMW DNA fragmentation (24Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. J. Biol.

In the search for additional endonucleases that could be involved in DNA fragmentation, several molecules have been proposed. Among them, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) has been demonstrated to play a role in HMW DNA fragmentation (26Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar). AIF promotes caspase-independent HMW fragmentation and type I nuclear condensation when released from mitochondria by pro-apoptotic stimuli (27Susin S.A. Daugas E. Ravagnan L. Samejima K. Zamzami N. Loeffler M. Costantini P. Ferri K.F. Irinopoulou T. Prevost M.C. Brothers G. Mak T.W. Penninger J. Earnshaw W.C. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This protein lacks intrinsic nuclease activity, suggesting that AIF activates an unidentified nuclease responsible for DNA fragmentation (26Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E. Brothers G.M. Mangion J. Jacotot E. Costantini P. Loeffler M. Larochette N. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Nature. 1999; 397: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (3451) Google Scholar). Seven additional cell death-related nucleases (crn-1 to -6 and cyp-13) have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans through functional genomic analysis, which, along with two known nucleases (CPS-6 and NUC-1), comprise at least two independent pathways that contribute to cell killing by degrading chromosomal DNA. Several of these proteins are components of important cellular processes such as RNA processing, protein folding, and DNA replication and repair, and appear to be important for the survival and proper development of the nematode (28Parrish J.Z. Xue D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 987-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One of the genes found, CYP-13, belongs to the family of cyclophilins, which have been previously involved in chromosomal DNA degradation in vertebrates. Cyclophilins show a nuclease activity distinct from the cis-trans-isomerase one, and their ionic requirements are similar to that described for apoptotic nucleases (29Montague J.W. Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6677-6684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 30Nagata T. Kishi H. Liu Q.L. Yoshino T. Matsuda T. Jin Z.X. Murayama K. Tsukada K. Muraguchi A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cyp C has been shown to induce 50-kbp DNA fragmentation on isolated nuclei (29Montague J.W. Hughes F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6677-6684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas Cyp A has been demonstrated to interact and cooperate with AIF in apoptosis-associated chromatinolysis (31Cande C. Vahsen N. Kouranti I. Schmitt E. Daugas E Spahr C. Luban J. Kroemer R.T. Giordanetto F. Garrido C. Penninger J.M. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that Xenopus egg extracts have a HMW DNA degradation activity activated by Caspase 3, which is different than the Xenopus CAD homolog, whose molecular identity remains uncharacterized (32Lu Z.G. Zhang C.M. Zhai Z.H. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The relationship of this activity with AIF has not been analyzed. Other poorly defined endonuclease activities capable of processing the DNA into 50-kb fragments have also been reported in spermatozoa (33Sotolongo B. Huang T.T. Isenberger E. Ward W.S. J. Androl. 2005; 26: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that IMR-5 neuroblastoma cells failed to display LMW DNA fragmentation due to a defect in the ICAD/CAD system that results in a non-functional CAD (9Yuste V.J. Bayascas J.R. Llecha N. Sanchez-Lopez I. Boix J. Comella J.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22323-22331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the current report, we show that IMR-5 cells display HMW DNA fragmentation with undetectable TUNEL reactivity after staurosporine (STP) treatment. To ascertain the importance of ICAD in the nuclear apoptotic changes, we analyzed the contribution of the two caspase-target aspartic residues of ICAD (Asp117 or Asp224) in SH-SY5Y cells. We demonstrate that overexpression of the ICAD-D117E single mutant prevents LMW DNA fragmentation, stage II chromatin condensation, and detection of TUNEL staining, whereas HMW DNA degradation and stage I nuclear morphology remain unaltered. In cells overexpressing wild type ICAD or the ICAD-D224E single mutant no alterations to DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphology were observed. Overexpression of D117E-ICAD does not affect the release of AIF or cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. We show for the first time that dsRNA knock-down of endogenous AIF expression in SH-SY5Y cells abolishes stage I nuclear condensation but not HMW or LMW DNA degradation. Similar results are obtained by intracellular delivery of blocking anti-AIF antibodies. We conclude that CAD is not responsible for HMW DNA degradation and stage I chromatin condensation, and this depends instead on the activity of other endonucleases that generate TUNEL-negative ends on DNA fragments. Our results, together with those reported using the ICAD-/- mice (21Zhang J. Lee H. Lou D.W. Bovin G.P. Xu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), further suggest a role for ICAD in HMW DNA degradation. Chemical Reagents—STP and Me2SO were purchased from Sigma.

Mutated forms of hICAD, hICAD-D117E and hICAD-D224E, were generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for introducing the D117E mutation were, forward: 5′-ATT TCC CAA GAG TCC TTT GAC GTC GAT GAA ACA GAG AGC GGG GCA GGG TTG AAG-3′ and reverse 5′-CTT CAA CCC TGC CCC GCT CTC TGT TTC ATC GAC GTC AAA GGA CTC TTG GGA AAT-3′ (changed positions are indicated in bold).

These primers also introduced a silent mutation that generates a restriction site for EcoRV (underlined). A FLAG epitope was introduced at 5′ position in the wild type and mutant ICAD by PCR using the primers HindIII-FLAG-hICAD (forward) 5′-CCC AAG CTT ATG GAC TAT AAG GAT GAC GAT GAC AAG GAG GTG ACC GGG GAC GCC GGG GTA-3′ and EcoRI-DFF45-R (reverse) 5′-CGG AAT TCT ATG TGG GAT CCT GTC TG GCT-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Final constructs referred to as pcDNA3-hICAD-5′FLAG, pcDNA3-hICAD-D117E-5′FLAG, and pcDNA3-hICAD-D224E-5′FLAG. Empty vector (pcDNA3) was used as control. Cell Culture and Constitutive Transfection—Human SH-SY5Y and IMR-5 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a saturating humidity atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of empty pcDNA3, pcDNA3-hICAD-5′FLAG, pcDNA3-hICAD-D117E-5′FLAG, or pcDNA3-hICAD-D224E-5′FLAG. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stably transfected cells were obtained by selection with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and several clones, as well as the pool of transfected cells, were propagated and tested for ICAD expression and processing by Western blotting. Most of the experiments were carried out using pools of transfected cells. Clones gave comparable results.

Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For trypan blue staining, cells were seeded in 24-multiwell plates at 5-3 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h of seeding, cells were treated with STP at the adequate doses and times. Then cells were gently dissociated with a blue tip in their own culture medium, and a sample (100 μl) was taken and mixed with 20 μl of trypan blue solution (0.4%) (Sigma). Ten microliters of the resulting cell suspension were counted with a hemocytometer. The results were expressed as percentages of trypan blue-stained cells over the total number of cells. Nuclear morphology was assessed by staining cells with the Hoechst 33258, which is also known as bisbenzimide (2′-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2,5′-bi-1H-benzimidazole trihydrochloride) as established in our laboratory (5Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The normal or apoptotic cell nuclei were visualized with an Olympus microscope equipped with epifluorescence optics under UV illumination. dsRNA Preparation and Transfection—Two different dsRNA oligonucleotides against human AIF (R1, CCGGCUCCCAGGCAACUUGdTdT and R2, GCAUGCUUCUACGAUAUAAdTdT) and one scrambled sequence were bioinformatically designed and synthesized (Proligo France, Paris, France). Transfections of 5 × 105 cells with 10 μg of the indicated dsRNA were performed with Nucleofector (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) using the G-04 program and Cell Line Nucleofector Solution V, following manufacturer's instructions. After 2 days, cells were replated in adequate culture dishes, depending on the experiment, and 72 h post transfection, the treatment and the corresponding protocol were performed. Protein Extractions and Western Blotting—When whole protein extracts were used, ∼1 × 106 cells per condition were detached from 35-mm culture dishes, gently pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were lysed in total extraction buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 2% SDS pre-warmed at 95 °C. Mitochondria-free cytosolic extraction of AIF and cytochrome c was performed with 2 × 106 cells seeded on 60-mm plates and treated with STP for the times indicated. After treatment, cells were detached, harvested in PBS, and resuspended in ten volumes of extraction buffer containing 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and kept on ice for 15 min. Cells were centrifuged in a Microfuge at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained. Nuclear and mitochondrial subfractionation extracts were performed with NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Perbio Science France, Brebières, France) following the manufacturer's instructions. In all cases, protein content was quantified by a modified Lowry assay (Bio-Rad Dc protein assay, Bio-Rad). Around 5-25 μg of protein per condition were electrophoresed in 15% (FLAG, ICAD, CAD, caspase-3, and cytochrome c detection), 10% (AIF detection), or 6% (α-fodrin and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase detection) SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were electrotransferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with a semidry apparatus (Hoefer, Amersham Biosciences). Filters were probed with the indicated primary antibodies and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma). As substrates for immunodetection we used either ECL (Amersham Biosciences) or SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). Antibodies used in this study were anti-FLAG M2, anti-Hsp60, anti-actin, anti-cytochrome c, and anti-AIF (Sigma), anti-DFF45/ICAD (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC, Canada), anti-α-spectrin/fodrin, anti-CAD (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase C2.10 (Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA), anti-caspase 3, anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-panERK, anti-SOS-2 (BD Biosciences), and anti-fibrillarin (Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK). When required, the membranes were stained with Naftol Blue to assess comparable loading of lanes. TUNEL Assay and Nuclei Staining—SH-SY5Y and IMR-5 cells were treated with staurosporine as indicated in figure legends. Detection of blunt double-stranded fragments carrying a 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl group was carried out by fixing cells in freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium citrate for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, they were incubated with 50 μl of a reaction mixture containing 0.025 nmol of Fluorescein-12-dUTP, 0.25 nmol of dATP, 2.5 mm CoCl2, 40 units of recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), and TdT reaction buffer from Roche Applied Science for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 mm EGTA. Cells were washed twice with PBS, stained with 0.05 μg/ml Hoechst 33258, mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and photographed under fluorescein isothiocyanate and UV illumination in an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70-S8F2) coupled to a camera (model OM-4 Ti; Olympus). Electron Microscopy—Approximately 3 × 106 cells per condition were detached from 60-mm culture dish, gently pelleted by centrifugation, and washed with PBS. Pellets were fixed at 4 °C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, rinsed three times with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4), dehydrated in graded acetone, and embedded in Durcupan ACM Epoxy resin (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections of selected areas were obtained, mounted in copper grids, counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed with a Zeiss EM910 electron microscopy (Carl Zeiss Microscope Systems, Oberkochen, Germany). DNA Degradation Analysis—High molecular DNA fragmentation was assayed by clamped homogeneous electric fields (CHEF) electrophoresis using a CHEF-DR (Bio-Rad) apparatus. Approximately 2 × 106 cells per condition were suspended in 40 μl of PBS, warmed at 60 °C for 5 min, mixed with an equal volume of warm 1% low melting point agarose in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 8.3), transferred to cold agarose block formers and left at 4 °C for 30 min. Agarose blocks were removed from the block formers and incubated at 50 °C firstly for 24 h in 1 ml of NDS buffer (1% lauryl-Sarkosyl, 10 mm Tris, 0.5 m EDTA, pH 9.5) containing 200 μg/ml proteinase K with gentle shaking. The NDS supernatants were further processed for internucleosomal DNA degradation (LMW DNA degradation). Next, the blocks were further incubated for 24 h with the same buffer containing 10 μg/ml RNase A. After two 1-h washes at room temperature in 0.5 × TBE buffer, the blocks were inserted into wells of a 1% CHEF agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE. Electrophoresis was carried out at 6 V/cm for 14 h at 14 °C with a switch time of 5-50 s. For LMW DNA degradation, equal volumes of NDS supernatants and cold 100% ethanol were mixed, and the mixture was incubated at -20 °C overnight and centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were washed once in 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA) containing 200 μg/ml RNase 15 min at 60 °C. DNA was analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel in TAE buffer (1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.6) stained with ethidium bromide. Cell cycle analysis and sub-G1 peak of DNA fragmentation were performed using propidium iodide staining. Briefly, after treatments, cells were recovered, rinsed with PBS, and resuspended with PBS containing 0.5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, and 50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase. After 20 min of incubation, DNA content was determined using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) flow cytometer. Data were analyzed by CellQuest software.

https://openalex.org/W2032825057,"PDZ domains are protein adapter modules present in a few hundred human proteins. They play important roles in scaffolding and signal transduction. PDZ domains usually bind to the C termini of their target proteins. To assess the binding mechanism of this interaction we have performed the first in-solution kinetic study for PDZ domains and peptides corresponding to target ligands. Both PDZ3 from postsynaptic density protein 95 and PDZ2 from protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 bind their respective target peptides through an apparent A + B → A·B mechanism without rate-limiting conformational changes. But a mutant with a fluorescent probe (Trp) outside of the binding pocket suggests that slight changes in the structure take place upon binding in protein tyrosine phosphatase-L1 PDZ2. For PDZ3 from postsynaptic density protein 95 the pH dependence of the binding reaction is consistent with a one-step mechanism with one titratable group. The salt dependence of the interaction shows that the formation of electrostatic interactions is rate-limiting for the association reaction but not for dissociation of the complex.

These domains mediate binding to other proteins and in this way play important roles in scaffolding and signal transduction (1Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol.

Structural studies have shown that the PDZ domains usually bind to the C terminus of their target proteins. A number of crystal and NMR structures of PDZ domains have been solved both with and without bound peptide (for example, Refs 3Long J.F. Tochio H. Wang P. Fan J.S. Sala C. Niethammer M. Sheng M.

Moreover, theory and NMR experiments have suggested that the dynamics of PDZ domains and the residues outside of the binding pocket influence their interaction with ligands (12Fuentes E.J. Der C.J.

Kinetics of chemical reactions not only provide “end point data” such as equilibrium constants but also yield microscopic rate constants and, more importantly, the possibility of elucidating the mechanisms of binding and probing the binding dynamics as well as the properties of the transition state of the reaction. To assess the binding mechanism, we have performed the first kinetic study of PDZ domains in solution using stopped-flow fluorimetry. The PDZ domains chosen were PDZ3 from human PSD-95, one of the most well studied PDZ domains, and the second PDZ domain from mouse protein tyrosine phosphatase-L1 (PTP-BL; also known as PTPL1, PTP-BAS, PTP1E, FAP-1, or PTPN13).MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of PSD-95 PDZ3—The cDNA encoding PDZ3 of human PSD-95 (residues 352-444) was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of a modified pRSET vector (Invitrogen) (resulting in a clone expressing His-tagged PDZ3). The plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) pLys (Invitrogen), and protein expression was initiated by inducing 800-ml bacterial cultures with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of ∼0.5. The cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C, and the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, and the bacteria were lysed by ultrasonication. After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and loaded onto a nickel(II)-charged chelating Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 400 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. After washing with the same buffer, the His-tagged PSD-95 PDZ3 was eluted with 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.9. 20 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The sample was then diluted 3-fold in water and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Bound protein was eluted with a linear 0-0.5 m NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Fractions containing pure PSD-95 PDZ3, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, and identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The PSD-95 PDZ3 used in the present study contained 95 residues, two non-native residues in the N terminus (Gly and Ser, resulting from the thrombin recognition and BamHI sites) and residues 352-444 from human PSD-95 (numbered 1-95). Expression, purification, and numbering of the residues of mouse PTP-BL PDZ2 were as described previously (25Walma T. Spronk C.A. Tessari M. Aelen J. Schepens J. Hendriks W. Vuister G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Peptide Synthesis—The peptides KQTSVCOO- and EQVSAVCOO- were synthesized in an ABI 431 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using standard FastMoc chemistry and Val-Wang resin to obtain a free carboxylate in the C terminus. A dansyl group was attached to the N termini of the peptides by incubating the peptide-containing resin with a ∼4-fold excess of dansyl chloride (Sigma) and an 8-fold excess of N-ethyldiisopropylamine over the peptide N-amino group in N,N-dimethylformamide. The peptides were deprotected, purified by reverse phase chromatography, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Concentrations of peptide and protein solutions (and thus extinction coefficients) were determined by amino acid analyses.Spectroscopic Experiments—Buffers for experiments were made by dissolving the appropriate amount of acid and base (potassium salt where applicable) in H2O (18 megaohms resistance) and adjusting the ionic strength with potassium chloride. The following buffers were used at different pH values: acetate, <5.8; MES, 5.9-6.1; phosphate, 6.4-8.0; and Tris, 8.4-9. Urea-induced denaturation experiments for PSD-95 PDZ3 were performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate and 21 mm potassium chloride at 25 °C (I = 150 mm). The pH and urea denaturation of wild-type PSD-95 PDZ3 was monitored by far-UV circular dichroism in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Urea denaturation of the F31W mutant of PSD-95 PDZ3 was monitored by following Trp fluorescence in an SLM 4800 spectrofluorimeter (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). Data were fitted to the standard equation for solvent denaturation (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 132-168Google Scholar). Binding kinetics were measured at 10 °C on an SX-18MV spectrometer or a π*-180 spectrometer, both from Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, UK). PDZ and peptide at different concentrations in identical buffers were rapidly mixed, and fluorescence was monitored using either the dansyl group in the peptide as probe (excitation at 345 nm, emission at >420 nm) or an engineered tryptophan (F31W in PSD-95 PDZ3 and Y43W in PTP-BL PDZ2) in the PDZ domain (excitation at 280 nm, emission at >360 nm or >475 nm). When both probes were used in the same experiment, energy transfer from the excited Trp residue to the dansyl group was observed. 5S. Gianni, C. C. Ngang, Å. Engström, M. Larsson, N. Calosci, C. Travaglini-Allocatelli, and P. Jemth, manuscript in preparation. Data Analysis—The equations for analysis of bimolecular reactions under second order conditions have been derived recently (27Malatesta F. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 116: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The general equation for reversible association of two molecules is shown in Equation 1, A=ΔAEQ(1−e−kobst)/(1+ωe−kobst)(Eq.1) where A is the amount or concentration of product formed at time t, ΔAEQ is the total product formed at equilibrium, and ω a parameter that varies between -1 and 0, depending on how well the experiment is obeying pseudo-first order kinetics. For PDZ-peptide interactions it was found that ω is close to 0, and Equation 1 breaks down to a single exponential. The dependence of the observed rate constant kobs on ligand concentration for a reversible association reaction follows Equation 2, kobs=k12(n−[A]0)2+K−12+2k1k−1(n+[A]0)(Eq.2) where k1 is the association or on-rate constant, k-1 is the dissociation or off-rate constant, and [A]0 and n are the respective initial concentrations of the two reacting molecules. In a typical experiment one species is varied ([A]0), whereas the other is held constant (n). The concentration of the constant species n can either be fitted together with k1 and k-1 (if the quality of the data is good enough) or can be set to the independently determined value. Under pseudo-first order conditions where, for example, [A]0 >> n, Equation 2 breaks down to the commonly used Equation 3 (26Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 132-168Google Scholar) shown here. kobs=k1[A]0+k−1(Eq.3) End points from time-resolved fluorometric measurements were fitted to the standard quadratic equation for equilibrium binding shown in Equation 4, F=[([A]0+KD+n)/2−([A]0+KD+n)2/4−[A]0n]×B+C(Eq.4) where F is the observed fluorescence signal, n and [A]0 are the total concentrations of non-varied and varied species, respectively, and KD is the equilibrium dissociation constant. B and C are constants that take into account the total fluorescence change and fluorescence at [A]0 = 0, respectively. The amplitudes of the kinetic traces were fitted to a similar equation, but assuming F = 0 (or more correctly ΔF = 0) at [A]0 = 0, i.e. C in Equation 4 = 0.The pH dependence of rate and equilibrium constants are often complex but can sometimes be approximated by the standard equation for one titratable group, which was the case for the off-rate constant k-1 as seen here in Equation 5, k=A×[10(pKa−pH)/(1+10(pKa−pH)]+B×[1/(1+10(pKa−pH)](Eq.5) where A is the value of the pH-dependent constant at low pH and B is the value of this constant at high pH.The dependence of the rate constants (k) on ionic strength was analyzed according to the Debye-Hückel theory (28Moore W.J. Basic Physical Chemistry. Prentice-Hall International, Inc., London1983: 370-375Google Scholar, 29Brønsted J.N. La Mer V.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1924; 46: 555-573Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 6, log k=log k0+2CzAzBI0.5(Eq.6) where k0 is the value of the rate constant in absence of salt, C is a constant close to 0.5 (liter/mol)0.5 in aqueous solution (28Moore W.J. Basic Physical Chemistry. Prentice-Hall International, Inc., London1983: 370-375Google Scholar), zA and zB are the respective charges of the interacting molecules or moieties, and I is the ionic strength of the solution (m). Fitting of the data were performed using the APP software and the Kaleidagraph version 3.6 package (Synergy Software).RESULTSStructure and Stability of the PDZ Domains—PDZ domains typically consist of six β-strands, βA-βF, and two α-helices, αA and αB (see Fig. 1). The PSD-95 PDZ3 used contained five residues N-terminal to the first β-strand βA (GSREP) and eight residues after the last strand βF (PEEYSRFE). (The numbering of the residues in this paper starts with Gly-1 and ends with Glu-95.) The protein was thus slightly different from that crystallized by Doyle et al. (6Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) in that it did not contain an extra non-native C-terminal β-sheet and had fewer residues in the N terminus. By analyzing tryptic peptides with mass spectrometry we found that Asn-57 of PSD-95 PDZ3 and Asn-69 of mouse PTP-BL PDZ2 were deamidated, but it is difficult to determine whether the deamidation takes place before or after trypsin digestion. The Asn residues are followed by a Gly, which is a sequence that is prone to deamidation (30Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Asn residues are solvent-exposed and situated in the turn following βD, far from the peptide-binding site, we find it unlikely that the possible deamidation affects ligand binding. Circular dichroism spectra at different pH values and urea denaturation (Fig. 2) showed that both the wild-type and F31W mutant of PSD-95 PDZ3 were folded under the conditions of the binding experiments. The extrapolated stability at pH 7.4 and 25 °C was 6-6.5 kcal mol-1 in buffer without urea for both wild-type and F31W PSD-95 PDZ3. The stability of mouse PTP-BL PDZ2 was previously determined as 3 kcal mol-1 under the experimental conditions (31Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C.

Upon binding of the peptide to PSD-95 PDZ3 the fluorescence of the dansyl group was increased (λexc = 345 nm; λem > 420 nm), and time-resolved binding traces could be recorded (Fig. 3). In binding experiments with PTP-BL PDZ2, the dansylated peptide used was D-EQVSAV, corresponding to the C terminus of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor RA-GEF-2 (32Gao X. Satoh T. Liao Y.

Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The length of the peptide used may influence the affinity. In this work we designed the peptides based on their interactions with the respective PDZ domain in the crystal (6Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar) or NMR (4Kozlov G. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) structure. Also, to get a change in fluorescence upon binding, the dansyl group must be close to the protein in the bound state. However, the peptide D-EQVSAV did not display a change in dansyl fluorescence upon binding to PTP-BL PDZ2 (λexc = 345 nm;λem > 475 nm). To obtain a second probe for ligand binding, a mutation in βC was employed, namely Phe-31 (PSD-95 PDZ3) or Tyr-43 (PTP-BL PDZ2) → Trp (see Fig. 1). A Trp in this position was previously shown to function as a probe for protein folding studies (31Gianni S. Calosci N. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Brunori M. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2005; 18: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 33Feng H. Vu N.D. Bai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In PSD-95 PDZ3 the side chain of the Phe-31 is stacked betweenβB, the C-terminal helix (mainly Glu-90, Tyr-91, and Phe-94), and βD (mainly Gln-52) (Fig. 1). No part of Phe-31 is in direct contact with the peptide, but its Cβ and backbone atoms make contacts with Ile-21 and Val-22 that, in turn, interact with the bound peptide (6Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of human PTP-BL PDZ2 and bound peptide (4Kozlov G. Banville D. Gehring K. Ekiel I. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) shows that the side chain of the Tyr residue in the corresponding position is partially solvent-exposed. The main interactions of the Tyr side chain are with Val-44 (βC) and Val-37 (loop connecting βB and βC) and Gly-62 and Arg-64 at the beginning of βD (numbering according to Walma et al.) (25Walma T.

Again, Tyr-43 is not making direct interactions with the bound peptide, although its Cβ and backbone atoms make contacts with residues in βB (e.g. Val-29 and Thr-30) that, in turn, interact with the peptide.FIGURE 3Kinetics of the interaction between PSD-95 PDZ3 and the dansylated peptide D-KQTSV.

Wild-type PSD-95 PDZ3 and the F31W mutant displayed similar rate constants for the interaction with D-KQTSV (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrate that the F31W mutant of PSD-95 PDZ3 is a valid substitute for the wild-type in binding experiments. Because the dansyl fluorescence of D-EQVSAV did not change upon binding to wild-type PTP-BL PDZ2, the binding constants could not be determined; but given the structural similarities between PDZ domains, we find it likely that the Y43W mutant serves as a legitimate model for binding studies. Both D-EQVSAV and the peptide without label, EQVSAV, bound to PTP-BL PDZ2 Y43W with similar rate constants (TABLE ONE). However, because of a Förster resonance energy transfer between the Trp and the dansyl group, the signal change was much larger using the dansylated peptide (absorption maximum for dansyl is at 330 nm, close to the emission maximum for Trp). Energy transfer was observed in the F31W-D-KQTSV interaction as well, and the details of this effect will be published elsewhere.FIGURE 4Kinetics of the interaction between mouse PTP-BL PDZ2 Y43W and the non-dansylated peptide EQVSAV.

Under second order conditions the kinetics may or may not follow single exponential kinetics, depending on the two microscopic rate constants and initial reagent concentration (see Ref. 27Malatesta F. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 116: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and “Materials and Methods”). The present experiments were performed under both pseudo-first order and second order conditions, and the observed rate constants obtained were analyzed accordingly (see “Materials and Methods”). The observed rate constants were well described by a one-step model without rate-limiting conformational changes (Scheme 1, Equation 2, and Figs. 3, 4). The on-rate constants k1 for both PSD-95 PDZ3 and PTP-BL PDZ2 Y43W were in the range of 106-107 m-1 s-1 at 10 °C, whereas the off-rate constants k-1 varied between 5 and 40 s-1 for PSD-95 PDZ3 and 40 and 70 s-1 for PTP-BL PDZ2 Y43W, depending on the pH value and salt concentration (Fig. 5 and TABLE ONE). Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD values) calculated from the rate constants thus ranged from 0.6 to 7 μm, depending on the conditions. KD values can be calculated from amplitudes and end points of the kinetic traces. The end points correspond to data obtained from an equilibrium binding experiment, given that there are no slow conformational changes occurring after collection of stopped-flow data. The KD values for the PSD-95 PDZ3-peptide interaction obtained from kinetic amplitudes and rate constants were generally lower than the KD values obtained from the end points of the kinetic traces (TABLE ONE and Fig. 6). The accuracy of the KD values from rate constants are higher because the quadratic equation used for estimating KD values for equilibrium titrations (Equation 4) is more dependent on a correct value of the non-varied species and is also less forgiving of scatter in the data.FIGURE 5The on-rate constant k1 and the off-rate constant k-1 as a function"
https://openalex.org/W2147421435,"Rac and its downstream effectors p21-activated kinase (PAK) family kinases regulate actin dynamics within growth cones to control neurite outgrowth during development. The activity of Rac is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that promote GDP release and GTP binding. ALS2/Alsin is a recently described GEF that contains a central domain that is predicted to regulate the activities of Rac and/or Rho and Cdc42 activities. Mutations in ALS2 cause some recessive familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but the function of ALS2 is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that ALS2 is present within growth cones of neurons, in which it co-localizes with Rac. Furthermore, ALS2 stimulates Rac but not Rho or Cdc42 activities, and this induces a corresponding increase in PAK1 activity. Finally, we demonstrate that ALS2 promotes neurite outgrowth. Defects in these functions may therefore contribute to motor neuron demise in ALS."

However, the molecular mechanism of maspin remains illusive, primarily because its molecular targets are unknown. To this end, we used a full-length maspin cDNA bait to screen against both a primary prostate tumor cDNA prey library and a HeLa cDNA prey library by the yeast two-hybrid method. We found that heat shock protein 90, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and heat shock protein 70 interacted with maspin with the highest frequencies. We confirmed the maspin/GST interaction using purified proteins, human epithelial cell lines, and human prostate tissues. A maspin variant that has a point mutation of Arg340 to Ala (MasR340A) showed a significantly decreased affinity for GST. Although purified maspin had no effect on the activity of purified GST in vitro, intracellular interaction between endogenous maspin and GST correlated with an elevated total GST activity in both MDA-MB-435- and DU145-derived stably transfected cells. Consistently, tumor cells treated with purified wild type maspin, but not MasR340A, enhanced cellular GST activity. Maspin expression in cancer cell lines also correlated with decreased basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, H2O2 treatment not only induced GST expression but also increased intracellular maspin/GST interaction, which was inversely correlated with the level of ROS generation. Conversely, maspin knockdown by small interfering RNA increased the basal, as well as H2O2-induced, ROS generation. Furthermore, the maspin effect on ROS generation was completely abolished by a GST inhibitor, indicating an essential role of GST in maspin-mediated cellular response to oxidative stress. Consistently, oxidative stress-induced vascular endothelial growth factor A expression was significantly inhibited in maspin-expressing cells. Together, our data suggest a new mechanism by which maspin, through its direct interaction with GST, may inhibit oxidative stress-induced ROS generation and vascular endothelial growth factor A induction, thus preventing further adverse effects on tumor genetics and stromal reactivity.

More recently, we showed that maspin expression inhibited prostate carcinoma bone tumor growth, osteolysis, and angiogenesis in a clinically relevant in vivo model (5Cher M.L. Biliran Jr., H.R. Bhagat S. Meng Y. Che M. Lockett J. Abrams J. Fridman R. Zachareas M. Sheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Consistently, differential expression of maspin has been linked to the progression of many types of human cancers. For example, in breast, colon, thyroid, lung, oral squamous, and prostate cancer, maspin expression predicts a better prognosis (6Sheng S. Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 2733-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Considering the therapeutic potential of maspin, it is critical to understand its molecular mechanisms. Three functional features of maspin are particularly noteworthy. First, an inhibitory effect of maspin on cell surface-associated urokinase-type plasminogen activator/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor complex is consistent with its effect on tumor cell motility and invasion (7McGowen R. Biliran Jr., H. Sager R. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4771-4778PubMed Google Scholar, 8Biliran Jr., H. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8676-8682PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to known inhibitory serpins that bind to active serine protease targets, we found that maspin specifically bound to pro-urokinase-type plasminogen activator and inhibited its proteolytic activation. 3H. Biliran, submitted for publication. 3H. Biliran, submitted for publication. Second, although maspin is expressed by epithelial cells, documented evidence demonstrates that it also exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor-induced stromal reactivities such as angiogenesis and bone remodeling in vivo (5Cher M.L. Biliran Jr., H.R. Bhagat S. Meng Y. Che M. Lockett J. Abrams J. Fridman R. Zachareas M. Sheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7847-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Third, intracellular, but not extracellular, maspin sensitizes breast and prostate cancer cells to drug-induced apoptosis (10Latha K. Zhang W. Cella N. Shi H.Y. Zhang M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1737-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Li Z. Shi H.Y. Zhang M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2008-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Liu J. Yin S. Reddy N.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4089-4098Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In fact, maspin is among only a few pro-apoptotic serpins. These observations led to the question whether the multifaceted biological effects of maspin derive from one central tumor-suppressive mechanism. The key to this question is to identify the maspin-associated molecules. In particular, despite the long-standing observation that maspin is also a cytoplasmic protein, its intracellular interacting proteins have not been identified. An earlier yeast two-hybrid screening using a C-terminal-truncated maspin bait against a fibroblast cDNA library led to the identification of collagen I and IV as the candidate maspin targets (14Blacque O.E. Worrall D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10783-10788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, this result has not been reproduced in epithelial cells and is not supported by the crystallographic analyses of maspin structure (15Al-Ayyoubi M. Gettins P.G. Volz K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55540-55544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening study using the full-length maspin as the bait and prey cDNA libraries derived from a human primary prostate tumor and HeLa cells. We report here that maspin specifically interacted with three stress-related proteins, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). While further studies of the maspin interaction with other candidates are underway, we further characterized the maspin interaction with GST. Our cellular, molecular, and biochemical evidence suggests that maspin may exert a tumor-suppressive effect on tumor genetic/epigenetic instability and tumor-induced VEGF-dependent angiogenesis by regulating the GST-based cellular defense against oxidative stress. This novel mechanism could not have been predicted had GST not been identified as a maspin interactor. Nonetheless, it not only helps explain the biological activities of maspin but also suggests exciting new avenues for maspin-based drug developments.

The full-length maspin coding sequence was excised from the previously constructed plasmid pGEX-2T-maspin (17Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fused in-frame N-terminal to the LexA DNA-binding domain of pEG202. The correct orientation and in-frame fusion were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The bait plasmid containing the LexA-maspin fusion protein was introduced into yeast strain RFY206, which has the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (19Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using both anti-maspin and anti-LexA antibodies. The human primary prostate tumor cDNA library and HeLa cDNA library cloned into pJG4-5 plasmid were obtained from OriGene Technology Inc. (Rockville, MD) and maintained in yeast strain RFY231, which contains LEU2 reporter gene (20Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described (19Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 20Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14266-14271Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To check whether maspin bait alone would activate the reporter gene LEU2, the bait strain was mated with the RFY231 strain containing the empty pJG4-5 vector (18Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The number of total colony-forming units and Leu+ colonies were counted. The ratio of Leu+ colonies against total colony-forming units was 2 × 10-7, demonstrating that the background was low and the maspin bait plasmid was applicable for yeast two-hybrid screening. Maspin bait strain was mated with the prey strain. With each prey library, 250 Leu+ colonies were selected from 5 × 107 diploid colony-forming units. Colonies were screened for their galactose-dependent Leu+ and LacZ+ phenotype. Prey plasmids were rescued from the galactose-dependent Leu+ and LacZ+ colonies by a yeast mini-prep method as described (21Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning Expresion Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed using primers BCO1 and BCO2 to amplify the insert (21Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Hames B.D.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning Expresion Systems: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 169-203Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes AluI and HaeIII to avoid sequencing identical clones (22Kolonin M.G. Zhong J. Finley R.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 26-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting DNA was used to transform E. coli KC8 for amplification and purification. The purified prey plasmid DNAs were introduced back into yeast strain RFY231, and transformants were mated with RFY206/pSH18-34 containing maspin bait or other randomly chosen baits (LexA fusion bait plasmids pEG202-DmcycJ (23Kolonin M.G. Finley Jr., R.L. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), pEG202-DmRux (24Thomas B.J. Zavitz K.H. Dong X. Lane M.E. Weigmann K. Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Lehner C.F. Zipursky S.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and pJG21-1 (18Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar)). The prey clones that gave rise to a specific interaction with the maspin bait, but not with random baits, were sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST search program. ELISA Assay—Triplicate of 0.5 μg of rMaspin, rMasR340A, or BSA in 100 μl of coating buffer (40 mm Na2CO3·H2O and 60 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.9) were added to a 96-well Nunc-Immuno™ plate (MaxiSorp™ Surface; Rochester, NY), incubated at 4 °C for overnight, and blocked by 5% skim milk/PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature (RT). 100 μl of purified GST at 5 μg/ml was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at RT. The plate was then incubated sequentially with 100 μl/well of anti-GST McAb (4,000-fold diluted in 5% milk/PBS solution) for 1 h at RT and with 100 μl/well of 5,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at RT. Between steps, the plate was washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Triplicate reactions without purified GST were performed to calibrate the background. The bound horseradish peroxidase was detected by its reaction with o-phenylenediamine substrate as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma) and was quantified by photometric absorbance at 492 nm using a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Total lysate of MCF10A, CRL2220N, or PC3 cells was obtained by lysing the cells in RIPA buffer. Protein G/A-agarose beads, at a final concentration of 5% (v/v), were incubated with 400 μg of total lysate to block nonspecific immunoglobulins. The resulting mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s, and the harvested supernatant was used for subsequent IP. Briefly, cell lysate supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of maspin McAb or 5 μg of normal mouse IgG with gentle agitation at 4 °C overnight. Protein G/A beads were then added to a final concentration of 2.5% (v/v). The mixture was further incubated for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s. The harvested beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer, each with a decreasing concentration of Nonidet P-40 (1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1%). The beads were then washed with PBS and resuspended with SDS sample buffer, heat denatured, and subjected to Western blot analyses. To test maspin/GST interaction in fresh human tissues, histologically confirmed prostate carcinoma tissues, along with the adjacent normal tissues of the respective patients, were briefly minced on ice. Tissue granules were then transferred into precooled 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes with 300 μl of RIPA buffer and homogenized 20 strokes with a motor-driven mini-homogenizer in an ice bath. After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were harvested and 800 μg of total protein were used for each IP. Anti-maspin McAb and anti-GST μ polyclonal antibody were used for IP. GSH Affinity Pulldown Assay—Binding of purified maspin to GST was examined by the affinity pulldown assay. Briefly, 1 μg of purified GST (in 500 μl of PBS) was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B beads (50% slurry) for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with 1 μg of rMaspin in 500 μl of PBS at RT for 2 h in the presence or absence of 20 μg of BSA. After washing the beads six times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, the bound proteins were eluted with reduced glutathione buffer, denatured in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to Western blot assay. In a negative control experiment, 1 μg of maspin was heat denatured by boiling for 10 min prior to incubation with the GST/GSH beads. Binding of endogenously expressed maspin to GST was examined in a similar manner except 200 μg of total extracts of cells or freshly harvested frozen human prostate tissues were used in the place of purified GST. Cell extracts were made by lysing the cells in RIPA buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). FLAG-Maspin/GST Interaction under H2O2 Treatment—To express FLAG-Maspin, cells were transiently transfected with pCMV-Tag2-maspin plasmid DNA using the Effectene transfection reagent kit (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were treated with either H2O2 at various concentrations for another 24 h or TRAIL (50 ng/ml) for 1 h as a non-oxidative stress control. Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and lysed by lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% TRITON™ X-100 buffer, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Total cell lysate (1 mg) from each sample was subjected to IP using FLAG M2 antibody immobilized to agarose beads as instructed by the manufacturer (Sigma). After the resin was collected and washed with Tris-buffered saline, the bound proteins were eluted with Tris-buffered saline buffer containing 3× FLAG peptide (150 μg/ml) and subjected to Western blotting. GST Activity Assay—To test the effect of maspin on cellular GST activity, cells, with or without maspin overexpression, were lysed by three cycles of sonication on ice (10 s/cycle with a 1-min interval) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To test the specificity of the maspin effect on GST activity, MDA-MB-435 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate (2 × 105 cells/well) and treated with 5 μg/ml of rMaspin, rMasR340A, or BSA for 24 h. The resulting supernatants were analyzed by the same GST activity assay. The total GST activity in the resulting supernatants was determined using a GST detection module kit (Amersham Biosciences). The changes in absorbance at 340 nm over a 5-min period were used to calculate GST activities (25Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—Fluorogenic substrate 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) was used to react with intracellular ROS for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as described (26Robinson J.P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Dean P.N. Hibbs A.R. Orfao A. Rabinovitch P.S. Wheeless L.L. Current Protocols in Cytometry: Oxidative Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 9.7Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 maspin or mock transfectant cells were incubated with 20 μm DCFH-DA in a 5-ml suspension at 37 °C for 10 min. The cells were divided into 250-μl aliquots and added into FACS sample tubes. Triplicate aliquots of cells that were either untreated or treated with H2O2 at the indicated final concentrations at 37 °C for 30 min, or PMA at 1 μg/ml at 37 °C for 30 min, were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The FACS measurements made at the moment of H2O2 addition were used as background. Data analysis was based on 10,000 detected events using the Cell Quest software. Alternatively, to detect ROS in cell lysates, cells pretreated with 20 μm H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37 °C were cultured either with or without the H2O2 (1 or 10 mm) insult for 30 min, washed with PBS two times, and lysed by RIPA buffer. The resulting total cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Changes of fluorescence at 488/583 nm in the supernatants were quantified by a SPECTRAmax Gemini plate reader (Molecular Devices). To study the effect of GST inhibition on the cellular capacity of ROS generation, cells harvested from adherent monolayer cultures were suspended to a final density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in a mitochondria isolation buffer (180 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, and 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, pH 7.2) containing 20 μm H2DCFDA. The cells were lysed by incubation with digitonin to the final concentration of 0.02% for 4 min at RT and subsequently diluted with the same volume of the mitochondria isolation buffer. The GST activity in the resulting total cell lysates was neutralized with 200 μm GST inhibitor EA (RT for 3 min). The mixtures thus obtained were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 10 min prior to the fluorescence measurements at 488/538 nm using a SPECTRAmax Gemini plate reader. Cells processed in parallel treated with only EA or H2O2 were used as background controls. Confocal Immunofluorescent Staining—The intracellular colocalization of maspin with GST was examined using an immunofluorescent staining procedure as described previously (12Liu J. Yin S. Reddy N. Spencer C. Sheng S. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1703-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). M7 cells cultured on chamber slides were either untreated or treated with 100 μm H2O2 for 24 h. Cells were washed two times with PBS, fixed in 3.8% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h, and subsequently incubated with maspin polyclonal antibody and GST McAb at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed five times with PBS and incubated with Oregon Green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at RT for 1 h. Finally, the cells were mounted using Prolong Antifade solution. Confocal microscopy examination was performed using a Zeiss LSM 310 model (The Imaging Core Facility of the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI). Real-time PCR—Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of the RNA preparations was verified by RNA-agarose gel electrophoresis showing intact 18 and 28 S RNA and by UV spectrophotometry showing an optimal A260:A280 ratio (1.8-2.0). One microgram of each total RNA sample was reverse transcribed. For real-time PCR, Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene) was used together with 1 μl of cDNA and 200 nm primers for maspin, GST μ3, VEGF-A, or GAPDH. The primer sequences for VEGF-A are 5′-TGCCTTGCTGCTCTACCTCC-3′ and 5′-TCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC-3′. The primer sequences for maspin are 5′-CTACTTTGTTGGCAAGTGGATGAA-3′ and 5′-ACTGGTTTGGTGTCTGTCTTGTTG-3′.

It requires sulfide for growth. Sulfite is inhibitory to the methanogens. Yet, we observed that <i>M. jannaschii</i> grows and produces methane with sulfite as the sole sulfur source. We found that in this organism sulfite induces a novel, highly active, coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>-dependent sulfite reductase (Fsr) with a cell extract specific activity of 0.57 μmol sulfite reduced min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup> protein. The cellular level of Fsr protein is comparable to that of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme essential for methanogenesis and a possible target for sulfite. Purified Fsr reduces sulfite to sulfide using reduced F<sub>420</sub> (H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>420</sub>) as the electron source (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>: sulfite, 12 μm; H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>420</sub>, 21 μm). Therefore, Fsr provides <i>M. jannaschii</i> an anabolic ability and protection from sulfite toxicity. The N-terminal half of the 70-kDa Fsr polypeptide represents a H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>420</sub> dehydrogenase and the C-terminal half a dissimilatory-type siroheme sulfite reductase, and Fsr catalyzes the corresponding partial reactions. Previously described sulfite reductases use nicotinamides and cytochromes as electron carriers. Therefore, this is the first report of a coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>-dependent sulfite reductase. Fsr homologs were found only in <i>Methanopyrus kandleri</i> and <i>Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus</i>, two strictly hydrogenotrophic thermophilic methanogens. <i>fsr</i> is the likely ancestor of H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>420</sub> dehydrogenases, which serve as electron input units for membrane-based energy transduction systems of certain late evolving archaea, and dissimilatory sulfite reductases of bacteria and archaea. <i>fsr</i> could also have arisen from lateral gene transfer and gene fusion events."

In this study, we investigate the presence of IKK sites in TAD2 of p65. Recombinant IKKbeta, but not IKKalpha, phosphorylated a GST-p65 substrate in which TAD1 was deleted. Mutational analysis revealed S468 as the only IKK site in TAD2. S468 phosphorylation occurred rapidly after TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in T cell, B cell, cervix carcinoma, hepatoma, breast cancer, and astrocytoma lines and in primary hepatic stellate cells as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells. S468-phosphorylated p65 coimmunoprecipitated with IkappaBalpha, indicating that p65 is phosphorylated while bound to IkappaBalpha. Dominant negative IKKbeta or pharmacological IKK inhibition blocked S468 phosphorylation after TNF-alpha or IL-1beta, whereas dominant negative IKKalpha or inhibitors of MEK, p38, JNK, PI-3 kinase, or GSK-3 had no effect. p65S468A-reconstituted p65-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) showed a small, but significant, elevation of NF-kappaB-driven luciferase activity and RANTES mRNA levels after TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in comparison to wtp65-reconstituted MEFs. p65 nuclear translocation was not altered in p65S468A-expressing MEFs. In conclusion, our results indicate that 1) IKKbeta phosphorylates multiple p65 sites, 2) IKKbeta phosphorylates p65 in an IkappaB-p65 complex, and 3) S468 phosphorylation slightly reduces TNF-alpha- and IL-1beta-induced NF-kappaB activation."
https://openalex.org/W1999956350,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as KDR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) regulating mitogenic, chemotactic, permeability, and survival signals in vascular endothelial cells (EC) in response to its ligand, vascular permeability factor/VEGF (VPF/VEGF), arguably the most important angiogenic cytokine. However, the compartmentalization of KDR in EC and the mechanisms regulating this process have not been well defined. Here, we demonstrate that KDR is present on the plasma membrane, on endosomes, and in the perinuclear region of EC and colocalizes with early endosomal antigen (EEA1), caveolin-1, and dynamin-2, a signal transducing GTPase involved in receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, we also observed that dynamin-2 coimmunoprecipitates with KDR and is required for EC signaling/survival. Interestingly, EC overexpressing a mutant form of dynamin deficient in GTP binding (K44A) caused a selective inhibition in KDR protein level and endosomal vesicle formation and induced cell cycle arrest by inducing p21. Taken together, our findings suggest that dynamin-2 regulates KDR expression and function and hence plays an important role in VPF/VEGF mediated angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2070904317,"The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor (NMDAR) plays central roles in normal and pathological neuronal functioning. We have examined the regulation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR in response to excessive activation of this receptor in in vitro and in vivo models of excitotoxicity. NR1 protein expression in cultured cortical neurons was specifically reduced by stimulation with 100 μm NMDA or glutamate. NMDA decreased NR1 protein amounts by 71% after 8 h. Low NMDA concentrations (≤ 10 μm) had no effect. NR1 down-regulation was inhibited by the general NMDAR antagonist DL-AP5 and also by ifenprodil, which specifically antagonizes NMDARs containing NR2B subunits. Arrest of NMDAR signaling with DL-AP5 after brief exposure to NMDA did not prevent subsequent NR1 decrease. Down-regulation of NR1 did not involve calpain cleavage but resulted from a decrease in de novo synthesis consequence of reduced mRNA amounts. In contrast, NMDA did not alter the expression of NR2A mRNA or newly synthesized protein. In neurons transiently transfected with an NR1 promoter/luciferase reporter construct, promoter activity was reduced by 68% after 2 h of stimulation with NMDA, and its inhibition required extracellular calcium. A similar mechanism of autoregulation of the receptor probably operates during cerebral ischemia, because NR1 mRNA and protein were strongly decreased at early stages of blood reperfusion in the infarcted brains of rats subjected to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.

Post-transcriptional mechanisms also contribute to NR1 regulation in brain development, and two pools of mRNA, with different translational activities, have been described (20Awobuluyi M. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, an important level of control is exerted at the level of protein turnover and trafficking. There is a close coordination in neurons between the assembly of functional heteromeric receptors and the fate of the individual subunits, as exemplified by the existence of two pools of NR1 protein that are differently assembled to the NR2 subunits and that have distinct turnover rates (21Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Hall R.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This dynamic regulation of NMDAR expression and function is highly sensitive to activation of the receptors by their ligands; activation-dependent targeting and trafficking of NMDARs to and from synapses is fundamental to synaptic maturation and plasticity and is driven by mechanisms that accurately regulate receptor number (12Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 24Carroll R.C. Zukin R.S. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 571-577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We are interested in how NMDAR expression and function are affected by overactivation of this receptor by excitotoxic brain insults. In cultured neurons and during forebrain ischemia, excitotoxicity induces C-terminal cleavage of the NR2A and NR2B subunits (25Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dong Y.N. Waxman E.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11035-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Wu H.Y.

This cleavage is mediated by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain and might represent a negative feedback mechanism to down-regulate NMDAR function. Such a possibility is supported by the significant reduction in whole cell NMDAR-mediated currents induced by prolonged stimulation of acutely isolated or cultured cortical neurons with glutamate or NMDA (27Wu H.Y. Yuen E.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Yan Z. Tomizawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21588-21593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the role of NR1 subunits in the response to NMDAR overactivation has remained to be established. In this study, we have examined the effect of NMDAR overstimulation on NR1 expression in vitro and in vivo. We show that brief exposure of cortical neurons to excitotoxic concentrations of NMDA provokes a rapid, specific, and irreversible inhibition of NR1 transcription via a mechanism that requires the activation of receptors containing the NR2B subunit. Strong decreases in NR1 mRNA and protein were also observed during the reperfusion of infarcted rat brains. Given that the NR1 subunit is an essential component of the NMDAR, any modification of its expression will likely have a significant impact on receptor function. Our results thus reveal a new and important mechanism of autoregulation of the receptor by its agonist. Chemicals—The NMDAR antagonists 2-amino-phosphonopentanoic acid (DL-AP5) and ifenprodil were from Tocris-Cookson (Bristol, UK). NMDA, glutamate, glycine, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside, actinomycin D, poly-l-lysine, l-laminin, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) were all from Sigma. Carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (calpain inhibitor III, herein after referred to as CiIII) and 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA-AM) were from Calbiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Primary Neuronal Culture—Primary culture of embryonic rat neurons was essentially as described (28Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Methods Toxicol. 1993; 1A: 46-60Google Scholar) with some modifications. The plates were treated with poly-l-lysine (100 μg/ml) and laminin (4 μg/ml) overnight at 37 °C before seeding. Cerebral cortices from 18-day-old rat embryos (Wistar) were dissected and mechanically dissociated in culture medium (Eagle's minimum medium supplemented with 28.5 mm NaHCO3, 22.2 mm glucose, 0.1 mm glutamine, 5% fetal bovine serum, and 5% donor horse serum). The cells were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 105 cells/cm2 in the same medium. To inhibit growth of glial cells, cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to the culture at day 7 and maintained until the end of experiments. Experimental treatments were begun after 14 days in culture, at which time NR2A and NR2B subunits are both expressed. The following concentrations of reagents were used for pretreatments or treatments, as indicated under “Results”: 100 μm NMDA, 10 μm glycine, 100 μm glutamate, 200 μm DL-AP5, 10 μm ifenprodil, 10 μm CiIII, 40 μm BAPTA-AM, 2 mm EGTA, and 2.5 μg/ml actinomycin D. Excitotoxicity was always induced by combined treatment with either NMDA or glutamate and the co-agonist glycine. Assessment of Neuronal Injury—We used the MTT reduction assay to measure cell viability. MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the medium, and after 4 h at 37 °C the formazan salts formed were solubilized in 5 mm HCl containing 5% SDS and were spectophotometrically quantified at 570 nm. The contribution to the absorbance of glial cells in the mixed cultures was established by exposing sister cultures to 400 μm NMDA and 10 μm glycine for 24 h before MTT assay. These conditions induce nearly complete neuronal death but no glial damage. Once these values were subtracted, we calculated the viability of stimulated neurons relative to the untreated ones. Immunoblot Analysis—The cultures were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxicolate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm benzamidine). Brain samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as above. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA reagent from Pierce. Equal amounts of protein (25-50 μg) were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall; Life Sciences). Immunodetection of proteins was performed by standard procedures. NR1 expression was detected with an anti-NMDAR NR1 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies were used to detect neuronal specific enolase (NSE) (ICN Biomedicals) and conserved regions in the N terminus (Pharmingen) and C terminus (Chemicon, Temacula, CA) of NMDAR subunits NR2A and 2B. Protein loading was monitored by comparison with the staining with an anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Goat secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunocomplexes were detected with the Bioluminescence kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Densitometric analysis of bands was performed with NIH Image analysis software. Immunofluorescence—Primary cultures were grown on coverslips treated with poly-l-lysine and l-laminin as before. After stimulation with NMDA and glycine as indicated, they were fixed for 2 min at 4 °C in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), washed with PBS, and permeabilized for 2 min at -20 °C in methanol. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in 10% (v/v) horse serum, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and the same solution was used for antibody dilution. The cells were incubated with the monoclonal antibody for NR1 for 1 h at room temperature and, after washes, with an Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody for a further hour. Nuclear DNA was labeled with 2 μm TO-PRO 3 iodide (Molecular Probes) added to the secondary antibody solution. The coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech), and immunoreactivity was detected by examination under a Radiance 2000 confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) coupled to an inverted Axiovert S100 TV microcope (Zeiss) fitted with a 63× Plan-Apochromat oil immersion objective. Overlaying the NR1 and TO-PRO 3 images produced the two-color merged image. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were starved for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine or cysteine (Biowhittaker) and containing 200 μm DL-AP5. They were then labeled for 4 h with 150 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine + cysteine, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in RIPA buffer as before. When indicated, NMDA and glycine were present during starvation and labeling. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts in the extracts were measured, and equivalent counts were incubated with the following antibodies: anti-NR1 (2.5 μg); anti-NR2A/B (C-ter) (0.5 μg); or a rabbit polyclonal specific for calnexin (0.5 μl) (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada). The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 100 μl of 10% Protein A Sepharose (Sigma), and the beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer before solubilization in sample buffer. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared using TriReagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose gels prepared in 20 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, 0.6% formaldehyde. After transfer to nylon membranes, the RNA was hybridized to DNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 34-378 of rat β-actin cDNA or nucleotides 344-1280 of the NR1-1a splice variant, labeled by standard procedures. RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (10 units, Promega) to eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA and then extracted and precipitated. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry and checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Antisense riboprobes were prepared by in vitro transcription with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]CTP, by use of the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). The probe used for NR1 spans nucleotides 1250-1556 of the rat NR1 cDNA and corresponds to exons 7-9; that used for NR2A spans nucleotides 2442-2683 of the rat NR2A cDNA. As a loading control, we synthesized an antisense cRNA probe spanning nucleotides 196-357 of the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA. RNase protection assays were performed with the RPAII ribonuclease protection assay kit (Ambion). Total RNA from brain cortices or cultured neurons (15-20 μg) was hybridized to NR1 or NR2A probes together with GAPDH cRNA. Protected fragments were separated on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, which were dried and exposed to x-ray films. Quantitation was performed with a Packard Instantimager, and the values were normalized to those obtained for GAPDH. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA (2 μg) was transcribed in reverse by extension of random hexamers with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCRs (20 μl) contained 0.5 μl of cDNA, 0.05 units of Taq polymerase (Biotools), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 0.2 μm amplification primers, 1:40000 Sybr Green, and 3 mm MgCl2. The PCR was performed in a Rotor-Gene 2000 thermocycler (Corbett Research, Sidney, Australia). Denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min was followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 62 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The NR1 forward primer spanned nucleotides 1473-1493 of the cDNA (5′-TCCACCAAGAGCCCTTCGTG), and the reverse primer spanned nucleotides 1541-1561 (5′-AGTTCAACAATCCGAAAAGCTGA). The 108-bp region amplified by this primer set is common to all NR1 isoforms. NR1 transcript amplification was normalized against NR2A; the forward primer spanned nucleotides 1250-1270 (5′-ACGACTGGGACTACAGCCTG), and the reverse primer spanned nucleotides 1344-1364 (5′-CTTCTCTGCCTGCCCATAGC), amplifying a 134-bp region of the NR2A cDNA. Cell Transfection and Gene Reporter Assay—The plasmids pNRL5.4 (19Bai G. Zhuang Z. Liu A. Chai Y. Hoffman P.W. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 992-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and 356 (29Bai G. Kusiak J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7737-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Guang Bai, and contain, respectively, 5.4-kb and 356-bp sequences of the rat NR1 promoter cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. Plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) contains the SV40 early enhancer/promoter region in control of the constitutive expression of Renilla luciferase. Neurons cultured for 12 days were transfected plasmid DNA incorporated into Lipofectamine 2000 liposomes (Invitrogen). DNA-liposomes complexes were prepared in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), with the NR1 promoter plasmids in a 5:1 molar excess over pRL-SV40. Two hours after addition to cells, the liposomes were removed, and the neurons were fed with conditioned medium. In control experiments, the efficiency of transfection was estimated to be around a 15%. After transfection, the cells were maintained in culture for 40 h before experimental treatments. When indicated, the cells were pretreated for 2 h before stimulation with CiIII or with one of the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA-AM or EGTA. The cells were stimulated for the indicated times with NMDA/glycine, with or without DL-AP5 or ifenprodil. In the experiments with the Ca2+ chelators, after stimulation with NMDA/glycine for 1 h, the cells were washed, fed with conditioned medium plus DL-AP5, and analyzed 24 h later. Reporter gene activities were determined by the dual luciferase reporter assay system from Promega; firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla values obtained in the same sample. Animal Model of Cerebral Ischemia—All of the animal procedures were performed in compliance with European Community law 86/609/EEC and were approved by the ethics committee of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (275-300 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a solution of diazepam (5 mg/kg), ketamine hydrochloride (Ketolar, 62.5 mg/kg), and atropine (0.25 mg/kg). The femoral artery was cannulated for continuous monitoring of arterial pressure and blood sampling. Analysis of blood pH, gases, and glucose was performed before and 15 min after occlusion and 10 min after reperfusion. Body and brain temperatures were respectively maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C and 36 ± 0.5 °C during the whole procedure. The surgical procedure was a variant of that described by Chen et al. (30Chen S.T. Hsu C.Y. Hogan E.L. Maricq H. Balentine J.D. Stroke. 1986; 17: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (31Liu T.H. Beckman J.S. Freeman B.A. Hogan E.L. Hsu C.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: H589-H593PubMed Google Scholar). A small craniectomy was made over the trunk of the right middle cerebral artery and above the rhinal fissure, and the artery was transitorily ligated with a 9-0 suture just before its bifurcation into the frontal and parietal branches. Complete interruption of blood flow was confirmed by observation under an operating microscope. Then both common carotid arteries were also occluded, and all three arteries were kept this way for 60 min before reperfusion. After blood reperfusion for the indicated times, the animals were sacrificed by an inhaled overdose of halotane and decapitated. Sham-operated animals were subjected to anesthesia and surgical procedure but the occlusion of the arteries was omitted. For the protein extracts, the brain was sectioned into 2-mm-thick slices and stained with a 2% solution of triphenyltetrazolium chloride. The unstained area of the cerebral cortex (right hemisphere), defined as infarcted tissue, was dissected; the corresponding contralateral region in the left hemisphere was also dissected for comparison. To prepare RNA, dissection of the infarcted and contralateral cortical tissue was performed directly in whole brain, and the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use. For immunohistochemistry, 24 h after blood reperfusion, the rats were deeply anesthetized as before and perfused intracardially with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were removed immediately and post-fixed in the same fixative at 4 °C for an additional 24 h. They were then cryoprotected by serial immersion for at least 6 h in increasing concentrations of sucrose (10, 15, and 20%) in PBS at 4 °C. Frozen coronal sections (25 μm thick) were then prepared in a cryostat (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) and processed for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry—The infarcted tissue in the neocortex was identified by Nissl (0.1% (w/v) cresyl violet) staining of slide-mounted coronal sections. Adjacent sections were then processed for immunofluorescence. Briefly, the sections were permeabilized and blocked by treatment with 5% (v/v) sheep serum and 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. This same solution was used for antibody dilution; washes were performed in 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the NR1 monoclonal antibody (1:100). After several washes, the sections were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with the Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:400) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After further washes, the sections were counterstained for 1 h at room temperature with 2 μm TO-PRO 3 iodide (Molecular Probes) before mounting in Fluoromount-G solution (SouthernBiotech). Parallel controls without primary antibody showed very low levels of nonspecific staining. Confocal images were acquired as described above. Excitotoxic Activation of the NMDAR Down-regulates Expression of the NMDAR NR1 Subunit in Vitro—In this investigation, we have characterized the effect that activation of the NMDAR has on the expression of NR1, a critical subunit of this glutamate receptor. Primary cultured rat cortical neurons of 14 days in vitro were incubated with NMDA (100 μm) and the co-agonist glycine (10 μm), and steady-state NR1 protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody directed to an extracellular domain of this protein (Fig. 1A). Compared with untreated cells, there was a marked decrease in NR1 immunoreactivity after 8 h of agonist treatment. This effect was further accentuated by longer treatment, with NR1 protein nearly undetectable after 48 h. NMDA had no effect on the expression levels of the unrelated protein β-actin at any time tested. Immunofluorescence of primary cultures confirmed these results (Fig. 1B). In untreated cells (Fig. 1B, panel a), we observed a characteristic immunoreactivity for this protein in the cell soma and in clusters at puncta on dendrites (inset). Staining of nuclear DNA with TO-PRO 3 iodide revealed the presence in the primary cultures of glial cells, which do not express NMDAR proteins. Stimulation with NMDA and glycine for 8 h induced a marked decrease in the intensity of staining (Fig. 1B, panel b), both in cell bodies and dendrites. To exclude the possibility that the observed decrease was a consequence of neuronal cell death, we examined the expression of NR1 and other neuron-specific proteins at earlier times of treatment and measured neuronal viability by MTT assay. Immunoblot analysis was performed on neurons treated with NMDA from 30 min to 8 h (Fig. 1C), and the results from three independent experiments were quantified (Fig. 1D). Thirty minutes of NMDA stimulation were enough to significantly reduce NR1 band density by 29% compared with untreated cells (p < 0.01). By 4 and 8 h of treatment, NR1 band densities were, respectively, 43 and 71% below that from control cells (p < 0.01). In accordance with published results (25Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dong Y.N. Waxman E.A. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 11035-11045Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the NR2A and B subunits were cleaved, and a 115-kDa fragment recognized by an antibody specific for the N-terminal region of NR2A and NR2B appeared (Fig. 1C). However, after 8 h there was no statistically significant decrease in the combined levels of truncated and full-length NR2 proteins (Fig. 1D). There was similarly no significant decrease in the expression of NSE and β-actin. It thus seems that the NMDA-induced decrease in NR1 protein is not part of a general effect of neuronal death resulting from NMDAR activation, and this is further supported by the MTT assay, which estimated excitotoxic death to be only 25% after 8 h of NMDA treatment (Fig. 1D). However, the neurons in our cultures were committed to die, as shown by the progressive increase in neuronal death observed at later times of NMDA treatment (data not shown). NR1 Down-regulation by Brief Overstimulation of NMDARs Requires NR2B Subunits and Is Irreversible—To investigate the receptor components required for NR1 down-regulation, we first examined the effects of different NMDAR agonists and antagonists (Fig. 2A). Glutamate (100 μm in combination with 10 μm of the co-agonist glycine) decreased NR1 expression similarly to NMDA, and the specific competitive NMDAR antagon"
https://openalex.org/W2096981089,"General anesthetics are among the most widely used and important therapeutic agents. The molecular targets mediating different endpoints of the anesthetic state in vivo are currently largely unknown. The analysis of mice carrying point mutations in neurotransmitter receptor subunits is a powerful tool to assess the contribution of the respective receptor subtype to the pharmacological actions of clinically used general anesthetics. We examined the involvement of beta3-containing GABA(A) receptors in the respiratory, cardiovascular, hypothermic, and sedative actions of etomidate and propofol using beta3(N265M) knock-in mice carrying etomidate- and propofol-insensitive beta3-containing GABA(A) receptors. Although the respiratory depressant action of etomidate and propofol, as determined by blood gas analysis, was almost absent in beta3(N265M) mice, the cardiac depressant and hypothermic effects, as determined by radiotelemetry, and the sedative effect, as determined by decrease of motor activity, were still present. Taken together with previous findings, our results show that both immobilization and respiratory depression are mediated by beta3-containing GABA(A) receptors, hypnosis by both beta3- and beta2-containing GABA(A) receptors, while the hypothermic, cardiac depressant, and sedative actions are largely independent of beta3-containing GABA(A) receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2104745259,"This study was designed to evaluate the effects of hypokinesia and hypodynamia on cytoskeletal and related protein contents in human skeletal muscles. Twelve proteins: dystrophin and its associated proteins (DGC), dysferlin, talin, vinculin and meta-vinculin, alpha-actinin, desmin, actin, and myosin, were quantitatively analyzed during an 84-day long-term bedrest (LTBR). The preventive or compensatory effects of maximal resistance exercise (MRE) as a countermeasure were evaluated. Most of these proteins are involved in several myopathies, and they play an important role in muscle structure, fiber cohesion, cell integrity maintenance, and force transmission. This is the first comparison of the cytoskeletal protein contents between slow postural soleus (SOL) and mixed poly-functional vastus lateralis (VL) human muscles. Protein contents were higher in VL than in SOL (from 12 to 94%). These differences could be mainly explained by the differential mechanical constraints imposed on the muscles, i.e., cytoskeletal protein contents increase with mechanical constraints. After LTBR, proteins belonging to the DGC, dysferlin, and proteins of the costamere exhibited large increases, higher in SOL (from 67 to 216%) than in VL (from 32 to 142%). Plasma membrane remodeling during muscle atrophy is probably one of the key points for interpreting these modifications, and mechanisms other than those involved in the resistance of the cytoskeleton to mechanical constraints may be implicated (membrane repair). MRE compensates the cytoskeletal changes induced by LTBR in SOL, except for gamma-sarcoglycan (+70%) and dysferlin (+108%). The exercise only partly compensated the DGC changes induced in VL, and, as for SOL, dysferlin remained largely increased (+132%). Moreover, vinculin and metavinculin, which exhibited no significant change in VL after LTBR, were increased with MRE during LTBR, reinforcing the pre-LTBR differences between SOL and VL. This knowledge will contribute to the development of efficient space flight countermeasures and rehabilitation methods in clinical situations where musculoskeletal unloading is a component."
https://openalex.org/W2073818145,"Male- and female-specific isoforms of the Doublesex (DSX) transcription factor regulate somatic sexual differentiation in Drosophila. The isoforms (DSXM and DSXF) share an N-terminal DNA binding domain (the DM motif), broadly conserved among metazoan sex-determining pathways.

Broad conservation of the DM domain in metazoan proteins related to sexual differentiation suggests that mechanisms of sexual dimorphism are in part universal (3Raymond C.S. Shamu C.E. Shen M.M.

The C-terminal domains of DSXF and DSXM (CTDF and CTDM) are conserved among insect homologs. The domains contain a common dimerization element and sex-specific extensions proposed to mediate recruitment of transcriptional co-regulatory factors (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Garrett-Engele C.M. Siegal M.L. Manoli D.S. Williams B.C. Li H. Baker B.S. Development. 2002; 129: 4661-4675PubMed Google Scholar). The strength of dimerization (as inferred from DNA binding) is <1 nm (9Cho S. Wensink P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11301-11308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such dimerization enhances specific DNA binding (9Cho S. Wensink P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11301-11308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); a mutation in CTDF that blocks dimerization is associated with intersexual development (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J.

Wensink P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this article we describe the crystal structure of a dimeric fragment of CTDF at 1.6 Å resolution and its scanning mutagenesis in a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. The polypeptide (designated CTDF-p) spans residues 350–412 and so contains both shared and sex-specific sequences. Surprisingly, the structure reveals a novel dimeric arrangement of ubiquitin-associated-domain (UBA) folds (Protein Data Bank code 1ZV1). To our knowledge, this α-helical motif, although widely conserved among pathways regulating DNA repair and subcellular trafficking, has not previously been found in a transcription factor. Dimerization is mediated by an extensive non-polar interface conserved among DSX homologs. The structure of CTDF-p extends the family of transcription-related α-helical dimerization elements and raises the possibility that the ubiquitination machinery participates in the regulation of sexual dimorphism. Protein Crystallization—CTDF-p (65 residues; GS followed by DSXF residues 350–412) was designed based on Y2H studies (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10An W. Cho S. Ishii H. Wensink P.C. Mol. Cell.

Li B. Weiss M.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For selenomethionine labeling, the protein was expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 50 mg/liter selenomethionine and all other amino acids (except methionine) at 40 mg/liter (11Bayrer J. Wan Z. Li B. Weiss M.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained by hanging-drop vapor-diffusion in 4-μl drops containing equal volumes of protein stock (12 mg/ml) and reservoir buffer (1.8 m ammonium sulfate and 7% 2-propanol). Data Collection and Structure Determination—Native data were collected at Advanced Photon Source beamline 14BMC at 100 K. Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data were collected at NSLS beamline X9B at the selenium peak (0.9788 Å). Data collection statistics are given in TABLE ONE. Data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Substructure determination and phasing were accomplished with the SHELX suite of programs (13Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1990; 46: 467-473Crossref Scopus (19198) Google Scholar). Initial model building employed Warp/ARP (14Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Substitutions were introduced into plasmids by PCR mutagenesis (20Narendra U. Zhu L. Li B. Wilken J. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43463-43473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing. pGADT7- and pGBKT7-CTDF variants (residues 350–427) were co-transformed in pairs into yeast strain Y187 by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method. Cells were plated on SD/-Leu/-Trp minimal medium supplemented with 80 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal). Expression levels were verified by Western blot using anti-Gal4 antibodies (Upstate Group, Charlottesville, VA). β-Galactoside activity in colonies was monitored on X-Gal indicator plates and measured in cell extracts by o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactose assay. Overview of Structure—The crystal structure of the CTDF-p (residues 350–412) was determined at a resolution of 1.6 Å. Representative electron density is shown in Fig. 2A. Values of R and Rfree (20.8 and 25.7%, respectively) in part reflect disorder of the N- and C-terminal segments. 6The N- and C-terminal five residues of each protomer exhibit neither complete disorder nor two or more well defined conformations, resulting in uninterpretable positive Fo - Fc density. Refinement statistics are limited by either omission of these residues from the model or their inclusion in an approximate model with high thermal factors. NMR studies provide evidence for corresponding segmental disorder in solution (J. R. Bayrer, Y. Yang, and M. A. Weiss, unpublished results). The N-terminal five residues of CTDF-p (including two residues derived from thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein) are omitted from the model. The structure exhibits good stereochemistry, with 94% of non-Gly, non-Pro residues occupying the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and the remaining 6% occupying the additionally allowed region. No residues are observed in generously allowed or disallowed regions. The structure of CTDF-p forms an ellipsoidal dimer with protomers oriented head to tail (Fig. 2B). Each protomer contains three α-helices and exhibits a UBA fold. Residues 350–352 are not well ordered. Helical segments are 353–367 (α1), 371–384 (α2), and 388–407 (α3). The second helix exhibits a kink at Pro-375 (red in Fig. 3), separating subsegments α2A (371–374) and α2B (red cylinder); α2A forms a 310 helical turn (green cylinder in Fig. 4A). Residues 384–387 comprise a type I′ β-turn; the turn at 367–371 is non-canonical. Substantial hydrophobic contacts, characteristic of a UBA fold, occur between α1 and α2 and in part by α3 (see residues Leu-363, Met-377, and Ile-395 in Fig. 3B and Fig. 5, A and B). The surface of α3 contains (i, i+3) and (i, i+4) salt bridges from Glu-390 to Arg-393 and Arg-394 (Fig. 6A). The female-specific sequence begins midway through α3 (398–407); residues 408–412 are disordered. Despite limited sequence homology (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S4), structural alignment of a CTDF-p protomer with 18 UBA domains yields a mean pairwise root mean square deviation of 1.7 Å (range 1.2–2.3 Å) among main-chain atoms (Fig. 4B); the mean base-line pairwise root mean square deviation among these 18 domains is 1.3 Å. The root mean square deviation between CTDF-p and a related CUE domain (green in Fig. 4B; Ref. 21Kang R.S. Daniels C.M. Francis S.A. Shih S.C. Salerno W.J. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I.

One protomer is shown in blue, and the other is in teal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each protomer contains a small hydrophobic core centered about the side chains of Met-377 and Cys-360 (Fig. 5A). Although this “mini-core” contains residues from each of the three helixes, the predominant contribution is from α2. The side chains of Met-374, Met-377, and Leu-381 (α2) project opposite Cys-360, Leu-363, and Leu-364 (α1) and also interact with Ala-391 and Ile-395 (α3). Additional contacts occur between α1 and α3 as Leu-363 packs against Ile-388, Ala-391, and Ile-395 (α3). One side of the mini-core is sealed in part by interactions Lys-366—Ser-392 and Lys-366—Glu-389 (Fig. 5B); the remaining surfaces participate in dimerization (next paragraph). Novel Dimer Interface—Dimerization is mediated by helices α2 and α3 (Fig. 2B). Whereas α1 and α3 define the surface of the dimer, α2 and α2′ pack at the interface; they are parallel and nearly perpendicular to α3 and α3′. Packing between α2 and α2′ exhibits “knobs in holes” complementarity (Fig. 3C). 24 residues in each protomer define an extensive interface; the core is non-polar (Leu-357, Tyr-369, Trp-371, Leu-373, Met-374, Pro-375, Leu-376, Tyr-378, Val-379, Ile-395, Gly-398, Val-401, and Val-402; supplemental Fig. S2). The overall interface juxtaposes concave and convex surfaces. The contact area of a protomer (1077 Å2) spans 29% of its total surface (green regions in Fig. 7, A and B); dimerization, thus, buries a combined surface of 2153 Å2. Hydrophobic packing is extended by intermolecular salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a bridging network of water molecules (Asp-354, Tyr-378, Lys-382, Asp-383, Arg-394, Glu-397, Gln-399, and Tyr-405; supplemental Fig. S2). Arg-394 participates in both intramolecular and intermolecular salt bridges (Glu-390 and Asp-383′ (primed residues numbers refer to dimer-related protomer); Fig. 6A); Glu-397 interacts with Tyr-378′ and Lys-382′ (Fig. 6B). Such interactions (and neighboring solvation) apparently offset the proximity of Asp-383 and Asp-383′. Minor α1-α3′ interactions are also observed (involving Asp-354, Leu-357, and Tyr-405′). The junction between sex-nonspecific and sex-specific portions of CTDF-p (G398) packs against α2′ across the dimer interface. This junction is a site of mutation (G398D) associated with intersexual development (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overall structure is comprised predominantly of non-sex-specific residues and so is likely to be similar in CTDM. Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis—Y2H studies of variant domains were undertaken to test the contribution of interfacial side chains to dimerization (TABLE THREE). Bait and prey plasmids were constructed using the Gal4 system (Fig. 8A); photomicrographs of representative X-gal indicator plates demonstrate a range of β-galactosidase activities (white, light blue, and blue colonies; Fig. 8, B and C). A negative control was provided by G398D (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Colorimetric phenotypes of Y2H yeast colonies were in each case verified in cell extracts by quantitative β-galactosidase assays.TABLE THREEYeast two-hybrid analyses Substitutions were tested in the context of fragment 350–427; deletion of residues 413–427 does not affect activity (line 2).VariantSA aSA, solvent accessibility based on average of protomersY2HWild type+Δ413–427+G398DbControl mutation associated in vivo with intersexual development of XX flies and previously shown to block Y2H dimerization (7)0.00–P370A0.50–W371A0.42+P375A0.06–Y378A0.06–V379A0.00+/–I380A0.00–K382A0.51–D383A0.04+R394A0.12–I395A0.00–E396A0.59+/–E397A0.26+/–G398A0.00++Y400A0.68+V401A0.09+V402A0.05+/–N403A0.79+a SA, solvent accessibility based on average of protomersb Control mutation associated in vivo with intersexual development of XX flies and previously shown to block Y2H dimerization (7Erdman S.E.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab 17 Ala substitutions were tested; 3 substitutions in the core (Tyr-378, Ile-380, Ile-395) markedly impair β-galactosidase activity whereas 3 substitutions at the surface (W371A, Y400A, and N403A) yield no perturbations. Ala substitutions at three interfacial valines in α2 and α3 exhibit partial (Val-379 and Val-402) or full (Val-401) activity; the resulting packing defects may be offset by the higher helical propensity of Ala. R394A (expected to disrupt inter- and intramolecular salt bridges) and K382A (expected to disrupt a dimer-specific charge-stabilized hydrogen bond) markedly impair activity. E396A and E397A are partially tolerated, whereas D383A has no effect. Interestingly, the two prolines, although not features of canonical UBA or CUE domains, appear essential. G398A enhances β-galactosidase activity, presumably by stabilizing α3. Putative Ub Binding Surface—A putative Ub binding surface (inferred based on known monomeric UBA and CUE domains; gold surface in Fig. 7A) does not overlap with the dimer interface of CTDF-p (green surface). It is, thus, possible that the CTDF-p dimer presents two Ub-binding sites, one on each side. Heteronuclear NMR titration experiments suggest weak binding of the domain to Ub at protein concentrations >100 μm (supplemental Fig. S1). Alignment of one protomer with CUE2 as bound to Ub (21Kang R.S. Daniels C.M. Francis S.A. Shih S.C. Salerno W.J. Hicke L. Radhakrishnan I. Cell. 2003; 113: 621-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) yields a model of a complex between Ub and the CTDF-p dimer (Fig. 4C). This model suggests that potential UBA-Ub salt bridges are conserved: Asp-18 and Asp-40 of CUE2 align with Glu-365 and Glu-389 of CTDF-p. The model also permits a second Ub molecule to bind to the other protomer. We, thus, envisage that such a dimeric UBA fold could enable bidentate recognition of a poly-Ub chain. The CTDs of DSX enhance DNA recognition by providing a strong dimer contact (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10An W. Cho S. Ishii H. Wensink P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cho S. Wensink P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3185-3189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the monomeric DM domain itself can bind DNA sites as a cooperative dimer (4Zhu L. Wilken J. Phillips N.B. Narendra U. Chan G. Stratton S.M. Kent S.B. Weiss M.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1750-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Narayana N. Hua Q.-X. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 635-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the CTDs enhance specific DNA binding by 35-fold (9Cho S. Wensink P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11301-11308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The biological importance of CTD dimerization is suggested by a mutation in CTDF (G398D) that blocks dimerization in association with intersexual development (7Erdman S.E. Chen H.J. Burtis K.C. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1639-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of CTDF-p demonstrates that dimerization is mediated by a UBA-domain fold, previously unrecognized due to the absence of detectable sequence homology. The stability of the DSXF dimer (Kd 10-10 m; Ref. 9Cho S. Wensink P.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11301-11308Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reflects formation of an extensive hydrophobic interface flanked by intersubunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. The intersexual mutation G398D would insert an uncompensated charge into this interface. The CTD dimer, thus, extends to the realm of transcription the repertoire of UBA dimerization, previously implicated in cell-cycle control (24Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and receptor trafficking (25Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 7It is not known whether the structural mechanisms of such UBA homo- and heterodimerization resemble that of CTDF-p. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the structure of a dimeric UBA fold. 8The present structure is unrelated to the low affinity CUE dimer (Kd 1 mm) formed by domain swapping (supplemental Fig. S2; Ref. 41Prag G. Misra S. Jones E.A. Ghirlando R. Davies B.A. Horazdovsky B.F. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2003; 113: 609-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As discussed in turn below, this structure represents a novel class of helical dimerization domains, rationalizes results of mutagenesis, and suggests a possible role for Ub in sex determination. Small α-helical dimerization elements are often observed in transcription factors, defining regulatory families (26Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Examples include the leucine zipper (Fig. 9A; Ref. 27Zhu B.Y. Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), the basic-region helix-loop-helix motif (Fig. 9B; Ref. 28Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar), and the canonical four-helix bundle as exemplified by Lac repressor (Fig. 9C; Ref. 29Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). These structures share with CTDF-p the use of parallel α-helices and extensive interhelical contacts. In many (but not all) cases such modular motifs can mediate both homo- and heterodimerization and so enable combinatorial gene regulation (30Calkhoven C.F. Ab G. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the prototypical bZIP transcription factor GCN4 forms only homodimers, for example, mammalian homologs (including proto-oncoproteins Fos and Jun) form networks of interacting proteins. UBA domains can likewise form homo- and heterodimers (24Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Davies G.C. Ettenberg S.A. Coats A.O. Mussante M. Ravichandran S. Collins J. Nau M.M. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although DSX itself forms stable homodimers and is not known to form heterodimers with homologous DNA-binding proteins, it would be of interest should a family of UBA-containing transcription factors in Drosophila or other organisms be found to exhibit analogous combinatorial regulation. It is also possible that the DNA binding activity of DSX or related factors can be repressed through formation of an inactive UBA-mediated heterodimer. Proof of principle is provided by molecular genetic studies of transgenic flies in which non-native DSXF-DSXM heterodimers with altered gene regulatory properties are envisaged (32Waterbury J.A. Jackson L.L. Schedl P. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1653-1667PubMed Google Scholar). The present structure rationalizes the results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis (TABLE THREE), indicating that dimerization requires steric complementarity at a hydrophobic interface and is further stabilized by flanking salt bridges. Similar features stabilize the coiled-coil structure of leucine zippers (27Zhu B.Y. Zhou N.E. Kay C."

Biochemical experiments indicate that the basic functional unit of EmrE is a dimer where the common binding site for protons and substrate is formed by the interaction of an essential charged residue (Glu14) from both EmrE monomers. Previous studies implied that other residues in the vicinity of Glu14 are part of the binding domain. Alkylation of Cys replacements in the same transmembrane domain inhibits the activity of the protein and this inhibition is fully prevented by substrates of EmrE. To monitor directly the reaction we tested also the extent of modification using fluorescein-5-maleimide. While most residues are not accessible or only partially accessible, four, Y4C, I5C, L7C, and A10C, were modified at least 80%. Furthermore, preincubation with tetraphenylphosphonium reduces the reaction of two of these residues by up to 80%. To study other essential residues we generated functional hetero-oligomers and challenged them with various methane thiosulfonates. Taken together the findings imply the existence of a binding cavity accessible to alkylating reagents where at least three residues from TM1, Tyr40 from TM2, and Trp63 in TM3 are involved in substrate binding.

EmrE, a protein from Escherichia coli, provides a unique model for the study of polytopic membrane proteins. It is a small (110 residues) multidrug transporter that extrudes various positively charged drugs in exchange for protons, thus rendering bacteria resistant to these drugs (1Yerushalmi H.

Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48250-48256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previously, using site-directed mutagenesis of this TM1 face we identified a cluster of five amino acids that play a role in substrate and H+ recognition and/or translocation with substitutions at most positions yielding either inactive mutants or mutants with modified affinity to substrates (12Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Ninio S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

We now use Cys replacements in TM1 to study accessibility of the residues in TM1 to alkylating reagents and the effect of these agents on function. This method was first established to identify residues exposed to the aqueous translocation pathway of ligand-activated channels and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (14Xu M.

In several studies with ion-coupled transporters reactive residues were shown to be located in the vicinity of the binding site of the hydrophilic substrates (17Ye L. Jia Z. Jung T. Maloney P.C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Here we describe a combined approach where sensitivity of activity to alkylation is correlated with a direct quantitation of the exposure of the residues to alkylation. While most residues are not accessible or only partially accessible, some are quantitatively modified. Moreover, TPP+ and other substrates reduce modification at selected positions by more than 80% indicating that residues from each monomer in the functional unit are close enough to the binding site that substrate prevents their modification or they might be equivalently protected in an allosteric manner. The significance of these observations to a recent mechanistic model (20Ma C. Chang G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2852-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is discussed. A novel approach to study the effect on inactive mutants is described. The observations presented here allow for a tentative identification of residues in the substrate binding domain of EmrE. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli TA15 (21Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Richardson C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The plasmids used for EmrE expression are pT7-7 derivatives (22Tabor S. Richardson C.

Mutants Y4C, I5C, G8C, G9C, T19C, and L20C were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Except for Y4C, phenotype, binding, and transport properties of these mutants were essentially identical to those of wild type and will be described in detail elsewhere. The Y4C mutant binds TPP+ to levels practically identical to those of the wild type but does not transport and does not confer resistance against toxic cations. 3D. Rotem, S. Steiner-Mordoch, and S. Schuldiner, unpublished data. Expression and Isolation of Membranes—E. coli TA15 cells transformed with plasmid pGP1-2 and the appropriate pT7-7 derivatives were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium A supplemented with glycerol (0.5%), thiamine (2.5 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and kanamycin (50 μg/ml). When the culture reached an A600 = 0.9, it was transferred to 42 °C for 15 min to induce the T7 polymerase. Then the culture was shifted back to 30 °C, and 2 h later the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgSO4, and 15 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease (Sigma) and broken by French press. The membrane fraction was collected by ultracentrifugation at 240,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in the above buffer without dithiothreitol and without DNase. The membranes were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. TPP+Binding Assay—Binding of TPP+ was assayed essentially as described (4Muth T.R. Schuldiner S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Ni-NTA beads (20 μl/assay) (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) were washed twice in distilled water and once in buffer containing 0.08% dodecyl maltoside (DDM, Glycon Biochemicals GmbH, Luckenwalde, Germany), 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (DDM/Na-buffer). Membranes (0.2–1.0 mg protein/ml) were solubilized in 0.8% DDM/Na-buffer (15 min at room temperature) and incubated with the washed beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound material was discarded, and EmrE-His bound to beads was washed once with 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer and resuspended in 200 μl of the same buffer containing 5 nm [3H]TPP+ (27 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking. In each experiment, the values obtained in a control reaction, with 25 μm unlabeled TPP+, were subtracted. The reaction was stopped by pulse centrifugation. The bead fraction was then incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 450 μl of 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer containing 150 mm imidazole to release the EmrE His and [3H]TPP+ bound to it from the beads. After spinning down the beads, the [3H]TPP+-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. All binding reactions were performed in duplicates. Each experiment was performed at least twice. L7C was previously reported to be inactive in [3H]TPP+ binding (12Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but further experiments with higher amounts of protein demonstrated that it has a decreased affinity, 15-fold lower than that of wild type EmrE. When inhibition of binding was studied, experiments were performed with the following modifications: N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Sigma) and thiosulfonate derivatives (Anatrace Inc., Maumee, OH) such as 2-aminoethylmethanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) or sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethylmethanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) were added to the samples before the binding assay at the concentrations indicated. In the case of NEM, the reaction was stopped after 5 min by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to the final concentration of 5 mm prior to the addition of Ni-NTA beads. Where indicated, 25 μm TPP+ was added for 10 min before NEM incubation. NEM-fluorescein Labeling—Membranes from TA15 cells overexpressing the appropriate single Cys mutant were solubilized in 0.8% DDM/Na-buffer at 25 °C or in Na-buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 6 m urea at 80 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm to discard precipitates. NEM-fluorescein (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for 30 s (at 25 °C) for the DDM-solubilized protein and for 2 min (at 80 °C) for the protein solubilized in SDS. In some experiments substrates were added at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 25 °C before labeling with NEM-fluorescein. The reaction was stopped by dilution with the same buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol at a final concentration of 5 mm. The samples were then added to beads washed as described above and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 1 h. Unbound material was discarded and EmrE-His bound to beads was washed twice with 0.5% SDS, 6 m urea, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein was eluted from the beads using a buffer containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 450 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fluorescence labeling analysis of the gel was done using a Fujifilm LAS-1000 imaging system and digitally analyzed with Image Gauge 3.46 Fujifilm software. The results were calibrated to protein amount after staining of the same gels with Coomassie, scanning, and quantitation using the same software. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Formation of Mixed Oligomers—Membranes (60–100 μg) from cells expressing His-tagged Cys-less-Ala (CLA) EmrE E14C, G17C, Y40C, or W63C and membranes (320 μg) from cells expressing untagged CLA EmrE were mixed and solubilized at 80 °C for 15 min with at least 10 volumes of 0.8% DDM/Na-buffer as described (8Rotem D. Sal-man N. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48243-48249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The extract was centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 rpm to discard precipitates. Methane thiosulfonates (1 mm MTSEA and MTSET and 2 mm MTSES) were added 10 min before addition of washed Ni-NTA beads (20 μl of beads/assay) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The unbound material was discarded, and EmrE-His bound to beads was washed three times with 0.08% DDM/Na-buffer. Binding activity was tested as described above. To test the extent of reaction with the methane thiosulfonates the beads were incubated with SDS-urea and reacted with NEM-fluorescein, and labeling was evaluated as described above. Previously, using site-directed mutagenesis we identified a cluster of five amino acids in TM1 that may play a role in substrate and H+ recognition and/or translocation (12Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This was based on the fact that substitutions at the five positions yielded proteins that could not confer resistance to any of the substrates of EmrE. When tested further one mutant was found incapable of substrate binding (Gly17), three (Leu7, Thr18, and Ile11) bound it with a decreased affinity, and one (Ala10) displayed a modified affinity to H+ and, as a consequence, was impaired in the coupling of the proton gradient to substrate fluxes (12Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Here we use site-directed chemical modification of the cysteine substitutions to further probe the role of the above residues in binding substrate. Alkylation of Selected Residues in TM1 Inhibits Activity and Substrate Prevents the Effect—First we tested the effect of NEM, a small alkylating agent, on the ability of Cys substitutions in TM1 to bind TPP+, a substrate of EmrE that binds with high affinity. In these experiments, detergent-solubilized EmrE mutants were treated with NEM, immobilized on Ni-NTA beads, and assayed for their ability to bind TPP+ relative to the untreated protein. As shown in Fig. 1B, after treatment with 1 mm NEM, TPP+ binding of three of the Cys mutants is inhibited. Binding by L7C and A10C is inhibited more than 90%, while binding by I11C decreases to about 50% of the value in the absence of NEM. To further characterize the inhibition at these positions we tested the dependence on NEM concentration (Fig. 1C). The binding activity of both L7C and A10C is very sensitive to the modification, and 50% inhibition is observed at about 3 and 10 μm, respectively. The activity of I11C decreases also at low concentrations of NEM but rapidly levels off, and maximal inhibition is 50% even at 1 mm NEM. Interestingly, these three residues are three of the five residues identified in our studies using site directed mutagenesis. The other two residues (G17C and T18C) display very low activity even in the absence of NEM. The effect on T18C is unique as a reproducible 40% increase in the ability to bind TPP+ is detected after reaction with NEM (Fig. 1B). Since the evidence supports an involvement of the three residues in substrate binding we tested whether alkylation can be affected by preincubation with substrates. TPP+ prevents the inhibitory effect of NEM almost completely (Fig. 1D). The concentrations required for protection of activity are shown in Fig. 1D; practically full (80%) protection is detected at 2.5 μm for A10C, about 10 μm for L7C, and roughly 20 μm for I11C. Accessibility of Cys Substitutions in TM1 to NEM-fluorescein—The results presented above supply us with an important insight on the residues that may play a role in substrate binding. To find out whether the residues in both monomers are reacting and whether other residues are reacting without effect on the activity, we tested the accessibility of the Cys substitutions to NEM-fluorescein, an alkylating reagent that can be easily detected after reaction with the protein. In these experiments, detergent-solubilized EmrE mutants were allowed to react with NEM-fluorescein. After purification using metal-chelate chromatography, the protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of fluorescence associated with it was quantitated. A representative result is shown in Fig. 2A where the fluorescence of NEM-fluorescein-labeled E14C (lanes 1–3) and A10C (lanes 4–6) protein is shown. The E14C protein solubilized in DDM did not react with NEM-fluorescein either in the absence or in the presence of substrate (lanes 2 and 3, respectively), but it reacted after the protein was denatured by solubilization with SDS and urea and heating at 80 °C for 2 min (lane 1). These findings demonstrate that Cys at position 14 is not accessible and/or reactive when the protein is solubilized in DDM but becomes accessible after the protein is unfolded by denaturation. On the other hand, the A10C protein was labeled to the same degree whether solubilized in DDM (lane 5) or in SDS-urea (lane 4). When the reaction was carried out after preincubation with substrate (TPP+,25 μm), the modification was practically fully prevented (lane 6). These findings demonstrate that A10C is accessible to the same degree whether solubilized in a functional form with DDM or denatured after harsh treatment with SDS-urea and high temperature. The harsh denaturation conditions were essential for a full exposure of the Cys residues at all positions. Without heating or urea some mutant proteins were only partially accessible/reactive supporting again the notion that EmrE is a very well packed and stable protein (data not shown). A protocol similar to that described in the legend to Fig. 2A was carried out with all the mutants in TM1, and the results are shown in Figs. 2B and 3. In Fig. 2B, the fluorescence intensity of the label incorporated to the DDM-solubilized protein is shown as a percent of the intensity incorporated to the SDS-urea-treated protein. Cys residues at positions 4, 5, 7, and 10 are fully accessible to the reagent. At positions 6, 11, 12, and 17 about 40–60% of each residue react, while at the other positions tested (8Rotem D.

Most of the fully accessible ones are in the same face of the helix as Glu14. The effect of substrate on the accessibility to NEM-fluorescein was tested and the results are shown in Fig. 3. In these experiments a high concentration of substrate is used so its effects are detectable even with those residues that display low affinity. Substrate has no detectable effects on labeling of the three residues at the N terminus (Y4C, I5C, and Y6C). Notably, substrate dramatically reduces the level of labeling of L7C and A10C, two of the most accessible ones. Also some of those that are only partially accessible display a significant degree of protection. Remarkably, T18C displays an increased exposure upon addition of TPP+ (Fig. 3A), ethidium, and acriflavine (data not shown). To further analyze the effect of substrates on the alkylation reaction some of the residues were further investigated. The results in Fig. 3B show the concentration dependence of the protective effects of substrate. Similarly to what we showed above for the effect on activity, concentrations below 1 μm almost fully (∼85%) protect the alkylation of A10C (a mutant with a high affinity to TPP+), and higher concentrations are needed to fully protect about 80% of the labeling of L7C, a mutant with a lower affinity to TPP+. In the case of G17C, a mutant with a very low affinity (KD >100 nm), the behavior is quite different; a very small protection of about 20% is detected at 1–2 μm TPP+, and it does not further increase even at 25 μm TPP+. Labeling of Y4C, I5C, and Y6C (only the latter is shown) is not affected by substrate suggesting that, although exposed to NEM, they are not in the binding domain. As mentioned previously, the accessibility of T18C is increased by substrate. The dependence on the substrate concentration shown in Fig. 3B may reflect previous findings that the affinity of T18C to TPP+ is lower than that of the wild type or A10C (12Gutman N. Steiner-Mordoch S. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16082-16087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further probe the phenomenon of protection from labeling, the effect of other substrates was tested. Representative results are shown in Fig. 3C for the effect on labeling of A10C with two substrates: ethidium bromide and acriflavine. Both reduce more than 80% the level of labeling at concentrations of 50–100 μm, well in line with the fact that the affinity of EmrE to these substrates is lower than that to TPP+.FIGURE 3Substrate protects accessible residues from NEM-fluorescein labeling.A, NEM-fluorescein (0.5 mm) was added at 25 °C to the EmrE mutants after they were incubated with 25 μm TPP+ for 10 min. The results are shown as percentage of NEM-fluorescein labeling in the same mutant in the absence of TPP+. B, different concentrations (0–25 μm) of TPP+ were added for 10 min at 25 °C, prior to labeling with NEM-fluorescein of the mutants Y6C (▪), L7C (•), A10C (▴) G17C (▾), and T18C (♦). C, ethidium bromide (•) and acriflavine (▪) were added to the A10C mutant before labeling with 0.5 mm NEM-fluorescein.

The Cys replacement at position 14 is inaccessible to alkylation (Fig. 2, A and B). The conclusions that can be reached with this mutant are limited by the fact that it is completely inactive, and we therefore do not know whether it is correctly folded. However, we have shown previously that mixing with a wild type protein can functionally complement the inactive mutant and generates a hetero-oligomer that binds TPP+ in a mode that suggests that the functional properties of the dimer are a result of the interaction between individual monomers (7Elbaz Y.

https://openalex.org/W2069061056,"20 S RNA virus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The viral genome encodes only its RNA polymerase, p91, and resides in the cytoplasm in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex with p91. We succeeded in generating 20 S RNA virus in vivo by expressing, from a vector, genomic strands fused at the 3′-ends to the hepatitis delta virus antigenomic ribozyme. Using this launching system, we analyzed 3′-cis-signals present in the genomic strand for replication. The viral genome has five-nucleotide inverted repeats at both termini (5′-GGGGC... GCCCC-OH). The fifth G from the 3′-end was dispensable for replication, whereas the third and fourth Cs were essential. The 3′-terminal and penultimate Cs could be eliminated or modified to other nucleotides; however, the generated viruses recovered these terminal Cs. Furthermore, extra nucleotides added at the viral 3′-end were eliminated in the launched viruses. Therefore, 20 S RNA virus has a mechanism(s) to maintain the correct size and sequence of the viral 3′-end. This may contribute to its persistent infection in yeast. We also succeeded in generating 20 S RNA virus similarly from antigenomic strands provided active p91 was supplied from a second vector in trans. Again, a cluster of four Cs at the 3′-end in the antigenomic strand was essential for replication. In this work, we also present the first conclusive evidence that 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses are independent replicons. 20 S RNA virus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Therefore, 20 S RNA virus has a mechanism(s) to maintain the correct size and sequence of the viral 3′-end. This may contribute to its persistent infection in yeast. We also succeeded in generating 20 S RNA virus similarly from antigenomic strands provided active p91 was supplied from a second vector in trans. Again, a cluster of four Cs at the 3′-end in the antigenomic strand was essential for replication. In this work, we also present the first conclusive evidence that 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses are independent replicons. Positive strand RNA viruses encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in their genomes and utilize them to synthesize viral RNA in conjunction with other viral or host proteins (1Buck K.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1996; 47: 159-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antigenomic (negative) strand RNA is an intermediate of replication and serves as a template to synthesize progeny positive strands. Because viral replication takes place within the host cell and because there are plenty of cellular RNAs in these cells, the viruses must find efficiently not only the positive strands but also the negative strands during replication. Therefore, both the positive and negative strands bear cis-acting signals for replication, including those necessary to interact with the polymerase machinery. To analyze and characterize these signals, it is essential to develop appropriate in vivo or in vitro systems in which changes in the signals can be tested. 20 S and 23 S RNAs are positive strand RNA viruses found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and belong to the genus Narnavirus (2Wickner R.B. Esteban R. Hillman B.I. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E. Estes M. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M. McGeoon D. Pringle C. Wickner R.B. Virus Taxonomy: Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Academic Press, Inc., New York2000: 651-656Google Scholar). These viruses were initially identified as RNA species induced in cells under nitrogen starvation conditions (3Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most laboratory strains carry 20 S RNA, and fewer strains harbor 23 S RNA along with 20 S RNA. They are compatible in the same host cell. Because all known strains that carry 23 S RNA also carry 20 S RNA, it has not been clear whether 23 S RNA virus can replicate without 20 S RNA virus. Typical of fungal viruses, they are not infectious and have no extracellular pathways of transmission. They are transmitted horizontally through mating or vertically from mother to daughter cells. No curing methods to eliminate these viruses from yeast are known so far. Furthermore, 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses do not confer any phenotypic changes on the host. This makes their genetic manipulation difficult. The 20 S and 23 S RNA genomes are small (2514 and 2891 nucleotides, respectively), and each RNA encodes only a single protein: a 91-kDa protein (p91) and a 104-kDa (p104), respectively (5Rodríguez-Cousiño N.

Both proteins contain four amino acid motifs well conserved among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (9Esteban R. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban L.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 155-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When yeast cells are grown at 37 °C, the cells accumulate double-stranded RNAs called W and T (10Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the double-stranded forms of 20 S and 23 S RNA genomes, respectively (8Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). They are not replication intermediates, but by-products (11Fujimura T. Solórzano A. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7398-7406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because these viruses do not have genes for capsid proteins, their genomes are not encapsidated into intracellular viral particles (12Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Instead, the RNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate RNA-dependent RNA polymerases at a 1:1 stoichiometry and reside in the cytoplasm (15Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The viral genomes lack poly(A) tails at the 3′-ends and have perhaps no 5′-cap structures (8Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), thus resembling degradation intermediates of mRNAs. How these viruses can survive as persistent viruses in the host cytoplasm without their RNA genomes being digested by exonucleases involved in mRNA degradation is therefore interesting. Recently, we succeeded in generating 23 S RNA virus in vivo from a vector containing the entire cDNA sequence of the viral genome (16Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using this launching system, we began reverse genetics to investigate cis-acting signals for replication in 23 S RNA virus. 20 S and 23 S RNA genomes share five-nucleotide inverted repeats at the 5′ and 3′ termini (5′-GGGGC... GCCCC-OH) (8Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The 23 S RNA genome contains a bipartite cis-signal in the 3′-region that consists of the cluster of the terminal four Cs and a mismatched pair of purines present in a stem structure adjacent to the 3′-end (17Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the 3′-terminal and penultimate Cs are dispensable for launching 23 S RNA virus, the generated viruses recover these Cs. This indicates that the virus has an efficient 3′-terminal repair mechanism(s). Subsequently, we found that the bipartite 3′-cis-signal for replication is also essential for formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivo with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p104 (18Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44219-44228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This indicates the importance of complex formation for 23 S RNA virus and suggests that p104 protects the viral 3′-ends from degradation by binding to the 3′-cis-signal. In this work, we describe the generation of 20 S RNA virus in vivo from a vector, a system similar to the one developed previously for 23 S RNA virus (16Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast to the previous work, however, we succeeded in producing 20 S RNA virus not only from positive strands but also from negative strands if, in the latter case, active p91 was provided in trans from a second vector. Using these systems, we modified the viral 3′-ends and found that the clusters of the 3′-terminal four Cs in both the positive and negative strands are 3′-cis-signals for replication. We also provide, for the first time, conclusive evidence that 23 S RNA virus does not require 20 S RNA virus for replication; thus, they are independent replicons. Strains and Media—20 S RNA negative strains 2928-4 and 2928-5 were obtained in this work (see Fig. 1) from strain 2928 L-A-o (a ura3 trp1 his3, 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA-o, L-A-o) (16Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These strains were used to analyze launching of 20 S RNA virus from plasmids. Cells were grown in rich YPAD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine sulfate, and 2% glucose) or synthetic medium deprived of tryptophan, uracil, or both (19Wickner R.B. Cell. 1980; 21: 217-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nitrogen starvation in 1% potassium acetate was performed as described previously (4Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Hybridization—Cells were broken with glass beads (15Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and RNA was extracted from cell lysates once with phenol and twice with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. RNA was separated on an agarose gel, blotted onto a neutral nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 20 S RNA or 23 S RNA positive or negative strand-specific probe (20Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We analyzed 5–10 independent transformants in each experiment. For the sake of simplicity, only a representative of each experiment is presented in the figures. Plasmids—The standard 20 S RNA virus-launching plasmid pRE740 contains the entire 20 S RNA cDNA sequence (2514 bp) downstream of the PGK1 promoter in a pI2 derivative (21Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) 4The abbreviations used are: HDV, hepatitis delta virus; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. antigenomic ribozyme was directly fused to the 3′-end of the 20 S RNA cDNA genome (see Fig. 2A). There are 42 nucleotides between the major transcription start site from the PGK1 promoter and the 20 S RNA sequence. Transcripts from this vector have 20 S RNA positive strand polarity. The template plasmid pRE805 is similar to pRE740, but the orientation of the 20 S RNA cDNA is reversed. Therefore, transcripts from the PGK1 promoter have the negative strand polarity of the viral genome. In addition, the TRP1 marker of this plasmid was disrupted at the unique EcoRV site by insertion of a 1.1-kb URA3 fragment. 20 S RNA positive and negative strand-specific probes were made by T7 and T3 runoff transcription from pRE449 predigested with appropriate restriction enzymes. pRE449 contains a 1262-bp BamHI-SmaI fragment (nucleotides 1253–2514) of the 20 S RNA cDNA sequence between the BamHI and SamI sites of the pBluescript KS+ vector (Stratagene). 23 S RNA positive strand-specific probes were made from plasmid pALI38 as described (15Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In vitro mutagenesis was performed as described (22Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All mutations introduced were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—To prove that 20 S RNA virus was generated from plasmids, a DNA fragment of 842 bp was amplified by RT-PCR from lysates using internal primers RE171 (5′-CGCTTCTGCGATCGTAGATG-3′) and ALI-3 (5′-TAAAACTGTATGCAGCAG-3′). The lysates were prepared from 20 S RNA virus-generated cells from which the launching plasmids had been cured or from cells containing endogenous 20 S RNA virus. In either case, the lysate was pre-treated with DNase I before RT-PCR. The RT-PCR products were then digested with SmaI and analyzed on agarose gels. 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE)—Total RNA isolated by launching plasmid-cured cells was poly(A)-tailed using poly(A) polymerase (Invitrogen). The poly(A)-tailed RNA was denatured with hydroxymethylmercuric hydroxide as described (23Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized using oligonucleotide RE156 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGAGGATCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). After cDNA synthesis, RNA was digested with RNase A, and the unincorporated primer was eliminated using a Sephadex G-50 mini spin column (Worthington). cDNA containing the 3′-ends of 20 S RNA positive strands was PCR-amplified for 30 cycles using Taq polymerase (Promega) and primers RE157 (5′-GACTCGAGTCGAGGATCC-3′) and PG6 (5′-CGAATCGTCGCCAGTAG-3′). For amplification of the negative strand 3′-ends, we used oligonucleotide RE157 and oligonucleotide RE233 (5′-GCGTCGAAAGACGACAGC-3′). The amplified products from positive strand 3′-ends were digested with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the pBluescript KS+ vector. In the case of negative strand 3′-ends, PCR products were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the pBluescript KS+ vector. 20 S and 23 S RNA Viruses Are Independent Replicons—23 S RNA virus can be generated in vivo from an expression plasmid containing the entire viral cDNA sequence. We wished to establish a similar launching system for 20 S RNA virus to carry out reverse genetics. However, most laboratory strains harbor 20 S RNA virus. During the course of 23 S RNA virus-launching experiments, we happened to obtain cells that had lost endogenous 20 S RNA virus. Strain 2928 L-A-o was transformed with the standard 23 S RNA-launching plasmid pRE637 (16Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When transformants were analyzed, all of them generated 23 S RNA virus from the plasmid, and one of them (transformant 1) had apparently lost its endogenous 20 S RNA virus (Fig. 1A). We eliminated the launching plasmid from transformant 1 by isolating single colonies on nonselective YPAD agar plates. When the plasmid-cured colonies were analyzed, we found two types of segregants; the majority of colonies (10 of 12) contained only 23 S RNA virus generated from the plasmid, and the rest harbored neither 20 S nor 23 S RNA virus. Both types of segregants retained the genetic markers of the original strain. The segregants carrying 23 S RNA virus maintained the virus stably and did not produce virus-free colonies anymore. This suggests that the loss of endogenous 20 S RNA virus preceded the generation of 23 S RNA virus from the launching plasmid. We confirmed the curing of 20 S RNA virus in these segregants by three criteria. First, we did not detect 20 S RNA by Northern blotting (Fig. 1B). Even when the gels were overloaded, we found no signal for 20 S RNA. The conditions used should have allowed us to detect 20 S RNA if the virus were present at as low as one copy/cell. Second, we could not amplify 20 S RNA cDNA from the lysates of these cells by RT-PCR (data not shown). Finally, as will be shown below, we could generate 20 S RNA virus tagged with a silent mutation from a launching plasmid using these 20 S RNA-negative segregants as hosts. We confirmed that the virus retained the mutation and was not the result of amplification of any residual endogenous 20 S RNA virus. Generated 20 S RNA virus could be maintained stably and was also induced normally under nitrogen starvation conditions in these cells. Therefore, the 20 S RNA-negative segregants have no genetic defects to harbor 20 S RNA virus. We designated segregants 4 and 5 shown in Fig. 1B as 2928-4 and 2928-5, respectively. These segregants showed the same doubling time as the original strain, and we noticed no phenotypic changes in them. Strain 2928-5 carries only 23 S RNA virus derived from plasmid pRE637, but no 20 S RNA virus. Strain 2928-4 harbors none of the narnaviruses and can be used successfully as a host to generate 23 S RNA virus from the 23 S RNA-launching plasmid (17Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that some industrial yeast strains (Saccharomyces diastaticus) appear to harbor only 23 S RNA-like molecules (24López V. Gil R. Carbonell J.V. Navarro A. Yeast. 2002; 19: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), these results are the first conclusive evidence that 23 S RNA virus does not require 20 S RNA virus for replication. Therefore, 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses are independent replicons. Launching of 20 S RNA Virus from Expression Plasmids—We constructed a launching plasmid (pRE740) to generate 20 S RNA virus in yeast by inserting the entire 20 S RNA cDNA sequence (2514 bp) downstream of the constitutive PGK1 promoter (Fig. 2A). Positive strands of 20 S RNA can be transcribed from the promoter. To generate transcripts in vivo with the precise viral 3′-end sequence at the 3′ termini, an 82-nucleotide HDV antigenomic ribozyme cDNA sequence (25Perrota A.T. Been M.D. Nature. 1991; 350: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was directly fused to the 3′-end of the 20 S RNA sequence. The plasmid has the TRP1 gene as a selectable marker. We transformed strains 2928-4 and 2928-5 with pRE740. Transformants were transferred to 1% potassium acetate to induce 20 S RNA, and the RNA was extracted from the induced cells. By Northern hybridization, we detected single-stranded 20 S RNA positive strands in all of the transformants. The amounts of positive strands among them were similar (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4). We also found small amounts of W, the double-stranded form of 20 S RNA, in all transformants. Furthermore, we detected single-stranded 20 S RNA negative strands with a negative strand-specific probe (data not shown). These results indicate that 20 S RNA negative strands are synthesized from the positive strand transcripts in vivo and suggest the generation of 20 S RNA virus from the plasmid. To confirm this, we took two experimental approaches. First, we cured the plasmid from the transformants by isolating single colonies in nonselective YPAD agar plates. More than 70% of the plasmid-cured colonies retained 20 S RNA virus. Once generated, the virus replicated autonomously and could be maintained stably in the cells for >100 generations (so far examined) in the absence of the plasmid. The generated virus could be induced under nitrogen starvation conditions, and the viral RNA could be seen directly by ethidium bromide staining on agarose gels. The amount of induced RNA and the positive/negative strand ratios were similar to those found in endogenous 20 S RNA virus. We did not notice any effect of 23 S RNA virus on the efficiency of 20 S RNA virus generation (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). Second, we introduced a unique SmaI site into the 20 S RNA cDNA sequence in pRE740 by changing the T at position 1476 to G (numbered from the 20 S RNA 5′-end) (Fig. 2C). This marking did not alter the amino acid sequence of the encoded p91 protein. We transformed strains 2928-4 and 2928-5 with the SmaI-tagged plasmid. Transformants from both strains generated 20 S RNA virus. After curing the plasmid, RNA was extracted from both strains, and an 842-bp 20 S RNA cDNA fragment encompassing the SmaI site was amplified by RT-PCR. We also amplified the 842-bp fragment from endogenous 20 S RNA virus present in the original 2928 L-A-o strain as a control. As shown in Fig. 2C (lower panel), the amplified cDNA fragment from generated 20 S RNA virus in strain 2928-4 (lane 1) or 2928-5 (lane 2) was completely digested with SmaI, whereas the control from endogenous 20 S RNA virus was fully resistant to the enzyme (lane C). Therefore, these results demonstrate that 20 S RNA virus was generated from the launching plasmid and also confirm that the host strains 2928-4 and 2928-5 do not carry any endogenous 20 S RNA virus. p91 Is Essential—20 S RNA encodes a single protein, p91. p91 has the four amino acid motifs well conserved among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. When one of the motifs (460GDD462) was changed to 460EFD462 in the launching plasmid, the modified vector failed to produce 20 S RNA virus (Fig. 2B, lane 5), indicating that active p91 is essential for replication. The presence of 23 S RNA virus in the host could not rescue the modified plasmid to generate 20 S RNA virus (data not shown). This indicates that p104 encoded by 23 S RNA cannot substitute p91 for replication of 20 S RNA virus and is consistent with the fact that 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses are independent replicons. p91 and p104 share an eight-amino acid sequence (R(V/I)CGDDLI) surrounding the GDD motif with only one mismatch. When the mismatched amino acid (Val458) in p91 was replaced with Ile, thus making the stretch identical to the one found in p104, the plasmid with the modified p91 sequence produced 20 S RNA virus without any deleterious effects (Fig. 2B, lane 6). Previously, we found that 23 S RNA virus can also tolerate the reverse modification (Ile to Val) in the eight-amino acid sequence in p104 (16Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A Cluster of Four Cs at the 3′-End of the Positive Strand Is Essential for Replication—The transcription termination site for the FLP gene of the 2μ plasmid is located 0.7 kb downstream of the 20 S RNA genome in the vector (26Hartley J.L. Donelson J.E. Nature. 1980; 286: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). When the ribozyme GGG sequence 3′ to the cleavage site was substituted with AAA in the standard launching plasmid pRE740, the modified plasmid failed to generate 20 S RNA virus (data not shown). Therefore, it is important to generate transcripts in vivo with the precise viral 3′ termini for virus launching. 20 S RNA has five-nucleotide inverted repeats at both termini (5′-GGGGC... GCCCCOH). We examined the role of the 3′-terminal nucleotides of the 20 S RNA positive strand in replication by modifying each nucleotide with A in the vector. As shown in Fig. 3, changing the 3′-terminal or penultimate C did not affect the generation of 20 S RNA virus. On the contrary, a modification at the third or fourth C did not produce the virus. Therefore, the third and fourth Cs from the 3′-end are essential for replication. In good agreement, deletions of up to two Cs (but not three) generated 20 S RNA virus (Fig. 3) (data not shown). We were interested in the 3′-terminal sequences of 20 S RNA viruses generated from these modified vectors. We cured the launching plasmids from the cells, and the viral RNAs were isolated. The 3′-terminal sequences of these RNAs were then amplified by 3′-RACE, and 8–10 independently isolated clones were sequenced. As shown in TABLE ONE, the substitution of the terminal (pRE757) or penultimate (pRE758) C with A at the viral 3′-end was corrected to the wild-type C in the generated viruses. Furthermore, viruses launched from 20 S RNA cDNA lacking two Cs at the 3′-end (pRE759) recovered these nucleotides. Therefore, these results indicate that 20 S RNA virus, like 23 S RNA virus, has an efficient 3′-end repair mechanism(s) in vivo. The major transcription start site in the launching plasmid is located at position –42, relative to the 5′ terminus of the 20 S RNA genome. These extra nucleotides were not present in the generated viruses as judged from the 3′-sequences of the negative strands (TABLE ONE). We also added extra nucleotides between the 3′-end of 20 S RNA and the ribozyme sequence and examined their effects on virus launching. As shown in Fig. 3, the addition of a single U (lane 6), C(lane 7), or A (data not shown) did not affect the generation of 20 S RNA virus. However, the addition of a single G reduced virus launching (lane 8). Likewise, the addition of three Gs (lane 10), but not three Cs (lane 9), severely affected 20 S RNA virus generation. Extra Gs at the 3′-end reduced the efficiency of virus launching by severalfold as judged by counting virus-positive and virus-negative colonies after curing the plasmids. Once the plasmids were cured, however, the amount of 20 S RNA in the cells was similar to that generated from the wild-type cDNA without extra nucleotides at the 3′-end. We isolated viral RNA from plasmid-cured cells and analyzed the 3′-ends of the positive strands by 3′-RACE. As shown in TABLE ONE, the launched viruses examined eliminated the extra nucleotides present at the 3′-ends in the vectors. Therefore, these results clearly indicate that 20 S RNA virus has a mechanism(s) to correctly maintain the size and sequence of the 3′-end of the positive strand and is thus capable of repairing limited damage of the 3′-end.TABLE ONE3′-RACE: 3′-ends of viral RNA generated from positive strand mutantsLaunching plasmidaModifications of or extra nucleotides added at the 3′-end of the 20 S RNA positive strand in the launching vectors are underlined.ClonesPositive strandbExtra sequences found in the viral 3′-ends cloned are indicated by parentheses.ClonesNegative strandbExtra sequences found in the viral 3′-ends cloned are indicated by parentheses.pRE757 (...GCCCA-OH)87...GCCCC-OH33...GCCCC-OH1...GCC-OHpRE758 (...GCCAC-OH)87...GCCCC-OH32...GCCCC-OH1...GCCCC(G)-OH1...GCCCC(G)-OHpRE759 (...GCC_-OH)87...GCCCC-OH21...GCCCC-OH1...GCCCC(G)-OH1...GCCCC(G)-OHpRE794 (...GCCCCU-OH)97...GCCCC-OHNDcNot determined.1...GCCCC(G)-OH1...GCCCC(U)-OHpRE800 (...GCCCCG-OH)107...GCCCC-OHND1...GCCCC(C)-OH2...GCC-OHpRE795 (...GCCCCCCC-OH)107...GCCCC-OHND3...GCCC-OHpRE793 (...GCCCCGGG-OH)108...GCCCC-OHND1...GCCCC(G)-OH1...GCC-OHa Modifications of or extra nucleotides added at the 3′-end of the 20 S RNA positive strand in the launching vectors are underlined.b Extra sequences found in the viral 3′-ends cloned are indicated by parentheses.c Not determined. Open table in a new tab The Fifth G from the 3′-End in the Positive Strand Is Dispensable for Replication—When the fifth G from the 3′-end was changed to C (5G→ C, numbered from the 3′-end) in the vector, the modified plasmid failed to generate 20 S RNA virus (Fig. 4, lane 1), thus suggesting that this nucleotide is essential for replication. Alternatively, because the fifth G is part of a structure adjacent to the 3′-end, the inability of this plasmid to generate the virus may be a secondary effect due to a perturbation of the stem structure caused by the modification. Because the corresponding nucleotide in the 23 S RNA genome 3′-end is dispensable for its replication (17Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1981923272,"The NADPH-dependent dimeric flavoenzyme 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO) catalyzes Baeyer-Villiger oxidations of a wide range of ketones, thereby generating esters or lactones. In the current work, we probed HAPMO-coenzyme complexes present during the enzyme catalytic cycle with the aim to gain mechanistic insight. Moreover, we investigated the structural role of the nicotinamide coenzyme. For these studies, we used (i) wild type HAPMO, (ii) the R339A variant, which is active but has a low affinity toward NADPH, and (iii) the R440A variant, which is inactive but has a high affinity toward NADPH. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was used as the primary tool to directly observe noncovalent protein-coenzyme complexes in real time. These analyzes showed for the first time that the nicotinamide coenzyme remains bound to HAPMO during the entire catalytic cycle of the NADPH oxidase reaction. This may also have implications for other homologous Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases. Together with the observations that NADP+ only weakly interacts with oxidized enzyme and that HAPMO is mainly in the reduced form during catalysis, we concluded that NADP+ interacts tightly with the reduced form of HAPMO. We also demonstrated that the association with the coenzyme is crucial for enzyme stability. The interaction with the coenzyme analog 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AADP+) strongly enhanced the thermal stability of wild type HAPMO.

This coenzyme-induced stabilization may also be important for related enzymes. The interaction of proteins with small molecules, such as ligands and cofactors, often coincides with an increased stability of the protein due to the coupling of binding with the unfolding equilibrium (1Shrake A.

The importance of cofactor binding for protein stability is revealed for several flavoproteins (2Hefti M.H. Vervoort J. van Berkel W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4227-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The common polymorphism 677TC → T in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase causing the single point mutation A222V reduces the affinity of the enzyme for the FAD cofactor, resulting in a lower thermal stability (5Guenther B.D.

For the octameric protein vanillyl-alcohol oxidase, it was demonstrated that cofactor binding influences the quaternary architecture of the enzyme (7Tahallah N. Van Den Heuvel R.H.H.

The H61T mutant is purified as apo-enzyme and mainly exists as a dimeric species. The binding of FAD to the enzyme restores the octameric conformation (7Tahallah N. Van Den Heuvel R.H.H.

Similarly, for lipoamide dehydrogenase, it was shown that FAD binding increases the protein melting temperature from 35 to 80 °C (9van Berkel W.J. Benen J.A. Snoek M.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Coenzymes such as NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H can have, besides from their function in electron transfer, also a structural role. Several liver and pectoral muscle enzymes are substantially protected by NAD(P)+ against heat and proteolysis by trypsin (10Park I.K. Kim J.Y. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Phosphite dehydrogenase is stabilized by NAD+ (11Woodyer R. van der Donk W.A. Zhao H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11604-11614Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and DNA ligases become more compact upon anchoring coenzyme NAD+ (12Georlette D. Blaise V. Dohmen C. Bouillenne F.

In the present work, we have studied the noncovalent interactions between the oxidized or reduced nicotinamide coenzyme (NADP+ or NADPH) and the flavoenzyme 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase (HAPMO) 4The abbreviations used are: HAPMO, 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase;AADP+, 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate; BVMO, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase.. HAPMO from Pseudomonas fluorescens ACB is a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO), which converts a wide range of ketones into the corresponding esters or lactones (13Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. Van Der Ven J.G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The enzyme is also able to perform enantioselective sulfoxidations (14Kamerbeek N.M. Olsthoorn A.J. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In recent years, BVMOs have received increasing attention, representing a promising alternative for chemical oxidations reactions allowing highly selective oxygen insertion reactions (15Mihovilovic M.D. Rudroff F. Muller B. Stanetty P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 1479-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Alphand V. Carrea G. Wohlgemuth R. Furstoss R. Woodley J.M. Trends Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 318-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HAPMO is a so-called type I BVMO. These enzymes contain FAD as a cofactor and use NADPH as a source for electrons, whereas Type II BVMOs contain FMN and use NADH (17Willetts A. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 55-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Type I BVMOs contain two Rossman folds, which are involved in the binding of the ADP moieties of FAD and NADPH (18Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Together with bacterial N-hydroxylating monooxygenases and eukaryotic flavin-containing monooxygenases, type I BVMOs form a newly identified superfamily of flavoprotein monooxygenases (19Fraaije M.W. Kamerbeek N.M. van Berkel W.J.H. Janssen D.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which is distinct from the family of flavoprotein aromatic hydroxylases. Recently, the crystal structure of phenylacetone monooxygenase from Thermobifida fusca was solved (20Malito E. Alfieri A. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13157-13162Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This first structure of a type I BVMO revealed a two-domain architecture and highlighted the importance of an active site arginine, which seems critically involved in substrate oxygenation. Replacement of this conserved arginine in HAPMO (R440A) does not impair NADPH binding but results in complete enzyme inactivation (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). From site-directed mutagenesis, it was also established that Arg-339 and Lys-439 are involved in determining the coenzyme specificity of HAPMO. The R339A mutant showed a largely decreased affinity for NADPH, as judged from kinetic analysis and binding experiments. Saturation mutagenesis of Lys-439 suggested that this residue is involved in the binding of the 2′-phosphate of NADPH and allowed to change the coenzyme specificity of HAPMO in favor of NADH (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the proposed mechanism of action of BVMOs (22Sheng D. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11156-11167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After flavin reduction by NADPH and reaction with oxygen, the generated flavin C4a-peroxide attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate. After product formation, water is released from the resulting hydroxyflavin, regenerating the oxidized enzyme. For cyclohexanone monooxygenase, there is some indirect evidence derived from kinetic studies that the initially formed NADP+ remains bound during the substrate oxygenation process. In fact, release of NADP+ from the reoxidized enzyme is the last step to complete the catalytic cycle and is the rate-determining step in catalysis (22Sheng D. Ballou D.P. Massey V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11156-11167Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cyclohexanone monooxygenase does, however, not act on aromatic compounds and lacks the N-terminal domain of HAPMO. A similar kinetic mechanism has been proposed for pig liver flavin-containing monooxygenase (23Poulsen L.L. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6449-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that continued association of coenzyme is a recurrent theme for this class of monooxygenases, regulating enzyme activity. It has also been found for these monooxygenases that when no suitable substrate is present, the flavin C4a-peroxide will slowly decay to form hydrogen peroxide while releasing NADP+ (Fig. 1), thereby acting as an NADPH oxidase. The observed oxidase activity of HAPMO in the absence of an aromatic substrate is 0.1 s–1 (13Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. Van Der Ven J.G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which may suggest that also with HAPMO, NADP+ remains bound throughout the oxidative half-reaction. Kamerbeek et al. (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) do not address the issue of protein-coenzyme complexes present during the catalytic cycle. The suggested interaction may also be beneficial for the enzyme from a structural point of view. In this study, we aimed to gain mechanistic insight in HAPMO. For this, we selected wild type HAPMO and two HAPMO mutants (R339A and R440A). We used electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and size-exclusion chromatography as the principal tools to monitor coenzyme binding to HAPMO and its effect on protein stability. The major advantage of mass spectrometry is that it allows the direct observation of the noncovalent interactions between protein and ligand in real time even when a stoichiometric heterogeneous mixture is formed (24Fenn J.B. Mann M. Meng C.K. Wong S.F. Whitehouse C.M. Science. 1989; 246: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6378) Google Scholar, 25Heck A.J.R. van den Heuvel R.H.H. Mass Spectrom.

The data in this report have provided the first direct evidence that the nicotinamide coenzyme, either in its reduced or in its oxidized form, interacts with HAPMO throughout the catalytic cycle and stabilizes the enzyme to a great extent. Chemicals, Protein Expression, and Purification—NADPH, NADP+, and 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (AADP+) were obtained from Sigma. The hapE gene from P. fluorescens ACB encoding HAPMO was expressed in Escherichia coli strain TOP10 containing the vector pBADNK/hapE. The two genes encoding the mutant proteins R339A and R440A were generated as recently described (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For efficient expression, E. coli cells were grown at 20 °C with 0.002% (w/v) arabinose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin, essentially as described before (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Purification of wild type HAPMO and the R339A and R440A variants was performed as reported earlier (13Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. Van Der Ven J.G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nanoflow Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Enzyme samples for nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments were prepared in aqueous 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Wild type, R339A, and R440A HAPMO were introduced into a nanoflow electrospray ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass LCT, Waters, Manchester, UK) modified for high mass operation and operating in positive ion mode. For wild type HAPMO and variants, mass determinations were performed under conditions of increased pressure in the source and intermediate pressure regions in the mass spectrometer (Pirani gauge 7 milibars and Penning gauge 1.2 × 10–6 milibars) (27Schmidt A. Bahr U. Karas M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 6040-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Tahallah N. Pinkse M.W.H. Maier C.S. Heck A.J.R. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 15: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Nanoflow electrospray voltages were optimized for transmission of larger multimer protein assemblies (capillary voltage 1450–1650 V and cone voltage 100–125 V). For the mass determinations of NADPH, NADP+ and AADP+ electrospray voltages were optimized for transmission of smaller organic molecules (capillary voltage 1050–1150 V and cone voltage 30 V). Borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-Fil, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) were used on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) to prepare the nanoflow electrospray capillaries with an orifice of about 5 μm. The capillaries were subsequently coated with a thin gold layer (∼500 Å) by using an Edwards ScanCoat Six Pirani 501 sputter coater (Edwards High Vacuum International, Crawley, UK). For the kinetic experiments with NADPH, an automated chip-based electrospray source (Nanomate, Advion) was used. The automated source was programmed to aspirate 4 μl of sample into the conductive pipette tip and then to deliver the sample to the inlet side of the electrospray chip. This chip consists of 10 × 10 nozzles in a silicon wafer and a channel extending from the nozzle to an inlet side at the opposite face of the chip. Electrospray was initiated by applying an electric voltage of 1850 V, a head pressure of 0.2 p.s.i. to the sample in the pipette tip, and a cone voltage of 30 V. Analytical Procedures—The enzyme activity of HAPMO was spectrophotometrically determined by monitoring the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm (13Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. Van Der Ven J.G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 4-hydroxyacetophenone. The consumption of NADPH and formation of NADP+ in the absence of 4-hydroxyacetophenone was also monitored by mass spectrometry. The inhibition constant of NADP+ with respect to NADPH was determined spectrophotometrically with varying concentrations of NADP+. The thermal stability of wild type HAPMO and R339A and R440A variants was analyzed by enzyme inactivation studies and size-exclusion chromatography. HAPMO (10 μm) in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, was incubated at 36 °C in the absence or presence of FAD (200 μm) or AADP+ (50 μm). At various time points, aliquots were taken and analyzed for enzyme activity and hydrodynamical behavior. Analytical size-exclusion chromatography was performed by using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) by using 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. Aliquots of 100 μl were loaded on the column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Apparent molecular masses were determined by using a calibration curve made with standards from a molecular mass marker kit (Bio-Rad) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). Quaternary Structure of HAPMO Variants—Wild type HAPMO is a homo-dimeric flavoprotein with each monomer containing a noncovalently tightly bound FAD cofactor (13Kamerbeek N.M. Moonen M.J. Van Der Ven J.G. Van Berkel W.J.H. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To determine accurate masses of wild type, R339A, and R440A HAPMO and to investigate whether these proteins remain in their native form during ionization, the HAPMO variants (1 μm) were analyzed by nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8 (Fig. 2). As can be seen from Fig. 2A, ionization of wild type HAPMO revealed two major ion series around 4,500 and 6,000 mass-to-charge (m/z) corresponding to molecular masses of 77,610 ± 10 and 145,232 ± 21 Da, respectively (TABLE ONE). These species represent the monomeric and dimeric form of HAPMO, with the dimeric species being the dominant form. The molecular masses of the monomeric and dimeric form are in close agreement with the calculated masses including the FAD cofactors. Besides the native species containing two FAD molecules, small amounts of the dimeric apo-protein and dimeric protein with one FAD molecule were also observed. Thus, the mass spectrometry data showed the dimeric nature of HAPMO with tight binding of FAD.TABLE ONEMolecular masses deduced from the nanoflow electrospray mass spectra of each dimeric HAPMO variant in complex with FADEnzymeSpeciesCofactorAverage MrCalculated massaMass calculated on the basis of the primary sequence including the FAD cofactor.DaDaWild typeDimerFAD145,232 ± 21145,222R339ADimerFAD145,103 ± 43145,052R440ADimerFAD145,092 ± 44145,052a Mass calculated on the basis of the primary sequence including the FAD cofactor. Open table in a new tab Mass determination of R339A and R440A variants revealed molecular masses of 145,103 ± 43 and 145,092 ± 44 Da, respectively. Again, these molecular masses are in close agreement with the calculated masses of the dimers, including two FAD molecules (TABLE ONE). The HAPMO mutants were essentially present as holo-dimers, and only minor amounts of holo- and apo-monomer and apo-dimer were observed (Fig. 2, B and C). The mass spectrum of R440A revealed some more monomeric protein when compared with wild type and R339A HAPMO, which may indicate that in this particular HAPMO variant, the interaction between the monomers is somewhat weaker. Interestingly, in the electrospray process, the R339A mutant obtained fewer charges than wild type and R440A HAPMO. Whereas R339A yielded for the dimeric form a series of 21+ to 25+ ions for the dimeric form, both wild type and R440A yielded series of 23+ to 27+ ions. The observation that R339A obtains one charge less per monomer may indicate that the side chain of Arg-339 is exposed to solvent and is protonated in wild type enzyme, or alternatively, it may reflect that the mutation causes a small conformational difference. Complex Formation between Oxidized HAPMO Variants and NADP+ or AADP+—In the following, we aimed to monitor noncovalent HAPMO variant-nicotinamide coenzyme complexes present during the catalytic cycle. To study these protein-ligand interactions by mass spectrometry, we used NADP+ and the coenzyme analog AADP+. For these studies, we could not use NADPH as the reduced coenzyme would slowly react with oxidized HAPMO. AADP+ is a nonreducing coenzyme analog in which the amide function of the nicotinamide moiety is replaced by a primary amine function. This compound has often been used to probe coenzyme binding (29Cattani L. Ferri A. Boll. Soc. Ital. Biol. Sper. 1994; 70: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pelletier J.N. MacKenzie R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1900-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 31Mulrooney S.B. Williams Jr., C.H. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2188-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mixing the wild type enzyme (1 μm) with NADP+ (10 μm) and subsequent analysis by nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry did not reveal the presence of a complex between protein and NADP+. Only at a 5-fold higher concentration of coenzyme was some NADP+ binding observed (< 5% saturation/monomer). Weak binding of NADP+ to the oxidized enzyme was supported by UV-visible absorbance difference spectroscopy. The addition of 1.5 mm NADP+ to 10 μm HAPMO did not influence the absorption properties of the flavin cofactor, indicating that NADP+ does not bind, or at least not in the vicinity of the isoalloxazine ring. AADP+ is known to bind tightly to wild type HAPMO and R440A with dissociation constants of 0.4 and 0.1 μm, respectively (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Kamerbeek N.M. Janssen D.B. Fraaije M.W. Chapman S. Perham R. Srutton N. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Rudolf Weber, Berlin, Germany2002: 1005-1009Google Scholar). When we mixed wild type HAPMO (1 μm) with AADP+ (1 μm), we observed two new ion series in the mass spectrum (Fig. 3A). Deconvolution of these two ion series revealed molecular masses of 145,773 and 146,493 Da, strongly indicating the presence of dimeric protein in complex with one and two molecules of AADP+. Similarly, the mass spectrum of a mixture between R440A and AADP+ revealed complexes between protein and one and two molecules of AADP+ (Fig. 3B). The spectra clearly show that in an equimolar ratio, R440A was nearly saturated with AADP+, whereas wild type enzyme was saturated for about 30% with this coenzyme analog. Wild type HAPMO became fully saturated with AADP+ when the enzyme (1 μm) was mixed with a 4-fold excess of AADP+ (4 μm+) (data not shown). The mass spectra also indicated that AADP stabilizes the quaternary structure of wild type and R440A HAPMO as no apo-protein was observed when the coenzyme analog was bound. The R339A mutant, on the other hand, did not display significant binding of AADP+ (Fig. 3C). Even at a 10-fold excess of the compound, hardly any protein-AADP+ complex was formed (Fig. 3D). These results agreed well with earlier studies, which indicate that R339A only weakly interacts with AADP+. In summary, none of the oxidized HAPMO variants were able to bind specifically to NADP+, whereas wild type and R440A HAPMO, but not R339A, interacted strongly with the coenzyme analog AADP+. Complex Formation during NADPH Oxidation—The interaction between NADP+ and reduced HAPMO has not yet been analyzed because of the difficulties of directly observing these complexes. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry is an ideal direct method to characterize such interactions; however, it is difficult to preserve anaerobic conditions within the source of the electrospray ionization probe. Therefore, we monitored the binding of the nicotinamide coenzyme to the enzyme under aerobic conditions in the absence of ketone substrate. By measuring the redox state of the flavin cofactor during enzyme turnover, information can be obtained about the rate-limiting step in catalysis. These experiments have shown that under aerobic conditions and in the presence of sufficient NADPH, but in the absence of a ketone substrate, the flavin is mainly in a reduced form in both wild type and R440A HAPMO (100 and 97%, respectively), whereas in the R339A, most of the FAD is in the oxidized form. These results indicated that, at least in the wild type enzyme and R440A variant, flavin reduction is relatively fast (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the predominant enzyme form present during the reaction of substrate-free HAPMO with NADPH under aerobic conditions may be a complex of a reduced or oxygenated enzyme species and NADP+ (Fig. 1, right part of the cycle). This biochemical property allowed us to directly monitor the interaction between NADP+ and substrate-free reduced wild type and R440A HAPMO during turnover by mass spectrometry. In a typical experiment, we mixed 1 μm HAPMO enzyme with excess NADPH and measured noncovalent protein complex formation and the amounts of NADPH and NADP+ in real time up to 50 min at room temperature. First, we monitored the mass spectra of wild type HAPMO and R440A variant during incubation with 10 μm NADPH (Fig. 4, B and C). Upon mixing with NADPH, the mass spectrum revealed two new ion series, which corresponds with the binding of one and two molecules of the pyridine nucleotide to the dimeric species of wild type and R440A variants. Full saturation of the wild type enzyme and R440A variant with NADP(H) was not reached due to the relatively low concentration of NADPH used. Increasing the molar excess may, however, induce nonspecific complex formation. As the enzyme-bound flavin is mainly in the reduced or oxygenated state during steady-state conditions, the species we observed in the mass spectrum most probably reflected the reduced enzyme in complex with NADP+. Unfortunately, the high molecular mass of the HAPMO dimer did not allow us to differentiate between reduced, oxygenated, or oxidized HAPMO. For R339A, we did not observe any interaction between the protein and the nicotinamide coenzyme. Second, we analyzed the amounts of NADP+ and NADPH present during the HAPMO-mediated NADPH oxidase reaction. It should be noted here that by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, NADP+ is detected as the M+ ion (744 atomic mass units) as it has a fixed positive charge in the nicotinamide ring, whereas NADPH is detected as the [M + H+] ion (746 atomic mass units) (33Sulzenbacher G. Alvarez K. Van Den Heuvel R.H. Versluis C. Spinelli S. Campanacci V. Valencia C. Cambillau C. Eklund H. Tegoni M. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8807-8818Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It was found that under the experimental conditions used, a freshly prepared solution of NADPH contained about 8% of NADP+. However, no significant spontaneous further oxidation occurred within the time frame of the experiment. The enzyme-mediated oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ was evidenced by the fact that we observed an increase in the amount of NADP+ (744 atomic mass units) in time and a decrease in the amount NADPH (746 atomic mass units) (Fig. 5). Under the experimental conditions applied, wild type HAPMO oxidized about 70% of the added amount of NADPH within 50 min. The fact that the reaction did not reach completion can be attributed to product inhibition by NADP+. The R440A mutant did not oxidize NADPH. To validate the mass spectrometry data and to obtain some information about the binding site of NADP+ during turnover, we measured the inhibition behavior of NADP+ with respect to NADPH. For wild type enzyme, it was found that NADP+ behaves as a weak competitive inhibitor with a Ki of 390 μm. The relatively large difference in Km for NADPH (12 μm) (21Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Janssen D.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and Ki for NADP+ indicates that the oxidized enzyme is efficient in discriminating between the two states of the coenzyme. Furthermore, the fact that NADP+ competes with NADPH for binding is in line with the kinetic mechanisms that have been elucidated for sequence related monooxygenases (22Sheng D. Ballou D.P. Massey V.

In platelets, glucose uptake is mediated through GLUT3, which is present in plasma (15%) and intracellular α-granule (85%) membranes. Here we report the PKB-mediated glucose uptake by platelets by agents that do (thrombin) or do not (insulin) induce α-granule translocation to the plasma membrane. Both thrombin and insulin activate PKB and induce glucose uptake albeit with different kinetics. Inhibition of PKB by the pharmacological inhibitor ML-9 decreases thrombin-induced α-granule release and thrombin- and insulin-induced glucose uptake. At low glucose (0.1 mm), both agents stimulate glucose uptake by lowering the Km for glucose (thrombin and insulin) and increasing Vmax (thrombin). At high glucose (5 mm), stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin disappears, and insulin becomes an inhibitor of thrombin-induced glucose uptake via mechanisms independent of PKB. We conclude that in platelets glucose transport through GLUT3 is regulated by changes in surface expression and affinity modulation, which are both under control of PKB.

At resting conditions, ∼85% of GLUT3 is located intracellularly in α-granule membranes, whereas the remainder is present in the plasma membrane (PM) (2Heijnen H.F. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon platelet activation, GLUT3 containing α-granules fuse with the PM, and glucose uptake increases 2-fold (2Heijnen H.F. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J.

This implicates that under normal (∼5 mm glucose) and pathological conditions (up to 20 mm glucose) this transporter functions near saturation. GLUT1 is a ubiquitously expressed PM transporter with a Km for glucose of 29 mm, which is well above (patho-) physiological levels (10Hruz P.W. Mueckler M.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 11Nishimura H. Pallardo F.V. Seidner G.A. Vannucci S. Simpson I.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). GLUT3 belongs to the same subclass of facilitative glucose transporters as the insulin-responsive GLUT4 sharing a dual cellular location and a low Km for glucose (12Joost H.G. Bell G.I. Best J.D. Birnbaum M.J. Charron M.J. Chen Y.T. Doege H. James D.E. Lodish H.F. Moley K.H. Moley J.F. Mueckler M. Rogers S. Schurmann A. Seino S. Thorens B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E974-E976Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In L6 muscle cells, glucose uptake via GLUT3 and GLUT4 is stimulated by the serine-threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt kinase) (13Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Glucose transport by GLUT4 is determined by copy number at the PM and phosphorylation state, which affects its affinity for glucose (14Somwar R. Niu W. Kim D.Y. Sweeney G. Randhawa V.K. Huang C. Ramlal T. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46079-46087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of GLUT3. A key element in insulin-responsive tissues is insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), which controls the signal transduction pathways from the insulin receptor to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (15Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). In platelets, activation of IRS-1 induces binding of IRS-1 to the α2 subunit of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein) Gi (16Ferreira I.A. Eybrechts K.L. Mocking A.I.M. Kroner C. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 297: 3254-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This G-protein is under control of the purinergic P2Y12 receptor of ADP that supports platelet activation by thrombin by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and accumulation of cAMP, which is a potent platelet inhibitor (17Gachet C. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Schwarz U.R. Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The result of Tyr-phosphorylation of Giα2 is inactivation of the G-protein, preventing the decrease in cAMP and attenuating the mobilization of Ca 2+ ions and platelet aggregation (16Ferreira I.A.

An important signaling element in insulin-responsive tissues is PKB, which participates in insulin-induced glucose-uptake (15Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). Platelets contain the PKBα and PKBα isoforms that contribute to platelet aggregation (19Kroner C. Eybrechts K.L. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Animal models show that both PKB-subtypes are crucial for the formation and stabilization of a thrombus in an arterial injury model (20Chen J. De S. Damron D. Chen W.S. Hay N. Byzova T.V.

Invest. 2004; 113: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKB is a critical component of PI3K-supported platelet activation. The activity of PKB depends on its phosphorylation at Ser473/4 and Thr308/9 for PKBα and PKBα, respectively (22Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), and is finely regulated by PI3K-independent mechanisms that include Ca2+-sensitive protein kinase C (19Kroner C. Eybrechts K.L.

Jackson C.W. Gartner T.K. Blood. 2002; 99: 2442-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By analogy with insulin-responsive tissues one would expect that platelets respond to insulin with an increase in glucose uptake via a mechanism controlled by PKB. Up-regulation of glucose uptake requires an increase in surface expression of GLUT3 (2Heijnen H.F. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Sorbara L.R. Davies-Hill T.M. Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Horne M.K. Simpson J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because this process depends on the fusion of α-granule membrane with the PM, and because secretion depends on an increase in cytosolic Ca2+, one would expect that insulin supports secretion by enhancing Ca2+ mobilization. This appears not to be the case (16Ferreira I.A. Eybrechts K.L. Mocking A.I.M. Kroner C. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 297: 3254-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to understand the apparent contradiction in insulin responses inflicted in platelets. The results show that insulin indeed triggers PKB activation as well as glucose uptake despite its capacity to inhibit thrombin-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Whether insulin acts as an activator or inhibitor of PKB-mediated glucose uptake depends on the extracellular glucose concentration, which shifts the balance between activation and inhibition of platelets by insulin.

The ADP receptor P2Y12 antagonist AR-C69931MX was a kind gift from Astra Zeneca (Loughborough, UK). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Antibodies—We obtained antibodies for P-selectin (C-20), PKBa/b (Akt1/2), and the phospho-specific p-PKBα/β/γ (Akt1/2/3) Ser473/4 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); P-selectin/RPE (CD-62P) and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA); and rabbit anti-goat from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of Washed Platelets—All healthy volunteers claimed not to have taken any medication 10 days prior to blood collection. After obtaining informed consent, freshly drawn venous blood was collected into 0.1 volume of 130 mm trisodium citrate. Citrated blood was centrifuged (150 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and platelet-rich plasma was collected and used in part for Ca2+ measurements with Fura-2-AM (see below). For the preparation of washed platelets, platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with 0.1 vol of ACD (2.5% trisodium citrate, 1.5% citric acid, 2% glucose) and centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C). The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm Na2HPO4,1mm MgSO4,10mm HEPES, pH 6.5) containing 5 mm glucose. Then, 10 ng/ml PGI2 was added prior to a second centrifugation step (330 × g 15 min, 20 °C). The platelet pellet was resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer, pH 7.25, containing 5 mm glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Prior to the experiments, platelets were kept at 20 °C for 45 min to ensure a resting state. In some studies the following metabolic inhibitors were added (with the indicated preincubation times and final concentrations): BAPTA-AM (30 min, 10 μm); SQ22536, LY294002, or ML-9 (15 min, 100 μm); or cytochalasin B (30 s, 0.2 μg/ml); phloretin (30 s, 10 μm); or AR-C69931MX (30 s, 50 nm). Platelets were preincubated or stimulated with insulin (10 min, 100 nm) or thrombin (10 min, 0.25 unit/ml) at 20 °C, unless stated otherwise. Immunoblotting—Samples of washed platelets were collected in 3× sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets and blocked in 4% bovine serum albumin/TBST 0.1%. Blots were probed separately with the primary antibody p-PKBa/b/g Ser473/4 for PKB detection at 57 kDa. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. For analysis of lane loading, the blots were reprobed with anti-PKBα/α. Quantification of the bands was performed with ImageQuant-TL software (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—Incubations of platelets were stopped by placing aliquots of 100 μlin700 μl of Hepes/Tyrode buffer, pH 7.25, at different time intervals. Aliquots were preincubated with P-selectin/RPE (CD-62P) for 30 min, and samples were fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Fixed RPE-labeled platelets were analyzed in a FACScan (BD Biosciences, Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). The samples were gated for single platelets based on forward and side scatter profiles, and 10,000 events were recorded. The results were analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) and expressed as percentage of thrombin-induced P-selectin expression (set at 100%). Measurement of Platelet Aggregation—Aliquots of 0.5 ml of washed platelets were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min, followed by stimulation with 0.25 unit/ml thrombin. Platelet aggregation was monitored continuously for 7 min at 900 rpm in an optical aggregometer (model 570 VS, Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA).

To identify the distribution of GLUT subtypes the following degenerated oligonucleotide primers from conserved regions of human GLUT1, human and rat GLUT3, and human and mouse GLUT4 were designed: GLUT1, 5′-TCACTGTGCTCCTGGTTCTG-3′ (sense, positions human: 1489–1506) and 5′-CCTGTGCTCCTGAGAGATTCC-3′ (antisense, positions human: 1702–1721); GLUT3, 5′-AGTCGGTTGAAATGCTGAT-3′ (sense, positions human: 481–499 and rat: 428–446) and 5′-TAGAACACAGCATTGATCCC-3′ (antisense, positions human: 986–1006 and rat: 934–953); GLUT4, 5′-ATAGGAGCTGGTGTGGTC-3′ (sense, positions human: 1124–1141 and mouse: 986–1003) and 5′-GCAAATAGAAGGAAGACGTA-3′ (antisense, positions human: 1487–1506 and mouse: 1349–1368). The resulting PCR products were 233 bp for GLUT1, 526 bp for GLUT3, and 383 bp for GLUT4. The reaction was performed in 20 μl containing 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer II, 4 μlofMgCl2 (25 mm), and 0.2 μl of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl) from the GeneAMP kit obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), 1 μl of dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP of each 25 μm) obtained from Amersham Biosciences, 6.8 μl of distilled water (9.8 μl for GLUT1), 2 μl of both sense and antisense primers (10 μm; 1 μl of each primer for GLUT1), and 2 μl cDNA for GLUT3 and GLUT4 (1 μl for GLUT1). After heating at 94 °C for 2 min, amplification proceeded for 43 (GLUT1) or 40 (GLUT3/4) cycles, with denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing of primers for 1 min at 62 °C (GLUT1) or 56 °C (GLUT3/4), and extension for 1 min at 72 °C. This was followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min. After the RT-PCR, 10 μl of the products was separated on a 2% agarose gel for GLUT1 and a 1% agarose gel for GLUT3 and GLUT4. TaqMan-PCR—Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers and TaqMan probes were designed with Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers designed for GLUT1 and GLUT3 amplified a 62-bp amplicon and a 63-bp amplicon, respectively, spanning the exon 4-exon 5 junction of each sequence. Both TaqMan probes were labeled with 6-carboxifluorecein (FAM) as a reporter dye and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) as a quenching dye. The following primers were used: GLUT1 forward: 5′-CAT CGT CGT CGG CAT CCT-3′; GLUT1 reverse: 5′-CCT TGT TGC CCA TGA TGG A-3′; GLUT1 TaqMan probe: 5′-(FAM)-ATC GCC CAG GTG TTC-(TAMRA)-3′; GLUT3 forward: 5′-GGT GGC CCA GAT CTT TGG T-3′; GLUT3 reverse: 5′-CAG TAG CAG CGG CCA TAG C-3′; GLUT3 TaqMan probe: 5′-(FAM)-CTT CAG ACC CAA GGA TGA-(TAMRA)-3′. The relative expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in cDNA of the aforementioned megakaryocytic cell lines was determined by comparing the cycles at which the reporter dye fluorescence surpassed an arbitrary threshold. The same amount of cDNA was used in each PCR reaction. Uptake of [3H]DOG by Platelets—Washed platelets were resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer, pH 7.25, with or without 5 mm glucose, which is referred to as low and high glucose, respectively. Glucose uptake by platelets was initiated by addition of [3H]DOG in the indicated concentrations prior to or after treatment with insulin or thrombin as outlined in the “Results.” Glucose transport was stopped by adding 5 ml of stop buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, with 10 μm cytochalasin B) as described previously (2Heijnen H.F. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Sorbara L.R. Davies-Hill T.M. Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Horne M.K. Simpson J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min, 20 °C), and the supernatant was replaced by 5 ml of stop buffer. After three washing steps, the supernatant was replaced with 500 μlof0.1 m NaOH. The platelet pellet was dissolved overnight, and total protein content was determined to correct for variations in cell number. [3H]DOG uptake was determined in a liquid scintillation counter and expressed as arbitrary units (AU) defined as disintegrations per minute corrected for protein content (disintegrations per minute/μgof protein). Kinetic parameters for glucose transport were determined by a Hofstee plot with weighted linear regression analysis (30Hofstee B.H. Nature. 1959; 184: 1296-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Measurement of Ca2+ Mobilization—Platelet-rich plasma was preincubated with 3 μm Fura-2-AM (45 min, 37 °C, light-protected). After incubation, platelet-rich plasma was supplemented with acid-citratedextrose and prostaglandin I2, centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (pH 7.25) containing 5 mm glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded in 1.0-ml aliquots of platelets without additional Ca2+ at 20 °C in a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using oneway analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test as posttest for repeated measurements unless stated otherwise. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of five observations unless stated otherwise; ns indicates not significant. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. An asterisk indicates a significant difference with controls. ML-9 Inhibits Thrombin- and Insulin-induced PKB Phosphorylation—As illustrated in Fig. 1 (A and B), thrombin induced a rapid phosphorylation of Ser473/4 confirming earlier observations (19Kroner C. Eybrechts K.L. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, stimulation with insulinalsoinitiated thephosphorylationofSer473/4 illustratingthat,inaddition to inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization by interfering with P2Y12 signaling (16Ferreira I.A. Eybrechts K.L. Mocking A.I.M. Kroner C. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 297: 3254-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (93) Google Scholar), insulin has potential activating properties by triggering the activation of PKB. ML-9 is a diazepine derivative that has been shown to inhibit PKB phosphorylation in adipocytes and myoblasts without interfering with the upstream PI3K (32Fiory F. Oriente F. Miele C. Romano C. Trencia A. Alberobello A.T. Esposito I. Valentino R. Beguinot F. Formisano P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11137-11145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Conejo R. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that ML-9 also interfered with the phosphorylation of PKB Ser473/4 induced by thrombin and insulin and thereby with the activity of PKB (19Kroner C. Eybrechts K.L. Akkerman J.W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Hence, ML-9 is an effective inhibitor of PKB in platelets. PKB Regulates Surface Expression of P-selectin and Platelet Aggregation—Earlier studies showed that the uptake of glucose by platelets depends on an increase in GLUT3 surface expression that accompanies the secretion of α-granules (2Heijnen H.F. Oorschot V. Sixma J.J. Slot J.W. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Sorbara L.R. Davies-Hill T.M. Koehler-Stec E.M. Vannucci S.J. Horne M.K. Simpson J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To address the question whether PKB participates in the translocation of α-granules and thereby in the surface expression of GLUT3, the expression of P-selectin was measured, which is a second component of the α-granule membrane. There was a slight P-selectin expression on non-stimulated platelets, which was unaffected by ML-9. In thrombin-stimulated platelets, ML-9 (100 μm) reduced P-selectin expression by 37.3 ± 3.1% (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that PKB contributes to the secretion of α-granules thereby increasing surface expression of GLUT3. The secretion of α-granules is part of the release reaction that accompanies platelet activation by thrombin. A second secretion response is the extrusion of dense granule contents, leading to liberation of ADP that facilitates aggregation by signaling through the P2Y12 receptor (17Gachet C. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). ML-9 (100 μm) reduced thrombin-induced aggregation by 78 ± 13% (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus ML-9 was a better inhibitor of aggregation than of secretion suggesting that apart from indirectly modulating aggregation via ADP release, PKB directly participates in the regulation of the aggregation response. Glucose Transport Supports Platelet Aggregation—Apart from anaerobic and aerobic degradation of glucose as sources for resynthesis of metabolic ATP, platelets can maintain their energy content through oxidative phosphorylation of lipids (1Akkerman J.W.N. Holmsen H. Platelet Responses and Metabolism. II. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 189-213Google Scholar). To assess the importance of glucose uptake in aggregation, platelets were preincubated with cytochalasin B and phloretin, which inhibit glucose transport by interfering with the intra- and extracellular glucose binding sites, respectively. These treatments induced a 30% fall in aggregation responses, illustrating that glucose transport is necessary for optimal platelet aggregation (Fig. 3, A and B). GLUT Subtypes in Megakaryocytes—Platelets contain virtually all important elements of the insulin signaling pathway such as the insulin receptor, IRS-1, PI3K, and PKB. It is unclear if platelets contain GLUT4, which is the major glucose transporter under control of insulin. To address this issue, GLUT subtype distribution was determined by RT-PCR in the megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF, which represent different stages in the maturation of normal megakaryocytes (26Ogura M. Morishima Y. Ohno R. Kato Y. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H. Blood. 1985; 66: 1384-1392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Greenberg S.M. Rosenthal D.S. Greeley T.A. Tantravahi R. Handin R.I. Blood. 1988; 72: 1968-1977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Fugman D.A. Witte D.P. Jones C.L. Aronow B.J. Lieberman M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1252-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Degenerated oligonucleotide primers against conserved sequence regions in GLUTs were used together with cDNA from the megakaryocytic cell lines, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, Wistar rat brain, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The primer combinations resulted in amplification of products with the expected sizes for GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. All megakaryocytic cell lines expressed GLUT1 and GLUT3 mRNA. No message was found for GLUT4 in the megakaryocytic cell lines in contrast to the positive controls (Fig. 4). The ratio of GLUT1 and GLUT3 mRNA was measured in the megakaryocytic cell lines MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the TaqMan fluorogenic probe system. We observed 4.3 ± 0.2-, 2.6 ± 0.2-, and 13.2 ± 2.0-fold increases in GLUT3 mRNA in the MEG-01, DAMI, and CHRF cell lines, respectively, compared with GLUT1 mRNA (n = 3). These results suggest that platelets are deficient of GLUT4 and contain predominantly GLUT3. Glucose Uptake by Platelets in Medium with Low Glucose—To investigate the involvement of PKB in glucose transport, platelets were preincubated in medium containing either 0 mm glucose or 5 mm glucose (defined as low and high glucose, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2148120153,"Twenty-two amino acid residues from transmembrane domain 3 of the creatine transporter were replaced, one at a time, with cysteine. The background for mutagenesis was a C144S mutant retaining ∼75% of wild-type transport activity but resistant to methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents. Each substitution mutant was tested for creatine transport activity and sensitivity to the following MTS reagents: 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA), 2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET), and 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSES). Two mutants (G134C and Y148C) were inactive, but most mutants showed significant levels of creatine transport. Treatment with MTSEA inhibited the activity of the W154C, Y147C, and I140C mutants. Creatine partially protected I140C from inactivation, and this residue, like Cys-144 in the wild-type CreaT, is predicted to be close to a creatine binding site. MTSEA inactivation of Y147C was dependent on Na+ and Cl- suggesting that solvent accessibility was ion-dependent. Helical wheel and helical net projections indicate that the three MTSEA-sensitive mutants (W154C, Y147C, and I140C) and two inactive mutants (V151C and Y148C) are aligned on a face of an α-helix, suggesting that they form part of a substrate pathway. The W154C mutant, located near the external face of the membrane, was accessible to the larger MTS reagents, whereas those implicated in creatine binding were only accessible to the smaller MTSEA. Consideration of our data, together with a study on the serotonin transporter (Chen, J. G., Sachpatzidis, A., and Rudnick, G. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 28321–28327), suggests that involvement of residues from transmembrane domain 3 is a common feature of the substrate pathway of Na+- and Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporters.

Creatine is present at high concentrations in tissues with large and fluctuating demands for energy such as heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Creatine is converted to phosphocreatine by creatine kinase following ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Phosphocreatine is used to recycle ATP by reversal of this reaction at sites of high energy utilization. In mammals creatine is either obtained by synthesis from sequential reactions occurring in the kidney and liver or from the diet. Interestingly, tissues that contain high levels of creatine/phosphocreatine do not appear to synthesize their own creatine (1Wyss M. Kaddurah-Daouk R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1107-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). A specific uptake system for creatine was first identified in skeletal muscle (2Fitsch C.D. Shields R.P. Payne W.F. Dacus J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2024-2027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later shown to be present in various cultured cell preparations (3Daly M.M. Seifter S. Arch. Biochem.

The SLC6 family includes solute transporters for dopamine, serotonin, glycine, taurine, proline, betaine, a system B0+ cationic and neutral amino acid transporter (11Chen N.H. Reith M.E. Quick M.W.

The Na+- and Cl--dependent creatine transporter (SLC6A8) has been shown recently to be responsible for the absorption of creatine by intestinal epithelia (14Peral M.J. Garcia-Delgado M. Calonge M.L. Duran J.M. De La Horra M.C. Wallimann T. Speer O. Ilundain A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 545: 133-144Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and transport of creatine across the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers (15Ohtsuki S. Tachikawa M. Takanaga H. Shimizu H.

This is characterized by expressive speech and language delays, epilepsy, developmental delay, and autistic behavior (17Salomons G.S. van Dooren S.J. Verhoeven N.M. Marsden D. Schwartz C. Cecil K.M.

All members of the SLC6 family of transporters are predicted to consist of 12 membrane-spanning domains, a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth transmembrane domains containing sites for N-linked glycosylation, with the N and C termini facing the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In the absence of a three-dimensional structure, indirect approaches such as mutagenesis have been used to gain insight into the structure and function of SLC6 transporters. For example, Tyr-140 in TM3 of the GABA transporter (GAT-1) was found to be critical for substrate recognition and transport (19Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The functional importance and aqueous accessibility of amino acid residues in the TMs of transporters can be tested by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (20Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this approach, consecutive residues of a predicted TM domain are replaced by cysteine. Ionization of the sulfhydryl group is likely to happen if the introduced cysteine faces a water-accessible transport pathway. The resulting thiolate group reacts a billion-fold faster with polar MTS reagents than a free sulfhydryl, providing good selectivity for the reaction. Thus, reaction of an engineered cysteine in the transport pathway should alter binding or transport irreversibly and be reduced by the presence of an inhibitor or substrate (20Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The functional importance of residues in TM3 of the serotonin transporter (SERT) has been studied by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Replacement of Tyr-176 (equivalent to Tyr-140 of GAT-1) with cysteine resulted in a reduced affinity for serotonin and cocaine. An additional TM3 mutant, I172C, was readily inactivated by MTSET. Cocaine and serotonin protected the I172C SERT mutant from MTSET inactivation suggesting that Ile-172 is located in a permeation pathway close to the substrate binding site (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We found previously that exposure of Cys-144 in TM3 to low concentrations of MTSEA led to rapid inactivation of the CreaT (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Creatine was able to protect the CreaT from MTSEA inactivation suggesting that this residue is close to a substrate binding site. A C144S mutant retained ∼75% of the creatine transporter activity but was resistant to inactivation. To help define the transport pathway for creatine we have used this mutant as a background for the substitution of 22 residues in TM3 one at a time for cysteine and to test for sensitivity to MTS reagents. Mutagenesis—Mutant transporters were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the C144S CreaT mutant (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated cDNA was excised from pBluescript KS and subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The cDNA sequence of all CreaT mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The construction of wild-type bovine CreaT cDNA in pcDNA3.1+ has been described previously (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of Mutant CreaTs—HEK293 cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin, and penicillin and seeded at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well in 12-well (3.8-cm2 area) poly-l-lysine (Sigma, P1399)-coated plastic culture dishes (Falcon) 48 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of plasmid and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000™ per well following procedures recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For biotinylation experiments, cells were plated out at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in 6-well (9.6-cm2 area) poly-l-lysine-coated plastic culture dishes, and the transfection procedure was scaled up accordingly. Creatine Transport Assay—Cells expressing CreaT mutants were assayed for creatine uptake activity 24 h after transfection. Medium was removed from wells, and the cells were washed with 1 ml of prewarmed KRH (Krebs-Ringer-HEPES) uptake buffer. The KRH buffer contained 120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. The cells were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of KRH containing 20 μm [4-14C]creatine (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, ARC-176, 55 mCi/mmol, diluted to a specific activity of 1 mCi/mmol). After the incubation the uptake medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. Cells were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, and aliquots were taken for scintillation counting. Samples were also taken to determine protein concentration using a detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. All assays were carried out in triplicate. Treatment with MTSEA, MTSET, and MTSES—MTS reagents were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Ontario, Canada. Cells were incubated with 0.25 mm MTSEA, 1 mm MTSET, or 10 mm MTSES in KRH buffer for 5 min prior to creatine transport assays. Cells were washed once with 1 ml of KRH prior to assay. To study the kinetics of inactivation, cells expressing some mutants were incubated with MTSEA at the concentrations and times indicated under “Results” and in the legend for Fig. 4. In some cases cells were incubated with MTS reagents in the presence of creatine as indicated in the text. KRH buffer was prepared without Na+ (using N-methylglucamine) or without Cl- (using sodium glucuronate) to investigate the effect of these ions on MTSEA inactivation or creatine protection. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Cell surface expression of the transporters was determined using a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce), as described previously (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were purified on NeutrAvidin™ beads (Pierce) and extracted from the beads by adding 50 μl of 2 × SDS reducing buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubating for 1 h at 37°C followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The biotinylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with affinity-purified C-terminal-directed antibodies against the CreaT (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Transport Activity of Cysteine Mutants—Replacement of Cys-144 in TM3 (Fig. 1) of the bovine CreaT with a serine gives a mutant (C144S) that retains ∼75% of the activity of the wild-type CreaT but is resistant to treatment with 0.25 mm MTSEA, 1 mm MTSET, or 10 mm MTSES (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This mutant was used as a background to construct 22 cysteine replacement mutants. The transport activity of these mutants varied widely (Fig. 2A). Two mutants (G134C and Y148C) were inactive, and the activity of V151C was too low to study further. Three other mutants (A136C, Y147C, and W154C) had severely reduced activity (≤25% of C144S). Three mutants retained 25–50% activity, and 13 mutants had levels of activity ≥50% of C144S.FIGURE 2Activity and expression of cysteine substitution mutants. HEK293 cells were transfected with either empty pcDNA3.1+ (pc), the background mutant (C144S), or each of the 22 cysteine replacement mutants. A, cells were incubated with 20 μm [14C]creatine for 3 min. Uptake activity is shown as a percentage of C144S transport. The values represent the means ± S.D. of at least two experiments in triplicate. B, transfected cells were treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin to label cell surface proteins, and detergent-solubilized proteins were purified by adsorption onto NeutrAvidin™ beads. Samples of the biotinylated proteins were run on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and detected by Western blotting with anti-CreaT antibodies. The region of the gel containing the mature glycosylated ∼120-kDa band associated with cell surface CreaT is shown. The lines show the positions of 160-, 120-, and 100-kDa markers. To determine the relative expression of the cysteine mutants and the C144S background, this band was quantified by densitometry and the results normalized to the biotinylated band obtained from cells expressing WT CreaT run on the same SDS gels and Western blots. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of at least two separate biotinylation experiments for each mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Surface Expression of TM3 Mutants—To investigate whether variations in transport activity resulted from differences in cell surface expression, cells expressing each TM3 mutant were labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Biotinylated proteins were purified from cell lysates with NeutrAvidin™ beads and analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to the C-terminal region of the transporter. All of the cysteine mutants and the background C144S mutant showed the presence of a diffuse ∼120-kDa band corresponding to biotinylated CreaT (Fig. 2B, lower panel). This band was absent in cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 2B, lower panel, pc). The expression of the biotinylated ∼120-kDa band for each mutant was normalized relative to WT CreaT (Fig. 2B, upper panel). There was some variability in surface expression relative to the C144S background, although this did not correlate with levels of activity. It appears likely that differences in transport activity result from cysteine substitution rather than altered expression, folding, or trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane. Sensitivity of TM3 Mutants to MTS Reagents—To determine whether residues in TM3 were accessible to MTS reagents, all of the TM3 cysteine mutants in the C144S CreaT background were reacted with MTSEA and the larger MTSET (positively charged) and MTSES (negatively charged) reagents (Fig. 3). Three mutants (W154C, Y147C, and I140C) were inhibited to a significant extent (≥40%) by a 5-min treatment with 0.25 mm MTSEA, a concentration five times higher than required to inhibit WT CreaT (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). W154C was the only mutant inhibited by a 5-min treatment with 1 mm MTSET (76%) and 10 mm MTSES (70%), respectively. Reactivity with MTSET and MTSES appeared to be limited to residues predicted to be near the exterior end of TM3 (Fig. 1). To determine the relative reactivity of the W154C, Y147C, and I140C mutants, we determined the concentration dependence and time course of MTSEA inactivation. These data are compared with results from the WT CreaT and the background (C144S) and A136C mutants (Fig. 4). Increasing concentrations of MTSEA resulted in an exponential decrease in the activity of I140C, W154C, and WT CreaT. However, maximum inactivation of I140C (∼90%) and W154C (∼80%) required an ∼10-fold higher concentration of MTSEA than the WT CreaT required. The t1/2 for inactivation of WT CreaT was 0.47 ± 0.03 min with 50 μm MTSEA, and the t1/2 values for the I140C and W154C mutants were 0.81 ± 0.06 and 0.82 ± 0.12 min, respectively, with 0.5 mm MTSEA (Fig. 4B). The C144S background and the A136C mutants showed much smaller and apparently linear decreases in activity with increasing concentrations of MTSEA (Fig. 4A). Similar results were also obtained with other “non-reactive” mutants (M150C, V141C, G155C, N145C, and Y143C) from Fig. 3 (data not shown). We attributed the decline in creatine transport seen in these mutants to result from either slow reactivity of other cysteine residues in the CreaT or toxicity from the higher concentrations of MTSEA. We observed that MTSEA ≥1mm was toxic to HEK293 cells, resulting in the detachment of the cells from the culture dishes. The Y147C mutant exhibited a low level of transport activity that was partially sensitive (40–50% inactivation) to MTSEA (Fig. 4). We estimated a t1/2 for inactivation of 3.7 ± 0.12 min for this mutant with 0.5 mm MTSEA. However, the low activity and slow reactivity of this mutant, combined with difficulties in using higher concentrations of MTSEA, limited further analysis of this mutant. The data shown in Fig. 4B were used to determine the pseudo second order rate constants for the inactivation of WT CreaT (Cys-144), I140C, W154C, and Y147C as 29,760 ± 1302, 1688 ± 107, 1754 ± 205, and 388 ± 170 (min-1 m-1, mean ± S.E.), respectively. Effect of Na+, Cl-, and Creatine on the Sensitivity of Cysteine Replacement Mutants to MTSEA—Experiments with the WT CreaT confirmed previous work (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MTSEA inactivation was independent of Na+ and Cl-, whereas the ∼90% protection from inactivation by 1 mm creatine was reduced in the absence of these ions (Fig. 5). The background C144S was unaffected by MTSEA or the presence or absence of Na+, Cl-, or creatine. Inactivation of the I140C mutant (∼64%) by MTSEA was also not dependent on Na+ or Cl-. However, the partial protection from creatine (1 mm) was reduced by the absence of either ion. The concentration dependence for the protection by creatine from MTSEA inactivation was determined for both WT CreaT and I140C (Fig. 6). Approximately twice the concentration of creatine was required to protect I140C by 50% compared with the WT CreaT (KD values for creatine binding of 0.69 and 0.31 mm creatine, respectively). The Km values for creatine transport of I140C and WT CreaT were 0.212 and 0.079 mm, respectively (data not shown).FIGURE 6Comparison of the effect of creatine on MTSEA inactivation of WT CreaT and the I140C mutant. HEK293 cells, expressing WT CreaT or the I140C mutant, were incubated with 50 μm or 0.5 mm MTSEA, respectively, in the presence of the indicated concentration of creatine for 5 min, and the cells were washed and assayed for creatine transport activity. The results have been normalized with respect to the activity of WT CreaT and I140C treated with MTSEA in the absence of creatine. The results are the means ± S.E. of two separate determinations, each in triplicate. The KD values for creatine binding for the WT CreaT and I140C were 0.31 ± 0.05 and 0.69 ± 0.09 mm, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inactivation of W154C with MTSEA was independent of Na+ and Cl- and not protected by the presence of creatine, consistent with this residue being located away from the substrate binding site. In contrast to WT CreaT or other cysteine mutants, MTSEA inactivation of Y147C was dependent on Na+ and Cl-. Protection from inactivation by creatine (∼46%) was also reduced in the absence of either Na+ or Cl-. This suggests that solvent accessibility of Y147C is also ion-dependent. We have tested the functional importance and aqueous accessibility of amino acid residues in TM3 of the CreaT by the substituted cysteine accessibility method. An ideal starting point for this study would have been the engineering of a Cys-less protein with normal function (20Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the bovine CreaT contains 22 Cys residues, so it is unlikely that an active Cys-less mutant could be generated. We used a C144S mutant that retains 75% of wild-type activity and was known to be relatively resistant to MTS reagents as a background for the mutagenesis study (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although this proved valuable, there were some limitations to the use of this mutant. Exposure to increasing concentrations of MTSEA led to decreases in the activity of the background mutant. This may have occurred from reactivity of some of the remaining 21 Cys residues of the CreaT or toxicity because of modification of other proteins in the HEK293 cells. Experimentally, we were able to compensate for these difficulties by use of appropriate controls, relatively short (5 min) reaction times, and by limiting the concentration of MTSEA to ≤0.5 mm. Our study was able to define the boundaries and identify critical residues of a substrate pathway for creatine. The complete scanning mutagenesis of TM3 of the CreaT provides an important opportunity for comparison with a similar study of the SERT (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cysteine substitution mutants that are inactive in both transporters would indicate positions critical for a common function. The sequence of TM3 of the CreaT and the equivalent region of the SERT are compared in Fig. 7A. Conversion of Tyr-148 of the CreaT and Tyr-176 of the SERT to cysteine renders both transporters inactive. This agrees with the previous suggestion that this residue may be part of a substrate binding site (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the finding that even conservative mutations at this position (Tyr-140) of GAT-1 resulted in the loss of activity (19Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). V151C of the CreaT had no detectable activity, whereas the equivalent SERT mutant I179C retained 50–70% of the control activity. Although this indicates a difference between the two transporters, the SERT was found to be less tolerant to other mutations, such as replacement of this Ile with Ser or Ala (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Modification of I179C by MTSET was shown to inhibit transport activity but not substrate binding. It was suggested that Ile-179 is located in a conformationally sensitive region, closer to the external medium where its accessibility is increased by substrate binding (23Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Ile-155 in the norepinephrine transporter (equivalent to SERT Ile-179) was also present in a conformationally sensitive region of TM3 (23Chen J.G. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1044-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found G134C CreaT to be inactive. This residue is conserved in the SERT, but studies of mutants of this position have not been reported. There is good agreement that the position equivalent to Cys-144 of the CreaT and Ile-172 of the SERT is close to a substrate binding site (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). MTSET inactivation of I172C SERT was blocked by both serotonin and cocaine, and creatine protected the CreaT from MTSEA inactivation. Close proximity to the binding site is consistent with the size of the side chain at this position affecting substrate specificity in the CreaT. A C144L CreaT mutant had a higher Km for creatine and, unlike WT CreaT, was inhibited competitively by GABA (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The identification of Cys-144 as the residue modified by MTSEA is supported by the resistance of the CreaT mutants C144S and C144A (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and C144L 3J. R. Dodd and D. L. Christie, unpublished data. to MTSEA. Activity screening of CreaT cysteine replacement mutants following a 5-min treatment with 0.25 mm MTSEA showed substantial inactivation (≥40%) of the W154C, Y147C, and I140C mutants. The kinetics of MTSEA inactivation (concentration and time dependence) at these mutants was determined and used to determine their relative accessibility compared with the WT CreaT, where MTSEA reactivity is presumed to occur at Cys-144. Surprisingly, the reactivity as determined from the pseudo second order rate constants was ∼17 times greater for WT CreaT (Cys-144) than for I140C or W154C (29,760, 1688, and 1754 min-1 m-1, respectively). The rate constants for inactivation of I140C and W154C were similar to that determined for inactivation of the SERT (782 min-1 m-1) by MTSET (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, the apparent reactivity of Cys-144 appears to be greater than other solvent-accessible regions of TM3 of the SERT and the CreaT. The most likely explanation would be if the microenvironment of Cys-144 results in a lower pKa value for this cysteine. The ionized thiolate group is known to react much faster than SH-groups with MTS reagents (20Javitch J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 331-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Experiments on the protection by creatine from MTSEA inactivation revealed some differences between the CreaT and the SERT. Protection of I172C of the SERT from MTSET inactivation by serotonin was not dependent on temperature or Na+ suggesting that it resulted from direct occlusion and was not secondary to a substrate-induced conformational change (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, results obtained previously (22Dodd J.R. Christie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46983-46988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in Fig. 5 show that protection by creatine from MTSEA inactivation of both the Cys-144 of WT CreaT and the I140C mutant is reduced in the absence of Na+ and Cl-. Although these ions do not appear to affect the solvent accessibility of these positions, it appears that Na+ and/or Cl- may be required for creatine binding. We found that higher concentrations of creatine were required to prevent reactivity of I140C with MTSEA than were needed for WT CreaT. However, for both the I140C mutant and WT CreaT, the concentration of creatine required for 50% protection from MTSEA inactivation was 3–4-fold higher than the Km for transport. Both Y147C CreaT and the corresponding SERT mutant Y175C showed substantially impaired levels of transport activity (∼25% of controls), although the SERT mutant was found to retain cocaine binding (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This supports the suggestion that this position corresponds to one of the conserved residues in TM3 that is critical for transporter function, even though it appears not to be involved directly in substrate binding (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We found the solvent accessibility of Y147C as judged by both MTSEA inactivation and creatine protection (Fig. 5) to be dependent on Na+ and Cl-. We suggest that on binding these ions, there is a conformation change involving position 147, which is required for the formation of the creatine binding site. Cysteine mutants that are either inactive or sensitive to MTSEA correspond to the positions of Trp-154, Val-151, Tyr-148/Tyr-147, Cys-144, and Ile-140. These are aligned 3–4 amino acids apart in the linear sequence (Fig. 7A). A helical wheel of TM3 indicates that all of these residues are located on one face of a helix (Fig. 7B). A helical net projection shows the vertical alignment of positions sensitive to mutation and/or inactivation by MTSEA (Fig. 7C). This suggests that one side of the helix faces toward the binding pocket. The three positions protected from MTSEA inactivation by creatine (Ile-140, Cys-144, and Tyr-147) and thus close to a substrate binding site are found in the middle of the predicted helix. We consider that only MTSEA can penetrate the creatine transport pathway. Trp-154 is predicted to be located near the external surface of the helix (Fig. 1), as this residue was accessible to the larger MTSET and MTSES reagents. MTSEA (66 Å3) is of a similar size to the CreaT substrates creatine and 3-guanidino propionate, whereas MTSET, which was used for studies of the SERT, is significantly larger (109 Å3). We have shown that residues within TM3 of the creatine transporter form part of a substrate transport pathway. This is likely to extend from Trp-154 to Ile-140. The binding of creatine may depend on Na+- and Cl--dependent conformational changes. Other regions of the transporter must also contribute to the binding site. Recently the aqueous accessibility of TM1 of the SERT and GAT-1 has been shown to be modulated by substrates (24Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Also TMs 1 and 2 of GAT-4 have been shown to contain molecular determinants of substrate specificity (26Melamed N. Kanner B.I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1452-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Further studies are required to see how these and other TMs are oriented in relation to TM3. The CreaT is a transporter required for the uptake of a substrate important for energy metabolism, a function seemingly distinct from neurotransmitter transport. However, our data together with studies of the SERT (21Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28321-28327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggest involvement of residues from TM3 to be a common feature of substrate pathways for other members of the Na+- and Cl--dependent neurotransmitter transporter (SLC6) family."

The sequence of cell cycle events is highly regulated to ensure the faithful duplication and segregation of the genome associated with cell division. Various surveillance mechanisms, or checkpoints, coordinate and monitor such events as DNA replication, DNA repair, spindle formation, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and changes in cell size (1Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Murakami H. Nurse P. Biochem.

If genotoxic stress results in damage to DNA, for example, checkpoint activation triggers cell cycle arrest before cells enter mitosis to provide sufficient time for the damage to be repaired. In many eukaryotes, the protein kinase Cdc2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) controls the onset of mitosis in a manner dependent on various internal and external conditions that include the presence of DNA damage, the status of DNA replication, nutrient availability, and cell size (5MacNeill S.A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar). The activity of Cdc2 is determined by the phosphorylation status of its Tyr15 residue and the availability of cyclin (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2 on Tyr15 is catalyzed by the tyrosine kinases Wee1 and Mik1, and the dephosphorylation of this residue is mediated predominantly by the tyrosine phosphatase Cdc25 (5MacNeill S.A.

Splicing of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) 3The abbreviations used are: pre-mRNA, precursor mRNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; wt, wild-type. is essential for the expression of most protein-coding genes in eukaryotes and is mediated by the sequential assembly and rearrangement of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, or spliceosomes, on the pre-mRNA (6Brow D.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 333-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). After completion of the splicing reactions responsible for the excision of each intron, the spliceosome dissociates from the mature mRNA, and the excised introns are rapidly degraded. The prp (pre-mRNA processing) mutants prp5, prp6, prp8, prp11, prp12, prp13, prp14, and prp17 of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) manifest both accumulation of pre-mRNAs and the cell division cycle arrest (cdc) phenotype (7Habara Y.

Furthermore, DBF3 and DBF5 in budding yeast are required not only for DNA replication but also for pre-mRNA splicing (11Johnston L.H. Thomas A.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 186: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, a component of a 40 S small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-containing complex that is a homolog of fission yeast Cdc5p and budding yeast Cef1 contributes to the G2-M transition of the cell cycle (15Bernstein H.S. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4666-4671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K.

A human Dim1 family protein is an evolutionarily conserved U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein, and its fission yeast ortholog is required for entry into mitosis (18Berry L.D. Gould K.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1337-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 19Sun X. Zhang H. Wang D. Ma D. Shen Y. Shang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32839-32847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Many genes are repressed during mitosis because of the down-regulation of transcription, polyadenylation of RNA, and translation (20Gottesfeld J.M. Forbes D.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 197-202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and pre-mRNA splicing has also been found to be targeted for inhibition during mitosis (21Shin C. Manley J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 407-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These various observations suggest that regulation of a link between pre-mRNA splicing and the cell cycle is highly conserved. In addition, defects in degradation of the intron lariat result in a marked delay in cell cycle progression (22Nam K. Lee G. Trambley J. Devine S.E. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), further supporting the notion that defective RNA metabolism triggers cell cycle arrest. Many cell cycle regulators have been identified in genetic screens for cdc mutants in fission yeast (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar). Some cdc mutants, including cdc1 (subunit of DNA polymerase δ), cdc17 (DNA ligase), and cdc18 (homolog of budding yeast Cdc6), are defective in DNA metabolism, whereas others (cdc2, cdc13, or cdc25) are defective in the cell cycle machinery itself (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar). In addition, two mutants, cdc5 and cdc28, have been found to be deficient in pre-mRNA splicing. Whereas cdc5+ encodes a Myb-related protein, cdc28+ is allelic with prp8+ and encodes a DEAH box-containing an RNA helicase (9Lundgren K. Allan S. Urushiyama S. Tani T. Ohshima Y. Frendewey D. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Many cdc mutants with defects in DNA replication arrest in a manner dependent on the DNA damage checkpoint (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar), whereas cdc mutants with defects in the cell cycle machinery arrest independently of this checkpoint (23Hayles J. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2760-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have now screened for cdc mutants that arrest independently of the DNA damage checkpoint to reveal new mechanisms of cell cycle arrest. We found that pre-mRNA splicing-deficient cdc28 cells arrest independently of the DNA damage checkpoint, and we investigated the mechanism of cell cycle arrest in these cells. Yeast Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—Complete medium (YES, yeast extract plus supplement) and minimal medium (EMM, Edinburgh minimal medium) were prepared and standard methods were performed as described (24Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). The procedures for gene disruption and COOH-terminal tagging of proteins with HA or the Myc epitope were described previously (25Bahler J. Wu J.Q. Longtine M.S. Shah N.G. McKenzie 3rd, A. Steever A.B. Wach A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). Transformation of S. pombe was performed by the lithium method (26Okazaki K. Okazaki N. Kume K. Jinno S. Tanaka K. Okayama H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6485-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For microscopic analysis, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as described (27Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The strains studied include HM4 (h– leu1-32 (wt)), HM202 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18 cdc17-K42 (cdc17)), HM244 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18 cdc18-K46 (cdc18)), HM520 (h– leu1-32 orp1-4 (orp1)), HM522 (h– orp1–4 wee1–50 (orp1 wee1)), HM560 (h– leu1-32 wee1-50 (wee1)), HM764 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18 rad24::ura4+ (rad24)), HM1202 (h+ leu1-32 cdc1-7 (cdc1)), HM1204 (h– leu1-32 swi7-H4 (swi7)), HM2855 (h– leu1-32 cdc28-P8 mik1::LEU2 wee1-50 (cdc28 mik1 wee1)), HM2863 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18 cdc28-P8 rad24::ura4+ (cdc28 rad24)), HM2892 (h– leu1-32 ura4-D18 wee1HA-6His-ura4+ (wt Wee1-HA), kindly provided by P.

Isolation of Mutants with Abrogated G2 Arrest in cdc28 Cells—cdc28 cells were mutagenized with 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (28Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 29Tanaka K. Yonekawa T. Kawasaki Y. Kai M. Furuya K. Iwasaki M. Murakami H. Yanagida M. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3459-3469Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), spread on YES plates, and incubated for 4 days at 24 °C. Colonies (8 × 104) were replica-plated on YES medium containing PhloxinB (0.01 mg/ml) and incubated at 34 °C, and strains that grew poorly or died were collected. Cells that did not show the cdc phenotype were selected and crossed with the wt strain. Among those that were not linked to wee1+, we focused on one mutant designated 3c13. We transformed the double 3c13 cdc28 mutant with an S. pombe genomic library and found that orb5+ suppressed the phenotype of 3c13 but not that of cdc28. We crossed the 3c13 mutant with the orb5-19 mutant, which was isolated as a morphology mutant defective in reestablishment of polarized growth (30Snell V. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2066-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Among 5000 cells examined, there were no wt cells, indicating that orb5+ is the gene affected by the 3c13 mutation. Indeed, we detected two point mutations in the open reading frame of orb5+ in 3c13 cells; Glu59 and Gly239 were changed to lysine and glutamic acid, respectively. Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (27Murakami H. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Extracts (0.06 mg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was performed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Cdc2p phosphorylated on Tyr15 (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology) as well as with mouse monoclonal antibodies to Cdc13p (1:1000 dilution; SP4, kindly provided by P. Nurse), to Cdc2p (1:5000 dilution, y63), to Myc (1:2000 dilution, Pharmingen), to hemagglutinin (1:1000 dilution, Roche), and to α-tubulin (1:20,000 dilution, Sigma). Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Amersham Biosciences) and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (5 μg) extracted from cells with the use of Isogen (Wako) was denatured in loading buffer and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The RNA molecules were transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet irradiation. Probes (DNA fragments containing the coding regions of tfIId+, cdc13+, cdc25+, or ade6+ genes) were labeled with 32P with the use of a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (9Lundgren K. Allan S. Urushiyama S. Tani T. Ohshima Y. Frendewey D. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Preparation of Synchronous Cultures—For synchronization in G1, exponentially growing cells in EMM medium were washed several times with and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml in EMM medium without a nitrogen source. After incubation for 14–15 h at 24 °C, the cells were released into YES medium or, for those harboring plasmids, into EMM medium at 36.5 °C. For synchronization in G2, cells grown to log phase at 24 °C were layered on top of a 7–30% lactose gradient and centrifuged for 8 min at 1000 rpm and room temperature. Small cells recovered from the top of the gradient were inoculated into YES medium, incubated (or not) at 42 °C for 50 min to inactivate ts protein efficiently, and then incubated at 36.5 °C for various times. Cells collected at intervals of 10–15 min were fixed in ethanol and stained with DAPI for monitoring of cell cycle progression. Cell Cycle Arrest Independent of the DNA Damage Checkpoint—To identify novel mechanisms of cell cycle arrest that are independent of the DNA damage checkpoint, we crossed several cdc mutants (cdc1, cdc2, cdc5, cdc10, cdc13, cdc17, cdc18, cdc19, cdc20, cdc21, cdc22, cdc23, cdc24, cdc25, cdc27, or cdc28) with the checkpoint-defective rad1 mutant (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar). In the rad1 background, cdc2, cdc5, cdc10, cdc13, cdc25, and cdc28 mutants still manifested the cdc phenotype, whereas the other cdc mutants showed the “cut” phenotype, which is a marker for aberrant mitosis. Whereas cdc2+, cdc10+, cdc13+, and cdc25+ encode important cell cycle regulators, cdc5+ and cdc28+ are required for pre-mRNA splicing (9Lundgren K. Allan S. Urushiyama S. Tani T. Ohshima Y. Frendewey D. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Ohi R. McCollum D. Hirani B. Den Haese G.J. Zhang X. Burke J.D. Turner K. Gould K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 31McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mechanism of cell cycle arrest in these splicing mutants is largely unknown. To confirm that the arrest of cdc28 cells is independent of the DNA damage checkpoint, we constructed a cdc28 rad3 tel1 mutant. Most of these cells did not enter mitosis and arrested with the cdc phenotype at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1a), verifying that cdc28 cells arrest independently of the DNA damage checkpoint. Isolation of Mutants That Progress through Mitosis in the cdc28 Background—To clarify the mechanism of cell cycle arrest in cdc28 cells, we searched for mutants that progress through mitosis with defective pre-mRNA splicing. From 80,000 independent colonies, we isolated 10 mutants that failed to show the cdc phenotype and manifested reduced viability at the semirestrictive temperature. Genetic crosses and phenotypic analyses revealed that four of these mutants were linked to wee1+ (32Nurse P. Nature. 1975; 256: 451-457Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and one was to orb5+ (see “Materials and Methods”). The orb5+ gene encodes a catalytic subunit of casein kinase II (CK2), which is a highly conserved serine-threonine kinase (33Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The orb5-3c13 single mutant exhibited no obvious defect in cell cycle progression (Fig. 1b), although its growth rate was slightly reduced at high temperature, whereas complete deletion of orb5+ was lethal. 4M. Shimada, C. Namikawa-Yamada, M. Nakanishi, and H, Murakami, unpublished data. Ckb1p is a regulatory subunit of CK2 in fission yeast (34Roussou I. Draetta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like cdc28 orb5 cells, cdc28 ckb1 cells also entered mitosis, 4M. Shimada, C. Namikawa-Yamada, M. Nakanishi, and H, Murakami, unpublished data. suggesting that fission yeast CK2 is required for cell cycle arrest in mutants. orb5+, wee1+ splicing, and rad24+Are Requiredfor Cell Cycle Delay in cdc28 Cells—Given that we identified both wee1+ and orb5+ as potential key regulators of cell cycle arrest in cdc28 cells, we investigated the phenotype of the double mutants further. We synchronized cdc28, cdc28 orb5, and cdc28 wee1 cells in G1 by nitrogen deprivation and released them into rich medium at the restrictive temperature (36.5 °C). At 4 h, the frequency of binucleate cells was increased for wt, cdc28 orb5, and cdc28 wee1 cells but not for cdc28 cells (Fig. 1, a and b). These results suggested that wee1+ and orb5+ are required for inhibition of the entry of cdc28 cells into mitosis. The rad24+ gene is required for the DNA damage checkpoint (1Russell P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 399-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar) as well as for the cell cycle arrest induced in fission yeast by accessory protein R (Vpr) of human immunodeficiency virus (35Masuda M. Nagai Y. Oshima N. Tanaka K. Murakami H. Igarashi H. Okayama H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2636-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found that cdc28 rad24 cells progressed through mitosis (Fig. 1b). Taken together these results indicate that orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ are required for cell cycle arrest in cdc28 cells. To examine the relation between orb5+ and wee1+, we constructed a cdc28 orb5 wee1 mutant. The proportion of cells that entered mitosis was greater for the triple mutant than for the cdc28 orb5 or cdc28 wee1 double mutants (Fig. 1c), suggesting that orb5+ and wee1+ have an additive effect on entry into mitosis in cdc28 cells. Whereas cdc28 mik1 cells showed a cdc phenotype similar to that of cdc28 cells, 4M. Shimada, C. Namikawa-Yamada, M. Nakanishi, and H, Murakami, unpublished data. cdc28 mik1 wee1 cells entered mitosis more frequently than did cdc28 wee1 cells (Fig. 1c). In addition, expression of cdc2-F15, which encodes a Cdc2p mutant in which Tyr15 is replaced with phenylalanine induced the cut phenotype in cdc28 cells grown at the restrictive temperature (36.5 °C) but not in wild-type cells (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that phosphorylation of Cdc2p on Tyr15 is required for the arrest of cdc28 cells. We next examined whether overexpression of cdc13+ induced cdc28 cells to enter mitosis (Fig. 1e). Although overexpression of cdc13+ did not affect the frequency of M phase entry in wt cells, it partially alleviated the arrest of cdc28 cells. These results suggest that the regulation of Cdc2p both by phosphorylation on Tyr15 and by Cdc13p contributes to the arrest of cdc28 cells. orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+Are Required for Cell Cycle Arrest in prp12 or dbr1 Cells—To test whether orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ are required for cell cycle arrest in another pre-mRNA splicing-deficient mutant, we examined prp12 cells. Prp12p is required for formation of a functional U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7Habara Y. Urushiyama S. Shibuya T. Ohshima Y. Tani T. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We found that prp12 orb5, prp12 wee1, and prp12 rad24 cells entered mitosis, whereas most prp12 cells did not (Fig. 2a), suggesting that orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ are all required for cell cycle arrest in prp12 cells. We next investigated whether orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ are required for cell cycle delay caused by a defect in RNA metabolism other than impaired pre-mRNA splicing. In fission yeast, dbr1 cells accumulate introns to high levels, grow slowly, and exhibit the cdc phenotype (22Nam K. Lee G. Trambley J. Devine S.E. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Like the splicing mutants, dbr1 cells showed a marked delay in entry into mitosis, whereas dbr1 orb5, dbr1 wee1, or dbr1 rad24 cells entered mitosis more frequently (Fig. 2b). These results thus indicate both that orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ are required for cell cycle delay in dbr1 cells as well as that accumulated introns induce cell cycle delay by a mechanism similar to that operative in splicing mutants. Contribution of orb5+, wee1+, rad24+, and cdc13+to Cell Survival in cdc28, prp12, or dbr1 Cells—If orb5+, wee1+, and rad24+ contribute to cell cycle arrest in splicing mutants, it would be expected that cell survival would decrease when the arrest is abrogated. To test this prediction, we determined the survival of G1-synchronized cells after shifting the incubation temperature to 36.5 °C for 8 h. The viability of cdc28 orb5, cdc28 wee1, or cdc28 rad24 cells decreased markedly as a result of incubation at the restrictive temperature, whereas that of the corresponding single mutants remained largely unchanged (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the viability of prp12 orb5, prp12 wee1, or prp12 rad24 mutants as well as that of dbr1 orb5, dbr1 wee1, or dbr1 rad24 cells was decreased by incubation at 36.5 °C, whereas that of prp12 and dbr1 single mutants remained constant. In addition, overexpression of cdc13+ also reduced the viability of cdc28 cells (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that the mechanism of cell cycle arrest regulated by orb5+, wee1+, rad24+, and cdc13+ is important for cell survival in RNA metabolism mutants. orb5+ Is Not Required for the DNA Replication and DNA Damage Checkpoints—To investigate whether orb5+ is important for S phase arrest induced by inactivation of DNA replication proteins, we constructed double mutants of orb5 and several cdc mutants that arrest in S phase (cdc1, cdc17, cdc18, orp1, or swi7) (5MacNeill S.A. Nurse P. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. Jones E.W. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Cell Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1997: 697-763Google Scholar, 28Murakami H. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 374: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 36Nasmyth K.A. Cell. 1977; 12: 1109-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Orp1p is the largest subunit of the origin recognition complex, and Swi7p is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α. The cdc1 orb5, cdc17 orb5, cdc18 orb5, orp1 orb5, and swi7 orb5 mutants manifested the cdc phenotype similar to that of the corresponding single cdc mutants and most of the double mutant cells did not enter mitosis (Fig. 4, a and b), suggesting that orb5+ is not required for cell cycle arrest in the single cdc mutants. In contrast, a substantial proportion of cdc1 wee1, cdc17 wee1, cdc18 wee1, orp1 wee1, swi7 wee1, cdc1 rad24, cdc17 rad24, cdc18 rad24, and orp1 rad24 cells entered mitosis, suggesting that wee1+ and rad24+ contribute to cell cycle arrest in these mutants. We next tested whether orb5+ is required for the arrest induced either by hydroxyurea, which inhibits DNA replication, or by methylmethane sulfonate, which induces DNA alkylation. Like wt cells, orb5 cells showed the cdc phenotype after treatment with either of these agents (Fig. 4c). These data suggested that orb5+ is not required for operation of the DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoints. cdc28 orb5, cdc28 wee1, and cdc28 rad24 Cells Progress through Mitosis with Unspliced mRNA—It was possible that cdc28 orb5, cdc28 wee1, and cdc28 rad24 cells entered mitosis by suppressing the splicing defect of cdc28 cells. To test this possibility, we performed Northern blot analysis of the tfIId+ gene, which encodes a TATA box-binding factor and contains three introns (37Hoffman A. Sinn E. Yamamoto T. Wang J. Roy A. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). After incubation of cells for 4 or 8 h at 36.5 °C, substantial amounts of tfIId+ pre-mRNA had accumulated in cdc28, cdc28 orb5, cdc28 wee1, and cdc28 rad24 cells but not in wt cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that orb5, wee1, and rad24 do not suppress the splicing defect of cdc28 cells and that cdc28 orb5, cdc28 wee1"

Different programs of gene expression are subsequently directed by compartment-specific RNA polymerase σ-factors. In the final stages, spore coat proteins are synthesized in the mother cell under the control of RNA polymerase containing σK, (EσK). σK is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, pro-σK, which is activated by proteolytic cleavage. Processing of pro-σK is performed by SpoIVFB, a metalloprotease that resides in a complex with SpoIVFA and bypass of forespore (Bof)A in the outer forespore membrane. Ensuring coordination of events taking place in the two compartments, pro-σK processing in the mother cell is delayed until appropriate signals are received from the forespore. Cell-cell signaling is mediated by SpoIVB and BofC, which are expressed in the forespore and secreted to the intercompartmental space where they regulate pro-σK processing by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of BofC determined by solution state NMR. BofC is a monomer made up of two domains. The N-terminal domain, containing a four-stranded β-sheet onto one face of which an α-helix is packed, closely resembles the third immunoglobulin-binding domain of protein G from Streptococcus.

Possible roles for BofC in the σK checkpoint are discussed in the light of sequence and structure comparisons. In response to starvation, Bacillus subtilis and its relatives have the remarkable capacity to abandon growth and embark on a developmental pathway that leads to the production of dormant spores that are resistant to a variety of physical stresses. Sporulation begins with an asymmetric septation, which gives rise to two cells of unequal size but with identical chromosomes. The smaller cell is called the forespore, as it is destined to mature into the resistant spore, whereas the larger compartment is referred to as the mother cell, because it subsequently engulfs the forespore and nurtures the latter during its development. In the final stages, the mother cell lyses, and the mature spore is released into the environment where it can remain dormant indefinitely, germinating when favorable conditions for growth are restored (1Piggot P.J. Hilbert D.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar).A hallmark of sporulation is the utilization of a series of spatially and temporally regulated RNA polymerase σ-factors to effect differential gene expression from the identical chromosomes present in the forespore and the mother cell. σF, σE, σG, and σK become activated sequentially as part of what has been termed a crisscross regulatory cascade (2Losick R. Stragier P. Nature. 1992; 355: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Activation of each component depends on the expression of genes under the regulation of the preceding σ-factor in the cascade and on signals being relayed between the two compartments. σF and σG become activated in the forespore, whereas σE and σK become active in the mother cell. The activation of these σ-factors is coordinated and linked to morphogenetic events to ensure that development proceeds appropriately. As a result, the sporulation process is punctuated by a series of checkpoints at which the activation of subsequent events is delayed until an appropriate set of cues has been received (3Stragier P. Losick R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 297-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).The last of the σ-factors to become activated is σK. RNA polymerase containing σK (EσK) transcribes mother cell genes encoding spore coat proteins, as well as later-acting factors involved in the release of the spore from the mother cell and in spore germination. The σK checkpoint ensures that σK becomes active in the mother cell only at the appropriate stage of forespore development, which is ∼3 h after the onset of sporulation (4Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology (Read.). 1997; 143: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Premature activation of σK, by as little as 30 min, leads to aberrant spore formation (6Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transcription of sigK, which encodes σK, takes place from a σE-dependent promoter and is confined to the mother cell (7Hilbert D.W. Piggot P.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 234-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). σK is translated as an inactive precursor with a 20-residue N-terminal pro-sequence that targets pro-σK to the outer forespore membrane and prevents it from binding to core RNA polymerase (5Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Zhang B. Hofmeister A. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2434-2441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the pro-sequence to yield mature σK is catalyzed by SpoIVFB, an integral membrane metalloprotease found in the outer forespore membrane (9Resnekov O. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Yu Y.-T. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SpoIVFB-mediated processing of σK is under complex regulation involving mother cell and forespore-derived factors (5Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this complex, SpoIVFB is stabilized and pro-σK cleavage is delayed (13Rudner D.Z. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Zhou R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl.

A. 1998; 95: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The forespore signal is provided by SpoIVB (15Oke V. Shchepetov M. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a protein expressed at low levels under the control of σF and at augmented levels under σG control (16Gomez M. Cutting S. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4825-4827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SpoIVB contains a signal peptide, a PDZ domain, and a serine peptidase domain (17Wakeley P. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T.

It has been proposed that SpoIVB is secreted into the intercompartmental space where it interacts with the BofA-SpoIVFA-SpoIVFB complex. This, in turn, leads to SpoIVB-mediated cleavage of SpoIVFA (19Kroos L. Yu Y.-T.N. Mills D. Ferguson-Miller S. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 43468-43478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).bofC was discovered as a gene whose deletion in a spoIIIG (which encodes σG) null mutant background restores signaling of pro-σK processing, giving rise to a Bof phenotype (4Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology (Read.). 1997; 143: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suggests that BofC is able to inhibit pro-σK processing by SpoIVB but only when the latter is present at the low concentrations produced by EσF. bofC deletion in a wild-type background does not affect pro-σK processing (4Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology (Read.). 1997; 143: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).BofC has no motifs to suggest a putative function nor does its sequence resemble any other proteins besides BofC orthologues. To gain further insights into forespore control of pro-σK processing in B. subtilis, we have embarked on structural studies of SpoIVB and BofC. Here we present the solution structure of BofC determined by NMR. A full list of chemical shifts and NMR assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number 6731).MATERIALS AND METHODSPurification of BofC—The plasmid pET28bBofC was provided by Dr. T. C. Dong, Royal Holloway, University of London. pET28bBofC contains the coding sequence for the full-length 170-residue BofC pre-protein. For overproduction of BofC, overnight cultures of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pET28bBofC were used to inoculate fresh LB medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6–0.7. Expression of recombinant protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were grown at 30 °C for a further 3.5 h.A 0.1 volume of Tris-HCl at 100 mm (pH 8.5) was added to the shaking flasks, and 10 min later, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in one-fifth of the original culture volume of a 40% sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 2 mm EDTA solution. After gentle swirling for 20 min at room temperature, the cells were again harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in one-eighth the original volume of ice-cold water. Cellular material was removed in a further centrifugation step, and the supernatant representing the periplasmic fraction was reduced in volume by ultra filtration (Vivascience), exchanged into buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 5mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column. The column was developed with a 10–400 mm NaCl gradient in buffer A. BofC eluted as a sharp peak at ∼100 mm NaCl. The protein was subsequently purified to homogeneity by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column in buffer A. The yield of BofC was 2–3 mg/liter of cell culture.Labeling of Protein by 13C and 15N—For BofC structure determination by solution NMR, an overnight culture was grown at 37 °C in a minimal medium of the following composition: 27 mm Na+/K+ phosphate (pH 6), 2 mm NaCl, 2 mm13 15 MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml 15NH4Cl, 0.4% d-glucose (for C N labeling, 0.2% d-[13C]glucose was used), 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and 1 μg/ml of each of the vitamins riboflavin, niacinamide, pyridoxine monohydrochloride, and thiamine. Expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.6–0.7 by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 1 mm, and the cells were cultured at 30 °C overnight. BofC was purified as described under “Purification of BofC.”Protein Analysis—Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using an API QSTAR liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry system. Protein masses were predicted using the ExPASy ProtParam tool (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html).Dynamic light scattering was performed on a ProteinSolutions DynaPro machine. Samples were centrifuged before injection into the cells, and the data were analyzed using the Dynamics software package, version 5.Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL/A analytical Ultracentrifuge, using a Beckman cell with a 12-mm path length in an AN-50Ti rotor. Absorbance scans (at 280 nm) were taken at ∼3 hourly intervals until sedimentation equilibrium was achieved. The data were analyzed using the Beckman Origin software.NMR Spectroscopy—All spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker DRX700 and DRX900 spectrometers operating at 700 and 900 MHz frequencies, proton respectively. 15N- and 13C15N-labeled samples were prepared in buffers containing 20 mm Na2PO4 (pH 6), 1 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For backbone and Hβ/Cβ assignments, sequential (i-1) three-dimensional HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, and HBHA(CO)NH in combination with bifurcate (i,i-1) three-dimensional HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HNCACB, and HN(CA)HA spectra were recorded. All spectra were processed in XWinNMR (Bruker, Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany), whereas assignment was performed using PASTA (22Leutner M. Gschwind R.M. Lermann J. Schwarz C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and AutoAssign (23Zimmerman D.E. Kulikowski C.A. Huang Y. Feng W. Tashiro M. Shimotakahara S. Chien C. Powers R. Montelione G.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 592-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) with peak lists generated within SPARKY (www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky). Side-chain assignment from three-dimensional C(CCO)NH total correlated spectroscopy, H(C)CH total correlated spectroscopy (employing 15 ms of flip-flop spectroscopy-16 (25Kadkhodaei M. Rivas O. Tan M. Mohebbi A. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 91: 437-443Google Scholar) C,C-mixing each), and (H)CCH-correlated spectroscopy was assisted by in-house software (to be published). A two-dimensional H,H total correlated spectrum, employing 50 ms of XY16 mixing (26Furrer J. Kramer F. Marino J.P. Glaser S.J. Luy B. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 166: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with H-15N suppression in the direct dimension was additionally recorded for the assignment of aromatic moieties.Distance data were derived from four three-dimensional (HSQC)-NOESY-HSQC spectra, all recorded with a 100-ms NOE evolution time: H,NH-NOESY, H,CH-NOESY, (H)C,CH-NOESY and (H)C,NH-NOESY. For a verification of possible protein aggregation, a pseudo-two-dimensional diffusion-ordered spectroscopy experiment was measured employing double-pulsed field gradient echoes with variable gradient strength and a diffusion delay of 150 ms. Results were referenced against the known value for the water diffusion rate at 298 K (2.3 × 10–9 m2/s) sampled with the same pulse sequence but with the final WATERGATE suppression module omitted.NOE Analysis and Structure Calculations—Automatic NOE assignment and structure calculations were performed using the CANDID module of the program CYANA (27Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar, 28Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The quality of the structures was improved in an iterative procedure where CANDID runs were followed by manual analysis. Comparing the NOESY spectra to the preliminary structure subsequently allowed the assignment of missing resonances and improved the quality of the peak lists. Hydrogen bond restraints were defined when they were consistent with the secondary shift data, expected NOE contacts, and the calculated structure. Manual NOE peak assignments were generally not fixed in the CANDID runs but were used to create accurate spectrum-specific chemical shift lists to check the consistency of subsequent CANDID runs and to verify the manual assignments. The final CANDID run was performed using CYANA version 2.0 with Ramachandran and side-chain rotamer dihedral angle restraints in all but the last cycle. In the final cycle, fixed stereospecific assignments of prochiral groups were used when available.The final set of NOE-based restraints determined by CANDID, in combination with restraints for 38 H-bonds and dihedral restraints for 90 residues from TALOS, were used in a water refinement run using crystallography NMR software (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Structures were validated using WHATIF (31Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 33Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONProduction and Characterization of Recombinant BofC—BofC has an N-terminal signal sequence typical of proteins secreted from Bacillus by the Sec-type secretion system (34Nagarajan V. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 713-726Google Scholar, 35Tjalsma H. Antelmann H. Jongbloed J.D.H. Braun P.G. Darmon E. Dorenbos R. Dubois J.-Y.F. Westers H. Zanen G. Quax W.J. Kuipers O.P. Bron S. Hecker M. van Dijl J.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Fusion of this signal peptide sequence to a sequence encoding E. coli alkaline phosphatase produced alkaline phosphatase activity in the periplasm (36Wakeley P. Hoa N.T. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), implying that BofC can be translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. Osmotic shock was used here to demonstrate that BofC is directed to the periplasm of E. coli, consistent with the hypothesis that BofC is secreted into the intermembrane space between the mother cell and forespore in B. subtilis.Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of purified BofC revealed a band toward the high end of the region demarcated by the 14–21.5-kDa standard markers. If BofC is cleaved by signal peptidase I upon secretion, the resulting polypeptide would have a predicted molecular mass of ∼16.2 kDa (36Wakeley P. Hoa N.T. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry suggested that the purified product expressed from pET28bBofC has a mass of 16,173 ± 2 Da, consistent with truncation of the N-terminal residues, to give a mature protein beginning at residue Ala31 (data not shown). BofC-(31–170) has a calculated mass of 16,173 Da. Successive cycles of Edman degradation yielded the sequence Ala-Glu-Val-Glu-His corresponding to residues 31–35 of BofC and unambiguously identifying the product as BofC-(31–170). These data show that secretion of BofC from E. coli is accompanied by signal peptidase I cleavage. Henceforth, the BofC numbering will refer to the mature protein (residues 1–140) whose structure has been determined.BofC migrated as a single band in native polyacrylamide gels (8.75%), suggesting a homogeneous preparation, an inference supported by dynamic light scattering experiments. The molecular mass of BofC was estimated to be 14 kDa from the retention volume of BofC relative to molecular weight standards during gel filtration. This indicates that BofC is a monomer, a result confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium experiments in the analytical Ultracentrifuge, which gave a molecular mass of 16,700 ± 100 Da. NMR diffusion-ordered two-dimensional spectroscopy measurements at 298 K also agreed well with the conclusion that BofC is a monomer (data not shown).NMR Spectroscopy—Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of 15N-labeled BofC revealed a molecular mass of 16,359 Da, suggesting 98% efficiency of labeling. Initial 15N-HSQC spectra were recorded at 700 MHz in buffers of varying salt concentrations and pH and at different temperatures (supplemental Fig. S1). For most conditions tested, the signal dispersion in this fingerprint spectrum was high and indicative of a well folded protein. Stability tests were carried out to optimize the buffer conditions. The doubly labeled sample had a predicted mass of 17,095 Da and a recorded mass of 17,081 Da, establishing again that labeling was almost complete.Backbone resonances of BofC were assigned with the PASTA tool (22Leutner M. Gschwind R.M. Lermann J. Schwarz C. Gemmecker G. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) using sequential C-α,C-β,C′ and H-α chemical shift information obtained from the array of triple-resonance experiments outlined under “Materials and Methods” resulting in 97.6% complete assignment. Assignment of side chains was 94.2% complete; a small number of side-chain protons, generally the labile amino protons of arginine and lysine residues, remained unassigned due to weak intensity or ambiguity.NOE Assignments and Structure Calculations—The first automatic NOE assignment and structure calculation using the CANDID module in CYANA was performed when the completeness of proton resonance assignments reached 79%. The N-terminal domain converged to the correct fold in the first run, whereas the C-terminal domain converged consistently to the correct fold only after the completeness reached 93%. The final completeness was 94.2% for non-exchanging protons.The final set of NOE restraints, H-bond restraints, and dihedral restraints was used to generate water-refined structures following the RECOORD protocol. 100 structures were annealed from extended chains in vacuum, of which the 85 lowest energy structures were subjected to water refinement. Of these, the 25 lowest energy structures were selected for the final structure set. A summary of the results of the structure calculations is given in supplemental Table S1.Description of the Secondary Structure and Fold—The secondary structure of BofC was determined from C-α,C-β,C′, and H-α chemical shift indices (37Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar, 38Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M.

NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and backbone NOE patterns, indicating seven β-strands and four α-helices. The folding topology of the protein was obtained from NOE contacts between the β-strands, (Fig. 2A), revealing two separate domains. In addition to the four helices clearly predicted by the secondary structure data, a putative fifth helix (αB) was less clearly indicated. This helix was later confirmed during quantitative structure determination, and the fold could thus be viewed as comprising two domains: one mainly β (N-terminal domain) and the other α + β (C-terminal domain) linked by a long loop partially formed by helix αB (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2The three-dimensional structure of BofC. A, topology diagram with strands as arrows and helices as circles. B, stereo C-α representation with every tenth residue numbered. C, ensemble of the 25 lowest energy NMR solution structures superposed on the N-terminal domain (left) and the C-terminal domain (right). D, Ribbon diagram of the lowest energy structure of BofC. B and D were drawn in Pymol (www.pymol.org).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal domain is composed of a four-stranded β-sheet covered by an α-helix. The β-sheet has a β2-β1-β4-β3 topology as illustrated in Fig. 2A. Strands β1 and β2 and strands β3 and β4 are connected by β-turns, whereas strands β2 and β3 are joined by an α-helix that runs across one face of the β-sheet. The N-terminal domain is very well defined by a large number of NOE contacts. A sequence of 11 residues links the N- and C-terminal domains. The C terminus of this linker region includes helix αB. This helix is very short, consisting of five residues, and is separated from the core of the C-terminal domain by further unstructured residues, effectively continuing the linker. The C-terminal domain comprises three α-helices and three short anti-parallel β-strands. The β-sheet has the strand order β5-β6-β7. The three helices pack in a somewhat loose arrangement around this sheet. The longest of the helices, αE, runs almost parallel to the sheet, and helix αD runs roughly perpendicular to the sheet with its C terminus located near to strand β5 of the sheet.Tertiary Structure and Domain Interactions—NMR data give insight into both structure and dynamics. Often the presence of NOE contacts implies rigidity in the structure, whereas their absence indicates flexibility. From the experimental NMR data, the N-terminal domain of BofC is the better defined substructure, with an almost complete assignment of chemical shifts and a large number of NOE contacts defining the structure, with an average of 7.05 NOE contacts/residue. For the C-terminal domain, the resonance assignment is somewhat less complete, contributing to a less dense network of NOE connectivities, with an average of 4.35 NOE contacts/residue. Nonetheless, its structure is well defined, and the final structure ensemble displays very little dispersion (backbone root mean square deviation of 1.5 Å) (supplemental Table S1). Only the extensive loops connecting the elements of the secondary structure (three β-strands and three α-helices) show more substantial scattering, indicative of flexibility. Two adjacent loops near the C terminus (residues 86–100 and 119–124), located between β-strands 6 and 7 and between helices αD and αE, closely approach the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). The loop sequence between β6 and β7 is poorly conserved, suggesting that it is not functionally important. By contrast, the sequence at the beginning of the loop between helices αD and αE is conserved; this is remarkable, as the sequences of the helices themselves are poorly conserved except for some residues at the C terminus of helix αD. These regions might form a functionally important conserved interaction surface. We cannot exclude the importance of this region for structural integrity, but no NOE contacts were found between this surface-exposed region and the N-terminal domain.The linker region between the domains is poorly defined by the NMR data. Only a few long range NOE contacts could be unambiguously identified between the domains, i.e. between residues 19–24 (loop between β1 and β2) in the N-terminal domain and residues 97, 98, 125, 128, and 129 of the C-terminal domain. These contacts are, however, located quite close to the linker, whereas contacts farther away and thus with a larger structural “lever” are absent. Least squares superposition of the N-terminal domain structures (10–60) revealed a backbone root mean square deviation for the C-terminal domain (74–138) of 4.59 Å. Thus, the relative orientation of the domains appears quite flexible, within the steric restrictions imposed by the linker region. It could therefore be considered that both domains function in a way that does not require a s"
