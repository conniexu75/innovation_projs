https://openalex.org/W2804227301,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication after a surgery which is associated with morbidity and mortality. The majority of existing perioperative AKI risk score prediction models are limited in their generalizability and do not fully utilize the physiological intraoperative time-series data. Thus, there is a need for intelligent, accurate, and robust systems, able to leverage information from large-scale data to predict patient's risk of developing postoperative AKI. A retrospective single-center cohort of 2,911 adult patients who underwent surgery at the University of Florida Health has been used for this study. We used machine learning and statistical analysis techniques to develop perioperative models to predict the risk of AKI (risk during the first 3 days, 7 days, and until the discharge day) before and after the surgery. In particular, we examined the improvement in risk prediction by incorporating three intraoperative physiologic time series data, i.e., mean arterial blood pressure, minimum alveolar concentration, and heart rate. For an individual patient, the preoperative model produces a probabilistic AKI risk score, which will be enriched by integrating intraoperative statistical features through a machine learning stacking approach inside a random forest classifier. We compared the performance of our model based on the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC), accuracy and net reclassification improvement (NRI). The predictive performance of the proposed model is better than the preoperative data only model. For AKI-7day outcome: The AUC was 0.86 (accuracy was 0.78) in the proposed model, while the preoperative AUC was 0.84 (accuracy 0.76). Furthermore, with the integration of intraoperative features, we were able to classify patients who were misclassified in the preoperative model."

Our aim was to define the burden of CFLD in the UK using national registry data and identify risk factors for progressive disease. Methods A longitudinal population-based cohort study was conducted. Cases were defined as all patients with CFLD identified from the UK CF Registry, 2008–2013 (n = 3417). Denominator data were derived from the entire UK CF Registry. The burden of CFLD was characterised. Regression analysis was undertaken to identify risk factors for cirrhosis and progression. Results Prevalence of CFLD increased from 203.4 to 228.3 per 1000 patients during 2008–2013. Mortality in CF patients with CFLD was more than double those without; cirrhotic patients had higher all-cause mortality (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.18, p = 0.015). Median recorded age of cirrhosis diagnosis was 19 (range 5–53) years. Male sex, Pseudomonas airway infection and CF related diabetes were independent risk factors for cirrhosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid use was associated with prolonged survival in patients without cirrhosis. Conclusions This study highlights an important changing disease burden of CFLD. The prevalence is slowly increasing and, importantly, the disease is not just being diagnosed in childhood. Although the role of ursodeoxycholic acid remains controversial, this study identified a positive association with survival."

An efficient bioactive metabolites producing endophytic fungal strain AE1 was isolated from leaves of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. The metabolites were found to be thermostable, non-proteinacious and produced prominent zones of inhibition against numbers of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Based on 28S rDNA (D1/D2) sequence homology the isolate AE1 was identified as Alternaria alternata. Malt extract broth was found effective for the maximum production of bioactive metabolites by the isolate and was subjected for solvent extraction. The Ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of AE1 showed MIC values of 300–400 μg/ml against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria tested. The cidal mode of action of EA fraction was detected by treating bacterial cultures at mid log phase. Scanning electron microscopic study supported morphological disintegration of bacterial cells. Release of nucleic acid, protein and potassium ions (K+) also suggested lysis of bacterial cells or leakage of cell membrane upon treatment. In addition, reduction of the activity of EMP pathway, TCA cycle and gluconeogenic enzymes in all bacteria suggested the interference of antibacterial principles with central carbohydrate metabolic pathways. Thin layer chromatographic separation followed by GC-MS analysis of EA fraction suggested numbers of antimicrobial compound production by AE1. In addition, DPPH free radical as well as superoxide radical scavenging assay also suggested strong antioxidant potential of AE1 with an IC50 value of 38.0±1.7 μg/ml and 11.38±1.2 μg/ml respectively. On the basis of above facts it can be concluded that the strain AE1 will be a good source of bioactive compounds having medicinal importance."
https://openalex.org/W2951957742,"The introduction and establishment of fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) in Africa presents a major threat to agriculture in that continent and potentially to the entire Eastern Hemisphere. The species is subdivided into two subpopulations called the R-strain and C-strain that differ in their distribution on different plant hosts. This means that the scope of the economic risk posed by invasive fall armyworm is influenced by whether one or both strains are present. Multiple studies have found mitochondrial markers diagnostic of the two strains throughout Africa but there is substantial disagreement with a nuclear strain marker that makes conclusions about strain composition uncertain. In this study the issue of whether both strains are present in Africa was tested by an assay that can detect strain-biased mating behaviors. Western Hemisphere fall armyworm consistently showed evidence of strain-specific assortative mating in the field that was not found in surveys from multiple locations in Africa. The absence of strain mating biases and the disagreements between the strain diagnostic genetic markers indicates that the R-strain is rare (<1% of the population) or absent in Africa. Instead, it appears that the African fall armyworm populations are dominated by two groups, the C-strain and the descendants of interstrain hybrids. These results suggest that plant hosts associated with the R-strain may not be at high risk of fall armyworm infestation in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2929854681,"The genital tract of African women has been shown to differ from what is currently accepted as ‘normal’, defined by a pH≤4.5 and lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) from sub-Saharan Africa are at high risk for HIV, and we hypothesized that specific biological factors are likely to be influential. This study aimed to compare characteristics of vaginal health in HIV-negative AGYW (16-22-years-old), from two South African communities, to international norms. We measured plasma hormones, vaginal pH, presence of BV (Nugent scoring), sexually transmitted infections (multiplex PCR for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) and candidiasis (Gram stain) in AGYW (n = 298) from Cape Town and Soweto. Cervicovaginal microbiota was determined by 16S pyrosequencing; 44 genital cytokines were measured by Luminex; and cervical T-cell activation/proliferation (CCR5, HLA-DR, CD38, Ki67) was measured by multiparametric flow cytometry. 90/298 (30.2%) AGYW were negative for BV, candidiasis and bacterial STIs. L. crispatus and L. iners were the dominant bacteria in cervicovaginal swabs, and the median vaginal pH was 4.7. AGYW with L. crispatus-dominant microbiota (42.4%) generally had the lowest cytokine concentrations compared to women with more diverse microbiota (34/44 significantly upregulated cytokines). Frequencies of CCR5+CD4+ T-cells co-expressing CD38 and HLA-DR correlated positively with interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α, GRO-α, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, and IL-9. While endogenous oestrogen had an immune-dampening effect on IL-6, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and IL-16, injectable hormone contraceptives (DMPA and Net-EN) were associated with significantly lower endogenous hormone concentrations (p<0.0001 for oestrogen and progesterone) and upregulation of 34/44 cytokines. Since genital inflammation and the presence of activated CD4+ T cells in the genital tract have been implicated in increased HIV risk in South African women, the observed high levels of genital cellular activation and cytokines from AGYW may point towards biological factors increasing HIV risk in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2932117905,"Root growth angle (RGA) in response to gravity controlled by auxin is a pertinent target trait for obtainment of higher yield in cereals. But molecular basis of this root architecture trait remain obscure in wheat and barley. We selected four cultivars two each for wheat and barley to unveil the molecular genetic mechanism of Deeper Rooting 1-like gene which controls RGA in rice leading to higher yield under drought imposition. Morphological analyses revealed a deeper and vertically oriented root growth in ""NARC 2009"" variety of wheat than ""Galaxy"" and two other barley cultivars ""Scarlet"" and ""ISR42-8"". Three new homoeologs designated as TaANDRO1-like, TaBNDRO1-like and TaDNDRO1-like corresponding to A, B and D genomes of wheat could be isolated from ""NARC 2009"". Due to frameshift and intronization/exonization events the gene structures of these paralogs exhibit variations in size. DRO1-like genes with five distinct domains prevail in diverse plant phyla from mosses to angiosperms but in lower plants their differentiation from LAZY, NGR and TAC1 (root and shoot angle genes) is enigmatic. Instead of IGT as denominator motif of this family, a new C-terminus motif WxxTD in the V-domain is proposed as family specific motif. The EAR-like motif IVLEM at the C-terminus of the TaADRO1-like and TaDDRO1-like that diverged to KLHTLIPNK in TaBDRO1-like and HvDRO1-like is the hallmark of these proteins. Split-YFP and yeast two hybrid assays complemented the interaction of TaDRO1-like with TOPLESS-a repressor of auxin regulated root promoting genes in plants-through IVLEM/KLHTLIPNK motif. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed abundance of DRO1-like RNA in root tips and spikelets while transcript signals were barely detectable in shoot and leaf tissues. Interestingly, wheat exhibited stronger expression of TaBDRO1-like than barley (HvDRO1-like), but TaBDRO1-like was the least expressing among three paralogs. The underlying cause of this expression divergence seems to be the presence of AuxRE motif TGTCTC and core TGTC with a coupling AuxRE-like motif ATTTTCTT proximal to the transcriptional start site in TaBDRO1-like and HvDRO1-like promoters. This is evident from binding of ARF1 to TGTCTC and TGTC motifs of TaBDRO1-like as revealed by yeast one-hybrid assay. Thus, evolution of DRO1-like wheat homoeologs might incorporate the C-terminus mutations as well as gain and loss of AuxREs and other cis-regulatory elements during expression divergence. Since root architecture is an important target trait for wheat crop improvement, therefore DRO1-like genes have potential applications in plant breeding for enhancement of plant productivity by the use of modern genome editing approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2925458287,"Indonesia is the fifth largest cocoa-producing country in the world, and an increase in cocoa farming efficiency can help farmers to increase their per capita income and reduce poverty in rural areas of this country. This research evaluated the efficiency of Indonesian cocoa farms using a non-parametric approach. The results revealed that the majority of cocoa farms are operated relatively inefficiently. The average technical and allocative efficiencies (0.82 and 0.46, respectively) of these cocoa farms demonstrated that there is potential for improvement. The potential cost reductions range from 36 to 76%, with an average of 60%, if farmers practice efficiently. The technical and allocative efficiencies and cocoa farm economies are affected by the use of quality seeds, organic fertilizers, frequency of extension and training of farm managers, access to bank credit and the market, the participation of women, and the farm manager’s gender. An increase in the output would increase farmers’ income and reduce poverty in rural areas. This research suggests that the availability of extension and training provided to farmers as well as support for women farmer groups should be increased. Credit programs are also important for cocoa farmers, so policymakers should develop programs that make production credit more accessible for farmers, especially through cooperatives and banks."
https://openalex.org/W2931255736,"α7 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) reportedly reduce inflammation by blocking effects of the important pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of B cells (NFκB). The α7 nAChR partial agonist GTS-21 reduces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) in models of endotoxemia and sepsis, and its anti-inflammatory effects are widely ascribed to α7 nAChR activation. However, mechanistic details of α7 nAChR involvement in GTS-21 effects on inflammatory pathways remain unclear. Here, we investigate how GTS-21 acts in two cell systems including the non-immune rat pituitary cell line GH4C1 expressing an NFκB-driven reporter gene and cytokine secretion by ex vivo cultures of primary mouse macrophages activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GTS-21 does not change TNF-stimulated NFκB signaling in GH4C1 cells expressing rat α7 nAChRs, suggesting that GTS-21 requires additional unidentified factors besides α7 nAChR expression to allow anti-inflammatory effects in these cells. In contrast, GTS-21 dose-dependently suppresses LPS-induced IL6 and TNF secretion in primary mouse macrophages endogenously expressing α7 nAChRs. GTS-21 also blocks TNF-induced phosphorylation of NFκB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), an important intermediary in NFκB signaling. However, α7 antagonists methyllycaconitine and α-bungarotoxin only partially reverse GTS-21 blockade of IL6 and TNF secretion. Further, GTS-21 significantly inhibited LPS-induced IL6 and TNF secretion in macrophages isolated from knockout mice lacking α7 nAChRs. These data indicate that even though a discrete component of the anti-inflammatory effects of GTS-21 requires expression of α7 nAChRs in macrophages, GTS-21 also has anti-inflammatory effects independent of these receptors depending on the cellular context."
https://openalex.org/W2932226912,"The flipped classroom (FC) is a pedagogical approach that means that the activities that have traditionally taken place within the classroom are carried out outside the classroom. Fundamentally it implies the way in which the student studies the subject. This change of perspective in teaching-learning has raised many questions regarding its effectiveness and student satisfaction in the university studies in the degree of Social Work.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Flipped Classroom methodology in the academic performance of students of the Social Work Degree.An educational study, with two parallel groups was developed. The randomization was carried out by class groups. Group 1 was assigned an active teaching methodology of Flip Teaching and it was implemented during theoretical teaching hours. The other group of students, Group 2, was assigned a traditional lecturer-based learning (LB) methodology. The participants were all the students of the morning shift who studied the subject Social Work with Groups of the Social Work Degree during the academic year 2017-2018. The sample was composed of 110 subjects, with 60 subjects who developed an active teaching methodology and 50 subjects who received a LB.In terms of the academic performance result variable, the FT group had a mean of 6.56 (SD: 1.58) and the LB group had a mean of 5.42 (SD: 1.97) (p-value: 0.002). The FT group also had a higher percentage of students receiving merit and outstanding scores (34.5% and 6.9% respectively) and a lower percentage of students who failed (19%) as compared to the LB group in which 20.9% and 2.3% of the students received merit or outstanding grades and 46.5% failed (p-value = 0.025). No significant differences were found with regards to satisfaction with the subject and the methodology used, long-term learning and time spent preparing for the exam.The FC teaching methodology in comparison with the LB methodology has shown to be a more effective tool regarding academic performance evaluated in a quantitative and qualitative way with regards to Social Work education at university level."
https://openalex.org/W2932680218,"A field experiment was conducted at the experimental farm of CSIR-Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology, Palampur, India for two consecutive years (2015–16 and 2016–17). The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis whether different shade level and mulch type would influence the growth, flower yield and essential oil profile of R. damascena. Yield attributes viz., numbers of flowers plant-1, fresh flower weight plant-1, flower yield, and essential oil yield were significantly higher under open sunny conditions as compared to 25% and 50% shade levels. However, plants grown under 50% shade level recorded significantly higher plant height (cm), plant spread (cm) and the lowest numbers of branches as compared to control. Among mulches, black polyethylene mulch recorded significantly higher growth, and yield attributes of damask rose as compared to other mulches. Black polyethylene mulch recorded 74.5 and 39.2% higher fresh flower yield as compared to without mulch, during 2015–16 and 2016–17, respectively. Correlation studies showed a positively significant correlation between quality and quantity traits. A total of twenty-six essential oil compounds were identified which accounted for a total of 88.8 to 95.3%. Plants grown under open sunny conditions along with the applications of black polyethylene mulch produced a higher concentration of citronellol and trans-geraniol. Damask rose planted in open sunny conditions and mulched with black polyethylene sheet recorded significantly higher flower yield."
https://openalex.org/W2926354623,"The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and patterns of alcohol use among U.S. Hispanic/Latino adults of diverse backgrounds. The population-based Hispanic Community Health Study/ Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) enrolled a cohort of Hispanic/Latino adults (N = 16,415) ages 18-74 years at time of recruitment, from four US metropolitan areas between 2008-11. Drinking patterns and socio-demographics questionnaires were administered as part of the baseline examination. The relationship between age, sex, socio-demographics, acculturation, current alcohol use, and alcohol risk disorder, defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) [no risk (i.e., never drinker), low risk (i.e., women<7 drinks/week; men<14 drinks/week), and at-risk (i.e., women>7 drinks/week; men>14 drinks/week)] were assessed in unadjusted and adjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses. Men reported a higher prevalence than women of at-risk drinking. For women, increased odds of at-risk alcohol use was associated with: a younger age, greater education, full-time employment, and acculturation after adjustment. For men, having a lower income (vs. higher income) or a higher income (vs. not reported) and being employed fulltime (vs. retired) was associated with at-risk alcohol use. For both men and women, there were variations in odds of at-risk drinking across Hispanic/Latino heritage backgrounds, after adjustment. Exact values, odds ratios and p-values are reported within the text. Common factors across sex associated with at-risk drinking included being of Mexican background and being employed full-time. Intervention strategies should consider diversity within the Hispanic/Latino community when designing alcohol abuse prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2934882821,"The team tactical system and distribution of the football players on the pitch is considered fundamental in team performance. The present study used time-motion analysis and triaxial-accelerometers to obtain new insights about the impact of different tactical systems (1-4-5-1 and 1-3-5-2) on physical performance, across different playing positions, in a professional football team. Player performance data in fifteen official home matches was collected for analysis. The sample included twenty-two players from five playing positions (centre backs: n = 4; full-back/wide midfielder/ wing-back: n = 9; centre midfielder: n = 6 and centre forward: n = 3), making a total of 108 match observations. A novel finding was that general match physical demands do not differ considerably between these tactical formations, probably because match-to-match variability (variation of players' running profile from match-to-match) might be higher than the differences in physical performance between tactical systems. However, change of formation had a different impact across playing positions, with centre backs playing in 1-4-5-1 performing significant more HIRcounts than in 1-3-5-2 (p = 0.031). Furthermore, a medium effect size (r = 0.33) was observed in HIRdist, with wide players covering higher distances when playing in 1-3-5-2 than in 1-4-5-1. These findings may help coaches to develop individualised training programs to meet the demands of each playing position according to the tactical system adopted."
https://openalex.org/W2930679725,"Fractures in horses-whether simple fractures with just one clean break, or incomplete greenstick with stress fractures, or complications such as shattered bones can all be either minimal or even catastrophic. Thus, improvement in fracture healing is a hallmark in equine orthopedics. The fracture healing process implements a complex sequence of events including the initial inflammatory phase removing damaged tissue, re-establishment of vessels and mesenchymal stromal cells, a soft and hard callus phase closing the fracture gap as well as the remodeling phase shaping the bone to a scar-free tissue. Detailed knowledge on processes in equine fracture healing in general and on the initial phase in particular is apparently very limited. Therefore, we generated equine in vitro fracture hematoma models (FH models) to study time-dependent changes in cell composition and RNA-expression for the most prominent cells in the FH model (immune cells, mesenchymal stromal cells) under conditions most closely adapted to the in vivo situation (hypoxia) by using flow cytometry and qPCR. In order to analyze the impact of mesenchymal stromal cells in greater detail, we also incubated blood clots without the addition of mesenchymal stromal cells under the same conditions as a control. We observed a superior survival capacity of mesenchymal stromal cells over immune cells within our FH model maintained under hypoxia. Furthermore, we demonstrate an upregulation of relevant angiogenic, osteogenic and hypoxia-induced markers within 48 h, a time well-known to be crucial for proper fracture healing."
https://openalex.org/W2931971719,"Due to their ability to preferentially induce cell death in tumor cells, while sparing healthy cells, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and agonistic anti-TRAIL-R1 or anti-TRAIL-R2-specific antibodies are under clinical investigations for cancer-treatment. However, TRAIL-Rs may also induce signaling pathways, which result in malignant progression. TRAIL receptors are transcriptionally upregulated via wild-type p53 following radio- or chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the impact of p53 status on the expression and signaling of TRAIL-Rs is not fully understood. Therefore, we analyzed side by side apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling induced by TRAIL or the agonistic TRAIL-R-specific antibodies Mapatumumab (anti-TRAIL-R1) and Lexatumumab (anti-TRAIL-R2) in the two isogenic colon carcinoma cell lines HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/-. We found that HCT116 p53+/+ cells were significantly more sensitive to TRAIL-R-triggering than p53-/- cells. Similarly, A549 lung cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 were more sensitive to TRAIL-R-mediated cell death than their derivatives with knockdown of p53. Our data demonstrate that the contribution of p53 in regulating TRAIL-R-induced apoptosis does not correlate to the levels of TRAIL-Rs at the plasma membrane, but rather to p53-mediated upregulation of Bax, favouring the mitochondrial amplification loop. Consistently, stronger caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation as well as PARP-cleavage was observed following TRAIL-R-triggering in HCT116 p53+/+ compared to HCT116 p53-/- cells. Interestingly, HCT116 p53+/+ cells showed also a more potent activation of non-canonical TRAIL-R-induced signal transduction pathways like JNK, p38 and ERK1/ERK2 than p53-/- cells. Likewise, these cells induced IL-8 expression in response to TRAIL, Mapatumumab or Lexatumumab significantly stronger than p53-/- cells. We obtained similar results in A549 cells with or without p53-knockdown and in the two isogenic colon cancer cell lines RKO p53+/+ and p53-/-. In both cellular systems, we could clearly demonstrate the potentiating effects of p53 on TRAIL-R-mediated IL-8 induction. In conclusion, we found that wild-type p53 increases TRAIL-R-mediated apoptosis but simultaneously augments non-apoptotic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2931911156,"China's rapid urbanization and high traffic accident frequency have received many researchers’ attention. It is important to reveal how urban infrastructures and other risk factors affects the traffic accident frequency. A growing amount of research has examined the local risk factors impact on traffic accident frequency at certain time. Some studies considered these spatial influences but overlooked the temporal correlation/heterogeneity of traffic accidents and related risk factors. This study explores risk factors’ influence on urban traffic accidents frequency while considering both the spatial and temporal correlation/heterogeneity of traffic accidents. The study area is split into 100 equally sized rectangle traffic analysis zones (TAZs), and the urban traffic accident frequency and attributes in each TAZ are extracted. The linear regression model, spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM) and time-fixed effects error model (T-FEEM) are established and compared respectively. The proposed methodologies are illustrated using ten-month traffic accident data from the urban area of Guiyang City, China. The results reveal that the time-fixed effects error model, which considers both spatial and temporal correlation/heterogeneity of traffic accidents, is superior to other models. More traffic accidents will happen in those TAZs that have more hospitals or schools. Moreover, hospitals have a greater influence on traffic accidents than schools. Because of the location in the margin of the city, those TAZs that have passenger stations have more traffic accidents. This study provides policy makers with more detailed characterization about the impact of related risk factors on traffic accident frequencies, and it is suggested that not only the spatial correlation/heterogeneity but also the temporal correlation/heterogeneity should be taken into account in guiding traffic accident control of urban area."
https://openalex.org/W2904860283,"Miniaturized microscopes are lightweight imaging devices that allow optical recordings from neurons in freely moving animals over the course of weeks. Despite their ubiquitous use, individual neuronal responses measured with these microscopes have not been directly compared to those obtained with established in vivo imaging techniques such as bench-top two-photon microscopes. To achieve this, we performed calcium imaging in mouse primary visual cortex while presenting animals with drifting gratings. We identified the same neurons in image stacks acquired with both microscopy methods and quantified orientation tuning of individual neurons. The response amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio of calcium transients recorded upon visual stimulation were highly correlated between both microscopy methods, although influenced by neuropil contamination in miniaturized microscopy. Tuning properties, calculated for individual orientation tuned neurons, were strongly correlated between imaging techniques. Thus, neuronal tuning features measured with a miniaturized microscope are quantitatively similar to those obtained with a two-photon microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2929128306,"Introduction Antepartum depression is a contributing factor for adverse maternal and perinatal outcome. The study aimed to assess the antepartum depressive symptoms in selected public health facilities of Nepal. Methodology This is a mixed-method cross-sectional study that included 143 pregnant women attending the antenatal checkup in four public health facilities of Kathmandu. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) tool with cut-off score > = 10 was used to assess the antepartum depressive symptoms. Bivariate and multivariable analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with the depressive symptoms. Further semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 pregnant women identified with the depressive symptoms. Result Of the total 143 pregnant women, 26 (18%, CI at 95% 12.6–25.5) reported depressive symptoms. Multivariable analysis reported higher odds of antepartum depressive-symptoms with health problem, early gestational age, sex preference, and spousal alcohol intake. Thematic analysis of qualitative data further revealed participants’ apprehension on; birth outcome, a family expectation of male child, inadequate support from the family/husband and disturbed family environment. Conclusion Notable proportion of pregnant women were reported with antepartum depressive symptoms. Women’s perception on patriarchal values for childbirth was revealed to be important factor for the depressive symptoms. The study draws an attention to a need for screening for antepartum depression into primary health care system. Strengthening ongoing efforts on gender equity could contribute the psychological well-being of pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W2934475669,"We demonstrate widening socioeconomic disparities in perceived economic distress among Americans, characterized by increasing distress at the bottom and improved perceptions at the top of the socioeconomic ladder. We then assess the extent to which hardships related to the Great Recession account for the growing social disparity in economic distress. Based on the concept of loss aversion, we also test whether the psychological pain associated with a financial loss is greater than the perceived benefit of an equivalent gain. Analyses are based on longitudinal survey data from the Midlife Development in the US study. Results suggest that widening social disparities in perceived economic distress between the mid-2000s and mid-2010s are explained in part by differential exposure to hardships related to the Great Recession, the effects of which have lingered even four to five years after the recession officially ended. Yet, auxiliary analyses show that the socioeconomic disparities in economic distress widened by nearly as much (if not more) during the period from 1995–96 to 2004–05 as they did during the period in which the recession occurred, which suggests that the factors driving these trends may have already been in motion prior to the recession. Consistent with the loss aversion hypothesis, perceptions of financial strain appear to be somewhat more strongly affected by losses in income/assets than by gains, but the magnitude of the differentials are small and the results are not robust. Our findings paint a dismal portrait of a growing socioeconomic divide in economic distress throughout the period from the mid-1990s to the mid-2010s, although we cannot say whether these trends afflict all regions of the US equally. Spatial analysis of aggregate-level mortality and objective economic indicators could provide indirect evidence, but ultimately economic “despair” must be measured subjectively by asking people how they perceive their financial situations."
https://openalex.org/W2925919669,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy affecting women of reproductive age, and whose etiology is not well understood yet. In these women, the follicular growth is arrested at preantral stage leading to cyst formation, consequently resulting in anovulatory infertility in these women. As the follicular fluid provides the conducive microenvironment for the growth of oocytes, molecular profiling of the fluid may provide unique information about pathophysiology associated with follicular development in PCOS. Post-translational addition of oligosaccharide residues is one of the many modifications of secreted proteins influencing their functions. These glycoproteins play a significant role in disease pathology. Despite glycoproteins having such essential functions, very limited information is available on their profiling in human reproductive system, and glycoproteomic profile of follicular fluid of women with PCOS is yet unexplored. In the present study, we performed a comparative glycoproteomic analysis of follicular fluid between women with PCOS and controls undergoing in vitro fertilization, by enrichment of glycoproteins using three different lectins viz. concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin and Jacalin. Peptides generated by trypsin digestion were labeled with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification reagents and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 10 differentially expressed glycoproteins, in the follicular fluid of women with PCOS compared to controls. Two important differentially expressed proteins- SERPINA1 and ITIH4, were consistently upregulated and downregulated respectively, upon validation by immunoblotting in follicular fluid and real-time polymerase chain reaction in granulosa cells. These proteins play a role in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix stabilization, vital for follicle maturation. In conclusion, a comparative glycoproteomic profiling of follicular fluid from women with PCOS and controls revealed an altered expression of proteins which may contribute to the defects in follicle development in PCOS pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2930326366,"The Trichophyton rubrum genome contains six proteins containing two or more lysin M (LysM) domains. We have characterized two of these proteins, LysM1 and LysM2, and demonstrated that these proteins have the capacity to bind two substrates, chitin and N-linked oligosaccharides associated with human skin glycoproteins. We have characterized the individual LysM domains in LysM1, and shown that the protein contains two functional LysM domains. Each of these domains can bind to chitin, to N-linked oligosaccharides in human skin glycoproteins, and to N-linked oligosaccharides on fungal glycoproteins. We hypothesize that LysM proteins could provide the pathogen with three important functions. First, the T. rubrum LysM proteins could shield host cell wall chitin from the human immune system. Second, the LysM proteins could shield the pathogen's glycoproteins from host degradation and immune surveillance. Third, the LysM proteins could help facilitate pathogen adhesion to human skin."

These isotherms have been interpreted considering the monolayer as a two dimensional ideal or van der Waals gas without contact with the water phase. These modelistic approaches do not fit the experimental results. Based on Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (TIP), the expansion/compression process is interpreted in terms of coupled phenomena between area changes and water fluxes between a bidimensional solution of hydrated head groups in the monolayer and the bulk solution. The formalism obtained can reproduce satisfactorily the surface pressure/area per lipid isotherms of monolayer in different states and also can explain the area expansion and compression produced in particles enclosed by bilayers during osmotic fluxes. This novel approach gives relevance to the lipid-water interaction in restricted media near the membrane and provides a formalism to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic response of biointerphases to biological effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2931157775,"Chemotherapy often causes side effects that include disturbances in taste functions. Cyclophosphamide (CYP) is a chemotherapy drug that, after a single dose, elevates murine taste thresholds at times related to drug-induced losses of taste sensory cells and disruptions of proliferating cells that renew taste sensory cells. Pretreatment with amifostine can protect the taste system from many of these effects. This study compared the effects of a single dose (75 mg/kg) of CYP with effects generated by fractionated dosing of CYP (5 doses of 15 mg/kg), a dosing approach often used during chemotherapy, on the taste system of mice using immunohistochemistry. Dose fractionation prolonged the suppressive effects of CYP on cell proliferation responsible for renewal of taste sensory cells. Fractionation also reduced the total number of cells and the proportion of Type II cells within taste buds. The post-injection time of these losses coincided with the life span of Type I and II taste cells combined with lack of replacement cells. Fractionated dosing also decreased Type III cells more than a single dose, but loss of these cells may be due to factors related to the general health and/or cell renewal of taste buds rather than the life span of Type III cells. In general, pretreatment with amifostine appeared to protect taste cell renewal and the population of cells within taste buds from the cytotoxic effects of CYP with few observable adverse effects due to repeated administration. These findings may have important implications for patients undergoing chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2927622065,"Objective To identify trends of patients’ urinary and sexual dysfunctions from a clinical and psychological perspective and understand whether sociodemographic and medical predictors could differentiate among patients following different one-year longitudinal trajectories. Methods An Italian sample of 478 prostate cancer patients undergone Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy completed the EPIC-26 survey between July 2015 and July 2016 at the pre-hospitalization (T0), 45 days (T1) and 3 (T2), 6 (T3), 9 (T4), and 12 months (T5) after surgery. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (age, BMI, diabetes, nerve-sparing procedure) were also collected. Latent Class Growth Analysis was conducted separately for sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence EPIC-26 subscales. The association between membership in the two longitudinal trajectories of urinary and sexual dysfunctions was assessed by considering Chi-square test and its related contingency table. Results People who have a high level of urinary incontinence at T1 are likely to have a worse recovery. Age, BMI and pre-surgical continence may affect the level of incontinence at T1 and the recovery trajectories. Patients with low and moderate sexual problems at T1 can face a moderate linear recovery, while people with high level of impotence immediately after surgery may take a longer period to solve sexual dysfunctions. Age and the pre-surgical sexual condition may impact the recovery. Finally, a great proportion of patients reported both steady problems in sexual function and constant high levels of urinary incontinence over time. Conclusions This study highlights different categories of patients at risk who may be important to know in order to develop personalized medical pathways and predictive models in a value-based healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W2952149375,"Over the past few years, the field of visual social cognition and face processing has been dramatically impacted by a series of data-driven studies employing computer-graphics tools to synthesize arbitrary meaningful facial expressions. In the auditory modality, reverse correlation is traditionally used to characterize sensory processing at the level of spectral or spectro-temporal stimulus properties, but not higher-level cognitive processing of e.g. words, sentences or music, by lack of tools able to manipulate the stimulus dimensions that are relevant for these processes. Here, we present an open-source audio-transformation toolbox, called CLEESE, able to systematically randomize the prosody/melody of existing speech and music recordings. CLEESE works by cutting recordings in small successive time segments (e.g. every successive 100 milliseconds in a spoken utterance), and applying a random parametric transformation of each segment’s pitch, duration or amplitude, using a new Python-language implementation of the phase-vocoder digital audio technique. We present here two applications of the tool to generate stimuli for studying intonation processing of interrogative vs declarative speech, and rhythm processing of sung melodies."
https://openalex.org/W2930771079,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by β-cell damage and hyperglycaemia. The lipophilic drug, probucol, has shown significant β-cell protective and potential antidiabetic effects, which were enhanced by hydrophilic bile acid incorporation using taurocholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. However, probucol has severe cardiotoxicity and a variable absorption profile, which limit its potential applications in T2D. Accordingly, this study aimed to design multiple formulations to optimise probucol oral delivery in T2D and test their effects on probucol absorption and accumulation in the heart. Adult male mice were given a high fat diet (HFD), and a week later, injected with a single dose of alloxan to accelerate T2D development, and once diabetes confirmed, divided into three groups (six to seven mice each). The groups were gavaged a daily dose of probucol powder, probucol microcapsules, or probucol-bile acid microcapsules for three months, and euthanized; and blood, tissues, and feces collected for blood glucose and probucol concentration analyses. Probucol concentrations in plasma were similar among all the groups. Groups given probucol microcapsules and probucol-bile acid microcapsules showed significant reduction in probucol accumulation in the heart compared with the group given probucol powder (p<0.05). Probucol microencapsulation with or without bile acids reduced its accumulation in heart tissues, without changing plasma concentrations, which may be beneficial in reducing its cardiotoxicity and optimise its potential applications in T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2933731341,"Objective The objective of this study was to describe the age and sex-specific prevalence of renal insufficiency, and observe its trends over a decade at an urban Bangladesh setup. Method This was a cross-sectional study, in which we observed the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) of 218,888 adults, aged ≥19 years, who had submitted their blood specimen to the Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) during the years 2006–2015. We applied CKD-EPI definition in estimating eGFR using their age-and sex-specific serum creatinine concentrations. Based on the eGFR, we classified the population into five stages of renal insufficiency (stage-1 to stage-5), at age intervals of five-years. Data were analysed using the Linear Regression and Multinomial Logistic Regression models. Results Females constituted 43% (n = 94,931) of the study population; and 34% (n = 42,576) of the males and 31% (n = 29,830) of the females had their serum creatinine concentrations above the upper limit of the laboratory reference cut-off. The overall prevalence of stage-2 to stage-5 renal insufficiency were 24% (n = 52,126), 17% (n = 38,539), 8% (n = 16,504) and 6% (n = 12,665) respectively; the prevalence were 23% (n = 1,890), 19% (n = 1,579), 9% (n = 769) and 9% (n = 770) respectively in 2006, and 24% (n = 10,062), 17% (n = 6,903), 6% (n = 2,537) and 5% (n = 1,924) respectively in 2015. The prevalence was higher among the females. At least 2% of the adults, younger than <44 years, had stage-4 and stage-5 in 2015. The age-adjusted eGFR was significantly lower among the post-menopausal females (aged ≥46 y) compared to the same age group males (64.08±10.83 vs. 66.83±10.41 mL/min/1.73 m2; p<0.001). Compared to 2006, the number of individuals with renal insufficiency (stage 2 and above) had increased at least two times, irrespective of age, in 2015. A single year of increase in the age was significantly associated with 1.32 unit reductions in the eGFR; and the reductions were higher for females who also had higher odds of renal insufficiency stages-2 and beyond. Conclusion This study observed high prevalence of stage-2 to stage-5 renal insufficiency in Bangladeshi populations, irrespective of age, and especially among the females."
https://openalex.org/W2935013867,"Skeletal muscles include fast and slow muscle fibers. The tibialis anterior muscle (TA) is mainly composed of fast muscle fibers, whereas the soleus muscle (SOL) is mainly composed of slow muscle fibers. However, a noninvasive approach for appropriately investigating the characteristics of muscles is not available. Monitoring of skeletal muscle characteristics can help in the evaluation of the effects of strength training and diseases on skeletal muscles.The present study aimed to determine whether q-space imaging can distinguish between TA and SOL in in vivo mice.In vivo magnetic resonance imaging of the right calves of mice (n = 8) was performed using a 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system with a cryogenic probe. TA and SOL were assessed. q-space imaging was performed with a field of view of 10 mm × 10 mm, matrix of 48 × 48, and section thickness of 1000 μm. There were ten b-values ranging from 0 to 4244 s/mm2, and each b-value had diffusion encoding in three directions. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were compared with immunohistological findings.Full width at half maximum and Kurtosis maps of q-space imaging showed signal intensities consistent with immunohistological findings for both fast (myosin heavy chain II) and slow (myosin heavy chain I) muscle fibers. With regard to quantification, both full width at half maximum and Kurtosis could represent the immunohistological findings that the cell diameter of TA was larger than that of SOL (P < 0.01).q-space imaging could clearly differentiate TA from SOL using differences in cell diameters. This technique is a promising method to noninvasively estimate the fiber type ratio in skeletal muscles, and it can be further developed as an indicator of muscle characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2926901079,"Nine patients with recurrent head and neck (H&N) cancer received boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in one fraction at the Tsing-Hua Open pool reactor (THOR) utilizing the THORplan treatment planning system (TPS). The aims of the present study were to evaluate the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of 45 Gy in 20 fractions to compensate for the dose heterogeneity in gross tumor volume observed with single-fraction BNCT with mean prescription dose 19 Gy (w), and to evaluate planning quality indices of simulated BNCT+IMRT versus single-fraction BNCT alone. All IMRT plans were generated using the Eclipse TPS which employs the analytical anisotropic algorithm. The conformity index for the gross tumor volume (GTV) was better for the BNCT+IMRT plan than for the BNCT-alone plan (p = 0.003). In addition, the BNCT+IMRT plan provided significantly better homogeneity in the GTV (p = 0.03). The cold spots in inhomogeneous dose distribution in the BNCT plan may be a key factor for H&N cancer recurrence. Our results suggest that single-fraction BNCT combined with compensated multi-fraction IMRT improves treatment homogeneity and conformity than single-fraction BNCT alone, especially for tumor volumes >100 cm3, and possibly increases local tumor control."
https://openalex.org/W2929211900,"We recently demonstrated that asphyxiated piglets commonly had bradycardia displayed on electrocardiography (ECG) while no carotid blood flow (CBF) or audible heart sounds could be detected. Such pulseless electrical activity (PEA) in newborn infants has not previously been thoroughly described. The aim of this study was to further investigate the occurrence of non-perfusing cardiac rhythms in asphyxiated piglets and the potential implications for the success of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and short-term survival.Neonatal piglets (1-4 days, 1.7-2.4kg) had their right common carotid artery exposed and enclosed with a real-time ultrasonic flow probe. Heart rate (HR) was continuously measured and recorded using ECG. This allowed simultaneous monitoring of HR via ECG and CBF. The piglets were asphyxiated until cardiac arrest, defined as no CBF and no audible beat upon precordial auscultation. CPR was performed until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, defined as a HR ≥100 bpm). ECG traces were retrospectively assessed.Nine out of 21 piglets (43%) had QRS-complexes on their ECG while no CBF and no audible heart sounds could be detected. Five (56%) of the piglets with PEA and 12/12 (100%) piglets with asystole at cardiac arrest obtained ROSC (p = 0.02). Thirty-three per cent of the piglets with PEA versus 58% with asystole survived to 4 hours post-ROSC (p = 0.39).Cardiac arrest in the presence of a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm on ECG is common in asphyxiated piglets. Clinical arrest in the presence of a non-perfusing cardiac rhythm on ECG may reduce the success of CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2928413744,"As a special kind of handwriting with a brush, Chinese calligraphic handwriting (CCH) requires a large amount of practice with high levels of concentration and emotion regulation. Previous studies have showed that long-term CCH training has positive effects physically (induced by handwriting activities) and psychologically (induced by the state of relaxation and concentration), the latter of which is similar to the effects of meditation. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term CCH training effect on anxiety and attention, as well as brain structure. Participants were 32 individuals who had at least five years of CCH experience and 44 controls. Results showed that CCH training benefited individuals' selective and divided attention but did not decrease their anxiety level. Moreover, the VBM analysis showed that long-term CCH training was mainly associated with smaller grey matter volumes (GMV) in the right precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). No brain areas showed larger GMV in the CCH group than the control group. Using two sets of regions of interest (ROIs), one related to meditation and the other to handwriting, ROI analysis showed significant differences between the CCH and the control group only at the meditation-related ROIs, not at the handwriting-related ROIs. Finally, for the whole sample, the GMV of both the whole brain and the PCC were negatively correlated with selective attention and divided attention. The present study was cross-sectional and had a relatively small sample size, but its results suggested that CCH training might benefit attention and influence particular brain structure through mental processes such as meditation."
https://openalex.org/W2932828537,"Introduction The aim of this study is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system to identify subjects at differing stages of development of multiple sclerosis (MS) using multifocal visual-evoked potentials (mfVEPs). Using an automatic classifier, diagnosis is performed first on the eyes and then on the subjects. Patients MfVEP signals were obtained from patients with Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) (n = 30 eyes), patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) (n = 62 eyes), patients with definite MS (n = 56 eyes) and 22 control subjects (n = 44 eyes). The CIS and MS groups were divided into two subgroups: those with eyes affected by optic neuritis (ON) and those without (non-ON). Methods For individual eye diagnosis, a feature vector was formed with information about the intensity, latency and singular values of the mfVEP signals. A flat multiclass classifier (FMC) and a hierarchical classifier (HC) were tested and both were implemented using the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm. The output of the best eye classifier was used to classify the subjects. In the event of divergence, the eye with the best mfVEP recording was selected. Results In the eye classifier, the HC performed better than the FMC (accuracy = 0.74 and extended Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) = 0.68). In the subject classification, accuracy = 0.95 and MCC = 0.93, confirming that it may be a promising tool for MS diagnosis. Conclusion In addition to amplitude (axonal loss) and latency (demyelination), it has shown that the singular values of the mfVEP signals provide discriminatory information that may be used to identify subjects with differing degrees of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2934222923,"The extent to which a good person-environment (PE) interest fit between student and study program leads to better study results in higher education is an ongoing debate wherein the role of the study program environment has remained inadequately studied. Unanswered questions include: how diverse study programs are in the interests of their student populations, and how this program interest diversity influences study results, in comparison to individual PE fit? The present study addressed these questions in students (N = 4,635) enrolled in open-access university education. In such an open access system, students are allowed to make study choices without prior limitations based on previous achievement or high stakes testing. Starting from the homogeneity assumption applied to this open access setting, we propose several hypotheses regarding program interest diversity, motivation, student-program interest fit, and study results. Furthermore, we applied a method of measuring interest diversity based on an existing measure of correlational person-environment fit. Results indicated that interest diversity in an open access study environment was low across study programs. Results also showed the variance present in program interest diversity was linked to autonomous and controlled motivation in the programs’ student populations. Finally, program interest diversity better explained study results than individual student fit with their program of choice. Indeed, program interest diversity explained up to 44% of the variance in the average program’s study results while individual student-program fit hardly predicted study success at all. Educational policy makers should therefore be aware of the importance of both interest fit and interest diversity during the process of study orientation."

The aim of this analysis was to determine whether O blood type is associated with higher early postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) risk as compared to other blood types. Study design In this retrospective case-control study, data was gathered form 4,516 deliveries occurring at our institution between 2014 and 2016. Cases were categorized into one of two groups according to women’s major blood type (O or non-O), and thereafter according to minor blood type (RH positive or negative). The primary outcome was early PPH which was further stratified by clinical severity according to the decrement in hemoglobin concentration after delivery. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test while continuous variables were compared using the student's t-test. All data were further analyzed using a stepwise logistic regression model. Results 1,594 (35.3%) of 4,516 women included in this analysis had O blood type. Early PPH occurred in 44 women (2.7%) with O blood type and 65 women (2.22%) with other blood types. O blood type was not associated with an increased risk for early PPH (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.84–1.82, P = 0.275). This lack of association remained unchanged after stratification by PPH severity. There was also no significant association between Rh blood type and the risk for early PPH (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44–1.4, P = 0.422). Conclusions In this cohort, O blood type was not associated with an increased risk for early PPH."
https://openalex.org/W2930593922,"Objective Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients with massive organomegaly suffer from pressure-related complications including malnutrition. In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for objective and quantitative nutritional assessment in ADPKD patients Design and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study, to evaluate the clinical utility of segmental BIA for assessing the nutritional status of ADPKD patients. BIA measurements was assessed according to modified subjective global assessment (SGA) scores and were compared with data from a healthy population. The association between BIA measurements and the height adjusted kidney and liver volumes (htTKLV), were analyzed. Subjects A total of 288 ADPKD patients, aged ≥ 18 years old, were analyzed Main outcome measures Nutritional status was evaluated with SGA and segmental BIA. The htTKLV were measured in each patients using computed tomonography images. Results Higher ratios of extracellular water to total body water (ECW/TBW) in the whole-body (ECW/TBWWB), trunk (ECW/TBWTR), and lower extremities (ECW/TBWLE) and lower phase angle of lower extremities (PhALE) correlated with lower SGA scores in the ADPKD population and in both gender. The four parameters, ECW/TBWWB, ECW/TBWTR, and ECW/TBWLE of >0.38 and PhALE of <5.8 θ were associated with malnutrition in ADPKD patients. These correlations were preserved in the subgroup analysis for chronic kidney disease stages 1-3A. Compared to healthy populations’ data, body fluid parameters and segmental ECW/TBW values, except for the upper extremities (ECW/TBWUE), were greater in ADPKD patients. Increased htTKLV was an independent risk factor for malnutrition in ADPKD. The highest correlation with htTKLV was observed for the ECW/TBWTR (r = 0.466), followed by ECW/TBWWB (r = 0.407), ECW/TBWLE (r = 0.385), PhALE (r = -0.279), and PhATR (r = 0.215). Conclusions These results demonstrated that segmental BIA parameters of ECW/TBWWB, ECW/TBWTR, ECW/TBWLE and PhALE provide useful information on nutritional status including the impact of organomegaly in ADPKD."
https://openalex.org/W2928773450,"Background Women have a greater risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) than men do, yet the basis for this disparity remains unclear. Greater arterial stiffness and afterload causes left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, a central mechanism of HFPEF. Because of smaller body habitus, previous reports have used body surface area as a surrogate of the size of the aorta. We performed a comprehensive hemodynamic evaluation of elderly patients with preserved EF and evaluated sex differences in the associations between LV function and afterload, before and after adjusting for the aortic sizes. Methods and results Four hundred and forty-three patients (mean age: 73 years, 169 women) who underwent clinically indicated echocardiography and computed tomography (CT) were identified. Linear regression analyses were performed to assess the independent contributions of sex to and its interaction with LV function before and after adjusting for CT-derived aortic length and volume. Although blood pressures were similar between the sexes, women had greater arterial elastance, lower arterial compliance, and greater LV ejection fraction (all p<0.001). Sex differences were detected in the associations between LV afterload and relaxation (mitral e′) as well as in the left atrial (LA) emptying fraction, but not in LA size. These differences remained significant after adjusting for the aortic length and volume. Sensitivity analyses in an age-matched subgroup (n = 324; 162 of each sex) confirmed the robustness of these sex disparities in LV diastolic function and afterload. Conclusion Women had worse LV relaxation than men did against the same degree of afterload, before and even after adjusting for the aortic sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2925848021,"Background/Aims It is important to identify patients who are refractory to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), which is performed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the predictors of poor treatment outcomes in patients with recurrent HCC treated who were treated with TACE after curative resection. Methods 428 patients with recurrent HCC after curative resection who were treated with TACE were enrolled. Results The median age of the study population was 59.2 years. On multivariate analysis, ≥2 TACE procedures within 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.898), and the des-gamma carboxyprothrombin level (HR = 1.000) independently predicted the progression to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C in patients with BCLC stage 0-B HCC (both P<0.05). In addition, ≥2 and ≥3 TACE procedures within 6 months independently predicted mortality in the entire study population (HR = 1.863 and 1.620, respectively). The probability of progression to BCLC stage C in patients with BCLC stage 0-B HCC and the mortality rate in the entire study population were significantly higher in patients treated with ≥2 TACE within 6 months than in those who underwent fewer procedures (P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively). Conclusions More than 2 TACE procedures within 6 months might be associated with the refractoriness to TACE in patients with recurrent HCC after curative resection."
https://openalex.org/W2931491590,"Neonicotinoids are widely used class of insecticides. Most are seed treatments and during planting active ingredient may be abraded and lost in fugitive dust. Much of this active ingredient contaminates surface waters, exposing aquatic organism to potential ill effects. This study examines concentrations of neonicotinoids appearing in tile drains and open ditches around commercial maize fields around planting time where neonicotinoid seed treatments had been used. This sample set represents surface water leaving the point of origin, for which data are sparse. Clothianidin was found more often than thiamethoxam and at higher concentrations; at a median concentration of 0.35 ng/mL in tile drain water and almost twice that (0.68 ng/mL) in ditches into which the tiles are draining after applications of 19 g/ha on seed. This concentration reveals a 40 to 50 fold dilution for neonicotinoid residues between the points where they leave the field in which they were applied and when they are found in nearby streams in a similar ecosystem. Our data support that for a no-observed-effect concentration of 0.3 ng/mL for thiamethoxam there would be between a 1.6 and 100-fold margin of safety to mayflies in most streams if fugitive dust on pneumatic planters were properly mitigated."
https://openalex.org/W2950106148,"Soils are heterogeneous and microbial spatial distribution can clearly indicate the spatial characteristics of the soil carbon and nitrogen cycle. However, it is not clear how long-term fertilization affects the spatial distribution of microbial biomass in fluvo-aquic soil. We collected fluvo-aquic soil samples (topsoil 0-7.5 cm and sub-topsoil 7.5-20 cm) using a spatially-explicit design within three 40.5 m2 plots in each of four fertilization treatments. Fertilization treatments were: cropping without fertilizer inputs (CK); chemical nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer (NPK); chemical fertilizer with straw return (NPKS); and chemical fertilizer with animal manure (NPKM). Variables included soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), and MBC/MBN. For both soil layers, we hypothesized that: microbial biomass was lowest in CK but with the largest spatial heterogeneity; and microbial biomass was highest in NPKM and NPKS but with the lowest spatial heterogeneity. Results showed that: (1) Fertilization significantly increased MBC and MBN more in topsoil than sub-topsoil but had no MBC/MBN changes. (2) The coefficient of variation (CV) and Cochran's C showed that variation was largest in CK in topsoil and NPK in sub-topsoil and that variation of topsoil was generally lower than in sub-topsoil. The sample size of the three variables was largest in CK in topsoil but had little variation among the other treatments. (3) The trend-surface model showed that within-plot heterogeneity varied substantially with fertilization (NPKM = NPK > NPKS > CK), but Moran's I and the interpolation map showed that spatial variability with fertilization followed the order NPK > NPKS > CK = NPKM at a fine scale in topsoil. In sub-topsoil, the trend-surface model showed that within-plot heterogeneity followed the order NPKM = CK > NPK > NPKS and that the fine-scale pattern was NPKM>NPK = NPKS>CK. MBC had the highest spatial heterogeneity among the three variables in both soil layers. Our results indicate that the application of organic fertilizer (straw or manure) reduced the variation of MBC and MBN but increased the spatial variability of MBC and MBN. The spatial variation of the three variables was MBC > MBN > MBC/MBN regardless of whether variation was considered at the plot-scale or the fine-scale in both layers."

Therefore, the health and education sectors of the study area should work hand in hand to improve the awareness of the community about goiter, iodized salt and iodine rich foods."
https://openalex.org/W2931516320,"Enzymes play a critical role in a wide array of industrial, medical, and research applications and with the recent explosion of genomic sequencing, we now have sequences for millions of enzymes for which there is no known structure. In order to utilize modern computational design tools for constructing inhibitors or engineering novel catalysts, the ability to accurately model enzymes is critical. A popular approach for modeling enzymes are comparative modeling techniques which can often accurately predict the global structural features. However, achieving atomic accuracy of an active site remains a challenge and is an issue when trying to utilize the molecular details for designing inhibitors or enhanced catalysts. Here we explore integrating knowledge about the required geometric orientation of conserved catalytic residues into the comparative modeling process in order to improve modeling accuracy. In order to investigate the utility of adding this information, we first carefully construct a benchmark set of reference structures to use. Consistent with previous findings, our benchmark demonstrates that the geometry between catalytic residues across an enzyme family is conserved and does not tend to deviate by more than 0.5Å. We then find that by integrating these geometric constraints during modeling, we can double the number of atomic level accuracy models (<1Å RMSD to the crystal structure ligand) within our benchmarking dataset, even for targets with templates as low as 20-30% sequence identity. Catalytic residues within an enzyme family are highly conserved and can often be readily identified through comparative sequence analysis to a known structure within the enzyme family. Therefore utilizing this readily available information has the potential to significantly improve drug design and enzyme engineering efforts for which there is no known structure for the enzyme of interest."

A total of 140 subjects were screened between March 2013 and July 2014. All subjects received a questionnaire survey and a health examination that included a physical examination; chest X-ray; and tests for standard pulmonary function, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, serum soluble mesothelin-related peptide (SMRP), fibulin-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and urinary 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)/creatinine. After excluding subjects with uraemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we included 48 subjects with pneumoconiosis and 90 control subjects without pneumoconiosis for analysis. In terms of occupational history, 43/48 (90%) case subjects and 68% (61/90) of the control subjects had processed asbestos-contaminated minerals, including nephrite, antigorite, and talc. The case group had decreased pulmonary function in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of the FVC. The levels of SMRP, fibulin-3, urinary 8-OHdG/creatinine, and CEA were higher in the case group than in the control group. Subjects exposed to nephrite had significantly higher SMRP levels (0.84 ± 0.52 nM) than subjects exposed to other types of minerals (0.60 ± 0.30 nM). A dose-response relationship was observed between the SMRP level and the severity of pneumoconiosis. Machine learning algorithms, including variables of sex, age, SMRP, fibulin-3, CEA, and 8-OHdG/creatinine, can predict pneumoconiosis with high accuracy. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.7 to 1.0. We suggest that SMRP and fibulin-3 could be used as biomarkers of pneumoconiosis in workers exposed to asbestos-contaminated minerals."
https://openalex.org/W2925642273,"Although the distinct distribution of certain molecules along the anterior or posterior edge is essential for directed cell migration, the mechanisms to maintain asymmetric protein localization have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we studied a mechanism for the distinct localizations of two Dictyostelium talin homologues, talin A and talin B, both of which play important roles in cell migration and adhesion. Using GFP fusion, we found that talin B, as well as its C-terminal actin-binding region, which consists of an I/LWEQ domain and a villin headpiece domain, was restricted to the leading edge of migrating cells. This is in sharp contrast to talin A and its C-terminal actin-binding domain, which co-localized with myosin II along the cell posterior cortex, as reported previously. Intriguingly, even in myosin II-null cells, talin A and its actin-binding domain displayed a specific distribution, co-localizing with stretched actin filaments. In contrast, talin B was excluded from regions rich in stretched actin filaments, although a certain amount of its actin-binding region alone was present in those areas. When cells were sucked by a micro-pipette, talin B was not detected in the retracting aspirated lobe where acto-myosin, talin A, and the actin-binding regions of talin A and talin B accumulated. Based on these results, we suggest that talin A predominantly interacts with actin filaments stretched by myosin II through its C-terminal actin-binding region, while the actin-binding region of talin B does not make such distinctions. Furthermore, talin B appears to have an additional, unidentified mechanism that excludes it from the region rich in stretched actin filaments. We propose that these actin-binding properties play important roles in the anterior and posterior enrichment of talin B and talin A, respectively, during directed cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2926630785,"Despite the positive survival trend in infants born prematurely, the risk for development of intracranial lesions has remained unchanged. However, there are limitations to our understanding of the pattern of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -detected brain pathology in the preterm infants surviving to discharge. The present study outlines the type of intracranial lesions and factors allied with the neonatal brain hemorrhage (NBH) and white matter injury (WMI) seen on MRI at term-equivalent age or close to discharge in infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. We obtained demographic and clinical data, and reports of serial cranial ultrasound (CUS) performed during first month of life and qualitative MRI at term-equivalent age or close to discharge. Statistical comparison was conducted with respect to the MRI results that were classified as normal, WMI, and NBH using univariate and logistic regression analysis. One hundred and ninety three infants with MRI at term-equivalent age or close to discharge were included in final analysis. They were less mature and had a higher prevalence of pathological findings on CUS as compared with 249 other survivors born with gestational ages less than 29 weeks during the assigned study period. MRI was normal in 72.5% [95% Confidence Interval (95% CI 65.9%-78.4%)], showed WMI in 9.8% (95%CI 6.4%-14.9%) and NBH in 17.6% (95%CI 12.9-23.6) of the studied infants. Intracranial hemorrhages had also been reported in 42.2% of the infants with WMI. Except for moderate agreement with prior CUS results, no other factors were associated with the MRI detected pathological findings. In general, the likelihood for detection of WMI and NBH on MRI at term-equivalent age or close to discharge was reduced by approximately 80% and 70%, respectively if the serial CUS had not shown any abnormalities during the first month of life."
https://openalex.org/W2928827378,"Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) were found to play a role in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with and without renal impairment. Therefore, preserving the structural stability of GBCAs to reduce their propensity to liberate Gd3+ is of utmost importance. This study evaluates the effect of gadolinium concentration of GBCAs on solution temperature under magnetic fields. It is hypothesized that presence of gadolinium will lead to temperature changes of its solutions under magnetic field, and this change will depend on concentration. In this study, GBCAs were diluted to concentrations of 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 mMol/L. A 10mL preparation in pure water, simulated body fluid (SBF), and plasma was scanned at 3T following a soft tissue neck protocol, and their temperatures were measured. Findings revealed that concentration of GBCA had significant effect on temperature change in all dilution media. Type of commercially available GBCA had an effect only in SFB and plasma. Evaluation of correlation between conditional stability constant (Kcond) and temperature difference (ΔT) revealed that in water and SBF there exists a positive correlation between Kcond and temperature variation. Collectively, GBCAs can cause local temperature variations when administered into patients, and can affect dissociation of gadolinium from its chelates, which should be investigated in a further study."
https://openalex.org/W2931343903,"Some strains of motile bacteria self-organize to form spatial patterns of high and low cell density over length scales that can be observed by eye. One such collective behavior is the formation in semisolid agar media of a high cell density swarm band. We isolated 7 wild strains of the Enterobacter cloacae complex capable of forming this band and found its propagation speed can vary 2.5 fold across strains. To connect such variability in collective motility to strain properties, each strain’s single-cell motility and exponential growth rates were measured. The band speed did not significantly correlate with any individual strain property; however, a multilinear analysis revealed that the band speed was set by a combination of the run speed and tumbling frequency. Comparison of variability in closely-related wild isolates has the potential to reveal how changes in single-cell properties influence the collective behavior of populations."
https://openalex.org/W2931729822,"Few investigators have analyzed fetal ocular growth with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of high magnetic strength. Our purpose is to obtain normative biometrics for fetal ocular development in the second trimester of pregnancy. Sixty specimens with a gestational age (GA) of 12-23 weeks were scanned using a 7.0 T MRI scanner. The linear interocular and binocular distances (IOD and BOD, respectively), globe diameter (GD) and lens diameter (LD) were measured on the transverse section of the largest diameter of the eyeballs. The three dimensional (3D) visualization model of the eyeball was reconstructed with Amira software. Then, the globe and lens volumes (GV and LV, respectively) were obtained. All the measurements were plotted as a function of GA. The fetal ocular structures in the second trimester of pregnancy could be clearly delineated on 7.0 T postmortem MRI images. All the linear measurements logarithmically increased with GA, while, the volumetric measurements linearly increased with GA. Postmortem MRI of high magnetic strength can clearly document fetal ocular growth in the second trimester of pregnancy. These quantitative data may be a valuable reference for the assessment of normal fetal eyeball development in clinical settings and may be considered a supplement to anatomical investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2949533725,"Regenerated cartilage formed after Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation may be of suboptimal quality due to postulated hypertrophic changes. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide, containing the parathyroid hormone sequence (PTHrP 1–34), enhances cartilage growth during development and inhibits hypertrophic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and growth plate chondrocytes. This study aims to determine the possible anabolic and/or hypertrophic effect of PTH on human articular chondrocytes. Healthy human articular cartilage-derived chondrocytes (n = 6 donors) were cultured on type II collagen-coated transwells with/without 0.1 or 1.0 μM PTH from day 0, 9, or 21 until the end of culture (day 28). Extracellular matrix production, (pre)hypertrophy and PTH signaling were assessed by RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry for collagen type I, II, X, RUNX2, MMP13, PTHR1 and IHH and by determining glycosaminoglycan production and DNA content. The Bern score assessed cartilage quality by histology. Regardless of the concentration and initiation of supplementation, PTH treatment significantly decreased DNA and glycosaminoglycan content and reduced the Bern score compared with controls. Type I collagen deposition was increased, whereas PTHR1 expression and type II collagen deposition were decreased by PTH supplementation. Expression of the (pre)hypertrophic markers MMP13, RUNX2, IHH and type X collagen were not affected by PTH. In conclusion, PTH supplementation to healthy human articular chondrocytes did not affect hypertrophic differentiation, but negatively influenced cartilage quality, the tissues’ extracellular matrix and cell content. Although PTH may be an effective inhibitor of hypertrophic differentiation in MSC-based cartilage repair, care may be warranted in applying accessory PTH treatment due to its effects on articular chondrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2934336657,"Administration of sclerostin-neutralizing antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment has been shown to elicit an anabolic bone response in growing and adult mice. Prior work characterized the response of individual mouse strains but did not establish whether the impact of Scl-Ab on whole bone strength would vary across different inbred mouse strains. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that two inbred mouse strains (A/J and C57BL/6J (B6)) will show different whole bone strength outcomes following sclerostin-neutralizing antibody (Scl-Ab) treatment during growth (4.5-8.5 weeks of age). Treated B6 femurs showed a significantly greater stiffness (S) (68.8% vs. 46.0%) and maximum load (ML) (84.7% vs. 44.8%) compared to A/J. Although treated A/J and B6 femurs showed greater cortical area (Ct.Ar) similarly relative to their controls (37.7% in A/J and 41.1% in B6), the location of new bone deposition responsible for the greater mass differed between strains and may explain the greater whole bone strength observed in treated B6 mice. A/J femurs showed periosteal expansion and endocortical infilling, while B6 femurs showed periosteal expansion. Post-yield displacement (PYD) was smaller in treated A/J femurs (-61.2%, p < 0.001) resulting in greater brittleness compared to controls; an effect not present in B6 mice. Inter-strain differences in S, ML, and PYD led to divergent changes in work-to-fracture (Work). Work was 27.2% (p = 0.366) lower in treated A/J mice and 66.2% (p < 0.001) greater in treated B6 mice relative to controls. Our data confirmed the anabolic response to Scl-Ab shown by others, and provided evidence suggesting the mechanical benefits of Scl-Ab administration may be modulated by genetic background, with intrinsic growth patterns of these mice guiding the location of new bone deposition. Whether these differential outcomes will persist in adult and elderly mice remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2932053488,"Recent studies showed that physical and/or neuropsychiatric impairments significantly affect long-term mortality of ICU survivors. We conducted this study to investigate that simplified measurement of physical function and level of consciousness at hospital discharge by attending nurses could predict long-term outcomes after hospital discharge. A retrospective analysis of prospectively and retrospectively collected data of 246 patients who received medical ICU treatment was conducted. We grouped patients according to physical function and level of consciousness measured by the simplified method at hospital discharge as follow; group A included patients with alert mental and capable of walking or moving by wheel chairs; group B included those with alert mental and bed-ridden status; and Group C included those with confused mental and bed-ridden status. The two-year survival rate after hospital discharge was compared. Of 246 patients, 157 patients were included in the analysis and there were 103 survivors after two-year follow up. Compared to non-survivors, survivors were more likely to be younger (P = 0.026) and have higher body mass index (P = 0.019) and no malignant disease (P = 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in treatment modalities including medication, use of medical devices, and physical therapy between the survivors and non-survivors. The analysis showed significant differences in survival between the groups classified by physical function (P < 0.001) and level of consciousness (P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that survival rate was significantly lower among the patients in group C than in those in group B or group A (P < 0.001). Simplified method to assess physical function and level of consciousness at hospital discharge can predict long-term outcomes of medical ICU survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2932245888,"Experimental non-human primate models of obesity are induced through the introduction of atypically calorically rich diets. Studies in captive-bred macaques show the development of obesity and diabetes with similar complications to humans including eye and kidney diseases, nerve damage associated with pain and blood vessel damage. Diets differ in outcomes and here we document inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can be exacerbated through these dietary interventions. Following baseline physiological evaluation of body composition, Southern pigtail macaques were given a high-fat diet (HFD) for three months. This HFD consisted of lard, grains (including gluten), dairy and fructose that was otherwise omitted from a standard macaque diet (Chow). Physiological parameters were then reassessed before animals were reverted back to standard Chow for a further three months (remission). Consumption of the HFD resulted in food-mediated hypersensitivity marked by chronic weight loss, alopecia, malabsorption, protein-losing enteropathy and gross diffuse intestinal villi atrophy and lamina propria hypertrophy. Physiological changes were more highly pronounced in female macaques suggesting sex-specific differences but could be fully reversed through change of diet. Care should be taken in choosing non-human primate HFD diets for creating experimental models of obesity because they can induce severe food-driven chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that can eventuate to diet-induced chronic wasting and mortality."
