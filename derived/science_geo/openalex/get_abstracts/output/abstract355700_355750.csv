https://openalex.org/W2168969893,"Changes in redox status have been observed during immune responses in different organisms, but the associated signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. In plants, these redox changes regulate the conformation of NPR1, a master regulator of salicylic acid (SA)–mediated defense genes. NPR1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm as an oligomer through intermolecular disulfide bonds. We report that S-nitrosylation of NPR1 by S- nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) at cysteine-156 facilitates its oligomerization, which maintains protein homeostasis upon SA induction. Conversely, the SA-induced NPR1 oligomer-to-monomer reaction is catalyzed by thioredoxins (TRXs). Mutations in both NPR1 cysteine-156 and TRX compromised NPR1-mediated disease resistance. Thus, the regulation of NPR1 is through the opposing action of GSNO and TRX. These findings suggest a link between pathogen-triggered redox changes and gene regulation in plant immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2148585617,"Earth's surface chemical environment has evolved from an early anoxic condition to the oxic state we have today. Transitional between an earlier Proterozoic world with widespread deep-water anoxia and a Phanerozoic world with large oxygen-utilizing animals, the Neoproterozoic Era [1000 to 542 million years ago (Ma)] plays a key role in this history. The details of Neoproterozoic Earth surface oxygenation, however, remain unclear. We report that through much of the later Neoproterozoic (&lt;742 ± 6 Ma), anoxia remained widespread beneath the mixed layer of the oceans; deeper water masses were sometimes sulfidic but were mainly Fe 2+ -enriched. These ferruginous conditions marked a return to ocean chemistry not seen for more than one billion years of Earth history."
https://openalex.org/W2041314908,"Observing the individual building blocks of matter is one of the primary goals of microscopy. The invention of the scanning tunnelling microscope revolutionized experimental surface science in that atomic-scale features on a solid-state surface could finally be readily imaged. However, scanning tunnelling microscopy has limited applicability due to restrictions in, for example, sample conductivity, cleanliness, and data acquisition rate. An older microscopy technique, that of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), has benefited tremendously in recent years from subtle instrumentation advances, and individual heavy (high-atomic-number) atoms can now be detected by TEM even when embedded within a semiconductor material. But detecting an individual low-atomic-number atom, for example carbon or even hydrogen, is still extremely challenging, if not impossible, via conventional TEM owing to the very low contrast of light elements. Here we demonstrate a means to observe, by conventional TEM, even the smallest atoms and molecules: on a clean single-layer graphene membrane, adsorbates such as atomic hydrogen and carbon can be seen as if they were suspended in free space. We directly image such individual adatoms, along with carbon chains and vacancies, and investigate their dynamics in real time. These techniques open a way to reveal dynamics of more complex chemical reactions or identify the atomic-scale structure of unknown adsorbates. In addition, the study of atomic-scale defects in graphene may provide insights for nanoelectronic applications of this interesting material."
https://openalex.org/W2046762508,"In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), light–matter interactions between a single emitter (an atom or an atom-like system with discrete energy levels) and a resonant optical cavity are investigated at a fundamental level. Recent advances in solid-state implementations, which offer great design flexibility, have given this field considerable momentum. An outstanding important question has been which features in such a system show true quantum behaviour and cannot be explained with classical models. Hofheinz et al. study a 'circuit' QED system where a superconducting qubit acts as an atom-like two-energy level system and is embedded in a microwave transmission circuit, acting as the optical cavity. They demonstrate in this system the creation of pure quantum states, known as Fock states, which give specific numbers of energy quanta, in this case photons. Fock states with up to six photons are prepared and analysed. The results are important because cavity QED is expected to play a crucial role in the development of quantum information processing and communication applications. A 'circuit' quantum electrodynamics system where a superconducting qubit acts as an atom-like two-energy level system and is embedded in a microwave transmission circuit (acting as the optical cavity) is studied. In this system, it is demonstrated that the creation of pure quantum states, known as Fock states, which give specific numbers of energy quanta, in this case photons. Fock states with up to six photons are prepared and analysed. Spin systems and harmonic oscillators comprise two archetypes in quantum mechanics1. The spin-1/2 system, with two quantum energy levels, is essentially the most nonlinear system found in nature, whereas the harmonic oscillator represents the most linear, with an infinite number of evenly spaced quantum levels. A significant difference between these systems is that a two-level spin can be prepared in an arbitrary quantum state using classical excitations, whereas classical excitations applied to an oscillator generate a coherent state, nearly indistinguishable from a classical state2. Quantum behaviour in an oscillator is most obvious in Fock states, which are states with specific numbers of energy quanta, but such states are hard to create3,4,5,6,7. Here we demonstrate the controlled generation of multi-photon Fock states in a solid-state system. We use a superconducting phase qubit8, which is a close approximation to a two-level spin system, coupled to a microwave resonator, which acts as a harmonic oscillator, to prepare and analyse pure Fock states with up to six photons. We contrast the Fock states with coherent states generated using classical pulses applied directly to the resonator."
https://openalex.org/W2049271022,"The field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), traditionally studied in atomic systems1,2,3, has gained new momentum by recent reports of quantum optical experiments with solid-state semiconducting4,5,6,7,8 and superconducting9,10,11 systems. In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode splitting is used to investigate the nature of matter–light interaction at a quantum-mechanical level. However, this effect can, at least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of two coupled linear oscillators12. It has been suggested that an observation of the scaling of the resonant atom–photon coupling strength in the Jaynes–Cummings energy ladder13 with the square root of photon number n is sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature14. Here we report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system, our measurements provide unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the quantum nature of the resonant atom–field interaction in cavity QED. We explore atom–photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in a circuit QED set-up15, in which very strong coupling is realized by the large dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit embedded in a high-quality on-chip microwave cavity. Circuit QED systems also provide a natural quantum interface between flying qubits (photons) and stationary qubits for applications in quantum information processing and communication16."
https://openalex.org/W2162056177,"Attention exerts a strong influence over neuronal processing in cortical areas. It selectively increases firing rates and affects tuning properties, including changing receptive field locations and sizes. Although these effects are well studied, their cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular mechanisms, we combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis of cholinergic receptors with single cell recordings in V1 while rhesus macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a task that demanded top-down spatial attention. Attending to the receptive field of the V1 neuron under study caused an increase in firing rates. Here we show that this attentional modulation was enhanced by low doses of acetylcholine. Furthermore, applying the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation, whereas the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine had no systematic effect. These results demonstrate that muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play a central part in mediating the effects of attention in V1."

https://openalex.org/W1972312016,"In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Start checkpoint integrates multiple internal and external signals into an all-or-none decision to enter the cell cycle. Here we show that Start behaves like a switch due to systems-level feedback in the regulatory network. In contrast to current models proposing a linear cascade of Start activation, transcriptional positive feedback of the G1 cyclins Cln1 and Cln2 induces the near-simultaneous expression of the approximately 200-gene G1/S regulon. Nuclear Cln2 drives coherent regulon expression, whereas cytoplasmic Cln2 drives efficient budding. Cells with the CLN1 and CLN2 genes deleted frequently arrest as unbudded cells, incurring a large fluctuation-induced fitness penalty due to both the lack of cytoplasmic Cln2 and insufficient G1/S regulon expression. Thus, positive-feedback-amplified expression of Cln1 and Cln2 simultaneously drives robust budding and rapid, coherent regulon expression. A similar G1/S regulatory network in mammalian cells, comprised of non-orthologous genes, suggests either conservation of regulatory architecture or convergent evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2050347178,"Partial agonists are ligands that bind to receptors but produce only a small maximum response even at concentrations where all receptors are occupied. In the case of ligand-activated ion channels, it has been supposed since 1957 that partial agonists evoke a small response because they are inefficient at eliciting the change of conformation between shut and open states of the channel. We have investigated partial agonists for two members of the nicotinic superfamily-the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the glycine receptor-and find that the open-shut reaction is similar for both full and partial agonists, but the response to partial agonists is limited by an earlier conformation change ('flipping') that takes place while the channel is still shut. This has implications for the interpretation of structural studies, and in the future, for the design of partial agonists for therapeutic use."
https://openalex.org/W1980346622,"Little is known about the origin of the magnetic fields in today's galaxies because of the difficulty of detecting magnetism in the distant Universe. An indirect observation technique can help. A study of a sample of quasars with strong Mg ii absorption lines shows that they are associated with larger Faraday rotation measures, indicative of high-strength magnetic fields. Mg ii absorption is a characteristic of the haloes of normal galaxies, seen in projection in front of background polarized quasars. These observations suggest that completely normal galaxies contained magnetic fields, with strengths comparable to those seen today, when the Universe was only about a third of its present age. The origin and growth of magnetic fields in galaxies is still something of an enigma. Quasars with strong MgII absorption lines are unambiguously associated with larger rotation measures, which requires that organized fields of surprisingly high strength are associated with normal galaxies when the Universe was only about half its present age. The origin and growth of magnetic fields in galaxies is still something of an enigma1. It is generally assumed that seed fields are amplified over time through the dynamo effect2,3,4,5, but there are few constraints on the timescale. It was recently demonstrated that field strengths as traced by rotation measures of distant (and hence ancient) quasars are comparable to those seen today6, but it was unclear whether the high fields were in the unusual environments of the quasars themselves or distributed along the lines of sight. Here we report high-resolution spectra that demonstrate that the quasars with strong Mg ii absorption lines are unambiguously associated with larger rotation measures. Because Mg ii absorption occurs in the haloes of normal galaxies7,8,9,10,11 along the sightlines to the quasars, this association requires that organized fields of surprisingly high strengths are associated with normal galaxies when the Universe was only about one-third of its present age."
https://openalex.org/W2050437677,"Cytokine signaling is thought to require assembly of multicomponent signaling complexes at cytoplasmic segments of membrane-embedded receptors, in which receptor-proximal protein kinases are activated. Indeed, CD40, a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member, forms a complex containing adaptor molecules TRAF2 and TRAF3, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP1/2), IκB kinase regulatory subunit IKKγ (also called NEMO), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase MEKK1 upon ligation. TRAF2, Ubc13, and IKKγ were required for complex assembly and activation of MEKK1 and MAPK cascades. However, these kinases were not activated unless the multicomponent signaling complex translocated from CD40 to the cytosol upon c-IAP1/2–induced degradation of TRAF3. This two-stage signaling mechanism may apply to other innate immune receptors, accounting for spatial and temporal separation of MAPK and IKK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2090373595,"Reduced activity of CLK-1/MCLK1 (also known as COQ7), a mitochondrial enzyme that is necessary for ubiquinone biosynthesis, prolongs the lifespan of nematodes and mice by a mechanism that is distinct from that of the insulin signaling pathway. Here we show that 2-fold reduction of MCLK1 expression in mice reveals an additional function for the protein, as this level of reduction does not affect ubiquinone levels yet affects mitochondrial function substantially. Indeed, we observe that the phenotype of young Mclk1+/- mutants includes a severe reduction of mitochondrial electron transport, ATP synthesis, and total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADtot) pool size as well as an alteration in the activity of key enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Surprisingly, we also find that Mclk1 heterozygosity leads to a dramatic increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress by a variety of measures. Furthermore, we find that the mitochondrial dysfunction is accompanied by a decrease in oxidative damage to cytosolic proteins as well as by a decrease in plasma isoprostanes, a systemic biomarker of oxidative stress and aging. We propose a mechanism for the conjunction of low ATP levels, high mitochondrial oxidative stress, and low non-mitochondrial oxidative damage in a long-lived mutant. Our model helps to clarify the relationship between energy metabolism and the aging process and suggests the need for a reformulation of the mitochondrial oxidative stress theory of aging.

Genetic evidence in nematodes indicates that the mechanism by which clk-1 prolongs lifespan is distinct from that of the insulin signaling pathway but overlaps with that of caloric restriction (3Lakowski B.

CLK-1/MCLK1 is a mitochondrial hydroxylase that is necessary for the biosynthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q or UQ), a membrane antioxidant, lipid soluble enzymatic cofactor, and essential electron transporter of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (8Levavasseur F.

In the absence of CLK-1/MCLK1, both worms and cultured mouse ES cells accumulate the biosynthetic intermediate demethoxyubiquinone (DMQ). 2The abbreviations used are: DMQdemethoxyubiquinoneTCAtricarboxylic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTMPDN,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineROSreactive oxygen species. 2The abbreviations used are: DMQdemethoxyubiquinoneTCAtricarboxylic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyTMPDN,N,N′N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamineROSreactive oxygen species. Furthermore, no UQ can be detected in Mclk1-/- embryos, which start to die after embryonic day 8 (8Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In contrast, clk-1 mutant worms, although they are equally unable to manufacture UQ9, survive thanks to their ability to absorb dietary (bacterial) UQ8 (endogenous UQ9 and bacterial UQ8 have different isoprenoid side chain lengths, as indicated by the subscript). These mutants, therefore, contain a mix of exogenous UQ8 and endogenous DMQ9. In such animals, Kayser et al. (10Kayser E.B. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Hoppel C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54479-54486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) discovered a reduction in electron transport from mitochondrial complex I but not from complex II, an observation that was interpreted as a difference in the way these complexes interact with the quinone pool. In contrast, in Mclk1-/- mouse ES cells, which contain DMQ9 but no detectable level of exogenous UQ, only electron transport from complex II is impaired (8Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J.

Molecular and genetic analysis of different alleles of C. elegans clk-1 has previously suggested that CLK-1 might have other roles in mitochondrial function in addition to that of a DMQ hydroxylase. In particular, it was found that both the phenotypically severe allele clk-1(qm30), a partial deletion that does not produce any CLK-1 protein, and the phenotypically weaker allele clk-1(e2519), a Glu to Lys missense mutation that produces wild-type levels of a full-length mutant protein (11Hihi A.K. Kebir H. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41013-41018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), are equally unable to sustain UQ biosynthesis (12Jonassen T. Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, suppression of clk-1(e2519) by a tRNA missense suppressor produces only very small amounts of UQ9 but results in full phenotypic suppression (13Branicky R. Nguyen P.A. Hekimi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Together these observations suggest that at least part of the phenotype of clk-1 mutants is not because of the defect in UQ biosynthesis. Previous analysis of Mclk1+/- mutants revealed that the level of MCLK1 protein was reduced ∼2-fold in these animals and that their lifespan was increased up to 30% compared with that of their Mclk1+/+ siblings in three distinct genetic backgrounds (2Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). It was also discovered that in the livers of very old Mclk1+/- mutants, analyzed shortly before natural death, there are areas of complete loss of expression of Mclk1, both mRNA and protein, through a phenomenon of loss-of-heterozygosity (2Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We and others (14Aguilaniu H. Durieux J. Dillin A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2399-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have speculated that the presence of these Mclk1-/- clones might be responsible for the longevity of Mclk1+/- mutants. However, because Mclk1-/- clones have been found exclusively in very old animals, the notion of their importance for the extended lifespan of these animals implies that the extension is the result of a protective effect that takes place in old animals only and not the result of a reduction of the rate of aging throughout life. In the present study we have tested various aspects of the phenotype of young Mclk1+/- mutants, with particular attention to mitochondria, to better understand the basis of the increased longevity of these animals. We demonstrate that the reduction of MCLK1 levels in young Mclk1+/- animals does not affect UQ levels yet profoundly alters the functions of the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle while increasing mitochondrial oxidative stress. Additionally, we show that this early mitochondrial dysfunction leads to a reduction in the levels of cytosolic oxidative damage to proteins (protein carbonyls) as well as in a reduction in the levels of a systemic biomarker of aging (plasma isoprostanes), thus suggesting that the anti-aging effect triggered by low MCLK1 levels already occurs at a young age. These results provide a genetic model that will help to clarify the links between mitochondrial function and aging. Animals—All the animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility at McGill University and were given a standard rodent diet and water ad libitum. Mice, 3-month-old Balb/c males, were anesthetized, sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and perfused with phosphate buffer. Tissues were then rapidly removed, rinsed, and placed in ice-cold mitochondrial isolation buffer or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All procedures were approved by the McGill Animal Care and Ethics committees. Identification of Quinones—The extraction of quinones as well as their quantification by HPLC were performed as we previously described (2Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The total amount of quinone was normalized to the amount of protein. Mitochondrial Oxygen Consumption and ATP Production—Unless otherwise stated, all the chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. On the day of the experiment, fresh tissues were homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of the indicated homogenization buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA (for liver and kidney); 100 mm sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 46 mm KCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (for muscle); 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.04 mm BSA (for heart); 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA (for brain). Mitochondria were isolated by standard differential centrifugation according to detailed procedures described else-where (15Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Starkov A.A. Fiskum G. Chinopoulos C. Lorenzo B.J. Browne S.E. Patel M.S. Beal M.F. J.

The purity of the mitochondrial and cytosolic preparations obtained by following the published methods were checked by classic Western blotting experiments with antisera against mitochondrial porin (Calbiochem) and cytosolic α-tubulin. No porin and no α-tubulin could be detected in the cytosolic and the mitochondrial fractions respectively (Fig. 2A). Oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria was measured polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode connected to a suitable recorder (Yellow Springs instruments) in a 1.75-ml thermostatted water-jacketed closed chamber with magnetic stirring at 30 °C according to Schuh et al. (19Schuh R.A. Kristian T. Gupta R.K. Flaws J.A. Fiskum G. Toxicol. Sci. 2005; 88: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the respiratory reaction medium consisted of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, and 2 mm MgCl2. Mitochondria were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg protein/ml with external electron donor substrates consisting of either 5 mm glutamate or pyruvate (with 1 mm malate), 5 mm succinate (with 1 μm rotenone), or 0.15 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD, with 2.5 mm ascorbate and 1 μm antimycin). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of substrates and ADP (0.8 mm) is reported as state 3, whereas the state corresponding to the period after all added ADP has been converted into ATP is defined as State 4 respiration. State 4 respiration was also measured in the presence of 1.25 mg/ml oligomycin to eliminate the contribution of ATP cycling enzymes. The respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4) of control animals was ∼7.5 with glutamate/malate and ∼4 with succinate plus rotenone, indicating intactness of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We also evaluated the coupling between ADP phosphorylation and oxygen consumption by calculating the adenosine diphosphate-to-oxygen ratio (ADP/O) from the trace graph (Fig. 2B), and the resulting data, ∼3.2 for glutamate/malate and ∼2 for succinate + rotenone, indicated that the control mitochondria were well coupled. The fully uncoupled rate of oxygen consumption was also measured after the addition of 1 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and no difference was observed between control and heterozygous animals (not shown). The quality of mitochondria preparation was confirmed by at least a 3-fold increase in respiration rate in the presence of the uncoupler. The quantification of ATP synthesis by isolated mitochondria was performed according to the method previously described by Drew and Leeuwenburgh (20Drew B. Leeuwenburgh C. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2003; 285: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and using the ATP determination kit (Invitrogen) for quantitatively measuring ATP production. After the initial luminescence reading, ADP (200 μm) was added to the respiratory reaction medium containing freshly isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml), and the increase in luminescence was monitored for 2 min at 30-s intervals on an infinite M200 plate reader (Tecan). Quantitative Determination of Mitochondrial and Tissue ATP, ADP, and Total NAD Levels—Mitochondrial and tissue adenine nucleotides (ADP and ATP) levels were determined using an ATP determination kit (Invitrogen) as described else-where (21Sone H. Sasaki Y. Komai M. Toyomizu M. Kagawa Y. Furukawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 314: 824-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Total nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, NADH) levels were determined using the NAD+/NADH quantification kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Standard curves generated with known amounts of purified ATP and NADH were used to calculate mitochondrial and tissue concentrations. Electron Transport Chain Assays—Mitochondrial samples were diluted with 30 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, to reach a concentration of about 1 mg/ml protein concentration and then subjected to three rounds of freezing-thawing. Activities of the respiratory chain enzymes and levels of electron transport were measured at 30 °C using a Beckman DU 640 spectro-photometer as described (22Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). All reactions were initiated by the addition of mitochondrial proteins, complex I (10 μg), complex II (15 μg), complex III (10 μg), complex IV (5 μg), complex I-II (5 μg), and complex II-III (5 μg). For complex II activity, activity was measured by following the decrease in absorbance due to the coupled reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol at 600 with 750 nm as the reference wavelength. The reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 20 mm succinate, and 5 mm MgCl2 was preincubated with 15 μg of mitochondrial protein at 30 °C. After 10 min of incubation, antimycin (2 μg), rotenone (2 μg), KCN (2 mm), and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (150 μm) were added. 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol can accept electrons from the complex II (23Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the complex II-bound ubiquinone, or exogenous ubiquinone. Thus, the activity was first monitored for 1 min without the addition of exogenous ubiquinone. Subsequently, complex II activity was also measured with the addition of ubiquinone (Q1) (100 μm) and was monitored for 2 min. No difference was observed between both genotypes with the addition of exogenous Q1 to the reaction. Assay of TCA Cycle Enzymes—Activities of TCA cycle enzymes (citrate synthase, aconitase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase) in mitochondrial preparations were measured as previously described (24Nulton-Persson A.C. Szweda L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23357-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). H2O2 Production—Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production from isolated liver mitochondria was measured fluorimetrically utilizing the Amplex Red™-horseradish peroxidase method (Invitrogen) as previously described (25Muller F.L. Liu Y. Van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the reaction medium contained 125 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 20 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 1 μm Amplex Red. After mitochondrial addition, the oxidizable substrate consisting of 5 mm glutamate plus malate was added. Adenosine diphosphate (0.8 mm) was added a minute later followed by oligomycin (1.25 μg/ml). Detection of H2O2 production was measured as an increase in fluorescence of Amplex Red dye at 590 nm with the excitation wavelength set at 545 nm. The dye response was calibrated with the addition of known amounts of H2O2. Enzymatic Antioxidant Assays—Mitochondrial and cytosolic Se-GPx activities were determined by the standard indirect method of NADPH oxidation using t-butyl hydroperoxide (26Flohe L. Gunzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Manganese-dependent and CuZn-superoxide dismutase activities were assessed using a commercially available kit (Cayman Chemical). ROS Damage—Lipid peroxidation was determined by the indirect measurement of free aldehydes, malondialdehydes plus 4-hydroxyalkenals such as 4-hydroxy-2(E) nonenal, using a commercially available kit (LPO-586, OxisResearch). The level of protein carbonyl in liver tissues was determined with the Protein Carbonyl Assay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasma free and esterified 8-isoprostanes were quantified with an 8-isoprostanes enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical) according to the provided protocol. The plasma levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, a biomarker for oxidative damage to DNA, were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stressgen). Statistical Analysis—Analyses were performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test, and differences between the two genotypes (10-12 Mclk1+/+ and Mclk1+/- animals unless otherwise stated in the figure legends) were considered to be significant when p was <0.05. Reduction in Mitochondrial Electron Transport between Mitochondrial Complexes Despite Normal Levels of Ubiquinone—We have shown previously that Mclk1+/- tissues exhibit the expected 2-fold decrease in Mclk1 mRNA and MCLK1 protein levels but that UQ9 levels were unaffected in tissue homogenates from such mice (2Liu X. Jiang N. Hughes B. Bigras E. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2424-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 8Levavasseur F. Miyadera H. Sirois J. Tremblay M.L. Kita K. Shoubridge E. Hekimi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46160-46164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We have now extended these studies to mitochondrial extracts, which we also find to display no reduction in either UQ9 or UQ10 levels in either of the liver, kidney, or brain of the very animals used in the various studies described below (Fig. 1). This suggests that Mclk1 is in fact fully recessive for its function in UQ biosynthesis. However, as we have found that the heterozygous mice have an extended lifespan, and for other reasons out-lined in the introduction, there are grounds to believe that CLK-1/MCLK1 could also have an additional activity unrelated to UQ biosynthesis (13Branicky R. Nguyen P.A. Hekimi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3976-3985Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) but responsible for the phenotypes observed in Mclk1+/- heterozygous mutants. As MCLK1 is a mitochondrial protein, we tested various aspects of mitochondrial function in young (3 months old) Balb/c Mclk1+/- males in five representative organs. We found that in liver (Fig. 2, B and C) and kidney (Fig. 2D), the rate of electron transport measured by oxygen consumption from intact isolated mitochondria is reduced with both complex I substrates (glutamate in combination with malate) and a complex II substrate (succinate) as well as with an artificial substrate (TMPD plus ascorbate) that donates electrons directly to cytochrome c and, thus, measures electron transport from cytochrome c to complex IV (27Crinson M. Nicholls P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with Mclk1+/- males from the C57BL/6J and the 129SV/j X Balb/c genetic backgrounds (data not shown). We also tested electron transport between pairs of complexes (complex I to III and complex II to III) and found decreases in electron transport of a similar magnitude as for overall electron transport measured by oxygen consumption (Table 1; Fig. 2H). In addition, we tested oxygen consumption with glutamate in skeletal muscle and heart (Fig. 2, F and G). A clear decrease of oxygen consumption was observed in skeletal muscle similar to that seen in liver and kidney, and a similar trend was also observed in heart mitochondria. The reduction in electron transport in Mclk1+/- mutants in the absence of any reduction in UQ levels in these animals indicates that partial loss of MCLK1 affects electron transport independently of the function of the protein in UQ biosynthesis. This conclusion is also consistent with the finding of a reduction of electron transport from cytochrome c to complex IV, a step that does not require UQ.TABLE 1Mitochondrial electron transport chain and TCA cycle-related measurementsLiverKidneyBrainMclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−Mclk1+/+Mclk1+/−nmol/mg/minnmol/mg/minnmol/mg/minElectron transport chain assaysC IaC I-IV, mitochondrial complexes; C I-III and C II-III, electron transport between complexes; Citrate S., citrate synthase; αKGDH, α-ketoglutrate dehydrogenase; Iso.

Open table in a new tab Using specific electron donors and acceptors we also tested the activities of complexes I through IV individually (Table 1 and Fig. 2H). In liver and kidney the activity of all complexes appeared essentially intact in the Mclk1+/- mutants. Only complex II is affected in Mclk1+/- mice but only when no soluble UQ1 is provided as a mediator to enhance electron transport to the oxidized acceptor (see“Experimental Procedures”). This suggests that there is a very mild defect in the mutant complex that can only be revealed under conditions in which electron transport by the complex cannot be efficient. Interestingly, the defects in mitochondrial function that we describe were not observed in the brain (Fig. 2E). Brain mitochondrial function is known to be quite different from that of non-nervous tissue as is also apparent from our measurements of the wild type (Table 1). Further experiments will be necessary to determine why brain mitochondria are immune to a partial loss of MCLK1 function. Reduction in the Rate of Mitochondrial ATP Synthesis, in Cellular ATP, and in Total Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Levels—The main function of mitochondrial electron transport is ATP production. We, therefore, determined the rate of ATP synthesis from liver mitochondria (Fig. 3A). We observed a marked decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis that correlated strongly with the rate of oxygen consumption in preparations from individual animals (Fig. 3B). We also measured ATP levels in the freshly isolated mitochondria at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 3C) and observed a reduction in these levels. This suggests that ATP synthesis is reduced in vivo; that is, even when the mitochondria are not provided with saturating amounts of substrate, ADP, and oxygen, as is the case in vitro. We confirmed this observation by measuring ATP levels in samples of snap-frozen livers, kidneys, and hearts and observed strikingly lower ATP levels in all three organs (Fig. 3D). This decrease in ATP levels results in a lower ATP/ADP ratio in liver (Fig. 3E). Of note, the difference in absolute ATP levels between tissues and isolated mitochondria is likely attributable to a lost of ATP content that is known to occur during the isolation procedure (28Austin J. Aprille J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 154-160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One crucial ATP-dependent cellular process that impinges on energy metabolism and many other processes is the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (including NAD+ and NADH). We, therefore, determined the total NAD level in frozen liver and found it to be significantly lower in heterozygous mice (Fig. 3F). Thus, the altered mitochondrial function of Mclk1+/- likely affects the rate of a variety of energy-dependent cellular processes by reducing in vivo ATP levels as well as total NAD levels. Altered Activities of the TCA Cycle Enzymes Aconitase and α-Ketoglutarate Dehydrogenase—Next, we tested the activities of the main enzymes of the TCA cycle in the Mclk1+/- mutants (Table 1 and Fig. 4F) and found that the activity of aconitase was severely reduced, whereas that of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme regulating the metabolic flux through the cycle, was increased. The other enzymes that were analyzed were unaffected. It is well known that aconitase is particularly susceptible to reaction with superoxide (29Gardner P.R. Raineri I. Epstein L.B. White C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13399-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and we believe that the reduction of aconitase is in fact because of an increase of oxidative stress in the mitochondria (see below). Interestingly, it has been predicted that in a situation in which aconitase is depleted due to oxidative stress the TCA cycle might function differently"
https://openalex.org/W2005186288,"Many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are thought to be caused by protein misfolding. The polyQ diseases, including Huntington disease and spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), are caused by abnormal expansions of the polyQ stretch in disease-causing proteins, which trigger misfolding of these proteins, resulting in their deposition as inclusion bodies in affected neurons. Although genetic expression of molecular chaperones has been shown to suppress polyQ protein misfolding and neurodegeneration, toward developing a therapy, it is ideal to induce endogenous molecular chaperones by chemical administration. In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effects of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)-activating compounds, which induce multiple molecular chaperones, on polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. We found that oral administration of 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) markedly suppresses compound eye degeneration and inclusion body formation in a Drosophila model of SCA. 17-AAG also dramatically rescued the lethality of the SCA model (74.1% rescue) and suppressed neurodegeneration in a Huntington disease model (46.3% rescue), indicating that 17-AAG is widely effective against various polyQ diseases. 17-AAG induced Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp90 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and the expression levels correlated with its therapeutic effects. Furthermore, knockdown of HSF1 abolished the induction of molecular chaperones and the therapeutic effect of 17-AAG, indicating that its therapeutic effects depend on HSF1 activation. Our study indicates that induction of multiple molecular chaperones by 17-AAG treatment is a promising therapeutic approach for a wide range of polyQ diseases and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.

The accumulation and deposition of misfolded proteins in the brain has been recognized as a common molecular pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the polyglutamine (polyQ) 4The abbreviations used are: polyQpolyglutamineSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaHSF1heat shock transcription factor 117-AAG17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycinGAgeldanamycinRAradicicolCLcelastrolSBsodium butyrateGGAgeranylgeranylacetoneHAhemagglutininSL2Schneider line 2HRPhorseradish peroxidaseRTreverse transcriptionRNAiRNA interference. 4The abbreviations used are: polyQpolyglutamineSCAspinocerebellar ataxiaHSF1heat shock transcription factor 117-AAG17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycinGAgeldanamycinRAradicicolCLcelastrolSBsodium butyrateGGAgeranylgeranylacetoneHAhemagglutininSL2Schneider line 2HRPhorseradish peroxidaseRTreverse transcriptionRNAiRNA interference. diseases, and hence these diseases are called protein misfolding diseases (1Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Indeed, most genetic mutations responsible for these diseases produce mutant proteins that are prone to be misfolded. These facts strongly indicate that protein misfolding commonly occurs as the initial step in the pathogenic cascade of neurodegenerative diseases, and hence protein misfolding is considered to be a common therapeutic target for these neurodegenerative diseases. polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxia heat shock transcription factor 1 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin geldanamycin radicicol celastrol sodium butyrate geranylgeranylacetone hemagglutinin Schneider line 2 horseradish peroxidase reverse transcription RNA interference. polyglutamine spinocerebellar ataxia heat shock transcription factor 1 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin geldanamycin radicicol celastrol sodium butyrate geranylgeranylacetone hemagglutinin Schneider line 2 horseradish peroxidase reverse transcription RNA interference. The polyQ diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington disease, various types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA1, 2, 6, 7, and 17 and SCA3/MJD), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy, all of which are caused by expansions of the polyQ stretch to greater than 35-40 repeats in each disease-causing protein (2Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). These expanded polyQ stretches cause misfolding of the disease-causing proteins, leading to their pathogenic interactions with themselves (aggregation) or other cellular proteins, resulting in their deposition and recruitment as inclusion bodies in affected neurons (1Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The pathogenic interactions of misfolded polyQ proteins with other cellular proteins such as transcription factors, proteasome subunits, and cytoskeletal proteins have been reported to cause dysfunction of these proteins, eventually leading to neuronal dysfunction (4Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 5Nagai Y. Onodera O. Chun J. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. Exp.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6763-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Although therapeutic approaches against the dysfunction of each of these cellular proteins have been proposed to date, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors to improve transcriptional dysregulation (7Steffan J.S. Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazantsev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), their therapeutic effects were limited because polyQ-induced neuronal dysfunction results from the dysfunction of multiple cellular proteins (2Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, misfolding of the polyQ protein is likely the initial event in the pathogenic cascade, and hence suppression of protein misfolding is expected to inhibit a wide range of multiple downstream events, resulting in the most effective suppression of neuronal dysfunction. Molecular chaperones are known to suppress protein misfolding by synergistically assisting misfolded proteins in the refolding process, as well as newly synthesized proteins in the folding process. For example, Hsp70 has been reported to act in concert with Hsp40 to suppress misfolding of various polyQ proteins in vitro, resulting in suppression of their aggregation (8Kobayashi Y. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 9Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E.

In a Drosophila model of the polyQ diseases, co-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 has been reported to synergistically suppress misfolding of the polyQ protein, resulting in remarkable suppression of polyQ-induced neurodegeneration, although expression of Hsp70 or Hsp40 alone exhibits weaker suppression (10Chan H.Y.

Furthermore, genetic expression of Hsp70 or Hsp40 alone is known to cause cytotoxicity to unstressed cells, which is not observed when both chaperones are co-expressed (10Chan H.Y. Warrick J.M. Gray-Board G.L. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13Rørth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12418-12422Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), suggesting that the balance of the amounts of molecular chaperones is important for their proper function (14Muchowski P.J. Wacker J.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of other molecular chaperones such as Hsp90, Hsp105, and Hsp27 is also reported to suppress polyQ-induced cytotoxicity in cell culture models (15Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Saito Y. Adachi H. Kobayashi Y. Sobue G. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25143-25150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 16Mitsui K. Nakayama H.

Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Based on these results, expression of multiple molecular chaperones is expected to synergistically suppress polyQ-induced neurodegeneration and to have low cytotoxicity to unstressed cells. Expression of molecular chaperones upon exposure to various types of cellular stress is known to be regulated by heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1). Under unstressed conditions, HSF1 is localized in the cytosol and is inactivated in a protein complex including Hsp90 (18Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to stress, HSF1 dissociates from the Hsp90 protein complex, translocates into the nucleus, and binds to the heat shock element in the promoter region of various molecular chaperone genes to simultaneously induce their expression (19Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Activation of HSF1 is regulated through various post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, as well as alternative splicing (20Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 21Fujikake N. Nagai Y. Popiel H.A. Kano H. Yamaguchi M. Toda T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In fact, HSF1 is phosphorylated in response to heat shock stress in HeLa cells and induces multiple molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp40, which confer tolerance against heat shock stress on the cells (22Holmberg C.I. Illman S.A. Kallio M. Mikhailov A. Sistonen L. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Xia W. Vilaboa N. Martin J.L. Mestril R. Guo Y. Voellmy R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 8-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of a constitutively active mutant of HSF1, which lacks the regulatory domain that binds to the Hsp90 protein complex, has been reported to suppress polyQ protein misfolding through induction of molecular chaperones (24Fujimoto M. Takaki E. Hayashi T. Kitaura Y. Tanaka Y. Inouye S. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34908-34916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, HSF1 has been considered to be an attractive therapeutic target for the polyQ diseases. Although genetic expression of molecular chaperones and a constitutively active mutant of HSF1 ameliorates polyQ-induced phenotypes in vivo (11Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Benzer S. Science. 2000; 287: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 12Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34908-34916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), delivery of exogenous genes into the human brain is extremely limited. As a next step toward developing a therapy, it is ideal to pharmacologically induce endogenous molecular chaperones by administration of small chemical compounds, instead of to express exogenous genes. Interestingly, some compounds are known to activate HSF1 and to induce multiple endogenous molecular chaperones even under unstressed conditions (25Westerheide S.D. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33097-33100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These include Hsp90 inhibitors, which dissociate HSF1 from the Hsp90 protein complex, and protein kinase C activators, which promote the phosphorylation of HSF1, both leading to activation of HSF1 (18Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 26Yamanaka K. Takahashi N. Ooie T. Kaneda K. Yoshimatsu H.

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of administration of various HSF1-activating compounds on polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo. We here show that oral administration of 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), a derivative of geldanamycin, markedly suppresses polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila models of two polyQ diseases through induction of multiple molecular chaperones. Our study indicates the potential of HSF1-activating compounds as therapeutic candidates for a wide range of polyQ diseases as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.

The MJDtr-Q27 and MJDtr-Q78 fly lines express a truncated form of the MJD protein with the indicated number of glutamines (MJDtr-Q27 and MJDtr-Q78 proteins, respectively), and the Htt-Q128 fly line expresses an N-terminal fragment of the huntingtin protein with 128 glutamines (Htt-Q128 protein), under the control of the GAL4-UAS system. For the MJDtr-Q78 flies, the W line showing weak and the S line showing strong phenotypes were used (27Warrick J.M. Paulson H.L. Gray-Board G.L. Bui Q.T. Fischbeck K.H. Pittman R.N. Bonini N.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The chemical compounds to be tested were dissolved in ethanol, further diluted in water, and then mixed with Instant Drosophila medium (Carolina Biological Supply Company, Burlington, NC). 17-AAG was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA); geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol (RA) were from Sigma-Aldrich; celastrol (CL) was from Merck; and sodium butyrate (SB) was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Geranylgeranylacetone (GGA) supplemented with 0.2% α-tocopherol was kindly provided by Eisai Co. (Tokyo, Japan). These compounds were used for flies at the following concentrations: 17-AAG, GA, and RA (50 nm, 500 nm, 5 μm, and 50 μm); CL (1 μm, 10 μm, and 100 μm); SB (10 mm); and GGA (1 nm, 10 nm, 100 nm, and 40 mm). These compounds at the above concentrations did not affect the viability and fertility of the MJDtr-Q78 flies. For heat shock treatment, crawling third instar larvae were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and recovered at 25 °C for 1 h. Microscopy, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry—To evaluate the therapeutic effects of HSF1-activating compounds on compound eye degeneration in the MJDtr-Q78S flies, light microscopic images of the compound eye morphologies of 1-day-old adult flies were taken using a stereoscopic microscope model SZX9 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). To assess the therapeutic effects of HSF1-activating compounds on photoreceptor degeneration in the Htt-Q128 flies, heads of 1-day-old Htt-Q128 flies treated with 17-AAG, GA, or RA (5 μm) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde and embedded in Epon. Compound eyes were sectioned at 1 μm and stained with 0.5% toluidine blue. Microscopic images were taken using a fluorescence microscope model DMR (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with a CCD camera model DC500 (Leica Microsystems), and the average number of rhabdomeres/ommatidium was calculated. The percentage of rescue of photoreceptor degeneration was calculated by dividing the difference in the number of rhabdomeres between the 17-AAG-treated and untreated Htt-Q128 flies by the decrease in the number of rhabdomeres in the untreated Htt-Q128 flies. The number of rhabdomeres/ommatidium was counted in 20 ommatidia/fly, and at least 100 ommatidia were assessed for each condition except for SB treatment (60 ommatidia). The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. For immunohistochemical analysis, eye discs of the MJDtr-Q78W flies treated with 17-AAG (1.5 μm) were dissected from crawling third instar larvae and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The eye discs were immunostained with a rat monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) at 1:100 dilution as the primary antibody to detect the MJDtr-Q78 protein and Alexa 546-conjugated anti-rat IgG antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:2000 dilution as the secondary antibody. The images were taken using a confocal laser scanning microscope model LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The anteroposterior width of the eye disc area with cells containing inclusion bodies of the MJDtr-Q78 protein (Wi; see Fig. 5F) and that of the area with cells containing the diffusely distributed MJDtr-Q78 protein (Wd; see Fig. 5F) were measured using National Institutes of Health Image software. The ratio of Wi/Wd in each eye disc was calculated to evaluate the degree of inclusion body formation. At least seven discs were analyzed for each treatment condition. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Fly Survival Analyses—To examine the therapeutic effects of 17-AAG on the survival rate during development to adults of flies expressing the MJDtr-Q78 protein in the nervous system, we crossed flies homozygous for the UAS-MJDtr-Q78S transgene with flies bearing the elav-Gal4 driver transgene in trans to the balancer chromosome (CyO). 50% of the progeny are expected to bear both the elav-Gal4 driver and the UAS-MJDtr-Q78S transgenes (MJDtr-Q78S flies), which express the MJDtr-Q78 protein, whereas 50% of the progeny are expected to bear the UAS-MJDtr-Q78S transgene and CyO (control flies), which do not express the MJDtr-Q78 protein. The ratio of the MJDtr-Q78S flies to the control flies was calculated by dividing the number of emerging flies not bearing CyO (MJDtr-Q78S flies) by that of emerging flies bearing CyO (control flies) to evaluate the survival rate of the MJDtr-Q78S flies during their development to adults. The percentage of rescue of the lethality was calculated by dividing the difference in the survival rate between the 17-AAG-treated and untreated MJDtr-Q78S flies by the decrease in the survival rate of the untreated MJDtr-Q78S flies. At least 100 flies were scored for each treatment condition, and the experiments were repeated three times. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Western Blot Analyses—To assess the effect of 17-AAG on the expression level of the MJDtr-Q78 protein, 10 heads of the MJDtr-Q78S flies treated with 17-AAG (5 μm) were lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C. The resultant supernatants were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were incubated overnight with either a rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) at 1:2000 dilution to detect the MJDtr-Q78 protein or a sheep polyclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO) at 1:4000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-rat Igs antibody (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) or HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep Igs antibody (DakoCytomation) were used at 1:5000 dilution as secondary antibodies. To detect the HSF1 protein in transfected Schneider line 2 (SL2) cell lysates, a mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10; Invitrogen; 1:2000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Igs antibody (DakoCytomation; 1:5000 dilution) were used. The HRP was detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). RT-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was purified from whole bodies or eye-antennal discs of crawling third instar larvae of the MJDtr-Q78S flies and control flies expressing the GAL4 activator protein alone using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and was reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers. We performed PCR analyses of Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp90 mRNAs with the following primers: Hsp70-F, 5′-AGCCGTGCCAGGTTTG-3′ and Hsp70-R, 5′-CGTTCGCCCTCATACA-3′; Hsp40-F, 5′-CATAAAGCAGCCCGTGTAGC-3′ and Hsp40-R, 5′-AGATGTTGAGGCACCGATTC-3′; and Hsp90-F, 5′-CGATTAAGCGACCAGTCGAA-3′ and Hsp90-R, 5′-AAACGACAACTGCTCTTGAATG-3′. As an internal control, mRNA of rp49 (ribosomal protein 49), a housekeeping gene, was also analyzed with the primers rp49-F, 5′-AGCGCACCAAGCACTTCATCCGCCA-3′ and rp49-R, 5′-GCGCACGTTGTGCACCAGGAACTTC-3′. The RT-PCR products were separated on a 3% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For precise quantification, real time quantitative PCR was performed with the above primers and Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Shiga, Japan) using ABI PRISM 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative abundance of each mRNA was calculated by normalizing to rp49 mRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. To compare the expression levels of each mRNA, the ratio of each mRNA/rp49 mRNA of the 17-AAG-treated MJDtr-Q78S flies expressing the MJDtr-Q78 protein alone or co-expressing the HSF1 RNAi was divided by that of the untreated MJDtr-Q78S flies. The experiments were repeated at least three times. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Vector Construction and Generation of Transgenic Fly Lines—For expression of the HSF1 protein, a DNA fragment coding for dHSFa, the major alternatively spliced isoform of Drosophila HSF1 (21Fujikake N. Nagai Y. Popiel H.A. Kano H. Yamaguchi M. Toda T. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), tagged with a c-Myc epitope was inserted into the pUAST vector, to generate the pUAS-HSF1 vector. For the HSF1 knockdown experiment, the pUAS-HSF1-RNAi vector harboring inverted repeats corresponding to the third to fifth exon of the HSF1 cDNA separated by the second intron of the HSF1 gene was constructed according to the strategy for splice activated RNAi. To establish HSF1 RNAi fly lines, the pUAS-HSF1-RNAi vector was injected into fly embryos by standard procedures. Cell Culture and Transfection—SL2 cells, which were derived from late stage fly embryos, were cultured in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 25 °C. To evaluate the efficiency of RNAi-mediated HSF1 knockdown, SL2 cells were co-transfected with the pUAS-HSF1 vector along with either the pUAS-HSF1-RNAi or pUAST empty vector, as well as the pAct5C-GAL4 vector as a driver using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analyses. 17-AAG Treatment Suppresses polyQ-induced Neurodegeneration in Drosophila—To evaluate the therapeutic effects of HSF1-activating compounds, which induce multiple endogenous molecular chaperones, on polyQ-induced neurodegeneration, we chose the following five compounds. GA, a benzo-quinone ansamycin anti-tumor antibiotic, specifically inhibits the activity of Hsp90, a negative regulator of HSF1, resulting in activation of HSF1 (18Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). 17-AAG, a derivative of GA, shares the property to inhibit Hsp90 but has less cytotoxicity than GA (29Page J. Heath J. Fulton R. Yalkowsky E. Tabibi E. Tomaszewski J. Smith A. Rodman L. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 308Google Scholar). RA, an antifungal macrolactone antibiotic, also inhibits the activity of Hsp90 (30Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). CL, a potent anti-inflammatory compound, activates HSF1 through unknown mechanisms (31Westerheide S.D. Bosman J.D. Mbadugha B.N. Kawahara T.L. Matsumoto G. Kim S. Gu W. Devlin J.P. Silverman R.B. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56053-56060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). GGA, an anti-ulcer agent, activates protein kinase C, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of HSF1 (26Yamanaka K. Takahashi N. Ooie T. Kaneda K. Yoshimatsu H. Saikawa T. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 785-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We employed Drosophila polyQ disease models to analyze the therapeutic effects of oral administration of the above compounds, because Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be a useful in vivo model to study polyQ-induced neurodegeneration (27Warrick J.M.

Littleton J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3224-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We administered the above HSF1-activating compounds by mixing them in culture food to the transgenic fly line MJDtr-Q78S, which expresses the MJDtr-Q78 protein in the eye under the gmr promoter, resulting in severe compound eye degeneration (27Warrick J.M.

Treatment with the HSF1-activating compounds revealed that 17-AAG is most effective against polyQ-induced compound eye degeneration (Figs. 1 and 2). 17-AAG treatment at concentrations of 500 nm, 1.5 μm, and 5 μm strongly suppressed polyQ-induced compound eye degeneration (Fig. 2, C-E), whereas treatment at 50 nm showed a moderate therapeutic effect (Fig. 2B). However, 17-AAG treatment at 50 μm unexpectedly failed to improve compound eye degeneration in the MJDtr-Q78S flies (Fig. 2F), indicating that the therapeutic effect of 17-AAG is dose-dependent at least up to 5 μm. Treatment with GA at concentrations of 500 nm and 5 μm also showed modest suppression of polyQ-induced compound eye degeneration (Fig. 1C), whereas treatment at 50 nm and 50 μm did not (data not shown). Treatment with RA at concentrations ranging from 50 nm to 5 μm was also effective against polyQ-induced compound eye degeneration (Fig. 1D). However, treatment with either CL (1 to 100 μm) or GGA (10 μm to 40 mm) did not show any detectable changes (Fig. 1, E and F). Compared with the therapeutic effects of SB, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, which was previously reported"
https://openalex.org/W2066065483,"The iron respiratory chain of the acidophilic bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans involves various metalloenzymes. Here we demonstrate that the oxygen reduction pathway from ferrous iron (named downhill pathway) is organized as a supercomplex constituted of proteins located in the outer and inner membranes as well as in the periplasm. For the first time, the outer membrane-bound cytochrome c Cyc2 was purified, and we showed that it is responsible for iron oxidation and determined that its redox potential is the highest measured to date for a cytochrome c. The organization of metalloproteins inside the supramolecular structure was specified by protein-protein interaction experiments. The isolated complex spanning the two membranes had iron oxidase as well as oxygen reductase activities, indicating functional electron transfer between the first iron electron acceptor, Cyc2, and the CuA center of cytochrome c oxidase aa3. This is the first characterization of a respirasome from an acidophilic bacterium. In Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans,O2 reduction from ferrous iron must be coupled to the energy-consuming reduction of NAD+(P) from ferrous iron (uphill pathway) required for CO2 fixation and other anabolic processes. Besides the proteins involved in the O2 reduction, there were additional proteins in the supercomplex, involved in uphill pathway (bc complex and cytochrome Cyc42), suggesting a possible physical link between these two pathways.

Oxidation of ferrous iron (Fe(II) 2The abbreviations used are: Fe(II)ferrous ironcyt c oxidasecytochrome c oxidaseRcYrusticyaninDDMdodecyl β-d-maltosideTMBZ3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidineBN gelBlue-Native gelBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. ) by microbes is an important component of the iron geochemical cycle (1Croal L.R. Gralnick J.A. Malasarn D. Newman D.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 38: 175-202Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In modern environments, bacteria that can oxidize Fe(II) are ubiquitous, inhabiting and affecting a wide variety of environments where Fe(II) is present. One of these bacteria is Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a Gram-negative strictly acidophilic bacterium that has gained considerable interest because of its use in microbial leaching, and its emerging role as a model for studying organism life in an extreme acidic environment. It is an obligate chemolithotrophe, and the sole energy-producing process that it uses for growth and cell maintenance involves oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and/or Fe(II) under acidic conditions, using O2 as oxidant. Electrons from Fe(II) can either be transported along a “downhill” or a “uphill” electron pathway, toward a higher (O2/H2O) or lower (NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H) potential redox couple (2Rohwerder T. Gehrke T. Kinzler K. Sand W. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2003; 63: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 3Elbehti A. Brasseur G. Lemesle-Meunier D. J.

Acta. 2004; 1656: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The respiratory chain of A. ferrooxidans has been analyzed in detail in recent years. The downhill and uphill pathways, involving proteins encoded by the rus and petI operons, conclude with reduction of the final target by a cytochrome c oxidase (cyt c oxidase) and bc1 complex, respectively (4Brasseur G. Levican G. Bonnefoy V. Holmes D.H. Jedlicki E. Lemesle-Meunier D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1656: 114-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 5Appia-Ayme C. Guiliani N. Ratouchniak J. Bonnefoy V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4781-4787Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite substantial efforts, the pathway between Fe(II) and O2 has not yet been completely elucidated, and new strategies need to be developed to understand the energetics. Nevertheless, there is general agreement that Fe(II) is oxidized on the cell surface at the outer membrane and that cyt c oxidase alone does not catalyze this reaction (6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Bruscella P. Appia-Ayme C. Levican G. Ratouchniak J. Jedlicki E. Holmes D.S.

The organization of rus operon, the subcellular localization of the proteins, and studies of protein-protein interactions all suggest that electron transfer occurs through the high molecular weight c-type cytochrome Cyc2 located in the external membrane, the periplasmic blue copper protein rusticyanin (RcY), the periplasmic dihemic cytochrome c Cyc1, and the aa3 cyt c oxidase. In addition to genes encoding the bc1 complex, a gene coding for a dihemic cytochrome Cyc42 is also present in the petI operon, and it has been recently proposed (7Bruscella P. Appia-Ayme C. Levican G. Ratouchniak J. Jedlicki E. Holmes D.S. Bonnefoy V. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that the bc1 complex receives electrons from this cytochrome and transfers them to the quinol pool. Electrons would then be transferred to the complex I that is supposed to function also in the reverse direction to produce NADP(H) (3Elbehti A. Brasseur G. Lemesle-Meunier D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been proposed (7Bruscella P. Appia-Ayme C. Levican G. Ratouchniak J. Jedlicki E. Holmes D.S. Bonnefoy V. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that the branching point between these two pathways is at the level of RcY. ferrous iron cytochrome c oxidase rusticyanin dodecyl β-d-maltoside 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine Blue-Native gel 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. This raised questions about the electron transfer pathways from Fe(II) to O2 and to NAD(P). In A. ferrooxidans, no efficient genetic systems are available to disrupt genes by a procedure such as homologous recombination. We have used various approaches to probe the physical and energetic coupling between all the proposed components of the downhill oxidizing chain, and we demonstrate a supramolecular organization of the downhill pathway going from the external membrane to the inner one. Bacteria were grown according to Ref. 6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Cells (30 g) were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm BisTris, pH 7, supplemented with 10 μg/ml DNase I (from bovine pancreas; Roche Applied Science) and protease inhibitors (mixture tablets, Complete, Roche Applied Science). They were broken at 18–20 kpsi in a French press cell. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C, then resuspended at a protein concentration of 12 mg/ml, and solubilized in 50 mm BisTris, pH 7, containing 5% glycerol, 750 mm aminocaproic acid (buffer A), and dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM). The suspension was stirred for 3 h at 4°Cand centrifuged at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the solubilized membrane proteins. Samples were concentrated at this step. Nonionic (Triton X-100 and DDM), ionic (sodium deoxycholate), and zwitterionic detergents were also tested for solubilization at 1–3 mg of detergent per mg of proteins and at various pH values (pH 7, pH 4, and pH 2). When specified, nonsolubilized membrane pellets were resuspended in 1 m NaBr, stirred for 2 h at room temperature, and spun at 145,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to remove peripherally bound proteins. For the supercomplex purification, concentrated solubilized proteins were layered on top of a 43-ml 10–20% glycerol gradient formed in buffer A, 0.1% DDM, and centrifuged at 145,000 × g overnight at 4 °C. Fractions 1–9 (5 ml each) were collected from the top of the tube and concentrated. The heaviest fraction of glycerol gradient (18–20%) was applied, after concentration, to a Superose 6 gel filtration (FPLC, 25 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A, 0.02% DDM. The flow was 0.2 ml/min. Molecular weight standards were analyzed under identical conditions. Fractions (0.5 ml) with specific spectroscopic signals of cytochromes and cyt c oxidase were pooled and concentrated. From 600 mg of solubilized proteins, the purification yield was 1.5%. Cytochromes Cyc1, Cyc42, and RcY were purified as described previously (6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Leroy G. Nitschke W. Bruschi M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7205-7211Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cyt c oxidase from A. ferrooxidans was kindly supplied by D. Lemesle (CNRS, Marseilles, France). Cyc2 was purified from solubilized membranes using 10–30% sucrose gradient formed in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5, 0.01% DDM, 0.05% aminocaproic acid, and 5% glycerol (buffer B). Fractions corresponding to 28–30% sucrose, collected from the top of the tube, were concentrated and loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column (FPLC, GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B. Proteins were eluted by a gradient of ammonium acetate from 0.05 to 1 m. The flow was 1 ml/min. Fractions with specific spectroscopic signals of cytochrome c were pooled and concentrated, and proteins were identified by N-terminal sequencing. The orf1 gene that encodes protein ORF1 was amplified from A. ferrooxidans by PCR using oligonucleotides Nter ORF1 (5′-GAAATTCATGGCAGCAAAAAAAGGTATGACTACGG-3′) and Cter ORF1 (5′-AAAGCTTTTAGCTTCCCTGAGCAGGTAGTATGTCAAGAAT-3′), which introduced an EcoRI site immediately upstream from the start codon and a HindIII site downstream the stop codon. The 552 bp obtained by PCR was doubly digested by EcoRI-HindIII and subcloned into pJF119EH, cut with the same enzymes, to obtain pJF119orf1. The sequence of the insert in the resulting plasmid was verified. For purification, 2 liters of cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli TG1pJ119orf1 were grown at 37 °C in aerobic and fermentative conditions (6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) until mid-log phase and then induced with 1 mm of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min, and periplasmic extraction was performed as described previously (6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After dialysis against 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.6, and centrifugation to eliminate precipitated E. coli proteins, the supernatant, containing overproduced protein ORF1, was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.5. Proteins were eluted by a potassium phosphate gradient from 0 to 500 mm, pH 5.5. Recombinant ORF1 protein was detected in the fractions by Western blotting using a specific antibody. Fractions with ORF1 were pooled and concentrated on Centriprep YM 10, and proteins were identified by N-terminal sequencing. 5 mg of antibodies directed against Cyc2 or ORF1 were covalently immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Biosciences) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The column was equilibrated in buffer A, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% DDM, and 400 μg of solubilized membrane proteins were loaded onto the column. After washing steps, elution was performed by two steps with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.4. Fractions obtained were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoreses—Proteins were loaded on 4% polyacrylamide stacking, 10% running SDS or native gels, or 5–15% Blue Native gels according to Ref. 12Schägger H. IUMBMB Life. 2001; 52: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar (MiniProtean3 apparatus, Bio-Rad). After migration, proteins were revealed with Coomassie Blue, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMBZ, specific for hemes) (13Thomas D.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), specific staining for cyt c oxidase and for bc complex, or antibodies. Western Blots—Proteins separated on denaturing or native gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Electran) with the Fast blot apparatus (Biometra) at 5 mA/cm2 for 45 min. Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-Cyc1, anti-Cyc2, anti-CoxB, anti-ORF1, and anti-RcY rabbit sera. The secondary antibody used was the goat peroxidase-conjugate anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) following manufacturer's guidelines. Restore Western blot Stripping Buffer (Pierce) was used for stripping antibodies from blots to enable several reprobings on the same membrane. Far-Western blotting was performed essentially as described (14Edmonso D.G. Roth S.Y. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 1-6Google Scholar). A total amount of 10 μg of purified cyt c oxidase, Cyc1, Cyc2, RcY, and ORF1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer 1 (0.05% Tween/phosphate-buffered saline) and for another 1 h in blocking buffer 2 (5% milk) to allow partial renaturation of the proteins on the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by incubation with each purified bait protein (RcY or Cyc1, 100 μg each) in the protein-binding buffer 2 overnight at 4 °C. Unbound bait proteins were then washed off the membrane with buffer 1 three times, each time for 10 min, and blocked for 1 h in buffer 2. The blot was then incubated with an appropriate diluted primary antibody (anti-RcY or anti-Cyc1) for 1 h, 30 min at room temperature in buffer 2. Finally the membrane was incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG as described above. In-gel Respiratory Complex Detection—Specific staining of respiratory supercomplex containing bc1 complex was achieved as recently described by Wittig and Schägger (15Wittig I. Schägger H. Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 723-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with the protocol using diaminobenzidine to stain complex III heme. Directly after, in-gel activity staining the aa3 cyt c oxidase was performed by adding 1 mg/ml cytochrome c from horse heart (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark with gentle rocking. Control was done in the presence of KCN (1 mm). Ferrocytochrome Oxidation Activity—The oxidation rate of ferrocytochrome c (100 μm) was monitored spectrophotometrically at 552 nm in 20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.8, in the presence or absence of 100 μm KCN with 100 μg of proteins from the 18–20% glycerol gradient fraction. To determine whether electrons arising from this cytochrome might take a pathway other than that via cyt c oxidase, stigmatellin (inhibitor of bc1 complex) at 10 μm was added. Iron Oxidase Activity—Cyt c oxidase activity of the supercomplex (90 or 195 μg), solubilized membranes (360 or 720 μg), or purified aa3 cyt c oxidase (25 or 100 μg) was measured polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Gilson oxygraph) in buffer B with Fe(II) as electron donor. Oxygen consumption was measured at room temperature in a 1.8-ml reaction system. Fe(II) oxidase activity was started by the addition of 28 mm FeSO4. When used, KCN was added at a final concentration of 330 μm. One unit of Fe(II) oxidase activity corresponds to the uptake of 1 nmol of O2/min. Stopped-flow Experiments—The experiments were done as described in Ref. 6Malarte G. Leroy G. Lojou E. Abergel C. Bruschi M. Giudici-Orticoni M.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6471-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. 500 ng of purified complex (around 5 μm cytochromes) oxidized by potassium hexachloroiridate and 10 mm FeCl2 were used. Tryptic digestion of excised gel plugs and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry protein identification were performed as described previously (16Brugna-Guiral M. Tron P. Nitschke W. Stetter K. Burlat B.

The digested samples were also studied by two-dimensional liquid chromatography in tandem mass spectrometer. They were analyzed by an ion trap LCQ-DECAXP mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). For data analysis, protein identification was performed by the SEQUEST algorithm in the BioworksBrowser 3.3 software package (Thermo Electron Corp.). UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer at room temperature. Low temperature spectra were recorded using a dual wavelength DW 2000 SLM-Aminco spectrophotometer with a slit of 0.2–0.4 nm as described in Ref. 17Guiral M. Tron P. Aubert C. Gloter A.

Optical redox titration were performed on a Cary 50 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer at 20 °C according to the method of Dutton (19Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) at pH 4.2 in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 0.01% DDM. The following redox mediators were present at a concentration of 4 μm: ferrocene monocarboxylic acid, ferrocene dicarboxylic acid, p-benzoquinone, 1–2-naphthoquinone, and potassium ferricyanide. The purified cytochrome c (16 μm) was titrated. EPR spectra were recorded at liquid helium temperatures with a Bruker ESP 300e X-band spectrometer fitted with an Oxford Instruments cryostat and temperature control system. EPR spectra were recorded on enriched cytochrome Cyc2 (2 mg/ml) in buffer B and on the supercomplex (11 mg/ml of proteins) in buffer A, 0.01% DDM, 2 mm EDTA. Reduction was achieved with a solution of FeSO4 at the final concentration of 2 mm. Sequences of Burkholderia thailandensis E264, Ralstonia solanacearum, Acidiphilium cryptum, Dechloromonas aromatica, Thiobacillus denitrificans, Rhodoferax ferrireducens and Xanthomonas campestris have been retrieved on line at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Stable Association of Soluble and Membrane-bound Proteins Involved in Electron Transfer—To investigate the organization of the Fe(II) oxidation pathway, we prepared and solubilized membranes using various detergents and detergent/protein ratios at different pH values as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DDM proved to be very suitable for membrane solubilization at pH 7 at a detergent concentration of 3 mg/mg of protein. UV-visible absorption spectra and electrophoresis analysis showed the presence of cytochrome(s) c and membrane proteins as cytochrome(s) b and aa3-type cyt c oxidase in the DDM supernatant (Fig. 1A). In addition, using specific antibodies it was found the presence of proteins known to be soluble in the periplasm (Cyc1 and RcY), which suggests a strong affinity of these proteins for membranes and/or for their membranebound physiological partners (Fig. 1B). To determine whether periplasmic proteins interact with membrane proteins, the solubilized proteins were separated by a 10–20% glycerol density gradient. Nine fractions from the gradients were analyzed by absorption spectra. As controls, purified cytochrome Cyc1, RcY, and cyt c oxidase were subjected also to density gradients in the same conditions. In accordance with their molecular weights, cytochrome Cyc1 (21 kDa) and RcY (16 kDa) are mainly present in the lightest fractions at 12% glycerol, whereas cyt c oxidase (150 kDa) migrates in the intermediary fractions at 15.5% glycerol. Absorption spectra of the fractions showed a different distribution of the same proteins when coming from the DDM supernatant. Indeed, total c-type cytochromes, cyt c oxidase, as well as cytochrome(s) b are mainly found in the heaviest fractions (about 18–20% glycerol; Fig. 2). These data give a clear indication that, in the DDM supernatant, cytochromes c and cyt c oxidase are shifted toward the heaviest fractions of the gradient suggesting the presence of high molecular weight proteins complex(es). The controls with purified proteins exclude aggregation or polymerization as no proteins were found in the 18–20% glycerol fraction. On spheroplast suspension, evidence has been obtained that electrons arising from ferrocytochrome take two pathways as follows: the first one being the classical energy-producing cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase-oxygen pathway (downhill), and the second one corresponding to a protonmotive force-dependent pathway via the bc1 complex and the complex I (uphill) (3Elbehti A. Brasseur G. Lemesle-Meunier D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We have tested the oxidation of exogenous ferrocytochrome c to determine the presence of proteins from downhill and uphill pathways in the 18–20% glycerol fraction (Fig. 3). When added to 100 μg of 18–20% fraction at pH 4.8, exogenous cytochrome c was oxidized. After addition of stigmatellin, a specific complex bc1 inhibitor, either before or after ferrocytochrome c, the rate of oxidation was inhibited at 44%. The oxidation of ferrocytochrome is then abolished in presence of KCN, an inhibitor of cyt c oxidase. These results show the presence of proteins or complexes constituting both the uphill and downhill pathways in 18–20% glycerol fraction. New Respiratory Supercomplex Spanning Both the Inner and Outer Membranes—As our previous results suggest the existence of large complexes containing membrane and soluble proteins, we realized co-immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against Cyc2 provided evidence of the existence of this organization. An immune complex was obtained from DDM supernatant, and 11 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry after separating them on a denaturing gel (Table 1). Four of these proteins are products of genes included in rus operon in the Acidithiobacillus genome: Cyc2, Cyc1, RcY, and a protein (ORF1) of unknown function. This operon contains also four genes encoding the four subunits of the aa3 cyt c oxidase not identified by mass spectrometry, but the presence of submit II (CoxB) is detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies (data not shown). At this step, it was impossible to know if other bound proteins are truly complex subunits or contaminants. This experiment demonstrates the existence of a supercomplex including both soluble (Cyc1 and RcY) and membrane-bound proteins (Cyc2 and cyt c oxidase). To our knowledge, this is the first time that the unknown protein ORF1 is detected interacting with metalloproteins supposed to be involved in the iron oxidation pathway.TABLE 1Identification of immunoprecipitated proteins by mass spectrometry after their separation on denaturing gel (combined data obtained from both MALDI-TOF and ion trap mass spectrometry)Protein nameNCBI entryGeneCoverageaCoverage % means protein sequence coverage by the matching peptides.PeptidesbPeptides means the number of different peptides matching the protein sequence.MasscMass means the theoretical molecular mass of the identified protein calculated from the amino acid sequence without possible processing or modifications.%kDaCyc23282057cyc26.4349.7ORF115209320orf119.7319.9RcY2194027rus681016.2Cyc13282058cyc125.7525.3Major outer membrane protein4138616Omp4021842.2Unknown472419orf118.2733.3Putative maturation protein ResB3790604resB16.1865.5CsoS1B4836668Csos1B43411.5Sulfide quinone reductase70888498sqr27.21947.4Mercuric reductase30179805merA8357.4Glutamine synthase121382gltD9.2351.6a Coverage % means protein sequence coverage by the matching peptides.b Peptides means the number of different peptides matching the protein sequence.c Mass means the theoretical molecular mass of the identified protein calculated from the amino acid sequence without possible processing or modifications. Open table in a new tab The complex was then purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Low temperature optical spectroscopy showed the presence of c-type and b-type cytochromes and the aa3 cyt c oxidase (Fig. 4). b-Type hemes are substoichiometric to c-type hemes (around 1/10) and can be discerned as a shoulder on the red flank of the α-peak of the c-type hemes. To visualize the physical interaction between all the proteins eluted in the same fraction from the gel filtration chromatography, the complex was allowed to migrate on a Blue Native (BN) gel (Fig. 5A). Staining with Coomassie Blue and TMBZ revealed the presence of two bands with a molecular mass of about 300 kDa (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2, respectively, bands 1 and 2). These two bands present a cyt c oxidase activity (Fig. 5A, lane 3) that is specifically inhibited by KCN (data not shown). As the presence of cytochrome b was detected by UV-visible spectroscopy, the bc complex was searched directly in-gel using a specific complex III heme staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two bands (Fig. 5A, lane 4) were revealed with weak intensity compared with the cyt c oxidase activity. This result indicates the presence of a bc complex (or a part) in the supercomplex. All these results demonstrate that two multiprotein complexes with similar molecular weights, each containing an active oxidase and cytochrome(s), are present in the purified fraction. The presence of two bands could be a consequence of a difference in proteins stoichiometry as demonstrated below. Identification of the Complex Components—The composition of the two proteins bands (Fig. 5A) was determined by a proteomic approach, including trypsin digestion of the two individual bands excised from the BN gel and analysis by ion trap mass spectrometry. The major band (Fig. 5A, band 1) contains all components encoded by the rus operon (Cyc1, Cyc2, ORF1, CoxA, and CoxB) except RcY (Table 2). Moreover, in agreement with the optical spectra and in-gel detection, the components of the bc1 complex (cytochromes c1 and b) as well as the dihemic cytochrome Cyc42, whose genes are present in petI operon, were identified. The outer membrane protein OMP40 is also found in the complex, and its presence after isolation of the supercomplex by both co-immunoprecipitation and purification steps suggests that it is not an artifact. Similarly, the association of ORF1 with the electron transfer complex is real as this protein was detected in both experiments. Although an active oxidase is part of the complex, two subunits (CoxC and CoxD) were not detected by mass spectrometry, and one (CoxA) was detected only by three peptides, probably because of the high hydrophobicity of the peptides generated by trypsin digestion of these proteins. The c-type cytochromes are identified with only two peptides because of the covalent binding of hemes to the polypeptidic chain. The third component of bc1 complex (the Rieske protein) is known to be easily lost during purification (10Elbehti A. Nitschke W. Tron P. Michel C. Lemesle-Meunier D. J. Biol.

ROS-induced DNA lesions, including oxidized bases, abasic (AP) sites, and oxidized AP sites, cause DNA strand breaks and are repaired via the base excision repair (BER) pathway in both the nucleus and mitochondria. Repair of damaged bases and AP sites involving 1-nucleotide incorporation, named single nucleotide (SN)-BER, was observed with mitochondrial and nuclear extracts. During SN-BER, the 5′-phosphodeoxyribose (dRP) moiety, generated by AP-endonuclease (APE1), is removed by the lyase activity of DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) and polymerase β in the mitochondria and nucleus, respectively. However, the repair of oxidized deoxyribose fragments at the 5′ terminus after strand break would require 5′-exo/endonuclease activity that is provided by the flap endonuclease (FEN-1) in the nucleus, resulting in multinucleotide repair patch (long patch (LP)-BER). Here we show the presence of a 5′-exo/endonuclease in the mitochondrial extracts of mouse and human cells that is involved in the repair of a lyase-resistant AP site analog via multinucleotide incorporation, upstream and downstream to the lesion site. We conclude that LP-BER also occurs in the mitochondria requiring the 5′-exo/endonuclease and pol γ with 3′-exonuclease activity. Although a FEN-1 antibody cross-reacting species was detected in the mitochondria, it was absent in the LP-BER-proficient APE1 immunocomplex isolated from the mitochondrial extract that contains APE1, pol γ, and DNA ligase 3. The LP-BER activity was marginally affected in FEN-1-depleted mitochondrial extracts, further supporting the involvement of an unidentified 5′-exo/endonuclease in mitochondrial LP-BER.

Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7644) Google Scholar), is extremely susceptible to oxidative damage, presumably because of the lack of protective histones and proximity to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are endogenously generated by the electron transport complexes (3Richter C.

Res. 2002; 509: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Such damage includes several dozen oxidized bases, abasic (AP) sites, and oxidation products of AP sites leading to DNA strand breaks (5Sung J.S. Demple B. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1620-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Endogenous mutations in mtDNA, likely to arise from these lesions, were shown to be considerably higher than in the nuclear genome (6Richter C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Approximately 10,000 AP sites were estimated to be generated per nuclear genome per day (7Lindahl T. Andersson A.

Analysis of the release of 5-methylene-2-furanone, the product of β-, γ-elimination of 2-deoxyribonolactone, an oxidized AP site, causing DNA strand breakage, suggests that this ribonolactone could account for 70% of the total sugar damage in DNA (8Roginskaya M.

Although the mitochondria lack the enzymes to repair UV-photoproducts in the genome (10Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1974; 71: 2777-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), efficient repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA was shown to occur primarily via the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. Some of the mitochondrial isoforms of nuclear BER enzymes have been characterized (11Bogenhagen D.F. Pinz K.G. Perez-Jannotti R.M. Progr. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 257-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in vivo evidence for BER in mitochondria was shown (4Mandavilli B.S. Santos J.H. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 12Larsen N.B. Rasmussen M. Rasmussen L.J. Mitochondrion. 2005; 5: 89-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Details of the BER pathway, based on studies with the nuclear BER enzymes, have been recently reviewed (13Almeida K.H. Sobol R.W. DNA Rep. 2007; 6: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 14Fortini P. Dogliotti E. DNA Rep. 2007; 6: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 15Hegde M.L. Hazra T.K. Mitra S. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Briefly, repair of damage or abnormal bases is initiated with their excision by a DNA glycosylase. A monofunctional glycosylase, e.g. uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), excises U from the DNA to generate an AP site, which is then cleaved by AP-endonuclease (APE1) in the mammalian cell, leaving a 3′-OH group and a nonligatable 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) residue. In the nucleus, this 5′-blocking group could be removed by DNA polymerase β via its intrinsic dRP lyase activity. In the mitochondria, the DNA polymerase γ (pol γ) with similar dRP lyase activity is also able to remove the dRP moiety (16Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the case of oxidized base repair by DNA glycosylases with associated AP lyase activity, e.g. 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), base excision is coupled to strand cleavage at the AP site with generation of 5′-phosphate and 3′-blocking phospho-α,β unsaturated aldehyde (derived from deoxyribose), which is subsequently removed by the intrinsic 3′-phosphodiesterase activity of APE1, leaving a 3′-OH group as a primer terminus for repair synthesis. The absence of an aldehyde group in the oxidized deoxyribose fragment at the 5′ terminus after DNA strand break precludes removal of these lesions by the dRP lyase activity of pol β in the nucleus. In such a case the 5′-blocking group is removed by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1), a 5′-exo/endonuclease (17Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 18Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science (NY). 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Thus, the resulting gap filling by a DNA polymerase and nick-sealing by DNA ligase during BER could proceed via two subpathways: SN-BER where only the damage base is replaced or LP-BER where 2–6 additional nucleotides at the 5′ terminus are removed by FEN-1 followed by resynthesis. In the nucleus, DNA ligase 3 (lig3α) is involved in SN-BER after pol β fills in the single nucleotide gap. FEN-1-mediated gap is likely to be filled in by replicative DNA polymerases δ/ϵ followed by nick-sealing with DNA ligase 1 (lig1). In contrast to the situation in the nucleus with multiple enzymes, pol γ and lig3α are involved in both replication and BER of mtDNA (19Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In this case, 5′-dRP generated after AP site cleavage is removed by the dRP lyase activity of pol γ, similar to that of pol β for the nuclear SN-BER. With mitochondrial extracts of rat liver, the repair of uracil was shown to occur only via the SN-BER process in contrast to the nucleus where LP-BER activity was also documented (4Mandavilli B.S. Santos J.H. Van Houten B. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 127-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, how an oxidized AP site lacking the aldehyde group could be repaired in the mitochondria has not been investigated. Such repair would require the presence of FEN-1 or another 5′-exo/endonuclease in the mitochondria. In this study, we analyzed the repair of a reduced AP site analog and APE1 substrate tetrahydrofuran, which has been extensively used in in vitro BER studies. We provide evidence for LP-BER in human and mouse mitochondria mediated primarily by an unidentified 5′-exo/endonuclease.

All animal experiments were performed according to the NIH Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the UTMB Animal Care and Use Committee (no. 00-01-007A).

Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 207-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial suspensions were then lysed in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Western Blot Analysis—Western analysis was performed as described earlier (23Ramana C.V. Boldogh I. Izumi T. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1998; 95: 5061-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). After electroblotting of proteins, the membranes were sequentially probed with antibodies against calregulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (Sigma), FEN-1 (Bethyl Laboratories or GeneTex, Inc.), lactate dehydrogenase (Chemicon International), subunit β of complex V (Molecular Probes), APE1, EndoG (Novus Biological), pol γ (Abcam or Ref. 16Longley M.J.

S.A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), Lig3 (QED Bioscience Inc.), and PCNA (Bethyl Laboratories). The bound primary antibodies were quantitated by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP; Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were washed, incubated in ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences), visualized, and analyzed using Gel Logic 2200 (Kodak) and Kodak Molecular Imaging Software (Kodak), respectively. DNA Repair Synthesis Assay—DNA repair assay was carried out as described earlier, with slight modifications (24Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Rep. 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture (20 μl) contained 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 3% glycerol, 20 μm of each unlabeled dNTPs, 4 μCi of one of the [α-32P]dNTPs, mitochondrial protein extract (5–10 μg) and various duplex oligo substrates (Table 1). After incubation at 37 °C for various times, the substrates and products were separated by electrophoresis in 20% acrylamide/7 m urea gel. The radioactivity in these bands was quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using ImageQuant software. Preliminary enzyme assays were carried out to ensure the linearity of reaction with respect to both time and amount of extract. 5′and 3′-Terminal Labeling of Oligonucleotides—Oligo5 was labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs) as described earlier (25Izumi T. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 3′-End labeling was performed for an oligonucleotide with the same sequence as oligo5 but one nucleotide shorter at the 3′ terminus. After annealing with the complementary oligo, the 1-nt 5′-overhang was used as the template for filling with [α-32P]dTMP at the 3′-end using 3′-exo-deficient DNA polymerase (Klenow Fragment, New England BioLabs). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed using the standard procedure after lysing mitochondria or nuclei in nondenaturing lysis buffer (NLB) containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. FLAG-specific immunoprecipitation was performed using 70 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose from mouse, washed twice with TBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and then incubated with ∼1 mg of mitochondrial extract isolated from HCT116 cells that were transfected with human APE1 cDNA cloned into a C-terminal pFLAG-CMV-5.1 vector (Sigma), for 4 h at 4 °C in a tube rotator. To remove nonspecific proteins, four washes with TBS buffer were performed, and the final pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer for Western analysis or in PBS for repair activity assay. Immunoprecipitation with FEN-1 antibody was performed by first immobilizing the antibody on protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) in PBS buffer for 2 h at room temperature in a tube rotator. Unbound antibody was removed by three washes with PBS and once with NLB. Nuclear or mitochondrial extract was then added to immobilized FEN-1 antibody and further incubated overnight at 4 °C in a tube rotator. After removing nonspecific proteins by four washes with PBS, the final pellet was resuspended in SDS sample buffer. FEN-1 Down-regulation with siRNA—HCT116 cells were transfected with 25 nm FEN-1-specific or control siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. To optimize the siRNA concentration, preliminary transfections were carried out with 1–100 nm FEN-1-specific siRNA. Purity of Mitochondrial Extracts—It is now evident that DNA repair proteins are not exclusively localized in the nucleus or mitochondria, and that a variable but significant fraction could also be found in the cytoplasm. It is thus critical to isolate mitochondrial fraction free of adherent cytosolic proteins when examining mitochondria-specific repair. Several methods have been used to ensure the purity of mitochondria. In our laboratory, to obtain pure mitochondrial extracts, we routinely treat purified mitochondria with trypsin. In previous reports, we showed the importance of this treatment to remove cellular contamination, mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum (26Szczesny B. Hazra T.K. Papaconstantinou J. Mitra S. Boldogh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10670-10675Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Szczesny B. Mitra S. Mechanisms Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Western analysis of mitochondrial fractions of mouse liver and kidney and human HCT116 cells confirmed the absence of cytoplasmic (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), endoplasmic reticulum (calregulin), and cytoskeletal (β-actin) contamination in our mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 1A). Only mitochondrial extracts verified by Western analysis were used in further studies. SN-BER and LP-BER Activities in Mitochondrial Extracts—To confirm repair competence of mitochondrial extracts, oligo2 was annealed to the complementary oligo containing G opposite to U (Table 1), and the duplex was incubated only with [α-32P]dCTP and mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 1B). Mitochondrial extracts of mouse liver and kidney (lanes 2, 3 and 6, 7, respectively) catalyzed incorporation of [α-32P]dCMP in the absence of other dNTPs, indicating that the purified extract carried out SN-BER of uracil. The absence of [α-32P]dCMP incorporation into control oligo1 without U (lanes 4, 5 and 8, 9) indicated specificity of DNA repair. To examine the ability of mitochondria to carry out LP-BER, the THF-containing oligo3 duplex (Table 1) was used as the substrate. Fig. 1C shows DNA repair assay with mitochondrial extracts from HCT116 cells. Incorporation of all four deoxynucleotides in the substrate indicated multibase repair patch (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–7). Again, control oligo1 duplex with normal bases did not incorporate [α-32P]dCMP or [α-32P]dTMP, confirming specific repair synthesis (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, no radioactivity was incorporated into the substrate in the absence of mitochondrial extract (Fig. 1C, lane 8). Furthermore, the presence of radioactivity in the unligated product was observed primarily when [α-32P]dGTP was used (Fig. 1C, lane 6). Authentic LP-BER and Not Strand Displacement Synthesis with Mitochondrial Extracts—A potential complication of analyzing LP-BER using mitochondrial extracts is the robust strand displacement activity of pol γ as a result of which the downstream fragment in the oligo duplex after a strand break could be removed and followed by resynthesis of the entire strand. This could be mistaken for repair and is of particular concern with short oligo substrates, which does not require the 5′-end processing activity of a 5′-exo/endonuclease. We tested for such a possibility and the presence of authentic LP-BER activity in the mitochondrial extracts several ways. First, we used an oligo duplex with 10 additional bases on the 3′-side of the THF lesion. Strand displacement/resynthesis would be reflected in comparable incorporation of deoxynucleotides at distal versus proximal sites relative to the lesion. Secondly, we radiolabeled the THF-containing strand at the 3′ terminus. Once the strand is cleaved by APE1, the label would be permanently lost if strand displacement/synthesis occurs. On the other hand, in the case of true repair, the radiolabeled 21-nt fragment generated by APE1 would be converted into the full-length oligo after resynthesis of a short (2–8 nt) gap by pol γ. To characterize LP-BER activity of mitochondrial extracts, the repair of THF-containing oligo5 labeled at the 5′ or 3′ terminus with 32P was carried out (Table 1). First, we analyzed the size of 5′-end-labeled oligo4, which does not contain any damage, after its incubation with mitochondrial extract of young liver, and we could not detect any qualitative changes (Fig. 2A). We then analyzed the size of 5′-end-labeled oligo5 after incubation with mouse liver mitochondrial extracts from young mice. The appearance of a 30-nt band indicated cleavage of the substrate by mitochondrial APE1 at the THF site. Slow restoration of the 52-nt band indicated repair (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–6). We detected up to 2–3-fold increase in complete repair product formation as a function of incubation time. The 30-nt band was not observed when control oligo4 was used, confirming the synthesis to be damage-specific (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–5). In a parallel experiment, 3′-end-labeled oligo5 duplex was incubated with liver mitochondrial extracts isolated from young mice. Again the appearance of a 21-nt band after 5 min of incubation indicated strand cleavage at the THF site by APE1 (Fig. 2C, lane 2), and time-dependent restoration of the 52-nt band indicated complete repair (Fig. 2C, lanes 2–5). Some intermediate sized bands were also visible. As expected, the smaller bands were absent in the control containing no mitochondrial extract (Fig. 2, B and C, lanes 7 and 6, respectively). In all experiments, some loss of the 52-nt band occurred, which was likely due to nonspecific degradation. This should perhaps be expected because of the presence of multiple nucleases in crude mitochondrial extracts. This is also evident from of undamaged control oligo (Fig. 2A). In particular, the 3′- and 5′-terminally radiolabeled oligos could be readily removed by the exonuclease. Nevertheless, the restoration of the 52-nt full-length oligo after incubation with both 5′- and 3′-terminally radiolabeled substrates (Fig. 2, B and C) was consistent with initial strand break at the THF site followed by repair synthesis and ligation. Fig. 2C also strongly argues against strand displacement synthesis in which the 3′-terminal label would be irreversibly lost. Similar experiments were carried out with unlabeled oligo5 substrate in the presence of each radiolabeled dNTPs and mitochondrial extracts from liver (Fig. 2D). Incorporation of radioactivity confirmed that the mitochondrial extracts carried out LP-BER (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–4). It needs to be emphasized that similar experiments were performed using mitochondrial extracts isolated from young mouse kidney and HCT116 cells with similar results (data not shown). Taken these data together, we conclude that mitochondrial extracts from various mammalian tissues and human cells could perform LP-BER. Characterization of Long Patch Repair Product—pol γ, the sole mitochondrial DNA polymerase, is responsible for mtDNA replication and also participates in BER (19Pinz K.G. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, it is the only mammalian DNA polymerase possessing both 3′-5′ exonuclease and dRP lyase activities (16Longley M.J. Prasad R. Srivastava D.K. Wilson S.H. Copeland W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1998; 95: 12244-12248Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Incorporation of multiple nucleotides in the THF oligo substrate could thus be due to the filling of gap generated by the 3′-exonuclease activity of pol γ or a 5′-exo/endonuclease, such as FEN-1, or both. To establish the directionality of repair synthesis, we designed the sequence of oligo6 (Table 1) such that incorporation of [α-32P]dTMP and [α-32P]dCMP would indicate resynthesis of DNA 3′-5′ and 5′-3′ to the THF site, respectively. Fig. 2E shows incorporation of [α-32P]dAMP and [α-32P]dGMP into oligo6, indicating repair of the intact template by HCT116 mitochondrial extracts. In addition, appearance of the radiolabeled 31-nt band, especially when [α-32P]dGTP was used, indicated incorporation of [α-32P]dGMP at the THF site after strand cleavage. Persistence of the cleaved and radiolabeled fragment strongly suggests that its ligation or 3′-exonucleolytic processing of the downstream fragment was rate-limiting. However, the radiolabeled 31-nt band, observed after [α-32P]dAMP incorporation suggests resynthesis of the template 5′ to the THF site, which is removed by the 3′-exonuclease activity of pol γ (Table 1). Radiolabeling of the 52-nt band by [α-32P]dCMP and [α-32P]dTMP indicated repair due to replacement of the nucleotides on both sides of the THF (Fig. 2F). The 31-nt band with [α-32P]dTMP incorporation likely represented the unligated repair intermediate. Fragments that are shorter than 30 nt and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dTMP were likely to represent incomplete synthesis after exonucleolytic degradation by pol γ, and similar fragments were observed after [α-32P]dGMP incorporation (Fig. 2E, lanes 6–9). We could not detect labeling of the 31-nt band with [α-32P]dCMP, which could be only incorporated at the 3′-site of the damage (Table 1). The band longer than 30 nt represented the flap generated after repair synthesis. Similar experiments with mitochondrial extracts from mouse liver and kidney yielded comparable results (data not shown). Summarizing the results, we conclude that mitochondrial repair of an AP site analog involved the replacement of deoxynucleotides on both sides of the damage, which may be unique to mitochondrial LP-BER. Mitochondrial-specific Proteins Involved in LP-BER—We recently observed that the immunocomplex for a DNA glycosylase could be isolated from nuclear extracts, and that contains all proteins necessary for carrying out complete BER (24Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Rep. 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether similar immunocomplexes could be isolated from mitochondrial extracts. Because of the availability of highly specific FLAG antibody for isolating immunocomplexes, we ectopically expressed C-terminal FLAG-tagged APE1 in HCT116 cells at a level comparable to endogenous APE1. The APE1-FLAG immunocomplex (IP), isolated from the mitochondrial extracts of these cells, was used for repair of THF in oligo3 (Table 1). We assessed LP-BER by monitoring incorporation of [α-32P]dTMP as before. Fig. 3A shows that the IP of APE1-FLAG (lanes 4 and 5) but not of the vector control (lanes 2 and 3) incorporated [α-32P]dTMP, suggesting that the immunocomplex contains all proteins required to carry out LP-BER. To further characterize the repair synthesis, we performed incorporation assays using each of the four [α-32P]dNTPs. All 4 dNMPs were incorporated into the oligo3 duplex (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–7), and intermediates of the repair reaction were visible. DNA synthesis due to repair was confirmed using control oligo1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). The absence of radiolabeled fragments in the control oligo further supports our conclusions that the DNA synthesis observed for the THF-oligo was due to the true repair and not resynthesis of the undamaged DNA after exonucleolytic degradation. These results provide the first evidence that mitochondrial BER is also carried out by a repair complex as we had observed earlier for repair of 5-hydroxyuracil with NEIL2 IP isolated from the nuclear extract (24Das A. Wiederhold L. Leppard J.B. Kedar P. Prasad R. Wang H. Boldogh I. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. Mitra S. Hazra T.K. DNA Rep. 2006; 5: 1439-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We then tested for the presence of other BER proteins in the IP. In addition to APE1, both catalytic and accessory subunits of pol γ as well as lig3 could be detected by Western analysis (Fig. 3C). Because removal of the THF residue at the 5′ terminus of APE1-med"

Type I IFN induction involves ubiquitin and Ubl modifications of multiple signaling molecules. For example, RIG-I is modified by ubiquitin by at least two independent E3 ligases, TRIM25 and RNF125, to positively and negatively regulate type I IFN production, respectively (18Arimoto K.

IRF7 is reported to interact with the TNF receptor-associated adaptor protein RIP in the presence of an EBV oncoprotein, which enhances IRF7 ubiquitination and activation (24Huye L.E. Ning S.

SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 appear to modify both common and different substrates, including a number of transcription factors (13Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 14Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Many SUMOylated proteins possess the consensus motif, ψKXE, where ψ is a hydrophobic residue, X is any residue, and K is the SUMO acceptor lysine (26Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The unique SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, recognizes the consensus motif and transfers SUMO to the acceptor lysine residue in the substrate (12Gill G. Gene Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). SUMOylation of transcription factors is generally associated with transcriptional repression, although there are some exceptions (13Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 14Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Transcription factors of the IRF family regulate the entire type I IFN system from induction of IFNs to diverse IFN responses (9Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 11Honda K. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T.

Chem. 2007; 282: 20065-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Among IRF members, IRF1 is shown to be covalently conjugated to SUMO1, and this SUMOylation appears to be linked to transcriptional inhibition (28Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Prompted by this report, we asked whether other members of the IRF family are also SUMOylated. In this paper, we show that, indeed, IRF3 and IRF7 are covalently conjugated to SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3, and the SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 was markedly increased following virus infection. Virus-induced SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 was a consequence of TLR and RIG-I activation but not of IFN signaling. We also found that prevention of SUMOylation from IRF3 and IRF7 through the mutation of SUMOylation sites leads to increased IFNα4 and IFNβ mRNA expression following viral infection. Our findings support the view that virus-mediated IRF3 and IRF7 SUMOylation represents postactivation attenuation of IFN gene transcription. Reagents—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against FLAG M2, α-tubulin, anti-FLAG-agarose beads, and protein A-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal antibody for the V5-tag and rabbit and mouse antibodies for the T7-tag were purchased from Invitrogen, Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and Novagen (Gibbstown, NJ), respectively. Antibodies against STAT1, STAT2, and PKR were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and those against SUMO1 and murine IRF3 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against Ubc9 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and recombinant human IFNβ was from Toray Industries, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase was obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Cell Culture and Virus Infection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells and human 2fTGH, U3A, U4A, U5A, and U6A cells (gifts from Dr. G. Stark of Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. For virus inoculation, medium was removed from the culture dish, and cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) at an MOI of 1 for 1 h. Then fresh medium was added to the cells, and the culture was allowed to continue for the indicated periods of time. Constructs—cDNA fragments of IRF3, IRF7, VISA, TRIF, SUMO2, and SUMO3 were generated from total RNA prepared from NIH3T3 cells by RT-PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1 with a FLAG tag at the C terminus or a V5 tag at the N terminus. To construct mutants for IRF3 and IRF7, appropriate substitutions were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-IRF7-FLAG and pcDNA3.1-IRF3-FLAG using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A plasmid expressing a T7-tagged SUMO1 (pCGT-T7-SUMO1) was a gift from Dr. H. Yokosawa of Hokkaido University. A T7-tagged SUMO2 expressing plasmid, pCGT-T7-SUMO2, was constructed by substitution of the SUMO1 open reading frame with SUMO2. For constructing an shRNA retroviral vector targeting Ubc9, an oligonucleotide fragment (5′-ggtccgagcacaagcgaagaa-3′) was inserted into pSUPER.retro (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). Retroviral preparations were produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, a retroviral vector with a scrambled oligonucleotide fragment was prepared and tested in parallel. Detection of SUMO-conjugated Proteins—To detect SUMO conjugation of IRF3 and IRF7, 293T cells (3 × 106) or 2fTGH cells (4 × 105) were transfected with a total of 3.3 or 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamin 2000 and Lipofectamin LRX (Invitrogen), respectively. Twelve h later, cells were stimulated with VSV or IFNβ for indicated time periods. Cells were washed and lysed in Lysis buffer, containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4 mm EDTA, 0.1% NaDOC, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose overnight with gentle rotation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed 4 times with Lysis buffer, and separated on SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunobblot analysis. For detecting SUMOyated IRF3 and IRF7, NIH3T3 cells (5 × 107) expressing control or Ubc9 shRNA were infected by VSV at an MOI of 1 for the indicated periods of time. Whole cell extracts were incubated with 5 μg of anti-mouse IRF3 antibody and protein A-agarose overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed six times with Lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblot using the indicated antibodies. Phos-tag SDS-PAGE—293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-IRF3-FLAG together with a serial dilution of V5-VISA expression plasmid. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were lysed in Lysis buffer without EDTA. Whole cell extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE with or without 75 mm phos-tag acrylamide AAL-107 (NARD institute, Hyogo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. For dephosphorylation experiments, extracts were incubated with or without calf intestine alkaline phosphatase in calf intestine alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were diluted with lysis buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE with or without 75 mm phos-tag acrylamide. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—NIH-3T3 cells (2 × 105) were transfected with 2.5 μg of indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX. Twelve h after transfection, cells were infected with VSV or EMCV at an MOI of 1 for the indicated periods. Total RNA prepared with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was reverse transcribed with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Sciences). The amount of IFNβ, IFNα4, and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase cDNA were measured by using Universal ProbeLibrary and LightCycler 480 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR were designed by the ProbeFinder software (Roche Applied Science). IRF3 and IRF7 Are Modified by SUMO1, -2, and -3—To investigate whether IRF7 has a potential to be conjugated to SUMO molecules, FLAG-tagged IRF7 was introduced into 293T cells together with T7-tagged SUMO1 (Fig. 1A). Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-bound agarose beads, and precipitates were tested for T7-SUMO by immunoblot analysis. A band of ∼70 kDa that reacted with antibody for SUMO1 was detected in samples transfected with FLAG-IRF7 and T7-SUMO1 (open arrowhead in Fig. 1A, top). This band was not detected in cells transfected with SUMO1 alone. Assuming the size of SUMO1 to be ∼12 kDa and that of IRF7 to be 55 kDa, this 70 kDa band was most likely to be a SUMOylated IRF7. Similarly, when FLAG-IRF7 was co-expressed with V5-tagged SUMO3, IRF7 precipitates showed a ∼70 kDa band with V5 SUMO3 reactivity (Fig. 1B, top). Likewise, FLAG-IRF3, when co-introduced with T7-SUMO1 or V5-SUMO3 precipitated a ∼70-kDa band with a respective SUMO reactivity (Fig. 1, C and D, top). Similarly, we observed SUMOylation of IRF7 and IRF3 by SUMO2 (Fig. S1A, lane 6; data not shown). These results indicate that both IRF3 and IRF7 can be modified by SUMO1, -2, and -3. Identification of SUMO Acceptor Sites in IRF3 and IRF7—The SUMOplot prediction program (available on the World Wide Web) revealed two putative SUMOylation sites in IRF7 that carried the ψKXE motif and five in IRF3 (Fig. 2A). To test if these sites are functional SUMO conjugation sites, a Lys → Arg mutation was introduced into each of these sites in IRF3 and IRF7, and the mutants were tested for SUMO conjugation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the IRF7 K406R mutant failed to conjugate SUMO1 (top), whereas wild type (WT) IRF7 and the K43R mutant were clearly SUMOylated. IRF7 K406R was expressed at levels comparable with WT IRF7 as well as K43R, indicating that the lack of SUMOylation in this mutant was not due to a reduced protein expression. For IRF3, all mutants except K152R produced bands conjugated to SUMO1 (Fig. 2C). This was true for IRF3 K359R, in which the mutation was placed in the position equivalent to that of IRF7 K406R. This mutant was SUMOylated as well as WT IRF3. Similar results were obtained when IRF7 and IRF3 mutants were co-expressed with SUMO2 or SUMO3 (Fig. S1, A-C; data not shown). These results indicate that Lys406 of IRF7 and Lys152 of IRF3 serve as a conjugation site for SUMO1, -2, and -3. Virus Infection Increases SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7—Having found that IRF3 and IRF7 can conjugate SUMO1, -2, and -3, it was of interest to assess events that may trigger SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7. Given that IRF3 and IRF7 are activated upon virus infection, we tested whether their SUMOylation is stimulated by virus infection. In Fig. 3, A and B, 293T cells expressing FLAG-IRF7 and T7-SUMO1 or V5-SUMO3 were infected with VSV, and IRF7 SUMOylation was tested by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Little SUMO conjugation was observed without viral infection. However, IRF7 showed a clear increase in SUMO1 and SUMO3 conjugation at 12 and 24 h after virus infection. Similarly, VSV infection led to SUMOylation of IRF3 both with SUMO1 and SUMO3 (Fig. 3, C and D). Interestingly, the levels of SUMOylation were the greatest at 12 h after viral infection for both IRF3 and IRF7; little SUMO conjugation was seen at 3 h for IRF3. Increased SUMOylation observed after viral infection was not due to changes in the expression levels for IRF3/IRF7 or SUMO1/3, since they remained constant for 12 h after viral infection (Fig. 3, A-D, bottom). We felt it important to determine whether endogenous IRF3 and IRF7 are SUMOylated in a natural setting. To this end, NIH3T3 cells were infected with VSV, and IRF3 immunoprecipitates were tested for reactivity with SUMO1 (Fig. 3E, left in top panel). A very low level of SUMOylated IRF3 was observed before infection, and SUMOylated IRF3 was markedly increased at 6 and 12 h after VSV infection (see the ∼70 kDa band in the top panel). The level of SUMO conjugation was greater at 12 h than 6 h, consistent with the data in Fig. 3, A-D. These results demonstrate that VSV infection triggers SUMOylation of endogenous IRF3. To further substantiate the authenticity of the virus-induced IRF3 SUMOylation, we tested the effect of shRNA for Ubc9, a sole E2 enzyme for SUMO conjugation (12Gill G. Gene Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 13Gill G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 14Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Expression of the shRNA drastically reduced Ubc9 expression without affecting IRF3 expression (Fig. 3E, right in top panel). IRF3 SUMOylation was completely abrogated in these cells, indicating that this SUMOylation was dependent on Ubc9 and the endogenous SUMOylation cascade. It should be noted here that it was not possible to test SUMOylation of endogenous IRF7 or SUMO3 modifications due to their very low expression levels. SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 Represses Type I IFN Gene Expression—Virus-mediated SUMOylation observed above pointed to the possibility that SUMO modification regulates functional activity of IRF3 and IRF7. To test this possibility, we examined whether mutations in SUMOylation sites in IRF3 and IRF7 affect virus-induced type I IFN induction. NIH3T3 cells transfected with WT IRF7 or the SUMOylation-defective mutant IRF7 K406R were stimulated with VSV for 9 h. Then IFNβ and IFNα4 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4A, top left and middle). Expression of WT IRF7 markedly increased both IFN mRNAs upon VSV infection. Importantly, overexpression of IRF7 K406R mutant led to a further increase in the expression of both IFNβ mRNA and IFNα4 mRNAs. Similarly, this mutant gave increased IFNβ mRNA following EMCV infection relative to WT IRF7 (Fig. 4B). Expression of WT IRF7 and the K406R mutant was comparable throughout 9 h of viral infection (Fig. 4A, right). Considering that transfection efficiency monitored by immunofluorescent staining of FLAG-IRF7 was consistently ∼50% (data not shown) and that the endogenous IRF7 participated in IFN induction, the increase in IFN mRNA expression detected by the Lys406 mutant probably represents an underestimate. Results with WT IRF3 and the K152R mutant are shown in Fig. 4, C and D. In agreement with the data for IRF7, the K152R mutant yielded substantially higher levels of IFNβ mRNA and IFNα4 mRNA compared with WT IRF3 upon VSV infection. Similarly, the mutant gave higher IFNβ induction upon infection with EMCV than WT IRF3. Interestingly, the enhanced type I IFN mRNA expression by the mutant was evident at 9-12 h after infection and was not seen at 6 h, which appeared in line with delayed IRF3 and IRF7 SUMOylation after virus infection (compare with data in Fig. 3). These results indicate that SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 negatively regulate virus-induced type I IFN expression. TLR and RIG-I/MDA-5 Signaling Mediates SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7—The above data indicate that virus induced SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 leads to inhibition of type I IFN transcription. We next investigated signaling pathways that may mediate SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7. VISA (also called Cardif, MAVS, or IPS-1) is a signaling molecule involved in the RIG-I/MDA-5-activated pathway (3Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 29Qi B. Huang Y. Rowe D. Halliday G. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and exogenously expressed VISA can activate IRF3 and IRF7 (30Kawai T. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O.

Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). In Fig. 5A, co-transfection of V5-tagged VISA led to SUMOylation of IRF3 in a VISA dose-dependent manner. SUMOylation of IRF7 was also increased by co-expression of VISA (Fig. S2). TRIF is an adaptor molecule contributing within the TLR signaling pathway, and ectopic TRIF expression results in activation of IRF3 and IRF7 (34Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Similar to VISA, co-expression of V5-TRIF markedly increased SUMOylated IRF3 (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that IRF3 and IRF7 are SUMOylated as a result of TLR and RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling. VISA-induced SUMOylation Does Not Affect Phosphorylation of IRF3—IRF3 and IRF7 are phosphorylated in response to TLR and RIG-I/MDA-5 signaling, marking their activation (3Kawai T. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar, 11Honda K. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Immunity. 2006; 25: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). We sought to address whether phosphorylation and SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 were internally coupled and take place in a mutually dependent manner. To this end, we first examined whether WT IRF3 and IRF3 K152R, the SUMOylation-defective mutant, could be phosphorylated upon VISA stimulation. To detect phosphorylated IRF3, the phos-tag SDS-PAGE was employed, in which phosphorylated proteins migrate more slowly than unphosphorylated counterparts (36Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Takiyama K. Koike T. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A (top), when co-expressed with VISA, both WT IRF3 and IRF3 K152R produced multiple slower migrating IRF3 bands, in addition to the unphosphorylated IRF3 band in a VISA dose-dependent manner. The band patterns produced by the WT IRF3 and IRF3 K152R in the phos-tag SDS-PAGE were very similar to each other. The appearance of the slowly migrating IRF3 bands detected after VISA co-expression was attributed to phosphorylation, since these bands were no longer detected following phosphatase (calf intestine alkaline phosphatase) treatment (Fig. S3A). A faint, slowly migrating band was found both in WT IRF3 and IRF3 K152R without VISA treatment, which was abolished after calf intestine alkaline phosphatase treatment, indicating a low level of constitutively activated IRF3. In the conventional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A, middle; data not shown), both WT IRF3 and IRF3 K152R migrated to a single position irrespective of VISA expression. These results show that VISA activation leads to IRF3 phosphorylation both in WT IRF3 and IRF3 Lys152, indicating that phosphorylation of IRF3 does not require SUMOylation. IRF3 and IRF7 SUMOylation Does Not Depend on Phosphorylation—We then sought to examine whether SUMOylation of IRF3 and IRF7 is dependent on phosphorylation. To this end, mutants defective in phosphorylation were constructed. In Fig. 2, serines at amino acid positions 425 and 426 in IRF7 and those at 378 and 379 in IRF3 were replaced by alanine to generate IRF3/J2A and IRF7"

Here, protein secretion was studied during the communication between the roots of two plants (Medicago sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana) and the bacterial symbiont of one of these species (Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021) and an opportunistic bacterial pathogen of A. thaliana (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000) using a proteomic approach. It was found that protein exudation in the M. sativa-S. meliloti interaction caused an increase in the secretion of seven plant proteins, such as hydrolases, peptidases, and peroxidases among others in two or more time points compared with the plant control. In addition, four proteins, all of bacterial origin, were increased 1.5-fold more in this interaction compared with S. meliloti alone. However, these proteins were not induced when M. sativa was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000. The interaction between A. thaliana and P. syringae DC3000 highly induced the secretion of several plant proteins related to defense soon after initial contact with P. syringae, but these proteins were not secreted in the incompatible interaction with S. meliloti. The results of this study reveal a specific, protein level cross-talk between roots and microbes.

Plants experience numerous biotic interactions under natural environmental conditions (1Wardle D.A. Ecol.

The initial recognition between roots and microorganisms depends on a wide range of signals emanating from both plants and microbes. On the root side, the main signals come in the form of root exudates, a complex mixture of chemicals, including carbohydrates, phenolics, flavonoids, and proteins (7Bais H.P. Park S.W. Weir T. Callaway R.M. Vivanco J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2004; 9: 26-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The composition of the phytochemicals present in the root exudates tends to vary, depending on the nature of the interaction, and is probably controlled by a network of root transporters and specific genes (8Loyola-Vargas V.M.

On the microbial side, bacteria release quorum-sensing signals to regulate their population density, and these signals have been shown to induce changes in the accumulation of root proteins (13Mathesius U.

Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), although it is well known that host root exudates play a key role in the stimulation of hyphal growth (15Harrison M.J. Annu. Rev.

Matsuzaki K. Hayashi H. Nature. 2005; 435: 824-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Roots and soil bacteria are engaged in highly specific chemical communication, leading to biologically significant interactions (2Bais H.P. Weir T.L. Perry L.G. Gilroy S. Vivanco J.M. Annu. Rev.

However, new information has shown that not only the nod genes are responsible for early nodulation events. For instance, the photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium, which does not have nod genes in its genome, has shown that purine derivatives are required to initiate nodule formation (25Giraud E. Moulin L. Vallenet D. Barbe V. Cytryn E. Avarre J.C. Jaubert M. Simon D. Cartieaux F. Prin Y. Bena G. Hannibal L. Fardoux J. Kojadinovic M. Vuillet L. Lajus A. Cruveiller S. Rouy Z. Mangenot S. Segurens B.

Science. 2007; 316: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The studies of signals between rhizobia and legumes have been restricted to secondary metabolites released from the roots or carbohydrates secreted from the bacteria (21Hartwig U.A. Joseph C.M. Phillips D.A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Currier W.W. Strobel G.A. Plant Physiol. 1976; 57: 820-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fraysse N.

However, other compounds, particularly macromolecules such as proteins, may also be involved in this process. For instance, in the symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and the luminous bacterium Vibrio fischeri, the bacteria enhance the production of an enzyme in the symbiotic organ of the squid, functionally similar to the mammalian myeloperoxidase, that plays an important role in the initial interaction required for the squid's luminescence (30Weis V.M. Small A.L. McFall-Ngai M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This enzyme helps control the symbiont specificity and bacteria growth. In mammals, this protein participates in a complex antimicrobial response. Further, a member of the mindin-F-sapondin family of secreted extracellular matrix proteins in bacteria accounts for a unique pattern recognition molecule in the extracellular matrix of the bacteria that is essential for the initiation of the immune response in mice (31He Y.W. Li H. Zhang J. Hsu C.L. Lin E. Zhang N. Guo J. Forbush K.A. Bevan M.J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In plants, proteins are only recently being recognized as key players in the recognition of and resistance to bacterial pathogens (32Chinchilla D. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Kemmerling B. Nurnberger T. Jones J.D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Nature. 2007; 448: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). For instance, the most abundant bacterial protein elongation factor Tu elicits innate immunity in A. thaliana, contributing to its resistance to bacterial pathogens (33Kunze G. Zipfel C. Robatzek S. Niehaus K. Boller T. Felix G. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3496-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Given the lack of information about the participation of protein signals in the interaction between plant roots and soil microbes, we provide in this study a detailed proteomic analysis and comparison of protein secretion during the early interaction between the roots of two plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago sativa, with two bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Sinorhizobium meliloti strain Rm1021. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 (wild type) seeds were purchased from Lehle Seeds (Round Rock, TX), and M. sativa (Organic Crop Improvement Association (OCIA)-certified) seeds were obtained from a local store (Fort Collins, CO). The seeds were surface-sterilized with 3% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for 2 min for A. thaliana and 20 min for M. sativa, followed by three washes with sterile distilled water. The seeds of both plants were germinated on solidified Murashige-Skoog (34Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53362) Google Scholar) medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose in a growth chamber at 25 ± 2 °C and 16/8-h day/night photoperiod. Each individual 7-day-old plant was transferred into one Magenta box containing 15 ml of liquid Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with 3% (w/v) sucrose and placed on a shaker set at 70 rpm, 24 ± 2 °C under a photoperiod of 16/8 h. Sixty Magenta boxes containing one plant each were used for each replicate of the different experiments, as described below. Time Course Collection of Root Exudates—A. thaliana Col-0 (wild type) and M. sativa plantlets were grown in Magenta boxes as described above. At 21 days, each plant was washed three times with sterile distilled water and transferred to a new Magenta box containing 10 ml of fresh Murashige-Skoog medium. At intervals of 6, 12, and 24 h post-transfer, the exudates of plants in 60 separate Magenta boxes were collected, pooled, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the root sheathing. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter, and the filtrate was concentrated to 500 μl by passing through Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cut-off 5000; Millipore). Root-exuded proteins were stored at –80 °C until use. For the collection of exudates from roots inoculated with microorganisms, we used P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (35Moore R.A. Starratt A.N. Ma S.-W. Morris V.L. Cuppels D.A. Can. J. Microbiol. 1989; 35: 910-917Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a pathogen of A. thaliana and an innocuous microbe to M. sativa, and S. meliloti Rm1021 (36Meade H.M. Long S.R. Ruvkun G.B. Brown S.E. Ausubel F.M. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an N2-fixing symbiont of M. sativa that is neither beneficial nor pathogenic to A. thaliana. The bacteria P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and S. meliloti strain Rm1021 were grown overnight in LB liquid medium with 50 μg/ml rifampicin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, respectively, and then the overnight cultures were mixed with Murashige-Skoog liquid medium separately to a final A600 of 0.02. The proteins secreted after 6, 12, and 24 h from the bacteria in Murashige-Skoog medium were used as a control. The plants were washed three times with sterile distilled water and then transferred to fresh Murashige-Skoog medium previously inoculated with the bacteria having a final A600 of 0.02, as described above. The roots of each type of plant were inoculated separately with the bacteria, and after 6, 12, and 24 h, the root exudates of 60 plants (grown separately) were collected and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove root debris and the microorganisms. The supernatant was filtered through a nylon syringe filter of pore size 0.22 μm (catalog number PN 4612, Pall Life Sciences (East Hill, NY); or catalog number 195-2520, Nalagene (Rochester, NY)), and the filtration was concentrated to 500 μl by passing through Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cut-off 5000; Millipore) to separate the secondary metabolites from the proteins and to remove the salts. Secreted proteins were stored at –80 °C until use. For each type of plant and treatment, three biological repetitions (n = 3; 180 plants in total) were used, and each experiment was repeated three times. The same volume of Murashige-Skoog medium used for plants alone was used also for bacteria alone. The protein concentrations of the samples were determined as described by Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar), using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), and bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis Separations—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to separate (38O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantify the proteins secreted in the exudates of roots interacting with bacteria. The proteins in the root exudates of A. thaliana alone, A. thaliana inoculated with P. syringae DC3000, A. thaliana inoculated with S. meliloti, M. sativa alone, M. sativa inoculated with P. syringae DC3000, M. sativa inoculated with S. meliloti, P. syringae DC3000 alone, and S. meliloti alone were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis following 6, 12, and 24 h. One hundred fifty micrograms of total exuded protein for each time point/treatment were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis following the protocol described by Lei et al. (39Lei Z. Elmer A.M. Watson B.S. Dixon R.A. Mendes P.J. Sumner L.W. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1812-1825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, the exuded proteins were precipitated using 12.5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid plus 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at –20 °C for 45 min. Immobilized pH gradient strips (Immobiline™ Dry Strips, 24 cm, pH 3–10 nonlinear; Amersham Biosciences) were rehydrated for 12 h at 20 °C with 150 μg of protein in 450 μl of two-dimensional electrophoresis solubilization buffer consisting of 9 m urea, 3% (w/v) CHAPS, 4The abbreviations used are: CHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMSmass spectrometryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyAt-PsA. thaliana inoculated with P. syringae DC3000At-SmA. thaliana inoculated with S. melilotiMs-PsM. sativa inoculated with P. syringae DC3000Ms-SmM. sativa inoculated with S. meliloti. 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% ampholytes. Isoelectric focusing of proteins was performed using the following stepped gradient: 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, and 8000 V until a total of 50,000 V-h had been achieved. After focusing, the immobilized pH gradient gel strips were incubated for 10 min in equilibration buffer (6 m urea, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, and traces of bromphenol blue) containing 2% dithiothreitol followed by a 10-min incubation with equilibration buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide. After equilibration, the immobilized pH gradient strips were placed on the top of a resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5% T, 1 mm thick) and electrophoresed at 110 mA overnight at 10 °C. Separated proteins were visualized using silver staining (40Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3736) Google Scholar), and resultant gels were digitally imaged with a Bio-Rad FluorS equipped with a 12-bit camera. Protein spot detection, quantification, background subtraction, and comparative analyses were performed using Phoretix 2D Expression software (version 2005; Nonlinear Dymanics, Durham, NC) from three different replicate gels. A spot volume was calculated, and each spot was assigned a normalized spot volume as a relative portion of the total value prior to analysis by analysis of variance. Each individual protein spot was then matched with the identical protein spot from each replicate gel. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid mass spectrometry high pressure liquid chromatography A. thaliana inoculated with P. syringae DC3000 A. thaliana inoculated with S. meliloti M. sativa inoculated with P. syringae DC3000 M. sativa inoculated with S. meliloti. In-gel Trypsin Digestion—To identify the proteins resolved in gel that changed during the interactions between plants and microbes, the protein spots were excised and separately digested with trypsin and analyzed by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. Briefly, silver-visualized protein spots were manually excised from the gels. These gel plugs were transferred to polypropylene 96-well plates for further processing. We followed the protocol described by Sumner et al. (41Sumner L.W. Wolf-Sumner B. White S.P. Asirvatham V.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 16: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for removal of silver stain. Then the gel spots were dehydrated with 25 μl of acetonitrile for 15 min at room temperature. After acetonitrile removal, the gel spots were dried under vacuum and rehydrated in 20 μl of sequencing grade modified bovine trypsin (10 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium biocarbonate; Roche Applied Science). After rehydration for 30 min on ice, excess trypsin solution was removed, and 15 μl of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to each well to prevent dehydration during incubation. Proteolysis was allowed to continue for 13 h at 37 °C and stopped by adding 15 μl of 10% formic acid. All peptide extract fractions were pooled, concentrated until dry, and resuspended in a 50:50 (v/v) water-acetonitrile solution containing a final concentration of 0.1% formic acid. Liquid Chromatography/MS/MS—Separations of the protein digests were achieved using a nanoscale HPLC system (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA) consisting of an autosampler (Famos), a precolumn switching device (Switchos), and an HPLC pump system (Ultimate). Samples (5 μl) were loaded onto a C18 precolumn (0.3-mm inner diameter × 1.0 mm, 100 Å, PepMap C18; LC Packings) for desalting and concentrating at a flow rate of 50 μl/min using mobile phase A (5% acetonitrile and 95% water containing 0.1% formic acid). The desalted peptides were then eluted from the precolumn and separated on a nano analytical column C18 column (75-μm inner diameter × 15 cm, 100 Å, PepMap C18; LC Packings) at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of 5–40% mobile phase B (95% acetonitrile and 5% water containing 0.08% formic acid) over 40 min. The separated peptides were directly analyzed with an ABI QSTAR Pulsar I hybrid Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied BioSystems) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ionization source (Protana). The nanoelectrospray was generated using a PicoTip needle (10-μm inner diameter, New Objectives, Woburn, MA) maintained at a voltage of 2400 V. Time-of-flight MS and tandem mass spectral data were acquired using information-dependent acquisition with the following settings: charge state selection from 2 to 5, an intensity threshold of 10 counts/s for tandem experiments, and a collision energy setting automatically determined by the information-dependent acquisition based on the m/z values of each precursor ion. Following information-dependent acquisition, precursor ions were excluded for 90 s using a window of 6 atomic mass units to minimize the redundancy in tandem mass spectra. Data Base Queries and Protein Identification—For protein identification, the acquired mass spectral data were queried against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base (NCBInr), downloaded on February 2007, using the MASCOT (version 2.2, Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) search engine (42Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6732) Google Scholar, 43Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1426-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) with the following settings: a mass tolerance of 100 ppm, one trypsin miscleavage allowance, and two variable amino acid modifications (i.e. methionine oxidation and cysteine carbamidomethylation). Only protein identifications with a molecular weight search score greater than the generally accepted significant threshold (determined at 95% confidence level as calculated by MASCOT; p < 0.05) and at least two matched peptides are reported in this study. The NCBInr also provides the origin of the protein by which we could differentiate proteins of plant origin from those of microorganism origin. Quantification of Protein Secretion and Microbial Growth—Proteins secreted by plants and microbes grown alone and during plant-microbe interactions (Fig. 1A) were quantified. The concentration of secreted proteins from each plant and microbe was very different when it was grown alone compared with the accumulation during plant-microbe interactions. In the case of A. thaliana and M. sativa grown alone, we observed that M. sativa secretes 7.7 times more protein than A. thaliana per plant at 6 h (Fig. 1A). In the case of bacteria alone, we found that S. meliloti secretes 242.95, 203.57, and 132.36 μg of total protein at 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively, whereas P. syringae DC3000 only secretes 2.06, 97.51, and 15.69 μg of total protein over 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. For the interactions, the total secreted proteins at the end of the time course (24 h) increased compared with that secreted when the plants or the microbes were grown alone. For instance, when A. thaliana was inoculated with S. meliloti, the increase of protein secretion was 49% higher after 24 h than when A. thaliana was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000 at the same time point (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the protein exudation at 24 h during the interaction between M. sativa and S. meliloti increased by 41% in comparison with the interaction between M. sativa and P. syringae DC3000 (Fig. 1A). To ascertain that the increase in the secretion of proteins into the media was not due to an increase in the microbial growth during the interactions, we measured the optical density of P. syringae DC3000 and S. meliloti alone and in the presence of plants at 6, 12, and 24 h after inoculation (Fig. 1B). We observed that the two microbes alone grew similarly over time. However, in the case of A. thaliana inoculated with P. syringae DC3000, the growth of the bacteria at 24 h was more than three times higher than S. meliloti grown with A. thaliana, yet we saw more protein secreted in the A. thaliana-S. meliloti interaction (Fig. 1A). The growth of P. syringae DC3000 with M. sativa was more than 5-fold higher than the growth of S. meliloti with M. sativa at 12 and 24 h (Fig. 1B), but again, more protein secretion was observed in the S. meliloti-M. sativa interaction. Therefore, it seems that the accumulation of protein in the interactions is not necessarily due to microbial growth. Proteome Analysis of Root Exudates in Plant-Microbe Interactions—Using a proteomic approach to study the secretions found during each of the interactions and while the organisms were grown alone, we found remarkable differences in the identity of proteins exuded by plants and microbes alone versus during the specific interactions (Tables S1 and S2). Fig. 2 illustrates the protein spots resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis and how those proteins changed in compatible versus incompatible interactions. Although we did the proteomic analysis for each interaction and control at 6, 12, and 24 h, we only show representative images at 6 h for all interactions and independent organisms. Using the control gels from plants and bacteria alone, we were able to corroborate the origin of the identified proteins based upon their NCBInr annotation, represented as PAN in the tables. However, not all of the proteins under PAN were identified from the same organisms used in this study (Tables S3 and S4). We found that in the case of plant proteins (Table S3), there were 10 proteins, of the 72 identified, that are from different plants (not from Arabidopsis or Medicago). These 10 proteins (seven from Medicago sativa list/treatments (spots 1, 2, 8, 12, 13, 15, and 21) and three from A. thaliana list/treatments (spots 32, 37, and 55)) were flagged with an asterisk in Table S1 to facilitate recognition of plant proteins that were identified from different plants. In the same way, listed in Table S2 (bacterial proteins) are 21 proteins (13 from S. meliloti list/treatment (spots 73, 75, 76, 79, 80, 81, 88, 89, 99, and 101–104) and eight from P. syringae DC3000 list/treatment (spots 124–126, 128, and 134–137)) from the 76 identified proteins, which were identified from other bacteria. In the M. sativa-S. meliloti (Ms-Sm) interaction (Fig. 2), secreted proteins above pI 5 clearly decreased in M. sativa inoculated with S. meliloti compared with M. sativa alone (Ms), and the secretion of proteins above 66 kDa by S. meliloti alone (Sm) disappeared in Ms-Sm interaction. When M. sativa was inoculated with P. syringae DC3000 (Ms-Ps), this led to the accumulation of proteins lower than 14 kDa and proteins around pI 5 compared with M. sativa and P. syringae DC3000 alone P. syringae. In the interaction between A. thaliana and S. meliloti (At-Sm), the number of low molecular mass proteins (below 14 kDa) increased after S. meliloti inoculation (Fig. 2) compared with A. thaliana (At) alone and S. meliloti. In the interaction between A. thaliana and P. syringae DC3000 (At-Ps), an increase in nine plant proteins related to defense (four peroxidases (spots 27, 38, 39 and 61), an endo-1,3-β-glucanase (spot 28), a putative secretory protein (spot 41), a β-1,3-glucanase class I precursor (spot 42), and two chitinases (spots 56 and 59); Table S1) was observed compared with A. thaliana alone. Compatible Interactions—Compatible interactions are defined as those that led to the development of a symbiosis (Ms-Sm) or a disease (At-Ps). For a more detailed analysis of how the proteins were secreted over time, we analyzed the quantitative data collected at 6, 12, and 24 h, using the Phoretix 2D Expression software for each interaction and microorganism alone (Tables S1 and S2) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The interaction Ms-Sm caused an increase of at least 1-fold in the secretion of seven proteins from plant origin (spots 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, and 23; Table S1) in two or more time points compared with the plant control. From those seven proteins, three were determined to be from the glycosidase hydrolase family 18 (spots 17–19), one was a pepti"
https://openalex.org/W2042367904,"Heritable variation is the raw material for evolutionary change, and understanding its genetic basis is one of the central problems in modern biology. We investigated the genetic basis of a classic phenotypic dimorphism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Males from many natural isolates deposit a copulatory plug after mating, whereas males from other natural isolates?including the standard wild-type strain (N2 Bristol) that is used in most research laboratories?do not deposit plugs1. The copulatory plug is a gelatinous mass that covers the hermaphrodite vulva, and its deposition decreases the mating success of subsequent males2. We show that the plugging polymorphism results from the insertion of a retrotransposon into an exon of a novel mucin-like gene, plg-1, whose product is a major structural component of the copulatory plug. The gene is expressed in a subset of secretory cells of the male somatic gonad, and its loss has no evident effects beyond the loss of male mate-guarding. Although C. elegans descends from an obligate-outcrossing, male?female ancestor3,4, it occurs primarily as self-fertilizing hermaphrodites5,6,7. The reduced selection on male?male competition associated with the origin of hermaphroditism may have permitted the global spread of a loss-of-function mutation with restricted pleiotropy."
https://openalex.org/W2000241544,"Degradation of the cartilage proteoglycan aggrecan is a key early event in the development of osteoarthritis. Adamalysin with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) -4 and ADAMTS-5 are considered to be the main enzymes responsible for aggrecan breakdown, making them attractive drugs targets. Here we show that calcium pentosan polysulfate (CaPPS), a chemically sulfated xylanopyranose from beechwood, is a multifaceted exosite inhibitor of the aggrecanases and protects cartilage against aggrecan degradation. CaPPS interacts with the noncatalytic spacer domain of ADAMTS-4 and the cysteine-rich domain of ADAMTS-5, blocking activity against their natural substrate aggrecan with inhibitory concentration 50 values of 10-40 nM but only weakly inhibiting hydrolysis of a nonglycosylated recombinant protein substrate. In addition, CaPPS increased cartilage levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3), an endogenous inhibitor of ADAMTS-4 and -5. This was due to the ability of CaPPS to block endocytosis of TIMP-3 mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein. CaPPS also increased the affinity of TIMP-3 for ADAMTS-4 and -5 by more than 100-fold, improving the efficacy of TIMP-3 as an aggrecanase inhibitor. Studies with TIMP-3-null mouse cartilage indicated that CaPPS inhibition of aggrecan degradation is TIMP-3 dependent. These unique properties make CaPPS a prototypic disease-modifying agent for osteoarthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2045786048,"Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Catalytic activity of this enzyme that generates arachidonic acid is a major target for development of anti-inflammatory agents. Independent of its catalytic activity, sPLA2-IIA induces pro-inflammatory signals in a receptor-mediated mechanism (e.g. through the M-type receptor). However, the M-type receptor is species-specific: sPLA2-IIA binds to the M-type receptor in rodents and rabbits, but not in human. Thus sPLA2-IIA receptors in human have not been established. Here we demonstrated that sPLA2-IIA bound to integrin alphavbeta3 at a high affinity (K(D)=2 x 10(-7) M). We identified amino acid residues in sPLA2-IIA (Arg-74 and Arg-100) that are critical for integrin binding using docking simulation and mutagenesis. The integrin-binding site did not include the catalytic center or the M-type receptor-binding site. sPLA2-IIA also bound to alpha4beta1. We showed that sPLA2-IIA competed with VCAM-1 for binding to alpha4beta1, and bound to a site close to those for VCAM-1 and CS-1 in the alpha4 subunit. Wild type and the catalytically inactive H47Q mutant of sPLA2-IIA induced cell proliferation and ERK1/2 activation in monocytic cells, but the integrin binding-defective R74E/R100E mutant did not. This indicates that integrin binding is required, but catalytic activity is not required, for sPLA2-IIA-induced proliferative signaling. These results suggest that integrins alphavbeta3 and alpha4beta1 may serve as receptors for sPLA2-IIA and mediate pro-inflammatory action of sPLA2-IIA, and that integrin-sPLA2-IIA interaction is a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1973941736,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK/Nm23), responsible for intracellular di- and triphosphonucleoside homeostasis, plays multiple roles in cellular energetics, signaling, proliferation, differentiation and tumor invasion. The only human NDPK with a mitochondrial targeting sequence is NDPK-D, the NME4 gene product, which is a peripheral protein of mitochondrial membranes. Subfractionation of rat liver and HEK 293 cell mitochondria revealed that NDPK-D is essentially bound to the inner membrane. Surface plasmon resonance analysis of the interaction using recombinant NDPK-D and model liposomes showed that NDPK-D interacts electrostatically with anionic phospholipids, with highest affinity observed for cardiolipin. Mutation of the central arginine (Arg-90) in a surface-exposed basic RRK motif unique to NDPK-D strongly reduced interaction with anionic phospholipids. Due to its symmetrical hexameric structure, NDPK-D was able to cross-link anionic phospholipid-containing liposomes, suggesting that NDPK-D could promote intermembrane contacts. Latency assays with isolated mitochondria and antibody binding to mitoplasts indicated a dual orientation for NDPK-D. In HeLa cells, stable expression of wild type but not of the R90D mutant led to membrane-bound enzyme in vivo. Respiration was significantly stimulated by the NDPK substrate TDP in mitochondria containing wild-type NDPK-D, but not in those expressing the R90D mutant, which is catalytically equally active. This indicates local ADP regeneration in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and a tight functional coupling of NDPK-D with oxidative phosphorylation that depends on its membrane-bound state."

This work shows that LD biogenesis induced by serum, by long-chain fatty acids, or the combination of both in CHO-K1 cells was prevented by phospholipase A2 inhibitors with a pharmacological profile consistent with the implication of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α). Knocking down cPLA2α expression with short interfering RNA was similar to pharmacological inhibition in terms of enzyme activity and LD biogenesis. A Chinese hamster ovary cell clone stably expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein-cPLA2α fusion protein (EGFP-cPLA2) displayed higher LD occurrence under basal conditions and upon LD induction. Induction of LD took place with concurrent phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser505. Transfection of a S505A mutant cPLA2α showed that phosphorylation at Ser505 is key for enzyme activity and LD formation. cPLA2α contribution to LD biogenesis was not because of the generation of arachidonic acid, nor was it related to neutral lipid synthesis. cPLA2α inhibition in cells induced to form LD resulted in the appearance of tubulo-vesicular profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, compatible with a role of cPLA2α in the formation of nascent LD from the endoplasmic reticulum.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). LD are considered storage organelles for energy generation and membrane-building blocks, although new roles in protein storage and sorting have been proposed recently (4Cermelli S. Guo Y. Gross S.P.

LD are small in most cells (<1 μm), but a single cell may contain hundreds of them, contrasting with the big droplet of adipocytes, the main TAG-storing cells in animals. LD have received increased interest in the last years, fueled by their involvement in the pathogenesis of diseases related to fat storage like obesity, atherosclerosis, and diabetes (6Murphy D.J.

When maintained in serum-deprived conditions, cells are practically devoid of LD, which appear upon addition of complete serum, containing lipoproteins. LD induced by serum increase in number and size when free fatty acids are supplemented at nontoxic concentrations (10Spector A.A. Mathur S.N. Kaduce T.L. Hyman B.T. Prog.

Stress has been shown in many instances to induce LD formation; cells reaching confluence (12Barba I. Mann P. Cabañas M.E. Arús C. Gasparovic C.

In fact, cellular stress detected by means of NMR, where mobile lipids in LD generate specific signals (16Barba I. Cabañas M.E. Arús C.

Sci. 2003; 24: 146-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Over the past years, a number of proteins associated with LD have been characterized. Among them, the best known is the perilipin-adipophilin-TIP47 family of proteins, termed collectively PAT (3Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 20Miura S. Gan J.W. Brzostowski J. Parisi M.J. Schultz C.J. Londos C. Oliver B. Kimmel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32253-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Adipophilin, also called adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), is a constitutive PAT protein, which is degraded in the absence of LD, and therefore expression levels of this protein reflect the mass of stored neutral lipids (21Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike perilipin, which is specific for adipocytes and steroidogenic cells, ADRP is expressed ubiquitously, and it is not involved in hormone action (22Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38486-38493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).A number of additional proteins have been found associated with LD fractions, including lipid-metabolizing enzymes. One of these is acyl-CoA synthetase (23Fujimoto Y. Itabe H. Sakai J. Makita M. Noda J. Mori M. Higashi Y. Kojima S. Takano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 24Liu P. Ying Y. Zhao Y. Mundy D.I. Zhu M. Anderson G.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 46835-46842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this enzyme with triacsin C abolishes the formation of LD in cells undergoing apoptosis (15Iorio E. Di Vito M. Spadaro F. Ramoni C. Lococo E. Carnevale R. Lenti L. Strom R. Podo F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1634: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), underlining the need for TAG synthesis in the genesis of new LD. Phospholipase D1 has also been found associated with LD (26Nakamura N. Banno Y. Tamiya-Koizumi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and was shown to promote LD budding off from microsomes in a cell-free system, in a manner requiring TAG synthesis and an unidentified cytosolic factor (27Marchesan D. Rutberg M. Andersson L. Asp L. Larsson T. Borén J. Johansson B.R. Olofson S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27293-27300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This factor was later identified as ERK2, working apparently downstream of phospholipase D1 to induce dynein association with LD (28Andersson L. Boström P. Ericson J. Rutberg M. Magnusson B. Marchesan D. Ruiz M. Asp L. Huang P. Frohman M.A. Borén J. Olofsson S.O. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), on the other hand, has also been reported associated to LD (29Yu W. Bozza P.T. Tzizik D.M. Gray J.P. Cassara J. Dvorak A.M. Weller P.F. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 759-769PubMed Google Scholar, 30Meadows J.W. Pitzer B. Brockman D.E. Myatt L. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Fatty Acids. 2001; 64: 227-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Key proteins essential for LD generation do not necessarily have to associate with them, however. In this regard, the TAG-synthesizing diacylglycerol-acyltransferase or the cholesteryl ester synthesizing acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), whose activities promote LD generation, are known to reside in the ER (32Cadigan K.M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2201-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 33Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lu X. Lin S. J.

Current models support that nascent LD form in close association with the ER membrane, either between the membrane leaflets (1Martin S. Parton R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 3Wolins N.E. Brasaemle D.L. Bickel P.E. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5484-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) or apposed to the bilayer (35Robenek H. Hofnagel O. Buers I. Robenek M.J. Troyer D. Severs N.J. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Either way, nascent LD should conceivably have a highly curved geometry, and their formation would involve active reorganization of the ER phospholipid composition to allow the formation of amphiphiles favoring this structure. With this working hypothesis, and taking into account that phospholipases A2 participate in many cellular events involving membrane reorganization and traffic (36Brown W.J. Chambers K. Doody A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), in this study we tested the possible implication of these fatty acid and lysophospholipid-generating enzymes in the formation of LD. Phospholipases A2 are a wide group of enzymes that share the capacity to hydrolyze glycerophospholipids at the sn-2 position to generate the corresponding 2-lysophospholipid and a free fatty acid (36Brown W.J. Chambers K. Doody A. Traffic. 2003; 4: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 37Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Cell.

The 15 groups into which PLA2 enzymes have been classified according to nucleotide and amino acid sequence criteria include five distinct types of enzymes, namely the secreted PLA2, the cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2), the Ca2+-independent PLA2, the platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases, and the lysosomal PLA2s (39Schaloske R.H. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 176: 1246-1259Crossref Scopus (720) Google Scholar).Using flow cytometric analysis of Nile red-stained cells as a quantitative approach to monitor the occurrence of LD, we present pharmacological and molecular evidence showing the involvement of group IVA phospholipase A2 (cPLA2α) in the biogenesis of this organelle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]Arachidonic acid ([3H]AA) (200 Ci/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid (49 Ci/mmol) from Amersham Biosciences. PLA2 inhibitors methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP) and bromoenol lactone (BEL) were from Cayman Chemical Co., and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) and pyrrolidine-2 (Py-2, catalog number 525143) were from Calbiochem. Rabbit anti-cPLA2α and anti-phospho-Ser505 cPLA2α antibodies were from Cell Signaling; chicken anti-ADRP was from GenWay Biotech; rabbit anti-GAPDH was from Ambion; mouse anti-BiP/GRP78 and mouse anti-flotillin-1 were from BD Biosciences, and mouse anti-β-actin was from Sigma. Sodium oleate, sodium arachidonate, palmitic acid, tripalmitin, primuline, triacsin C, and Nile red were from Sigma, and 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid (C1-BODIPY® 500/510-C12) was from Molecular Probes.Cells—CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma), containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) or lipoprotein-deficient serum from fetal calf (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cell passages were made once a week by trypsinization (Sigma). When indicated, cells (40–70% confluence) were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid/ml using Lipofectamine Plus™ (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. For stably transfected cells (CHO-cPLA2 and HEK-cPLA2), 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was used for selection and subsequent passages. Other cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. These cell types were human embryo kidney (HEK) cells and HEK cells stably expressing EGFP-cPLA2 (40Casas J. Gijón M.A. Vigo A.G. Sánchez-Crespo M. Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Mol. Biol.

Cells were overlaid with 0.5 ml of PBS, to which 2.5 μl of a stock solution of Nile red in acetone (0.2 mg/ml) was added, so that the final concentrations of Nile red and acetone were 1 μg/ml and 0.5%, respectively. Samples were kept in the dark until photographed in a Leica Qwin 500 microscope with a Leica DC200 camera, using the Leica DCviewer 3.2.0.0 software.Confocal Microscopy—Serum-starved CHO-K1 cells were treated for 6 h with 7.5% FBS and 1 μm C1-BODIPY-C12, either in the absence or presence of MAFP. After two washes with PBS, cells were fixed as outlined above and photographed in a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. To monitor re-location of EGFP-cPLA2, serum-deprived CHO-PLA2 cells were treated with 7.5% FBS for 1 h, and then 5 μm ionomycin was added. Images were acquired every 60 s.Image Analysis—Analysis of LD in photomicrographs was performed with ImageJ 1.38x public software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health; rsb.info.nih.gov), as illustrated in supplemental Fig. S3.Electron Microscopy—Cells were rinsed twice with 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and fixed with PBS containing 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. After four 10-min washes in PBS, cells were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C, washed in PBS, dehydrated through an ascending series of acetone concentrations up to 100%, and included in EPON resin. Micrographs were taken with a JEOL JEM-2011 electron microscope equipped with a CCD GATAN 794 MSC 600HP camera.Flow Cytometry—After each treatment, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After two PBS washes, they were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, to which 5 μl of the stock solution of Nile red was added (final concentration, 1 μg/ml). Samples were kept at least 45 min in the dark to attain equilibrium with the dye. Analysis was carried out with a Cytomics FC 500 (Beckman Coulter) equipped with an argon laser (488 nm), in the FL1 channel (505–545 nm), with the photomultiplier set at 600 V and a gain value of 1. After gating out cellular debris, 30,000 events where taken in all the assays. Given the high avidity of the dye for plastic tubing, and to avoid interference with other flow cytometry applications, a specific pickup tube was used whenever Nile red-stained samples were analyzed.[3H]Arachidonic Release—Serum-starved cells, seeded in 24-well plates, were labeled with 0.25 μCi of [3H]AA (0.5 μCi/ml) for 24 h, then washed once with PBS, incubated for 5 min with Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml albumin, and washed twice more with PBS (41Casas J.

Radioactivity in the last wash was subtracted from released [3H]AA over the stimulation period. Cells were then treated as described in each experiment. At the end of the treatments, culture media were taken, centrifuged, and counted. Cell monolayers were detached with ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and also counted for radioactivity. Stimulated [3H]AA release represents a balance between what has been liberated to the medium and what has been incorporated into the cells.Cellular Fractionation—Harvested cells were washed with PBS and homogenized with a 10-s sonication in 0.6 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged 1 h at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was kept aside, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.6 ml of homogenization buffer. 0.2 ml of each fraction were used for Western blot of marker proteins, and lipids were extracted from the remaining volume.Thin Layer Chromatography—Cells were harvested on ice, washed with 1 ml of PBS, and pelleted for extraction of lipids (43Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). To separate the major lipid species, 0.2-ml aliquots of the chloroform phases were evaporated under vacuum, resuspended in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v), and spotted onto Silica Gel G thin layer chromatography plates (Merck), which were developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70: 30:1, v/v), and stained with iodine vapor or with primuline spray (5 mg of primuline in 100 ml of acetone/water (80:20, v/v)). Identification of phospholipids, diacylglycerol, cholesterol, free fatty acids, TAG, and cholesteryl esters was made by co-migration with authentic standards. Quantification of radioactive lipids was done by scraping into vials the silica gel from regions corresponding to migration of the standards. Primuline-stained TAG was quantified by densitometry after acquiring images under UV (340 nm) light.Immunoblots—Cells were lysed with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, and around 20 μg of protein were separated by standard 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary (1:1,000) and secondary antibodies (1:5,000) were diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% defatted dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20, with the exception of ADRP antibody, which was blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Membranes were developed using ECL detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences and visualized using a GeneGenome HR chemiluminescence detection system coupled to a CCD camera.Constructs—The construct codifying for the expression of a fusion protein containing N-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) followed by the entire sequence of the human cPLA2α (EGFP-cPLA2) was described elsewhere (40Casas J.

To obtain the construct for EGFP-S505A-cPLA2, wild-type cPLA2 was mutagenized by replacing Ser505 with Ala, using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotides 5′-CAA TAC ATC TTA TCC ACT GGC GCC TTT GAG TGA CTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA AAG TCA CTC AAA GGC GCC AGT GGA TAA GAT GTA-3′ (reverse). Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing.siRNA Transfection—Two pre-designed siRNAs (Gene Link) directed against human cPLA2α were used as follows: sense and antisense PLA2G4A2-(2424) (siRNA1), and sense and antisense PLA2G4A1-(1329) (siRNA2). Cells were transfected at 60% confluence by adding to each 35-mm culture well 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 1.5 μl of the stock siRNA solution (20 μm) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine Plus™ (1 mg/ml). After 5 h, 1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 7.5% FBS was added, and the cells were incubated for 48 h and then changed to serum-free medium during 24 h prior to stimulation with FBS. For the assays of cPLA2 activity, prelabeling with [3H]AA was done during these last 24 h. In some experiments, a siRNA directed against human GAPDH (Ambion) was used as control.Calcium Imaging—Cells grown onto polylysine-coated coverslips were incubated with the calcium indicator Fura-2/AM at 4 μm in Krebs buffer of the following composition (in mm): 119 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.18 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 20 Hepes, and 5 glucose, pH 7.4. After 1 h, cells were washed and coverslips mounted in a static chamber on an inverted Nikon TE2000U microscope of a conventional epifluorescence system. Cells were excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm, and emission light was collected at 510 nm every 10 s using a 12 bit-CCD ERG ORCA Hamamatsu camera. Ratio image of cells was analyzed using the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging). 14–20 cells were analyzed in each experiment.Statistical Analysis—Data analysis was carried out with Prism software (GraphPad). Responses among different treatments were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test.RESULTSFlow Cytometry as a Tool to Quantify LD—Our aim was to study LD dynamics under regular culture conditions, avoiding whenever possible the induction of cellular stress, which has been shown to induce the formation of LD. It has long been known that cells accumulate LD from serum lipoproteins (10Spector A.A. Mathur S.N. Kaduce T.L. Hyman B.T. Prog. Lipid Res. 1980; 19: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and therefore our first goal was to set an experimental system with the highest variation in LD content among quiescent, serum-starved cells and cells treated with FBS. For this purpose, we examined various cell models for the occurrence of LD, which we labeled with the lipophilic dye Nile red. To quantify this, we monitored initially the percentage of cells containing two or more LD (13Quintero M.R. Cabañas M.E. Arús C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) at various days after plating in serum-containing medium and after serum withdrawal (supplemental Fig. S1). Using this criterion, 100% CHO-K1 cells cultured in FBS-containing medium were LD-positive from day 1 onward. Serum deprivation at day 2 reduced LD-containing cells after 24 h to only 10–15%. HeLa cells and primary astrocytes also reduced LD content after serum deprivation but to a lesser extent. We therefore decided to explore deeper the mechanisms of LD formation when serum-deprived CHO-K1 cells were challenged with 7.5% FBS.The criterion to consider LD-positive every cell containing two or more LD may be convenient as a first approach, but it does not discriminate cells containing more than two droplets or cells containing LD of different sizes. This is the case when comparing LD content in cells treated with FBS in the presence or absence of 100 μm sodium oleate, as shown in Fig. 1. Serum-deprived cells were virtually devoid of LD (Fig. 1A), whereas a 6-h treatment with 7.5% FBS induced LD in most cells (Fig. 1B). The same is true when LD formation was induced with FBS together with an overload of exogenous sodium oleate (Fig. 1C). However, the overall occurrence of LD was higher with the latter treatment, as evidenced by simple visual inspection or by the level of expression of ADRP (Fig. 1D). These two conditions were discriminated after image analysis of the photomicrographs (Fig. 1E; see also supplement Fig. S2) or after indirect quantification with cell cytometry (Fig. 1, F and G). Compared with serum-starved cells, the right shifts of the fluorescence profiles, shown in Fig. 1F, indicate a stronger signal in the presence of oleate than in its absence, and this can be quantified after the median value of each distribution of events (Fig. 1G). LD induction by both treatments was abolished in the presence of the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor triacsin C, as evidenced by microscopic examination (not shown) and the left shift of the fluorescence distributions (Fig. 1, H and I), which were similar to those from serum-starved cells. Furthermore, the time course of LD formation after addition of FBS was easily monitored by flow cytometry, with an increase in the fluorescent signal up to 16 h (supplemental Fig. S3, A and D). Oleate in the presence of FBS induced a faster increase of the Nile red-associated fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S3, B and D). As expected, treatment with lipoprotein-deficient serum did not induce LD, quantified either by microscopic examination (not shown) or by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D). Overall, the remarkable reproducibility of the data and the high number of cells that can be analyzed in a single f"

We used synphilin 1, a protein implicated in Parkinson disease, as a model to study mechanisms of aggresome formation. When expressed in naïve HEK293 cells, synphilin 1 forms multiple small highly mobile aggregates. However, proteasome or Hsp90 inhibition rapidly triggered their translocation into the aggresome, and surprisingly, this response was independent on the expression level of synphilin 1. Therefore, aggresome formation, but not aggregation of synphilin 1, represents a special cellular response to a failure of the proteasome/chaperone machinery. Importantly, translocation to aggresomes required a special aggresome-targeting signal within the sequence of synphilin 1, an ankyrin-like repeat domain. On the other hand, formation of multiple small aggregates required an entirely different segment within synphilin 1, indicating that aggregation and aggresome formation determinants can be separated genetically. Furthermore, substitution of the ankyrin-like repeat in synphilin 1 with an aggresome-targeting signal from huntingtin was sufficient for aggresome formation upon inhibition of the proteasome. Analogously, attachment of the ankyrin-like repeat to a huntingtin fragment lacking its aggresome-targeting signal promoted its transport to aggresomes. These findings indicate the existence of transferable signals that target aggregation-prone polypeptides to aggresomes.

Molecular chaperones and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 2The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; si-HSF1, small interfering HSF1; UPR, unfolded protein response. play an important role in handling soluble abnormal polypeptides that could arise as a result of misfolding, damage, or mutations (1Luo G.R. Chen S. Le W.D. Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2007; 3: 20-26Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, under certain conditions these systems fail to repair or destroy abnormal species, leading to formation of small cytoplasmic aggregates. These aggregates can cause cell toxicity leading to various pathologies, including major neurodegenerative disorders (2Meriin A.B. Sherman M.Y. Int. J. Hyperthermia. 2005; 21: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Recently, it was discovered that special machinery has evolved in cells that transport small protein aggregates in a microtubules-dependent manner to the centrosome, forming an organelle called aggresome (3Corboy M.J. Thomas P.J. Wigley W.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 305-327PubMed Google Scholar–5Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Rubinsztein D.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The aggresome serves as a storage compartment for protein aggregates and could be actively involved in their refolding and degradation. In fact, major chaperones, like Hsp70 or Hsp27, and components of UPS are recruited to aggresome (6Junn E. Lee S.S. Suhr U.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recently it was demonstrated that autophagic clearance of protein aggregates also associates with aggresome (7Garcia-Mata R. Gao Y.S. Sztul E. Traffic. 2002; 3: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).2The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; si-HSF1, small interfering HSF1; UPR, unfolded protein response.There is a notion in the field that aggresome represents a protective cellular response to a buildup of aggregating abnormal polypeptides under the conditions when chaperones and UPS machineries fail to handle abnormal species (8Olzmann J.A. Li L. Chin L.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2008; 15: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 9Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Lee G. Junn E. Iwatsubo T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4625-4631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Indeed, it was reported that there is a close correlation between aggresome formation and cell survival (10Taylor J.P. Tanaka F. Robitschek J. Sandoval C.M. Taye A. Markovic-Plese S. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Furthermore, toxicity of abnormal proteins is strongly enhanced by inhibition of the microtubules-dependent transport, which is required for aggresome formation (5Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Rubinsztein D.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In line with this concept, aggresomes are usually seen in mammalian cells after inhibition of the proteasome (11Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 12Bandopadhyay R. Kingsbury A.E. Muqit M.M. Harvey K. Reid A.R. Kilford L. Engelender S. Schlossmacher M.G. Wood N.W. Latchman D.S. Harvey R.J. Lees A.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Kovacs I. Lentini K.M. Ingano L.M. Kovacs D.M. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Beside aggresome formation, other protein aggregation pathways also appear to exist in mammalian cells. For example, mutant glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressed in cells seems to be unable to form aggresomes and usually forms small multiple aggregates all around the cytoplasm (14Quinlan R.A. Brenner M. Goldman J.E. Messing A. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2077-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the aggresome response, it is critical to use clear mechanistic criteria of aggresomes, including the microtubule dependence of its formation and co-localization with the centrosome.Recently, a number of factors were implicated in aggresome formation. For example, a microtubule-associated histone deacetylase HDAC6 was shown to interact with aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins via its ubiquitin binding BUZ domain and facilitate their association with the dynein motor protein that drives this cargo to the aggresome (15Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Other ubiquitin-binding proteins like PLIC or ataxin 3 play a role in aggresome targeting of several abnormal proteins (16Heir R. Ablasou C. Dumontier E. Elliott M. Fagotto-Kaufmann C. Bedford F.K. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Burnett B.G. Pittman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Marx F.P. Soehn A.S. Berg D. Melle C. Schiesling C. Lang M. Kautzmann S. Strauss K.M. Franck T. Engelender S. Pahnke J. Dawson S. von Eggeling F. Schulz J.B. Riess O. Kruger R. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1759-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a close connection between ubiquitination of abnormal polypeptides and their accumulation in the aggresome. A possible model is that factors with ubiquitin binding domains recognize small aggregates of ubiquitinated abnormal proteins and facilitate their association with dynein, which in turn promotes their transport to the centrosome. However, at present it is not clear whether ubiquitination of abnormal proteins is an essential prerequisite of aggresome formation. In fact, it was demonstrated that aggresome formation by a model polypeptide 250-GFP does not involve ubiquitination (19Garcia-Mata R. Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Sztul E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).Although several factors were implicated in the aggresome formation, basic molecular mechanisms of this process are poorly understood. One of the problems is that in many studies of protein aggregation no clear distinction is made between aggresome and other types of aggregates. For example, a p62/sequestosome protein that binds a non-canonical K63 ubiquitin chain was reported to play a role in aggregation of several substrates (20Donaldson K.M. Li W. Ching K.A. Batalov S. Tsai C.C. Joazeiro C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8892-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Lim K.L. Chew K.C. Tan J.M. Wang C. Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Tanaka Y. Smith W. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), but it remains unclear how this aggregation relates to the aggresome formation. In other words, it is not apparent whether the aggregate is formed in the centrosome and in a microtubules-dependent fashion. These clear criteria distinguishing an aggresome from other types of inclusion bodies are essential from the mechanistic point of view.A hallmark of Parkinson disease is the appearance of protein aggregates called Lewy bodies in affected dopaminergic neurons. Lewy bodies have a lot of similarities with aggresomes and probably represent the same paradigm (22McNaught K.S. Shashidharan P. Perl D.P. Jenner P. Olanow C.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2002; 16: 2136-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 23Olanow C.W. Perl D.P. DeMartino G.N. McNaught K.S. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 496-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The major component of Lewy bodies is α-synuclein (24Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (5975) Google Scholar, 25Wakabayashi K. Tanji K. Mori F. Takahashi H. Neuropathology. 2007; 27: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the recently discovered synphilin 1 associates with α-synuclein and is necessary for its targeting to Lewy body-like protein aggregates in cell culture (26Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Another player in formation of Lewy bodies appears to be the ubiquitin ligase, parkin (6Junn E. Lee S.S. Suhr U.T. Mouradian M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47870-47877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which is also implicated in certain juvenile forms of Parkinson disease (27von Coelln R. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Cell Tissue Res. 2004; 318: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In fact, in parkinsonism caused by defects in parkin, no Lewy bodies could be formed despite severe symptoms. In cell culture it was demonstrated that parkin can ubiquitinate synphilin 1 in an unusual manner, forming a K63 ubiquitin chain, which promotes aggregation of synphilin 1 (21Lim K.L. Chew K.C. Tan J.M. Wang C. Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Tanaka Y. Smith W. Engelender S. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2002-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 28Olzmann J.A. Chin L.S. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, distinction between aggresome and other aggregates has not been done in that work.Recently, we established a yeast model to study the mechanisms of aggresome formation and identified several novel cellular components of the aggresome machinery, including the 14-3-3 protein Bmh1, the chaperone Cdc48 (VCP/p97), and its cofactors Ufd1 and Nlp4. An important mechanistic insight into the aggresome machinery was the discovery that aggresome targeting of an aggregation-prone huntingtin fragment with expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domain is strongly facilitated by the proline-rich region of this protein, which serves as a special aggresome-targeting signal. 3Wang, Y., Meriin, A. B., Zaarur, N., Romanova, N. V., Chernoff, Y. O., Costello, C. E., Sherman, M. Y., submitted for publication. 3Wang, Y., Meriin, A. B., Zaarur, N., Romanova, N. V., Chernoff, Y. O., Costello, C. E., Sherman, M. Y., submitted for publication. This was the first report where the aggregation domain in a polypeptide (expanded polyQ) could be dissected from the aggresome-targeting signal (proline-rich domain, P-region). Furthermore, in co-expression experiments we demonstrated that a soluble protein consisting of short polyQ and the P-region (25QP) upon forming mixed aggregates with a long polyQ polypeptide lacking the P-region (103Q) can dramatically increase aggresome targeting. Therefore, a novel paradigm has emerged from this study that special transferable aggresome-targeting signals in substrate proteins could be necessary for aggresome formation.Here, we addressed whether this paradigm has a general significance by investigating the aggresome-targeting signal in synphilin 1. In the course of this study, we demonstrate that aggresome formation is a special response to proteasome inhibition, which also can be triggered by Hsp90 inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—MG132, Radicicol, nocodazole, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG), and tunicamycin were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), actinomycin D was from Invitrogen, and emetine was from Sigma, UBEI-41 was from BioGenova (Ellicott City, MD). Antibodies against HSP72 and HSF1 were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria British Columbia, Canada), against GFP (rabbit) was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and against γ-tubulin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Constructs—pEGFPN1 plasmid with cloned human synphilin 1 was a gift of Dr. Mark Cookson (NIA, National Institutes of Health). For expression in the retroviral system, the gene of C-terminal-tagged synphilin 1 was subcloned into pCXbsr vector, a gift of Dr. T. Akagi (Osaka Bioscience Institute, Japan). Deletion derivates of synphilin 1 were obtained by subcloning of the PCR-generated truncated sequences into pEGFPN1. The construct ANK1-CC-ANK2-CT encompasses 349–919 amino acids, ANK1-CC-ANK2 encompasses 349–729 amino acids, ANK1-CC encompasses 349–561 amino acids, CC-ANK2-CT encompasses 505–919 amino acids, NT-ANK1 encompasses 1–505 amino acids, ANK2-CT encompasses 561–919 amino acids, and CT encompasses 729–919 amino acids.The GFP-tagged constructs 103Q and 25QP were described previously (29Meriin A.B. Mabuchi K. Gabai V.L. Yaglom J.A. Kazantsev A. Sherman M.Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To construct 25QP-CC-ANK2, 25Q-CC-ANK2, and P-CC-ANK2, we subcloned upstream of CC-ANK2 PCR-generated (using 25QP as a template) sequences encompassing either full huntingtin exon1 (with 25 glutamine residues) or the stretch upstream the proline-rich domain or only the proline-rich domain, respectively. ANK1-CC-103Q was constructed by subcloning of the PCR-generated sequence encoding ANK1-CC upstream of 103Q. To construct Ub-GV-GFP, we subcloned a PCR-generated ubiquitin with G76V substitution into the pQCXIP (Clontech) retroviral vector. The retroviral system expressing si-HSF1 was described previously (30Zaarur N. Gabai V.L. Porco Jr., J.A. Calderwood S. Sherman M.Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Cells Cultures, Transfection, Infection, and Treatments—HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum) and MCF10A (human breast epithelial) cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 50/50 medium supplemented with 5% horse serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, both supplemented with l-glutamine at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions.For production of retroviruses, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a retroviral plasmid and the helper plasmids expressing retroviral proteins Gag-Pol, G vesicular stamatitis virus glygoprotein (VSVG pseudotype). Supernatants containing retrovirus were collected 48 h after transfection. HEK293 and MCF10A cells were infected overnight with supernatant in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene, and selection with blasticidin was started 48 h after infection.Routinely, a treatment of transfected cells started 24 h after transfection. Unless specified otherwise, incubations with MG132 and/or nocodazole were done for 6 h, and the concentration of either inhibitor was kept at 5 μm.Cell Lysis and Analysis—Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Samples were adjusted to have equal concentrations of total protein and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting. For the differential centrifugation analysis, the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in the loading buffer with 2% SDS in volumes equal to those of the supernatant.Immunostaining—Cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, fixed in 1:1 mixture of acetone-ethanol for 10 min at -20 °C, and washed. The fixed cells were stained with mouse anti-γ-tubulin antibody (1:250) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and stained for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody with Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:500) (Molecular Probes). Stained cells were analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.Microscopy and Aggregates Counting—Fluorescent microscopy was performed at room temperature with an Axiovert 200 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) microscope using ×40 or ×100 objectives and the manufacturer's AxioVision 4 software. Synph-GFP and other GFP-tagged polypeptides were observed through the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. To assess the fraction of cells with either aggresomes or multiple aggregates, the cells with the respective morphology as well as all fluorescent cells were blindly counted in 10 randomly chosen fields to have more than 250 cells in total. Each experiment was repeated three times to assure reproducibility of the results.RESULTSAggregation and Aggresome Formation by Synphilin 1—According to previously established mechanism-based criteria (3Corboy M.J. Thomas P.J. Wigley W.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 305-327PubMed Google Scholar), the aggresome is a large centrosome-localized conglomerate of protein aggregates formed in a microtubule-dependent manner. Here, to investigate mechanisms of aggresome formation, we used synphilin 1 as a model substrate.Synphilin 1 tagged with the green fluorescent protein GFP (synph-GFP) was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. 24 h after transfection, about 50% of transfected cells formed multiple small aggregates (Fig. 1A), whereas in the rest of the cells synph-GFP remained soluble. Differential centrifugation confirmed that a fraction of synph-GFP forms Triton X-100-resistant aggregates (Fig. 1B). Using time-lapse microscopy, we observed that the aggregates were highly mobile (supplemental movie Fig. S1). Their mobility was apparently stochastic, and sometimes events of fusion of aggregates or breaking apart were detectable (see the movie, Fig. S1). The movement of the small synph-GFP aggregates was insensitive to microtubule poisons nocodazole or benomyl and never led to formation of a single body co-localized with the centrosome (Fig. 1C, upper panel).Very importantly, inhibition of proteasome led to a dramatic change in the aggregation pattern of synph-GFP. Indeed, incubation with 5 μm proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 6 h led to disappearance of multiple small aggregates and formation of a single large synph-GFP aggregate in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1A). Noteworthy, the effect of MG132 was seen at concentrations as low as 0.5 μm. A similar effect was seen upon incubation of cells with another proteasome inhibitor, Velcade (not shown). Interestingly, with certain other cell lines, e.g. MCF10A (see below), aggresomes appeared within only 2 h upon the addition of a proteasome inhibitor. Of note, GFP alone expressed from the same vector showed diffused pattern, and MG132 didn't cause its aggregation (Fig. S2).Immunostaining with an antibody against a centrosome component, γ-tubulin, demonstrated that the single large aggregate of synph-GFP co-localized with the centrosome (Fig. 1C, lower panel), whereas aggregates in untreated cells did not show co-localization (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Moreover, formation of this aggregate was blocked by the microtubule poisons nocodazole or benomyl, resulting in accumulation of multiple aggregates (Fig. 1, A and D). Therefore, the single synph-GFP aggregate formed in the presence of proteasome inhibitors represented bona fide aggresome. These data clearly indicate that inhibition of the proteasome leads to the switch of the aggregation patterns of synph-GFP from multiple small aggregates to aggresomes.The emergence of multiple aggregates was dependent on the cellular levels of synph-GFP (in contrast to aggresome formation, which was independent on the levels of synph-GFP, as discussed below). Indeed, in cells with low levels of synph-GFP (e.g. achieved by retrovirus-based expression) multiple aggregates were formed only in a minor fraction of the population (less than 5%, compared with almost 50% at higher expression levels), whereas in the rest of the cells synph-GFP remained soluble. To understand the relations between multiple aggregates and aggresome, we monitored the kinetics of aggresome formation after the addition of MG132 to cells expressing low levels of synph-GFP. After 2 h of incubation with the proteasome inhibitor, we observed an increase in the fraction of cells with multiple aggregates and appearance of rare cells with aggresomes (Fig. 1D). By the end of the fourth hour, the fraction of cells with multiple aggregates dropped to almost zero, whereas the fraction of cells with aggresomes increased dramatically. Therefore, it appears that multiple aggregates represent an intermediate step in aggresome formation which can proceed further only upon inhibition of the proteasome.A possible mechanism for the effect of proteasome inhibitors on aggresome formation would be that MG132 stabilizes synph-GFP, leading to its accumulation and stronger aggregation. However, incubation with MG132 for 6 h caused little increase in their levels (Fig. 2A), although efficient aggresome formation was observed at this time. Of note, overexposure of this immunoblot (to allow detection of minor bands) did not reveal any forms of synphilin 1 with molecular weights higher than the major form (Fig. S3), which indicated that little, if any, ubiquitination of synphilin 1 occurs in this system. To carefully assess whether aggresome formation by synph-GFP depends on its cellular levels, we titrated down the amounts of the synph-GFP-encoding plasmid used in transfection of HEK293 cells, which resulted in the wide range (over 20-fold difference) of synph-GFP expression levels (Fig. 2B). In none of these samples were the aggresomes seen without treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, whereas incubation with MG132 led to robust aggresome formation in all the samples (Fig. 2B). Moreover, expression of this construct placed in a retroviral system resulted in dramatically lower levels of synph-GFP (see bellow), making them undetectable by immunoblotting, but upon treatment with MG132 we observed a strong aggresome formation (Fig. 2B, the lower synph-GFP level point). Therefore, triggering of aggresome formation by inhibition of proteasome is unrelated to the increase in expression levels of synph-GFP.FIGURE 2.Aggresome formation is independent on synph-GFP levels. A, levels of synph-GFP in cells incubated with or without MG132 were assayed by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. B, HEK293 cells were transfected with various amounts of synph-GFP plasmid and incubated with or without MG132. The sample with the lowest level of synph-GFP represents retroviral expression. Expression levels with different concentrations of plasmid or retroviral expression (RV) are shown below the graph. Cells with an aggresome, multiple aggregates, or soluble synph-GFP were counted. The levels of synph-GFP in these cells were quantified by immunoblotting and Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. The error bars on the graph represent S.D. C, HEK293 cells were infected with retrovirus encoding an unstable reporter protein Ub-GV-GFP and incubated with or without 20 μm UBEI-41 for 16 h followed by the addition of 5 μm MG132 for 6 h. The levels of the Ub-GV-GFP were monitored by immunoblotting. D, fluorescent micrographs of HEK293 cells infected with the retrovirus encoding synph-GFP and treated with UBEI-41 with or without of MG132. The experimental conditions were as in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Does suppression of the UPS by inhibiting ubiquitination similarly triggers aggresome formation? To address this question, we utilized a recently developed inhibitor of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, UBEI-41, that blocks proteasome-dependent degradation (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6794) Google Scholar). Overnight incubation with 20 μm UBEI-41 of HEK293 cells expressing the short-lived reporter polypeptide Ub-GV-GFP led to a strong stabilization and accumulation of this polypeptide, as was seen with MG132 (Fig. 2C). Similarly, UBEI-41 stabilized short-lived synph-GFP deletion constructs used in experiments described in Table 1 (not shown). However, in contrast to incubation with MG132, no changes in aggregation pattern of synph-GFP were detected upon incubation with UBEI-41, and this polypeptide remained in multiple aggregates (Fig. 2D). It is noteworthy that adding MG132 even after the overnight incubation with UBEI-41 and incubation with both agents for an additional 6 h led to efficient aggresome formation (Fig. 2D), suggesting that aggresome formation is specifically triggered by proteasome inhibition.Inhibition of Hsp90 Also Triggers the Aggresome Response— Inhibition of proteasome induces transcription of a number of genes, including the heat shock protein genes (32Yew E.H. Cheung N.S. Choy M.S. Qi R.Z. Lee A.Y. Peng Z.F. Melendez A.J. Manikandan J. Koay E.S. Chiu L.L. Ng W.L. Whiteman M. Kandiah J. Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 943-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of the aggresome formation could be a part of the heat shock response. To address this possibility, we tested whether other activators of the heat shock response, like elevated temperature or inhibitors of Hsp90, can trigger formation of aggresomes by synph-GFP. In these experiments, we utilized MCF10A cells that expressed synph-GFP in a retroviral system, which accounted for very low levels of this polypeptide. Under these conditions, synph-GFP did not form detectable multiple aggregates, greatly enhancing the sensitivity of detection of the aggresomes. Of note, untreated MCF10A cells did not show aggresomes, whereas the addition of MG132 or Velcade led to formation of aggresomes in almost 100% of cells within 2 h in a nocodazole-sensitive manner (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3.Effects of inhibitors of transcription, translation, or HSP90 on aggresome formation. A, fluorescent micrographs (fluorescein isothiocyanate channel) of MCF10A cells infected with synph-GFP-encoding retrovirus were treated for 6 h with the indicated inhibitors. Radicicol was used at 5 μm, 17-AAG was at 0.5 μm, emetine was at 10 μm, and actinomycin was at 5 μg/ml. To deplete HSF1, cells were co-infected with si-HSF1 retrovirus. The arrows show aggresomes.

For fast-growing cells, this necessitates rapid recycling of DNA polymerase on the lagging strand. Bacteria produce long Okazaki fragments (1-2 kb) and utilize a highly processive DNA polymerase III (pol III), which is held to DNA by a circular sliding clamp. In contrast, Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes are quite short, 100-250 bp, and thus the eukaryotic lagging strand polymerase does not require a high degree of processivity. The lagging strand polymerase in eukaryotes, polymerase δ (pol δ), functions with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp. In this report, Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol δ is examined on model substrates to gain insight into the mechanism of lagging strand replication in eukaryotes. Surprisingly, we find pol δ is highly processive with PCNA, over at least 5 kb, on Replication Protein A (RPA)-coated primed single strand DNA. The high processivity of pol δ observed in this report contrasts with its role in synthesis of short lagging strand fragments, which require it to rapidly dissociate from DNA at the end of each Okazaki fragment. We find that this dilemma is solved by a “collision release” process in which pol δ ejects from PCNA upon extending a DNA template to completion and running into the downstream duplex. The released pol δ transfers to a new primed site, provided the new site contains a PCNA clamp. Additional results indicate that the collision release mechanism is intrinsic to the pol3/pol31 subunits of the pol δ heterotrimer.

During replication fork movement, discontinuous lagging strand fragments are initiated by RNA primers generated by the primase function of DNA polymerase α/primase (pol α/primase), and the primers are extended by DNA pol α to a total length of 30-35 nucleotides. Unlike pol α, pol δ and pol ϵ both utilize PCNA, a ring-shaped sliding clamp that increases the processivity of these DNA polymerases, and the PCNA clamp is assembled onto DNA by the 5-subunit RFC clamp loader (3Yao N. Turner J. Kelman Z. Stukenberg P.T. Dean F. Shechter D. Pan Z.Q. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Burgers P.M. Yoder B.L. J. Biol.

Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). In these respects the eukaryotic replication apparatus is similar to the bacterial replisome, which contains sliding clamps and a clamp loader, except the bacterial replisome utilizes two identical copies of a DNA polymerase (pol III) for the leading and lagging strands (8O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10653-10656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes also contain a heterohexameric MCM 2-7 complex, which is thought to be the replicative helicase, analogous to the Escherichia coli DnaB homohexamer (9Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar).Despite the similarities between bacterial and eukaryotic replisomes, they appear to diverge significantly in many other respects. For example, the bacterial clamp loader is tightly associated with the leading and lagging stand polymerases, whereas the RFC clamp loader lacks stabile interactions with either pol δ or pol ϵ. Furthermore, the eukaryotic replication fork utilizes numerous factors that have no apparent homolog in bacteria, including the GINS complex and Cdc45 protein, among others (10Bauerschmidt C. Pollok S. Kremmer E. Nasheuer H.P. Grosse F. Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 745-758PubMed Google Scholar). Also, RPA, the eukaryotic single strand DNA-binding protein, is a heterotrimer whereas the bacterial SSB is a homotetramer.We have a long term interest in understanding the detailed mechanism by which DNA polymerases act at a replication fork. In this report we focus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol δ and its expected actions on the lagging strand during chromosome replication. Most cells produce 100-1000 Okazaki fragments for each replicative DNA polymerase, and this necessitates efficient recycling of the scarce DNA polymerase. It is particularly fascinating when an enzyme with high processivity functions on the lagging strand, because it must dramatically loosen its tight grip to DNA at the end of each lagging strand fragment to dissociate from DNA and recycle to new primed sites. A clear example of this is the bacterial pol III replicase, which functions with the β sliding clamp to achieve processivity of over 50 kb, yet Okazaki fragments are only 1-2 kb. Recycling of the tightly bound pol III on the lagging strand is solved by a “collision release” mechanism that disengages pol III from the β clamp upon completing a DNA template (11Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The released pol III then rapidly associates with a new β clamp assembled at an upstream RNA primed site. Collision release involves the τ subunit, which facilitates separation of pol III from the clamp upon completing a DNA segment (12Leu F.P. Georgescu R. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 315-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A second type of polymerase recycling mechanism, referred to as “premature release” (also called “signaling release”) occurs when the lagging strand polymerase releases from the clamp prior to finishing an Okazaki fragment. Premature release is the dominant, if not sole, mechanism of polymerase recycling in the T4 phage replication system (13Yang J. Nelson S.W. Benkovic S.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Premature release may be required in the T4 phage system due to production of very short 5-nucleotide RNA primers that would dissociate if they were not immediately extended by polymerase. Primers in E. coli are much longer (∼12 nucleotides) and thus remain on DNA. However, premature release can be observed in the E. coli system when the Okazaki fragment cycle is perturbed or the lagging strand polymerase is stalled (14Li X. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34757-34765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15McInerney P. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21543-21551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Premature release is thought to be signaled by events related to priming or by assembly of clamps on new RNA primers.The current report uses pure recombinant S. cerevisiae replication proteins to study pol δ-PCNA processivity, and to gain insight into the mechanism of polymerase recycling on the lagging strand in eukaryotes. We expected pol δ to lack a high degree of processivity, partly based on previous reports of human pol δ (16Masuda Y. Suzuki M. Piao J. Gu Y. Tsurimoto T. Kamiya K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6904-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Podust V.N. Podust L.M. Muller F. Hubscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5003-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but also based on the small size of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes (18DePamphilis M.L. Wassarman P.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 627-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Bielinsky A.K. Gerbi S.A. Science. 1998; 279: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Instead, we find that yeast pol δ is remarkably processive with PCNA and extends a single primer around an entire 5.4-kb primed φX174 ssDNA genome. Unlike bacterial pol III, the high processivity of pol δ with PCNA does not require specific contact to the RPA ssDNA-binding protein. Instead, pol δ is just as rapid and processive with PCNA when E. coli SSB is used in place of RPA. This result may explain the ability of pol δ to replicate both leading and lagging strands of the SV40 viral genome (20Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 21Weinberg D.H. Collins K.L. Simancek P. Russo A. Wold M.S. Virshup D.M. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The high processivity of pol δ-PCNA also suggests that pol δ may substitute for pol ϵ in cells that lack the N-terminal polymerase domain of pol ϵ, yet remain viable (23Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 24Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar).The high processivity of yeast pol δ with PCNA raises the question of how pol δ rapidly recycles to new primed sites upon completion of each short Okazaki fragment. We examine this issue here and find that the highly processive pol δ-PCNA contains an intrinsic capacity for collision release. Study of the collision release mechanism shows that pol δ does not recognize the 5′ RNA terminus to induce collision release; 5′ DNA is just as efficient. Collision release also does not require RPA, nor does it require the ssDNA binding region of the RFC1 subunit of RFC, a putative functional analogue of the E. coli τ subunit involved in collision release. We also ask if premature release of pol δ can be signaled by stalling pol δ-PCNA in the presence of a primed challenge DNA but find that the stalled pol δ retains its tight grip to PCNA. In addition, the current report demonstrates that the pol32 subunit of pol δ is not required for processivity or collision release. Overall, the study indicates that the unexpected high processivity of pol δ and the collision release mechanism are intrinsic properties of pol δ; additional factors are not required, and the responsibility for these actions is relegated to one or both of the pol3 and pol31 subunits of pol δ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Substrates—M13mp18 single strand circular DNA was prepared as described (25Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). φX174 virion single strand circular DNA was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Unless otherwise noted, sequences of oligonucleotide primers used to initiate synthesis on circular ssDNA were: primer 1B (φX174) 5′-ACCAACATAAACGTTATTGCCCGGCGTACG-3′, primer 3B (M13mp18) 5′-AGTTAAAGGCCGCTTTTGCGGGATCGTCACCC-3′, and the RNA/DNA primer (φX174) 5′-rCrArArGrCrArGrUrArGdTdAdAdTdTdCdCdTdGdCdTdTdTdAdTdCdAdAdG-3′.Genes encoding the three subunits of S. cerevisiae pol δ (pol3, pol31, and pol32) were cloned into separate compatible E. coli expression plasmids under control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter. The POL32 gene was cloned in-frame with an N-terminal GST affinity tag followed by codons for the amino acids LEVLFQGPH and then by the coding sequence of POL32. The italicized residues are recognized by the PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), which cleaves between the adjacent Q and G, leaving three extra amino acid residues at the N terminus of the pol32 protein after proteolytic removal of the GST moiety. The pol3 protein used in these studies has the sequence Glu-Leu at positions 78 and 79, respectively, which differs from the sequence Asp78-Val79 reported in the Saccharomyces Genome Data Base (www.yeastgenome.org), as previously described (26Morrison A. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 375Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).Proteins—To express and purify pol δ, the pol3, pol31, and GST-pol32 plasmids were co-transformed into electrocompetent E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Lucigen, Middleton, WI) by electroporation, and co-transformants were selected at 37 °C on LB agar plates containing ampicillin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. After overnight growth of individual transformants in liquid medium, cultures were diluted into 12 liters of fresh selective medium and grown at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.7, then placed on ice for 30 min, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 15 °C. Induced cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 3 ml of Tris-sucrose (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose), and stored at -80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed, adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× GBB (GST binding buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). Cells were lysed in a cold French Press. After lysis, spermidine was added to 30 mm, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in a Sorvall SLA-1500 rotor. The clarified supernatant (100-150 ml) was applied onto a 7-ml column of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 1× GBB plus 0.5 m NaCl. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5-7 column volumes of 1× GBB buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, then equilibrated with 3 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT) containing 0.3 m NaCl. Protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of elution buffer containing 40 mm reduced l-glutathione, and fractions of 0.3 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Peak fractions (∼4 ml) were pooled, mixed with 40 units of PreScission Protease to remove the GST tag from pol32, and dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 300 mm NaCl. After dialysis and protease cleavage, pooled fractions were diluted with Buffer A to a conductivity equivalent to Buffer A containing 80 mm NaCl and applied at 0.25 ml/min to a 1-ml mono Q column equilibrated with Buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl. The mono Q column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl, and bound protein was eluted with a 20-column volume gradient of Buffer A plus 80 mm NaCl to Buffer A plus 200 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the two-subunit form of pol δ (pol3 and pol31) eluted early from the column and were stored individually at -80 °C. Peak fractions of stoichiometric pol δ heterotrimer were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C (total yield ∼ 0.25 mg).

Chem. 2000; 275: 1421-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were prepared as described.DNA Replication Assays—DNA replication reactions were performed as follows: PCNA (240 fmol, as trimer), RFC (360 fmol, as pentamer), φX174 circular ssDNA (165 fmol, as circles) primed with a DNA 30-mer, either RPA (640 nm, as heterotrimer) or E. coli SSB (65 pmol, as tetramer), and the indicated amount of pol δ (as heterotrimer) were incubated 5 min at 30 °C in 135 μl of Replication Buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 50 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 5% glycerol, and 60 μm each of dGTP and dCTP) unless indicated otherwise in the legends. DNA synthesis was initiated by adding 15 μl of Start Buffer (60 μm dATP, 20 μm dTTP, and 15 μCi of [α-32P]dTTP in Replication Buffer) and incubated at 30 °C (all concentrations are with respect to the final 150-μl reaction). At the indicated times, 25-μl aliquots were removed and quenched by addition of an equal volume of 1% SDS/40 mm EDTA. Total incorporation of [α-32P]dTTP (as dTMP) was determined by spotting a portion of the reaction on DE81 filters. Filters were washed and dried, and total incorporation was analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter. RFII products were analyzed in a 0.8% agarose gel in 1× TBE. Gels were dried, exposed to PhosphorImager screens, and imaged using a Typhoon 9400 Laser scanner (GE Healthcare).For challenge experiments, separate donor and challenge reactions were prepared containing (donor, challenge): primed circular ssDNA (68 fmol φX174, 334 fmol M13mp18), either RPA (40 pmol, 130 pmol), or E. coli SSB (30 pmol, 120 pmol), PCNA (180 fmol, 690 fmol), and RFC (190 fmol, 725 fmol) in Replication Buffer (potassium glutamate was omitted in reactions containing SSB). Donor and challenge reactions were incubated separately for 5 min at 30 °C and then mixed. pol δ (270 fmol) was added either to the donor reaction before pre-incubation or to the combined reaction after mixing as indicated. DNA synthesis was initiated upon adding Start Buffer as described above, either immediately or after co-incubation of the mixed reaction for the indicated times, and then aliquots were quenched at various times after initiation and analyzed as described above.Analysis of Terminal Replication Products—For analysis of the terminal products of replication, the basic replication assay was modified as follows: pol δ (900 fmol), PCNA (408 fmol), RFC (416 fmol), and SSB (68 pmol) were incubated along with singly primed φX174 (175 fmol) and 40 units of XhoI restriction endonuclease in 125 μl of Replication Buffer for 5 min at 30 °C. The primer for these reactions has the sequence 5′-CAAGCAGTAGTAATTCCTGCTTTATCAAG-3′. DNA synthesis was initiated by adding 25 μl of Start Buffer. A parallel reaction (75 μl) using E. coli pol III∗ (275 pmol) and β-clamp (1.1 pmol as dimer) along with singly primed φX174 (87 fmol) and 20 units of XhoI was performed as a control. To confirm cutting by XhoI, 25-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times, quenched, and analyzed as above. For analysis of the terminal products of replication, 12.5-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and quenched by addition of an equal amount of 2× denaturing PAGE loading buffer. Samples were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel. Gels were exposed and analyzed as above. For comparison, a DNA ladder was generated using the 3′-5′ exonuclease minus derivative of Klenow fragment and a 5′-end radiolabeled primer (5′-GAGCTTCTCGAGCTGCGCAAGG-3′) was annealed to φX174 ssDNA in the presence of chain-terminating mixtures of dNTPs/ddNTPs.RESULTSDNA Synthesis by pol δ-PCNA Is Remarkably Processive with PCNA—The studies of this report utilize a recombinant S. cerevisiae pol δ heterotrimer produced in E. coli, which consists of the pol3 polymerase and its two small subunits, pol31 and pol32. The purified recombinant pol δ contains all three subunits in approximately equal molar ratio (Fig. 1A). We have previously expressed recombinant S. cerevisiae RFC and PCNA to high levels in E. coli (28Finkelstein J. Antony E. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The recombinant pol δ shows robust replication activity that depends on both PCNA and RFC (Fig. 1B).In the experiment of Fig. 1C, we examine the processivity of pol δ with PCNA during synthesis. The assay utilizes the 5.4-kb φX174 bacteriophage ssDNA genome primed with an oligonucleotide and coated with RPA. The RFC clamp loader was first used to assemble a PCNA clamp onto the primed site, and then a series of time-course experiments was performed using progressively lower amounts of pol δ and a constant amount of RPA, RFC, PCNA, and DNA (see scheme in Fig. 1C). To visualize DNA products, [α-32P]dTTP was added to the dNTP mixture, and time points were withdrawn and analyzed in a neutral agarose gel.If the action of pol δ-PCNA is not processive for the full length of the 5.4-kb primed template, pol δ will come on and off DNA during extension of the single primer around the full circle. At high concentrations of pol δ, as soon as one pol δ dissociates from PCNA, another will rapidly take its place and resume synthesis of the full-length product. But as pol δ becomes limiting, a new pol δ will not take the place of a pol δ that dissociates. Furthermore, once pol δ dissociates from a partially extended substrate, it does not necessarily reassociate with the same partially replicated substrate. Instead, the dissociated pol δ will sample the multiple primed substrates, and thus will require a longer time to form full-length 5.4-kb duplex RFII product compared with reactions that contain a higher amount of pol δ. The result in Fig. 1D shows that the rate of RFII duplex product formation is the same for all pol δ concentrations, even when pol δ is limiting. Hence, pol δ is fully processive with PCNA on the 5.4-kb substrate and extends the primer full circle in a single DNA-binding event. The time course also shows that the pol δ-PCNA replicase forms 5.4-kb RFII product within 35 s (Fig. 1D), indicating a rate of incorporation of ∼150 nucleotides/s. This result implies that complete extension of a 100- to 250-bp Okazaki fragment requires only 1-2 s.High Processivity of pol δ-PCNA Does Not Require Its Cognate ssDNA-binding Protein—Processivity of pol δ-PCNA during synthesis of an entire 5.4-kb φX174 ssDNA genome is unexpected given the short length of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes. This high degree of processive synthesis is also observed with the E. coli pol III replicase, which functions with the circular β clamp, similar to pol δ with PCNA (31Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli pol III requires its cognate SSB for high processivity and is no longer highly processive when heterologous single-stranded DNA-binding proteins are used to coat the ssDNA, such as human RPA or phage T4 gene 32 protein (32Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the E. coli system, the pol III replicase contains the χ subunit, which binds to SSB and contributes to the processivity of E. coli pol III with its β clamp (32Kelman Z. Yuzhakov A. Andjelkovic J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2436-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23476-23484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Eukaryotes have no apparent sequence homolog of the E. coli χ subunit (34Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and thus may not exhibit a strong requirement for its cognate RPA single strand-binding protein. Although previous studies have shown that pol δ-PCNA can function on E. coli SSB-coated DNA, processivity was not measured (6Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Fig. 2 we test whether pol δ-PCNA requires RPA for processive function by replacing RPA with SSB from E. coli using primed φX174 ssDNA. The results demonstrate that as pol δ is titrated down to limiting amounts in the reaction, full-length 5.4-kb RFII product is still formed at the same rate as at high pol δ concentration. Therefore, pol δ-PCNA does not require its cognate RPA single strand DNA-binding protein for rapid and processive function with PCNA. Furthermore, pol δ-PCNA displays essentially the same rate of elongation on the E. coli SSB-coated ssDNA template as on RPA-coated primed ssDNA (compare Fig. 1D with Fig. 2).FIGURE 2pol δ-PCNA does not require RPA for speed and processivity. A, scheme illustrating reactions performed using E. coli SSB in place of yeast RPA. pol δ-PCNA is assembled on primed φX174 ssDNA coated with E. coli SSB, then dATP, dTTP, and [32P]dTTP are added to initiate synthesis. Time points are collected as indicated in the figure. B, reaction conditions are detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” and DNA products were analyzed in a 0.8% native agarose gel followed by autoradiography. The position of the fully replicated RFII duplex product is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)pol δ Dissociates from DNA Specifically upon Completing DNA—The high processivity of pol δ with PCNA stands in contrast to its action on the lagging strand where pol δ must rapidly dissociate upon finishing an Okazaki fragment so it can transfer to a new primer for extension of the next Okazaki fragment. Rapid transfer to a new primed site requires that pol δ lose its tight grip on DNA upon completing a DNA template.To test whether pol δ loses affinity for DNA upon completing DNA synthesis, we assembled pol δ with PCNA on a donor φX174-primed DNA and added it to a 5-fold excess of primed M13mpl8 challenge DNA. For this experiment, the φX174 template was primed using an oligonucleotide that contains 5′ ribonucleotides to mimic the structure pol δ encounters during normal replication, Okazaki fragments terminated at the 5′ terminus by RNA synthesized by pol α/primase (35Conaway R.C. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4585-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After mixing the two DNAs and initiating DNA synthesis (see scheme in Fig. 3A), time points were withdrawn and analyzed in a native agarose gel. If pol δ and its associated PCNA clamp remain tightly bound to the donor φX174 RFII duplex product, it will not transfer to the challenge DNA, in which case synthesis of M13mp18 7.2 kb RF II will not be observed. On the other hand, if pol δ-PCNA dissociates from φX174 DNA upon completing replication and the polymerase transfers to the M13mp18 challenge DNA along with its clamp, the 7.2-kb M13mp18 RFII product will become visible shortly after the 5.4-kb φX174 RFII product appears. Due to their different sizes, the duplex RFII products of the φX174 and M13mp18 are readily distinguished in a native agarose gel.FIGURE 3Collision release by pol δ enables it to transfer to new primed sites endowed with a PCNA clamp. A, reaction scheme: polδ was assembled with PCNA on the RPA-coated 5.4-kb φX174 donor ssDNA primed with an oligonucleotide containing 5′ ribonucleotides, and then a 5-fold molar excess of M13mp18 challenge primed template was added; the challenge DNA either contained PCNA or lacked PCNA. Replication was initiated immediately after addition of the challenge DNA, and reactions wer"
https://openalex.org/W2123427895,"Congenital hyperinsulinism is a disorder of pancreatic beta-cell function characterized by failure to suppress insulin secretion in the setting of hypoglycemia, resulting in brain damage or death if untreated. Loss-of-function mutations in the K(ATP) channel (composed of two subunits: Kir6.2 and SUR-1) are responsible for the most common and severe form of congenital hyperinsulinism. Most patients are unresponsive to available medical therapy and require palliative pancreatectomy. Similar to the human condition, the SUR-1(-/-) mouse is hypoglycemic when fasted and hyperglycemic when glucose-loaded. We have previously reported that the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonist exendin-(9-39) raises fasting blood glucose in normal mice. Here we examine the effect of exendin-(9-39) on fasting blood glucose in SUR-1(-/-) mice. Mice were randomized to receive exendin-(9-39) or vehicle. Fasting blood glucose levels in SUR-1(-/-) mice treated with exendin-(9-39) were significantly higher than in vehicle-treated mice and not different from wild-type littermates. Exendin-(9-39) did not further worsen glucose tolerance and had no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity. Isolated islet perifusion studies demonstrated that exendin-(9-39) blocked amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion, which is abnormally increased in SUR-1(-/-) islets. Furthermore, cAMP content in SUR-1(-/-) islets was reduced by exendin-(9-39) both basally and when stimulated by amino acids, whereas cytosolic calcium levels were not affected. These findings suggest that cAMP plays a key role in K(ATP)-independent insulin secretion and that the GLP-1 receptor is constitutively active in SUR-1(-/-) beta-cells. Our findings indicate that exendin-(9-39) normalizes fasting hypoglycemia in SUR-1(-/-) mice via a direct effect on insulin secretion, thereby raising exendin-(9-39) as a potential therapeutic agent for K(ATP) hyperinsulinism."
https://openalex.org/W2161760748,"Primary hepatocytes from several different species rapidly lose viability and phenotypic functions on isolation from their native microenvironment of the liver. Stromal cells derived from both within and outside the liver can induce phenotypic functions in primary hepatocytes in vitro; however, the molecular mediators underlying this ""coculture effect"" have not been fully elucidated. We have previously developed a functional genomic screen utilizing cocultures of hepatocytes and 3T3 fibroblasts to identify such candidate hepatocyte-function-inducing molecules. In particular, truncated-cadherin (T-cadherin) was identified as a potential molecule of interest in induction of hepatic functions. Here we demonstrate that liver-specific functions of primary rat hepatocytes are induced on cocultivation with Chinese hamster ovary cells engineered to express T-cadherin on their surface as compared with wild-type controls. Additionally, culture of cells on substrata presenting recombinant T-cadherin protein (acellular presentation) enhanced hepatic functions in both pure hepatocyte cultures and in hepatocyte-stromal cocultures lacking endogenous T-cadherin expression. Collectively, these data indicate that both cellular and acellular presentation of T-cadherin can be used to modulate the hepatocyte phenotype in vitro for tissue engineering applications. Our work suggests potential avenues for investigating the role of T-cadherin on hepatocellular function in vivo in settings such as embryogenesis and liver pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2014440034,"Axin is a scaffold protein for the beta-catenin destruction complex, and a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. Previous studies implicated the six C-terminal amino acids (C6 motif) in the ability of Axin to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and identified them as a SUMOylation target. Deletion of the C6 motif of mouse Axin in vivo reduced the steady-state protein level, which caused embryonic lethality. Here, we report that this deletion (Axin-DeltaC6) causes a reduced half-life in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and an increased susceptibility to ubiquitination in HEK 293T cells. We confirmed the C6 motif as a SUMOylation target in vitro, and found that mutating the C-terminal SUMOylation target residues increased the susceptibility of Axin to polyubiquitination and reduced its steady-state level. Heterologous SUMOylation target sites could replace C6 in providing this protective effect. These findings suggest that SUMOylation of the C6 motif may prevent polyubiquitination, thus increasing the stability of Axin. Although C6 deletion also caused increased association of Axin with Dvl-1, this interaction was not altered by mutating the lysine residues in C6, nor could heterologous SUMOylation motifs replace the C6 motif in this assay. Therefore, some other specific property of the C6 motif seems to reduce the interaction of Axin with Dvl-1."

The DISC consists of oligomerized, probably trimerized CD95, the adaptor molecule FADD, two isoforms of procaspase-8 (procaspase-8/a and procaspase-8/b), procaspase-10, and c-FLIPL/S/R (6Peter M.E.

The death domain of the receptor interacts with the death domain of FADD, whereas the death effector domain (DED) of FADD interacts with the N-terminal tandem DEDs of procaspases-8, -10, and c-FLIPL/S/R. The binding of procaspase-8 to the DISC results in processing of the zymogene, for which a two-step mechanism has been described (11Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M.

In a second cleavage step, the active enzyme subunits p18, p10, and the prodomains p26/p24 are produced.

Activated caspase-8 directly leads to the activation of downstream effector caspases-3 and -7. Type II cells are characterized by lower levels of CD95 DISC formation and thus lower levels of active caspase-8. In this case, signaling requires an additional amplification loop that involves the cleavage by caspase-8 of the Bcl-2 family protein Bid to generate truncated Bid and subsequent truncated Bid-mediated release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (10Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria results in apoptosome formation followed by activation of procaspase-9, which in turn cleaves downstream effector caspases. In this study we reveal the formation of a novel cytosolic signaling complex, which occurs upon CD95 stimulation. This complex includes only the DED-containing proteins procaspase-8, c-FLIP, and FADD and does not contain CD95. This complex plays an important role in the amplification of caspase activation. Cell Lines—The B lymphoblastoid cell lines SKW6.4, Raji, and BJAB and the T cell lines HUT78, Jurkat clones 16, and A3 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), 10 mm HEPES (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in 5% CO2.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and -2b were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Z-IETD-AFC and Z-DEVD-AFC were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Sigma. Caspase Activity Assays—Cytosolic lysates were incubated with 50 μm site-specific tetrapeptide substrates (Z-IETD-AFC for caspase-8 and Z-DEVD-AFC for caspase-3) in a caspase assay buffer B (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 10% (w/v) sucrose, pH 7.4) in a final volume of 200 μl. The release of the fluorogenic group AFC was determined after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C by a microplate fluorescence reader Wallach 1420 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at the excitation wavelength of 405 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm. DISC Analysis by Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—1 × 108 cells were treated with the indicated amounts of LZ-CD95L at 37 °C for the indicated times, washed twice in 1× PBS, and subsequently lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Triton X-100 (Serva, Heidelburg, Germany), and 10% glycerol) or lysed without treatment. The CD95 DISC was immunoprecipitated overnight with 2 μg of anti-APO-1 and protein A-Sepharose beads. Protein A-Sepharose beads were washed five times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, the gels were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with the primary antibodies in PBS/Tween at 4 °C overnight. Blots were developed with a chemiluminescence method following the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Caspase-8 and FADD Immunoprecipitations—1 × 108 cells were treated with LZ-CD95L at 37 °C for the indicated times, washed twice in 1× PBS, and subsequently lysed in buffer A. Caspase-8 and FADD immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-caspase-8 antibodies C15 and anti-FADD antibodies 1C4, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed and analyzed as described for the DISC analysis. Anti-caspase-8 antibodies are IgG2b; however, IgGs were not always detected via Western blot probably due to modification of the IgG2b epitope during PAGE. Anti-FADDs are monoclonal IgG1 antibodies. The Western blot analysis of FADD immunoprecipitations with the secondary IgG1 antibodies typically resulted in the detection of IgGs. Flow Cytometry Analysis—The percentage of viable cells was determined by FSC/SSC using a FACS-scan cytometer (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells per sample was analyzed. Specific cell death was calculated as follows: (percentage of experimental cell death–percentage of spontaneous cell death)/(100–percentage of spontaneous cell death) × 100. In Vitro Translation and in Vitro Caspase-3 Cleavage Assays—Complex II was immunoprecipitated from 1 × 108 SKW6.4 cells. To accomplish this task, 1 × 108 cells were treated with LZ-CD95L at 37 °C for the indicated times, washed twice in 1× PBS, and subsequently lysed in buffer A. Afterward the lysates were immunodepleted from the DISC with two steps of DISC immunoprecipitation with 2 μg of anti-APO-1 and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. Then the supernatants were depleted from anti-APO-1 antibodies with three steps of incubation with 30 μl of protein A beads. Finally, complex II was immunoprecipitated from the remaining supernatant with C15 antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled procaspase-3 (TnT, T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) in caspase cleavage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) at 4 °C overnight. Cleavage reactions were separated on 12% polyacrylamide gel, blotted, and subjected to Western blot analysis. CD95 Stimulation with Different Concentrations of LZ-CD95L Results in Different Kinetics of Caspase-8 Activation—B lymphoblastoid SKW6.4 cells were stimulated with different amounts of LZ-CD95L to analyze kinetics of caspase activation. Stimulation of various cells with LZ-CD95L was shown to activate the CD95-mediated apoptotic pathway: CD95 DISC formation, caspase-8 activation, and thereby apoptosis (16Schmitz I. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 821-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Lavrik I. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Weyd H. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 144-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To confirm previous findings in our experimental setting, we measured specific cell death upon stimulation of SKW6.4 cells with different amounts of LZ-CD95L (Fig. 1A). SKW6.4 cells were efficiently undergoing apoptosis upon addition of LZ-CD95L as described previously. Using Western blot analysis, we observed processing of procaspase-8a/b (p55/p53) to its cleavage products: p43/p41 and p18 (Fig. 1B). This was accompanied by cleavage of procaspase-3, which is a reported substrate of caspase-8 in SKW6.4 cells (12Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M.

This cleavage event indicates not only processing of procaspase-8 but also its catalytic activation. Caspase-3 activation, as judged by the processing of procaspase-3 and cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate, PARP, occurred shortly after caspase-8 activation (Fig. 1B) (19Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we could detect that the strength of caspase activation depends on the amount of LZ-CD95L and takes places from minutes to hours after stimulation. Activation of caspases-8 and -3 peaked within 30 min upon stimulation with a high concentration of LZ-CD95L (1 μg/ml), within hours upon stimulation with the lower amounts of LZ-CD95L (100 ng/ml), and weak processing of procaspase-8/3 to their cleavage products was detectable only at the 3-h time point upon stimulation with even lower amounts of LZ-CD95L (10 ng/ml). We also observed that the strength of caspase activation depends on the amount of LZ-CD95L using caspase-8 and -3 fluorescent substrates Z-IETD-AFC and Z-DEVD-AFC, respectively (Fig. 1, C–F). In contrast to the caspase activation at the CD95 DISC reported to occur within seconds after stimulation, caspase activation in the cytosol took place hours after stimulation. It should be noted that because of the lack of absolute specificity of Z-IETD-AFC, caspase-3 activity might also contribute to the increase in caspase-8 activity measured using Z-IETD-AFC. However, the data from Western blot analysis of caspase-8 and -3 activation (Fig. 1B) show that caspase-3 activation peaks shortly after caspase-8 activation supporting the data of caspase activity assays. Interestingly, it has been reported that the CD95 DISC is formed within seconds after CD95 stimulation, followed by caspase-8 activation at the DISC complex (11Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that CD95 DISC formation at the membrane peaks minutes after stimulation and that the amount of the active CD95 DISC is markedly reduced 1 h after stimulation (21Golks A. Brenner D. Schmitz I. Watzl C. Krueger A. Krammer P.H. Lavrik I.N. Cell Death. Differ. 2006; 13: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The kinetics of DISC formation contradict our results (Fig. 1) as follows: caspase-8 processing/activation in the lysates occurs within hours after stimulation. This suggests that caspase-8 activation may also take place downstream of the DISC, which raises the question whether there are other cytosolic complexes formed upon CD95 stimulation that may activate caspase-8. A Novel DED Protein-containing Complex Is Formed upon CD95 Stimulation—To address the issue whether there are other complexes apart from the DISC that contain procaspase-8, SKW6.4 cells were stimulated with LZ-CD95L followed by caspase-8 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A, right panel). Caspase-8-immunoprecipitation (C8-IP) was performed using the C15 antibodies, directed against the C terminus of procaspase-8 (14Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which was followed by Western blot analysis. Without CD95 stimulation, we observed c-FLIPL associated with procaspase-8a/b. Upon CD95 stimulation we could co-immunoprecipitate FADD, procaspase-8a/b, c-FLIPL/R, as well as cleavage products of procaspase-8 and c-FLIP (Fig. 2A, right panel). Interestingly, we did not detect CD95 in this co-immunoprecipitation. All DED proteins involved in CD95 signal transduction in lymphocytes were detected in this complex as follows: FADD, procaspase-8-a/b, both long and short isoforms of c-FLIP, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPR, respectively. c-FLIPR was shown to be one of two short c-FLIP isoforms present in SKW6.4 cells in our previous work (22Golks A. Brenner D. Fritsch C. Krammer P.H. Lavrik I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14507-14513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). As a positive control we used DISC immunoprecipitation (CD95-IP), which we performed using agonistic anti-APO-1 antibodies in accordance with the method applied in our previous studies (16Schmitz I. Walczak H. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 821-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Lavrik I. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Baumann S. Weyd H. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20633-20640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, left panel). As described before, we could detect CD95, procaspase-8, FADD, and c-FLIP at the DISC (Fig. 2A, left panel). Thus, the analysis of C8-IP indicated that there is a novel DED protein-containing complex formed upon CD95 stimulation that does not contain CD95. Procaspase-8, c-FLIP, and FADD were found to be present in this complex, which we termed complex II. To further confirm these findings, SKW6.4 cells were stimulated with LZ-CD95L. Then we performed immunoprecipitation using anti-FADD antibodies 1C4 (FADD-IP), directed against the C terminus of FADD (13Scaffidi C. Volkland J. Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1236-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). C8-IP, CD95-IP, and protein A-IP were run in parallel (Fig. 2B). Using anti-FADD antibodies, we also observed CD95 stimulation-dependent association of the DED-containing proteins, procaspase-8, FADD, and c-FLIP. To examine the kinetics of complex II formation, we stimulated SKW6.4 cells with LZ-CD95L and analyzed DISC and complex II composition by Western blot (Fig. 2C). Complex II was detected shortly after DISC formation. Four hours after stimulation, all DED proteins were found at the complex II as follows: procaspase-8, FADD, and c-FLIP (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the processing of c-FLIPL to p43-FLIPL at complex II was delayed, whereas at the DISC c-FLIPL was almost completely processed to p43-FLIPL immediately after stimulation. Furthermore, the kinetics of active caspase-8 (p18) generation peaked simultaneously in complex II and in total cellular lysates. This suggests that complex II contributes to the activation of caspase-8 in total cellular lysates. Additionally, we examined the early kinetics of complex II and DISC formation within minutes after stimulation (Fig. 2D). After 2 min of stimulation, we can already co-immunoprecipitate procaspase-8, FADD, and c-FLIP in complex II lacking CD95. Thus, it seems that complex II formation occurs too fast to detect the initial steps using standard immunoprecipitation procedures. Complex II Is Distinct from the CD95 DISC—Next, we aimed to rule out the possibility that complex II is a part of the CD95 DISC. Therefore, we depleted the lysates from the CD95 DISC and subsequently performed C8-IP (Fig. 3). SKW6.4 cells were stimulated with LZ-CD95L, followed by CD95-IP (Fig. 3, lane 1) and C8-IP (Fig. 3, lane 6), which were done in parallel. To ensure the quantitative depletion of the DISC from the lysates, supernatants from CD95-IP (Fig. 3, lane 1) were subjected to the second CD95-IP (Fig. 3, lane 2). This step was repeated for the third time (Fig. 3, lane 3). The amount of CD95 DISC left in the lysates was significantly reduced already after the first CD95-IP (Fig. 3, lane 2). Following the third CD95-IP, the lysates were precleared twice with protein A beads to remove anti-APO-1 antibodies (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, in the lysates depleted from the DISC, we observed the association of FADD, c-FLIP, and procaspase-8 in the absence of CD95 (Fig. 3, lane 7). This experiment shows that the DISC is indeed different from complex II, the latter being composed of FADD, c-FLIP, and procaspase-8. Complex II Is Formed in Both Type I and Type II Cell Lines—Next, we investigated the formation of complex II in other T and B cell lines. We stimulated T cell lines J16 and HUT78 as well as B lymphoblastoid cells SKW6.4, BJAB, and Raji with LZ-CD95L. Stimulation was followed by CD95-IP using agonistic anti-APO-1 antibodies and C8-IP using C15 antibodies (Fig. 4A). In all investigated T and B cell lines, we could co-immunoprecipitate DED-containing proteins procaspase-8a/b, FADD, and c-FLIPL/S/R upon stimulation with LZ-CD95L. Procaspase-8a/b and c-FLIPL in complex II were processed to their cleavage products in all cell lines. Procaspase-8a/b was processed to p43/p41 and to the active subunit p18. C-FLIPL was processed to p43-FLIPL. Notably, SKW6.4, HUT78, Raji, and BJAB cells belong to type I cells, and J16 cells belong to type II cells (12Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). Thus, we observe complex II formation in both type I and type II cells. To further verify these data, the panel of cell lines (SKW6.4, HUT78, Raji, BJAB, and JA3) was stimulated with LZ-CD95L for 30 min and then subjected to FADD-IP in parallel to C8-IP (Fig. 4B). Using FADD-IP, we also observed association of all DED proteins upon CD95 stimulation in both type I and type II cells. Procaspase-8 and c-FLIPL in complex II were also processed to their cleavage products. Procaspase-8 was processed to p43/p41 and to the active subunit p18, indicating that active caspase-8 is generated in the complex II. c-FLIPL was processed to p43-FLIPL. Thus, we have shown that complex II formation is a general phenomenon observed in several T and B cell lines upon CD95 stimulation. Complex II Can Amplify Caspase Activation—To unravel the function of complex II, we investigated whether complex II can cleave procaspase-3 and thereby amplify caspase activation. We have observed active caspase-8 (p18) in complex II, which might possess catalytic function (Figs. 2, 3, 4). Therefore, we immunoprecipitated complex II from the lysates that were immunodepleted from the DISC as we described earlier in Fig. 3. In summary, SKW6.4 cells were stimulated with LZ-CD95L, which was followed by several steps of CD95-IPs, which, in turn, was followed by C8-IP. Afterward, in vitro translated procaspase-3 was added to the C8-IP. The processing of procaspase-3 was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 5A). We have observed the generation of the cleavage product of procaspase-3, p19 upon addition of complex II. The processing of procaspase-3 was rather weak, however. Therefore, we used an in vitro system, and we probably did not have optimal concentrations of complex II and procaspase-3 leading to more efficient processing of procaspase-3. Therefore, we concluded that complex II might process procaspase-3, which would lead to the amplification of caspase activation. To further analyze whether complex II forms a bigger complex involving other pro-apoptotic components such as procaspase-3 and procaspase-9, we checked procaspase-3/9 presence in complex II using Western blot (Fig. 5, B and C). However, we did not detect either procaspase-3 or procaspase-9 in complex II. Hence, caspase-8 is the main caspase contributing to pro-apoptotic catalytic activity of complex II. As CD95 stimulation was also reported to induce NF-κBin parallel to apoptosis induction, we analyzed the activation of this pathway upon LZ-CD95L stimulation. We observed the activation of NF-κB in SKW6.4 cells as judged by phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 5D). To analyze the possible involvement of complex II in the transduction of pro-survival signals, we checked complex II immunoprecipitated from SKW6.4 for the presence of TRAF2 and RIP1, which were reported to be involved in the CD95-mediated NF-κB activation (24Kreuz S. Siegmund D. Rumpf J.J. Samel D. Leverkus M. Janssen O. Hacker G. Dittrich-Breiholz O. Kracht M. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 25Siegmund D. Klose S. Zhou D.H. Baumann B. Roder C. Kalthoff H. Wajant H. Trauzold A. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 1172-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, we could not detect TRAF2 and RIP1 in the DISC and complex II using Western blot analysis (Fig. 5E). As our analysis involves only one cell line, SKW6.4 cells, we could not exclude that TRAF2 and RIP1 might be components of these complexes. The role of complex II in CD95-mediated pro-survival signaling should be further analyzed in future studies and might also involve new unidentified proteins in this complex. In this study we describe a new complex, which includes the following DED-containing proteins: FADD, c-FLIP, and procaspase-8, which are the main components of the CD95 DISC. This complex is formed upon stimulation of CD95; however, it does not contain the death receptor (Fig. 6). The main function of complex II in CD95-induced apoptosis is likely the activation of procaspase-8 and amplification of caspase activation. The mechanism of complex II formation remains to be determined. It was reported that upon stimulation CD95 undergoes cluster formation at the cellular membrane. Clustering of CD95 involves several steps. CD95 DISC formation is accompanied by building of stable microaggregates (26Lee K.H. Feig C. Tchikov V. Schickel R. Hallas C. Schutze S. Peter M.E. Chan A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Algeciras-Schimnich A. Shen L. Barnhart B.C. Murmann A.E. Burkhardt J.K. Peter M.E. Mol. Cell.

This is followed by formation of SPOTS (signaling protein oligomeric transduction structures) leading to receptor clustering into large platforms (29Siegel R.M. Muppidi J.R. Sarker M. Lobito A. Jen M. Martin D. Straus S.E. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that FADD plays an important structural role as a linker for these platforms (30Carrington P.E. Sandu C. Wei Y. Hill J.M. Morisawa G. Huang T. Gavathiotis E. Wei Y. Werner M.H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 31Sandu C. Morisawa G. Wegorzewska I. Huang T. Arechiga A.F. Hill J.M. Kim T. Walsh C.M. Werner M.H. Cell Death. Differ. 2006; 13: 2052-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of modification or conformational changes at the membrane, the cytosolic part of this platform comprising DED proteins might translocate to the cytoplasm and build a second cytosolic complex, complex II. Our study suggests that in complex II procaspase-8 molecules are brought into close proximity, which is followed by their activation (32Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 33Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). We have observed the formation of active caspase-8 (p18) in complex II using both FADD-IP and C8-IP (Figs. 2, 3, 4). This provides an indication that procaspase-8 undergoes autocatalytic processing generating active caspase-8 in complex II. Furthermore, we observed that complex II can process procaspase-3 in vitro. These data support the hypothesis that complex II indeed amplifies the caspase activation in the cytosol. Another mechanism of amplification of the CD95-mediated death signal in the cytosol has recently been proposed. This mechanism involves the internalization of the CD95 DISC in type I cells (26Lee K.H. Feig C. Tchikov V. Schickel R. Hallas C. Schutze S. Peter M.E. Chan A.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1009-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We clearly do not see CD95 in complex II (Figs. 2 and 3) and also observe complex II formation in type II cells, e.g. JA3 and J16 cells (Fig. 4). Thus, we show that the mechanism of complex II formation is independent of the mechanism of CD95 internalization. The possibility of cross-talk between these two pathways has to be addressed in future studies. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that a number of cytosolic complexes formed upon death receptor stimulation are essential for life/death decisions. The formation of complex II comprising procaspase-8, c-FLIP, FADD, RIP, TRADD, and TRAF2 was described for tumor necrosis factor signaling (34Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The main function of this complex involves the transduction of the death signal, e.g. caspase-8 activation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that upon TRAIL stimulation the same molecules are involved in the formation of a secondary complex, and this complex is essential for the transduction of both life and death signals (35Varfolomeev E. Maecker H. Sharp D. Lawrence D. Renz M. Vucic D. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40599-40608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Jin and El Deiry (36Jin Z. El Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8136-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have suggested the possibility of complex II formation in CD95 signaling. Here we demonstrate the formation of a secondary DED-protein-containing complex, which occurs upon CD95 stimulation. This complex likely plays a central role in the cytosolic activation of procaspase-8 or might also contain components leading into pathways of proliferation. The understanding of the role of complex II in life and death pathways is a matter of future studies. There have been a number of reports demonstrating that upon T cell receptor stimulation procaspase-8 and FADD form a cytosolic complex together with Malt1 and Bcl-10, playing an important role in the activation of NF-κB (37Su H. Bidere N. Zheng L. Cubre A. Sakai K. Dale J. Salmena L. Hakem R. Straus S. Lenardo M. Science. 2005; 307: 1465-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that catalytic activity of procaspase-8 is required for NF-κB activation. Recently, it was also demonstrated that in monocytes undergoing macrophage differentiation, procaspase-8 forms an atypical complex together with FADD and RIP. This complex contributes to the regulation of NF-κB activity and, subsequently, to the process of macrophage differentiation (38Rebe C. Cathelin S. Launay S. Filomenko R. Prevotat L. L'Ollivier C. Gyan E. Micheau O. Grant S. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Fontenay M. Solary E. Blood. 2007; 109: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, there can be two platforms for caspase-8 activation in the cytosolic complexes as follows: one in the death induction in complex II and another one in the proliferation-inducing Bcl-10-Malt1 complex. Elucidation of the stoichiometry and composition of these complexes may certainly shed light on the mechanism of caspase-8 activation in both pathways and provide more understanding of the life and death decisions made in the cell. Taken together, we have described a novel caspase-8 activating complex formed upon CD95 stimulation. We suggest that life/death decision making takes place not only at membrane complexes but that cytosolic complexes are also essential for this decision. We thank Dr. Dirk Brenner for critical comments, Petra Richter for help with experiments, and Heidi Saunter for excellent secretary work."
https://openalex.org/W2114990525,"A class of multivalent protein binders was designed to overcome the limitations of low-affinity therapeutic antibodies. These binders, termed ""collabodies,"" use a triplex-forming collagen-like peptide to drive the trimerization of a heterologous target-binding domain. Different forms of collabody, consisting of the human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) fused to either the N or C terminus of the collagen-like peptide scaffold (Gly-Pro-Pro)(10), were stably expressed as soluble secretory proteins in mammalian cells. The collabody consisting of scFv fused to the N terminus of collagen scaffold is present as a homotrimer, whereas it exhibited a mixture of trimer and interchain disulfide-bonded hexamer when cysteine residues were introduced and flanked the scaffold. The collagenous motif in collabody is prolyl-hydroxylated, with remarkable thermal and serum stabilities. The collabody erb_scFv-Col bound to the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor with a binding strength approximately 20- and 1000-fold stronger than the bivalent and monovalent counterparts, respectively. The trimeric collagen scaffold does not compromise the functionality of the binding moieties of parental immunoglobulin G (IgG); therefore, it could be applied to fuse other protein molecules to acquire significantly improved targeting-binding strengths."

Located in the ER membrane, STIM1 contains an intraluminal N-terminal EF-hand Ca2+ binding domain, which is shown to have low affinity for Ca2+ with a Kd of ∼0.4 mm (10Stathopulos P.B. Li G.Y.

Upon depletion of Ca2+ from stores, the STIM1 protein in the ER undergoes a profound change from a diffuse labeling pattern across the ER to an aggregated or “punctate” appearance (6Roos J.

It was reported that STIM1 may become inserted into the PM following store depletion and hence activate SOCs (9Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A.

Despite this, there is good evidence that STIM1 translocates within the ER into junctional domains that are juxtaposed with the PM and close enough (within 10-25 nm) that direct interactions may occur with the plasma membrane (7Liou J.

Further screens of gene products involved in the store-operated Ca2+ entry pathway revealed the role of the Orai1 (or CRACM1) protein (15Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H.

Orai1 is a tetraspanning membrane protein localized to the plasma membrane and appears to be the functional store-operated channel moiety (18Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O.

Orai1 coexpressed with STIM1 reconstitutes massive levels of the highly Ca2+-selective Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (14Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S.

Indeed, mutation of the Orai1 protein at key acidic residues alters the ion selectivity of the channel (18Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O.

Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2073-2079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), indicating that Orai1 is the pore-forming entity in SOCs. Orai and STIM appear to co-migrate, possibly with other coupling proteins, to form junctional ER-PM coupling domains that are the functional sites of store-operated Ca2+ entry (11Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Luik R.M. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 12Varnai P. Toth B. Toth D. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29678-29690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).Although Orai1 appears to be exclusively located in the PM, STIM1 is not exclusive to the ER. Indeed, STIM1 was originally discovered through a novel screening strategy to identify extracellularly expressed PM proteins in stromal cells promoting the proliferation of pre-B cells in culture (23Oritani K. Kincade P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 771-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). STIM1 was characterized as a plasma membrane protein involved in controlling cell growth (24Williams R.T.

It was estimated in myeloid cell lines that as much as 25% of total STIM1 was expressed on the cell surface with its N terminus accessible to the cell exterior (26Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Williams R.T. Van Stekelenburg L. Pearson R.B. Dziadek M.A. Smith P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), although clearly the expression of STIM1 in the ER predominates over plasma membrane expression (13Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P. Xu W. Johnstone L.S. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 26Manji S.S.

In the current study, we have addressed the question of the location, translocation, and function of STIM1 by generating stable cell lines expressing STIM1 with mutated acidic residues to prevent Ca2+ binding in the EF-hand domain. Earlier studies revealed that such mutants of STIM1 could constitutively activate store-operated Ca2+ entry, mimicking the store-depleted condition (7Liou J. Kim M.L. Heo W.D. Jones J.T. Myers J.W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 8Spassova M.A. Soboloff J. He L.P. Xu W. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4040-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 9Zhang S.L. Yu Y. Roos J. Kozak J.A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Stauderman K.A. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2005; 437: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Examination of the function of the EF-hand-mutated STIM1 molecule is particularly important in these cells, since the activation process for SOCs can be studied under conditions in which ER Ca2+ stores are not depleted, thus bypassing the severe stress effects of depleting Ca2+ from within the ER (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4370) Google Scholar, 28Berridge M.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The establishment of cell lines with constitutively active STIM1 was remarkable, since the prolonged entry of Ca2+ would have been predicted to be highly damaging to the cells. Our results reveal that important compensatory Ca2+ homeostatic mechanisms probably counteract the increased entry, and we document that one such compensation is a turn-off of the powerful but enigmatic ER Ca2+ leak pathway. We establish that, unlike wild type STIM1, the STIM1 EF-hand mutant is exclusively expressed in the ER and can activate plasma membrane Orai1 without becoming inserted into the plasma membrane. Although not inserted in the membrane during store depletion, the STIM1 mutant undergoes a strong interaction with the plasma membrane. In contrast to the EF-hand mutant, wild type STIM1 is clearly expressed in the plasma membrane as well as ER. Although plasma membrane STIM1 may not be essential for Orai1 channel activation, the results indicate that it may play a role in regulating the activation of store-operated channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs and Transfections—Wild type (WT) human STIM1 and STIM2 were subcloned into pIRESneo (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as previously described (25Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Human STIM1-D76A/E87A mutations were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Orai1 knockdown was achieved using stealth small interfering RNA (Invitrogen) targeting position 901 (UGGUGCCCUUCGGCCUGAUCUUUAU) or 1381 (CCUCCUCCUGUCCUGUCCGUCUCAA). A scrambled RNA sequence (UGGCCUCCUGGCCGUUAUCUGUUAU) was used as a control. DNA constructs and RNA sequences were introduced by electroporation using the Gene Pulser II electroporation system (Bio-Rad) at 350 V, 960 microfarads, and infinite resistance, followed by 48 h in culture.Development of Stable Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were maintained as previously described (13Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P. Xu W. Johnstone L.S. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). HEK293 stable cell lines were generated by electroporation of the above described human STIM2 or STIM1 (WT or D76A/E87A) constructs, followed by selection with G418 and cloning as previously described (12Varnai P. Toth B. Toth D. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29678-29690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected based upon STIM1 expression and the level of store-operated Ca2+ entry.Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Ratiometric imaging of intracellular Ca2+ using fura-2 was as previously described (29Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Xu W. He L.P. Cuesta N. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39786-39794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips were placed in cation-safe solution (107 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2) and loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) for 30 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 30 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm, as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (30Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Ca2+ measurements were made using an InCyt dual wavelength fluorescence imaging system (Intracellular Imaging Inc.). Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm; intracellular Ca2+ measurements are shown as 340/380 nm ratios obtained from groups (35-45 cells each) of single cells. Resting intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was determined based on ratiometric measurements of cells maintained in 1 mm Ca2+ and calculated according to the following formula of Grynkiewcz et al. (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 261: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), [Ca2+]i=Kd×(Fmin/Fmax)×(R-Rmin)/(Rmax-R)(Eq. 1) where R represents the ratio of the fluorescence intensities measured at 340 and 380 nm during the experiments, and F is the fluorescence intensity measured at 505 nm. Rmin, Rmax, Fmin, and Fmax were determined from in situ calibration of unlysed cells using 40 μm ionomycin in the absence (Rmin and Fmin; 10 mm EGTA) and presence (Rmax and Fmax) of Ca2+. Kd (135 nm) is the dissociation constant for fura-2 at room temperature. Measurements shown as means ± S.E. of traces from ∼30-40 individual cells and are representative of a minimum of three and in most cases a larger number of independent experiments.Luminal ER Ca2+ Measurements—CFP (436Ex/480Em) and FRETraw (436Ex/535Em) were imaged at 5 mHz in HEK293 cells transfected with the ER-targeted cameleon, D1ER (32Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), using a Leica DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope controlled by Slide-Book 4.2 software (Olympus). Two-channel corrected FRET was calculated based on the formula, FRETc=(Fraw-Fd/Dd*FCFP)/FCFP(Eq. 2) where FRETc represents the corrected total amount of energy transfer, Fraw represents measured fluorescence measured through the CFP/YFP ET filter cube, FCFP represents measured CFP fluorescence, and Fd/Dd represents measured bleed-through of CFP through the YFP filter (0.592248). In order to determine absolute Ca2+ concentration, maximum FRETc (Rmax) was measured via the addition of 10 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+/ATP to digitonin (25 μm)-permeabilized cells, whereas minimum FRETc was measured upon the subsequent addition of 3 μm Br-A23187 with 5 mm EGTA (33Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). ER Ca2+ content was then determined based on the following formula of Palmer and Tsien (33Palmer A.E. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), &x0025;ΔR=(Rmax1[Ca2+]n1/(Kd1'n1+[Ca+2]n1))+(Rmax2[Ca2+]n2/(Kd2'n2+[Ca2+]n2))(Eq. 3) in which %ΔR = (R - Rmin)/Rmax - Rmin)*100, K′d1 = 0.58, K′d2 = 56.46, Rmax1 = 28, Rmax2 = 72, n1 = 1.18, and n2 = 1.67. Immunoprecipitation and Cell Lysis—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors), cleared by centrifugation, and normalized for protein content. For immunoprecipitation, lysates (200 μg) were mixed with 50 μl of a 50% protein G slurry (Calbiochem) that was precoated for 1 h with the indicated antibodies (5 μl/sample). The samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation and were then washed three times with lysis buffer. After the final wash, beads were resuspended in gel-loading buffer and boiled for 5 min.Surface Biotinylation—Biotinylation studies were performed on HEK293 cells using NHS-LC-Biotin (1 mg/ml; Pierce) for 30 min. Unbound biotin was quenched with Tris (75 mm) prior to lysis. Biotinylated proteins were either run on gels as whole lysates (15 μg/lane) or separated from unbiotinylated proteins using streptavidin-coated beads (100 μg/lane). STIM1 and STIM2 were detected by Western analysis using an anti-STIM1 monoclonal antibody that cross-reacts with STIM2 (BD Biosciences) (25Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J. Hancock M.S. Van Stekelenburg L. Eid J.P. Senior P.V. Kazenwadel J.S. Shandala T. Saint R. Smith P.J. Dziadek M.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation and then washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in gel-loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min before loading on gels.Western Blot and Flow Cytometry—For Western blots, proteins were resolved on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and analyzed with the indicated antibodies, as previously described (29Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Xu W. He L.P. Cuesta N. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39786-39794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For flow cytometry, HEK293 cell lines were labeled with anti-STIM1 (BD Biosciences), followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), using Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Results are histograms based upon 10,000 events/sample. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were transfected as described and plated onto 10-mm circular coverslips in OPTI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (13Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P. Xu W. Johnstone L.S. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Fixation and permeabilization were achieved by incubation (10 min) with 3.7% formaldehyde followed by permeabilization in the following buffer: 100 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 6.9, with KOH. After blocking in bovine serum albumin (0.5%), cells were blocked with BSA and labeled with affinity-purified rabbit anti-STIM1 CT (1:50 dilution), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 dilution; Invitrogen). For nonpermeabilized cells, labeling with antibodies was undertaken on live cells, followed by fixation with formaldehyde. Fixed and labeled cells were mounted onto slides in Cytoseal 60 (VWR) and examined with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal laser-scanning microscope, using a ×63/numerical aperture 1.4 objective.TIRF Microscopy—HEK293 cells were transfected with YFP-STIM1-WT or YFP-STIM1-D76A and plated onto 25-mm circular coverslips in OPTI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (13Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Hewavitharana T. He L.P. Xu W. Johnstone L.S. Dziadek M.A. Gill D.L. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1465-1470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the day of the experiment, cells were transferred to cation-safe solution. The images were recorded on a high resolution Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera using a through-the-lens ×60 TIRF objective in a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope while exciting with a 488-nm argon ion laser set to TIRF mode. Store depletion was achieved with the addition of thapsigargin (2 μm) while recording. Image analysis of puncta was undertaken using Image J and SlideBook 4.2 (Olympus). Background was subtracted from the raw image, and noise (less than 10 consecutive pixels) was filtered out. Images were imported into SlideBook, and the size and number of puncta were measured using the mask function. The density of puncta was obtained by dividing the number of puncta by the size of the cell. Relative cell size was measured from cell profile using Image J.Quantitative PCR—Real time quantitative PCR was performed in a model 7300 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems) using Superscript II Platinum SYBR Green one-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kits, and the 7300 System SDS Software. Reaction mixtures contained reverse transcriptase and TaqDNA polymerase in a single enzyme mix with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye, ROX as reference dye, 30 ng of total RNA, and gene-specific primers.

https://openalex.org/W2136624327,"P2X receptors are ATP-gated nonselective cation channels with important physiological roles. However, their structures are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the architecture of P2X receptors using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy and direct structure determination using electron microscopy. FRET efficiency measurements indicated that the distance between the C-terminal tails of P2X(4) receptors was 5.6 nm. Single particle analysis of purified P2X(4) receptors was used to determine the three-dimensional structure at a resolution of 21A; the orientation of the particle with respect to the membrane was assigned by labeling the intracellular C termini with 1.8-nm gold particles and the carbohydrate-rich ectodomain with lectin. We found that human P2X(4) is a globular torpedo-like molecule with an approximate volume of 270 nm(3) and a compact propeller-shaped ectodomain. In this structure, the distance between the centers of the gold particles was 6.1 nm, which closely matches FRET data. Thus, our data provide the first views of the architecture, shape, and size of single P2X receptors, furthering our understanding of this important family of ligand-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2074710001,"Intercellular transfer of surface molecules has been demonstrated in vitro, or in vivo under artificial situations. Transplantation is a unique clinical situation in which foreign major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are deliberately introduced. This provides a model to study intercellular MHC transfer because donor MHC molecules can easily be tracked. Here we describe the bidirectional transfer of MHC class II molecules between donor and recipient cells after transplantation of vascularized kidney and cardiac allografts in mice. Cells that are positive for both donor and recipient MHC class II accounted for up to 30% of the donor MHC class II(+) population, suggesting that they play a significant role in the antigen presentation process. The majority of these cells were dendritic cells, but macrophages and B cells were also able to acquire foreign MHC molecules. Most double-positive cells were also positive for costimulatory molecules, indicating a capability to elicit a T-cell response. This transfer of MHC molecules between donor and recipient cells provides a link between the direct and indirect pathways of alloantigen presentation and suggests that MHC transfer is also likely to occur under normal physiological conditions, which has implications in the fields of infection, vaccination, and tumor immunology."
https://openalex.org/W2072495063,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a major intracellular Ca2+ channel, modulated by many factors in the cytosolic and lumenal compartments. Compared with cytosolic control, lumenal-side regulation has been much less studied, and some of its mechanistic aspects have been controversial. Of particular interest with regard to lumenal regulation are whether it involves direct interactions between IP3R and the regulators, and whether it involves conformational changes of the lumenal regions of IP3R. To understand these lumenal-side regulation mechanisms, we studied the effects of two important lumenal regulatory factors, the redox potential and Ca2+, on the L3-1 lumenal loop region of IP3R. The redox potential exerted direct and significant effects on the conformation of the loop region. By sharp contrast, Ca2+ showed little effect on the L3-1 conformation, suggesting that the regulation of Ca2+ is indirect or involves other receptor regions. GSH/oxidized glutathione-mediated oxidation introduced a unique intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys34 and Cys42. A variety of NMR experiments revealed that oxidation also induces localized helical characteristics in the Cys34-Cys42 region. Dynamics studies also showed reduced motions in the region upon oxidation, consistent with the conformational changes. The results raise the interesting possibility that Cys34 and Cys42 may act together as a reduction sensor, and that Cys65 may function as an oxidation sensor. Overall, our studies suggest that the redox potential and Ca2+ can regulate IP3R through totally different mechanisms: Ca2+ by the indirect effect and the redox potential by direct action causing conformational changes.

Overall, our studies suggest that the redox potential and Ca2+ can regulate IP3R through totally different mechanisms: Ca2+ by the indirect effect and the redox potential by direct action causing conformational changes. Ca2+ is an important messenger in cellular signaling, and its intracellular concentration is tightly regulated (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4305) Google Scholar). The misregulation of Ca2+ has been implicated in a variety of abnormalities such as Alzheimer disease, cancer, and cardiomyopathies (2LaFerla F.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 3Berridge M.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 930-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Braunewell K.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cellular Ca2+ concentration is modulated by either the import of extracellular Ca2+ or the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular Ca2+ stores. A major player in mobilizing this intracellular Ca2+ is inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), 2The abbreviations used are: IP3Rinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateTEVtobacco etch virusDTTdithiothreitolBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidGSSGoxidized glutathioneHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. a membrane-associated Ca2+ channel (5Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Because the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration is in the submicromolar range, about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that in the Ca2+ stores (6Meldolesi J. Pozzan T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), opening of IP3R at the Ca2+ stores can elicit a local increase in the Ca2+ concentration. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate tobacco etch virus dithiothreitol 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid oxidized glutathione heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. IP3R is a large membrane-associated protein with ∼2700 amino acids (see Ref. 7Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar for an excellent review). To date, three isoforms of IP3R have been identified, and the homo- or heterotetramer of these isoforms constitutes the functional Ca2+ channels (8Taylor C.W. da Fonseca P.C. Morris E.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 210-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The single IP3R polypeptide chain topologically consists of three parts: the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, both located in the cytoplasmic compartment, and the channel domain with six transmembrane and loop regions (see supplemental Fig. S1). The N-terminal region can be further divided functionally into the suppressor region, the IP3-binding region, and the modulatory region (9Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The suppressor domain weakens the receptor affinity toward IP3, the cognate ligand (11Devogelaere B. Verbert L. Parys J.B.

However, the domain is also required for proper channel gating and has been shown to be a central platform for a variety of protein interactions (5Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

The IP3-binding region is the core ligand-binding site and undergoes substantial domain rearrangement upon ligand interaction (10Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The modulatory domain binds a variety of small molecules or proteins such as ATP, Ca2+, FKBP12, calmodulin, and protein kinase A, which are believed to regulate the channel activity (7Foskett J.K. White C. Cheung K.H. Mak D.O. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 593-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 10Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As can be inferred from the compositional complexity, the regulation of IP3R is also multifaceted. IP3 and Ca2+ themselves are the two major regulators, but numerous other small factors as well as macromolecules modulate IP3R channel activity (5Patterson R.L. Boehning D. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 437-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). X-ray analyses have suggested that IP3 association with the ligand-binding region displaces the suppressor domain, allowing Ca2+ binding to occur at the stimulatory sites (10Bosanac I. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 16Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the Ca2+ binding induces a large conformational change, as seen in electron microscopic images, leading to the activation of the channel (17Hamada K. Terauchi A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52881-52889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, Ca2+, especially at high concentrations, can also inhibit the channel activity, leading to a well known biphasic regulation (18Taylor C.W. Laude A.J. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Iino M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1103-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 20Sienaert I. Missiaen L.

There is evidence that such negative regulation is mediated by calmodulin (21Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Weidema A.F. Sipma H. Vanlingen S. De Smet P. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and thus the exact mechanism remains unresolved. Incomplete knowledge of the number and position of the Ca2+-binding sites in IP3R has hampered detailed understanding of the Ca2+-mediated regulation mechanism. IP3Rs are critically regulated on the lumenal side as well, although fewer lumenal-side modulators are known than their cytoplasmic counterparts. Chromogranins have been shown to bind directly to the L3-2 region of IP3R and increase the channel activity (23Yoo S.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 24Thrower E.C. Park H.Y. So S.H. Yoo S.H. Ehrlich B.E. J. Biol.

Recently, a thioredoxin-domain-containing protein, ERp44, was demonstrated to negatively regulate type I IP3R (26Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Not only proteins but also other factors modulate the channel from the lumenal side. Ca2+ is probably the most studied lumenal factor, but there has been disagreement on whether it is a positive (27Parys J.B. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25206-25212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Missiaen L. Taylor C.W. Berridge M.J. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36049-36055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanistic detail of Ca2+ regulation has also been controversial, with some reports supporting direct interaction (30Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 31Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 372: 791-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34Shuttleworth T.J. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Another lumenal factor, the redox potential, has also been inferred to regulate IP3R, by affecting the binding of ERp44, a lumenal-side negative regulator, to the L3-1 loop of IP3R (26Higo T. Hattori M. Nakamura T. Natsume T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Cell. 2005; 120: 85-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the redox potential could affect the free thiol status of the L3-1 region's three cysteines, which are critical for interaction with ERp44. Therefore, the effect of the redox potential on channel activity seems to be indirect and protein-mediated. However, a detailed description of the nature of the redox-mediated changes is still lacking. Lumenal-side regulation has been proposed to involve conformational changes of IP3R that can affect the channel activity (29Thrower E.C. Mobasheri H. Dargan S. Marius P. Lea E.J. Dawson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36049-36055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Oldershaw K.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Particularly, Ca2+ was suggested to induce conformational changes in the L3-1 region (31Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, due to the absence of detailed conformational studies on the lumenal regions, key questions on their regulations remain unanswered: 1) What are the natures of the conformational changes? and 2) Are those changes induced directly by the regulatory factors or indirectly through additional entities? To help understand these issues, we studied the conformational effects on the L3-1 region by two important lumenal regulators, Ca2+ and the redox potential, whose detailed regulatory effects are still either controversial or unknown. We present evidence showing that the redox potential affects the thiol status of two specific cysteines and directly changes the conformation and dynamics of the disulfide-containing region. In sharp contrast, we find that Ca2+ hardly affects the conformation of the L3-1 region and might engage the region indirectly during its regulation of IP3R. Our findings suggest that the two important regulators of IP3R mediate their regulation in very different ways. Cloning of L3-1 Gene—The L3-1 region sequence of bovine IP3R was amplified with PCR method. Sense primer has a GATGACAAGCCATGGCAAAAGATGACTTCATCTTGGAAGTAGATAGGCTG sequence, and the antisense primer has a AAACTCGGTACCTCACTCGCACGTGTGCTCTTTATCTTGCTC sequence. The PCR product was purified, digested with NcoI and KpnI, and then ligated into the His-thioredoxin vector (His-Trx, pETM-20 from Dr. Ario de Marco, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) using the DNA Ligation Kit (Takara Korea, Seoul, Korea). The ligated construct was transformed into Rosetta (DE3) Escherichia coli-competent cells. Colonies with recombinant plasmid were selected by small scale expression test and colony PCR. All the DNA constructs were sequenced for final confirmation (Macrogene, Seoul, Korea) and found to be correct. Expression and Purification of L3-1—Cells harboring recombinant His-Trx-L3-1 was cultured in LB media, with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, until its A600 reached 0.4 at 37 °C. Then the culture was cooled on ice briefly and subsequently grown at 20 °C in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. When the A600 became larger than 1.0, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,427 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The cells were broken by sonication, and total cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the Trx-L3-1 was incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4 °C for 15 min. The protein-bound resin was washed with 200 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The bound protein was eluted with 40 ml of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The eluted protein was concentrated with an ultrafiltration device (5 kDa MWCO, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The His-Trx tag was removed by tobacco etch protease (TEV). For the cleavage, TEV protease, along with protease inhibitors and 5 mm DTT, were directly added to the protein solution. The cleavage reaction was performed overnight at 4 °C, and the extent of cleavage was monitored with 18% SDS-PAGE. TEV protease was prepared in the laboratory using the gene provided by Dr. David Waugh in NCI, National Institutes of Health (Frederick, MD). The L3-1 protein was purified from the reaction mixture by gel filtration with Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) using gel-filtration buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.0). Isotopically labeled protein samples (15N, 13C, or in combination) were prepared by growing the cells in M9 minimal medium (42 mm Na2HPO4, 24 mm KH2PO4, 9 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 ug/ml thiamine) (typically, 2 liters) with [15N]H4Cl (1 g/liter) and [13C]glucose (1 g/liter) as sole nitrogen and carbon sources depending on the labeling requirement. The purification steps were identical with the unlabeled samples. Reduction and Oxidation of IP3R L3-1—Purified L3-1 was buffer-exchanged to 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0) by using a PD-10 cartridge. For the reduced form of L3-1, final 5 mm DTT was added. Oxidation of the L3-1 was carried out by using the GSH/GSSG mixture system. GSH and GSSG were solubilized (20 mm and 2 mm, respectively) in the 50 mm MES buffer, and pH was readjusted to 6.0. One-tenth volume of the GSH/GSSG buffer was added to the protein solution, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature overnight. The extent of oxidation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence and absence of DTT in the Laemmli sample buffer. For samples for Ca2+ binding studies, any pre-bound Ca2+ was removed by treating the protein sample with EGTA (5 mm) at pH 8.0. pH 8.0 was chosen, because EGTA exhibits very high affinity to Ca2+ (Kd ∼ 4 nm) at the condition. The samples were then buffer-exchanged back to 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0). All the buffers for the decalcification steps were treated with Chelex-100 resin. The effectiveness of this Ca2+ removal procedure was proven in our laboratory by removing pre-bound Ca2+ from calmodulin, which shows a diagnostic set of NMR peaks depending on its Ca2+ bound or apo status. NMR Spectroscopy and Ca2+ Binding Experiment—NMR spectroscopy was carried out with samples in 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, buffer with either 5 mm DTT (reduced L3-1) or GSH/GSSG (oxidized L3-1). Typical protein concentration was ∼700 μm. The final NMR sample had 5% D2O for lock purpose. A Ca2+ binding experiment was performed by addition of 400 mm CaCl2·50 mm MES buffer to the L3-1 sample. The HSQC spectra were taken using a Varian Unity Inova 400 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance Z-gradient probe. Backbone triple resonance experiments and the heteronuclear NOE experiments were done on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe. 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectra (with 80-ms mixing time) were obtained with a Bruker Avance 800, 900-MHz spectrometer with a room temperature probe (Korea Basic Science Institute, Ochang, Korea, supported by Bio-MR research program by the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology (E28070)). For the backbone assignments, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO were obtained (36Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 37Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The nitrogen spectral width was set to 20 ppm to take advantage of the narrow 15N dispersion of the peaks. Initial sampling delay for the 15N dimension was set to one-half of dwell time for the discrimination of the aliased peaks by their signs of the intensities. The backbone spectra were acquired with non-linear sampling scheme to reduce the spectrometer time. Total of 550 indirect points were obtained for HNCACB and CBCA-(CO)NH, which would take 1600 points in linear sampling scheme for equivalent resolution. For HNCO and HN(CA)CO, total of 400 total indirect dimension points were obtained. In addition, four step phase cycles, instead of the usual eight cycles, were used for all of the above spectra to further reduce the time. Consequently, the four triple resonance spectra could be obtained in 12 h. The non-linearly sampled spectra were processed using the Roland NMR toolkit (38Hoch J.C. Stern A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 338: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and linearly obtained spectra were processed using NMRPipe (39Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J.

HNHA and heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE data were obtained and analyzed by using the standard procedures (40Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Alanine residues were excluded from the analysis due to possible irregular relaxation behaviors of the alpha protons (41Park S. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.

Effects of Redox Potential on the Conformation of L3-1—To obtain insights into the effects of the redox potential on the conformation of L3-1, we prepared the recombinant L3-1 region in buffers with either DTT (reduced L3-1) or GSH/GSSG (oxidized L3-1). We first investigated if there were any mobility changes in the SDS-gel according to the redox potential, which might suggest changes in the disulfide bond status (Fig. 1A). Among the L3-1 samples prepared in the GSH/GSSG oxidizing system, the one analyzed in the SDS sample buffer without DTT migrated faster than that with DTT (lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, the samples prepared in the DTT buffer migrated at the same slower rates regardless of the presence of DTT (lanes 3 and 4). These mobility data suggest that there should be disulfide bonds in the sample oxidized by the GSH/GSSG system, and that the sample prepared in the DTT buffer has fully reduced cysteines. Actually, there are three cysteines that could form either intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bond(s) in the L3-1 region. The absence of any visible higher molecular weight species in lane 1, however, suggests that the disulfide bond should be intramolecular rather than intermolecular. In light of these changes in covalent structures, we further determined, by means of 15N-HSQC NMR experiments, if there were conformational differences between the reduced and the oxidized L3-1. It is well established that the peak positions of the HSQC spectrum are very sensitive to conformational changes. The spectrum of the reduced form (Fig. 1B, left spectrum) showed a very narrow resonance dispersion in both the 1H and 15N dimensions, indicating that the reduced form is mostly in an unfolded state. By contrast, the spectrum of the oxidized form (Fig. 1B, right spectrum) showed a larger peak dispersion, with peaks unseen in the reduced sample. These results suggest that the oxidized form has a substantially different conformation, possibly with characteristics of the secondary structure. Effects of Ca2+ on the Conformation of Oxidized and Reduced L3-1—Because there are reports on lumenal Ca2+-mediated regulation of IP3R as well as on possible direct Ca2+ -IP3R interaction (30Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 31Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39503-39508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we carried out a Ca2+ binding experiment with the HSQC NMR approach. Given the pronounced effect of the redox potential on the conformation of the L3-1 region, we wanted to determine if Ca2+ could affect the conformation to a similar extent. To test any differential effects of Ca2+ according to the redox status, we performed a Ca2+ titration experiment with both the oxidized and reduced forms of IP3R L3-1. To our surprise, the NMR data showed that there were virtually no changes in the spectra in the presence or absence of a high concentration of free Ca2+ (2 mm final concentration (Fig. 2)). Moreover, the absence of spectral changes was independent of the oxidation status: the spectra neither of the oxidized nor the reduced L3-1 showed any changes. These results suggest that Ca2+, regardless of the oxidation status, neither binds to this L3-1 region directly nor induces any significant conformational changes. Residue-specific Assignments and Determination of Disulfide-bonded Cysteines—Given the absence of changes induced by Ca2+, we concentrated on characterizing the nature of the changes induced by the redox potential. Because the SDS-gel mobility and the HSQC spectrum of the GSH/GSSH-oxidized L3-1 suggested that there should be intramolecular disulfide bond(s), we carried out NMR experiments to identify the cysteine residues involved. First, we assigned the backbone and Cβ resonances of both the oxidized and reduced forms of L3-1 using triple resonance NMR experiments. From the assignment, we constructed a CACB strip plot for the three cysteine residues, Cys34, Cys42, and Cys65, to compare the chemical shifts of the Cβs. It is well established that the values are very different according to their disulfide bond status: the oxidized cysteines have chemical shifts of around 40.7 ppm, and the reduced cysteines, of ∼28.4 ppm (44Sharma D. Rajarathnam K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 clearly shows that Cys34 and Cys42 are in disulfide-bonded form, with their chemical shift values at 39.5 ppm and 41.6 ppm, respectively. In contrast, the Cβ of Cys65 has a chemical shift of 28.4 ppm, indicating that it is in its reduced form. The high signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra also enabled us to judge the “purity” of the cysteine status. There were no observable peaks in the 28 ppm region of Cys34 or Cys42, or in the 40 ppm region of Cys65, indicating that there is no residual free cysteine for Cys34 or Cys42 and no residual disulfide-bonded cysteine for Cys65. It should be noted that we used an unusually high concentration of L3-1 (up to 780 μm) to study the structures by NMR. With the three available cysteines, the oxidation could lead to multiple possibilities, including scrambled and/or inter-chain disulfide bonds. These nonspecific oxidations are commonly observed in high protein concentrations and oxidation conditions used in the present study. Our observation of only one type of disulfide bond is rather unusual and thus should reflect the biological relevance of this modification. Identification of the Region Affected by Oxidation—With the resonance assignments, we compared the peak positions of the HSQC spectra of the reduced and oxidized L3-1 to identify the regions with different conformations in each of the states. Most of the peaks in the center of the spectra matched pretty well, indicating that the residues corresponding to these peaks are in a similar environment in both states (see supplemental Fig. S2). The analysis showed that the unmatched or newly appearing peaks on the spectrum of the oxidized form were mostly from the residues between Cys34 and Cys42, the two disulfide-b"

The level of inorganic phosphate (Pi) elevates at the site of cartilage mineralization, and when chondrocytes were treated with Pi, they underwent rapid apoptosis. Gene silencing of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology 3-only molecule bnip3 significantly suppressed Pi-induced apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of Bcl-xL suppressed, and its knockdown promoted, the apoptosis of chondrocytes. Bnip3 was associated with Bcl-xL in chondrocytes stimulated with Pi. Bcl-xL was expressed uniformly in the growth plate chondrocytes, whereas Bnip3 expression was exclusively localized in the hypertrophic chondrocytes. Finally, we generated chondrocyte-specific bcl-x knock-out mice using the Cre-loxP recombination system, and we provided evidence that the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer was shortened in those mice because of an increased apoptosis of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, with the mice afflicted with dwarfism as a result. These results suggest the pivotal role of Bcl-2 family members in the regulation of chondrocyte apoptosis.

Endochondral ossification is an essential process for skeletal development, fracture healing, and pathologic conditions such as osteoarthritis and ectopic ossification (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). In this process, chondrocytes first proliferate and then differentiate into mature hypertrophic chondrocytes, which mineralize the surrounding matrix that is finally replaced by bone (1Kronenberg H.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). There is controversy as to the cell fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and several studies have shown that they undergo apoptosis after terminal differentiation (2Farnum C.E. Wilsman N.J. Anat. Rec. 1987; 219: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Gibson G.J. Kohler W.J. Schaffler M.B. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Hatori M.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is characterized by specific morphological and biochemical features, and is tightly regulated by extracellular stimuli and intracellular signaling pathways (5Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12927) Google Scholar). Morphologically, apoptosis is characterized by a series of structural changes in dying cells as follows: blebbing of the plasma membrane, condensation of the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and cellular fragmentation into membrane apoptotic bodies. Biochemically, apoptosis is characterized by the degradation of chromatin, initially into large fragments of 50–300 kb and subsequently into smaller fragments that are monomers and multimers of 200 bases. Not only does apoptosis regulate various aspects of the biological activity, but it also can trigger cancer, autoimmune diseases, and degenerative disorders (6Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). Several molecules such as Sox5, -6, and -9 and Runx2 have been reported to regulate proliferation and hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes (7Ikeda T. Kamekura S. Mabuchi A. Kou I. Seki S.

However, the physiologic and pathologic significance of chondrocyte apoptosis and key molecules that regulate this process remain to be elucidated. Previous studies have shown the possible involvement of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and Fas ligand, and hormones, such as glucocorticoids and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), 2The abbreviations used are: PTHrPparathyroid hormone-related peptideRTreverse transcriptioncKOconditional knock-outRNAiRNA interferenceBH3Bcr homology domain 3Zbenzyloxycarbonylfmkfluoromethyl ketoneLMlittermateBH3Bcl-2 homology 3. in the localized hypoxia and increased generation of reactive oxygen species in chondrocyte apoptosis.

Res. 2002; 17: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) reported that the terminal differentiation of chondrocytes is accompanied by marked accumulation of extracellular phosphate ions, which may lead to chondrocyte apoptosis through a plasma membrane phosphate transporter mechanism. The importance of phosphate ions in chondrocyte apoptosis was also confirmed by Demay and co-workers (14Sabbagh Y. Carpenter T.O. Demay M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9637-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), who reported that hypophosphatemia leads to impaired apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes and subsequent expansion of the late hypertrophic chondrocyte layer in vitamin D receptor-null mice, which was reversed by feeding with a high phosphate diet. Although these reports indicate that Pi entry into the cells induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, the precise molecular mechanism that results in the apoptosis of chondrocytes is still an enigma. parathyroid hormone-related peptide reverse transcription conditional knock-out RNA interference Bcr homology domain 3 benzyloxycarbonyl fluoromethyl ketone littermate Bcl-2 homology 3. There are two distinct signaling pathways of apoptosis in mammals. One is initiated by death receptors (death receptor pathways) (15Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4561) Google Scholar), and the other is regulated by anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members and involves release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm (mitochondrial pathways) (16Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar, 17Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members include mammalian Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and more than 20 pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins have been identified to date in mammals, which are divided into two groups as follows: multidomain members (Bax, Bak, Bok/Mtd, etc.) and BH3 domain-only members (Bid, Bad, Bim, Bik, Puma, Noxa, Bmf, Hrk, Bnip3, Nix, etc.) (18Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Although the BH3-only family members display tissue-specific distribution patterns, multidomain pro-apoptotic members are ubiquitously expressed, indicating that BH3-only proteins play a tissue/cell-specific and a stimulus-specific role in apoptosis and that the other members play an essential role further downstream (18Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). We report here that the balance between the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xL and the pro-apoptotic family member Bnip3 critically regulates the apoptosis of terminally differentiated chondrocytes both in vitro and in vivo. We first showed that the Bcl-xL/Bnip3 axis plays an essential role in Pi-induced chondrocyte apoptosis in vitro. Subsequently, we generated mutant mice conditionally deficient in the bcl-x gene using the Cre-loxP recombination system, and we found that the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer was shortened in these mice because of increased apoptosis. Plasmids and Viral Vectors—For the production of retrovirus, full-length cDNA of mouse bcl-xL, bcl-2, mcl-1, and bnip3 was amplified by PCR, subcloned into pCR-TOPO II vectors (Invitrogen), and inserted into pMx vectors (19Kitamura T. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 351-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The production of the retroviral vectors was performed as reported previously (20Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Briefly, Plat-E cells (2 × 106 cells) were plated in 60-mm dishes and transfected with 2 μg of pMx vector using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) on the following day. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, which was collected and used as the retroviral supernatant 48 h after the transfection. The puromycin-resistant gene and blasticidin-resistant gene were inserted into a pMx vector for the selection of stable cells. For gene silencing, RNAi sequences were designed for each of the mouse Bcl-2 family genes. Targeting sequences used were as follows: GCGTTCAGTGATCTAACATCC for Bcl-xL; GGATGCCTTTGTGGAACTATA for Bcl-2; GGACTGGCTTGTCAAACAAAG for Mcl-1; GGTAGGACAGAAACTAGAT for Bim; GGGTCAGCTATTATCTCAA for Bid; GAGCCAAACCTGACCACTA for Puma; GGTGGAGAGTTCAATTAAG for Bik; GAAGAGAAGTTGAAAGTAT for Bnip3; GGAAGAAAGTAAGTCTGAT for Nix; GGAAGGAAGCAGAATTGTA for Hrk; GCTCAAAGAAAGATGGCTT for Bmf; and GCTACGTCCAGGAGCGCACCA for green fluorescent protein. RNAi expression vectors for these genes were constructed with piGENEmU6 vector (for mouse) (iGENE Therapeutics) as described (21Miyagishi M. Taira K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 252: 483-491PubMed Google Scholar). For retrovirus expressing RNAi, the U6 promoter and inserts in piGENE vectors were cloned into pMx vectors. The adenovirus vector expressing FADDDN, which lacks the N-terminal domain that is responsible for recruiting and activating caspase-8 at the death receptor complex (22Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), was created as described previously (7Ikeda T. Kamekura S. Mabuchi A. Kou I. Seki S. Takato T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. Ikegawa S. Chung U.I. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 3561-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Adenovirus vectors expressing bacterial Cre recombinase was a generous gift from Kojiro Ueki (University of Tokyo). Adenoviruses were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified with the AdenoX virus purification kit (Clontech). Viral titers were determined by the end point dilution assay, and the viruses were used at 50 multiplicities of infection. DNA Transfection—For the gene transduction or knockdown of Bcl-2 family molecules, growth plate chondrocytes or ATDC5 cells (3 × 105 per well) were seeded onto 60-mm cell culture dishes. After 24 h, the cells were left untreated or treated with the retrovirus vectors together with Polybrene at 8 μg/ml. Thereafter, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 μg/ml of puromycin and/or 10 μg/ml of blasticidin until they became confluent. Selective overexpression or inhibition of Bcl-2 family member molecules was confirmed by real time RT-PCR or Western blotting. Cell Culture—Growth plate chondrocytes were isolated from the ribs (excluding the sternum) of C57BL6 or bcl-xfl/fl mice embryos (E18.5). About 1 × 105 cells can be obtained from one mouse. They were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). They are mainly composed of proliferating chondrocytes and were differentiated into hypertrophic chondrocytes and underwent apoptosis in the presence of Pi. Mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Saitama, Japan). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) (Sigma) with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. To induce hypertrophic differentiation, ATDC5 cells were cultured in the presence of ITS supplement (10 μg/ml bovine insulin (I), 5.5 μg/ml human transferrin (T), and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite (S)) (Sigma) for 14 days. To induce apoptosis in ATDC5 cells, the medium was changed to α-minimum Eagle's medium, 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (0.05 mm) and phosphate (NaH2PO4) at concentrations of 0–20 mm for 24–48 h. These cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. The medium was replaced every other day. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was determined by Cell Count Kit-8 (Dojindo) to count the living cells. Briefly, the cells were placed (1 ×105 cells per well) in a 96-well plate. After incubation with the indicated concentrations of Pi for 24 h, 10 μl of kit reagent was added and incubated for an additional 3 h. Cell viability was determined by scanning the samples with a microplate reader at 450 nm. Western Blotting—Western blot analysis was performed with cell extracts from growth plate chondrocytes or ATDC5 cells. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were extracted with an M-PER, NE-PER (Pierce), or ApoAlert cell fractionation kit (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were measured with a Protein Assay kit II (Bio-Rad). For Western blot analysis, lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE with 7.5–15% Tris-glycine gradient gel or 15% Tris-glycine gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 6% milk/TBS-T, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to Bcl-xL, Puma, Bik, Bid, cleaved caspase-3 and -7, cleaved lamin A (Cell Signaling Technology), Mcl-1, Hrk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Bcl-2, Bim (Pharmingen), Bnip3, Nix, Bmf, FLAG, β-actin (Sigma), cytochrome c, and Cox4 (Clontech), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in 0.2% Nonidet P-40 isotonic buffer (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 142.5 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bcl-xL antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) and separated by SDS-PAGE with a 15% Tris-glycine gradient gel. Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted with ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd.), and an aliquot (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a Takara RNA PCR kit (avian myeloblastosis virus) version 2.1 (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) to make single-stranded cDNA. PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After data collection by the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system, the mRNA copy number of a specific gene in the total RNA was calculated, and a standard curve generated with serially diluted plasmids containing PCR amplicon sequences, and normalized to rodent total RNA (Applied Biosystems) with mouse β-actin as an internal control. Standard plasmids were synthesized with a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. Primer Information—Each primer sequence of mouse target genes is described as follows: 5′-TGCAGAGGATGATTGCTGAC-3′ and 5′-GATCAGCTCGGGCACTTTAG-3′ for Bax; 5′-AGGTGACAAGTGACGGTGGT-3′ and 5′-AAGATGCTGTTGGGTTCCAG-3′ for Bak; 5′-ACATGGGGCAAGGTAGTGTC-3′ and 5′-GCTGACCACACACTTGAGGA-3′ for Bok; 5′-TTCGGTGTGATGTACCTGGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGGATGTTGTCACTGTCG-3′ for Bcl-Rambo; 5′-CAGACCCTCAGTCCAGCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGTATGAAGCCGATGGAACT-3′ for Bmf; 5′-ACAACCGCGAGCCAGGTA-3′ and 5′-CAGGGCATAGAACTCGGAAG-3′ for Bcl2l12; 5′-CGGGCAGAGCTACCACCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGCGTTTCTCTCATCACA-3′ for Noxa; 5′-CTCAGCTTGGCAGAACACAT-3′ and 5′-GCAGACACAGGTCCATCTCA-3′ for Bik; 5′-GCCCAGACATTTGGTCAGTT-3′ and 5′-TGCACACACACACAGAGGAA-3′ for Bim; 5′-CGAGCAACAGGTTAGCGAAA-3′ and 5′-TGCACAGGTACGGAATTTTG-3′ for Hrk; 5′-CCACAGCTCTCAGTCAGAAGAA-3′ and 5′-GTGTGCTCAGTCGTTTTCCA-3′ for Nix; 5′-GCCCAGCAGCACTTAGAGTC-3′ and 5′-TGTCGATGCTGCTCTTCTTG-3′ for Puma; 5′-GCTTGGGGATCTACATTGGA-3′ and 5′-TCAGGAACACCGCATTTACA-3′ for Bnip3; 5′-CTCTGCGTTCAGCTTGAGTG-3′ and 5′-CAGAAGCCCACCTACATGGT-3′ for Bid; 5′-AGGGATGGAGGAGGAGCTTA-3′ and 5′-TAGAGTTCCGGGATGTGGAG-3′ for Bad; 5′-GCCAAGACCTGAAACTCTGC-3′; and 5′-GCCATAGCTGAAGTGGAAGC-3′ for col2; 5′-CATAAAGGGCCCACTTGCTA-3′ and 5′-TGGCTGATATTCCTGGTGGT-3′ for col10; 5′-AGATGTGGATCAGCAAGCAG-3′;and 5′-GCGCAAGTTAGGTTTTGTCA-3′ for β-actin. Mice—Mice carrying the bcl-x gene with two loxP sequences at the promoter region and the second intron (bcl-xfl/fl mice) were generated as reported previously (23Rucker III, E.B. Dierisseau P. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Flaws J.A. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1038-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The mice are on a 129SvEv and C57BL6 mixed background. The presence of the floxed bcl-x gene was determined by PCR around the 5′ loxP site using the primers 5′-CGG TTGCCT AGC AAC GGG GC-3′ and 5′-CTC CCA CAG TGG AGA CCTCG-3′, giving a wild-type band of 200 bp and a floxed gene product of 300 bp. These bcl-xfl/fl mice have been used successfully to examine the role of Bcl-xL in a variety of cell types, including those in the liver, ovary, mammary gland, and substantia nigra, as well as in erythroid cells and dendritic cells (23Rucker III, E.B.

To generate chondrocyte-specific bcl-x knock-out mice, bcl-xfl/fl mice were crossed with type II collagen (Col2a1)-Cre transgenic mice, which express the Cre recombinase gene under the control of the col2a1 gene promoter (29Ovchinnikov D.A. Deng J.M. Ogunrinu G. Behringer R.R. Genesis. 2000; 26: 145-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Col2a1-Cre+/- bcl-xfl/fl (cKO), and Col2a1-Cre-/- bcl-xfl/fl (normal littermates) mice were generated by mating Col2a1-Cre+/-bcl-xfl/+ male mice with Col2a1-Cre-/- bcl-xfl/fl female mice. All animals were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and treated with humane care under approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo. Histological Analysis—Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, decalcified in 10% EDTA, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections of 5-μm thickness. Hematoxylin and eosin staining as well as von Kossa staining were performed according to the standard procedure. For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Bcl-xL (1:200; Cell Signaling Technology), Bnip3 (1:200; Sigma), COL10 (1:500; LSL) and cleaved caspase-7 (1:100; Cell Signaling Technology). The localization of the antigens was visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Promega) followed by incubation with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine according to the manufacturer's protocol. For fluorescent visualization, a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) was used. A bone radiograph of whole bodies, femurs, and tibiae was taken with a soft x-ray apparatus (SOFTEX, CMB-2, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test for the real time PCR and cell viability assay. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The results are presented as means ± S.D. Pi Induces Apoptosis of Chondrocytes through Mitochondrial Pathways—We first evaluated the effect of Pi on the viability of primary chondrocytes in vitro. When mouse primary chondrocytes were stimulated with Pi, a dose- and time-dependent increase in cell death was observed (Fig. 1A). Only about 40% of the chondrocytes survived 24 h after stimulation with 20 mm Pi. Phosphonoformic acid, which inhibits Pi entry into the cells, almost completely restored Pi-induced cell death, as reported previously (data not shown), indicating that the intracellular Pi transport stimulated chondrocyte cell death. In addition, administration of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk dose-dependently blocked cell death (Fig. 1B), indicating that Pi-induced cell death is a caspase-dependent process, i.e. apoptosis. Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that lead to hypertrophic differentiation, mineralization, and apoptosis of chondrocytes, using a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5. ATDC5 cells express markers of hypertrophic chondrocytes and mineralize the surrounding matrix under ITS treatment and subsequent Pi stimulation (30Magne D. Bluteau G. Faucheux C. Palmer G. Vignes-Colombeix C. Pilet P. Rouillon T. Caverzasio J. Weiss P. Daculsi G. Guicheux J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2003; 18: 1430-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 31Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). During ITS treatment, the expression of a chondrocyte marker type II collagen increased earlier than day 7 and remained high levels on day 14. In contrast, the expression of a hypertrophic chondrocyte marker type X collagen was low on day 7, and gradually increased thereafter, and was highly expressed on day 14 (Fig. 1C). Neither mineralization nor caspase activation was observed (Fig. 1D). After Pi stimulation, the cells underwent mineralization and apoptosis within 24 h (Fig. 1E). To examine the localization of cytochrome c in the course of the apoptosis of ATDC5 cells, we performed cell fractionation experiments. Cytochrome c was mainly detected in the mitochondrial fractions, which is positive for Cox4, before Pi stimulation, and was released into the cytoplasm in response to Pi stimulation (Fig. 1F). The differentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes are independently regulated since overexpression of ranx2 or dominant negative ranx2 did not affect Pi-induced apoptosis. Adenovirus vector-mediated introduction of dominant negative FADD (FADDDN), which blocks death receptor-initiated apoptosis, almost completely abolished tumor necrosis factor-α-induced cell death (data not shown) but did not affect Pi-induced apoptosis in ATDC5 cells (Fig. 1G). These results suggest that the mitochondrial pathway, but not the death receptor pathway, is mainly involved in the Pi-induced apoptosis of ATDC5 cells. Bcl-xL Regulates Chondrocyte Apoptosis—Because mitochondrial pathways are primarily regulated by Bcl-2 family member proteins, we next examined the expression levels and functions of Bcl-2 family molecules during the differentiation and apoptosis of chondrocytes. We first examined the effect of gain or loss of function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, on the cell viability of ATDC5 cells. Among these three molecules, Bcl-xL most efficiently suppressed Pi-induced chondrocyte apoptosis when overexpressed by retroviral vectors (Fig. 2A). Conversely, the knockdown of bcl-xL gene through RNAi efficiently reduced the cell viability compared with the knockdown of the bcl-2 or mcl-1 gene (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis revealed that cleaved caspase-7 expression was suppressed by Bcl-xL overexpression and increased by its knockdown in differentiated ATDC5 cells treated with Pi (Fig. 2, C and D). The important role of Bcl-xL was further confirmed by the experiments using primary chondrocytes obtained from bcl-xfl/fl mice. Adenovirus vector-mediated overexpression of Cre recombinase efficiently down-regulated bcl-x gene in primary chondrocytes obtained from bcl-xfl/fl mice and induced caspase-7 activation (Fig. 2E, left) in the cells, and they became apoptotic morphologically (Fig. 2E, right). These results suggest that Bcl-xL primarily maintains the viability of chondrocytes. However, the expression levels of Bcl-xL did not appear to change in the course of chondrocytic differentiation or Pi-induced apoptosis in ATDC5 cells (Fig. 2F). In addition, immunohistological examination revealed that Bcl-xL is uniformly expressed in growth plate chondrocytes (Fig. 2G). It should be noted that the expression of another antiapoptotic member Bcl-2 increased in response to Pi stimulation, suggesting an important role of the molecule in regulating chondrocyte apoptosis (Fig. 2F). However, the increased level of Bcl-2 was not enough to suppress Pi-induced apoptosis of ATDC5 cell. Bnip3, a Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 Family Member Protein, Promotes the Pi-induced Apoptosis of Chondrocytes—The fact that the expression level of Bcl-xL was not affected by Pi stimulation and that Bcl-xL is uniformly expressed in the chondrocyte layers prompted us to investigate the role of pro-apoptotic molecule(s) that may inhibit the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL. Among 15 pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, six molecules (Puma, Bid, Hrk, Bnip3, Bad, and Nix) increased in expression level during the course of hypertrophic differentiation (Fig. 3A), and two of them (Bnip3 and Bmf) in response to Pi stimulation (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, gene silencing of the proapoptotic BH3-only molecule bnip3 significantly suppressed Pi-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis revealed that the protein levels of Bnip3 increased in response to Pi stimulation, followed by caspase-7 activation (Fig. 3D). Immunohistological examination of murine growth plates revealed that Bnip3 expression was exclusively localized in the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic layers of chondrocytes (Fig. 3E). Although overexpression of Bnip3 increased Pi-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, its overexpression alone failed to induce chondrocyte apoptosis in the absence of Pi (data not shown). Bnip3 Associates with Bcl-xL and Attenuates the Anti-apoptotic Effect of Bcl-xL on Chondrocytes—We then investigated the molecular interaction between Bcl-xL and Bnip3 in chondrocytes. Earlier studies have shown that Bnip3 heterodimerizes with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and facilitates cell death via mitochondrial pathways (32Ray R. Chen G. Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Park J.H. Reed J.C. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1439-1448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, Bnip3 was co-immunoprecipitated with Bcl-xL in Pi-treated chondrocytes. The susceptibility to apoptosis by bcl-xL knockdown was partially restored by simultaneous silencing of bnip3 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, overexpression of Bnip3 promoted Pi-induced cell death, which was almost completely rescued by the simultaneous transduction of Bcl-xL but not by that of Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, Bnip3 is up-regulated and associates with Bcl-xL in chondrocytes in response to Pi stimulation, impairs the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-xL, and consequently causes apoptosis in these cells. Chondrocyte-specific Bcl-x Knock-out Mice Exhibit a Reduction in the Hypertrophic Layer of Growth Plate Chondrocytes—To further confirm the essential role of the Bcl-xL/Bnip3 axis in chondrocytes, we generated chondrocyte-specific conditional knock-out (cKO) mice of the bcl-x gene by mating bcl-xfl/fl mice with Col2a1-Cre transgenic mice, in which Cre recombinase is specifically expressed in chondrocytes under the control of the col2a1 promoter. The cKO mice (Col2a1-Cre+/- bcl-xfl/fl mice) were born at approximately a Mendelian frequency. Bcl-xL expression was markedly reduced in chondrocytes of the cKO mice, whereas its expression in othe"
https://openalex.org/W1978580063,"Hsp70 escort proteins (Hep) have been implicated as essential for maintaining the function of yeast mitochondrial hsp70 molecular chaperones (mtHsp70), but the role that escort proteins play in regulating mammalian chaperone folding and function has not been established. We present evidence that human mtHsp70 exhibits limited solubility due to aggregation mediated by its ATPase domain and show that human Hep directly enhances chaperone solubility through interactions with this domain. In the absence of Hep, mtHsp70 was insoluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, as was its isolated ATPase domain and a chimera having this domain fused to the peptide-binding domain of HscA, a soluble monomeric chaperone. In contrast, these proteins all exhibited increased solubility when expressed in the presence of Hep. In vitro studies further revealed that purified Hep regulates the interaction of mtHsp70 with nucleotides. Full-length mtHsp70 exhibited slow intrinsic ATP hydrolysis activity (6.8+/-0.2 x 10(-4) s(-1)) at 25 degrees C, which was stimulated up to 49-fold by Hep. Hep also stimulated the activity of the isolated ATPase domain, albeit to a lower maximal extent (11.5-fold). In addition, gel-filtration studies showed that formation of chaperone-escort protein complexes inhibited mtHsp70 self-association, and they revealed that Hep binding to full-length mtHsp70 and its isolated ATPase domain is strongest in the absence of nucleotides. These findings provide evidence that metazoan escort proteins regulate the catalytic activity and solubility of their cognate chaperones, and they indicate that both forms of regulation arise from interactions with the mtHsp70 ATPase domain."
https://openalex.org/W2018830790,"A critical step in understanding the mode of action of insecticidal crystal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis is their partitioning into membranes and, in particular, the insertion of the toxin into insect brush border membranes. The Umbrella and Penknife models predict that only α-helix 5 of domain I along with adjacent helices α-4 or α-6 insert into the brush border membranes because of their hydrophobic nature. By employing fluorescent-labeled cysteine mutations, we observe that all three domains of the toxin insert into the insect membrane. Using proteinase K protection assays, steady state fluorescence quenching measurements, and blue shift analysis of acrylodan-labeled cysteine mutants, we show that regions beyond those proposed by the two models insert into the membrane. Based on our studies, the only extended region that does not partition into the membrane is that of α-helix 1. Bioassays and voltage clamping studies show that all mutations examined, except certain domain II mutations in loop 2 (e.g. F371C and G374C), which disrupt membrane partitioning, retain their ability to form ion channels and toxicity in Manduca sexta larvae. This study confirms our earlier hypothesis that insertion of crystal toxin does not occur as separate helices alone, but virtually the entire molecule inserts as one or more units of the whole molecule.

Insecticidal crystal proteins produced by Bacillus thuringiensis are of great commercial potential in the field of agriculture and health (1Schnepf E. Crickmore N. VanRie J. Lereclus D. Baum J.

Cry1A toxins are active against lepidopteran insects, which include agricultural pests. The toxins are produced by the bacterium in the stationary phase as inactive crystal protoxins (1Schnepf E.

Activation of the 130-kDa protoxin to a 65-kDa active toxin occurs in the alkaline environment of the lepidopteran midgut. Crystal structures of the active toxin show that the toxin has three domains that are conserved through all the crystal toxins (2Grochulski P. Masson L. Borisova S. Pusztai-Carey M. Schwartz J.-L.

Adv. Insect. Physiol. 1994; 24: 275-308Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar). There has been little analysis of the other regions of the toxin.

Biochemical protease protection assay and steady state fluorescence measurements using cysteine mutations in regions of three domains of Cry1Aa or Cry1Ab toxin show that all regions of the toxin studied except α-helix 1 are embedded into the membrane, although to different extents.

Dean D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2276-2282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primers for site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from either Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., or Bioneer Inc. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using mutagene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit as described in the manufacturer's manual (Bio-Rad). Mutations were confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing performed at the Plant Microbe Genomics Facility, Ohio State University, Columbus.Expression and Purification of the Toxin Mutants—Expression and preparation of the toxin were carried out as described earlier (24Lee M.K. Milne R.E. Ge A.Z. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3115-3121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystals were solubilized in 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.5, buffer to extract the protoxin and digested with 1:50 w/w of trypsin/crystal protein to yield the activated toxin. The toxins were purified using Sepharose Q ion exchange column and Sephacryl S300 and Superdex S200 gel filtration columns in series.Preparation of Small Unilamellar Vesicles—Artificial phospholipids, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phophatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol (Avanti Polar lipids Inc.), used in the molar ratio of 7:2:1, similar in composition to lipids commonly in bilayer and vesicle formation of crystal toxins (2Grochulski P.

Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from a preparation of large multilamellar vesicles by using a Branson 2200 bath sonicator. The large multilamellar vesicle mixture free of any chloroform was sonicated in the water bath for 10-min intervals during which the solution turned less opaque. The size class of the SUV was measured on a DynaPro light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technologies.). SUV gave an average size range of 25–30 nm, which was reproducible from batch to batch analysis. Typical size ranges of SUV vary from 15 to 50 nm when obtained using this protocol (27Pitcher III, W.H. Huestis W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1352-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Preparation of Brush Border Membrane Vesicles (BBMV)—Fourth instar larvae of Manduca sexta (Carolina Biologicals Supply Co.) were dissected using procedures described elsewhere (28Liebig B. Stetson D.L. Dean D.H. J. Insect Physiol. 1995; 41: 17-22Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). BBMV were prepared using modified a differential magnesium precipitation method (29Wolfersberger M.

The final BBMV pellet was resuspended in a binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were estimated using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce).Proteinase K Protection Assays—Pure toxin was mixed with 10-fold excess of BBMV and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min after which proteinase K at 10-fold excess concentration of the toxin was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to stop the reaction. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, then solubilized into 1% n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Sigma), and boiled for 3–5 min before loading onto an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted using polyclonal anti-Cry1A rabbit antisera at a dilution of 1 in 10,000 and horseradish peroxidase-tagged goat anti-rabbit antisera at a dilution of 1 in 50,000 (Bio-Rad). Blots were visualized using chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate (Bio-Rad).

Purified cysteine mutants were incubated with 10-fold molar excess of the probes and incubated in the dark overnight. Unbound label was removed using Sephadex G-50 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Purity of the protein was checked on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the efficiency of labeling was measured using the molar extinction coefficient of each probe.Steady State Fluorescence Quenching Measurements—50 μg of 1,5-IAEDANS-labeled Cry1A toxin was mixed with 5 mg of SUV and incubated for 60 min. The bound toxin was separated from the unbound labeled toxin by passing the sample through a Sephadex G-100 column (GE Healthcare). Concentration of the SUV-bound protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) after delipidation of the proteins using a clean up kit (Pierce). Steady state fluorescence measurements of equal amounts of free and bound toxin were carried out in a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (JY Horiba). The sample was excited at a wavelength of 380 nm, and emission scan showed maximum fluorescence around 460 nm. The SUV-bound labeled toxin was treated with increasing aliquots of potassium iodide (KI) in thiosulfate (final concentration of 0.83 m) to test if the label on the bound toxin was further susceptible to collisional quenching in the aqueous environment. The percentage of quenching of fluorophore was calculated as the percentage ratio of the difference in the quantum yield before and after partitioning of the labeled protein to the total fluorescence of that free labeled protein in buffer.Fluorescence “Blue Shift” Measurements—Acrylodan-labeled Cry1A toxin (50 μg) was treated with BBMV (500 μg) and incubated for 60 min. The bound toxin was separated from the unbound by centrifuging the sample at 15,000 × g. Proteinase K (500 μg) was added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 30 min. The sample was centrifuged again at 15,000 × g, and the resultant pellet was resuspended in binding buffer. Steady state fluorescence measurements of the labeled toxin, bound toxin before and after proteinase K treatment were carried out on Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter (JY Horiba). The samples were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorophore emission was read from 390 to 650 nm. Maximal emission wavelengths (λmax) of fluorescence of labeled toxin and toxin bound to BBMV before and after proteinase K treatment were recorded for each mutant. Each experiment was reproduced three times, and the average value of the λmax was recorded.Toxicity Bioassays—Toxicity levels were determined by estimating the median lethal concentration (LC50) on M. sexta larvae using the diet surface contamination assay (24Lee M.K. Milne R.E. Ge A.Z. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3115-3121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sixteen first instar larvae were used for each concentration of the toxin, and a total of six concentrations of each toxin were used. Mortalities were recorded after 5 days. The LC50 for each toxin was calculated by probit analysis using SoftTox (WindowsChem Software, Inc.).Voltage Clamp Measurements of Cry1A Mutants—Inhibition of short circuit currents (Isc) was measured by clamping M. sexta midguts using procedures described earlier (28Liebig B. Stetson D.L. Dean D.H. J. Insect Physiol. 1995; 41: 17-22Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of purified proteins were added to the lumen side of the gut stabilized in the buffer (30Chamberlin M.E. Physiol. Zool. 1994; 67: 82-94Crossref Google Scholar). Measurements were made on a DVC 1000 voltage/current clamp (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) connected to MacLab-4 (AD Instruments, Mountainview, CA). Data analysis was done using SigmaPlot version 10 (Systat Software Inc., Richmond, CA). The data were normalized to scale the percentage of short circuit current remaining. The slope of the linear region was used to measure the rate of ion transport in case of each mutant, and the lag time (T0) was also calculated as a measure of the rate of partitioning of the toxins into BBMV (28Liebig B.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4886) Google Scholar) where uracil-rich single-stranded templates were annealed to primers and elongated in the presence of T7 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase. The resulting products were transformed into DH5α cells (containing dUT-Pase) and screened for mutants. Proteins were expressed in DH5α cells under a “leaky” promoter. The resulting protoxins were run on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to obtain a 130-kDa band (data not shown). Expressed proteins were digested with trypsin to yield an active 65-kDa form that was purified using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The secondary structures of the mutants were compared with the wild type using a circular dichroism spectrophotometer. Only mutations with good expression level and whose secondary structure was not affected upon expression, as measured by circular dichroism, were used in this study. They are L40C, V171C, S191C, L199C, L215C, S279C, S324C, S364C, and F371C from Cry1Ab and D62C, E460C, K489C, and I526C from Cry1Aa. The mutations used span all the three domains of the toxin, and most of the chosen residues are conserved across Cry1Aa and Cry1Ab. Each purified toxin mutant (100 ng) used for the proteinase K protection assay has been blotted using anti Cry1A antibody as shown in Fig. 1. All Cry1A toxins in our hand produced a doublet band on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1, C and D) upon purification from the crystals. Sequence analysis of the bands have shown that the doublet was a result of multiple trypsin sites at the C terminus of the active toxin close to each other and resulting from incomplete digestion of all molecules. We loaded 100 ng of toxin in Fig. 1 to indicate multiple bands in the Western blot.Toxicity of Mutants—Biological activity of each mutant toxin was compared with that of the activity of the wild type toxins using a surface contamination method against first instar M. sexta larvae. The activity is reported as an LC50 value (concentration of the toxin required to kill 50% of the larvae) shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Bioassay measurements of Cry1A toxins and their mutants on first instar larvae of M. sexta using surface contamination methodToxin/mutant WT/domain ILC50Toxin/mutant domains II and IIILC50ng/cm2ng/cm2Cry1Aa16.0 (8.0-25.3)S279C22.0 (8.2-35.6)Cry1Ab20.0 (7.5-31.7)S324C19.8 (7.5-32.2)L40C20.0 (7.0-33.4)S364C25.6 (11.2-40.2)D62C12.0 (4-20.2)F371C>2000aLC50 values for mutants are as cited in Refs. 23, 35.V 171C20.0aLC50 values for mutants are as cited in Refs. 23, 35.

Open table in a new tab Proteinase K Protection Assays—To test if the mutant toxin has retained the ability to insert into M. sexta BBMV, we digested the toxin bound to BBMV with proteinase K, a nonspecific protease. Western blot analyses show that even after treatment with 10-fold excess of proteinase K for 30 min, most of the mutants have retained an ∼60-kDa form of the toxin (Fig. 2). For the domain II residue Phe-371, its mutation to tryptophan protected it from the protease; however, its mutation to cysteine did not protect it. The effects of mutating Phe-371 on insertion of the toxin have been published. Phe-371 is a residue that has been studied for its ability to mediate insertion of the toxin into the membrane. The partitioning rate of every mutant into the brush border membrane and artificial membranes are not the same. We have seen that mutagenesis of Phe-371 to other residues in decreasing order of hydrophobicity have compromised its insertion ability (31Arnold S. Curtiss A. Dean D.H. Alzate O. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Rajamohan F. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2390-2397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although mutation to Trp retained most of the toxicity of the toxin in these studies, the difference in the amount protected for this mutant (Fig. 2B) could be due to the ability of the toxin to partition only at a slower rate than wild type, for a fixed amount of time given for the toxin-membrane interaction in this assay. For mutations other than that to Trp, we see further decrease in insertion rate based on ion channel-forming abilities like voltage clamp studies and binding studies to BBMV (34Rajamohan F. Cotrill J.A. Gould F. Dean D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2390-2397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). F371C was the most affected in these studies, and using the thiol probe acrylodan, it was shown that this mutation was completely ineffective in partitioning into brush border membranes (35Nair M.S. Liu X.S. Dean D.H. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 5814-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Labeling Cry1A Mutants with Fluorophore—Purified cysteine mutants were labeled with acrylodan or IAEDANS and purified off free labels using gel filtration. The labeling efficiency was measured with each fluorophore and was found to be 95 ± 0.3% for acrylodan and 99 ± 0.5% for IAEDANS using their respective extinction coefficients. Circular dichroism analyses of the labeled mutants showed no variations in the spectra in the region of 200–250 nm indicating that the secondary structure has been retained upon labeling with either fluorophore (data not shown).Quenching Analysis of Labeled Mutants in Artificial Vesicles—Using artificial SUV made of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phophatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol, the percentage of quenching of each cysteine mutant labeled to a fluorophore of the aminonaphthalene sulfonate family, IAEDANS, upon partitioning into the vesicles was measured. The IAEDANS fluorophore has a very high dipole moment and hence increased quantum yield of emission in an aqueous environment that gets quenched inside the SUV. Thus upon partitioning of the toxin into SUV, the fluorescence emission of IAEDANS is quenched. The percentage of quenching for each of the mutants in our study has been reported in Fig. 3. Results show that mutants in domain I (D62C, V171C, L199C, and L215C), domain II (S279C, S324C, and S364C), and domain III (K489C and I526C) all have about 50% or more of fluorescence quenched inside the SUV, whereas residues L40C and S191C in domain I have less than 50% quenching. Only F371C has almost no quenching into SUVs. Addition of KI solution to a final concentration of 0.83 m quenched the fluorescence of labeled toxin in buffer completely at the volumes used, but when mixed with the SUV-bound labeled toxins, there was no further quenching of the already quenched fluorescence of the vesicle-bound label, indicating that the hydrophilic collisional quencher was not able to access the label in the SUV-bound form.FIGURE 3Percentage of quenching of fluorescence of 1,5-IAEDANS-tagged cysteine mutants calculated as (IIaq – ISUV)/Iaq, where Iaq is the quantum yield of fluorescence of the labeled mutants in aqueous buffer, and ISUV is the quantum yield of fluorescence of the labeled mutants in SUV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)“Blue Shift” Measurements of Acrylodan-labeled Mutants—Acrylodan is an environment-sensitive fluorophore that reacts with thiol groups of cysteines to form a covalent conjugate. Depending on the environment of the thiol group, there is a variation in the fluorescence emission from the molecule. Emission of the probe is low and at longer wavelengths (around 500 nm) in aqueous environments, whereas in a lipid environment like that of the BBMV, the emission occurs at much shorter wavelengths (around 460 nm). Emission from acrylodan-tagged mutants is dependent on its dipole moment, and is therefore different for different mutants depending on the exposure of the residue to the aqueous environment.All our mutants, when tagged with the fluorophore, showed a maximal emission wavelength in aqueous environment around 480–500 nm. Upon binding to BBMV, the maximal emission wavelength shifted to a shorter wavelength for all of them, the extent of which was different for each mutant. This blue shift was retained for all the mutants even after treating the BBMV-bound labeled toxins with 100-fold excess of proteinase K. A–C in Fig. 5 are a representative spectra of mutants in domain I, II, and III, respectively, indicating the wavelength shift from longer to shorter wavelength under different environments for the label. The extent of blue shift was not the same before and after proteinase K treatment as indicated in Fig. 4. All these mutants were accompanied by an increase in the intensity of acrylodan fluorescence as seen in case of the representative spectra (Fig. 5, A–C). The only exceptions to this were Cry1Ab L40C, which showed decrease in its fluorescence emission (Fig. 5D), and Cry1Ab F371C, which block the protein from partitioning into the membrane (35Nair M.S.

YidC is essential for all anaerobic growth conditions tested, and this is not because of the decreased levels of F1F0-ATP synthase in the inner membrane only. The results suggest a role for YidC in the membrane biogenesis of integral membrane parts of the anaerobic respiratory chain. In Escherichia coli about 30% of all encoded proteins are located in the inner and outer membranes. The cytoplasmic or inner membrane contains essential energy-transducing complexes such as components of the electron transport chain, as well as solute transporters. Most integral inner membrane proteins are inserted co-translationally via the general secretory pathway otherwise known as the Sec system. In this pathway ribosome-bound nascent chains are targeted by the bacterial signal recognition particle to the SecYEG translocase via the signal recognition particle receptor FtsY. The membrane insertion of these proteins proceeds by a co-translational “threading mechanism” (1.de Gier J.W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in which the accessory protein YidC might play an important role in the clearance of transmembrane segments (TMSs) 2The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; PMF, proton motive force; IMV, inner membrane vesicle. from the SecYEG channel (2.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A small subset of integral membrane proteins are targeted directly to YidC where they are integrated into the membrane in a Sec-independent manner. YidC belongs to the evolutionarily conserved Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family. Oxa1 (oxidase assembly) from yeast was the first member of this family to be described. It was originally identified as an essential factor for the biogenesis of respiratory complexes in the mitochondrion (3.Bauer M. Behrens M. Esser K. Michaelis G. Pratje E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 4.Bonnefoy N. Chalvet F. Hamel P. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), more specifically the insertion of subunits of the cytochrome bc1 oxidase and ATP synthase. Alb3 is located in the thylakoid membranes of Arabidopsis chloroplasts (5.Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and is involved in the biogenesis of light-harvesting complexes. Members of the family have all been implicated in membrane protein biogenesis of respiratory and energy-transducing proteins. In E. coli it has been shown that YidC is essential for the insertion of subunit c of the F1F0-ATP synthase (Foc) (6.van der Laan M. Bechtluft P. Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and subunit a of cytochrome o oxidase (CyoA) (7.du Plessis D.J. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12248-12252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8.van Bloois E. Haan G.J. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10002-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the effect of YidC depletion on the insertion of respiratory proteins has been studied in aerobically grown E. coli cells, the same has not been done for anaerobically grown cells. In the absence of oxygen, E. coli is able to use other organic (fermentation) and inorganic (anaerobic respiration) molecules as terminal electron acceptors. Nitrate is commonly used as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen, and the protein complex nitrate reductase (NarGHI) replaces the cytochrome o oxidase. The α and β subunits, NarG and NarH, respectively, are located in the cytoplasm and attach to the membrane via the γ subunit NarI to form the nitrate reductase complex (9.Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). E. coli can also use fumarate as a terminal electron acceptor. The structure of fumarate reductase (FrdABCD) is similar to that of nitrate reductase except that the integral membrane part consists of two smaller subunits, namely FrdC and -D (10.Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although another translocation pathway, the Tat system (Twin Arginine Translocation), has been shown to target the peripheral αβ subcomplex to the integral membrane γ subunit of some anaerobic respiratory complexes, for example the DMSO reductase (DmsABC) (11.Sambasivarao D. Dawson H.A. Zhang G. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20167-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), this is not the case for all terminal reductases such as the fumarate reductase (11.Sambasivarao D. Dawson H.A. Zhang G. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20167-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Also, how the integral membrane γ subunits of these complexes are inserted into the membrane is not known. In E. coli only three natural substrates of YidC have been identified, namely Foc, CyoA, and more recently the ion channel MscL (12.Facey S.J. Neugebauer S.A. Krauss S. Kuhn A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The identification of additional inner membrane proteins, which rely solely on YidC for their insertion, would give insight into the insertion mechanism of YidC and a possible evolutionarily conserved function of the Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family. The aim of this study was to investigate whether YidC plays a role in the membrane biogenesis of anaerobic respiratory complexes, i.e. the complexes essential for growth when either nitrate or fumarate is used as a terminal electron acceptor or under fermentative conditions. Our data demonstrate that YidC is essential for all growth conditions tested and that this is not only because of decreased levels of F1F0-ATP synthase in the inner membrane. The results suggest a role for YidC in the membrane biogenesis of integral membrane subunits of the anaerobic respiratory chain. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The YidC depletion strain E. coli FTL10 (MC4100-A, ΔyidC, attB::(araC+, PBAD, yidC+) KanR) (13.Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was a generous gift of Frank Sargent (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK). Strains E. coli SF100 (F–lacX74 galE galK thi rpsL (strA) ΔphoA(pvuII), ΔompT) and NN100 (SF100, lpp D(uncB-C) zid::Tn10) (14.Nouwen N. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were used to test dependence of anaerobically grown cells on the F1F0-ATPase. Plasmid pTrc99A (15.Amann E. Brosius J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was used to construct plasmid pET589 containing E. coli yidC (16.Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 1397-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). E. coli FTL10 was transformed with plasmids pTrc99A and pET589 to construct “YidC–” and “YidC+” depletion strains when grown on glucose-containing media. Materials—Potassium nitrate was purchased from Fluka, and zinc powder, lapachol, and sodium fumarate were from Sigma. Texas Red was purchased from Invitrogen. Antiserum against YidC was raised in chickens against purified His-tagged YidC (Agrisera AB, Sweden). Antisera against fumarate reductase subunits FrdA and FrdB, the nitrate reductase complex (NarGHI), subunit c of the F1F0-ATP synthase (Foc), leader peptidase (LepB), phage shock protein A (PspA), and subunit K of the NADH dehydrogenase I (NuoK) were generous gifts from Joel Weiner (University of Alberta, Canada), Axel Magalon (LCB-IBSM CNRS, Marseille, France), Gabriele Deckers-Hebestreit (University of Osnabruckç Germany), Jan Tommassen (Utrecht University, The Netherlands), William Wickner (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), and Takao Yagi (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), respectively. The d-glucose HK assay kit was purchased from Megazyme and the nitrate test from Merck. Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer was purchased from Pierce. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-chicken, anti-mouse, and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Growth and Processing—Cells were grown anaerobically at 37 °C on basal anaerobic growth medium supplemented with 0.1% yeast extract (Difco) as described previously (17.Lester R.L. DeMoss J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following carbon sources, electron acceptors, and trace metals were added as indicated: 0.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) potassium nitrate, 10 mm sodium fumarate, 1 μm sodium selenite, and 1 μm sodium molybdate. Sodium selenite and sodium molybdate were only added when potassium nitrate was used an electron acceptor. To deplete cells of YidC, E. coli FTL10 harboring either plasmid pET589 (“YidC+”) or pTrc99A (“YidC–”) was grown aerobically at 37 °C overnight in basal anaerobic growth medium containing 0.5% arabinose. Cells were then harvested, washed in basal anaerobic growth medium, and resuspended in basal anaerobic growth medium containing glucose or glycerol and potassium nitrate or sodium fumarate as indicated, and growth was continued to an A660 of 0.6. This corresponds to late exponential phase. The cells were then diluted 2-fold with the same medium, and the procedure was repeated until the cessation of the YidC– strain (adapted from Ref. 28.Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) were prepared from these cells as described previously (18.Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K. Driessen A.J. van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All further analysis was performed using these IMVs. The glucose and nitrate contents of the growth media were assayed after growth in the second dilution in centrifuge-cleared supernatant. E. coli strains SF100 and NN100 were first grown overnight aerobically in basal anaerobic growth medium containing glucose. The cells were then washed in basal anaerobic growth medium and inoculated into the same medium containing the combinations of carbon sources, electron acceptors, and trace metals used under YidC-depleting conditions. The A660 was measured after 8 h of growth at 37 °C under anaerobic conditions. Protein Determination and Western Blotting—Protein concentrations were determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were carried out according to methods previously described (19.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207539) Google Scholar, 20.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Gels for immunoblot analyses were loaded with equal amounts of total inner membrane protein. Signal capture and quantification were performed using LumiAnalyst 3.1 (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblot analyses were repeated at least in triplicate in independent experiments. Enzyme Assays—ATPase activity of IMVs was measured at 4 °C using malachite green as described (21.Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). Nitrate reductase and fumarate reductase activities of IMVs were measured spectrophotometrically at 25 °C using a Hitachi U-1100 spectrophotometer. The activities were measured by following the oxidation of reduced lapachol at 481 nm in the presence of nitrate or fumarate (22.Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed in an anaerobic cuvette with a rubber stopper under nitrogen. The extinction coefficient of lapachol was taken to be 2.66 mm–1cm–1, and specific activity was expressed as nanomoles of nitrate or fumarate reduced per min/mg of IMV. Translocation Assay—The presence of a functional Sec translocase was verified with IMVs using Texas Red-labeled proOmpA as a substrate (23.van der Laan M. Houben E.N. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Proteinase K was added after the translocation reaction to digest any untranslocated material. Depletion of YidC Leads to the Cessation of Growth under Anaerobic Conditions—To examine if YidC is needed for protein biogenesis of respiratory and energy transduction proteins expressed under anaerobic conditions, we examined the growth of E. coli FTL10 (13.Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) under anaerobic conditions in the presence of various electron acceptors and carbon sources. Cells harboring either pET589 (YidC+) or pTrc99A (YidC–) were grown as described under “Experimental Procedures” until the cessation of the YidC– strain (adapted from Ref. 28.Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The following combinations of electron acceptors and carbon sources were used: glucose only; nitrate and glycerol; nitrate and glucose; fumarate and glycerol; fumarate and glucose. Under YidC–-depleting conditions, the YidC– strain ceased to grow under all conditions tested (Table 1). An aliquot of growth medium was sampled once cells had reached an absorbance of 0.6 after the cells had been diluted once, cleared of cells by centrifugation, and assayed for d-glucose and nitrate. This confirmed that the cells were utilizing the glucose and nitrate in the growth medium (data not shown).TABLE 1Growth media used and stage at which the growth of the YidC– strain ceasedGrowth conditionsCarbon sourceElectron acceptorDilutions before growth ceasedaYidC- cells were grown anaerobically in the presence of the indicated carbon source and electron acceptor to an A660 of 0.6 and diluted 2-fold with fresh medium, and the procedure was repeated until the cessation of the YidC- strain as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Glucose5GlycerolNitrate3GlucoseNitrate4-5GlycerolFumarate3GlucoseFumarate4a YidC- cells were grown anaerobically in the presence of the indicated carbon source and electron acceptor to an A660 of 0.6 and diluted 2-fold with fresh medium, and the procedure was repeated until the cessation of the YidC- strain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Inner Membrane Protein Profile Is Largely Unchanged following YidC Depletion—Examination of the inner membrane protein profile revealed that few changes occurred upon YidC depletion (supplemental Fig. 1A). The levels of the inner membrane protein leader peptidase (LepB), which is not strictly dependent on YidC for its insertion, are unaffected by YidC depletion as examined by immunoblot analysis (supplemental Fig. 1B). The levels of YidC were monitored by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against YidC. The intensity of the bands present on the immunoblots against YidC were quantified, and the blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against LepB, which was used as a control membrane protein. The intensity of the bands of YidC were then expressed as the ratio of the YidC and the LepB bands to compare relative levels of YidC in the membrane (Fig. 1A). This process was repeated for all immunoblots in the study. This showed that the levels of YidC in IMVs isolated from strains grown in the same growth medium for a comparable amount of time decrease substantially in the YidC– strains. Sec Translocon Is Not Affected by YidC Depletion in E. coli FTL10—There are many reports in the literature that show that YidC depletion does not affect the translocation of proteins via the Sec translocon or the Tat pathway (13.Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24.Yi L. Jiang F. Chen M. Cain B. Bolhuis A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10537-10544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Using IMVs isolated from anaerobically glucose-grown cells, the translocation of Texas Red-labeled proOmpA still occurred in YidC– IMVs (supplemental Fig. 1C). The processing of proOmpA is reduced, however, which can mostly be attributed to a disturbance of the proton motive force (PMF) because a similar effect is seen when the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin are added. No protection of Texas Red-labeled proOmpA from the externally added protease was observed when ATP is absent. These data confirm for anaerobically grown cells that the YidC– depletion does not affect the levels of the functional Sec translocon. Depletion of YidC Interferes with the Membrane Assembly of Foc—Subunit c of the Foc is a well studied substrate of YidC. The levels of Foc in IMVs were found to decrease upon YidC depletion under all anaerobic growth conditions tested (Fig. 1B). The total ATPase activities of IMVs were tested to confirm that the F1F0-ATP synthase was indeed not fully functional. It has been shown that 95% of the total ATPase activity of wild type IMVs can be attributed to the F1F0-ATP synthase. 3M. van de Laan, unpublished data. Under YidC-depleting conditions, the ATPase activity of YidC– IMVs isolated from cells under all growth conditions is reduced with respect to the YidC+ IMVs (Fig. 1C). The reduction in ATPase activity after YidC depletion was greater among cells grown in combination with nitrate or fumarate and glucose than those where glycerol was the carbon source. Upon YidC Depletion, Induction of PspA Is Reduced in Anaerobically Grown Cells Compared with Aerobically Grown Ones—In aerobically grown E. coli cells, YidC depletion leads to a massive up-regulation of the Psp (phage shock protein) operon. This can be monitored by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against the membrane-associated PspA protein. We found that upon YidC depletion under anaerobic growth conditions, the PspA induction was greatly reduced when compared with that seen under aerobic growth conditions (Fig. 2). Growth Defect following YidC Depletion Is Not Only Because of the Decrease of Functional F1F0-ATP Synthase in the Membrane—To test whether the cessation of growth under YidC-depleting conditions observed under anaerobic conditions can be attributed to the decrease in the levels of functional F1F0-ATP synthase in the membrane, E. coli NN100 and SF100 strains were grown in the same growth medium examined under YidC-depleting conditions. E. coli strain NN100 is a derivative of strain SF100 and contains a deletion of the uncB-C genes resulting in a strain with no functional F1F0-ATP synthase (14.Nouwen N. van der Laan M. Driessen A.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were grown anaerobically at 37 °C, and the absorbance was measured after 8 h of growth (Fig. 3). As expected, the growth of NN100 cells in medium containing only glucose was severely impaired. These cells were, however, able to grow anaerobically in all other growth medium tested. The presence of the F1F0-ATP synthase is therefore essential only under fermentative conditions and not needed for anaerobic growth with the electron acceptors tested. Growth with nitrate as the electron acceptor of NN100 reached a higher absorbance than SF100 cells grown under the same conditions, suggesting that a partial dissipation of the PMF occurs in the presence of a functional F1F0-ATP synthase that reduces the growth. Activity and Protein Levels of Nitrate Reductase in Membranes Decreases upon YidC Depletion—Because the decreased levels of functional F1F0-ATP synthase in the membrane are not responsible for the cessation of growth observed, the depletion of YidC must affect the assembly of some other membrane-located complex(es) needed for anaerobic respiration when nitrate or fumarate are the electron acceptors, and/or other essential membrane-localized functions. We therefore investigated the protein levels and enzyme activities of other membrane-located complexes essential for growth when nitrate or fumarate are the electron acceptors, namely the nitrate and fumarate reductases and the NADH dehydrogenase I. In the absence of oxygen, E. coli can use alternative electron acceptors to form an electron transport chain. In the presence of selenium, molybdenum, and high levels of nitrate, the expression of the nitrate reductase containing operon narGHIJ is induced rather than napFDAGHBC (26.Potter L.C. Millington P. Griffiths L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against the entire complex, immunoblot analysis revealed that the levels of NarGHI decrease upon YidC depletion (Fig. 4A). The activity of the nitrate reductase was also assayed by the oxidation of a hydroxylated naphthoquinol menaquinol analogue, reduced lapachol, under anaerobic conditions. Under YidC-depleting conditions the reduction of nitrate by IMVs is reduced (Table 2). The activity of nitrate reductase was higher in IMVs isolated from nitrate/glycerol-grown cells in comparison with nitrate/glucose-grown cells. For nitrate/glycerol-grown cells, nitrate reductase activity was 2.4-fold reduced in the YidC– strain, and for nitrate/glucose-grown cells the reduction was greater, 3.5-fold.TABLE 2Activity of the nitrate and fumarate reductases as assayed by lapachol oxidation of IMVs in the presence of electron acceptors nitrate or fumarateGrowth conditionsElectron acceptorCarbon sourceYidCEnzyme activitynmol/min/mg of membrane proteinaEnzyme activities are expressed as nanomoles of nitrate or fumarate reduced per min per mg of IMV.

Open table in a new tab Activity and Protein Levels of Fumarate Reductase in Membranes Decreases upon YidC Depletion—Using the same strategy as for the nitrate reductase complex, the effect of YidC depletion on another membrane-located terminal reductase, fumarate reductase, was examined. Immunoblot analysis of IMVs was carried out using antibodies directed against the α and β subunits of the reductase (FrdA and -B, respectively) (Fig. 4B). The data show that the levels of FrdA and FrdB decrease upon YidC depletion. Also, fumarate reductase activity of IMVs as assayed by the oxidation of reduced lapachol was found to decrease upon YidC depletion (Table 2). As with nitrate reductase, the activity of fumarate reductase was higher in IMVs isolated from fumarate/glycerol-grown cells in comparison with fumarate/glucose-grown cells. For fumarate/glycerol-grown cells, fumarate reductase activity was 1.7-fold reduced in the YidC– strain, and for fumarate/glucose-grown cells, the reduction was greater, 2.8-fold. Protein Levels of the NADH Dehydrogenase I Subunit K—A knockdown of the human Oxa1l in HEK293 cells results in a reduced activity and protein content of the F1F0-ATP synthase and complex I, the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (27.Stiburek L. Fornuskova D. Wenchich L. Pejznochova M. Hansikova H. Zeman J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). E. coli expresses two types of NADH dehydrogenases. NADH dehydrogenase I consists of 13 subunits located at the inner membrane, encoded by the genes nuoA-N. Seven of the subunits are integral membrane proteins with the number of TMSs ranging from 3 to 14. The membrane-located protein NADH dehydrogenase II encoded by the gene ndh is 47 kDa, and YidC depletion under aerobic conditions has no effect on its activity (25.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate, both types can participate in respiration (28.Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and therefore NADH dehydrogenase activity assays cannot be used as a measure for the YidC depletion effect on these complexes. NADH dehydrogenase I is expressed under all anaerobic conditions but is important only during growth in the presence of fumarate (28.Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). NADH dehydrogenase I bears more similarity to human complex I than NADH dehydrogenase II. Because of its small size (10.8 kDa), subunit K (NuoK), a subunit with three TMSs, is a possible YidC substrate. Immunoblot analysis of IMVs was carried out using antibodies directed against NuoK (Fig. 4C). The data show that the levels of NuoK decrease upon YidC depletion. The data presented in this study demonstrate that under YidC-depleting conditions, E. coli is unable to grow anaerobically with either nitrate or fumarate as electron acceptors. The levels of various essential protein complexes were examined to determine possible reasons for the cessation of growth. Although some changes in the membrane protein profile were observed, the overall profile remained mostly unchanged under YidC-depleting conditions confirming the notion that most membrane proteins insert independently of YidC. It has been previously shown that neither the Sec translocase nor the Tat complex is influenced by YidC depletion in E. coli FTL10 (13.Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). One report suggested that SecE is weakly dependent on YidC (24.Yi L. Jiang F. Chen M. Cain B. Bolhuis A. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 10537-10544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the translocation of secretory proteins is only mildly affected by YidC depletion in aerobically grown cells (2.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Under our test conditions of anaerobic growth, the Sec translocase also remained intact, and the levels of LepB, a Sec translocon substrate, are unaffected by YidC depletion. Translocation was only marginally affected, which can mostly be attributed to a reduced capacity of YidC– membranes to generate a PMF. In anaerobically glucose-grown (fermenting) cells, the latter can be attributed to the decreased levels of F0cinthe membrane and thus of the functional F1F0-ATP synthase that is solely responsible for the generation of a PMF under those conditions (29.McCormick K.A. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24683-24691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because YidC is essential for the insertion of F0c and CyoA, YidC depletion under aerobic growth conditions results in a massive up-regulation of PspA (25.van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PspA is up-regulated in response to stress conditions that result in the dissipation of the PMF (30.Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Research in this area has been largely focused on aerobically grown E. coli cells, but one proteomic study has shown that under osmotic stress the PspA protein is not induced when cells are grown anaerobically (31.Weber A. Kogl S.A. Jung K. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7165-7175Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our data are in agreement with this study as the induction of PspA under the anaerobic growth conditions tested is greatly reduced when compared with aerobically grown cells. There are conflicting reports as to the mechanism by which the proteins contained in the psp operon enable the cell to cope with the dissipation of the PMF. One study in E. coli suggested that PspA and PspG switch the cell to anaerobic respiration and fermentation, thereby adjusting the energy usage and PMF generation of the cell (32.Jovanovic G. Lloyd L.J. Stumpf M.P. Mayhew A.J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21147-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, other microarray studies on Yersinia enterocolitica and E. coli showed only an up-regulation of the genes contained in the psp operon upon secretin overproduction and did not reveal a switch to anaerobic metabolism related to the induction of the Psp operon (33.Seo J. Savitzky D.C. Ford E. Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 714-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34.Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E. Jovanovic G. Gyaneshwar P. Rolfe M.D. Thompson A. Hinton J.C. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55707-55714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Psp proteins operate is therefore still largely unclear under aerobic as well as anaerobic growth conditions. Under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of nitrate, electron transfer from formate (from formate dehydrogenase) to nitrate is coupled to the generation of a PMF (9.Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 35.Garland P.B. Downie J.A. Haddock B.A. Biochem. J. 1975; 152: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). With fumarate reduction, the fumarate reductase is directly responsible for proton translocation (10.Cecchini G. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Maklashina E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 140-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A reduction of the levels of fumarate and nitrate reductases and of the F1F0-ATP synthase in the YidC depletion strain will result both in a loss of the PMF and of PMF-dependent ATP synthesis. Because these anaerobically grown cells can still generate ATP by the metabolism of glucose or glycerol at a substrate level (36.Lin E.C.C. Kuritzkes D.R. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 201-221Google Scholar, 37.Maloney P.C. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 222-243Google Scholar), the F1F0-ATP synthase is not essential for ATP synthesis under these anaerobically respiring conditions. Indeed, the unc– strain E. coli NN100 was able to grow with either nitrate or fumarate as an electron acceptor. It was shown that the protein levels and reducing activities of both the nitrate and the fumarate reductases were diminished upon YidC depletion. This could be responsible for the growth cessation observed. The α and β subunits of the nitrate reductase, NarG and NarH, respectively, are cytoplasmically located and attach to the integral membrane γ subunit NarI to form the nitrate reductase complex (9.Bertero M.G. Rothery R.A. Palak M. Hou C. Lim D. Blasco F. Weiner J.H. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 681-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Neither NarG, -H, or -I have any predicted Tat targeting sequences or signal peptide cleavage sites (TATFIND 1.4 (38.Rose R.W. Bruser T. Kissinger J.C. Pohlschroder M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) SignalP 3.0 (39.Emanuelsson O. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Nielsen H. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 953-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar)). NarG has, however, a vestige motif at its N terminus that appears to be a remnant of the Tat signature (40.Turner R.J. Papish A.L. Sargent F. Can. J. Microbiol. 2004; 50: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that NarJ, which is contained in the same operon as NarGHI, is a Tat-dependent chaperone that delivers the NarG and NarH complex to the membrane-inserted NarI (41.Chan C.S. Howell J.M. Workentine M.L. Turner R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the same study it was reported that the growth rate of cells in nitrate-containing media was impaired in the Δtat E. coli strain. This, however, conflicts with a previous study that reported that anaerobic growth with nitrate was not impaired in a ΔtatABCD E. coli strain (11.Sambasivarao D. Dawson H.A. Zhang G. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20167-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Neither studies determined whether mislocalization of the Tat-dependent formate dehydrogenase would have any effect on growth in nitrate-containing medium. The Tat pathway has been implicated in the membrane location of anaerobic respiratory complexes, which have an αβγ structure but where the αβ subunits are periplasmically located (11.Sambasivarao D. Dawson H.A. Zhang G. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20167-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 42.Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), for example, the NiFe hydrogenase-2 isoenzyme. The β subunit of this enzyme has one TMS, which is inserted by the Tat translocase itself and which is YidC–-independent (13.Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1377-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 43.Dubini A. Sargent F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The αβ subunits still attach and retain activity in the absence of the integral membrane γ subunit because of this C-terminally located TMS of the β subunit (43.Dubini A. Sargent F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 549: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the nitrate reductase neither NarG nor NarH has a TMS and therefore they may need NarI to functionally attach to the membrane. Fumarate reductase also has an αβγ structure with FrdA and FrdB forming a cytoplasmically located αβ subcomplex that attaches to the membrane via the integral membrane proteins FrdC and -D. The decrease in the levels of FrdA and FrdB associated with the inner membrane is suggestive of a role for YidC in the insertion of FrdC and FrdD because FrdA and FrdB cannot assemble at the bacterial membrane without first having the correct assembly of integral membrane parts FrdC and FrdD (44.Latour D.J. Weiner J.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 67: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). FrdC and FrD are both small (15 and 13 kDa, respectively) three TMS-containing proteins that have their N termini located in the cytoplasm and their C termini in the periplasm (45.Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Unlike some other anaerobic respiratory components, fumarate reductase has been shown to be independent of the Tat system for its membrane location and activity (11.Sambasivarao D. Dawson H.A. Zhang G. Shaw G. Hu J. Weiner J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20167-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that Oxa1l from human embryonic kidney cells does not appear to be responsible for the insertion and/or assembly of complex II, the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase whose structure is analogous to fumarate reductase (27.Stiburek L. Fornuskova D. Wenchich L. Pejznochova M. Hansikova H. Zeman J. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 374: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The levels of NuoK of the NADH dehydrogenase I were also examined following YidC depletion. These too were shown to decrease in the YidC– strain. If NuoK levels were decreased because of YidC dependence for its insertion, it would have a detrimental NADH dehydrogenase activity as most of the active peripheral arm of the complex is also absent if the NuoK subunit is (46.Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This could contribute to or be responsible for the cessation of growth under YidC-depleting conditions in the presence of fumarate. Interestingly, a recent cross-linking study indicates an association between YidC and NuoCD (47.van Bloois E. Dekker H.L. Froderberg L. Houben E.N. Urbanus M.L. de Koster C.G. de Gier J.W. Luirink J. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), lending further support to the notion that NADH dehydrogenase I assembly may be YidC-dependent. Although it has been shown in this study and by others that neither the Sec translocase nor the Tat complex is influenced by YidC depletion in E. coli FTL10, we cannot exclude other effects of YidC depletion that may affect the membrane targeting and insertion of the systems analyzed in this study. The other identified YidC only substrate, MscL, is essential only under osmotic stress conditions. Obviously, a defect in the membrane assembly and folding of other membrane proteins, as for instance the transport systems involved in the uptake of nitrate and fumarate, may further contribute to the growth defect in cells depleted from YidC (48.Nagamori S. Smirnova I.N. Kaback H.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Future studies will focus on the insertion and assembly of the integral membrane components of the nitrate and fumarate reductase complexes as well as those of the NADH dehydrogenase I.

https://openalex.org/W2077860947,"Aberrant phosphorylation of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins is a key pathological event in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Previous studies have shown that Pin1, a peptidylprolyl cis/trans-isomerase, may be actively involved in the regulation of Tau hyperphosphorylation in AD. Here, we show that Pin1 modulates oxidative stress-induced NF-H phosphorylation. In an in vitro kinase assay, the addition of Pin1 substantially increased phosphorylation of NF-H KSP repeats by proline-directed kinases, Erk1/2, Cdk5/p35, and JNK3 in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo, dominant-negative (DN) Pin1 and Pin1 small interfering RNA inhibited epidermal growth factor-induced NF-H phosphorylation. Because oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, we studied the role of Pin1 in stressed cortical neurons and HEK293 cells. Both hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and heat stresses induce phosphorylation of NF-H in transfected HEK293 cells and primary cortical cultures. Knockdown of Pin1 by transfected Pin1 short interference RNA and DN-Pin1 rescues the effect of stress-induced NF-H phosphorylation. The H2O2 and heat shock induced perikaryal phospho-NF-H accumulations, and neuronal apoptosis was rescued by inhibition of Pin1 in cortical neurons. JNK3, a brain-specific JNK isoform, is activated under oxidative and heat stresses, and inhibition of Pin1 by Pin1 short interference RNA and DN-Pin1 inhibits this pathway. These results implicate Pin1 as a possible modulator of stress-induced NF-H phosphorylation as seen in neurodegenerative disorders like AD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, Pin1 may be a potential therapeutic target for these diseases.

The reversible phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro ((S/T)P) motifs governed by Pro-directed protein kinases and phosphatases is a major regulatory mechanism for the control of various cellular processes. The phosphorylation state of a protein reflects the balance between the activation of kinases and phosphatases, and also of partners, such as isomerases, able to support their activity through conformational changes.

The deregulation of NF-H tail domain phosphorylation is correlated with some pathology seen in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in which aberrant tail domain phosphorylation occurs in neuronal perikarya (6Manetto V.

Rat NF-H has 52 KSP repeats in the tail domain, and almost all of them are phosphorylated in vivo (8Jaffe H. Veeranna Pant H.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16211-16224Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 9Veeranna Amin N.D. Ahn N.G. Jaffe H. Winters C.A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 64: 4008-4021Crossref Google Scholar). The multiple repeats of the SP moiety suggest that reconfiguration of NF-H may involve additional factors to catalyze peptidylprolyl isomerization. One such candidate for this is the peptidylprolyl isomerase, Pin1 (protein interacting with NIMA (never in mitosis A)-1). Pin1 catalyzes the cis to trans isomerization of peptide bonds that link Ser(P) or Thr(P) residues to proline. Although Pin1 has been widely studied in relation to the cell cycle and cancer, little is known about its role in the brain. Recent data suggested that Pin1 might be involved in AD pathogenesis, because it is found in neurofibrillary tangles (10Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Pin1 has also been shown to facilitate Tau dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (10Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that Pin1 may also be implicated in post-phosphorylation modulation of pSer/pThr-Pro (KSP) repeats in NF-H, which, when deregulated, may lead to perikaryal motor-neuron inclusions typical of ALS (11Kesavapany S. Patel V. Zheng Y.L. Pareek T.K. Bjelogrlic M. Albers W. Amin N. Jaffe H. Gutkind J.S. Strong M.J. Grant P. Pant H.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 9: 3645-3655Crossref Google Scholar). A growing number of phosphorylated proteins participating in important cellular processes such as RNA polymerase II (12Xu Y.-X. Hirose Y. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and CDC25 (13Crenshaw D.G. Yang J. Means A.R. Kornbluth S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) are regulated through prolyl isomerase-induced conformational changes. Pin1 activity has been reported to influence its target proteins in two completely opposite fashions: 1) It can facilitate the dephosphorylation of Tau by protein phosphatase 2A (10Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). 2) Pin1 is shown to facilitate hyperphosphorylation and inhibit dephosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (12Xu Y.-X. Hirose Y. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Several processes are up-regulated by Pin1: some of these involve its actions on Cyclin D1 (14Liou Y.C. Ryo A. Huang H.K. Lu P.J. Bronson R. Fujimori F. Uchida T. Hunter T. Lu K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Means A.R. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 37-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) involve processes that are down-regulated by Pin1. Oxidative stress, an early event in AD that occurs prior to cytopathology, can induce rapid hyperphosphorylation of KSP epitopes of NF-H in cultured neurons. This is likely to be mediated by activation of proline-directed kinases or by protein phosphatase 2A inactivation (22Jaffe H. Veeranna Shetty K.T. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar). The role of stress-activated protein kinases such as JNK (SAPK) were reported to be involved in stress-induced NF-H phosphorylation (23Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30404-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24Brownlees J. Yates A. Bajaj N.P. Davis D. Anderton B.H. Leigh P.N. Shaw C.E. Miller C.C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the JNK isoforms, JNK3 (SAPK1β) is the major stress activated protein kinase widely expressed in the nervous system (25Martin J.H. Mohit A. Miller C.A. Mol. Brain. Res. 1996; 35: 47-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), specifically in neuronal cell bodies (26Merritt S.E. Matas M. Nihalani D. Zhu X. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10195-10202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). JNK3 is shown to phosphorylate neurofilament (NF-H) and is activated under glutamate stress (24Brownlees J. Yates A. Bajaj N.P. Davis D. Anderton B.H. Leigh P.N. Shaw C.E. Miller C.C.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 401-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Absence of excitotoxicity-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus of JNK3 knockout mice has been reported (27Davis R.J. Rakic J.P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that Pin1 elevates the NF-H phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases such as Erk1/2, Cdk5, and JNK3 in vitro. Both dominant-negative (DN) Pin1 and Pin1 siRNA reduced oxidative and heat stress-induced aberrant NF-H hyperphosphorylation. We show that Pin1 modulates the H2O2 and heat stress-induced perikaryal phosphorylation of NF-H via the activation of JNK3. Homology Modeling—Modeling of the structure of rat Pin1 was performed based on the x-ray structures of the proteins that produced the best E value when using BLAST against the protein in the protein data bank (PDB) data base using the Swiss PDB Viewer package (www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html) (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). The molecular modeling method used was ProMod II (28Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional models of rat Pin1 were predicted using the coordinates of human Pin1 (PDB code 1nmv, determined at 1.45 Å) (29Bayer E. Goettsch S. Mueller J.W. Griewel B. Guiberman E. Mayr L.M. Bayer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26183-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Pin1 protein sequence was aligned with the sequence of the homologous Pin1 using the advanced BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Refinement of side chains and terminal chains was done using the Molecular Operation Environment software package (Version 2001.01, Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). The generated model was then energy minimized in SYBYL (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO) using a three-stage protocol involving simplex, conjugate-gradient, and Powell minimization methods, by moving side chains alone, to relieve short contacts at the interprotomer interfaces. The quality of the three-dimensional model was evaluated using PROCHECK and Prosa II version 3.0 (30Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). Improvements in the model were obtained by an iterative sequence-structure alignment procedure, yielding the final sequence alignment between the Pin1 domain and homologous structures. The modeled structure was stable at room temperature during a 140-ps unconstrained full protein molecular dynamics simulation. Three-dimensional models were visualized by RasMol (31Sayle R. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar), and calculations were performed on Silicon Graphics IRIS 4D/25 workstations. Primary Embryonic Neuronal Culture—Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared from E17-18-day-old Wistar rat embryos as follows. The brain and meninges were the first to be removed. Cortex was carefully dissected out and mechanically dissociated in culture medium by triturating with a polished Pasteur pipette. Once dissociated and after trypan blue counting, cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 in poly-d-lysine-coated 6-well plates (BD Biosciences). For dissociation, plating, and maintenance, we used Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 containing 200 μm glutamine and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic agent (Invitrogen). The medium was replenished every 3 days and 24 h before cell treatment. Pin1 and NF-H cDNAs—Dominant-negative Pin1 was produced by making a point mutation to produce an alanine at serine 16, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections of wild-type and dominant-negative Pin1 constructs were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type Pin1 was cloned into pGEX-5X-1 obtained from Amersham Bio-sciences for GST expression studies. Pin1 siRNA—Employing the HiPerformance Design Algorithm, synthetic 21-mer siRNA (short interfering RNA) was designed and synthesized (Qiagen). Pin1 siRNA (silencing) sense and antisense sequences were: 5′-r(GCUCAGGCCGAGUGUACUA)dTdT-3′ and 5′-r(UAGUACACUCGGCCUGAGC)dTdT-3′, respectively. All Stars negative control siRNA, a scrambled, non-silencing control siRNA, was obtained (Qiagen). Sense and antisense sequence for non silencing siRNA were: 5′-r(UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-r(ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAA)d(TT)-3′, respectively. To ensure the absence of possible complementary binding sites in mammalian genomes, the siRNA sequences were extensively checked against the GenBank™ data base using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This strategy was used to exclude significant sequence homology within the genomes of mammalian species, which may interfere with the target specificity of the siRNA and contribute to unwanted off-target effects in later experiments. The sense and antisense strands were annealed to create the double-stranded siRNA at a 20 μm concentration. Control siRNA and Pin1 siRNA were dissolved in suspension buffer to obtain a 20 μm solution and then heated at 90 °C for 1 min. The final transfection step was preceded by a 60-min incubation at 37 °C. Delivery of siRNA was performed as described previously (11Kesavapany S. Patel V. Zheng Y.L. Pareek T.K. Bjelogrlic M. Albers W. Amin N. Jaffe H. Gutkind J.S. Strong M.J. Grant P. Pant H.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 9: 3645-3655Crossref Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency of siRNA in HEK293 cells and cortical neurons was judged to be greater than 80% using fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides. For experiments using cell lines, cells were transfected with siRNA or the indicated constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I for 24 h, and then the medium was changed back to growth medium for additional incubation. For experiments using primary cultures, 5 DIC cortical neurons were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 in Opti-MEM I for 1.5 h. Subsequently, the medium was changed back to neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), and neurons were cultured for additional periods of time before further treatment. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum, and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human NF-H tail domain expression construct, wild-type Pin1, and dominant-negative Pin1 constructs were either transfected independently or co-transfected. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were starved in the presence of 0.2% calf serum overnight (to reduce any back-ground stimulation by serum factors), and then the cells were induced with EGF (10 nm) or PD98059. Finally, the cells were fixed for immunocytochemistry analysis or lysed with lysis buffer for Western blot analysis. Cell Treatment—Cortical neurons 7 days in culture (7 DIC) or HEK293 cells transfected with NF-H for 2 days were treated with 1 mm H2O2 for 1 h, or exposed to 44 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. Thirty percent stock H2O2 (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.2 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). JNK inhibitor (SP600125) was purchased from Calbiochem and used at 100 μm in HEK293 cells and cortical neurons. Antibodies—Pin1 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA) and Oncogene Research Products and used for Western blotting (1:1,000) and immunohistochemistry (1:100), respectively. RT-97 antibody that specifically stains p-NF-H was provided by Drs. Ralph Nixon and Veeranna (Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY) and used at 1:500-1000 dilutions for immunofluorescence and 1:5000 dilutions for Western blotting. SMI31 was obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ) and used at 1:500 for immunofluorescence and 1:2500 for Western blotting. Anti-tubulin antibody (clone DM1A), total NF-H (clone N52), and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were used at 1:10,000 for Western blotting and 1:1,000 for nuclear counter-staining, respectively. Anti-phospho-Jun, c-Jun, JNK, and actin antisera were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Equal volumes of cells harvested in Nu-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) were denaturated at 100 °C during 5 min, loaded onto 4-12% Nu-PAGE Novex gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8, 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% skim milk or bovine serum albumin, and incubated with primary antibody. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs, Sigma), and bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of the Fusion Proteins—The pGEX recombinant plasmid containing Pin1 was expressed and purified as described earlier (32Pant A.C. Veeranna Pant H.C. Amin N. Brain Res. 1997; 2: 259-266Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rat NF-H was purified as described (22Jaffe H. Veeranna Shetty K.T. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2681-2690PubMed Google Scholar). Assay Conditions of Phosphorylation—Bacterially expressed and purified NF-H (2.5 μg) was incubated in an in vitro kinase assay reaction buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm each of vanadate, EGTA, EDTA, and dithiothreitol) 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Reaction was performed at 30 °C for 2 h with 1 unit of p42/44 MAPK or Cdk5 or JNK. In vitro JNK assay was performed using (GST)-cJun-(1-79) (Stratagene) as a substrate. Endogenous JNK from 7 DIC cortical neurons was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal JNK3-selective antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). c-Jun fusion protein at a concentration of 2 μg/20 μl reaction was phosphorylated using JNK3 in an in vitro kinase assay with 1× Kinase Buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP) and 1 mm ATP. After a 30-min assay at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation was detected by Western blot with phospho-specific c-Jun antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocytochemical Staining of Neuronal Cultures—Primary rat cortical neurons were plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips and processed for immunocytochemistry as previously described (34Kesavapany S. Amin N. Zheng Y.L. Nijhara R. Jaffe H. Sihag R. Gutkind J.S. Takahashi S. Kulkarni A. Grant P. Pant H.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4421-4431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Coverslips were mounted using Gel-Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Double immunostainings were carried out using anti-Pin1 and RT-97 antibodies. Pin1 staining was revealed with a goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor®488 and RT-97 with a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor®568 (Molecular Probes). In situ cytotoxicity kits were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN) and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling) staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions before immunocytochemistry was carried out. Images were captured with an oil immersion 63× objective on a Zeiss LSM510 using LSM Image Software. Statistics—Each experiment was repeated at least four times. The data were expressed as the means ± S.D. Student's t tests were used to compare the effects of all treatments. The differences were considered statistically significant as: *, p < 0.01; and **, p < 0.001. The presence of multiple SP repeats in NF-H protein suggests that Pin1 could play a direct role in NF-H function by influencing its phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 1A). Comparative modeling based on human Pin1 model (29Bayer E. Goettsch S. Mueller J.W. Griewel B. Guiberman E. Mayr L.M. Bayer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26183-26193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) revealed a conserved molecular model for mouse and rat Pin1 (Fig. 1B) with a WW domain on the N terminus and an isomerase catalytic domain on the C terminus (Fig. 1C). We expressed and purified human Pin1 (as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli) and rat NF-H (recombinant protein in E. coli) (Fig. 1, D and E). Pin1 Stimulates NF-H Phosphorylation by p42/44 MAPK and Cdk5/p35—Initially, we sought to test the effect of Pin1 on the ability of proline-directed kinases to phosphorylate NF-H. Several proline-directed kinases have been identified, and they function under different physiological conditions. Both, MAPKs (Erk1/2 and JNKs) and CdK5 play pivotal roles in NF phosphorylation and in the development of the nervous system by mediating both neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. To examine the potential role of Pin1 in NF-H phosphorylation by MAPKs and CdK5, we first used purified NF-H as a substrate. Recombinant and purified NF-H was incubated with p42/44 MAPK in a kinase assay buffer containing ATP either without or with increasing concentrations of GST-Pin1. The phosphorylated NF-H was run on SDS-PAGE and detected by RT-97 antibody, a monoclonal antibody that detects the p-NF-H. Strikingly, addition of GST-Pin1 increased phosphorylation of NF-H in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Addition of GST alone to the reaction mixture did not alter the p-NF-H levels (data not shown). We next tested whether Pin1 might also stimulate phosphorylation of NF-H by Cdk5/p35. Bacterially expressed and purified NF-H was incubated with or without GST-Pin1 and CdK5/p35. NF-H phosphorylation was monitored by Western blotting with RT-97 antibody. GST-Pin1 significantly stimulated phosphorylation of NF-H by CdK5/p35 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, GST-Pin1 elevated the phosphorylation of NF-H in a dose-dependent manner by JNK3 (Fig. 1, E and F). These results suggest that Pin1 facilitates the phosphorylation of NF-H by proline-directed kinases such as Erk1/2, Cdk5, and JNK3. Pin1 Modulates the NF-H Phosphorylation in HEK293 Cells—Because Pin1 has the potential to modulate the NF-H phosphorylation levels in vitro, it was important to determine if Pin1 directly modulates the NF-H phosphorylation levels in situ. HEK293 cells do not express endogenous NF. We initially examined the phosphorylation status of NF-H in NF-H-transfected HEK293 cells by Western blotting. EGF stimulation of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with NF-H increased the p-NF-H, suggesting that MAPKs phosphorylate NF-H in vivo. The EGF-mediated increase in p-NF-H is inhibited by the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059 (Fig. 3, A and B). If the function of the Pin1 is to increase the phosphorylation of NF-H, the cotransfection of NF-H and DN-Pin1 should reduce the p-NF-H levels. A DN-Pin1 construct, made by mutating Ser-16 to Ala, inhibits the isomerase activity of Pin1. Transfected DN-Pin1 migrated as a green fluorescence protein fusion protein at ∼50 kDa, whereas endogenous Pin1 migrated at ∼18 kDa. Expression of NF-H with transfected DN-Pin1 reduced NF-H phosphorylation in EGF-treated transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Furthermore, in EGF-treated transfected cells, endogenous Pin1 colocalizes with p-NF-H (Fig. 3C). In addition, inhibition of Pin1 by Pin1 siRNA but not scrambled siRNA reduced the p-NF-H expression (Fig. 3, D and E). These results demonstrate that Pin1 modulates NF-H phosphorylation. Pin1 Modulates the Oxidative Stress-induced Phosphorylation of NF-H in Transfected HEK293 Cells—We next investigated possible functional consequences of Pin1-dependent hyperphosphorylation of NF-H. Experimental motor neuron disease models are characterized by oxidative stress leading to the accumulation of phospho-NFs within perikarya. Oxidative stress happens to be an early event in AD prior to cytopathology"
https://openalex.org/W2008440048,"Ethanol induces the development of hepatic steatosis, increasingly recognized as causing vulnerability to subsequent liver injury. Ethanol has been shown to activate SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) processing through the conventional cholesterol-sensitive pathway (1You M. Fischer M. Deeg M.A. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29342-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that ethanol can also bring about SREBP-1 cleavage and activation through a novel pathway dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum-localized caspases-4 and -12. Evidence is presented that tumor necrosis factor can stimulate caspase-4 and -12 activation in ethanol-exposed cells, which cleaves SREBP-1 to a transcriptionally active form to induce the synthesis of lipogenic enzymes and triglycerides. Moreover, the caspase-4 and -12-dependent activation of SREBP-1 is insensitive to the normal negative feedback exerted by cholesterol and is mediated by the translocation of the scaffolding protein, TRAF-2, to the endoplasmic reticulum.

Evidence is presented that tumor necrosis factor can stimulate caspase-4 and -12 activation in ethanol-exposed cells, which cleaves SREBP-1 to a transcriptionally active form to induce the synthesis of lipogenic enzymes and triglycerides. Moreover, the caspase-4 and -12-dependent activation of SREBP-1 is insensitive to the normal negative feedback exerted by cholesterol and is mediated by the translocation of the scaffolding protein, TRAF-2, to the endoplasmic reticulum. Hepatic steatosis is a frequent complication of excessive ethanol consumption. The etiology is due to the dual effects of decreasing fatty acid β-oxidation and increasing fatty acid synthesis (2Lieber C.S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1997; 257: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 3Crabb D.W. Liangpunsakul S. J. Gastroenterol.

Steatosis was once thought to be a benign condition, but recent reevaluation has uncovered that hepatic steatosis can predispose the liver to more progressive and serious forms of liver injury such as alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. The etiology of the steatosis caused by ethanol was thought to typically involve an increase in the concentration of NADH caused by the metabolism of ethanol. Although this may be an important contributory factor, additional effects of ethanol abet in the surplus lipid accumulation. For instance, ethanol exposure activates sterol response element-binding proteins (SREBP) 2The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol response element-binding proteinsACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseSREsterol response elementERendoplasmic reticulumSCAPSREBP cleavage activating proteinTNFtumor necrosis factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNACHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseIRE-1inositol-requiring protein 1TRAF-2tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 2. 2The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol response element-binding proteinsACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseSREsterol response elementERendoplasmic reticulumSCAPSREBP cleavage activating proteinTNFtumor necrosis factorsiRNAsmall interfering RNACHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidJNKc-Jun NH2-terminal kinaseIRE-1inositol-requiring protein 1TRAF-2tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 2. that elevate the levels and activities of lipogenic enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (3Crabb D.W.

Three isoforms of SREBP exist, SREBP-1a, -1c, and 2. SREBP-1a and 1c are transcribed from a common gene but utilize differing transcription start sites that result in alternate forms of exon 1 (5Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2002; 67: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6Rawson R.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a regulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, whereas SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 are involved mainly in regulating fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, respectively. The SREBPs reside in the endoplasmic reticulum. SREBP is organized into an amino-terminal domain that contains the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper motif for binding to sterol response elements (SRE) in the promoter regions of SREBP responsive genes. For SREBP to perform its function as a transcription factor, the amino-terminal domain must be released from the intermembrane portion of the protein and translocate to the nucleus. This is accomplished by the proteolytic cleavage of the amino-terminal domain from the carboxylterminal domain by the sequential action of two proteases: site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) located in the Golgi apparatus. SREBP must first be escorted from its site in the ER to the Golgi by SREBP cleavage activating protein (SCAP). SCAP possesses a cholesterol sensing domain. When cholesterol levels are low, SCAP escorts SREBP from the ER to the Golgi where S1P initially cleaves the precursor form of SREBP in the luminal loop, producing a membrane-bound intermediate. S2P then cleaves the intermediate to release the transcription factor domain from the membrane. When the cholesterol level of the cell rises, SCAP undergoes a conformational change that causes it to bind to the ER resident proteins, Insig-1 or -2, which hinders the incorporation of the SCAP-SREBP complex into ER transport vesicles. In this instance, SREBP cannot be transported to the Golgi to undergo activation by S1P and S2P. In this way the activation of SREBP is suppressed when cholesterol levels are elevated. Recent studies have uncovered that ethanol exposure can provoke the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (7Kaplowitz N. Ji C. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2006; 21: S7-S9Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A number of adverse conditions are known to induce ER stress and provoke the unfolded protein response (8Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar, 9Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Ethanol brings about a myriad of alterations in cell function, any of which separately or in tandem may help promote ER stress. For instance, an increase in the levels of homocysteine brought about by ethanol has been shown to induce ER stress (10Ji C. Kaplowitz N. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1488-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 11Ji C. Kaplowitz N. World J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 10: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The homocysteine-induced response is associated with activation of SREBPs. The ER stress response entails the mobilization and synthesis of a number of proteins such as CHOP and activation of caspases-4 and -12 (10Ji C. Kaplowitz N. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 1488-1499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 12Kalai M. Lamkanfi M. Denecker G. Boogmans M. Lippens S. Meeus A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Indeed, ethanol exposure has been shown to bring about the ER-localized activation of caspase-12 in the liver of micropigs (13Esfandiari F. Villanueva J.A. Wong D.H. French S.W. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: G54-G63Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates that sublethal concentrations of TNF can bring about the activation of caspases-4 and -12 in ethanol-exposed cells that in turn is capable of cleaving and activating SREBP-1. Moreover, the caspase-4 and -12-dependent cleavage and activation of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells is insensitive to the normal negative feedback of cholesterol, thus resulting in disengagement in the activation of SREBP-1 from the intracellular levels of cholesterol and causing an inappropriate induction of lipogenic enzymes in the face of cholesterol excess. Cell Culture and Treatments—HepG2 cells and McA-RH 7777 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were subcultured 1:5 once a week. The cells were treated with 25 mm ethanol for 48 h. Where indicated, cells were first exposed to 25 mm ethanol for 24 h and then treated with TNF at a concentration of 1 ng/ml for an additional 24 h in the presence of 25 mm ethanol. Where indicated in the figure legends, cultures were supplemented with a combination of cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol at concentrations of 10 and 1 μg/ml, respectively. The culture medium was replaced every 24 h with fresh medium containing ethanol. To prevent evaporation of ethanol, the flasks or plates were placed in a plastic dessicator in the incubator containing a mixture of water and ethanol. The level of ethanol in the culture medium was monitored spectrophotometrically by an alcohol dehydrogenase assay. The level of NADH was measured by an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. After 24 h of ethanol exposure, the cells (control or ethanol-treated) were trypsinized, counted in a hemocytometer, and plated into 6-well 9.3-cm2 plates at 1.0 × 106 cells for determination of caspase-4 and -12 activities. The cells were allowed to attach and spread for 24 h. When present, ethanol was added back to the cells during this time. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 25 mm ethanol. Where indicated, TNF was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and added to the wells in a 0.2% volume to give a final concentration of 1 ng/ml (22 units/ml) and incubated for an additional 24 h (total ethanol exposure of 48 h). Detection of Caspase-4 and -12 Activity and Triglyceride Assay—The caspase-4 and -12 assays are based on the ability of the active enzyme to cleave the fluorophore AFC from enzyme substrates LEVD-AFC and ATAD-AFC, respectively. Cell extracts were prepared and diluted 1:1 with 2× reaction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Caspase-4 or -12 substrate was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then transferred to a 96-well plate, and fluorescence measurements were made in a 96-well plate reader at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission. For measurement of triglyceride levels, cells where harvested and the level of triglycerides determined enzymatically with absorbance of the reaction measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm (Sigma). RNA Interference—The Dharmacon SMART selection and SMART pooling technologies are utilized for RNA interference studies. The SMART selection uses an algorithm composed of 33 criteria and parameters that attempt to limit nonfunctional small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). SMART pooling combines four SMART-selected siRNA duplexes in a single pool to increase the probability of reducing mRNA levels by at least 75%. The siRNAs targeting SREBP-1, caspases-4, -12, or -3, and tumor necrosis factor-associated factor 2 (TRAF-2) were delivered by a lipid-based method supplied from a commercial vendor (Gene Therapy Systems) at a final siRNA concentration of 100 nm. After formation of the siRNA-liposome complexes, the mixture was added to the McA-RH 7777 or HepG2 cells in serum-free medium for 4 h. Afterward, the medium was aspirated, and complete medium was added back with or without the addition of 25 mm ethanol for 48 h. Isolation of Cytosolic and Microsomal Fractions and Western Blotting—Cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks at 5.0 × 106 cells/flask. After treatments, the cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 3 volumes of isolation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium/EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin in 250 mm sucrose). After being chilled on ice for 3 min, the cells were disrupted by 40 strokes of a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 2,500 × g at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. The mitochondria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was re-centrifuged at 200,000 × g (Beckman Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge) for 1 h for the preparation of microsomes. The resulting supernatant contains the soluble cytosolic fraction and the microsomal pellet represents the ER and Golgi. Various fractions, as indicated in the figure legends (25 μg of protein) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Full-length and cleaved SREBP-1 were detected with a polyclonal antibody to SREBP-1 at a dilution of 1:500 (Affinity Bioreagents). TRAF-2 was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technologies). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was detected with a rabbit monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technologies). Caspase-4 was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 (4B9; MBL International). Caspases-3 and -9 were detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize the activated cleavage products at a dilution of 1:500 (Calbiochem). In each case, the relevant protein was visualized by staining with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (1:10,000) and was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. SRE Binding and Reporter Assay—After 24 h of ethanol exposure in the presence or absence of cholesterol supplementation, cells were transiently transfected with a native luciferase reporter construct or a luciferase reporter driven by an SRE promoter containing multiple SRE elements upstream of a minimal TA promoter derived from the TATA box of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter (Panomics). The transfected cells were incubated for a further 24 h in 25 mm ethanol in the absence or presence of cholesterol supplementation and/or TNF treatment. The cells were then lysed (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) and luciferase activity measured with a luciferase activity assay kit (Stratagene) utilizing a single tube luminometer (Berthold). Luciferase activity measured in cells lysates was normalized to β-galactosidase expression and is expressed relative to values obtained using the empty luciferase reporter vector. For the SRE binding assay, nuclei were isolated from McA-RH 7777 or HepG2 cells exposed to the conditions indicated. Cleaved and active SREBP-1 binds specifically to a double-stranded DNA sequence containing the SREBP response element immobilized to the wells of a 96-well plate. The SREBP-1 was detected by the addition of a SREBP-1 antibody. Following washes, a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added and a colorimetric signal was detected at 450 nm on a plate reader. Generation of Recombinant SREBP-1 and in Vitro Cleavage Assay—Knock-down and rescue experiments were performed on HepG2 and McA-RH 7777 cells. First, endogenous SREBP-1 expression was repressed by siRNA transfection targeting SREBP-1 as described above. SREBP-1 expression was then restored by transfection with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid containing a cDNA for the expression of the caspase site mutants SREBP-1(D460A) for the human HepG2 cells and SREBP-1(D451A) for the mouse McA-RH 7777 cells, respectively. Note that the human and mouse proteins differ slightly in their location of the caspase cleavage site and the S2P protease cleavage site. Arginines 527 and 524 for the human and mouse proteins, respectively, are crucial for S2P cleavage. Therefore mutants SREBP-1(R527A) and SREBP-1(R524A) were generated and expressed in HepG2 cells and McA-RH 7777 cells, respectively. Purified SREBP-1 containing a histidine tag was generated by in vitro transcription and translation followed by purification on a nickel resin. The purified SREBP-1 was incubated with 5 units of recombinant caspase-3, -4, or -2 (EMD Biosciences) in caspase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm dithiothreitol). TNFα Provokes a Cholesterol-independent Activation of SREBP-1 in Ethanol-exposed Cells—Exposure of the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH 7777 to ethanol has been shown to activate SREBP-1 (1You M. Fischer M. Deeg M.A. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29342-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1A, top panel, exposure of McA-RH 7777 cells to 25 mm ethanol for 48 h results in the appearance of the cleaved form of SREBP-1 (second lane). The antibody used detects both SREBP-1a and -1c isoforms. Similarly, exposure of the human cell line HepG2 to 25 mm ethanol also resulted in cleavage of SREBP-1 (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, second lane). As expected and demonstrated previously, the cleavage of SREBP-1 elicited by ethanol exposure was prevented by the addition of exogenous cholesterol in both instances (Fig. 1A, third lane). We have previously shown that ethanol exposure sensitizes hepatocytes to TNF-induced cytotoxicity at a dose of 10 ng/ml. Importantly, in the present study, a 10-fold lower concentration of TNF (1 ng/ml) is utilized that did not bring about any significant cell death in the presence or absence of ethanol. The addition of TNF at a concentration of 1 ng/ml had no effect on SREBP-1 cleavage in control cells (Fig. 1A, fourth lane). However, in ethanol-exposed cells, TNF rendered the cleavage of SREBP-1 insensitive to inhibition by cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 1A, fifth lane, the addition of 1 ng/ml TNF to ethanol-exposed cells resulted in the appearance of two cleavage fragments of SREBP-1. Moreover, in contrast to the ability of cholesterol supplementation to suppress SREBP-1 cleavage in ethanol-exposed cells, it is demonstrated in Fig. 1, sixth lane, that the addition of sublethal doses of TNF made cleavage of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells insensitive to inhibition by cholesterol. Importantly, in this instance cholesterol supplementation suppressed the appearance of the 68-kDa fragment while having no effect on the 65-kDa fragment. It thus appears that the cholesterol-insensitive cleavage of SREBP-1 results in a product that migrates at 65 kDa compared with 68 kDa for the cholesterol-sensitive pathway, indicating differing sites of cleavage. TNFα Activates Caspase-4 or -12 in Ethanol-exposed Cells That Mediates the Cholesterol Insensitive Cleavage of SREBP-1—Caspases-4 and -12 are resident in the ER of human and mouse cells, respectively, and are activated by agents that incite the ER stress response such as ethanol (14Pelletier N. Casamayor-Palleja M. De Luca K. Mondiere P. Saltel F. Jurdic P. Bella C. Genestier L. Defrance T. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1340-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Kamada S. Washida M.

Immunol. 2007; 179: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, exposure of McA-RH 7777 or HepG2 cells to 25 mm ethanol for 48 h did cause a slight increase in the activity of caspases-4 or -12. Similarly, treatment of control cells with 1 ng/ml TNF caused a minor increase in caspase-4 or -12 activity. However, when ethanol-exposed cells were treated with TNFα (1 ng/ml), there was a robust increase in caspase-4 and -12 activities, reaching 3.5-4-fold above control levels. Moreover, the TNF-induced activation of caspases-4 and -12 was not prevented by the addition of cholesterol, but was inhibited by the presence of the selective caspase-4 or -12 inhibitors, LEVD-FMK and ATAD-FMK, respectively. Caspase-3 has been shown to cleave and activate SREBP-1, however, it is unknown if caspases-4 or -12 share this property (17Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1939-1946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we wanted to determine whether the ER-localized caspase-4 and -12 could be responsible for the cholesterol-insensitive cleavage of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF. As shown in Fig.1C, first lane, addition of the caspase-4 or -12 inhibitors did not prevent cleavage of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells, indicating this is mediated by the conventional SCAP-mediated pathway. As shown in Fig. 1C, second lane, cholesterol was unable to prevent cleavage of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells in the presence of TNF (Fig. 1B, second lane). However, preincubation with caspase-4 or -12 inhibitors prevented the cholesterol-insensitive cleavage of SREBP-1 induced by TNF in ethanol-exposed cells (Fig. 1B, third lane). The activation of ER-localized caspases was selective in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF (1 ng/ml). As shown in Fig. 2A (third and fourth lanes), caspase-4 was cleaved to an active form in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF in the absence or presence of cholesterol. By contrast caspases-9 and -3 were not cleaved in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF. However, treatment with staurosporine caused the cleavage of caspases-4, -9, and -3 (Fig. 2A, fifth lane). Importantly, staurosporine resulted in significant cell killing, whereas TNF at 1 ng/ml did not cause a loss of cell viability in the ethanol-exposed cells. Next, the ability of caspase-4 to directly cleave SREBP-1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 2B, recombinant caspase-4 was able to cleave SREBP-1 in cell extracts as was caspase-3. By contrast, caspase-2 did not result in significant SREBP-1 cleavage. SREBP-1 possesses a consensus caspase cleavage site at aspartate 460 in the human protein or aspartate 474 in the mouse, a site very close to arginine 527 or 524 cleavage sites utilized by S2P in the human and mouse SREBP-1, respectively. Knock-down and rescue experiments were then performed wherein native SREBP-1 expression was first suppressed with siRNA followed by transfection with a plasmid construct that induced the expression of SREBP-1 where the caspase cleavage site at aspartate 460 or 474 in the human and mouse SREBP-1, respectively, were mutated to an alanine residue (SREBP(D460A) or -(D474A)). As shown in Fig. 2C, top panels, second lanes, ethanol exposure was able to induce the cleavage of SREBP-1 caspase site mutants. This is consistent with the asparagine 527 or 524 cleavage sites utilized by S2P in the human or mouse proteins, respectively, remaining intact in SBERP(D460A) or SREBP(D474A). In addition, the SREBP(D460A) and SREBP(D474A) cleavage induced by ethanol was prevented by supplementation with cholesterol (Fig. 2C, top panels, third lane). However, in contrast to native SREBP-1, TNF was unable to initiate cleavage of the caspase consensus site mutants, SREBP(D460A) or SREBP(D474A), in ethanol-exposed cells in the presence of cholesterol supplementation (Fig. 2C, top panels, fourth lane). By distinction, rescue of SREBP-1 expression with mutants where the S2P site of cleavage at arginine 527 or 524 in the human or mouse proteins, respectively, is mutated to alanine (SREBP(R527A) or -(R524A)) confirms that caspases-4 and -12 utilize different sites from S2P. As shown in Fig. 2C, bottom panels, second lane, ethanol exposure alone was unable to initiate cleavage of the S2P site mutants, SREBP(R527A) or SREBP(R524A). However, the S2P site mutants, SREBP(R527A) and SREBP(R524A), remained sensitive to cleavage induced by TNF in ethanol-exposed cells in the presence of cholesterol supplementation. As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, bottom panels, fourth lane, SREBP(R527A) or SREBP(R524A) were cleaved in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF in the presence of cholesterol supplementation. Together these data indicate that the cleavage sites of SREBP-1 utilized in ethanol-exposed cells are distinct depending on the absence or presence of TNF and cholesterol supplementation. Suppression of caspase-4 and -12 expression was carried out utilizing siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3A, non-targeting siRNA had no effect on the expression of caspases-4 or -12 in HepG2 and McA-RH 7777 cells, respectively. By contrast siRNA targeting caspase-4 in HepG2 cells down-regulated the expression of caspase-4, whereas having no effect on the level of caspase-3. By contrast, siRNA targeting caspase-3 decreased the expression of caspase-3 significantly, whereas having no effect on caspase-4 levels. Similar results were obtained utilizing siRNA targeting caspase-12 in McA-RH 7777 cells (Fig. 3A, right panel). As can be seen in Fig. 3B, left panel, knock-down of caspase-4 prevented the cholesterol-insensitive cleavage of SREBP-1 in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF. However, knock-down of caspase-3 had no effect on SREBP-1 cleavage. Identical results were obtained with caspase-12 suppression in McA-RH 7777 cells (Fig. 3C, right panel). Caspase-cleaved SREBP-1 Is Functional—We next wanted to determine whether the cleavage product of SREBP-1 produced by caspase-4 or -12 activities in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF are transcriptionally active and can bind the SRE promoter. McA-RH 7777 and HepG2 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter vector that contains a sterol response element in the promoter. As shown in Fig. 4A and reported previously, exposure of the cells to 25 mm ethanol for 48 h markedly induced luciferase reporter activation that was inhibited by cholesterol supplementation (1You M. Fischer M. Deeg M.A. Crabb D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29342-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). TNF alone produced little activation of the luciferase reporter. However, the addition of TNF to ethanol-exposed cells rendered the increase in luciferase reporter activation insensitive to suppression by cholesterol supplementation. Importantly, the cholesterol-insensitive activation of the luciferase reporter by TNF in ethanol-exposed cells was repressed by the caspase-4 inhibitor in HepG2 cells and the caspase-12 inhibitor in the McA-RH 7777 cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, an increase in the binding of SREBP-1 to the SRE was detected in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF, in the presence or absence of cholesterol. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was a 3-fold increase of SREBP-1 binding to the SRE in ethanol-exposed cells that was prevented by cholesterol. TNF alone produced no increase in SREBP-1 binding. However, in ethanol-exposed cells, TNF at 1 ng/ml caused a 5-fold stimulation of SREBP-1 binding to the SRE. This was not altered by the presence of cholesterol but was prevented by caspase-4 and -12 inhibitors is HepG2 and McA-RH 7777 cells, respectively (Fig. 4B). Expression of the lipogenic protein, ACC, is induced by activation of SREBP-1. As shown in Fig. 4C, second and third lanes, exposure to 25 mm ethanol for 48 h increased the expression of ACC and this was repressed by cholesterol supplementation. By contrast, cholesterol was unable to prevent the induction of ACC in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF (Fig. 4C, fourth and fifth lanes). However, inhibition of caspase-4 or -12 activity by incubation with the respective caspase inhibitors prevented the cholesterol-insensitive induction of ACC expression in ethanol-exposed cells treated with TNF (Fig. 4C, sixth lane). Triglyceride synthesis induced by exposure of the cells to ethanol was also differentially sensitive to cholesterol inhibition in the absence and presence of TNF. As shown in Fig. 4D, exposure to 25 mm ethanol for 48 h provoked a 50-55% increase of triglyceride levels in McA-RH 7777 cells and HepG2 cells. Cholest"
https://openalex.org/W1977883639,"We have investigated the photosynthetic properties of Acaryochloris marina, a cyanobacterium distinguished by having a high level of chlorophyll d, which has its absorption bands shifted to the red when compared with chlorophyll a. Despite this unusual pigment content, the overall rate and thermodynamics of the photosynthetic electron flow are similar to those of chlorophyll a-containing species. The midpoint potential of both cytochrome f and the primary electron donor of photosystem I (P740) were found to be unchanged with respect to those prevailing in organisms having chlorophyll a, being 345 and 425 mV, respectively. Thus, contrary to previous reports (Hu, Q., Miyashita, H., Iwasaki, I. I., Kurano, N., Miyachi, S., Iwaki, M., and Itoh, S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 13319–13323), the midpoint potential of the electron donor P740 has not been tuned to compensate for the decrease in excitonic energy in A. marina and to maintain the reducing power of photosystem I. We argue that this is a weaker constraint on the engineering of the oxygenic photosynthetic electron transfer chain than preserving the driving force for plastoquinol oxidation by P740, via the cytochrome b6f complex. We further show that there is no restriction in the diffusion of the soluble electron carrier between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I in A. marina, at variance with plants. This difference probably reflects the simplified ultrastructure of the thylakoids of this organism, where no segregation into grana and stroma lamellae is observed. Nevertheless, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements suggest that there is energy transfer between adjacent photosystem II complexes but not from photosystem II to photosystem I, indicating spatial separation between the two photosystems. We have investigated the photosynthetic properties of Acaryochloris marina, a cyanobacterium distinguished by having a high level of chlorophyll d, which has its absorption bands shifted to the red when compared with chlorophyll a. Despite this unusual pigment content, the overall rate and thermodynamics of the photosynthetic electron flow are similar to those of chlorophyll a-containing species. The midpoint potential of both cytochrome f and the primary electron donor of photosystem I (P740) were found to be unchanged with respect to those prevailing in organisms having chlorophyll a, being 345 and 425 mV, respectively. Thus, contrary to previous reports (Hu, Q., Miyashita, H., Iwasaki, I. I., Kurano, N., Miyachi, S., Iwaki, M., and Itoh, S. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 13319–13323), the midpoint potential of the electron donor P740 has not been tuned to compensate for the decrease in excitonic energy in A. marina and to maintain the reducing power of photosystem I.

Nevertheless, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements suggest that there is energy transfer between adjacent photosystem II complexes but not from photosystem II to photosystem I, indicating spatial separation between the two photosystems. Acaryochloris marina is an unusual cyanobacterium, because it contains mainly chlorophyll (Chl) 3The abbreviations used are: ChlchlorophyllcytcytochromeDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaDBMIB2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinoneP700 and P740chlorophyll dimer bearing the long-lived cation in photosystem I in Chl a and Chl d organisms, respectivelyPCplastocyaninPSI and PSIIphotosystem I and II, respectivelyRPradical pairMKmenaquinonePQplastoquinoneMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: ChlchlorophyllcytcytochromeDCMU3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylureaDBMIB2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinoneP700 and P740chlorophyll dimer bearing the long-lived cation in photosystem I in Chl a and Chl d organisms, respectivelyPCplastocyaninPSI and PSIIphotosystem I and II, respectivelyRPradical pairMKmenaquinonePQplastoquinoneMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. d. It was first isolated from a suspension of algae squeezed out of Lissoclinum patella, a colonial ascidian (1Miyashita H. Ikemoto H. Kurano N. Adachi K. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). It mainly grows as a biofilm on the undersurface of the ascidian beneath a symbiotic layer of a Prochloron, which is in the upper tunic of the ascidian (2Kuhl M. Chen M. Ralph P.J. Schreiber U. Larkum A.W. Nature. 2005; 433: 820Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other varieties of Acaryochloris have been found on the underside of the thallus of red algae (3Murakami A. Miyashita H. Iseki M. Adachi K. Mimuro M. Science. 2004; 303: 1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and free living in a salt lake (4Miller S.R. Augustine S. Olson T.L. Blankenship R.E. Selker J. Wood A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The general feature of its habitat is that it lives at relatively low light intensities, which are enriched in the far red region of the spectrum. Therefore, its oxygenic photosynthesis provides a typical example of adaptation to specific light conditions (2Kuhl M. Chen M. Ralph P.J. Schreiber U. Larkum A.W. Nature. 2005; 433: 820Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), as evidenced by its pigment composition, where Chl d is predominant and the Chl a level is very low (5Marquardt J. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Morschel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 6Hu Q. Marquardt J. Iwasaki I. Miyashita H. Kurano N. Morschel E. Miyachi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 250-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This pigment composition contrasts with the usual high level of Chl a found in other oxygenic phototrophes, as illustrated by the absorption spectrum of a suspension of A. marina cells, which is markedly red-shifted when compared with other Chl a-containing photosynthetic organisms. The extent of the red shift of the absorption spectrum of A. marina is of similar magnitude to that observed between Chl d and a in organic solvent (e.g. methanol) (7Manning W.M. Strain H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1943; 151: 1-19Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). chlorophyll cytochrome 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone chlorophyll dimer bearing the long-lived cation in photosystem I in Chl a and Chl d organisms, respectively plastocyanin photosystem I and II, respectively radical pair menaquinone plastoquinone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. chlorophyll cytochrome 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone chlorophyll dimer bearing the long-lived cation in photosystem I in Chl a and Chl d organisms, respectively plastocyanin photosystem I and II, respectively radical pair menaquinone plastoquinone 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Not surprisingly, the unusual absorption spectrum of A. marina, due to the high level of Chl d, influences the spectroscopic signatures of the various cofactors involved in the primary photochemistry. For example, light-induced charge separation in photosystem I (PSI) is associated with a main absorption band (in the Qy region) bleaching maximally at 740 nm, indicating that the primary donor is composed of Chl d rather than Chl a. Hence, this pigment was named P740 (8Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I.I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Clearly, the energy of the quantum inducing charge separation by P740 is lower than that of P700 present in Chl a containing PSI (1.68 eV instead of 1.77 eV). This decrease by about 100 meV is significant when compared with the ∼800 meV required to drive electron transfer between the soluble electron donor to P740+ (plastocyanin) and the first soluble electron acceptor (ferredoxin). However, some specific strategies may have been developed by this organism to cope with this peculiar situation and maintain a photosynthetic activity compatible with its growth requirements. A possible rationale came from the study by Hu et al. (8Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I.I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), who measured the midpoint potential of P740 and found that it was down-shifted by about 100 mV when compared with that of P700, the primary electron donor in PSI, where only Chl a is present. On this basis, they suggested that the lower midpoint potential of P740 would compensate for the lower energy of the absorbed quantum, thereby maintaining the reducing power of the excited state. Although such a tuning of the midpoint potential of P740 would allow a similar energetic picture for the electron acceptor side of PSI in A. marina and in Chl a-containing species, it would result in a significant thermodynamic pitfall on the donor side of PSI by decreasing the free energy gap between P740+ and its electron donors. For example, the midpoint potential of cytochrome (cyt) f, in Chl a-containing organisms is in the 320–370 mV range (9Hurt E.C. Hauska G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 193-201Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 49: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (143) Google Scholar). If cyt f in A. marina has the same midpoint potential, the driving force for electron transfer between cyt f and P740+ would be slightly uphill. This would lead to the accumulation of a significant fraction of P740+ under steady state illumination, which would obviously reduce the overall photochemical efficiency by closing most of the PSI photochemical traps. Alternatively, the midpoint potential of the redox-active cofactors involved in electron donation supply to P740+ (the Rieske FeS center, cytochrome f, and plastocyanin or cyt c6) would have to be tuned to compensate for the loss in oxidizing power of P740 so as to provide a driving force for maintaining efficient electron flux through PSI. These issues are addressed in the present work. We first determined the thermodynamic equilibrium constant of the electron transfer reaction between cyt f and P740 in actively growing cells. The equilibrium constant for this reaction was found to be ∼15, showing that the midpoint potential of cyt f is about 70 mV lower than that of the P740+/P740 couple. Consistent with this, the directly measured midpoint potentials of cyt f and of the P740+/P740 couples were 345 and 425 mV, respectively, in contradiction of the previous report by Hu et al. (8Hu Q. Miyashita H. Iwasaki I.I. Kurano N. Miyachi S. Iwaki M. Itoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13319-13323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) of a midpoint potential of 335 mV for the latter. The values that we have determined are similar to those found for the analogous redox cofactors in Chl a organisms for cytochrome b6f (9Hurt E.C. Hauska G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 193-201Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11Pierre Y.

This finding raises interesting questions concerning the overall energetics of PSI-driven charge separation in A. marina, which are discussed in this paper. Growth Conditions—A. marina cells were grown under low white light illumination (5–10 microeinsteins m–2 s–1) in a modified K+ESM medium (14Keller M.D. Selvin R. Claus W. Guillard R.R.L. J.

The cyanobacterium was harvested in its midexponential phase, and the cells were resuspended in fresh medium at the desired density for experiments. Membrane Isolation—Thylakoid membranes were prepared from freshly harvested cells, which were resuspended in a medium containing 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 20–25% glycerol (W/v), 10 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm benzamidine. Cells were broken by several cycles of centrifugation in the presence of 0.1-mm glass beads (10 s), followed by a short (10 s) incubation in an ice bath. Unbroken cells were removed by a short centrifugation at 2000 × g. Thylakoid membranes were recovered from the supernatant, after an additional centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min. The final pellet was resuspended in a 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, buffer, in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2 and 2.5 mm MgCl2.

Total RNA was treated with 1 unit/μg RNA for 1 h with DNase (Promega). 350 ng of total RNA was used in a reverse transcription reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (BcaBEST RNA PCR kit version 1.1; TaKaRa), using a specific reverse primer (5′-TTAGCCCTGAACCGTAATGG-3′) to the petE genomic DNA sequence (accession number: YP_001517679), and the entire volume was added to the subsequent PCR (94 °C 30 s, 57 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min for 35 cycles) using a specific forward primer (5′-TCAAATGGGGTCTTCTACGG-3′). Spectroscopy—Absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured with a laboratory-built spectrophotometer based on a diode array (AVS-USB 200; Ocean Optics). Excitation of fluorescence was at 470 nm unless otherwise indicated. Spectroscopic analysis was performed at room temperature, using home-made pump and probe spectrophotometers. Three different set-ups were employed. The kinetics of light-induced redox changes were measured with a LED-based spectrophotometer (JTS10, Biologic, France), having a time resolution of 10 μs (Figs. 2 and 5). Actinic flashes were provided by a dye laser at 690 nm, whereas measuring flashes were provided by a white LED (Luxeon; Lumileds) fitted with appropriate interference filters (10 nm full width at half-maximum). Alternatively, a second set-up having a time resolution of 10 ns (17Béal D. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Rev. Sci. Instr. 1999; 70: 202-207Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was employed, in which the actinic flashes were provided by a dye laser at 690 nm, whereas probe flashes were generated by an optical parametric oscillator pumped by an Nd:Yag laser (Figs. 3 and 4). The third set-up was for electrochemical redox titrations, which were measured as described previously (18Li Y. Lucas M.G. Konovalova T. Abbott B. MacMillan F. Petrenko A. Sivakumar V. Wang R.

In this case, the actinic flashes were provided by a xenon flash lamp (giving saturating light pulses, 5-μs duration at half-height), passed through a Schott RG695 interference filter. Probe flashes were provided by a second xenon flash lamp (3-μs duration at half-height), filtered through a monochromator (Jobin Yvon). Titration of cyt f was performed measuring the absorption changes at 554 nm, with a base line drawn between 546 and 562 nm. Mediators were para-benzoquinone, diaminodurene, 2,5 dimethyl-benzoquinone, phenazine methosulfate, and menadione, at a concentration of 1 μm for each. Similarly, the redox potential of P740 was measured using the amplitude of the flash-induced absorption changes (at 740 nm) at various redox potentials, poised either electrochemically or chemically.FIGURE 5RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from A. marina to amplify the petE gene.

Fig. 1, A and B, shows their absorption and fluorescence spectra, respectively. The room temperature absorption spectrum is characterized by a major peak at ∼712 nm, consistent with the pigment content of this organism, where Chl d is predominant (1Miyashita H. Ikemoto H. Kurano N. Adachi K. Chihara M. Miyachi S. Nature. 1996; 383: 402Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar). A second broad peak is seen in the 600–650 nm range, consistent with the presence of significant amounts of phycobiliproteins, which together with Chl d-binding Pcb proteins, provide a light harvesting system to Acaryochloris (5Marquardt J. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Morschel E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Schiller H. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Dau H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Chen M. Quinnell R.G. Larkum A.W. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission spectra show a main peak at 724 nm at room temperature, which is shifted to 732 nm at 77 K. No significant emission from the phycobiliproteins or from detached Pcb proteins is seen, either under the conditions shown (chlorophyll-selected excitation at 470 nm; Fig. 1B) or after specific excitation of the phycobilins at 590 nm (data not shown). Thus, all of the light harvesting complexes are tightly coupled to the photochemical traps, in agreement with previous reports (22Boichenko V.A. Klimov V.V. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Photosynth. Res. 2000; 65: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Overall Photosynthetic Activity—The overall photosynthetic activity of A. marina was evaluated from the fluorescence induction curve shown in Fig. 1, C and D. The quantum yield of PSII, Fv/Fm = ((Fm – Fo)/Fm) (23Delosme R. Joliot P. Lavorel J. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1959; 249: 1409-1411Google Scholar, 24Butler W.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1978; 29: 345-378Crossref Google Scholar, 25Genty B. Briantais J.-M. Baker N.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 87-92Crossref Scopus (6803) Google Scholar) gave a typical value of ∼0.7 for Fv/Fm, which is in agreement with previous reports (20Schiller H. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Dau H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This is higher than values for other phycobilisome-containing cyanobacteria (see Ref. 26Campbell D. Hurry V. Clarke A.K. Gustafsson P. Oquist G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 667-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for a review). In these organisms, the low Fv/Fm ratio is interpreted as reflecting either the presence of sustained energy spillover from PSII to PSI (27Biggins J. Bruce D. Photosynth. Res. 1989; 20: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the loose excitonic connectivity between the phycobilisomes, or the photochemical traps (which is not the case here; see above), or the low PSII/PSI ratio (reviewed in Ref. 26Campbell D. Hurry V. Clarke A.K. Gustafsson P. Oquist G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 667-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Neither of these phenomena significantly occur in A. marina, since the large Fv/Fm is incompatible with a low amount of PSII, and the shape of the fluorescence rise, measured in the presence of the PSII inhibitor, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), is clearly sigmoidal (Fig. 1C) (also see Ref. 20Schiller H. Senger H. Miyashita H. Miyachi S. Dau H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This feature, which is commonly observed in photosynthetic eukaryotes but not in cyanobacteria, is interpreted as reflecting the progressive increase in the light harvesting capacity of a PSII photochemical unit as its PSII neighbors become photochemically inactive due to the reduction of the quinone acceptor QA (28Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 29Lavergne J. Trissl H.-W. Biophys. J. 1995; 65: 2474-2492Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Such a feature is indicative of efficient energy transfer between closed and open PSII traps, without any significant competition by energy quenching through PSI photochemistry. Another important feature of the fluorescence data shown in Fig. 1 is the large difference between the level measured under steady state (Fs), noninhibited conditions (control in Fig. 1D) and the maximum level (Fm)(+DCMU in Fig. 1D). Since Fs is expected to reflect the steady state amount of reduced QA, this finding suggests that the limiting step in the reoxidation of the plastoquinone pool (i.e. in the electron flow downstream of PSII) is in the same range as the rate of its reduction (i.e. the number of electrons transferred by PSII per unit of time). As discussed by Joliot (28Joliot P. Joliot A. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris. 1964; 258: 4622-4625Google Scholar, 30Rappaport F. Beal D. Joliot A. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this can be empirically estimated from the time required to reach ∼66% of the Fm value, in the presence of DCMU. Since this value is ∼10 ms in the present experiment (Fig. 1D), it can be deduced that the number of electrons transferred per photosynthetic chain is in the 100 s–1 range (i.e. close to the maximum rate of PQH2 oxidation in vivo) (31Finazzi G. Furia A. Barbagallo R.P. Forti G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In other words, there seems to be no severe bottleneck in electron transfer downstream of PSII in A. marina. Kinetic Features of the Electron Flow Chain—Following on from above, we investigated further the properties of the electron transfer chain by directly measuring the photochemically induced turnover of the cytochrome b6f complex. Fig. 2 shows the time course of the changes occurring at 554 nm upon excitation with a single turnover saturating flash. At this wavelength, the actinic flash induces a rapid bleaching (see Fig. 2). The recovery kinetics, to the initial (dark-adapted) level, was inhibited by addition of the plastoquinone analogue, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB) (32Trebst A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 675-715Crossref Scopus (276) Google Scholar), as expected if it reflects electron flow from PSII through the lumenal (Q0) site of the cytochrome b6f complex. Fig. 3 shows two spectra measured 100 μs and 10 ms after the last flash of a series of 10. Both spectra show pronounced bleach at 554 nm and a less pronounced one around 520 nm. Conversely, the absorption changes comprised between 100 μs and 100 ms (see difference spectrum in Fig. 3) were rather featureless, with a broad absorption increase peaking at 515 nm. The two bleaching bands, at 554 and 520 nm, are characteristic of the oxidation spectrum of c-type cytochrome (they correspond to the α and β bands of the reduced state, respectively; see Ref. 33Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Rich A. Cytochromes c: Biological Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 14-15Google Scholar). We tentatively ascribe the broad absorption change at 515 nm to an electrochromic band shift undergone by pigments embedded in the membrane upon generation of a transmembrane electric field due to PSI and PSII photochemical activity (34Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 505: 355-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no absorption changes were observed at 554 nm between 100 μs and 10 ms, suggesting that there is no contribution of the electrochromic band shift at this wavelength, indicating that this wavelength may be used with confidence to follow the redox changes of c-type cytochromes. The observation of a light-induced oxidation of one or more c-type cytochrome(s) raises the question of the identity of these oxidized redox carriers. The absorption changes shown in Figs. 2 and 3 can be taken as the signature of the oxidation of either cyt f alone or with a soluble cyt c6. The latter is known to act as a soluble electron carrier between the cyt b6f complex and PSI in some cyanobacteria (35Baymann F. Rappaport F. Joliot P. Kallas T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10570-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (see Ref. 36Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2047265005,"beta-Catenin is a multifunctional mediator of cellular signaling and an oncogene. Nuclear beta-catenin, when complexed with members of the T-cell factor (TCF)/leukocyte enhancer factor family of DNA-binding proteins, mediates transcriptional activation important for embryonic development and adult cell homeostasis. Deregulation of intracellular levels of beta-catenin is an early event in the development of a variety of cancers. We observed that the proteins silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) are negative regulators of transcription induced by the beta-catenin-TCF4 complex. Overexpression of SMRT and NCoR attenuated the transcription of beta-catenin-TCF4-specific reporter gene and of CCND1, an endogenous beta-catenin target gene. Knockdown of endogenous SMRT or NCoR by short interfering RNA augmented the beta-catenin-TCF4-mediated reporter gene expression. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown experiments showed there was a direct physical association of SMRT and NCoR with both beta-catenin and TCF4. DNA-protein interaction studies revealed that the interactions between either SMRT or NCoR and beta-catenin or TCF4 occurred at the promoter regions of CCND1 and other target genes. These findings demonstrate an important role for corepressors SMRT and NCoR in the regulation of beta-catenin-TCF4-mediated gene transcription."

We showed here that triple alanine substitution of the 419FLD421 sequence, which links the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of RhBG to ankyrin-G, not only disrupted the interaction of RhBG with the spectrin-based skeleton but also delayed its cell surface expression, decreased its plasma membrane stability, and abolished its NH3 transport function in epithelial cell lines. Similarly, we demonstrated that both anchoring to the membrane skeleton and ammonium transport activity are regulated by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal tail of RhBG. Tyrosine 429, which belongs to the previously reported YED basolateral targeting signal of RhBG, was demonstrated to be phosphorylated in vitro using purified Src and Syk kinases and ex vivo by analyzing the effect of pervanadate treatment on wild-type RhBG or Y429A mutants. Then, we showed that Y429D and Y429E mutations, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation, abolished NH3 transport and enhanced Triton X-100 solubilization of RhBG from the cell membrane. In contrast, the nonphosphorylated/nonphosphorylatable Y429A and Y429F mutants behaved the same as wild-type RhBG. Conversely, Y/A or Y/F but not Y/E or Y/D mutations of residue 429 abolished the exclusive basolateral localization of RhBG in polarized epithelial cells. All these results led to a model in which targeting and ammonium transport function of RhBG are regulated by both phosphorylation and membrane skeleton binding of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain.

Alternatively, the crystal structure of the archeal Amt-1 strongly suggested that the C terminus interacts physically with cytosolic loops of the protein (35Andrade S.L. Dickmanns A. Ficner R.

The cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of human RhBG contains several potential phosphorylation sites, Ser422, Ser426, Tyr429, and Thr456, as determined using in silico prediction programs (Fig. 1). Moreover, the extreme four C-terminal residues (DTQA), in which Thr456 is included, resemble a canonical type I PDZ-binding domain (X-Ser/Thr-X-Φ) known to regulate the polarized distribution of numerous membrane proteins in neurons and epithelial cells (38Sheng M.

The curves represent mean values from three experiments. ♦, RhBG; ▪ Y429F; ⋄, Y429E; ▵, F419A/L420A/D421A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell Culture, Transfection, Flow Cytometry, and Confocal Microscopy—Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, and murine inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD-3) cells were supplied by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDCK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Glutamax I (Invitrogen), HEK293 and mIMCD-3 cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), and all media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Dutscher, Brumath, France). Stable MDCK, HEK293, and mIMCD-3 cells expressing native or mutated RhBG proteins were obtained after transfection with the relevant expression vectors using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) and selection in culture medium supplemented with 0.6 mg/ml (MDCK) or 0.8 mg/ml (HEK293) neomycin (Geneticin, Invitrogen), or 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) for mIMCD-3 cells. RhBG-positive cells were detected by flow-cytometry using the rabbit anti-RhBG-Cter polyclonal antibody after permeabilization of the cells, as described previously (31Lopez C. Metral S. Eladari D.

At least three clones of each transfectant were grown and subsequently analyzed. Subconfluent (HEK293) or confluent (MDCK) monolayers of transfectants were cultured on poly-l-lysine coverslips or polycarbonate membranes, respectively, immunostained with the appropriate primary and Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies, and examined by confocal microscopy as described previously (31Lopez C. Metral S. Eladari D. Drevensek S. Gane P. Chambrey R. Bennett V. Cartron J.P. Le Van Kim C. Colin Y. J. Biol.

Stopped-flow Analysis—The ammonium transport function of wild-type RhBG and mutants was determined by stopped-flow spectrofluorometry analysis. Intracellular pH variation, using BCECF-AM (Sigma-Aldrich) as a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, was measured in parental and transfected HEK293 cells exposed to inwardly directed 20 mmol of ammonium (NH+4) gradients at pH 7.2, as extensively described previously (18Zidi-Yahiaoui N.

When indicated, pervanadate was added at 0.1 mm to culture medium 30 min before cell trypsinization and during each step before analysis with the stopped-flow instrument (SFM3, Bio-Logic, Grenoble, France). Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed on nitrocellulose membranes, which then were stained with Ponceau Red (0.1%) and/or incubated with relevant primary antibodies followed with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000). Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—The GST fusion proteins expressed in E. coli BL21 and TKB1 were purified by elution from glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20 mm glutathione) and quantified by absorption at 280 nm. For in vitro phosphorylation with purified kinases, 15 μg of GST-RhBG-Cter fusion protein produced in BL21 cells and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were mixed with 100 ng of Src or Syk kinase in the reaction buffer: 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT, 3 μm sodium orthovanadate, and incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (200 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Beads were washed six times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and then resuspended and boiled for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer. Samples were subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Radioactive bands corresponding to GST-RhBG-Cter were visualized using a Bio Imaging Analyser BAS-1800 II (Fujifilm-Raytest, Courbevoie, France). Protein Extraction From HEK293 or MDCK Cells and Immunoprecipitation—Wild-type or transfected cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture and usually 1% Triton X-100, or variable amounts when indicated. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of lysates were mixed with 5× loading buffer (1.25 m sucrose, 20% SDS, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue) before electrophoresis. For RhBG immunoprecipitation, lysates were submitted to preclearing by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads supplemented with 2% goat serum for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with 1 μg of purified rabbit anti-RhBG-Cter and protein A-Sepharose CL4B beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, and immunocomplexes were eluted in Laemmli buffer for 1 h at room temperature and mixed with loading buffer. Samples were electrophoresed in 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted using murine ascites A-08 (1:5,000), which is directed against the extracellular loops of RhBG. The recognition of RhBG protein, immunoprecipitated by the anti-RhBG-Cter, actually demonstrated the specificity of ascites A-08 for RhBG. Membrane Targeting Assays of RhBG Protein—Delivery of newly synthesized RhBG proteins to the membrane and their turnover were determined by performing a pulse-labeled biotin targeting assay. HEK293 cells expressing native or mutated RhBG protein were grown to confluency on 60-mm Petri dishes. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus methionine and cysteine and then incubated for 30 min in the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Newly synthesized proteins were labeled by adding 150 μCi of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (Invitrogen) in the culture medium for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in nonradioactive medium for 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 6, 10, 13, and 17 h at 37 °C. After each time, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml nonpenetrating Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) diluted in biotinylation buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of biotin, cells were incubated with 10 mm glycine for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with cold PBS. Cell lysis and immunoprecipitation of RhBG proteins were performed as described above. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, and one-fourth (200 μl) was eluted in Laemmli buffer for 1 h at room temperature (total RhBG proteins). The remaining three-fourths"

Chem. 281, 2841–2846). We used a two-pronged approach to study how discrimination of ligand is achieved in human (h)PDE10A and how domain selection in the phosphodiesterase GAF tandems is determined. First, we examined which functional groups of cAMP are responsible for purine ring discrimination. Changes at the C-6 ring position (removal of the amino group; chloride substitution) and at the N-1 ring position reduced stimulation efficacy by 80%, i.e. marking those positions as decisive for nucleotide discrimination. Second, we generated a GAF tandem chimera that consisted of the cGMP-binding GAF-A unit from hPDE5A1, which signals through cGMP in PDE5, and the GAF-B from hPDE10A1, which signals through cAMP in PDE10. Stimulation of the reporter enzyme exclusively was through the GAF-B domain of hPDE10A1 (EC50 = 7 μm cAMP) as shown by respective point mutations. The PDE5 GAF-A domain in the chimera did not signal, and its function was reduced to a strictly structural role. Signaling was independent of the origin of the N terminus. Generating 10 additional PDE5/10 tandem GAF chimeras surprisingly demonstrated that the length-conserved linker in GAF tandems between GAF-A and GAF-B played an unforeseen decisive role in intramolecular signaling. Swapping the linker sections between PDE5 and PDE10 GAF tandem domains abrogated signaling completely pointing to specific domain interactions within GAF tandems, which are not visible in the available crystal structures with bound ligands.

The second messengers cAMP and cGMP transduce extracellular stimuli into intracellular responses (1Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Obviously, efficient and precise regulation of biosynthesis and degradation of these messengers is an important issue. For this purpose a multitude of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) 2The abbreviations used are: ACadenylyl cyclasePDEphosphodiesterasehhuman. and phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is available to rapidly adjust cyclic nucleotide levels in the cell (2Hurley J.H.

In mammals 11 PDE families exist that are encoded by no less than 21 genes. Using different transcription start sites, alternative splicing, and secondary modifications, more than 50 PDE isozymes have been counted so far (5Bender A.T. Beavo J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 488-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 6Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic domains of mammalian PDEs are rather similar, the N-terminal regulatory domains differ (3Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, PDE1 has a tandem calmodulin-binding ensemble; PDE4 has a tandem arrangement of uniformly conserved regions, and PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11 have N-terminal tandem GAF domains (6Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), i.e. two GAF domains, A and B, spaced by a length, yet not the sequence conserved linker of 36 amino acids (Fig. 3B). Generally, the >4500 GAF domains that are present in all kingdoms of life are considered small molecule-binding domains. In mammals, GAF domains are exclusively found in PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11. The acronym GAF originates from proteins in which the domains were initially identified, i.e. cGMP-regulated PDEs, Anabaena ACs, and the Escherichia coli transcription factor FhlA (13Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In PDE2, -5, -6, and -11, cGMP binds to the GAF tandem, whereas cAMP binds to the PDE10 GAF tandem (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol.

Albeit individual GAF domains within a particular GAF tandem and between different mammalian PDEs share considerable sequence similarities, it is impossible to predict ligand specificity based on sequence features. In addition, in a GAF tandem the individual GAF domains in PDEs differ functionally in that only one appears to bind cyclic nucleotide and signal, whereas the other appears to be necessary to stabilize a certain structural state because halving GAF tandems abolishes signaling and regulation (13Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Bruder S. Linder J.U. Martinez S.E. Zheng N. Beavo J.A. Schultz J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This raises questions such as whether binding of cNMPs in individual GAF domains is accomplished in an identical manner or whether chimeras consisting of signaling GAF-A and -B units from different PDEs retain both functionalities. First, we characterized the specificity for cAMP signaling in the PDE10 GAF tandem using structural analogues. Second, we generated chimeric GAF tandems from GAF-A PDE5, which signals via cGMP, and GAF-B of PDE10, which signals via cAMP. In using the cyanobacterial AC CyaB1 as an established reporter enzyme, we avoided the problem that substrate and allosteric activator are identical (15Kanacher T. Schultz A. Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3672-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We obtained partially functional chimeras and, surprisingly, found that the linker between the GAF-A and -B domains appears directly involved in signaling. Recombinant DNAs—The cyaB1 gene (gi: 15553050) was from Dr. Ohmori (University of Tokyo), hPDE5A1_2 (gi: 61744434) from Dr. Friebe (University of Bochum), and a cDNA clone of hPDE10A1 (gi: 4894715) from Dr. Quintini (Nycomed, Konstanz, Germany). All numbering refers to these genes. For generation of chimeric and PDE5/PDE10 tandem GAF domains, each tandem was subdivided into four segments. These were as follows: PDE5A1 N terminus, 5N, residues 1–143; GAF-A, 5A, 144–310; linker region between GAF-A and GAF-B, 5L, 311–346; and GAF-B, 5B, 347–513. The corresponding segments of PDE10A1 were as follows: 10N, 14–72; 10A, 73–230; 10L, 231–266; and 10B, 267–422. The catalytic domain of CyaB1 included residues 386–859, which is abbreviated as AC. These shorthand designations will be used throughout. The chimeras of PDE5 GAF/CyaB1 AC and PDE10 GAF/CyaB1 AC were used as templates (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A.

For construct 10N-5A-10L-10B-AC, 5A was amplified by PCR and inserted via KpnI/StuI restriction sites, which were introduced by the primers, into PDE10 GAF/CyaB1 AC in pRSET A (the KpnI site in the plasmid was removed). The construct was then transferred into PDE10 GAF/CyaB1 AC via NheI/StuI sites. For 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC, we amplified the 5L-5A by PCR and inserted it via BamHI/BglII and StuI sites into PDE10 GAF/CyaB1 AC in pRSET A. The D299A and D397A mutants of this chimera were generated using available PDE5- and PDE10-CyaB1 constructs with the respective Ala mutations and BamHI/BglII and StuI restriction sites. The chimera 5N-5A-5L-10B-AC was made by a fusion PCR with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) using respective sense and antisense primers (from MWG Biotec, Ebersberg, Germany) and cloning into the BamHI/BsrGI sites of 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC. The resulting chimera was used to clone 10N-5A-5L-10B-AC via AfeI/SpeI sites using a correspondingly digested 10N-5A-10L-10B-AC construct. For the chimera 10N-10A-5L-5B-AC, we amplified 10N-10A and 5L-5B by PCR and joined them via a NaeI site. This intermediate was linked to CyaB1 via NotI/SalI in pBluescript II SK(–) and then transferred via XhoI/EcoRV sites into PDE10 GAF/CyaB1 AC in pRSET A. Starting from this chimera and using respective sense and antisense primers in fusion PCRs, we generated via NheI/ApaI restriction 5N-10A-5L-5B-AC. For 10N-10A-10L-5B-AC, we amplified 10N-10A-10L by PCR and joined ends via an XbaI site in 10N-10A-5L-5B-AC in pRSET A. For 5N-5A-10L-5B-AC, we digested 10N-10A-10L-5B-AC with StuI/SpeI and inserted the resulting fragment into an identically restricted 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC in pRSET A. The linker in PDE10 was replaced by the one from PDE5 by restriction of 5N-5A-5L-10B-AC by BlpI/HindIII and ligation with a correspondingly digested fragment of 10N-10A in pBluescript II SK(–). This intermediate construct then replaced the respective part in PDE10A GAF/CyaB1 in pRSET A via BamHI/SphI restriction sites. Thus we obtained 10N-10A-5L-10B-AC. All constructs had a N-terminal MRGS(H)6 affinity tag via the expression plasmid pRSET A (Invitrogen). The fidelity of all sequences was checked by DNA sequencing. A list of the primer sequences is available on request. Schemes of the above described chimeras are depicted in Fig. 1. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Expression was in E. coli BL21 (DE3)[pRep4] grown in Luria-Bertani medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Induction was with 200 μm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside at an A600 of about 0.6. Cells were grown in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 at 24 °C for 5–7 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 4100 × g, 4 °C), washed once with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (4 °C), collected by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C. Cells were broken at 4 °C with a French press at 1000 p.s.i. in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Diagnostics)). The homogenate was centrifuged (41,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with 0.25 ml of Profinity™ IMAC nickel-charged resin (Bio-Rad) for 2–4 h on ice. The affinity material was poured into a mini-column and successively washed twice with 6 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 20% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 35 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), twice with 4 ml of buffer B (buffer A + 55 mm imidazole), and twice with 4 ml of buffer C (buffer A with 10 mm NaCl and 75 mm imidazole). Protein elution was with 0.3 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was immediately dialyzed for at least 2 h (4 °C) against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 35% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. Proteins were stored at –20 °C. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured for 10 min in a volume of 100 μl at 37 °C (17Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar), The reactions contained 22% glycerol, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50–150 ng of recombinant protein, and 75 μm [α-32P]ATP (25 kBq; Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). [2,8-3H]cAMP (150 Bq; GE Healthcare) was added after the reaction stop to monitor yield during product isolation. The reaction was started by addition of ATP. ATP conversion was limited to less than 10% to guarantee linearity. We consistently examined reaction kinetics of the reporter AC under all conditions. cNMP additions did not affect Km values for ATP but altered Vmax. Values are means ± S.E. of 4–6 experiments. A t test was used for statistical evaluation. Cyclic nucleotide analogues were purchased from BioLog (Bremen, Germany). Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were mixed with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5%). Proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with an anti-RGS-H4- (Qiagen) and with a 1:5000 dilution of a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Peroxidase detection was with the ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare). Western blots of affinity-purified proteins are depicted to visualize the presence of intact constructs. N-terminally degraded proteins would not have bound to the affinity material. C-terminally truncated proteins, which occasionally were present, are catalytically inactive, i.e. Western blots faithfully showed the amount of active proteins. Activation of hPDE10-GAF Tandem CyaB1 Adenylyl Cyclase Chimera by Cyclic Purine Nucleotides—So far, six N- and C-terminal PDE10 splice variants have been detected in humans with PDE10A1 and -A2 being the major isoforms. Both are identical starting from Leu-14. Therefore, we used Leu-14 as the start of the PDE10 N terminus. hPDE10A1-(14–422)/CyaB1-(386–859) AC (Fig. 2A) had been used to identify cAMP as a ligand (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We used this chimera to examine seven cyclic purine monophosphates for their potency to activate the GAF tandem domain to identify functional groups at the cAMP moiety, which affect cyclic nucleotide binding affinity or discrimination. All cAMP analogues were less potent (10–83%) to stimulate the CyaB1 AC than cAMP itself (Fig. 2B). Dose-response curves up to 300 μm indicated three groups of compounds (Fig. 2B). cAMP and 7-deaza-cAMP (7-CH-cAMP) were nearly equipotent; the calculated EC50 concentrations were 30 μm. This showed the absence of major interactions between N-7 of the imidazole ring and indicated that preferentially the pyrimidine ring is involved in ligand selection. Equipotent were 2-chloro-cAMP and 2′-deoxy-cAMP which, however, stimulated significantly less over the entire concentration range. The EC50 concentrations increased significantly to 100 μm. The 2-position is a critical spot for ligand discrimination because cGMP has an amino group at this position. The loss of efficacy of 2-chloro-cAMP probably was because of steric hindrance by the substituent rather than to the slight electron withdrawing effect. The removal of the 2′-hydroxyl from the ribose considerably reduced potency indicating that the ribose entity contributed to the overall binding energy, although it is not involved in ligand discrimination as this position is identical in all cyclic nucleotides. This is in agreement with the observed H-bonding to Thr-364 observed in the recent crystal structure (18Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M. Morita S. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Akasaka R. Omori K.

The third group of compounds, 1-NO-cAMP, 6-Cl-cPuMP, cPuMP, and 2-amino-cPuMP, stimulated the attached reporter enzyme even less, and EC50 concentrations could not be calculated (Fig. 2B). Removal of the 6-amino group (cPuMP) or its replacement by chlorine (6-Cl-cPuMP) highlighted the crucial importance of the 6-NH2 group. This amino group thus appeared to be the expected crucial discriminator between cAMP and cGMP, which has a carbonyl function at this position (cGMP itself was inactive). Modification of the N-1 position (1-NO-cAMP) had a similarly strong effect (Fig. 2B) probably because this dramatically altered the charge distribution around this critical region and abolished a position for a hydrogen bond. 2-Amino-cPuMP was even less effective than the 2-chloro-cAMP. Because both substituents have approximately the same size, the steric impediment should be identical. The 2-amino group most likely released electrons into the amidine structure resulting in reduced affinity. This demonstrated that the 6-amino function cannot be shifted to the 2-ring position. Cyclic inosine and cyclic xanthosine monophosphates had no activity (not shown). In these compounds the charge distribution around the pyrimidine ring is altered because of the lack of the amino substituent (inosine) or the additional oxygen (xanthosine). Characterization of PDE5/PDE10/CyaB1 Chimeras—12 of 14 individual GAF domains in mammalian PDEs share an NKFDE motif that has been implicated in formation of the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket (3Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19969-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This motif is present in either GAF domain of the PDE5 tandem. In the PDE10 GAF tandem, only the B-domain has an NKFDE motif, whereas in GAF-A these positions are RHFHQ (Fig. 3A) (13Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Mutational studies of the NKFDE motif established that PDE5 signals via GAF-A and PDE10 via GAF-B (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Sopory S. Balaji S. Srinivasan N. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, the question was whether a chimera, which consists of the cGMP-signaling GAF-A from PDE5 and the cAMP-signaling GAF-B domain from PDE10, could be stimulated by cGMP and cAMP. In view of the important role of the N termini in signaling of GAF tandem domains, we designed 11 PDE5/PDE10 GAF tandem chimeras to individually examine the contribution to intramolecular signal transduction (Fig. 1). In 10N-5A-10L-10B-AC, GAF-A from hPDE10A1 was replaced by the one from hPDE5A1 (Fig. 4A). The affinity-purified protein had a basal activity of 3.6 ± 0.4 nmol of cAMP·mg–1·min–1. AC activity was stimulated mainly by cAMP (7.3 ± 0.6-fold), whereas cGMP was much less potent (3.8 ± 0.3-fold; Fig. 4A). The EC50 for cAMP was 7.2 ± 0.3 μm, compared with 18.1 ± 1.0 for the PDE10-tandem GAF (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For cGMP, no EC50 concentration could be determined. On one hand, the data were surprising in that such a chimera could be stimulated at all. On the other hand, they were disappointing because the PDE5 GAF-A domain, which is responsible for cGMP binding and signaling, apparently was not functional. In the next chimera, the N terminus of hPDE5A1 was introduced into the former one (5N-5A-10L-10B-AC; see Fig. 4B). This did not affect the stimulation by cAMP and cGMP. cAMP stimulated 4.9 ± 0.5-fold and cGMP 2.5 ± 0.2-fold. The EC50 concentration for cAMP remained at 7.0 ± 1.7 μm. A major difference was an increase in basal activity indicating that the N terminus of the GAF domain probably interacted with the C-terminal catalytic domain as reported previously. To rule out that the differences were because of changes in enzymatic properties, Km values derived from a Lineweaver-Burk plot (19.9 ± 1.4 and 21.9 ± 2.6 μm ATP, respectively) and Hill coefficients (both <1) were determined. These values are almost identical to the Km values of the parent constructs PDE5-GAF/CyaB1 AC (21.2 ± 1.4 μm ATP) and PDE10-GAF/CyaB1 AC (22.2 ± 1.2 μm ATP). To probe whether cAMP and the minor cGMP stimulation were mediated exclusively by the PDE10 GAF-B subdomain, we introduced a D397A mutation into PDE10A1 GAF-B of the 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC, which is known to abrogate cAMP signaling in a PDE10-GAF/CyaB1 AC construct (see Fig. 4B for scheme and inset for data) (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The D397A mutation in 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC led to a drastic reduction of cyclase activation by cAMP (EC50 = 144 ± 66.4 μm) and abolished stimulation by cGMP (Fig. 4B, inset). This point was further corroborated by using a D299A mutation in 5A of 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC. The activation by cAMP (EC50 = 17.5. ± 7.5 μm) was unaffected as was the minor effect of cGMP strongly indicating signaling via 10B in 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC. It is known that phosphorylation of Ser-102 in the PDE5 N terminus leads to an enhancement of cGMP signaling (16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19969-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Therefore, a 5N-S102D-5A-10L-10B-AC construct was generated. AC activation by cAMP and cGMP as examined with the recombinant protein was not different from the parent in 5N-5A-10L-10B-AC protein. This result indicated that 5N could not productively interact with 10B in a manner comparable with the PDE5 GAF tandem and suggested again that 5N-5A in this construct was devoid of an intrinsic biochemical function. Because the Km value of the cyclase in these constructs (22.8 ± 5.2 μm ATP) was not affected, this showed that the major stimulation by cAMP and the minor one by cGMP in the parent chimera were both mediated via the GAF-B domain of PDE10, whereas the PDE5 GAF-A domain did not signal and probably was reduced to a strictly structural role because cyclase chimeras with only a single GAF domain are not regulated (16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19969-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next we replaced in the PDE5 GAF tandem GAF-B with that from PDE10, i.e. generating 5N-5A-5L-10B-AC (Fig. 4C). The recombinant protein had an increased basal activity (Fig. 1), yet, surprisingly, it was stimulated by neither cyclic nucleotide (Fig. 4C). A similar construct that carried the N terminus from PDE10, 10N-5A-5L-10B-AC, was also not stimulated by cAMP or by cGMP (basal activity 62.8 ± 10.7 nmol cAMP·mg–1·min–1; n = 6; data not shown). Additional control constructs were 10N-10A-5L-5B-AC, 5N-10A-5L-5B-AC, and 10N-10A-10L-5B-AC, i.e. constructs that carried GAF-A of PDE10 and GAF-B of PDE5, which are not cyclic nucleotide binding, respectively. The resulting recombinant proteins could not be stimulated. This was independent of the origin of the N terminus or the linker between the individual GAF domains (data not shown). Because the above data attributed a particular role to the origin of the linker region within the tandem, we generated two further chimeras as follows: (i) the PDE10 GAF tandem containing the PDE5 linker (10N-10A-5L-10B-AC), and (ii) the PDE5 GAF tandem containing the PDE10 linker (5N-5A-10L-5B-AC; Fig. 5). Both constructs had reasonable basal AC activities (Fig. 5), and yet both were not activated by cAMP or cGMP (Fig. 5) emphasizing the importance of the linker within the GAF tandem. In fact, cGMP appeared to be slightly inhibitory with a calculated IC50 of 12 μm. To date, the structures of a PDE2 tandem GAF domain with cGMP, the CyaB2 tandem GAF domain with cAMP, and a homodimer of the GAF-B from PDE10 with bound cAMP are publicly available (18Handa N.

In all instances, ligands are deeply buried in a pocket in these proteins with less than 10% of the ligand surface solvent-accessible. This implies that to bind or release the ligands, these domains must open. Because no empty structure of a PDE tandem GAF was available, we do not know how much the contacts visible in the resolved structures contribute to purine discrimination. Irrespective of these uncertainties, we used cNMP analogues to identify functional groups of the ligand that are used for purine discrimination by the PDE10 GAF tandem. The region around N-1 and N6 is most important as follows: (i) N-1, because first, N-1 extends a hydrogen bond to Arg-286, which cannot form with the 1-N-oxide cAMP, and, second, probably because of the electron withdrawing effect of the N-oxide, which affected the neighboring N6 group; and (ii) N6, because its removal as in cPuMP or a shift to the 2-position as in 2-amino-cPuMP or its replacement with a chlorine as in 6-Cl-cPuMP disrupted formation of an H-bond to the main chain carbonyl of Cys-287 (18Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M. Morita S. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Akasaka R. Omori K. Kotera J. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19657-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the data confirmed and extended the novel structural data (18Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M. Morita S. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Akasaka R. Omori K. Kotera J. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19657-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This agreement extends to the minor cross-reactivity of cGMP, which apparently binds with much less affinity because it lacks these specific H-bond interactions in the binding pocket and therefore the entropy loss is rather small. The 2-position appeared to discriminate against cGMP and favor cAMP possibly via steric hindrance because 2-substitution with an amino group (same as in cGMP) or chlorine significantly reduced potency (Fig. 2). These effects are not readily explained by recent structural data as the available space appears to be sufficient to accommodate these side chains (18Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M. Morita S. Uchikubo-Kamo T. Akasaka R. Omori K. Kotera J. Terada T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19657-19664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The 7-nitrogen (7-CH-cAMP) or the ribose ring (2′-dcAMP) appeared to be less important for purine ring discrimination. The above interpretation appears to agree with available structural data of the binding pocket that identified C-6 and N-1 as main interaction sites (18Handa N. Mizohata E. Kishishita S. Toyama M.

However, this may reflect more the differences in loss of entropy once the ligand is buried in the binding pocket than the actual process of ligand discrimination. PDE5 specifically hydrolyzes cGMP. It is allosterically activated by its substrate cGMP that binds to GAF-A (8Rybalkin S.D. Rybalkina I.G. Shimizu-Albergine M. Tang X.B. Beavo J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). PDE5, which is prevalent in skeletal and smooth muscle, brain, kidney, lung, heart, and platelets, is the target of sildenafil and similar drugs (5Bender A.T. Beavo J.A. Pharmacol.

PDE10, which is prominent in testes, thyroid, putamen, and nucleus caudatus (27Fujishige K. Kotera J. Michibata H. Yuasa K. Takebayashi S. Okumura K. Omori K. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 7071-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), is a dual specificity enzyme that hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP about equally well. It is activated by cAMP that binds to the GAF-B domain (5Bender A.T. Beavo J.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2006; 58: 488-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the cAMP-binding GAF-B domain of hPDE10 shares 44.7% sequence identity with the cGMP-binding GAF-A of hPDE5 (13Zoraghi R. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, one might have envisaged that combining a cGMP-binding GAF-A from hPDE5 with a rather similar cAMP-binding GAF-B from hPDE10 might result in a chimera that is stimulated equally well by both second messengers. This was not the case. Only GAF-B from PDE10 in the tandem was able to activate the reporter AC, mediating the cAMP and the minor cGMP responses with an efficiency comparable with the PDE10 tandem (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Thus, the PDE5/PDE10 GAF tandem chimera follows the known pattern in PDEs in that only one domain of the GAF tandem signals, whereas the other apparently has an indispensable structural role. Only the GAF tandem of the CyaB2 AC appears to signal via both subunits as demonstrated by structural and biochemical data (14Bruder S. Linder J.U. Martinez S.E. Zheng N. Beavo J.A. Schultz J.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2008; 275: 1643-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we note that the basal activities of different constructs vary considerably. Thus, one may argue that the expression of the chimeras may result in polypeptides that are different, both structurally and functionally, from the wild-type constructs due to, for example, aberrant folding or domain assembly. There are several reasons to discount this argument. First, already the parent constructs, PDE5-AC and PDE10-AC, differ in basal activities 4.3-fold. Second, throughout Km and Vmax values were determined. We consistently found that Km constants were essentially identical. This provided strong evidence that the catalytic function of CyaB1 was not affected in any chimera as reported earlier (7Gross-Langenhoff M. Hofbauer K. Weber J. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2841-2846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19969-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Third, class III ACs such as CyaB1 are only active as dimers. All constructs examined here had very reasonable AC activity. This indicated a correct and productive dimerization process, i.e. the correct quaternary structure of the dimers was maintained throughout. Fourth, as usual, the extent of protein purity after affinity purification was slightly variable, and these differences may be magnified in the assays. Finally, we statistically evaluated the basal activities of 66 different constructs of mammalian PDE GAF tandem domains and the CyaB1 AC that were generated in recent years, including all reported here. Mean basal activity was 20.3 ± 2.7 nmol of cAMP/mg·min–1 (S.E.). The above arguments and the statistical mean of basal activities of very many constructs focus the discussion on the extent and mechanism of cNMP stimulation of these chimeras and do not raise concerns about remote possibilities such as partially folded proteins. The above arguments do not fully exclude the possibility that elevated basal activities might, at least in part, reflect the relief of an inhibitory function associated with one or more of the structural elements in the regulatory domain of the GAF-PDEs (e.g. see Ref. 23Zoraghi R. Bessay E.P. Corbin J.D. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12051-12063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another interesting point to note is that most of the high basal activity mutants have the PDE5 linker (5L) incorporated with the PDE10 GAF domains (particularly 10B). Our data imply that interactions between the two GAF domains for the mammalian PDE2, -5, -6, -10, and -11 play an important yet mechanistically not fully understood role in signaling. In this study, the PDE5-GAF-A domain obviously was able to substitute the structural role that is usually played by the PDE10-GAF-A unit, yet it lost its own signaling capability. Similarly, the PDE5 N terminus did not affect signaling anymore as demonstrated by the lack of an effect in the phosphomimetic S102D mutant. Such a mutation in the PDE5 GAF tandem increases cGMP affinity as does phosphorylation of this serine (16Bruder S. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19969-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2760-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The finding that the source of the linker between GAF-A and -B is very important was unexpected (compare data in Figs. 4 and 5) because the linkers are length-conserved in the seven known tandem GAF domains (Fig. 3B). Obviously the sequence differences in the linkers determine essential interactions between upstream and downstream GAF domains. Therefore, in the PDE5 GAF tandem, the 36-amino acid-long linker of PDE10 was not a functional equivalent. Similarly, although PDE5 signals via GAF-A, replacement of its GAF-B by that from PDE10 blocked signal transmission, i.e. PDE10 GAF-B did not operate as a structural substitute for PDE5 GAF-B. These complicated interdomain interactions are not apparent from the two GAF tandem structures available so far. One reason may be that only structures with cNMPs bound into the binding pockets are available, i.e. which are in the signaling or on-state. The transition to the off-state without bound ligand may provide a clue about the importance of the linker between GAF-A and -B. It was also notable that we did not observe a gain in function in chimeras between the inactive GAF domains of PDE5 and -10, i.e. PDE10 GAF-A and PDE5 GAF-B, although the latter carried an unabridged NKFDE motif considered essential for ligand binding and signaling (see Fig. 1 for scheme; data not shown). This demonstrated that the NKFDE motif might be necessary for formation of a correct cyclic nucleotide binding pocket, yet its presence alone is not sufficient for cyclic nucleotide binding and signaling."
