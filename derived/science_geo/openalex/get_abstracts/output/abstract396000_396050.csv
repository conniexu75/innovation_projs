https://openalex.org/W2101035019,"Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells, and its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here we report the massively parallel sequencing of 38 tumour genomes and their comparison to matched normal DNAs. Several new and unexpected oncogenic mechanisms were suggested by the pattern of somatic mutation across the data set. These include the mutation of genes involved in protein translation (seen in nearly half of the patients), genes involved in histone methylation, and genes involved in blood coagulation. In addition, a broader than anticipated role of NF-κB signalling was indicated by mutations in 11 members of the NF-κB pathway. Of potential immediate clinical relevance, activating mutations of the kinase BRAF were observed in 4% of patients, suggesting the evaluation of BRAF inhibitors in multiple myeloma clinical trials. These results indicate that cancer genome sequencing of large collections of samples will yield new insights into cancer not anticipated by existing knowledge. Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, remains incurable and is poorly understood. Chapman et al. have used next-generation sequencing to compare 38 multiple myeloma genomes with those of normal cells from the same patients. The disease involves mutations of genes with roles in protein translation, histone methylation and blood coagulation. In terms of clinically relevant findings, unexpected activating mutations were found in the kinase BRAF, inhibitors of which have recently shown dramatic clinical activity. This suggests that BRAF inhibitors should be evaluated in patients with BRAF-mutated multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells, remains incurable and is poorly understood. Using next-generation sequencing of several multiple myeloma genomes reveals that this disease involves mutations of genes involved in protein translation, histone methylation and blood coagulation. The study suggests that BRAF inhibitors should be evaluated in multiple myeloma clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W2074329146,"Transgenic zebrafish carrying the human oncogene BRAF(V600E), the most common mutation in melanoma patients, provide a convenient model for melanoma. Two papers from Leonard Zon and colleagues demonstrate the potential of this system in the study of cancer genetics and in drug development. Ceol et al. screen for genes that cooperate with mutated BRAF, and identify SETDB1 as capable of accelerating melanoma formation in fish. The gene is found in a region that is frequently amplified in human melanomas, and its gene product, SETDB1, is a histone methylating enzyme that is often overexpressed in those melanomas. This work establishes SETDB1 as an important oncogene. White et al. find expression of a gene signature in melanoma-susceptible zebrafish embryos that is indicative of disrupted differentiation of neural crest progenitors. A chemical screen identifies leflunomide, an immunomodulatory drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, as an inhibitor of neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide has antimelanoma activity in human melanoma xenografts and might prove useful as an anticancer drug, particularly in combination with BRAF inhibitors. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma, this study has searched for genes that can cooperate with mutated BRAF, a frequent oncogenic event in human melanomas. It is found that SETDB1 can accelerate melanoma formation in fish and resides in a region frequently amplified in human melanomas. SETDB1, a histone methylating enzyme, is also frequently overexpressed in human melanomas and functions at least in part by regulating the expression of HOX genes. The most common mutation in human melanoma, BRAF(V600E), activates the serine/threonine kinase BRAF and causes excessive activity in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway1,2. BRAF(V600E) mutations are also present in benign melanocytic naevi3, highlighting the importance of additional genetic alterations in the genesis of malignant tumours. Such changes include recurrent copy number variations that result in the amplification of oncogenes4,5. For certain amplifications, the large number of genes in the interval has precluded an understanding of the cooperating oncogenic events. Here we have used a zebrafish melanoma model to test genes in a recurrently amplified region of chromosome 1 for the ability to cooperate with BRAF(V600E) and accelerate melanoma. SETDB1, an enzyme that methylates histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9), was found to accelerate melanoma formation significantly in zebrafish. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing and gene expression analyses uncovered genes, including HOX genes, that are transcriptionally dysregulated in response to increased levels of SETDB1. Our studies establish SETDB1 as an oncogene in melanoma and underscore the role of chromatin factors in regulating tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2135185213,"Three papers in this issue of Nature report on the modENCODE initiative, which aims to characterize functional DNA elements in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Kharchenko et al. present a genome-wide chromatin landscape of the fruitfly, based on 18 histone modifications. They describe nine prevalent chromatin states. Integrating these analyses with other data types reveals individual characteristics of different genomic elements. Graveley et al. have used RNA-Seq, tiling microarrays and cDNA sequencing to explore the transcriptome in 30 distinct developmental stages of the fruitfly. Among the results are scores of new genes, coding and non-coding transcripts, as well as splicing and editing events. Finally, Nègre et al. have produced a map of the regulatory part of the fruitfly genome, defining a vast array of putative regulatory elements, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers. As part of the modENCODE initiative, which aims to characterize functional DNA elements in D. melanogaster and C. elegans, this study created a map of the regulatory part of the fruitfly genome. On the basis of the developmental dynamics of chromatin modifications, polymerase and transcription factor occupancy this work defines a vast array of putative regulatory elements, such as enhancers, promoters, insulators and silencers. This resource represents the first attempt at a comprehensive annotation of cis-regulatory elements in a metazoan genome. Systematic annotation of gene regulatory elements is a major challenge in genome science. Direct mapping of chromatin modification marks and transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide1,2 has successfully identified specific subtypes of regulatory elements3. In Drosophila several pioneering studies have provided genome-wide identification of Polycomb response elements4, chromatin states5, transcription factor binding sites6,7,8,9, RNA polymerase II regulation8 and insulator elements10; however, comprehensive annotation of the regulatory genome remains a significant challenge. Here we describe results from the modENCODE cis-regulatory annotation project. We produced a map of the Drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome on the basis of more than 300 chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets for eight chromatin features, five histone deacetylases and thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors at different stages of development. Using these data we inferred more than 20,000 candidate regulatory elements and validated a subset of predictions for promoters, enhancers and insulators in vivo. We identified also nearly 2,000 genomic regions of dense transcription factor binding associated with chromatin activity and accessibility. We discovered hundreds of new transcription factor co-binding relationships and defined a transcription factor network with over 800 potential regulatory relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2031095563,"Cytokines are important modulators of lymphocytes, and both interleukin-21 (IL-21) and IL-6 have proposed roles in T follicular helper (Tfh) differentiation, and directly act on B cells. Here we investigated the absence of IL-6 alone, IL-21 alone, or the combined lack of IL-6 and IL-21 on Tfh differentiation and the development of B cell immunity in vivo. C57BL/6 or IL-21(-/-) mice were treated with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against IL-6 throughout the course of an acute viral infection (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCMV). The combined absence of IL-6 and IL-21 resulted in reduced Tfh differentiation and reduced Bcl6 protein expression. In addition, we observed that these cytokines had a large impact on antigen-specific B cell responses. IL-6 and IL-21 collaborate in the acute T-dependent antiviral antibody response (90% loss of circulating antiviral IgG in the absence of both cytokines). In contrast, we observed reduced germinal center formation only in the absence of IL-21. Absence of IL-6 had no impact on germinal centers, and combined absence of both IL-21 and IL-6 revealed no synergistic effect on germinal center B cell development. Studying CD4 T cells in vitro, we found that high IL-21 production was not associated with high Bcl6 or CXCR5 expression. TCR stimulation of purified naïve CD4 T cells in the presence of IL-6 also did not result in Tfh differentiation, as determined by Bcl6 or CXCR5 protein expression. Cumulatively, our data indicates that optimal Tfh formation requires IL-21 and IL-6, and that cytokines alone are insufficient to drive Tfh differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2166996710,"Melanoma is a tumour of transformed melanocytes, which are originally derived from the embryonic neural crest. It is unknown to what extent the programs that regulate neural crest development interact with mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in human melanoma. We have used zebrafish embryos to identify the initiating transcriptional events that occur on activation of human BRAF(V600E) (which encodes an amino acid substitution mutant of BRAF) in the neural crest lineage. Zebrafish embryos that are transgenic for mitfa:BRAF(V600E) and lack p53 (also known as tp53) have a gene signature that is enriched for markers of multipotent neural crest cells, and neural crest progenitors from these embryos fail to terminally differentiate. To determine whether these early transcriptional events are important for melanoma pathogenesis, we performed a chemical genetic screen to identify small-molecule suppressors of the neural crest lineage, which were then tested for their effects on melanoma. One class of compound, inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), for example leflunomide, led to an almost complete abrogation of neural crest development in zebrafish and to a reduction in the self-renewal of mammalian neural crest stem cells. Leflunomide exerts these effects by inhibiting the transcriptional elongation of genes that are required for neural crest development and melanoma growth. When used alone or in combination with a specific inhibitor of the BRAF(V600E) oncogene, DHODH inhibition led to a marked decrease in melanoma growth both in vitro and in mouse xenograft studies. Taken together, these studies highlight developmental pathways in neural crest cells that have a direct bearing on melanoma formation."
https://openalex.org/W2087955215,"A substantial proportion of lung cancers in non-smokers are associated with mutations in EGFR, the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as erlotinib are used to treat such tumours, but not all patients respond and some even develop resistance. Now, an RNA interference screen for modifiers of the EGFR inhibitor response suggests a potential strategy for improving lung cancer therapy. The screen reveals that inhibition of CD95/Fas and NF- B signalling enhances the response to EGRF inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. In patients with lung cancer who are treated with EGFR inhibitors, expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB is associated with a better response and longer survival, suggesting that combining NF-κB pathway and EGFR inhibitors may prove clinically useful. Lung cancers with activating mutations in EGFR can be treated with EGFR inhibitors, but not all tumours respond and some develop resistance. In an RNAi screen, this study searches for modifiers of the EGFR inhibitor response. It is found that inhibition of FAS and NF-κB signalling enhances the response in vitro and in vivo. In a cohort of lung cancer patients treated with EGFR inhibitors, expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB is associated with a better response and longer survival, indicating that combining NF-κB pathway and EGFR inhibitors may prove clinically useful. Human lung adenocarcinomas with activating mutations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) often respond to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but the magnitude of tumour regression is variable and transient1,2. This heterogeneity in treatment response could result from genetic modifiers that regulate the degree to which tumour cells are dependent on mutant EGFR. Through a pooled RNA interference screen, we show that knockdown of FAS and several components of the NF-κB pathway specifically enhanced cell death induced by the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. Activation of NF-κB through overexpression of c-FLIP or IKK (also known as CFLAR and IKBKB, respectively), or silencing of IκB (also known as NFKBIA), rescued EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells from EGFR TKI treatment. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis in erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant lung cancer models. Increased expression of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB predicted for improved response and survival in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients treated with EGFR TKI. These data identify NF-κB as a potential companion drug target, together with EGFR, in EGFR-mutant lung cancers and provide insight into the mechanisms by which tumour cells escape from oncogene dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1984202832,"Mammalian brains generate internal activity independent of environmental stimuli. Internally generated states may bring about distinct cortical processing modes. To investigate how brain state impacts cortical circuitry, we recorded intracellularly from the same neurons, under anesthesia and subsequent wakefulness, in rat barrel cortex. In every cell examined throughout layers 2-6, wakefulness produced a temporal pattern of synaptic inputs differing markedly from those under anesthesia. Recurring periods of synaptic quiescence, prominent under anesthesia, were abolished by wakefulness, which produced instead a persistently depolarized state. This switch in dynamics was unaffected by elimination of afferent synaptic input from thalamus, suggesting that arousal alters cortical dynamics by neuromodulators acting directly on cortex. Indeed, blockade of noradrenergic, but not cholinergic, pathways induced synaptic quiescence during wakefulness. We conclude that global brain states can switch local recurrent networks into different regimes via direct neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W2057117951,"Alkenes are found in many biologically active molecules, and there are a large number of chemical transformations in which alkenes act as the reactants or products (or both) of the reaction. Many alkenes exist as either the E or the higher-energy Z stereoisomer. Catalytic procedures for the stereoselective formation of alkenes are valuable, yet methods enabling the synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted Z alkenes are scarce. Here we report catalytic Z-selective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal enol ethers, which have not been reported previously, and of allylic amides, used until now only in E-selective processes. The corresponding disubstituted alkenes are formed in up to >98% Z selectivity and 97% yield. These transformations, promoted by catalysts that contain the highly abundant and inexpensive metal molybdenum, are amenable to gram-scale operations. Use of reduced pressure is introduced as a simple and effective strategy for achieving high stereoselectivity. The utility of this method is demonstrated by its use in syntheses of an anti-oxidant plasmalogen phospholipid, found in electrically active tissues and implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, and the potent immunostimulant KRN7000. The Z-alkene bond is one of the most important chemical bonds in nature. Many natural products contain one or several Z alkenes, consisting of a double bond with two substituents at each end pointing in the same direction. The potency or function of these natural products disappears or changes significantly if the two substituents point in opposite directions — a structure called an E alkene. Convenient methods for the stereoselective synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted Z alkenes are scarce. Amir Hoveyda and colleagues now describe catalytic Z-selective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal enol ethers and allylic amides, previously used only in E-selective processes. The potential of this reaction is demonstrated by its use in syntheses of antioxidant plasmalogen phospholipids found in electronically active tissues and implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and the potent immunostimulant and antitumour agent KRN7000. There are a large number of chemical transformations in which alkenes act as the reactants and/or the products of the reaction, but methods enabling the facile synthesis of 1,2-disubstituted Z alkenes are scarce. This paper describes catalytic Z-selective cross-metathesis reactions of terminal enol ethers, which have not been reported previously,and allylic amides, used thus far only in E-selective processes. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by its use in syntheses of anti oxidant C18 (plasm)-16:0 (PC), found in electrically active tissues and implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and the potent immunostimulant KRN7000."
https://openalex.org/W2111444437,"Little is known of the intracellular machinery that controls the motility of newborn neurons. We have previously shown that the proneural protein Neurog2 promotes the migration of nascent cortical neurons by inducing the expression of the atypical Rho GTPase Rnd2. Here, we show that another proneural factor, Ascl1, promotes neuronal migration in the cortex through direct regulation of a second Rnd family member, Rnd3. Both Rnd2 and Rnd3 promote neuronal migration by inhibiting RhoA signaling, but they control distinct steps of the migratory process, multipolar to bipolar transition in the intermediate zone and locomotion in the cortical plate, respectively. Interestingly, these divergent functions directly result from the distinct subcellular distributions of the two Rnd proteins. Because Rnd proteins also regulate progenitor divisions and neurite outgrowth, we propose that proneural factors, through spatiotemporal regulation of Rnd proteins, integrate the process of neuronal migration with other events in the neurogenic program."
https://openalex.org/W2122138985,"Quantum metrology studies the use of entanglement and other quantum resources to improve precision measurement. An interferometer using N independent particles to measure a parameter X can achieve at best the ""standard quantum limit"" (SQL) of sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-1/2}. The same interferometer using N entangled particles can achieve in principle the ""Heisenberg limit"" {\delta}X \propto N^{-1}, using exotic states. Recent theoretical work argues that interactions among particles may be a valuable resource for quantum metrology, allowing scaling beyond the Heisenberg limit. Specifically, a k-particle interaction will produce sensitivity {\delta}X \propto N^{-k} with appropriate entangled states and {\delta}X \propto N^{-(k-1/2)} even without entanglement. Here we demonstrate this ""super-Heisenberg"" scaling in a nonlinear, non-destructive measurement of the magnetisation of an atomic ensemble. We use fast optical nonlinearities to generate a pairwise photon-photon interaction (k = 2) while preserving quantum-noise-limited performance, to produce {\delta}X \propto N^{-3/2}. We observe super-Heisenberg scaling over two orders of magnitude in N, limited at large N by higher-order nonlinear effects, in good agreement with theory. For a measurement of limited duration, super-Heisenberg scaling allows the nonlinear measurement to overtake in sensitivity a comparable linear measurement with the same number of photons. In other scenarios, however, higher-order nonlinearities prevent this crossover from occurring, reflecting the subtle relationship of scaling to sensitivity in nonlinear systems. This work shows that inter-particle interactions can improve sensitivity in a quantum-limited measurement, and introduces a fundamentally new resource for quantum metrology."
https://openalex.org/W2049120523,"Individuals exposed to high-fat, high-sugar diets before birth have an increased risk of obesity in later life. Recent studies have shown that these offspring exhibit increased preference for fat, leading to suggestions that perinatal exposure to high-fat, high-sugar foods results in permanent changes within the central reward system that increase the subsequent drive to overconsume palatable foods. The present study has determined the effect of a maternal ""junk-food"" diet on the expression of key components of the mesolimbic reward pathway in the offspring of rat dams at 6 wk and 3 mo of age. We show that offspring of junk-food-fed (JF) dams exhibit higher fat intake from weaning until at least 3 mo of age (males: 16 ± 0.6 vs. 11 ± 0.8 g/kg/d; females: 19 ± 1.3 vs. 13 ± 0.4 g/kg/d; P<0.01). mRNA expression of μ-opioid receptor (Mu) was 1.6-fold higher (P<0.01) and dopamine active transporter (DAT) was 2-fold lower (P<0.05) in JF offspring at 6 wk of age. By 3 mo, these differences were reversed, and Mu mRNA expression was 2.8-fold lower (P<0.01) and DAT mRNA expression was 1.9-fold higher (P<0.01) in the JF offspring. These findings suggest that perinatal exposure to high-fat, high-sugar diets results in altered development of the central reward system, resulting in increased fat intake and altered response of the reward system to excessive junk-food intake in postnatal life."
https://openalex.org/W1971371925,"Learning is correlated with the assembly of new synapses, but the roles of synaptogenesis processes in memory are poorly understood. Here, we show that mice lacking β-Adducin fail to assemble new synapses upon enhanced plasticity and exhibit diminished long-term hippocampal memory upon environmental enrichment. Enrichment-enhanced the disassembly and assembly of dynamic subpopulations of synapses. Upon enrichment, stable assembly of new synapses depended on the presence of β-Adducin, disassembly involved β-Adducin phosphorylation through PKC, and both were required for augmented learning. In the absence of β-Adducin, enrichment still led to an increase in spine structures, but the assembly of synapses at those spines was compromised. Virus-mediated re-expression of β-Adducin in hippocampal granule cells of β-Adducin−/− mice rescued new synapse assembly and learning upon enrichment.

Environmental enrichment protocols, where animals experience more sensory, motor, and social stimuli, provide attractive experimental systems to investigate causal relationships between learning and synaptogenesis processes in the adult (van Praag et al., 2000van Praag H.

Thus, enrichment produces robust and reversible increases in the numbers of excitatory synapses in the CNS, as well as circuit alterations reminiscent of enhanced plasticity in juveniles (Moser et al., 1997Moser M.B.

In parallel, when mice with targeted mutations that compromise synaptic plasticity and learning are housed in enriched environment, learning deficits due to the mutant background can be overcome (Rampon et al., 2000Rampon C. Tang Y.P. Goodhouse J. Shimizu E. Kyin M. Tsien J.Z. Enrichment induces structural changes and recovery from nonspatial memory deficits in CA1 NMDAR1-knockout mice.Nat.

Enriched environments, experience-dependent plasticity and disorders of the nervous system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enrichment promotes access to critical period-like plasticity and enhances recovery after lesions in the adult (Kim et al., 2008Kim B.G. Dai H.N. McAtee M. Bregman B.S.

The powerful behavioral consequences of environmental enrichment may thus involve enhanced synapse turnover and synaptogenesis, but testing this hypothesis has been prevented by the absence of tools to specifically interfere with synaptogenesis processes in the adult. Here, we introduce a mouse model with a specific deficit in the assembly of synapses under conditions of enhanced plasticity in the adult and exploit the model to investigate a role for enhanced synaptogenesis in supporting learning and memory upon environmental enrichment. While under basal conditions, only a minority of synapses turn over in the adult CNS, physiological signals that promote plasticity not only increase synaptogenesis, but also enhance synapse turnover. For example, (1) the potent enhancer of plasticity BDNF promotes synaptogenesis and spine turnover (Horch et al., 1999Horch H.W. Krüttgen A. Portbury S.D. Katz L.C.

USA. 2008; 105: 9391-9396Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar); (3) oculodominance shift experiments in adult mice have provided evidence for enhanced synapse turnover paired to long-term retention of functionally important synapses in visual cortex (Hofer et al., 2009Hofer S.B. Mrsic-Flogel T.D. Bonhoeffer T. Hübener M. Experience leaves a lasting structural trace in cortical circuits.Nature. 2009; 457: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar); (4) enhanced plasticity during circuit maturation is accompanied by both higher synapse densities and higher turnover rates of synapses (Gan et al., 2003Gan W.B.

Neurosci. 2003; 6: 956-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies in different systems and under different experimental circumstances all suggest that learning-related plasticity may involve enhanced synapse turnover coupled to the establishment and retention of critical synapses. Investigating causal relationships among synapse turnover, synapse formation, and learning would be greatly helped by the availability of animal models in which the formation and/or maintenance of new synapses in the adult is impaired. Given that the vast majority of excitatory synapses appear to be stable in the adult, failure to stabilize new synapses may selectively affect a minority of synapses, possibly including the additional synapses upon environmental enrichment. β-Adducin, an abundant and broadly expressed member of the Adducin family of cortical cytoskeleton-stabilizing proteins in neurons, has properties of a candidate gene to regulate synapse stability upon plasticity (Matsuoka et al., 2000Matsuoka Y.

Unlike α- and γ-Adducin, which are expressed ubiquitously, β-Adducin is mainly expressed in the nervous system and in erythrocytes. Adducins function as homo- and heterodimers that cap actin filaments in the cytosol and link them to the spectrin cytoskeleton at the cell membrane (Matsuoka et al., 2000Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. Adducin: Structure, function and regulation.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 884-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Negative regulation of Adducin binding to the actin cytoskeleton involves phosphorylation by PKC and PKA and binding of calcium-calmodulin (Matsuoka et al., 1998Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. Adducin is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase C: Phosphorylation in the MARCKS-related domain inhibits activity in promoting spectrin-actin complexes and occurs in many cells, including dendritic spines of neurons.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of β-Adducin is strongly enhanced upon LTP induction, suggesting that it may be involved in regulating plasticity (Gruenbaum et al., 2003Gruenbaum L.M. Gilligan D.M. Picciotto M.R. Marinesco S. Carew T.J. Identification and characterization of Aplysia adducin, an Aplysia cytoskeletal protein homologous to mammalian adducins: Increased phosphorylation at a protein kinase C consensus site during long-term synaptic facilitation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2675-2685PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, mice lacking β-Adducin exhibit a deficit in the long-term maintenance of LTP and specific deficits in hippocampal learning (Rabenstein et al., 2005Rabenstein R.L. Addy N.A. Caldarone B.J. Asaka Y. Gruenbaum L.M. Peters L.L. Gilligan D.M. Fitzsimonds R.M. Picciotto M.R. Impaired synaptic plasticity and learning in mice lacking beta-adducin, an actin-regulating protein.J.

The mechanisms underlying the plasticity and learning deficits in β-Adducin−/− mice are currently unclear, but one possibility consistent with its role as a linker between cortical and actin cytoskeleton is that β-Adducin may have a critical role to promote stabilization of new synapses upon learning. Consistent with this possibility, β-Adducin accumulates at dendritic spines (Matsuoka et al., 1998Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. Adducin is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase C: Phosphorylation in the MARCKS-related domain inhibits activity in promoting spectrin-actin complexes and occurs in many cells, including dendritic spines of neurons.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and its Drosophila homolog has a critical role to stabilize larval neuromuscular junctions (Pielage et al., 2011Pielage P. Bulat V. Zuchero J.B. Fetter R.D. Davis G.W. Hts/Adducin controls synaptic elaboration and elimination.Neuron. 2011; 69 (this issue): 1114-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated synapse remodeling and learning upon environmental enrichment in the presence and absence of β-Adducin. We focused our analysis on large mossy fiber terminals (LMTs) in the stratum lucidum of hippocampal CA3 and on dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal CA1. LMTs are potent presynaptic terminals consisting of up to more than 30 individual synapses with pyramidal neuron thorny excrescences (Henze et al., 2000Henze D.A. Urban N.N. Barrionuevo G. The multifarious hippocampal mossy fiber pathway: A review.Neuroscience. 2000; 98: 407-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the context of this study, their experimental advantages include the fact that synapse numbers at individual LMTs can be selectively regulated upon environmental enrichment (Gogolla et al., 2009Gogolla N. Galimberti I. Deguchi Y. Caroni P. Wnt signaling mediates experience-related regulation of synapse numbers and mossy fiber connectivities in the adult hippocampus.Neuron. 2009; 62: 510-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), that the neurons that originate the mossy fibers (granule cells) are readily accessible to targeted experimental manipulations in the dentate gyrus, and that the functional output of the granule cells in CA3 can be assayed behaviorally (Jessberger et al., 2009Jessberger S. Clark R.E. Broadbent N.J. Clemenson Jr., G.D. Consiglio A. Lie D.C. Squire L.R. Gage F.H. Dentate gyrus-specific knockdown of adult neurogenesis impairs spatial and object recognition memory in adult rats.Learn. Mem. 2009; 16: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). We show that at LMTs of mice housed under control conditions about 35% of the synapses are relatively labile and become reversibly destabilized in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. Environmental enrichment greatly accelerated the disassembly and assembly of labile synapses at LMTs, which became dependent on the presence of nonphosphorylated β-Adducin for their maintenance. In enriched mice lacking β-Adducin, labile synapses were destabilized and reassembly was specifically impaired. This involved cell-autonomous roles of β-Adducin, and led to a failure to assemble new synapses upon enriched environment in the absence of β-Adducin at LMTs and in CA1. Interestingly, enrichment still produced a robust increase in postsynaptic spine structures at LMTs and in CA1 in the absence of β-Adducin, but this was not matched by a corresponding increase in synaptic structures at these spines. Most notably, while enrichment-enhanced hippocampal learning and memory in wild-type mice, it impaired learning and memory in β-Adducin−/− mice, and these deficits were specifically rescued by reintroducing β-Adducin into granule cells. These results establish β-Adducin−/− mice as a model system to investigate roles of synaptogenesis processes in learning, memory, and repair in the adult. The results further provide evidence that synapse disassembly and the stable assembly of new synapses are both critically important to mediate the beneficial effects of environmental enrichment on learning and memory. Does housing mice under enriched environment conditions influence synapse stabilities? To address this question, we studied the losses and recoveries of putative active zones (AZ) at LMTs in vivo upon a single local unilateral application of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin to hippocampal dentate gyrus, where the cell bodies of mossy fibers are located. The treatment interrupts the supply of newly synthesized proteins during 6–8 hr postinjection (peak at 3 hr; no detectable inhibition at 9 hr), leading to a transient destabilization of synaptic complexes (Wanisch and Wotjak, 2008Wanisch K. Wotjak C.T. Time course and efficiency of protein synthesis inhibition following intracerebral and systemic anisomycin treatment.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2008; 90: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Dieterich et al., 2010Dieterich D.C. Hodas J.J. Gouzer G. Shadrin I.Y. Ngo J.T. Triller A. Tirrell D.A. Schuman E.M. In situ visualization and dynamics of newly synthesized proteins in rat hippocampal neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar; Figure 1A ). We monitored AZ densities as contents of Bassoon-positive puncta per mossy fiber LMT volume in CA3b. Since this is about 1 mm away from the cell bodies of granule cells, local delivery of previously synthesized proteins upon anisomycin continued for a period of 4 hr (6 mm/day axonal transport rates) to 12 hr (2 mm/day rates; slowest components of axonal transport) (Figure 1A). In control experiments, we obtained closely comparable results when analyzing Synapsin1-positive puncta as a second AZ marker (see Figure S1 available online). For most experiments, LMTs were visualized in transgenic Thy1-mGFPLsi1 reporter mice (De Paola et al., 2003De Paola V. Arber S. Caroni P. AMPA receptors regulate dynamic equilibrium of presynaptic terminals in mature hippocampal networks.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but all main results were confirmed in neurons that were randomly labeled with an mGFP lentivirus (Experimental Procedures). In mice housed under standard cage conditions (defined here as control), anisomycin had no detectable effect on AZ densities for up to 6 hr and led to a transient decrease at 12 hr and 24 hr, followed by recovery to control values at 48 hr (Figure 1B). By contrast, mice that had been housed in enriched environment for 2 weeks exhibited dramatically accelerated AZ losses and recoveries: AZ densities were already substantially reduced at 6 hr, minimum values were reached at 12 hr, and AZ densities had fully recovered at 24 hr (Figure 1B). The accelerated AZ losses were reflected in reduced stratum lucidum Bassoon protein contents at 6 hr of anisomycin, suggesting that AZ disassembly and Bassoon degradation were correlated (Figure S1). Upon 4 weeks of enrichment, AZ densities in the absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor were substantially higher than under control conditions (Figure 1B; p < 0.001), but the time courses of AZ losses and recoveries upon anisomycin were comparable to those of mice that had been exposed to enrichment for 2 weeks (Figure 1B). Notably, minimum AZ densities upon anisomycin were comparable under all experimental conditions. Since under control conditions LMT densities in stratum lucidum were not affected by anisomycin (not shown), these results suggest that a comparable number of AZs per LMT volume (ca. 1.4 per μm3) is resistant to disassembly induced by anisomycin under control conditions and upon 2 or 4 weeks of enrichment (Figure 1B). In parallel to an enhanced AZ turnover, environmental enrichment produced net structural alterations in LMTs. We defined LMT complexities as the convolution degree of LMTs and expressed them as ratios between measured volumes and predicted volumes for spheres of equal surface area. As shown in a previous study, enhanced convolution degrees upon enrichment reflect the presence of more elaborate postsynaptic thorny excrescences and of higher numbers of synaptic contacts at LMTs (Gogolla et al., 2009Gogolla N. Galimberti I. Deguchi Y. Caroni P. Wnt signaling mediates experience-related regulation of synapse numbers and mossy fiber connectivities in the adult hippocampus.Neuron. 2009; 62: 510-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We now found that LMT complexity distributions were already detectably different from controls at 2 weeks of enriched environment, when the populations of more simple and more complex LMTs were both enhanced (Figures 1C and 1D), whereas no detectable changes in LMT complexities were detected after 1 week of enrichment (not shown). Upon 4 weeks of enrichment, contents of simple LMTs had reversed to control values, whereas the fraction of very complex LMTs had increased further (Figure 1D). Consistent with the notion that enhanced complexities and accelerated AZ turnovers may be related phenomena, LMTs with higher complexities exhibited markedly lower AZ/LMT volume values upon anisomycin than those with lower complexities (Figure 1E). Therefore, housing mice in enriched environment results in an acceleration of AZ disassembly and assembly upon anisomycin and LMT remodeling, which are clearly detectable from 2 weeks on, whereas net increases in synapse numbers only become detectable at later time points (Figure 1F). Does the accelerated AZ turnover upon anisomycin and/or the larger total numbers of synapses have a role in the enhanced plasticity and the more robust learning produced by environmental enrichment conditions? As a first step to address these questions, we searched for mice that may have a defect in synapse stabilization, reasoning that these may then provide a sensitized background to uncover any functional roles of enhanced synapse dynamics and/or synapse numbers upon enrichment. Accordingly, we analyzed synapse turnover in mature hippocampal slice cultures from β-Adducin−/− mice. Most imaging was carried out with 30 days cultures (corresponding to about P35), and experiments with 60 days cultures yielded comparable results (not shown). Time-lapse imaging of wild-type LMTs at 1 day intervals revealed the expected relative stability, with only occasional gains or losses in filopodia and hardly any turnover of satellite LMTs (Figures 2A and 2B ). By contrast, β-Adducin−/− LMTs exhibited dramatic remodeling of filopodia and satellites (Figures 2A and 2B), suggesting enhanced synapse turnover in the absence of β-Adducin. To determine whether the enhanced structural plasticity of LMTs was a direct consequence of the absence of β-Adducin, and whether it was cell autonomous, we reintroduced a functional GFP-β-Adducin construct (Matsuoka et al., 1998Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. Adducin is an in vivo substrate for protein kinase C: Phosphorylation in the MARCKS-related domain inhibits activity in promoting spectrin-actin complexes and occurs in many cells, including dendritic spines of neurons.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) into granule cells in the slice cultures via gene gun. GFP-β-Adducin accumulated efficiently in dendritic and axonal compartments of transduced granule cells, including LMTs (Figure 2B). In parallel, reintroduction of GFP-β-Adducin into granule cells restored the stability of satellites and filopodia at LMTs of transduced neurons (Figure 2B). To further investigate the stability of synaptic membrane structures in the absence of β-Adducin, we monitored spine turnover in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal CA1 in mature wild-type and β-Adducin−/− slice cultures. In the absence of β-Adducin, spine gains and losses were more than twice as frequent as in wild-type cultures (Figures 2C and 2D). Consistent with the notion that the presence of β-Adducin is important to stabilize spines, mutant dendrites exhibited a low frequency of thin (i.e., relatively unstable) spines (Figure 2C). To determine whether the enhanced spine turnover was a direct consequence of the absence of β-Adducin in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites, we reintroduced the protein into CA1. The GFP-β-Adducin construct distributed efficiently into pyramidal neuron dendrites, where it accumulated at dendritic spines (Figure 2D). In parallel, the construct completely restored spine stability (Figure 2D). Taken together, these results provide evidence that β-Adducin is critically important to stabilize synaptic structures in mature slice cultures, which exhibit enhanced turnover in its absence. The results further show that β-Adducin acts acutely and cell autonomously pre- and postsynaptically to stabilize synaptic structures. Do AZs exhibit enhanced lability in the absence of β-Adducin in vivo? In the absence of anisomycin, AZ densities at LMTs of β-Adducin−/− mice were undistinguishable from those in wild-type mice (Figures 3A and 3B ). However, application of anisomycin into the dentate gyrus of β-Adducin−/− mice led to a rapid loss of about 40% of the AZs at 6 hr (Figure 3A). Peak reductions at 12 hr were about 50% of untreated control, and values at 24 hr were within a comparable range (Figure 3A). At 48 hr, AZ densities had recovered to about 90% of control values (Figure 3A). These findings suggest that the stability of about half of the synaptic complexes at LMTs is severely impaired in the absence of β-Adducin. By contrast, and unlike those of wild-type mice upon enrichment, recoveries from anisomycin-induced losses were not accelerated in the mutant mice, suggesting that the absence of β-Adducin specifically enhanced AZ lability without enhancing reassembly. Like in the enrichment experiments in wild-type mice, AZ density values did not decline substantially beyond 6 hr, suggesting that LMT AZs may consist of subpopulations with distinct labilities and that about half of the AZs resist anisomycin-induced disassembly even in the absence of β-Adducin. In spite of the evidence for enhanced AZ lability in the anisomycin experiments, we found no evidence for alterations in synapse densities in adult β-Adducin−/− mice. At the ultrastructural level, AZ densities per postsynaptic thorn area at LMTs were comparable in wild-type and β-Adducin−/− mice, and satellite numbers per LMT were also not detectably different from control values (Figure 3B). Likewise, spine densities and densities of PSD95-positive postsynaptic densities at spines (Figure 3C), as well as densities of PSD95 puncta in CA1 (see Figure 6B) did not detectably differ from control values in β-Adducin−/− mice. A comparison of spine morphologies suggested a lower incidence of thin spines and an unusually high frequency of long spines with very large heads in β-Adducin−/− mice, possibly reflecting a higher resistance to destabilization in these larger spines (Figure 3C). Taken together, AZs exhibit enhanced anisomycin-induced lability in the absence of β-Adducin in vivo, but when mice are housed under control conditions, this enhanced lability is not reflected in noticeable changes in the densities of excitatory synapses in hippocampal stratum lucidum or in CA1. Phosphorylation of β-Adducin leads to its dissociation from plasma membrane anchorage sites, raising the possibility that phosphorylation of β-Adducin may be involved in synapse disassembly under conditions of enhanced plasticity. To explore the possibility that β-Adducin may be a direct target of regulation to decrease synapse stability upon environmental enrichment, we monitored the levels of phospho-β-Adducin in stratum lucidum with a specific"
https://openalex.org/W1975784041,"Neuropathic pain resulting from nerve lesions or dysfunction represents one of the most challenging neurological diseases to treat. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for causing these maladaptive responses can help develop novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for neuropathic pain. We performed a miRNA expression profiling study of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissue from rats four weeks post spinal nerve ligation (SNL), a model of neuropathic pain. TaqMan low density arrays identified 63 miRNAs whose level of expression was significantly altered following SNL surgery. Of these, 59 were downregulated and the ipsilateral L4 DRG, not the injured L5 DRG, showed the most significant downregulation suggesting that miRNA changes in the uninjured afferents may underlie the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. TargetScan was used to predict mRNA targets for these miRNAs and it was found that the transcripts with multiple predicted target sites belong to neurologically important pathways. By employing different bioinformatic approaches we identified neurite remodeling as a significantly regulated biological pathway, and some of these predictions were confirmed by siRNA knockdown for genes that regulate neurite growth in differentiated Neuro2A cells. In vitro validation for predicted target sites in the 3′-UTR of voltage-gated sodium channel Scn11a, alpha 2/delta1 subunit of voltage-dependent Ca-channel, and purinergic receptor P2rx ligand-gated ion channel 4 using luciferase reporter assays showed that identified miRNAs modulated gene expression significantly. Our results suggest the potential for miRNAs to play a direct role in neuropathic pain."

C. elegans relies on diffusion for gas exchange and avoids environments with elevated CO2. We show that C. elegans temperature, O2, and salt-sensing neurons are also CO2 sensors mediating CO2 avoidance. AFD thermosensors respond to increasing CO2 by a fall and then rise in Ca2+ and show a Ca2+ spike when CO2 decreases. BAG O2 sensors and ASE salt sensors are both activated by CO2 and remain tonically active while high CO2 persists. CO2-evoked Ca2+ responses in AFD and BAG neurons require cGMP-gated ion channels. Atypical soluble guanylate cyclases mediating O2 responses also contribute to BAG CO2 responses. AFD and BAG neurons together stimulate turning when CO2 rises and inhibit turning when CO2 falls. Our results show that C. elegans senses CO2 using functionally diverse sensory neurons acting homeostatically to minimize exposure to elevated CO2."

Which neurotransmitter (or neurotransmitters) a synapse releases is determined by expression of the vesicular neurotransmitter transporters.

VGLUT1 is present in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar cortex and has a late onset of expression, but VGLUT2 is expressed in early development and at its highest levels in the thalamus and lower brainstem regions of adult rodents (Herzog et al., 2001Herzog E.

VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are the most abundant isoforms and account for most neurons previously thought to release glutamate. VGLUT3 is found in hair cells of the auditory pathway, where it is essential for glutamate release (Gillespie et al., 2005Gillespie D.C. Kim G. Kandler K.

It is also present in neurons that release other neurotransmitters such as GABA, acetylcholine, and serotonin, where it serves to enhance the filling of serotonin and acetylcholine (Amilhon et al., 2010Amilhon B.

Localization of VGLUT3, the vesicular glutamate transporter type 3, in the rat brain.Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific expression patterns of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGLUT3 suggest that each isoform may play a specialized role in glutamate release. We therefore decided to test the hypothesis that the three VGLUT isoforms confer specific properties of glutamatergic neurotransmission upon the synapses at which they are present. We used whole-cell voltage clamp to record synaptic currents from primary cultured neurons expressing different endogenous or virally expressed VGLUT isoforms and measured basic parameters of synaptic function. Our results demonstrate that expression of any VGLUT, including VGLUT3, gives a neuron the ability to release glutamate and that neurons expressing VGLUT1 exhibit lower vesicular release probability (Pvr) and altered short-term plasticity compared to VGLUT2- or VGLUT3-expressing neurons. In exploring the mechanism by which VGLUT isoforms regulate exocytosis, we identified endophilin A1 as a positive regulator of release efficiency and propose that VGLUT1's effects result from binding and inhibiting endophilin A1. We wanted to directly compare the basic functions of VGLUT1, VGLUT2 and VGLUT3 in an otherwise identical cellular environment. Previous studies demonstrated that hippocampal VGLUT1−/− neurons and thalamic VGLUT2−/− neurons have very low or undetectable levels of VGLUT protein, virtually no evoked or spontaneous glutamate release, and a very small readily releasable pool (RRP) of filled synaptic vesicles (Fremeau et al., 2004Fremeau Jr., R.T.

USA. 2004; 101: 7158-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We prepared primary autaptic cultures of these neurons and used lentiviruses to induce expression of each of the three VGLUT isoforms. We then performed whole-cell voltage-clamp analysis to test for rescue of the synaptic response. Evoked responses were measured in knockout neurons and neurons infected with VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and VGLUT3-expressing lentiviruses. Expression of all three isoforms rescued the deficit in EPSC peak amplitude and EPSC charge in both VGLUT1−/− hippocampal neurons (Figures 1A and 1D ) and VGLUT2−/− thalamic neurons (Figures 1B and 1E). The EPSC amplitudes of neurons rescued with VGLUT1, VGLUT2 and VGLUT3 were not significantly different from hippocampal VGLUT+/+ neurons infected with a lentivirus expressing only GFP, nor were they significantly different from each other (Figures 1D and 1E). The charge contained in the EPSC of VGLUT1, VGLUT2 and VGLUT3 expressing hippocampal neurons were slightly larger, but not significantly different from, control neurons, and were not significantly different from each other (Figure 1F, left panel). We also measured the size of the charge contained in the RRP by applying 500 mM sucrose (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Again all three VGLUT isoforms rescued the severe deficit seen in both VGLUT1−/− hippocampal neurons (Figures 1C and 1F) and VGLUT2−/− thalamic neurons (data not shown) to levels not significantly different from VGLUT+/+ thalamic neurons, suggesting that the three isoforms perform the basic function of filling synaptic vesicles with glutamate in a similar manner. Because VGLUT3 is expressed mainly in neurons thought to release other classical neurotransmitters, we decided to test whether expression of VGLUT3 in nonglutamatergic cells was sufficient for synaptic glutamate release. We prepared primary cultures of GABAergic striatal neurons and infected them with the VGLUT3-expressing lentivirus. We measured synaptic responses with high Cl--containing internal solution and isolated the glutamatergic component of the synaptic response with bicuculline (30 μM) and/or kynurenic acid (3 mM). As previously shown for VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (Takamori et al., 2000Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Identification of a vesicular glutamate transporter that defines a glutamatergic phenotype in neurons.Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, Takamori et al., 2001Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Identification of differentiation-associated brain-specific phosphate transporter as a second vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT2).J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC182PubMed Google Scholar), VGLUT3 expressed in GABAergic striatal neurons was sufficient to induce glutamate release in these cells that normally release only GABA (Figure 1G). After 14 days in vitro, glutamatergic EPSC were recorded in 21 of 28 infected neurons, while no glutamatergic EPSCs were recorded from uninfected control GABAergic neurons (n = 15). In addition to the analysis of evoked release, we tested whether spontaneous release of glutamate could be detected in these neurons. Blocking GABA receptors with bicuculline (30 μM) in infected neurons revealed mEPSCs that were blocked by kynurenic acid (3 mM, Figure 1H) and had peak amplitudes that were similar to glutamatergic neurons (Figure 1I; Moechars et al., 2006Moechars D. Weston M.C. Leo S. Callaerts-Vegh Z. Goris I. Daneels G. Buist A. Cik M. van der Spek P. Kass S. et al.Vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 expression levels control quantal size and neuropathic pain.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12055-12066Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), suggesting that the transport and accumulation of glutamate by VGLUT3 in synaptic vesicles of neurons that release neurotransmitters other than glutamate is similar to transport in native glutamatergic neurons, and that VGLUT3 expression is sufficient for a glutamatergic phenotype in central neurons. Because neurons that express VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in vivo show a correlation between the isoform expressed and probability of glutamate release (Fremeau et al., 2001Fremeau Jr., R.T. Troyer M.D. Pahner I. Nygaard G.O. Tran C.H. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Fortin D. Storm-Mathisen J. Edwards R.H.

Presynaptic control of quantal size: Kinetic mechanisms and implications for synaptic transmission and plasticity.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we performed an analysis of Pvr and short-term plasticity in order to determine whether neurons with different VGLUT isoforms release glutamate in quantitatively distinct manners. We first examined cell types in which VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are differentially expressed in vivo. For VGLUT1 expressing cells we chose hippocampal neurons, in which 85%–90% of the excitatory synaptic current depends on VGLUT1 (Fremeau et al., 2004Fremeau Jr., R.T. Kam K. Qureshi T. Johnson J. Copenhagen D.R. Storm-Mathisen J. Chaudhry F.A. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7158-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For VGLUT2 we chose thalamic neurons, in which 90% of the excitatory synaptic response depends on VGLUT2 (Moechars et al., 2006Moechars D. Weston M.C. Leo S. Callaerts-Vegh Z. Goris I. Daneels G. Buist A. Cik M. van der Spek P. Kass S. et al.Vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2 expression levels control quantal size and neuropathic pain.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12055-12066Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We calculated the Pvr by comparing the charge contained in the RRP with the charge of the EPSC. Thalamic neurons had a significantly higher Pvr than hippocampal neurons and showed strong paired-pulse depression characteristic of high-release probability synapses. In contrast, hippocampal neurons showed moderate paired-pulse facilitation and lower Pvr (Figures 2A and 2B ). In addition, application of high-frequency stimulation (10 Hz) caused EPSCs of thalamic neurons to depress to only 20% of their prestimulus values after 5 s, while hippocampal neurons were able to maintain EPSC amplitudes averaging approximately 60% of prestimulus values (data not shown). The analysis of wild-type hippocampal and thalamic neurons demonstrates that VGLUT isoform expression correlates with properties of glutamate release. It does not, however, demonstrate a causal relationship, because numerous other differences between hippocampal and thalamic neurons may influence their Pvr and short-term plasticity. We therefore returned to the knockout-rescue approach to allow a direct comparison of the VGLUTs in an identical cellular environment. Analysis of Pvr revealed that hippocampal VGLUT1−/− neurons rescued with VGLUT1 had a Pvr identical to hippocampal VGLUT1+/+ neurons. However, when either VGLUT2 or VGLUT3 was expressed in the VGLUT1−/− hippocampal neurons, release probabilities increased 30%–35% relative to both VGLUT1+/+ and VGLUT1 rescue neurons (Figure 2D). In addition, rescue with the endogenous isoform VGLUT1 produced neurons with paired-pulse facilitation, while VGLUT2-expressing neurons showed paired-pulse depression (Figures 2C and 2F, VGLUT3 not tested). Consistent with this finding, the response to high-frequency stimulation of VGLUT1−/− neurons expressing VGLUT1 was indistinguishable from VGLUT1+/+ neurons, while VGLUT2 and VGLUT3-expressing neurons showed significantly more depression (Figure 2E), indicating higher release probability in the latter two groups. In order to test whether the effect of VGLUT expression on Pvr was specific to hippocampal cells, we repeated the analysis by expressing VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in thalamic VGLUT2−/− neurons. In thalamic VGLUT2−/− cells, rescue with VGLUT2 produced neurons with Pvr that were indistinguishable from thalamic VGLUT2+/+ neurons, while neurons rescued with VGLUT1 showed a significant 25% reduction (Figure 2H). Paired-pulse ratios were also significantly different between VGLUT1- and VGLUT2-expressing cells (Figure 2G). Depression in response to 10 Hz stimulation was slightly greater in VGLUT2-expressing neurons than VGLUT1-expressing neurons, but not significantly different, as both types still displayed the near complete depletion characteristic of thalamic cells (data not shown). It is important to note that although expression of VGLUT2 in hippocampal neurons was sufficient to induce a thalamic-like phenotype, while expression of VGLUT1 in thalamic neurons induced a hippocampal-like phenotype, the effects were not strong enough to completely account for the differences between the wild-type hippocampal and thalamic neurons. We also note that the changes in Pvr were not accompanied by significant differences in either of the component parameters, EPSC charge or RRP size. Both EPSC charge and RRP size are, however, heavily dependent on the number of synapses formed by the neurons, which can vary by neuron, culture, and age of culture, while Pvr is not affected by synapse number. Having established that VGLUT1-expressing neurons release glutamate with a lower probability than VGLUT2- and VGLUT3-expressing neurons, we wanted to investigate possible mechanisms. Because VGLUT isoforms may differ in their trafficking (Fremeau et al., 2001Fremeau Jr., R.T. Troyer M.D. Pahner I. Nygaard G.O. Tran C.H. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Fortin D. Storm-Mathisen J. Edwards R.H. The expression of vesicular glutamate transporters defines two classes of excitatory synapse.Neuron. 2001; 31: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) and variable levels of VGLUT protein at the synapse may affect Pvr and short-term plasticity, we first performed a quantitative analysis of immunofluorescent images to compare expression levels of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 at the synapse (Figure S1, available online). After electrophysiology experiments were completed we immunostained the remaining neurons for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and synaptophysin (Figure S1A). We then compared the ratio of VGLUT fluorescence intensity to the vesicular protein synaptophysin fluorescence intensity at identified synapses (De Gois et al., 2005De Gois S. Schäfer M.K. Defamie N. Chen C. Ricci A. Weihe E. Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. Homeostatic scaling of vesicular glutamate and GABA transporter expression in rat neocortical circuits.J.

Both VGLUT1−/− and VGLUT1+/− neurons showed a significant reduction in VGLUT/synaptophysin fluorescence ratio compared to VGLUT1+/+, while overexpression of VGLUT1 showed a significant increase (Figure S1B). VGLUT/synaptophysin fluorescence ratios in VGLUT1−/− neurons infected with VGLUT1, however, were not different from VGLUT1+/+ neurons (Figure S1B). To compare expression levels of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 proteins we inserted a myc tag into the first luminal loop of each transporter to circumvent the complications of different primary antibody affinities. These constructs were first tested with electrophysiology in neurons to confirm they retained the phenotypes of the untagged VGLUTs (data not shown). The cultures were then fixed and immunostained with anti-myc and anti-synaptophysin antibodies. The myc/synaptophysin intensity ratios in VGLUT−/− neurons expressing either VGLUT1-myc or VGLUT2-myc were not different from each other (Figure S1C), demonstrating that the differences in Pvr and paired-pulse ratios in these neurons were not due to different expression levels at the synapse. Next, we considered that the VGLUT isoforms might induce different filling states of synaptic vesicles, which may alter the probability of glutamate release (Moechars et al., 2006Moechars D.

Here, we provide evidence Hts/Adducin can serve this function. We show that Drosophila Hts/Adducin is enriched both pre- and postsynaptically at the NMJ. We then demonstrate that presynaptic Hts/Adducin is necessary and sufficient to control two opposing processes associated with synapse remodeling: (1) synapse stabilization as determined by light level and ultrastructural and electrophysiological assays and (2) the elaboration of actin-based, filopodia-like protrusions that drive synaptogenesis and growth. Synapse remodeling is sensitive to Hts/Adducin levels, and we provide evidence that the synaptic localization of Hts/Adducin is controlled via phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Drosophila Hts/Adducin protein has actin-capping activity. We propose that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Hts/Adducin controls the level, localization, and activity of Hts/Adducin, influencing actin-based synapse elaboration and spectrin-based synapse stabilization. Hts/Adducin may define a mechanism to switch between synapse stability and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2008452682,"Background Histamine is the prototypical pruritogen used in experimental itch induction. However, in most chronic pruritic diseases, itch is not predominantly mediated by histamine. Cowhage-induced itch, on the other hand, seems more characteristic of itch occurring in chronic pruritic diseases. Objectives We tested the validity of cowhage as an itch-inducing agent by contrasting it with the classical itch inducer, histamine, in healthy subjects and atopic dermatitis (AD) patients. We also investigated whether there was a cumulative effect when both agents were combined. Methods Fifteen healthy individuals and fifteen AD patients were recruited. Experimental itch induction was performed in eczema-free areas on the volar aspects of the forearm, using different itch inducers: histamine, cowhage and their combination thereof. Itch intensity was assessed continuously for 5.5 minutes after stimulus application using a computer-assisted visual analogue scale (COVAS). Results In both healthy and AD subjects, the mean and peak intensity of itch were higher after the application of cowhage compared to histamine, and were higher after the combined application of cowhage and histamine, compared to histamine alone (p<0.0001 in all cases). Itch intensity ratings were not significantly different between healthy and AD subjects for the same itch inducer used; however AD subjects exhibited a prolonged itch response in comparison to healthy subjects ( p<0.001). Conclusions Cowhage induced a more intense itch sensation compared to histamine. Cowhage was the dominant factor in itch perception when both pathways were stimulated in the same time. Cowhage-induced itch is a suitable model for the study of itch in AD and other chronic pruritic diseases, and it can serve as a new model for testing antipruritic drugs in humans."

Transmembrane proton gradients drive ATP synthesis, metabolite transport, receptor recycling and vesicle trafficking, while compartmental pH controls enzyme function. Despite this fundamental importance, the mechanisms underlying pH homeostasis are not entirely accounted for in any organelle or organism. We undertook a genome-wide survey of vacuole pH (pH(v)) in 4,606 single-gene deletion mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under control, acid and alkali stress conditions to reveal the vacuolar pH-stat. Median pH(v) (5.27±0.13) was resistant to acid stress (5.28±0.14) but shifted significantly in response to alkali stress (5.83±0.13). Of 107 mutants that displayed aberrant pH(v) under more than one external pH condition, functional categories of transporters, membrane biogenesis and trafficking machinery were significantly enriched. Phospholipid flippases, encoded by the family of P4-type ATPases, emerged as pH regulators, as did the yeast ortholog of Niemann Pick Type C protein, implicated in sterol trafficking. An independent genetic screen revealed that correction of pH(v) dysregulation in a neo1(ts) mutant restored viability whereas cholesterol accumulation in human NPC1(-/-) fibroblasts diminished upon treatment with a proton ionophore. Furthermore, while it is established that lumenal pH affects trafficking, this study revealed a reciprocal link with many mutants defective in anterograde pathways being hyperacidic and retrograde pathway mutants with alkaline vacuoles. In these and other examples, pH perturbations emerge as a hitherto unrecognized phenotype that may contribute to the cellular basis of disease and offer potential therapeutic intervention through pH modulation."
https://openalex.org/W1969875074,"Airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion and mucus accumulation occur in cystic fibrosis (CF). The ASL comprises a superficial mucus layer (ML) overlying a periciliary fluid layer (PCL) that contacts surface epithelial cells. We measured viscosity of the ML and PCL from the diffusion of FITC-dextran dissolved in the ASL of unperturbed, well-differentiated primary cultures of human bronchial epithelia grown at an air-liquid interface. Diffusion was measured by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, using a perfluorocarbon immersion lens and confocal fluorescence detection. Bleaching of an in-plane 6-μm-wide region was done in which diffusion coefficients were computed using solution standards of specified viscosity and finite-element computations of 2-layer dye diffusion in 3 dimensions. We found remarkably elevated viscosity in both ML and PCL of CF vs. non-CF bronchial epithelial cell cultures. Relative viscosities (with saline = 1) were in the range 7–10 in the non-CF ML and PCL, and 25–30 in both ML and PCL in CF, and greatly reduced by amiloride treatment or mucin washout. These data indicate that the CF airway surface epithelium, even without hyperviscous secretions from submucosal glands, produces an intrinsically hyperviscous PCL and ML, which likely contributes to CF lung disease by impairment of mucociliary clearance. Our results challenge the view that the PCL is a relatively watery, nonviscous fluid layer in contact with a more viscous ML, and offer an explanation for CF lung disease in the gland-free lower airways.—Derichs, N., Jin, B. -J., Song, Y., Finkbeiner, W.

https://openalex.org/W2052721884,"The HIV-1 matrix protein p17 is a structural protein that can act in the extracellular environment to deregulate several functions of immune cells, through the interaction of its NH(2)-terminal region with a cellular surface receptor (p17R). The intracellular events triggered by p17/p17R interaction have been not completely characterized yet. In this study we analyze the signal transduction pathways induced by p17/p17R interaction and show that in Raji cells, a human B cell line stably expressing p17R on its surface, p17 induces a transient activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1. Moreover, it was found to upregulate pERK1/2 and downregulate pAkt, which are the major intracellular signalling components involved in AP-1 activation. These effects are mediated by the COOH-terminal region of p17, which displays the capability of keeping PTEN, a phosphatase that regulates the PI3K/Akt pathway, in an active state through the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase ROCK. Indeed, the COOH-terminal truncated form of p17 (p17Δ36) induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by maintaining PTEN in an inactive phosphorylated form. Interestingly, we show that among different p17s, a variant derived from a Ugandan HIV-1 strain, named S75X, triggers an activation of PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, and leads to an increased B cell proliferation and malignant transformation. In summary, this study shows the role of the COOH-terminal region in modulating the p17 signalling pathways so highlighting the complexity of p17 binding to and signalling through its receptor(s). Moreover, it provides the first evidence on the presence of a p17 natural variant mimicking the p17Δ36-induced signalling in B cells and displaying the capacity of promoting B cell growth and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2129532370,"The tumor suppressor gene p27Kip1 plays a fundamental role in human cancer progression. Its expression and/or functions are altered in almost all the different tumor histotype analyzed so far. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the tumor suppression function of p27 resides not only in the ability to inhibit Cyclins/CDKs complexes through its N-terminal domain but also in the capacity to modulate cell motility through its C-terminal portion. Particular interest has been raised by the last amino-acid, (Threonine 198) in the regulation of both protein stability and cell motility. Here, we describe that the presence of Threonine in position 198 is of primary importance for the regulation of the protein stability and for the control of cell motility. However, while the control of cell motility is dependent on the phosphorylation of T198, the stability of the protein is specifically controlled by the steric hindrance of the last amino acid. The effects of T198 modification on protein stability are not linked to the capacity of p27 to bind Cyclins/CDKs complexes and/or the F-box protein Skp2. Conversely, our results support the hypothesis that conformational changes in the disordered structure of the C-terminal portion of p27 are important in its ability to be degraded via a proteasome-dependent mechanism. On the other hand T198 phosphorylation favors p27/stathmin interaction eventually contributing to the regulation of cell motility, supporting the hypothesis that the presence of T198 is fundamental for the regulation of p27 functions."

IL-8 importance in malignancies has been ascribed to angiogenesis promotion.IL-8 effects on human monocyte-derived DC biology were explored upon DC exposure to recombinant IL-8 and with the help of an IL-8 neutralizing mAb. In vivo experiments were performed in immunodeficient mice xenografted with IL-8-producing human colon carcinomas and comparatively with cell lines that do not produce IL-8. Allogenic T lymphocyte stimulation by DC was explored under the influence of IL-8. DC and neutrophil chemotaxis were measured by transwell-migration assays. Sera from tumor-xenografted mice contained increasing concentrations of IL-8 as the tumors progress. IL-8 production by carcinoma cells can be modulated by low doses of cyclophosphamide at the transcription level. If human DC are injected into HT29 or CaCo2 xenografted tumors, DC are retained intratumorally in an IL-8-dependent fashion. However, IL-8 did not modify the ability of DC to stimulate T cells. Interestingly, pre-exposure of DC to IL-8 desensitizes such cells for IL-8-mediated in vitro or in vivo chemoattraction. Thereby DC become disoriented to subsequently follow IL-8 chemotactic gradients towards malignant or inflamed tissue.IL-8 as produced by carcinoma cells changes DC migration cues, without directly interfering with DC-mediated T-cell stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2122579597,"Prenatal exposure to alcohol is thought to be the most prevalent nongenetic cause of a wide range of neurodevelopmental deficits. Insufficient thyroid hormone levels are one mechanism that hampers development of the alcohol-exposed brain, and we hypothesized that altered dosage of the imprinted thyroid hormone-inactivating gene deiodinase-III (Dio3) is responsible. To follow parent-of-origin allelic expression of Dio3 in the fetal and adult offspring of alcohol-consuming and control dams, we reciprocally crossed 2 polymorphic rat strains. In the frontal cortex, prenatal alcohol exposure altered imprinting patterns and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and produced a permanent hypothyroid milieu in the adult. In the hippocampus, alcohol affected the paternal and total expression of Dio3 in the fetus and in the adult male, where thyroid hormone levels were concomitantly increased. Hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits were identified exclusively in males, suggesting they are dependent on aberrant allelic Dio3 expression. None of these effects were observed in offspring of the reciprocal cross. Thus, genetic background and sex modify vulnerability to prenatal alcohol via brain region-specific expression of Dio3. This finding implies that phenotypic heterogeneity in human fetal alcohol spectrum disorder can be linked to genetic vulnerability in affected brain regions.—Sittig, L. J., Shukla, P. K., Herzing, L.

Herein, we investigated the extent to which lentivirus infections affected mucosal integrity and intestinal permeability in conjunction with immune responses and activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways. Duodenal biopsies from individuals with HIV/AIDS exhibited induction of IL-1β, CD3ε, HLA-DRA, spliced XBP-1(Xbp-1s), and CHOP expression compared to uninfected persons (P<0.05). Gut epithelial cells exposed to HIV-1 Vpr demonstrated elevated TNF-α, IL-1β, spliced Xbp-1s, and CHOP expression (P<0.05) together with calcium activation and disruption of epithelial cell monolayer permeability. In addition to reduced blood CD4(+) T lymphocyte levels, viral loads in the gut and plasma were high in FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). FIV-infected animals also exhibited a failure to gain weight and increased lactulose/mannitol ratios compared with uninfected animals (P<0.05). Proinflammatory and ER stress gene expression were activated in the ileum of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05), accompanied by intestinal epithelial damage with loss of epithelial cells and leukocyte infiltration of the lamina propria. Lentivirus infections cause gut inflammation and ensuing damage to intestinal epithelial cells, likely through induction of ER stress pathways, resulting in disruption of gut functional integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2029682882,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can transport macromolecular cargos into live cells. However, the cellular delivery efficiency of these reagents is often suboptimal because CPP-cargo conjugates typically remain trapped inside endosomes. Interestingly, irradiation of fluorescently labeled CPPs with light increases the release of the peptide and its cargos into the cytosol. However, the mechanism of this phenomenon is not clear. Here we investigate the molecular basis of the photo-induced endosomolytic activity of the prototypical CPPs TAT labeled to the fluorophore 5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TMR).We report that TMR-TAT acts as a photosensitizer that can destroy membranes. TMR-TAT escapes from endosomes after exposure to moderate light doses. However, this is also accompanied by loss of plasma membrane integrity, membrane blebbing, and cell-death. In addition, the peptide causes the destruction of cells when applied extracellularly and also triggers the photohemolysis of red blood cells. These photolytic and photocytotoxic effects were inhibited by hydrophobic singlet oxygen quenchers but not by hydrophilic quenchers.Together, these results suggest that TAT can convert an innocuous fluorophore such as TMR into a potent photolytic agent. This effect involves the targeting of the fluorophore to cellular membranes and the production of singlet oxygen within the hydrophobic environment of the membranes. Our findings may be relevant for the design of reagents with photo-induced endosomolytic activity. The photocytotoxicity exhibited by TMR-TAT also suggests that CPP-chromophore conjugates could aid the development of novel Photodynamic Therapy agents."

https://openalex.org/W2075191596,"Bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are related orbiviruses, transmitted between their ruminant hosts primarily by certain haematophagous midge vectors (Culicoides spp.). The larger of the BTV outer-capsid proteins, ‘VP2’, can be cleaved by proteases (including trypsin or chymotrypsin), forming infectious subviral particles (ISVP) which have enhanced infectivity for adult Culicoides, or KC cells (a cell-line derived from C. sonorensis). We demonstrate that VP2 present on purified virus particles from 3 different BTV strains can also be cleaved by treatment with saliva from adult Culicoides. The saliva proteins from C. sonorensis (a competent BTV vector), cleaved BTV-VP2 more efficiently than those from C. nubeculosus (a less competent / non-vector species). Electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified a trypsin-like protease in C. sonorensis saliva, which was significantly reduced or absent from C. nubeculosus saliva. Incubating purified BTV-1 with C. sonorensis saliva proteins also increased their infectivity for KC cells ∼10 fold, while infectivity for BHK cells was reduced by 2–6 fold. Treatment of an ‘eastern’ strain of EHDV-2 with saliva proteins of either C. sonorensis or C. nubeculosus cleaved VP2, but a ‘western’ strain of EHDV-2 remained unmodified. These results indicate that temperature, strain of virus and protein composition of Culicoides saliva (particularly its protease content which is dependent upon vector species), can all play a significant role in the efficiency of VP2 cleavage, influencing virus infectivity. Saliva of several other arthropod species has previously been shown to increase transmission, infectivity and virulence of certain arboviruses, by modulating and/or suppressing the mammalian immune response. The findings presented here, however, demonstrate a novel mechanism by which proteases in Culicoides saliva can also directly modify the orbivirus particle structure, leading to increased infectivity specifically for Culicoides cells and, in turn, efficiency of transmission to the insect vector."
https://openalex.org/W2122427546,"The calcium-calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin plays an important regulatory role in muscle differentiation, fiber-type determination, hypertrophy, and muscle regeneration. Because calcineurin functions in numerous processes in muscle, multiple mechanisms are likely necessary to ensure that the activity of this phosphatase is appropriately regulated. Here we demonstrate that the muscle-specific scaffolding protein myospryn modulates calcineurin signaling by inhibiting calcineurin-dependent transcriptional activity in C2C12 myoblasts through direct interaction with the enzyme via its noncanonical tripartite motif (TRIM-like). Consistent with these data, transgenic mice overexpressing both the TRIM-like domain of myospryn and constitutively active calcineurin displayed a severe attenuation in the ability of calcineurin to induce a slow-fiber phenotype. Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing the TRIM-like domain of myospryn displayed attenuated muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury. These results indicate that myospryn functions as a novel inhibitor of the calcineurin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.— Kielbasa, O. M., Reynolds, J. G., Wu, C-l., Snyder, C. M., Cho, M.

https://openalex.org/W2000800295,"HIV-1 CRF02_AG and subtype G (HIV-1G) account for most HIV infections in Nigeria, but their evolutionary trends have not been well documented. To better elucidate the dynamics of the epidemic in Nigeria we characterised the gag and env genes of North-Central Nigerian HIV-1 isolates from pregnant women. Of 28 samples sequenced in both genes, the predominant clades were CRF02_AG (39%) and HIV-1G (32%). Higher predicted proportion of CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1G isolates was noted compared to CRF02_AG (p = 0.007, Fisher's exact test). Phylogenetic and Bayesian analysis conducted on our sequences and all the dated available Nigerian sequences on the Los Alamos data base showed that CRF02_AG and HIV-1G entered into Nigeria through multiple entries, with presence of HIV-1G dating back to early 1980s. This study underlines the genetic complexity of the HIV-1 epidemic in Nigeria, possible subtype-specific differences in co-receptor usage, and the evolutionary trends of the predominant HIV-1 strains in Nigeria, which may have implications for the design of biomedical interventions and better understanding of the epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2153446403,"Fusion of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) with target cells is mediated by the gp41 transmembrane envelope protein. The loop region within gp41 contains 2 crucial cysteines that play an unknown role in HIV-cell fusion. On the basis of cell-cell fusion assay, using human T-cell lines [Jurkat E6-1 and Jurkat HXBc2(4)], and virus-cell fusion assay, using fully infectious HIV-1 HXBc2 virus and TZM-bl human cell line, we provide evidence that the oxidation state of the disulfide bond within a loop domain peptide determines its activity. The oxidized (closed) form inhibits fusion, while the reduced (opened) form enhances hemifusion. These opposite activities reach 60% difference in viral fusion. Both forms of the loop domain interact with gp41: the opened form enhances gp41 folding into a bundle, whereas the closed form inhibits this folding. Therefore, the transformation of the cysteines from a reduced to an oxidized state enables the loop to convert from opened to closed conformations, which assists gp41 to fold and induces hemifusion. The significant conservation of the loop region within many envelope proteins suggests a general mechanism, which is exploited by viruses to enhance entry into their host cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970519420,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CAG repeat polymorphism and X-chromosome Inactivation (XCI) pattern in Recurrent Spontaneous Abortions among Indian women which has not been hitherto explored. 117 RSA cases and 224 Controls were included in the study. Cases were recruited from two different hospitals - Lakshmi Fertility Clinic, Nellore and Fernandez Maternity Hospital, Hyderabad. Controls were roughly matched for age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The CAG repeats of the Androgen Receptor gene were genotyped using a PCR-based assay and were analysed using the GeneMapper software to determine the CAG repeat length. XCI analysis was also carried out to assess the inactivation percentages. RSA cases had a significantly greater frequency of allele sizes in the polymorphic range above 19 repeats (p = 0.006), which is the median value of the controls, and in the biallelic mean range above 21 repeats (p = 0.002). We found no evidence of abnormal incidence of skewed X-inactivation. We conclude that longer CAG repeat lengths are associated with increased odds for RSA with statistical power estimated to be ∼90%."
https://openalex.org/W2128171553,"Hair growth is a highly regulated cyclical process. Immunosuppressive immunophilin ligands such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 are known as potent hair growth modulatory agents in rodents and humans that induce active hair growth and inhibit hair follicle regression. The immunosuppressive effectiveness of these drugs has been generally attributed to inhibition of T cell activation through well-characterized pathways. Specifically, CsA and FK506 bind to intracellular proteins, principally cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively, and thereby inhibit the phosphatase calcineurin (Cn). The calcineurin (Cn)/NFAT pathway has an important, but poorly understood, role in the regulation of hair follicle development. Here we show that a novel-splicing variant of calcineurin Aß CnAß-FK, which is encoded by an intron-retaining mRNA and is deficient in the autoinhibitory domain, is predominantly expressed in mature follicular keratinocytes but not in the proliferating keratinocytes of rodents. CnAß-FK was weakly sensitive to Ca2+ and dephosphorylated NFATc2 under low Ca2+ levels in keratinocytes. Inhibition of Cn/NFAT induced hair growth in nude mice. Cyclin G2 was identified as a novel target of the Cn/NFATc2 pathway and its expression in follicular keratinocytes was reduced by inhibition of Cn/NFAT. Overexpression of cyclin G2 arrested the cell cycle in follicular keratinocytes in vitro and the Cn inhibitor, cyclosporin A, inhibited nuclear localization of NFATc2, resulting in decreased cyclin G2 expression in follicular keratinocytes of rats in vivo. We therefore suggest that the calcineurin/NFAT pathway has a unique regulatory role in hair follicle development."

We show that the reconstitution capacity of transferred isolated naïve CD8+ T cells and their differentiation of effector functions is limited, but both dramatically increase upon the co-transfer of CD4+ T cells. This helper effect is complex and determined by multiple factors. It was directly correlated to the number of helper cells, required the continuous presence of the CD4+ T cells, dependent on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing CD40 and on the formation of CD4/CD8/APC cell clusters. By comparing the recovery of (CD44+CD62Lhigh) TCM and (CD44+CD62Llow) TEM CD8+ T cells, we found that the accumulation of TCM and TEM subsets is differentially regulated. TCM-cell accumulation depended mainly on type I interferons, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-15, but was independent of CD4+ T-cell help. In contrast, TEM-cell expansion was mainly determined by CD4+ T-cell help and dependent on the expression of IL-2Rβ by CD8 cells, on IL-2 produced by CD4+ T-cells, on IL-15 and to a minor extent on IL-6."
