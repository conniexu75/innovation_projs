https://openalex.org/W2011697200,"Background Weak intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are key players in stabilizing energetically-favored ligands, in an open conformational environment of protein structures. However, it is still poorly understood how the binding parameters associated with these interactions facilitate a drug-lead to recognize a specific target and improve drugs efficacy. To understand this, comprehensive analysis of hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding and binding affinity have been analyzed at the interface of c-Src and c-Abl kinases and 4-amino substituted 1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d] pyrimidine compounds. Methodology In-silico docking studies were performed, using Discovery Studio software modules LigandFit, CDOCKER and ZDOCK, to investigate the role of ligand binding affinity at the hydrophobic pocket of c-Src and c-Abl kinase. Hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions of docked molecules were compared using LigPlot program. Furthermore, 3D-QSAR and MFA calculations were scrutinized to quantify the role of weak interactions in binding affinity and drug efficacy. Conclusions The in-silico method has enabled us to reveal that a multi-targeted small molecule binds with low affinity to its respective targets. But its binding affinity can be altered by integrating the conformationally favored functional groups at the active site of the ligand-target interface. Docking studies of 4-amino-substituted molecules at the bioactive cascade of the c-Src and c-Abl have concluded that 3D structural folding at the protein-ligand groove is also a hallmark for molecular recognition of multi-targeted compounds and for predicting their biological activity. The results presented here demonstrate that hydrogen bonding and optimized hydrophobic interactions both stabilize the ligands at the target site, and help alter binding affinity and drug efficacy."

Approximately 1,250,000 individuals have chronic SCI in the U.S.; therefore treatment in the chronic stages is highly clinically relevant. Human neural stem cells (hCNS-SCns) were prospectively isolated based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting for a CD133+ and CD24−/lo population from fetal brain, grown as neurospheres, and lineage restricted to generate neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. hCNS-SCns have recently been transplanted sub-acutely following spinal cord injury and found to promote improved locomotor recovery. We tested the ability of hCNS-SCns transplanted 30 days post SCI to survive, differentiate, migrate, and promote improved locomotor recovery. Methods and Findings hCNS-SCns were transplanted into immunodeficient NOD-scid mice 30 days post spinal cord contusion injury. hCNS-SCns transplanted mice demonstrated significantly improved locomotor recovery compared to vehicle controls using open field locomotor testing and CatWalk gait analysis. Transplanted hCNS-SCns exhibited long-term engraftment, migration, limited proliferation, and differentiation predominantly to oligodendrocytes and neurons. Astrocytic differentiation was rare and mice did not exhibit mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, differentiated hCNS-SCns integrated with the host as demonstrated by co-localization of human cytoplasm with discrete staining for the paranodal marker contactin-associated protein. Conclusions The results suggest that hCNS-SCns are capable of surviving, differentiating, and promoting improved locomotor recovery when transplanted into an early chronic injury microenvironment. These data suggest that hCNS-SCns transplantation has efficacy in an early chronic SCI setting and thus expands the “window of opportunity” for intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2076047037,"Alteration and/or mutations of the ribonucleoprotein TDP-43 have been firmly linked to human neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The relative impacts of TDP-43 alteration, mutation, or inherent protein function on neural integrity, however, remain less clear--a situation confounded by conflicting reports based on transient and/or random-insertion transgenic expression. We therefore performed a stringent comparative investigation of impacts of these TDP-43 modifications on neural integrity in vivo. To achieve this, we systematically screened ALS/FTLD-associated and synthetic TDP-43 isoforms via same-site gene insertion and neural expression in Drosophila; followed by transposon-based motor neuron-specific transgenesis in a chick vertebrate system. Using this bi-systemic approach we uncovered a requirement of inherent TDP-43 RNA-binding function--but not ALS/FTLD-linked mutation, mislocalization, or truncation--for TDP-43-mediated neurotoxicity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2116743345,"Significant shifts in climate are considered a threat to plants and animals with significant physiological limitations and limited dispersal abilities. The southern Appalachian Mountains are a global hotspot for plethodontid salamander diversity. Plethodontids are lungless ectotherms, so their ecology is strongly governed by temperature and precipitation. Many plethodontid species in southern Appalachia exist in high elevation habitats that may be at or near their thermal maxima, and may also have limited dispersal abilities across warmer valley bottoms.We used a maximum-entropy approach (program Maxent) to model the suitable climatic habitat of 41 plethodontid salamander species inhabiting the Appalachian Highlands region (33 individual species and eight species included within two species complexes). We evaluated the relative change in suitable climatic habitat for these species in the Appalachian Highlands from the current climate to the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, using both the HADCM3 and the CGCM3 models, each under low and high CO(2) scenarios, and using two-model thresholds levels (relative suitability thresholds for determining suitable/unsuitable range), for a total of 8 scenarios per species.While models differed slightly, every scenario projected significant declines in suitable habitat within the Appalachian Highlands as early as 2020. Species with more southern ranges and with smaller ranges had larger projected habitat loss. Despite significant differences in projected precipitation changes to the region, projections did not differ significantly between global circulation models. CO(2) emissions scenario and model threshold had small effects on projected habitat loss by 2020, but did not affect longer-term projections. Results of this study indicate that choice of model threshold and CO(2) emissions scenario affect short-term projected shifts in climatic distributions of species; however, these factors and choice of global circulation model have relatively small affects on what is significant projected loss of habitat for many salamander species that currently occupy the Appalachian Highlands."
https://openalex.org/W2030049281,"Mechanosensitive channels serve as essential sensors for cells to interact with their environment. The identity of mechanosensitive channels that underlie somatosensory touch transduction is still a mystery. One promising mechanotransduction candidate is the Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) ion channel. To determine the role of TRPA1 in the generation of mechanically-sensitive currents, we used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron cultures from adult mice and applied rapid focal mechanical stimulation (indentation) to the soma membrane. Small neurons (diameter <27 µm) were studied because TRPA1 is functionally present in these neurons which largely give rise to C-fiber afferents in vivo. Small neurons were classified by isolectin B4 binding. Mechanically-activated inward currents were classified into two subtypes: Slowly Adapting and Transient. First, significantly more IB4 negative neurons (84%) responded to mechanical stimulation than IB4 positive neurons (54%). Second, 89% of Slowly Adapting currents were present in IB4 negative neurons whereas only 11% were found in IB4 positive neurons. Third, Slowly Adapting currents were completely absent in IB4 negative neurons from TRPA1−/− mice. Consistent with this, Slowly Adapting currents were abolished in wild type IB4 negative neurons stimulated in the presence of a TRPA1 antagonist, HC-030031. In addition, the amplitude of Transient mechanically-activated currents in IB4 positive neurons from TRPA1−/− mice was reduced by over 60% compared to TRPA1+/+ controls; however, a similar reduction did not occur in wild-type neurons treated with HC-030031. Transfection of TRPA1 in HEK293 cells did not significantly alter the proportion or magnitude of mechanically-activated currents in HEK293 cells, indicating that TRPA1 alone is not sufficient to confer mechanical sensitivity. These parallel genetic and pharmacological data demonstrate that TRPA1 mediates the Slowly Adapting mechanically-activated currents in small-diameter IB4 negative neurons from adult mice. The TRPA1 protein may also contribute to a complex that mediates Transient mechanically-activated currents in small IB4 positive C fiber type neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2030151999,"Negative or positive feedback between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and host plants can contribute to plant species interactions, but how this feedback affects plant invasion or resistance to invasion is not well known. Here we tested how alterations in AMF community induced by an invasive plant species generate feedback to the invasive plant itself and affect subsequent interactions between the invasive species and its native neighbors. We first examined the effects of the invasive forb Solidago canadensis L. on AMF communities comprising five different AMF species. We then examined the effects of the altered AMF community on mutualisms formed with the native legume forb species Kummerowia striata (Thunb.) Schindl. and on the interaction between the invasive and native plants. The host preferences of the five AMF were also assessed to test whether the AMF form preferred mutualistic relations with the invasive and/or the native species. We found that S. canadensis altered AMF spore composition by increasing one AMF species (Glomus geosporum) while reducing Glomus mosseae, which is the dominant species in the field. The host preference test showed that S. canadensis had promoted the abundance of AMF species (G. geosporum) that most promoted its own growth. As a consequence, the altered AMF community enhanced the competitiveness of invasive S. canadensis at the expense of K. striata. Our results demonstrate that the invasive S. canadensis alters soil AMF community composition because of fungal-host preference. This change in the composition of the AMF community generates positive feedback to the invasive S. canadensis itself and decreases AM associations with native K. striata, thereby making the native K. striata less dominant."
https://openalex.org/W1973897738,"The lipase activity of most phospholipases C (PLCs) is basally repressed by a highly degenerate and mostly disordered X/Y linker inserted within the catalytic domain. Release of this auto-inhibition is driven by electrostatic repulsion between the plasma membrane and the electronegative X/Y linker. In contrast, PLC-γ isozymes (PLC-γ1 and -γ2) are structurally distinct from other PLCs because multiple domains are present in their X/Y linker. Moreover, although many tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate PLC-γ isozymes to enhance their lipase activity, the underlying molecular mechanism of this activation remains unclear. Here we define the mechanism for the unique regulation of PLC-γ isozymes by their X/Y linker. Specifically, we identify the C-terminal SH2 domain within the X/Y linker as the critical determinant for auto-inhibition. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the X/Y linker mediates high affinity intramolecular interaction with the C-terminal SH2 domain that is coupled to a large conformational rearrangement and release of auto-inhibition. Consequently, PLC-γ isozymes link phosphorylation to phospholipase activation by elaborating upon primordial regulatory mechanisms found in other PLCs.

The X/Y linker of these PLCs is highly negatively charged, mostly disordered, and prevents PtdIns(4,5)P2 access to the active site by a combination of steric exclusion and electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged membranes. Consequently, we proposed a general mechanism of interfacial activation of these isozymes in which any upstream input that preferentially orients the active site toward PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes would remove the X/Y linker to allow access of substrate for hydrolysis (4Hicks S.N.

Here 17 of 73 patients exhibited elevated muscle TNF-α mRNA levels. In these patients, significantly lower mRNA levels of all oxidative markers/regulators were found. Interestingly, these patients also had a significantly lower body mass index and tended to have less muscle mass. In cultured muscle cells, mitochondrial protein content and myosin heavy chain isoform I (but not II) protein and mRNA levels were reduced on chronic TNF-α stimulation. TNF-α also reduced mitochondrial respiration in a nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) -dependent manner. Importantly, TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation decreased promoter transactivation and transcriptional activity of regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and muscle oxphen. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that TNF-α impairs muscle oxphen in a NF-κB-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1983803126,"Inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 is critical for glial function, control of neuronal excitability, and systemic K(+) homeostasis. Novel mutations in Kir4.1 have been associated with EAST/SeSAME syndrome, characterized by mental retardation, ataxia, seizures, hearing loss, and renal salt waste. Patients are homozygous for R65P, G77R, C140R or T164I; or compound heterozygous for A167V/R297C or R65P/R199Stop, a deletion of the C-terminal half of the protein. We investigated the functional significance of these mutations by radiotracer efflux and inside-out membrane patch clamping in COSm6 cells expressing homomeric Kir4.1 or heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels. All of the mutations compromised channel function, but the underlying mechanisms were different. R65P, T164I, and R297C caused an alkaline shift in pH sensitivity, indicating that these positions are crucial for pH sensing and pore gating. In R297C, this was due to disruption of intersubunit salt bridge Glu(288)-Arg(297). C140R breaks the Cys(108)-Cys(140) disulfide bond essential for protein folding and function. A167V did not affect channel properties but may contribute to decreased surface expression in A167V/R297C. In G77R, introduction of a positive charge within the bilayer may affect channel structure or gating. R199Stop led to a dramatic decrease in surface expression, but channel activity was restored by co-expression with intact subunits, suggesting remarkable tolerance for truncation of the cytoplasmic domain. These results provide an explanation for the molecular defects that underlie the EAST/SeSAME syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2090602226,"Galectins are defined by a conserved β-galactoside binding site that has been linked to many of their important functions in e.g. cell adhesion, signaling, and intracellular trafficking. Weak adjacent sites may enhance or decrease affinity for natural β-galactoside-containing glycoconjugates, but little is known about the biological role of this modulation of affinity (fine specificity). We have now produced 10 mutants of human galectin-3, with changes in these adjacent sites that have altered carbohydrate-binding fine specificity but that retain the basic β-galactoside binding activity as shown by glycan-array binding and a solution-based fluorescence anisotropy assay. Each mutant was also tested in two biological assays to provide a correlation between fine specificity and function. Galectin-3 R186S, which has selectively lost affinity for LacNAc, a disaccharide moiety commonly found on glycoprotein glycans, has lost the ability to activate neutrophil leukocytes and intracellular targeting into vesicles. K176L has increased affinity for β-galactosides substituted with GlcNAcβ1-3, as found in poly-N-acetyllactosaminoglycans, and increased potency to activate neutrophil leukocytes even though it has lost other aspects of galectin-3 fine specificity. G182A has altered carbohydrate-binding fine specificity and altered intracellular targeting into vesicles, a possible link to the intracellular galectin-3-mediated anti-apoptotic effect known to be lost by this mutant. Finally, the mutants have helped to define the differences in fine specificity shown by Xenopus, mouse, and human galectin-3 and, as such, the evidence for adaptive change during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2020466852,"The acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) gene gives rise to two distinct enzymes, lysosomal sphingomyelinase (L-SMase) and secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase), via differential trafficking of a common protein precursor. However, the regulation of S-SMase and its role in cytokine-induced ceramide formation remain ill defined. To determine the role of S-SMase in cellular sphingolipid metabolism, MCF7 breast carcinoma cells stably transfected with V5-aSMase(WT) were treated with inflammatory cytokines. Interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α induced a time- and dose-dependent increase in S-SMase secretion and activity, coincident with selective elevations in cellular C(16)-ceramide. To establish a role for S-SMase, we utilized a mutant of aSMase (S508A) that is shown to retain L-SMase activity, but is defective in secretion. MCF7 expressing V5-aSMase(WT) exhibited increased S-SMase and L-SMase activity, as well as elevated cellular levels of specific long-chain and very long-chain ceramide species relative to vector control MCF7. Interestingly, elevated levels of only certain very long-chain ceramides were evident in V5-aSMase(S508A) MCF7. Secretion of the S508A mutant was also defective in response to IL-1β, as was the regulated generation of C(16)-ceramide. Taken together, these data support a crucial role for Ser(508) in the regulation of S-SMase secretion, and they suggest distinct metabolic roles for S-SMase and L-SMase."

https://openalex.org/W2125146125,"Many bats vocalizing through their nose carry a prominent noseleaf that is involved in shaping the emission beam of these animals. To our knowledge, the exact role of these appendages has not been thoroughly investigated as for no single species both the hearing and the emission spatial sensitivities have been obtained. In this paper, we set out to evaluate the complete spatial sensitivity of two species of New World leaf-nosed bats: Micronycteris microtis and Phyllostomus discolor. From an ecological point of view, these species are interesting as they belong to the same family (Phyllostomidae) and their noseleaves are morphologically similar. They differ vastly in the niche they occupy. Comparing these species allows us to relate differences in function of the noseleaf to the ecological background of bat species.We simulate the spatial sensitivity of both the hearing and the emission subsystems of two species, M. microtis and P. discolor. This technique allows us to evaluate the respective roles played by the noseleaf in the echolocation system of these species. We find that the noseleaf of M. microtis focuses the radiated energy better and yields better control over the emission beam.From the evidence presented we conclude that the noseleaves serve quantitatively different functions for different bats. The main function of the noseleaf is to serve as an energy focusing mechanism that increases the difference between the reflected energy from objects in the focal area and objects in the periphery. However, despite the gross morphological similarities between the noseleaves of the two Phyllostomid species they focus the energy to a different extent, a capability that can be linked to the different ecological niches occupied by the two species."
https://openalex.org/W1987622202,"Background Human uterine leiomyomas (ULM) are characterized by dysregulation of a large number of genes and non-coding regulatory microRNAs. In order to identify microRNA::mRNA associations relevant to ULM pathogenesis, we examined global correlation patterns between the altered microRNA expression and the predicted target genes in ULMs and matched myometria. Methodology/Principal Findings Patterns of inverse association of microRNA with mRNA expression in ULMs revealed an involvement of multiple candidate pathways, including extensive transcriptional reprogramming, cell proliferation control, MAP kinase, TGF-β, WNT, JAK/STAT signaling, remodeling of cell adhesion, and cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. We further examined the correlation between the expression of the selected target gene protein products and microRNAs in thirty-six paired sets of leiomyomas and matched myometria. We found that a number of dysregulated microRNAs were inversely correlated with their targets at the protein level. The comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in eight ULM patients revealed that partially shared deletions of two distinct chromosomal regions might be responsible for loss of cancer–associated microRNA expression and could thus contribute to the ULM pathogenesis via deregulation of target mRNAs. Last, we functionally tested the repressor effects of selected cancer-related microRNAs on their predicted target genes in vitro. Conclusions/Significance We found that some but not all of the predicted and inversely correlated target genes in ULMs can be directly regulated by microRNAs in vitro. Our findings provide a broad overview of molecular events underlying the tumorigenesis of uterine ULMs and identify select genetic and regulatory events that alter microRNA expression and may play important roles in ULM pathobiology by positively regulating tumor growth while maintaining the non-invasive character of ULMs."
https://openalex.org/W1982790305,"Background Energy deficiency and mitochondrial failure have been recognized as a prominent, early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we demonstrated that chronic exposure to amyloid-beta (Aβ) in human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing human wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) resulted in (i) activity changes of complexes III and IV of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) and in (ii) a drop of ATP levels which may finally instigate loss of synapses and neuronal cell death in AD. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether standardized Ginkgo biloba extract LI 1370 (GBE) is able to rescue Aβ-induced defects in energy metabolism. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a high-resolution respiratory protocol to evaluate OXPHOS respiratory capacity under physiological condition in control (stably transfected with the empty vector) and APP cells after treatment with GBE. In addition, oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria, activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes, ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels as well as mitochondrial membrane mass and mitochondrial DNA content were determined. We observed a general antioxidant effect of GBE leading to an increase of the coupling state of mitochondria as well as energy homeostasis and a reduction of ROS levels in control cells and in APP cells. GBE effect on OXPHOS was even preserved in mitochondria after isolation from treated cells. Moreover, these functional data were paralleled by an up-regulation of mitochondrial DNA. Improvement of the OXPHOS efficiency was stronger in APP cells than in control cells. In APP cells, the GBE-induced amelioration of oxygen consumption most likely arose from the modulation and respective normalization of the Aβ-induced disturbance in the activity of mitochondrial complexes III and IV restoring impaired ATP levels possibly through decreasing Aβ and oxidative stress level. Conclusions/Significance Although the underlying molecular mechanisms of the mode of action of GBE remain to be determined, our study clearly highlights the beneficial effect of GBE on the cellular OXPHOS performance and restoration of Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction."

The subjects examined in most of these studies had a European origin. However, considering the distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns in European and other ethnic populations, it would be of tremendous interest to determine whether such associations could be replicated in populations of other ethnicities, such as Asians. In this study, we performed comprehensive association and interaction analyses for 32 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CHRNA5/A3/B4 with smoking initiation (SI), smoking quantity (SQ), and smoking cessation (SC) in a Korean sample (N = 8,842). We found nominally significant associations of 7 SNPs with at least one smoking-related phenotype in the total sample (SI: P = 0.015 approximately 0.023; SQ: P = 0.008 approximately 0.028; SC: P = 0.018 approximately 0.047) and the male sample (SI: P = 0.001 approximately 0.023; SQ: P = 0.001 approximately 0.046; SC: P = 0.01). A spectrum of haplotypes formed by three consecutive SNPs located between rs16969948 in CHRNA5 and rs6495316 in the intergenic region downstream from the 5' end of CHRNB4 was associated with these three smoking-related phenotypes in both the total and the male sample. Notably, associations of these variants and haplotypes with SC appear to be much weaker than those with SI and SQ. In addition, we performed an interaction analysis of SNPs within the cluster using the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method and found a significant interaction of SNPs rs7163730 in LOC123688, rs6495308 in CHRNA3, and rs7166158, rs8043123, and rs11072793 in the intergenic region downstream from the 5' end of CHRNB4 to be influencing SI in the male sample. Considering that fewer than 5% of the female participants were smokers, we did not perform any analysis on female subjects specifically. Together, our detected associations of variants in the CHRNA5/A3/B4 cluster with SI, SQ, and SC in the Korean smoker samples provide strong evidence for the contribution of this cluster to the etiology of SI, ND, and SC in this Asian population."

IntroductionThe binding of cytokines or growth factors to cognate receptors initiates a cascade of molecular events that culminate in the activation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family of proteins (1Bromberg J.

Among these is the recruitment of STATs, via the SH2 domain, to the receptor phosphotyrosine (pTyr) 2The abbreviations used are: pTyr or pYphosphorylated tyrosineSH2Src homology 2EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorErkMAPKextracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinaseGOLDgenetic optimization for ligand dockingSPRsurface plasmon resonanceFPfluorescence polarization. peptide motifs, which brings them into close proximity for phosphorylation on a key tyrosyl residue by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, Janus kinases (Jaks), and the Src family kinases. Consequently, dimerization between two STAT monomers is promoted through a reciprocal pTyr-SH2 domain interaction, and the active STAT dimers in the nucleus bind to specific DNA-response elements in the promoters of target genes and regulate gene expression. In response to growth factors and cytokines, normal STAT signaling promotes cell growth and differentiation, development, inflammation, and immune responses.The STAT proteins are modular in structure and contain N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, SH2 domain, and a transcriptional activation domain, with each domain engaging in important molecular events for promoting STAT functions. In particular, the SH2 domain mediates crucial interactions with specific pTyr peptide motifs, including promoting the association with receptors and holding up two activated STAT monomers together in a reciprocal SH2 domain:pTyr interactions in STAT:STAT dimerization. Among the STAT family members, Stat3 and Stat5 have been strongly implicated in malignant transformation and tumorigenesis (3Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), there are considerable efforts to design probes that disrupt these interactions for potential application as drugs (9Sawyer T.K.

Chem. 2008; 3: 1159-1168Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Whereas the focus of the existing Stat3 drug discovery efforts have been on disrupting the Stat3 SH2 domain:pTyr peptide interactions for a good reason, the approaches have largely been directed at SH2 domain antagonists, which are pTyr peptide mimics that compete for the binding to the Stat3 SH2 domain (4Yue P. Turkson J. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2009; 18: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5Turkson J. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2004; 8: 409-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 22Fletcher S. Turkson J. Gunning P.T. Chem. Med. Chem. 2008; 3: 1159-1168Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One of the major limitations of this approach has been finding a membrane-permeable, optimum pTyr substitute that retains the high binding affinities of the native pTyr peptide motifs, against which these antagonists will be competing for the binding to the Stat3 SH2 domain. To eliminate this issue, we have taken the converse approach of identifying a suitable Stat3 SH2 domain-mimic. Key structural information from the computational modeling of the native pTyr peptide, PpYLKTK bound to the Stat3 SH2 domain, per the crystal structure of Stat3β (23Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) facilitated the design of a 28-mer peptide, SPI from the Stat3 SH2 domain. Studies presented herein show that SPI retains the binding characteristics of the SH2 domain. In vitro biochemical and biophysical studies indicate SPI, like Stat3 binds to cognate pTyr-peptide motifs with a similar affinity. Accordingly, SPI blocks the binding of Stat3 (or Stat3 SH2 domain) to cognate pTyr peptide motifs, and hence functions as a selective inhibitor of constitutive Stat3 activation in human breast, prostate, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer cells, with antitumor cell effects.DISCUSSIONProtein-protein interactions are a common molecular event important in signal transduction and many other physiological processes. In the case of Stat3, the recruitment via the SH2 domain to cognate receptor pTyr peptide motifs is a key initial step for phosphorylation. Data herein show that the Stat3 SH2 domain-derived 28-mer peptide, SPI alone is sufficient to reproduce some aspects of the biochemical properties of Stat3 (or the Stat3 SH2 domain), thereby serving as a critical motif that engages in the inter-molecular interactions with the key residues of the cognate pTyr peptides to which Stat3 binds. Using biophysical analysis, such as SPR, we demonstrate similarities in the binding characteristics of Stat3 (or Stat3 SH2 domain) and SPI to known cognate pTyr peptides, including the native IL-6R/gp-130 derived peptide, GpYLPQTV-NH2, the Stat3 peptide, pY705Stat3, and the EGFR motif, pY1068EGFR, which Stat3 and SPI interact relatively stronger, and to the EGFR motif, pY1086EGFR and the Stat1 peptide, pY701Stat1, which they bind to with rather low affinities. The similarity in the binding characteristics of SPI and Stat3 is further evident by the SPR analysis that further suggests rather unfavorable interactions with the native Stat5 phosphopeptide, pY694Stat5, with affinities that are in milli-molar concentrations (KD of 1–7 mm). Together, present studies indicate SPI, like Stat3, shows preferential binding to different cognate pTyr peptide motifs, specifically showing stronger binding to the Stat3 phosphopeptide, compared with weaker binding to the Stat1 phosphopeptide. Given the observed differences in the affinities, we surmise that the type and number of binding partners to which Stat3 (or Stat3 SH2 domain) or SPI would interact with would be strongly influenced by their intracellular concentrations. Fluorescence polarization analysis based on the binding to the gp130-derived peptide (as 5-carboxyfluorescein-GpYLPQTV-NH2), (40Chen J. Bai L. Bernard D. Nikolovska-Coleska Z. Gomez C. Zhang J. Yi H. Wang S. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2010; 1: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), further support the similarities in the binding characteristics between SPI and Stat3.The ability to mimic the SH2 domain and interact with pTyr peptide motifs raises the possibility that SPI could compete against Stat3. This assertion is supported by the fluorescence polarization studies that SPI strongly competes against Stat3 for the binding to IL-6R/gp13-derived pTyr peptide probe. Furthermore, evidence is presented that SPI exhibits selectivity at certain concentrations in the inhibition of intracellular Stat3 phosphorylation, DNA-binding and transcriptional activities. The inhibition of intracellular Stat3 activation may be explained in part by the ability to disrupt Stat3:Stat3 dimerization, as has been observed for other Stat3 dimerization inhibitors (13Turkson J.

Thus, while the treatment of cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate alone, increased the levels of activated Stat3 above constitutive levels, due to the blockade of pStat3 turnover by protein phosphatases, the prior exposure of cells to SPI squelched any subsequent orthovanadate-induced accumulation of activated Stat3. Moreover, the observation that SPI exhibits preferential inhibition of Stat3 activation relative to Stat1, despite the physiological occurrence of a Stat1:Stat3 heterodimer, when the two STAT family members are concurrently activated by EGF, suggests not only does SPI have preference for Stat3 over Stat1, but also that activated Stat3 protein may prefer to form a homodimer when concurrently activated with Stat1.The SPI-mediated inhibition of Stat3 activation, via binding to cognate pTyr peptide motifs, is in direct converse to the mechanisms of Stat3 inhibition by many of the existing Stat3-inhibitory modalities, which are pY peptide mimetics and bind to the Stat3 SH2 module (4Yue P.

Anticancer Drugs. 2006; 17: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), although the biochemical outcome of the inhibition would be the same, which is to disrupt pY:SH2 domain interactions. Whereas there are many protein entities with an SH2 module that are involved in promoting signal transduction and other biochemical processes (8Yaffe M.B. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Accordingly, antitumor cell effects of SPI are observed at concentrations that inhibit Stat3 activity and are consistent with the blockade of aberrant Stat3 activation (4Yue P. Turkson J.

Specifically, human breast, pancreatic, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancer cells harboring aberrant Stat3 activity are more sensitive to SPI. We note an increased nuclear accumulation of SPI in malignant cells, which we speculate will promote a stronger degree of inhibition of nuclear activated Stat3 and Stat3 transcriptional activity. By contrast, in mouse fibroblasts overexpressing the EGFR in which Stat3 is not aberrantly-activated, SPI is predominantly localized to the cell membrane. The mechanism(s) for the cellular uptake and the nuclear translocation, and whether there are specific factors that promote the increased nuclear localization in malignant cells remain to be determined. Herein is reported a Stat3 SH2 domain-mimetic that functions as an inhibitor of Stat3 activation. The approach to the inhibition of Stat3 activation by SPI avoids the known challenges of mimicking the pTyr functionality for the existing SH2 domain-binding inhibitors. The significant in vitro activity of SPI makes it a suitable candidate for developing a modality for further evaluation of in vivo effects. Furthermore, SPI serves as a valuable molecular probe for interrogating aberrant Stat3 functions in tumor processes and for designing in vitro pY peptide binding assays. IntroductionThe binding of cytokines or growth factors to cognate receptors initiates a cascade of molecular events that culminate in the activation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) family of proteins (1Bromberg J. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Among these is the recruitment of STATs, via the SH2 domain, to the receptor phosphotyrosine (pTyr) 2The abbreviations used are: pTyr or pYphosphorylated tyrosineSH2Src homology 2EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorErkMAPKextracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinaseGOLDgenetic optimization for ligand dockingSPRsurface plasmon resonanceFPfluorescence polarization. peptide motifs, which brings them into close proximity for phosphorylation on a key tyrosyl residue by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, Janus kinases (Jaks), and the Src family kinases. Consequently, dimerization between two STAT monomers is promoted through a reciprocal pTyr-SH2 domain interaction, and the active STAT dimers in the nucleus bind to specific DNA-response elements in the promoters of target genes and regulate gene expression. In response to growth factors and cytokines, normal STAT signaling promotes cell growth and differentiation, development, inflammation, and immune responses.The STAT proteins are modular in structure and contain N-terminal domain, coiled-coil domain, DNA-binding domain, SH2 domain, and a transcriptional activation domain, with each domain engaging in important molecular events for promoting STAT functions. In particular, the SH2 domain mediates crucial interactions with specific pTyr peptide motifs, including promoting the association with receptors and holding up two activated STAT monomers together in a reciprocal SH2 domain:pTyr interactions in STAT:STAT dimerization. Among the STAT family members, Stat3 and Stat5 have been strongly implicated in malignant transformation and tumorigenesis (3Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev.

In general, given the role of the SH2 domain as an important motif in signal transduction, in relation to engaging in interactions with pTyr peptide modules (8Yaffe M.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), there are considerable efforts to design probes that disrupt these interactions for potential application as drugs (9Sawyer T.K.

Turkson J. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2009; 18: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 5Turkson J. Expert Opin. Ther.

One of the major limitations of this approach has been finding a membrane-permeable, optimum pTyr substitute that retains the high binding affinities of the native pTyr peptide motifs, against which these antagonists will be competing for the binding to the Stat3 SH2 domain. To eliminate this issue, we have taken the converse approach of identifying a suitable Stat3 SH2 domain-mimic. Key structural information from the computational modeling of the native pTyr peptide, PpYLKTK bound to the Stat3 SH2 domain, per the crystal structure of Stat3β (23Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) facilitated the design of a 28-mer peptide, SPI from the Stat3 SH2 domain. Studies presented herein show that SPI retains the binding characteristics of the SH2 domain. In vitro biochemical and biophysical studies indicate SPI, like Stat3 binds to cognate pTyr-peptide motifs with a similar affinity. Accordingly, SPI blocks the binding of Stat3 (or Stat3 SH2 domain) to cognate pTyr peptide motifs, and hence functions as a selective inhibitor of constitutive Stat3 activation in human breast, prostate, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer cells, with antitumor cell effects."

We previously demonstrated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for synaptic AMPA receptor delivery in an in vitro model of eyeblink classical conditioning. Here, we report that acquisition of conditioned responses was significantly attenuated by bath application of oligomeric (200 nm), but not fibrillar, Aβ peptide. Western blotting revealed that BDNF protein expression during conditioning is significantly reduced by treatment with oligomeric Aβ, as were phosphorylation levels of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), and ERK. However, levels of PKA and PKCζ/λ were unaffected, as was PDK-1. Protein localization studies using confocal imaging indicate that oligomeric Aβ, but not fibrillar or scrambled forms, suppresses colocalization of GluR1 and GluR4 AMPA receptor subunits with synaptophysin, indicating that trafficking of these subunits to synapses during the conditioning procedure is blocked. In contrast, coapplication of BDNF with oligomeric Aβ significantly reversed these findings. Interestingly, a tolloid-like metalloproteinase in turtle, tTLLs (turtle tolloid-like protein), which normally processes the precursor proBDNF into mature BDNF, was found to degrade oligomeric Aβ into small fragments. These data suggest that an Aβ-induced reduction in BDNF, perhaps due to interference in the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF to BDNF, results in inhibition of synaptic AMPA receptor delivery and suppression of the acquisition of conditioning.

https://openalex.org/W2091082924,"We identified that activation of the G(q)-linked dopamine D1-D2 receptor hetero-oligomer generates a PLC-dependent intracellular calcium signal. Confocal FRET between endogenous dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in striatal neurons confirmed a physical interaction between them. Pretreatment with SKF 83959, which selectively activates the D1-D2 receptor heteromer, or SKF 83822, which only activates the D1 receptor homo-oligomer, led to rapid desensitization of the D1-D2 receptor heteromer-mediated calcium signal in both heterologous cells and striatal neurons. This desensitization response was mediated through selective occupancy of the D1 receptor binding pocket. Although SKF 83822 was unable to activate the D1-D2 receptor heteromer, it still permitted desensitization of the calcium signal. This suggested that occupancy of the D1 receptor binding pocket by SKF 83822 resulted in conformational changes sufficient for desensitization without heteromer activation. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated an agonist-induced physical association between the D1-D2 receptor heteromeric complex and GRK2. Increased expression of GRK2 led to a decrease in the calcium signal with or without prior exposure to either SKF 83959 or SKF 83822. GRK2 knockdown by siRNA led to an increase in the signal after pretreatment with either agonist. Expression of the catalytically inactive and RGS (regulator of G protein signaling)-mutated GRK2 constructs each led to a partial recovery of the GRK2-attenuated calcium signal. These results indicated that desensitization of the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer-mediated signal can occur by agonist occupancy even without activation and is dually regulated by both the catalytic and RGS domains of GRK2."
https://openalex.org/W1999062823,"Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) were originally designed to affect the nervous system by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, an important regulator of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Over the past years evidence is mounting that these compounds affect many other processes. Little is known, however, about gene expression responses against OPs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This is surprising because C. elegans is extensively used as a model species in toxicity studies. To address this question we performed a microarray study in C. elegans which was exposed for 72 hrs to two widely used Ops, chlorpyrifos and diazinon, and a low dose mixture of these two compounds. Our analysis revealed transcriptional responses related to detoxification, stress, innate immunity, and transport and metabolism of lipids in all treatments. We found that for both compounds as well as in the mixture, these processes were regulated by different gene transcripts. Our results illustrate intense, and unexpected crosstalk between gene pathways in response to chlorpyrifos and diazinon in C. elegans."

In these enzymes, the NADP(H) cofactor is essential for stabilizing the flavin intermediate, which activates dioxygen and makes it ready to react with the substrate undergoing oxygenation. Our studies combine site-directed mutagenesis with the usage of NADP+ analogues to dissect the specific roles of the cofactors and surrounding protein matrix. The highlight of this “double-engineering” approach is that subtle alterations in the hydrogen bonding and stereochemical environment can drastically alter the efficiency and outcome of the reaction with oxygen.

These data rationalize the effect of mutations that cause enzyme deficiency in patients affected by the fish odor syndrome.

They are involved in diverse biological processes such as the biosynthesis of various natural products (4Schlaich N.L. Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12: 412-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and catabolism of xenobiotics. Humans have five different isozymes that are coded by different genes and represent a key enzymatic system in drug metabolism, whose relevance almost equals that of cytochrome P450s. Among known FMO substrates, there are metabolites directly or indirectly deriving from food digestion such as trimethylamine, drugs such as tamoxifen, and toxic molecules such as nicotine. Mutations in the gene for the isozyme 3 of human FMO (FMO3), which is most abundant in the liver, are directly responsible for trimethylaminuria, also known as fish odor syndrome (TMAU). This genetic disease causes the accumulation of trimethylamine so that the body of the patients tend to have an unpleasant smell (5Al-Waiz M. Ayesh R. Mitchell S.C. Idle J.R. Smith R.L. Lancet. 1987; 1: 634-635Abstract PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Dolphin C.T. Janmohamed A. Smith R.L. Shephard E.A. Phillips I.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Irrespectively of their biological context, FMOs always catalyze the same reaction: the oxygenation of a soft nucleophile using molecular oxygen as oxygen source and NADPH as electron donor (7Ziegler D.M. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). At the heart of this very complex reaction is the stabilization of the flavin-hydroperoxide adduct resulting from the reaction of dioxygen with the two-electron reduced FAD (Fig. 1A). Equally essential is the role of NADP(H). This cofactor not only acts as the electron donor that reduces the flavin but it directly takes part also in formation/stabilization of the flavin-hydroperoxide. This notion is best illustrated by the fact that using alternative electron donors (e.g. dithionite) in place of NADPH does not support catalysis because the reaction of dioxygen with the artificially reduced flavin generates hydrogen peroxide rather than the stable flavin-hydroperoxide needed for monooxygenation (8Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3817-3819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol.

In the cellular milieu, FMOs are thought to be mainly in the flavin-hydroperoxide state, ready to attack a suitable substrate (the so-called “cocked gun”) (11Poulsen L.L. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6449-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The peculiar catalytic role of NADP(H) in oxygenation makes FMOs a very attractive system to study the more general problem of oxygen reactivity in flavoenzymes. Because it has been established that the nicotinamide cofactor remains bound to enzyme during oxygenation, NADP(H) can be exploited as a probe to gain insight into the reaction of dioxygen with the reduced flavin and to interrogate the elements that promote the stabilization of the crucial flavin-hydroperoxide. This concept represents the starting point of our study that builds on the previous analysis of the crystal structure and basic biochemical properties of the FMO from Methylophaga sp. strain SK1 (mFMO, Fig. 1B) (12Choi H.S.

This bacterial enzyme shares many features with the human FMO3 including a considerable degree of sequence identity (33%), a similar substrate specificity, and the ability to form a stable flavin-hydroperoxide intermediate (13Alfieri A. Malito E. Orru R. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 195: 6572-6577Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). At the same time, mFMO is better suited for detailed structural and enzymological investigations because it is a soluble protein (i.e. not membrane-associated). The aim of our study is 2-fold: (i) to gain insight into the astonishing properties of FMOs that combine in a single active center two cofactors and a complex sequence of catalytic steps that lead to the formation of an “activated-form” of dioxygen (flavin-hydroperoxide, Fig. 1A), and (ii) to translate this knowledge into a molecular rational for the effects of mutations found in patients affected by TMAU. For these purposes, we have probed the mFMO catalytic properties by altering both the active site amino acids by site directed mutagenesis and the NADP(H) substrate by using analogues of this cofactor. Such a “double-engineering” strategy has revealed that very fine details in the stereochemical and hydrogen-bonding environment around the flavin determine the efficiency of the reaction with dioxygen and the nature of the resulting products.DISCUSSIONThe specific objective of our study was to investigate the reaction of FMO with dioxygen using site-directed mutagenesis and NADP(H) analogues as dissecting tools. The general aim was to improve our knowledge of the molecular basis of TMAU and to advance our current understanding of the oxygen reactivity in flavoenzymes. Along these lines, we can draw several conclusions.The analysis of the Asn-78 mutants indicates that at least some of the TMAU-causing mutations target the Achilles heel of the enzyme: the intrinsic “fragility” of the crucial flavin-hydroperoxide intermediate, which, if not appropriately stabilized, causes the conversion of the enzyme into an oxidase.In this scenario, the fact that the devil is in the detail is best illustrated by the N78S variant (Figs. 2A and 3A). This mutation does not affect the steric hindrance and hydrophilic nature of the side chain and does not cause any detectable change in the active site conformation. Nevertheless, it fully inactivates the enzyme. Evidently, the fine details in the environment of the C4a atom (Fig. 1A) can make a tremendous difference in the flavin reactivity. In this case, it appears that a Ser side chain in position 78 is unable to provide the precisely positioned H-bond partner required to stabilize the flavin-hydroperoxide, whose terminal oxygen can accept and donate H-bonds (Figs. 1A and 3A). Therefore, the intermediate does not form at all or, more likely, it decays too rapidly to sustain monooxygenation (Fig. 2B). As a result, the mutant enzyme retains (albeit less efficient) reactivity with oxygen but only to function as oxidase and not as monooxygenase (Table 1).The N78D mutant illustrates the role of electrostatics. This isosteric mutation positions a negative charge close to the N5 with to a 30-fold reduction in the kox (Table 1). As observed for other flavoenzymes, it is likely that this mutation disfavors the first step of the oxygen reaction; the one-electron transfer leading to the formation of flavin semiquinone-superoxide caged radical pair that subsequently generates the flavin-hydroperoxide and/or hydrogen peroxide (24Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22459-22462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Monooxygenation requires that NADP+ binds in the proper conformation as outlined by the study of the N78D mutant and the experiments with the APADP+ analog (Figs. 3B and 4B). The role of NADP+ is manifold: (i) together with Asn-78, it creates the niche for oxygen binding in front of the flavin C4a atom, (ii) its ribose 2′-hydroxyl group provides a potential H-bonding partner for the flavin-hydroperoxide atoms (13Alfieri A. Malito E. Orru R. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 195: 6572-6577Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and (iii) it forms key H-bond interactions with the flavin N5 and O4 atoms (Fig. 1B). This latter feature should be emphasized because it can have a crucial role. It is known that protection of the flavin N5 atom can enormously enhance the stability of the flavin-hydroperoxide to the point that the reaction of oxygen with protein-free reduced N5-alkylriboflavin forms a very stable and biocatalytically useful hydroperoxide derivative (26Kemal C. Chan T.W. Bruice R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 7272-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 27Imada Y. Iida H. Murahashi S. Naota T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2005; 44: 1704-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Although the N5 atom of the two-electron reduced flavin has a very high pKa value (around 20) (28Macheroux P. Ghisla S. Sanner C. Rüterjans H. Müller F. BMC Biochem. 2005; 6: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), adequate protection of this atom is probably needed to inhibit rapid proton exchange with the solvent which may concomitantly trigger decay of the flavin-hydroperoxide. Likewise, protection of the N5 may also prevent that this atom directly takes part in the oxygen reaction for example by acting as hydrogen or proton donor.The comparison of the NADP+ and APADP+ complexes (Fig. 4C) provides a glimpse of the likely mode of binding of the organic substrate. Indeed, as visualized by Fig. 4C, the “out” position of the APADP+ pyridine moiety corresponds to the location expected for an organic substrate (for example indole or nicotine) to be monooxygenated by the enzyme. The substrate promiscuity of FMOs, which act on a variety of diverse molecules, seems to inevitably expose these enzymes to the risk of binding the pyridine ring of the NADP(H) ligand in the catalytically incorrect positions as indicated by the mutagenesis and NADP-analog studies. In this context, it is remarkable that the mFMO appears to use a Tyr residue as a backdoor that sandwiches the nicotinamide in the H-bonding position with N5 (Fig. 3C).The more general conclusion from this analysis is that the two alternative pathways (oxidation versus monooxygenation) along the oxygen reaction can be predicted to have very similar energy barriers so that subtle alterations in the balance of interactions around the C4a-N5 atoms of the flavin can drastically alter the outcome of the reaction of the reduced enzyme with dioxygen. This will be a crucial aspect to be considered in the design and development of FMOs and related monooxygenases for biocatalytic application. IntroductionFlavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) 3The abbreviations used are: FMOflavin-containing monooxygenaseFMO3isozyme 3 of human FMOAPADP3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotidemFMOFMO from Methylophaga sp. strain SK1TMAUtrimethylaminuria. form a large family of enzymes present almost ubiquitously among living organisms (1Cashman J.R.

Sci. 2008; 29: 294-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They are involved in diverse biological processes such as the biosynthesis of various natural products (4Schlaich N.L. Trends Plant Sci. 2007; 12: 412-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and catabolism of xenobiotics. Humans have five different isozymes that are coded by different genes and represent a key enzymatic system in drug metabolism, whose relevance almost equals that of cytochrome P450s. Among known FMO substrates, there are metabolites directly or indirectly deriving from food digestion such as trimethylamine, drugs such as tamoxifen, and toxic molecules such as nicotine. Mutations in the gene for the isozyme 3 of human FMO (FMO3), which is most abundant in the liver, are directly responsible for trimethylaminuria, also known as fish odor syndrome (TMAU). This genetic disease causes the accumulation of trimethylamine so that the body of the patients tend to have an unpleasant smell (5Al-Waiz M. Ayesh R. Mitchell S.C. Idle J.R. Smith R.L. Lancet. 1987; 1: 634-635Abstract PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Dolphin C.T. Janmohamed A. Smith R.L. Shephard E.A. Phillips I.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).Irrespectively of their biological context, FMOs always catalyze the same reaction: the oxygenation of a soft nucleophile using molecular oxygen as oxygen source and NADPH as electron donor (7Ziegler D.M. Drug Metab. Rev. 2002; 34: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). At the heart of this very complex reaction is the stabilization of the flavin-hydroperoxide adduct resulting from the reaction of dioxygen with the two-electron reduced FAD (Fig. 1A). Equally essential is the role of NADP(H). This cofactor not only acts as the electron donor that reduces the flavin but it directly takes part also in formation/stabilization of the flavin-hydroperoxide. This notion is best illustrated by the fact that using alternative electron donors (e.g. dithionite) in place of NADPH does not support catalysis because the reaction of dioxygen with the artificially reduced flavin generates hydrogen peroxide rather than the stable flavin-hydroperoxide needed for monooxygenation (8Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3817-3819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Beaty N.B. Ballou D.P. J. Biol.

In the cellular milieu, FMOs are thought to be mainly in the flavin-hydroperoxide state, ready to attack a suitable substrate (the so-called “cocked gun”) (11Poulsen L.L. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6449-6455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The peculiar catalytic role of NADP(H) in oxygenation makes FMOs a very attractive system to study the more general problem of oxygen reactivity in flavoenzymes. Because it has been established that the nicotinamide cofactor remains bound to enzyme during oxygenation, NADP(H) can be exploited as a probe to gain insight into the reaction of dioxygen with the reduced flavin and to interrogate the elements that promote the stabilization of the crucial flavin-hydroperoxide. This concept represents the starting point of our study that builds on the previous analysis of the crystal structure and basic biochemical properties of the FMO from Methylophaga sp. strain SK1 (mFMO, Fig. 1B) (12Choi H.S.

https://openalex.org/W1995541814,"The insulin-like family of factors are involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes, but the function of the family member termed insulin-like 6 (Insl6) in skeletal muscle has not been reported. We show that Insl6 is a myokine that is up-regulated in skeletal muscle downstream of Akt signaling and in regenerating muscle in response to cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced injury. In the CTX injury model, myofiber regeneration was improved by the intramuscular or systemic delivery of an adenovirus expressing Insl6. Skeletal muscle-specific Insl6 transgenic mice exhibited normal muscle mass under basal conditions but elevated satellite cell activation and enhanced muscle regeneration in response to CTX injury. The Insl6-mediated regenerative response was associated with reductions in muscle cell apoptosis and reduced serum levels of creatine kinase M. Overexpression of Insl6 stimulated proliferation and reduced apoptosis in cultured myogenic cells. Conversely, knockdown of Insl6 reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. These data indicate that Insl6 is an injury-regulated myokine that functions as a myogenic regenerative factor."
https://openalex.org/W2055493976,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is one of the most abundantly expressed serine/threonine protein phosphatases. A large body of evidence suggests that PP2A is a tumor suppressor and plays critical roles in regulating apoptosis. PP2A is a heterotrimeric protein complex. Its substrate specificity, localization, and activity are regulated by regulatory subunits of PP2A. A recent study has demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphism in B56ε (PPP2R5E), a B56 family regulatory subunit of PP2A, is associated with human soft tissue sarcoma. This raises the possibility that B56ε is involved in tumorigenesis and plays important roles in regulating apoptosis. However, this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Our previous studies revealed that B56ε regulates a number of developmental signaling pathways during early embryonic patterning. Here we report novel functions of B56ε in regulating apoptosis. We provide evidence that B56ε has both anti- and pro-apoptotic functions. B56ε suppresses p53-independent apoptosis during neural development, but triggers p53-dependent apoptosis. Mechanistically, B56ε regulates the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway solely through controlling the stability of p53 protein. In addition to its function in regulating apoptosis, we show that B56ε undergoes proteolytic cleavage. The cleavage of B56ε is mediated by caspase-3 and occurs on the carboxyl side of an evolutionarily conserved N-terminal ""DKXD"" motif. These results demonstrate that B56ε, a substrate of caspase-3, is an essential regulator of apoptosis. So far, we have identified an alternative translation isoform and a caspase cleavage product of B56ε. The significance of post-transcriptional regulation of B56ε is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2024638894,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are extensively involved in diverse biological processes. However, very little is known about the role of miRNAs in mediating the action of thyroid hormones (TH). Appropriate TH levels are known to be critically important for development, differentiation and maintenance of metabolic balance in mammals. We induced transient hypothyroidism in juvenile mice by short-term exposure to methimazole and perchlorate from post natal day (PND) 12 to 15. The expression of miRNAs in the liver was analyzed using Taqman Low Density Arrays (containing up to 600 rodent miRNAs). We found the expression of 40 miRNAs was significantly altered in the livers of hypothyroid mice compared to euthyroid controls. Among the miRNAs, miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b exhibited a massive increase in expression (50- to 500-fold). The regulation of TH on the expression of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b was confirmed in various mouse models including: chronic hypothyroid, short-term hyperthyroid and short-term hypothyroid followed by TH supplementation. TH regulation of these miRNAs was also confirmed in mouse hepatocyte AML 12 cells. The expression of precursors of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b were examined in AML 12 cells and shown to decrease after TH treatment, only pre-mir-206 and pre-mir-133b reached statistical significance. To identify the targets of these miRNAs, DNA microarrays were used to examine hepatic mRNA levels in the short-term hypothyroid mouse model relative to controls. We found transcripts from 92 known genes were significantly altered in these hypothyroid mice. Web-based target predication software (TargetScan and Microcosm) identified 14 of these transcripts as targets of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b. The vast majority of these mRNA targets were significantly down-regulated in hypothyroid mice, corresponding with the up-regulation of miRs-1, 206, 133a and 133b in hypothyroid mouse liver. To further investigate target genes, miR-206 was over-expressed in AML 12 cells. TH treatment of cells over-expressing miR-206 resulted in decreased miR-206 expression, and a significant increase in two predicted target genes, Mup1 and Gpd2. The results suggest that TH regulation of these genes may occur secondarily via miR-206. These studies provide new insight into the role of miRNAs in mediating TH regulation of gene expression."

If CcO assembly is prevented, the level of Mss51 available for translational activation is reduced. We deleted the C-terminal 11 or 15 residues of Cox1 by site-directed mutagenesis of mtDNA.

We surveyed a panel of mutations that block CcO assembly for the strength of their effect on Cox1 synthesis, both by pulse labeling and expression of the ARG8m reporter fused to COX1. Deletion of the nuclear gene encoding Cox6, one of the first subunits to be added to assembling CcO, caused the most severe reduction in Cox1 synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2070984758,"Death receptor 5 (DR5) and caspase-8 are major components in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The alterations of the expression of these proteins during the metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and their prognostic impact have not been reported. The present study analyzes the expression of DR5 and caspase-8 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in primary and metastatic HNSCCs and their impact on patient survival. Tumor samples in this study included 100 primary HNSCC with no evidence of metastasis, 100 primary HNSCC with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and 100 matching LNM. IHC analysis revealed a significant loss or downregulation of DR5 expression in primary tumors with metastasis and their matching LNM compared to primary tumors with no evidence of metastasis. A similar trend was observed in caspase-8 expression although it was not statistically significant. Downregulation of caspase-8 and DR5 expression was significantly correlated with poorly differentiated tumors compared to moderately and well differentiated tumors. Univariate analysis indicates that, in HNSCC with no metastasis, higher expression of caspase-8 significantly correlated with better disease-free survival and overall survival. However, in HNSCC with LNM, higher caspase-8 expression significantly correlated with poorer disease-free survival and overall survival. Similar results were also generated when we combined both DR5 and caspase-8. Taken together, we suggest that both DR5 and caspase-8 are involved in regulation of HNSCC metastasis. Our findings warrant further investigation on the dual role of caspase-8 in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2086513116,"Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) augments after environmental enrichment (EE) and it has been related to some of the anxiolytic, antidepressant and neuroprotective effects of EE. Indeed, it has been suggested that EE specifically modulates hippocampal neurogenic cell populations over the course of time. Here we have used dual-birthdating to study two subpopulations of newborn neuron in mice (Mus musculus): those born at the beginning and at the end of enrichment. In this way, we demonstrate that while short-term cell survival is upregulated after an initial 1 week period of enrichment in 2 month old female mice, after long-term enrichment (2 months) neither cell proliferation nor the survival of the younger newly born cell populations are distinguishable from that observed in non-enriched control mice. In addition, we show that the survival of older newborn neurons alone (i.e. those born at the beginning of the enrichment) is higher than in controls, due to the significantly lower levels of cell death. Indeed, these parameters are rapidly adjusted to the sudden cessation of the EE conditions. These findings suggest both an early selective, long-lasting effect of EE on the neurons born in the initial stages of enrichment, and a quick response when the environment again becomes impoverished. Therefore, EE induces differential effects on distinct subpopulations of newborn neurons depending on the age of the immature cells and on the duration of the EE itself. The interaction of these two parameters constitutes a new, specific regulation of these neurogenic populations that might account for the long-term enrichment's behavioral effects."
https://openalex.org/W2072755267,"The initiation of behavioral sensitization to cocaine and other psychomotor stimulants is thought to reflect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated synaptic plasticity in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) circuitry. The importance of drug induced NMDAR mediated adaptations in ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons, and its association with drug seeking behaviors, has recently been evaluated in Cre-loxp mice lacking functional NMDARs in DA neurons expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous dopamine transporter gene (NR1(DATCre) mice).Using an additional NR1(DATCre) mouse transgenic model, we demonstrate that while the selective inactivation of NMDARs in DA neurons eliminates the induction of molecular changes leading to synaptic strengthening, behavioral measures such as cocaine induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference remain intact in NR1(DATCre) mice. Since VTA DA neurons projecting to the prefrontal cortex and amygdala express little or no detectable levels of the dopamine transporter, it has been speculated that NMDA receptors in DA neurons projecting to these brain areas may have been spared in NR1(DATCre) mice. Here we demonstrate that the NMDA receptor gene is ablated in the majority of VTA DA neurons, including those exhibiting undetectable DAT expression levels in our NR1(DATCre) transgenic model, and that application of an NMDAR antagonist within the VTA of NR1(DATCre) animals still blocks sensitization to cocaine.These results eliminate the possibility of NMDAR mediated neuroplasticity in the different DA neuronal subpopulations in our NR1(DATCre) mouse model and therefore suggest that NMDARs on non-DA neurons within the VTA must play a major role in cocaine-related addictive behavior."

Profound depletion of extracellular calcium is well known to cause loosening of the tight junction with loss of transepithelial resistance. However, moderate variations in calcium concentrations within the physiological range can also regulate transepithelial permeability. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we studied the effects of calcium on the permeability of claudin-2, expressed in an inducible MDCK I cell line. We found that in the physiological range, calcium acts as a reversible inhibitor of the total conductance and Na+ permeability of claudin-2, without causing changes in tight junction structure. The effect of calcium is enhanced at low Na+ concentrations, consistent with a competitive effect. Furthermore, mutation of an intrapore negatively charged binding site, Asp-65, to asparagine partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of calcium. This suggests that calcium competes with Na+ for binding to Asp-65. Other polyvalent cations had similar effects, including La3+, which caused severe and irreversible inhibition of conductance. Brownian dynamics simulations demonstrated that such inhibition can be explained if Asp-65 has a relatively high charge density, thus favoring binding of Ca2+ over that of Na+, reducing Ca2+ permeation by inhibiting its dissociation from this site, and decreasing Na+ conductance through repulsive electrostatic interaction with Ca2+. These findings may explain why hypercalcemia inhibits Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. Claudins form paracellular pores at the tight junction in epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2089503508,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant health burden world-wide, although vaccines help decrease this problem. We previously identified associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms in several candidate genes with vaccine-induced peak antibody level (anti-HBs), which is predictive of long-term vaccine efficacy and protection against infection and persistent carriage; here we report on a haplotype-based analysis. A total of 688 SNPs from 117 genes were examined for a two, three and four sliding window haplotype analysis in a Gambian cohort. Analysis was performed on 197 unrelated individuals, 454 individuals from 174 families, and the combined sample (N = 651). Global and individual haplotype association tests were carried out (adjusted for covariates), employing peak anti-HBs level as outcome. Five genes (CD44, CD58, CDC42, IL19 and IL1R1) had at least one significant haplotype in the unrelated or family analysis as well as the combined analysis. Previous single locus results were confirmed for CD44 (combined global p = 9.1x10(-5) for rs353644-rs353630-rs7937602) and CD58 (combined global p = 0.008 for rs1414275-rs11588376-rs1016140). Haplotypes in CDC42, IL19 and IL1R1 also associated with peak anti-HBs level. We have identified strong haplotype effects on HBV vaccine-induced antibody level in five genes, three of which, CDC42, IL19 and IL1R1, did not show evidence of association in a single SNP analyses and corroborated the majority of these effects in two datasets. The haplotype analysis identified associations with HBV vaccine-induced immunity in several new genes."
https://openalex.org/W2048820770,"Background Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role in cellular senescence as key transcriptional regulators of the Ink4a/Arf tumor suppressor gene locus. However, how PcG complexes target and contribute to stable gene silencing of the Ink4a/Arf locus remains little understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined the function of Zinc finger domain-containing protein 277 (Zfp277), a novel zinc finger protein that interacts with the PcG protein Bmi1. Zfp277 binds to the Ink4a/Arf locus in a Bmi1-independent manner and interacts with polycomb repressor complex (PRC) 1 through direct interaction with Bmi1. Loss of Zfp277 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) caused dissociation of PcG proteins from the Ink4a/Arf locus, resulting in premature senescence associated with derepressed p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression. Levels of both Zfp277 and PcG proteins inversely correlated with those of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in senescing MEFs, but the treatment of Zfp277−/− MEFs with an antioxidant restored the binding of PRC2 but not PRC1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus. Notably, forced expression of Bmi1 in Zfp277−/− MEFs did not restore the binding of Bmi1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus and failed to bypass cellular senescence. A Zfp277 mutant that could not bind Bmi1 did not rescue Zfp277−/− MEFs from premature senescence. Conclusions/Significance Our findings implicate Zfp277 in the transcriptional regulation of the Ink4a/Arf locus and suggest that the interaction of Zfp277 with Bmi1 is essential for the recruitment of PRC1 to the Ink4a/Arf locus. Our findings also highlight dynamic regulation of both Zfp277 and PcG proteins by the oxidative stress pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2084468230,"Background Transcriptome diversity provides the key to cellular identity. One important contribution to expression diversity is the use of alternative promoters, which creates mRNA isoforms by expanding the choice of transcription initiation sites of a gene. The proximity of the basal promoter to the transcription initiation site enables prediction of a promoter's location based on the gene annotations. We show that annotation of alternative promoters regulating expression of transcripts with distinct first exons enables a novel methodology to quantify expression levels and tissue specificity of mRNA isoforms. Principal Findings The use of distinct alternative first exons in 3,296 genes was examined using exon-microarray data from 11 human tissues. Comparing two transcripts from each gene we found that the activity of alternative promoters (i.e., P1 and P2) was not correlated through tissue specificity or level of expression. Furthermore neither P1 nor P2 conferred any bias for tissue-specific or ubiquitous expression. Genes associated with specific diseases produced transcripts whose limited expression patterns were consistent with the tissue affected in disease. Notably, genes that were historically designated as tissue-specific or housekeeping had alternative isoforms that showed differential expression. Furthermore, only a small number of alternative promoters showed expression exclusive to a single tissue indicating that “tissue preference” provides a better description of promoter activity than tissue specificity. When compared to gene expression data in public databases, as few as 22% of the genes had detailed information for more than one isoform, whereas the remainder collapsed the expression patterns from individual transcripts into one profile. Conclusions We describe a computational pipeline that uses microarray data to assess the level of expression and breadth of tissue profiles for transcripts with distinct first exons regulated by alternative promoters. We conclude that alternative promoters provide individualized regulation that is confirmed through expression levels, tissue preference and chromatin modifications. Although the selective use of alternative promoters often goes uncharacterized in gene expression analyses, transcripts produced in this manner make unique contributions to the cell that requires further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2089501357,"Accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) into brain parenchymal plaques and the cerebral vasculature is a pathological feature of Alzheimer disease and related disorders. Aβ peptides readily form β-sheet-containing oligomers and fibrils. Previously, we reported a strong interaction between myelin basic protein (MBP) and Aβ peptides that resulted in potent inhibition of fibril assembly (Hoos, M. D., Ahmed, M., Smith, S. O., and Van Nostrand, W. E. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 9952-9961; Hoos, M. D., Ahmed, M., Smith, S. O., and Van Nostrand, W. E. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 4720-4727). MBP is recognized as a highly post-translationally modified protein. In the present study, we demonstrate that human MBP purified from either brain or a bacterial recombinant expression system comparably bound to Aβ and inhibited Aβ fibril assembly indicating that post-translational modifications are not required for this activity. We also show that purified mouse brain MBP and recombinantly expressed mouse MBP similarly inhibited Aβ fibril formation. Through a combination of biochemical and ultrastructural techniques, we demonstrate that the binding site for Aβ is located in the N-terminal 64 amino acids of MBP and that a stable peptide (MBP1) comprising these residues was sufficient to inhibit Aβ fibrillogenesis. Under conditions comparable with those used for Aβ, the fibrillar assembly of amylin, another amyloidogenic peptide, was not inhibited by MBP1, although MBP1 still bound to it. This observation suggests that the potent inhibitory effect of MBP on fibril formation is not general to amyloidogenic peptides. Finally, MBP1 could prevent the cytotoxic effects of Aβ in primary cortical neurons. Our findings suggest that inhibition of Aβ fibril assembly by MBP, mediated through its N-terminal domain, could play a role in influencing amyloid formation in Alzheimer disease brain and corresponding mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W1968502545,"Drosophila melanogaster has recently emerged as a useful model system in which to study the genetic basis of regulation of fat storage. One of the most frequently used methods for evaluating the levels of stored fat (triglycerides) in flies is a coupled colorimetric assay available as a kit from several manufacturers. This is an aqueous-based enzymatic assay that is normally used for measurement of mammalian serum triglycerides, which are present in soluble lipoprotein complexes. In this short communication, we show that coupled colorimetric assay kits cannot accurately measure stored triglycerides in Drosophila. First, they fail to give accurate readings when tested on insoluble triglyceride mixtures with compositions like that of stored fat, or on fat extracted from flies with organic solvents. This is probably due to an inability of the lipase used in the kits to efficiently cleave off the glycerol head group from fat molecules in insoluble samples. Second, the measured final products of the kits are quinoneimines, which absorb visible light in the same wavelength range as Drosophila eye pigments. Thus, when extracts from crushed flies are assayed, much of the measured signal is actually due to eye pigments. Finally, the lipoprotein lipases used in colorimetric assays also cleave non-fat glycerides. The glycerol backbones liberated from all classes of glycerides are measured through the remaining reactions in the assay. As a consequence, when these assay kits are used to evaluate tissue extracts, the observed signal actually represents the amount of free glycerols together with all types of glycerides. For these reasons, findings obtained through use of coupled colorimetric assays on Drosophila samples must be interpreted with caution. We also show here that using thin-layer chromatography to measure stored triglycerides in flies eliminates all of these problems."
https://openalex.org/W2152852766,"The recently discovered heliobacteria are the only Gram-positive photosynthetic bacteria that have been cultured. One of the unique features of heliobacteria is that they have properties of both the photosynthetic green sulfur bacteria (containing the type I reaction center) and Clostridia (forming heat-resistant endospores). Most of the previous studies of heliobacteria, which are strict anaerobes and have the simplest known photosynthetic apparatus, have focused on energy and electron transfer processes. It has been assumed that like green sulfur bacteria, the major carbon flow in heliobacteria is through the (incomplete) reductive (reverse) tricarboxylic acid cycle, whereas the lack of CO(2)-enhanced growth has not been understood. Here, we report studies to fill the knowledge gap of heliobacterial carbon metabolism. We confirm that the CO(2)-anaplerotic pathway is active during phototrophic growth and that isoleucine is mainly synthesized from the citramalate pathway. Furthermore, to our surprise, our results suggest that the oxidative (forward) TCA cycle is operative and more active than the previously reported reductive (reverse) tricarboxylic acid cycle. Both isotopomer analysis and activity assays suggest that citrate is produced by a putative (Re)-citrate synthase and then enters the oxidative (forward) TCA cycle. Moreover, in contrast to (Si)-citrate synthase, (Re)-citrate synthase produces a different isomer of 2-fluorocitrate that is not expected to inhibit the activity of aconitase."
https://openalex.org/W1993321535,"Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels arise from existing ones by the budding out of endothelial cell capillaries from the luminal side of blood vessels. Blood vessel formation is essential for organ development during embryogenesis and is associated with several physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing and tumor development. The VE-statin/egfl7 gene is specifically expressed in endothelial cells during embryonic development and in the adult. We studied here the regulatory mechanisms that control this tissue-specific expression. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the specificity of expression of VE-statin/egfl7 in endothelial cells is not shared with its closest neighbor genes notch1 and agpat2 on the mouse chromosome 2. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis of histone modifications at the VE-statin/egfl7 locus showed that the chromatin is specifically opened in endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts at the transcription start sites. A 13 kb genomic fragment of promoter was cloned and analyzed by gene reporter assays which showed that two conserved regions are important for the specific expression of VE-statin/egfl7 in endothelial cells; a -8409/-7563 enhancer and the -252/+38 region encompassing the exon-1b transcription start site. The latter contains essential GATA and ETS-binding sites, as assessed by linker-scanning analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. An analysis of expression of the ETS and GATA transcription factors showed that Erg, Fli-1 and GATA-2 are the most highly expressed factors in endothelial cells. Erg and GATA-2 directly control the expression of the endogenous VE-statin/egfl7 while Fli-1 probably exerts an indirect control, as assessed by RNA interference and chromatin immunoprecipitation. This first detailed analysis of the mechanisms that govern the expression of the VE-statin/egfl7 gene in endothelial cells pinpoints the specific importance of ETS and GATA factors in the specific regulation of genes in this cell lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2015853073,"Mucin type O-glycosylation is a highly conserved form of post-translational modification initiated by the family of enzymes known as the polypeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAcTs in mammals and PGANTs in Drosophila). To address the cellular functions of the many PGANT family members, RNA interference (RNAi) to each pgant gene was performed in two independent Drosophila cell culture lines. We demonstrate that RNAi to individual pgant genes results in specific reduction in gene expression without affecting the expression of other family members. Cells with reduced expression of individual pgant genes were then examined for changes in viability, morphology, adhesion, and secretion to assess the contribution of each family member to these cellular functions. Here we find that RNAi to pgant3, pgant6, or pgant7 resulted in reduced secretion, further supporting a role for O-glycosylation in proper secretion. Additionally, RNAi to pgant3 or pgant6 resulted in altered Golgi organization, suggesting a role for each in establishing or maintaining proper secretory apparatus structure. Other subcellular effects observed included multinucleated cells seen after RNAi to either pgant2 or pgant35A, suggesting a role for these genes in the completion of cytokinesis. These studies demonstrate the efficient and specific knockdown of pgant gene expression in two Drosophila cell culture systems, resulting in specific morphological and functional effects. Our work provides new information regarding the biological roles of O-glycosylation and illustrates a new platform for interrogating the cellular and subcellular effects of this form of post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W2078315258,"Background Chicken Mx belongs to the Mx family of interferon-induced dynamin-like GTPases, which in some species possess potent antiviral properties. Conflicting data exist for the antiviral capability of chicken Mx. Reports of anti-influenza activity of alleles encoding an Asn631 polymorphism have not been supported by subsequent studies. The normal cytoplasmic localisation of chicken Mx may influence its antiviral capacity. Here we report further studies to determine the antiviral potential of chicken Mx against Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an economically important cytoplasmic RNA virus of chickens, and Thogoto virus, an orthomyxovirus known to be exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic MxA protein from humans. We also report the consequences of re-locating chicken Mx to the nucleus. Methodology/Principal Findings Chicken Mx was tested in virus infection assays using NDV. Neither the Asn631 nor Ser631 Mx alleles (when transfected into 293T cells) showed inhibition of virus-directed gene expression when the cells were subsequently infected with NDV. Human MxA however did show significant inhibition of NDV-directed gene expression. Chicken Mx failed to inhibit a Thogoto virus (THOV) minireplicon system in which the cytoplasmic human MxA protein showed potent and specific inhibition. Relocalisation of chicken Mx to the nucleus was achieved by inserting the Simian Virus 40 large T antigen nuclear localisation sequence (SV40 NLS) at the N-terminus of chicken Mx. Nuclear re-localised chicken Mx did not inhibit influenza (A/PR/8/34) gene expression during virus infection in cell culture or influenza polymerase activity in A/PR/8/34 or A/Turkey/50-92/91 minireplicon systems. Conclusions/Significance The chicken Mx protein (Asn631) lacks inhibitory effects against THOV and NDV, and is unable to suppress influenza replication when artificially re-localised to the cell nucleus. Thus, the natural cytoplasmic localisation of the chicken Mx protein does not account for its lack of antiviral activity."

This study explored whether the rightward deviation for bisecting lines in far space extends to tasks where a ball is aimed between two goal-posts. Kicking was assessed in a laboratory and a real-life setting. In the laboratory setting, 212 participants carried out three conditions: (a) kick a soccer ball at a single goal post, (b) kick a soccer ball between two goal posts and (c) use a stick to indicate the middle between two goal posts. The goals were placed at a distance of 4.0 m. There was no deviation in the one-goal kicking condition--demonstrating that no asymmetries exist in the perceptual motor system when aiming at a single point. When kicking or pointing at the middle between two goal posts, rightward deviations were observed. In the real-world setting, the number of misses to the left or right of goal (behinds) in the Australian Rules football for the 2005-2009 seasons was assessed. The data showed more rightward deviations for kicks at goal. Combined, the studies suggest that the rightward deviation for lines placed in far space extends to the kicking of a football in laboratory and real-life settings. This asymmetry in kicking builds on a body of research showing that attentional asymmetries impact everyday activities."

We evaluated a novel algorithm based on trigonometric regression regarding its ability to map dynamic changes in BRS and autonomic tone during cardiovascular provocation in relation to gender and age. Methodology/Principal Findings We continuously recorded systemic arterial pressure, electrocardiogram and respiration in 23 young subjects (25±2 years) and 22 middle-aged subjects (56±4 years) during cardiovascular autonomic testing (metronomic breathing, Valsalva manoeuvre, head-up tilt). Baroreflex- and spectral analysis was performed using the algorithm of trigonometric regressive spectral analysis. There was an age-related decline in spontaneous BRS and high frequency oscillations of RR intervals. Changes in autonomic tone evoked by cardiovascular provocation were observed as shifts in the ratio of low to high frequency oscillations of RR intervals and blood pressure. Respiration at 0.1 Hz elicited an increase in BRS while head-up tilt and Valsalva manoeuvre resulted in a downregulation of BRS. The extent of autonomic adaption was in general more pronounced in young individuals and declined stronger with age in women than in men. Conclusions/Significance The trigonometric regressive spectral analysis reliably maps age- and gender-related differences in baroreflex- and autonomic function and is able to describe adaption processes of baroreceptor circuit during cardiovascular stimulation. Hence, this novel algorithm may be a useful screening tool to detect abnormalities in cardiovascular adaption processes even when resting values appear to be normal."

However, the presence of four paralogous Cas family members in mammals (BCAR1/p130Cas, EFS/Sin1, NEDD9/HEF1/Cas-L, and CASS4/HEPL) has limited their analysis in development. We deleted the single Drosophila Cas gene, Dcas, to probe the developmental function of Dcas. Loss of Dcas had limited effect on embryonal development. However, we found that Dcas is an important modulator of the severity of the developmental phenotypes of mutations affecting integrins (If and mew) and their downstream effectors Fak56D or Src42A. Strikingly, embryonic lethal Fak56D-Dcas double mutant embryos had extensive cell polarity defects, including mislocalization and reduced expression of E-cadherin. Further genetic analysis established that loss of Dcas modified the embryonal lethal phenotypes of embryos with mutations in E-cadherin (Shg) or its signaling partners p120- and beta-catenin (Arm). These results support an important role for Cas proteins in cell-cell adhesion signaling in development."
https://openalex.org/W2137079077,"Changes in lifestyle have resulted in an epidemic development of obesity-related diseases that challenge the healthcare systems worldwide. To develop strategies to tackle this problem the focus is on diet to prevent the development of obesity-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). This will require methods for linking nutrient intake with specific metabolic processes in different tissues.Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr -/-) mice were fed a high fat/high sugar diet to mimic a westernized diet, being a major reason for development of obesity and atherosclerosis. The diets were supplemented with either beef or herring, and matched in macronutrient contents. Body composition, plasma lipids and aortic lesion areas were measured. Transcriptomes of metabolically important tissues, e.g. liver, muscle and adipose tissue were analyzed by an integrated approach with metabolic networks to directly map the metabolic effects of diet in these different tissues. Our analysis revealed a reduction in sterol metabolism and protein turnover at the transcriptional level in herring-fed mice.This study shows that an integrated analysis of transcriptome data using metabolic networks resulted in the identification of signature pathways. This could not have been achieved using standard clustering methods. In particular, this systems biology analysis could enrich the information content of biomedical or nutritional data where subtle changes in several tissues together affects body metabolism or disease progression. This could be applied to improve diets for subjects exposed to health risks associated with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2015303203,"The Math5 (Atoh7) gene is transiently expressed during retinogenesis by progenitors exiting mitosis, and is essential for ganglion cell (RGC) development. Math5 contains a single exon, and its 1.7 kb mRNA encodes a 149-aa polypeptide. Mouse Math5 mutants have essentially no RGCs or optic nerves. Given the importance of this gene in retinal development, we thoroughly investigated the possibility of Math5 mRNA splicing by Northern blot, 3'RACE, RNase protection assays, and RT-PCR, using RNAs extracted from embryonic eyes and adult cerebellum, or transcribed in vitro from cDNA clones. Because Math5 mRNA contains an elevated G+C content, we used graded concentrations of betaine, an isostabilizing agent that disrupts secondary structure. Although approximately 10% of cerebellar Math5 RNAs are spliced, truncating the polypeptide, our results show few, if any, spliced Math5 transcripts exist in the developing retina (<1%). Rare deleted cDNAs do arise via RT-mediated RNA template switching in vitro, and are selectively amplified during PCR. These data differ starkly from a recent study (Kanadia and Cepko 2010), which concluded that the vast majority of Math5 and other bHLH transcripts are spliced to generate noncoding RNAs. Our findings clarify the architecture of the Math5 gene and its mechanism of action. These results have implications for all members of the bHLH gene family, for any gene that is alternatively spliced, and for the interpretation of all RT-PCR experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2086046285,"Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a rare disease with high mortality and significant morbidity among survivors. We have previously shown that susceptibility to HSE was host-strain dependent, as severe, lethal HSE developed after injection of human Herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) into the whiskers area of DA rats, whereas PVG rats remained completely asymptomatic. In the present study we investigated the early immunokinetics in these strains to address the underlying molecular mechanisms for the observed difference. The virus distribution and the immunological responses were compared in the whiskers area, trigeminal ganglia and brain stem after 12 hours and the first four days following infection using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. A conspicuous immunopathological finding was a strain-dependent difference in the spread of the HSV-1 virus to the trigeminal ganglia, only seen in DA rats already from 12 hpi. In the whiskers area infected perineurial cells were abundant in the susceptible DA strain after 2 dpi, whereas in the resistant PVG rats HSV-1 spread was confined only to the epineurium. In both strains activation of Iba1(+)/ED1(+) phagocytic cells followed the distribution pattern of HSV-1 staining, which was visible already at 12 hours after infection. Notably, in PVG rats higher mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors (Tlr) -2 and -9, together with increased staining for Iba1/ED1 was detected in the whiskers area. In contrast, all other Tlr-pathway markers were expressed at higher levels in the susceptible DA rats. Our data demonstrate the novel observation that genetically encoded properties of the host nerve and perineurial cells, recruitment of phagocyting cells together with the low expression of Tlr2 and -9 in the periphery define the susceptibility to HSV-1 entry into the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2021861133,"Background Ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins are highly homologous proteins that function to link cargo molecules to the actin cytoskeleton. Ezrin and moesin are both expressed in mature lymphocytes, where they play overlapping roles in cell signaling and polarity, but their role in lymphoid development has not been explored. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized ERM protein expression in lymphoid tissues and analyzed the requirement for ezrin expression in lymphoid development. In wildtype mice, we found that most cells in the spleen and thymus express both ezrin and moesin, but little radixin. ERM protein expression in the thymus was differentially regulated, such that ezrin expression was highest in immature thymocytes and diminished during T cell development. In contrast, moesin expression was low in early thymocytes and upregulated during T cell development. Mice bearing a germline deletion of ezrin exhibited profound defects in the size and cellularity of the spleen and thymus, abnormal thymic architecture, diminished hematopoiesis, and increased proportions of granulocytic precursors. Further analysis using fetal liver chimeras and thymic transplants showed that ezrin expression is dispensable in hematopoietic and stromal lineages, and that most of the defects in lymphoid development in ezrin−/− mice likely arise as a consequence of nutritional stress. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that despite high expression in lymphoid precursor cells, ezrin is dispensable for lymphoid development, most likely due to redundancy with moesin."
https://openalex.org/W2031027264,"Conformations and catalytic rates of enzymes fluctuate over a wide range of timescales. Despite these fluctuations, there exist some limiting cases in which the enzymatic catalytic rate follows the macroscopic rate equation such as the Michaelis-Menten law. In this paper we investigate the applicability of macroscopic rate laws for fluctuating enzyme systems in which catalytic transitions are slower than ligand binding-dissociation reactions. In this quasi-equilibrium limit, for an arbitrary reaction scheme we show that the catalytic rate has the same dependence on ligand concentrations as obtained from mass-action kinetics even in the presence of slow conformational fluctuations. These results indicate that the timescale of conformational dynamics – no matter how slow – will not affect the enzymatic rate in quasi-equilibrium limit. Our numerical results for two enzyme-catalyzed reaction schemes involving multiple substrates and inhibitors further support our general theory."
https://openalex.org/W2032161953,"Endothelin-converting enzyme-2 (ECE-2) is a membrane-bound zinc-dependent metalloprotease that shares a high degree of sequence homology with ECE-1, but displays an acidic pH optimum characteristic of maturing enzymes acting late in the secretory pathway. Although ECE-2, like ECE-1, can cleave the big endothelin intermediate to produce the vasoconstrictive endothelin peptide, its true physiological function remains to be elucidated, a task that is hampered by the lack of specific tools to study and discriminate ECE-2 from ECE-1, i.e. specific substrates and/or specific inhibitors. To fill this gap, we searched for novel ECE-specific peptide substrates. To this end, peptides derived from the big endothelin intermediate were tested using ECE-1 and ECE-2, leading to the identification of an ECE-1-specific substrate. Moreover, screening of our proprietary fluorigenic peptide Fluofast® libraries using ECE-1 and ECE-2 allowed the identification of Ac-SKG-Pya-F-W-Nop-GGK-NH(2) (PL405), as a specific and high affinity ECE-2 substrate. Indeed, ECE-2 cleaved PL405 at the Pya-F amide bond with a specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of 8.1 ± 0.9 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1). Using this novel substrate, we also characterized the first potent (K(i) = 7.7 ± 0.3 nM) and relatively selective ECE-2 inhibitor and developed a quantitative fluorigenic ECE-2 assay. The assay was used to study the ex vivo ECE-2 activity in wild type and ECE-2 knock-out tissues and was found to truly reflect ECE-2 expression patterns. The PL405 assay is thus the first tool to study ECE-2 inhibition using high throughput screening or for ex vivo ECE-2 quantification."
https://openalex.org/W2072103265,"How to identify true transcription factor binding sites on the basis of sequence motif information (e.g., motif pattern, location, combination, etc.) is an important question in bioinformatics. We present “PeakRegressor,” a system that identifies binding motifs by combining DNA-sequence data and ChIP-Seq data. PeakRegressor uses L1-norm log linear regression in order to predict peak values from binding motif candidates. Our approach successfully predicts the peak values of STAT1 and RNA Polymerase II with correlation coefficients as high as 0.65 and 0.66, respectively. Using PeakRegressor, we could identify composite motifs for STAT1, as well as potential regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) involved in the regulation of transcription levels of neighboring genes. In addition, we show that among five regression methods, L1-norm log linear regression achieves the best performance with respect to binding motif identification, biological interpretability and computational efficiency."
