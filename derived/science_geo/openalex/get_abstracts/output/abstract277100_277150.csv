Shoreward transport of larvae and abrupt surface temperature drops lasting days can be explained by invoking the advection of subsurface cold water to the shore by internal tidal bores. This process is predictable within the lunar cycle and brings deep water to the surface (upwelling) in a direction perpendicular to the coastline."

Bans on pesticide use are the principal regulatory device used in the United States. The economic impacts of such bans depend on the availability of substitutes, supply and trade conditions, and research and development. Without substitutes, pesticide bans result in reduced production levels and higher prices, a substantial loss of discretionary income to consumers, and a redistribution of income among agricultural producers. Most food safety concerns can be addressed by establishing standards and markets for pesticide-differentiated products, but worker safety and clean water concerns will require direct controls. Pesticide-use fees are shown to be more efficient than outright pesticide bans as a mechanism to obtain environmental goals."
https://openalex.org/W2072458558,"Through numerical simulation and consideration of phonon scattering by two-level states, the heat conductivity kappa(T), where T is temperature, has been calculated on model structures. The values obtained are in good quantitative agreement with measured data on polymethylmethacrylate, epoxy, amorphous selenium, and amorphous silicon dioxide over the temperature range 0.1 to 100 K. The calculated results reproduce the plateau feature, in the range of 5 to 20 K, that is generic to the heat conductivity of amorphous solids. Two model parameters, one characterizing the degree of structural disorder and the other related to the relaxational absorption of two-level states, are identified as being responsible for the behavior of kappa(T) at T >/= 5 K. The simulation results indicate the existence of a frequency-independent phonon diffusion regime that is consistent with the minimum phonon mean-free-path hypothesis. The magnitude of the phonon diffusion constant in this regime is shown to give a reasonable quantitative account of high-temperature kappa(T) in amorphous systems."
https://openalex.org/W2093803194,"Present theories of terrestrial planet formation predict the rapid ""runaway formation'' of planetary embryos. The sizes of the embryos increase with heliocentric distance. These embryos then merge to form planets. In earlier Monte Carlo simulations of the merger of these embryos it was assumed that embryos did not form in the asteroid belt, but this assumption may not be valid. Simulations in which runaways were allowed to form in the asteroid belt show that, although the initial distributions of mass, energy, and angular momentum are different from those observed today, during the growth of the planets these distributions spontaneously evolve toward those observed, simply as a result of known solar system processes. Even when a large planet analogous to ""Jupiter'' does not form, an Earth-sized planet is almost always found near Earth's heliocentric distance. These results suggest that occurrence of Earth-like planets may be a common feature of planetary systems."
https://openalex.org/W2044070087,"The trapping-mediated dissociative chemisorption of three isotopes of propane (C(3)H(8), CH(3),CD(2)CH(3), and C(3)D(8)) has been investigated on the Pt(110)-(1 x 2) surface, and both the apparent activation energies and the preexponential factors of the surface reaction rate coefficients have been measured. In addition, the probabilities of primary and secondary C-H bond cleavage for alkane activation on a surface were evaluated. The activation energy for primary C-H bond cleavage was 425 calories per mole greater than that of secondary C-H bond cleavage, and the two true activation energies that embody the single measured activation energy were determined for each of the three isotopes. Secondary C-H bond cleavage is also preferred on entropic grounds, and the magnitude of the effect was quantified."
https://openalex.org/W1980371021,"Numerical simulations with supercomputers allow analysis of the wide range of nonlinear physics inherent in the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic equations. When applied to extragalactic radio sources, these numerical models have begun to reproduce many of the complex structures observed on telescopic images. This combination of telescopic and numerical observations provides powerful probes of the physics of radio galaxies. In this review, some of the recent results from both two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of extended radio morphologies are described. These numerical models have allowed the exploration of important physical phenomena including the role of magnetic fields in the dynamics and emissivity of extended radio galaxies, intermittent outflow from the cores of active galaxies, instabilities and disruption of fluid jets, and the bending of collimated outflows by motion through the intergalactic medium."
