https://openalex.org/W1985406652,"Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (T(reg)) cells are essential for the prevention of autoimmunity. T(reg) cells have an attenuated cytokine response to T-cell receptor stimulation, and can suppress the proliferation and effector function of neighbouring T cells. The forkhead transcription factor Foxp3 (forkhead box P3) is selectively expressed in T(reg) cells, is required for T(reg) development and function, and is sufficient to induce a T(reg) phenotype in conventional CD4+CD25- T cells. Mutations in Foxp3 cause severe, multi-organ autoimmunity in both human and mouse. FOXP3 can cooperate in a DNA-binding complex with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) to regulate the transcription of several known target genes. However, the global set of genes regulated directly by Foxp3 is not known and consequently, how this transcription factor controls the gene expression programme for T(reg) function is not understood. Here we identify Foxp3 target genes and report that many of these are key modulators of T-cell activation and function. Remarkably, the predominant, although not exclusive, effect of Foxp3 occupancy is to suppress the activation of target genes on T-cell stimulation. Foxp3 suppression of its targets appears to be crucial for the normal function of T(reg) cells, because overactive variants of some target genes are known to be associated with autoimmune disease."

https://openalex.org/W2011882274,"Telomeres were originally defined as chromosome caps that prevent the natural ends of linear chromosomes from undergoing deleterious degradation and fusion events. POT1 (protection of telomeres) protein binds the single-stranded G-rich DNA overhangs at human chromosome ends and suppresses unwanted DNA repair activities. TPP1 is a previously identified binding partner of POT1 that has been proposed to form part of a six-protein shelterin complex at telomeres. Here, the crystal structure of a domain of human TPP1 reveals an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding fold that is structurally similar to the beta-subunit of the telomere end-binding protein of a ciliated protozoan, suggesting that TPP1 is the missing beta-subunit of human POT1 protein. Telomeric DNA end-binding proteins have generally been found to inhibit rather than stimulate the action of the chromosome end-replicating enzyme, telomerase. In contrast, we find that TPP1 and POT1 form a complex with telomeric DNA that increases the activity and processivity of the human telomerase core enzyme. We propose that POT1-TPP1 switches from inhibiting telomerase access to the telomere, as a component of shelterin, to serving as a processivity factor for telomerase during telomere extension."

https://openalex.org/W2040397331,"Infection with Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strains is associated with gastric adenocarcinoma. Intestinal metaplasia is a precancerous lesion of the stomach characterized by transdifferentiation of the gastric mucosa to an intestinal phenotype. The H. pylori cagA gene product, CagA, is delivered into gastric epithelial cells, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA specifically binds to and activates SHP-2 phosphatase, thereby inducing cell-morphological transformation. We report here that CagA physically interacts with E-cadherin independently of CagA tyrosine phosphorylation. The CagA/E-cadherin interaction impairs the complex formation between E-cadherin and β-catenin, causing cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. CagA-deregulated β-catenin then transactivates β-catenin-dependent genes such as cdx1, which encodes intestinal specific CDX1 transcription factor. In addition to β-catenin signal, CagA also transactivates p21WAF1/Cip1, again, in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Consequently, CagA induces aberrant expression of an intestinal-differentiation marker, goblet-cell mucin MUC2, in gastric epithelial cells that have been arrested in G1 by p21WAF1/Cip1. These results indicate that perturbation of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex by H. pylori CagA plays an important role in the development of intestinal metaplasia, a premalignant transdifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells from which intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma arises."

https://openalex.org/W2092642151,"Intestinal polyposis, a precancerous neoplasia, results primarily from an abnormal increase in the number of crypts, which contain intestinal stem cells (ISCs). In mice, widespread deletion of the tumor suppressor Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) generates hamartomatous intestinal polyps with epithelial and stromal involvement. Using this model, we have established the relationship between stem cells and polyp and tumor formation. PTEN helps govern the proliferation rate and number of ISCs and loss of PTEN results in an excess of ISCs. In PTEN-deficient mice, excess ISCs initiate de novo crypt formation and crypt fission, recapitulating crypt production in fetal and neonatal intestine. The PTEN-Akt pathway probably governs stem cell activation by helping control nuclear localization of the Wnt pathway effector β-catenin. Akt phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser552, resulting in a nuclear-localized form in ISCs. Our observations show that intestinal polyposis is initiated by PTEN-deficient ISCs that undergo excessive proliferation driven by Akt activation and nuclear localization of β-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W1997327044,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a multifunctional lipid mediator, regulates lymphocyte trafficking, vascular permeability, and angiogenesis by activation of the S1P1 receptor. This receptor is activated by FTY720-P, a phosphorylated derivative of the immunosuppressant and vasoactive compound FTY720. However, in contrast to the natural ligand S1P, FTY720-P appears to act as a functional antagonist, even though the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the fate of endogenously expressed S1P1 receptor in agonist-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged S1P1. We show that FTY720-P is more potent than S1P at inducing receptor degradation. Pretreatment with an antagonist of S1P1, VPC 44116, prevented receptor internalization and degradation. FTY720-P did not induce degradation of internalization-deficient S1P1 receptor mutants. Further, small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 and β-arrestins abolished FTY720-P-induced S1P1 receptor degradation. These data suggest that agonist-induced phosphorylation of S1P1 and subsequent endocytosis are required for FTY720-P-induced degradation of the receptor. S1P1 degradation is blocked by MG132, a proteasomal inhibitor. Indeed, FTY720-P strongly induced polyubiquitinylation of S1P1 receptor, whereas S1P at concentrations that induced complete internalization was not as efficient, suggesting that receptor internalization is required but not sufficient for ubiquitinylation and degradation. We propose that the ability of FTY720-P to target the S1P1 receptor to the ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation pathway may at least in part underlie its immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic properties.

It acts via a family of G protein-coupled receptors referred to as S1Pn receptors (3Rosen H. Goetzl E.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 560-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The prototypical receptor, S1P1 was originally isolated as an inducible gene from vascular endothelial cells (4Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Knock out of S1P1 resulted in embryonic lethality due to a vascular maturation defect (5Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). We recently showed that S1P1 function in endothelial cells is needed for proper endothelial-pericyte interaction, a critical event in vascular maturation (6Paik J.H. Skoura A. Chae S.S. Cowan A.E. Han D.K. Proia R.L. Hla T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2392-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated previously that S1P1 is needed for the assembly of vascular endothelial-cadherin-based adherens junctions on vascular endothelial cells (7Lee M.J. Thangada S.

This event is needed for regulation of paracellular permeability, a model system vascular leak syndrome (8Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). In the immune system, selective deletion of S1P1 in T-cells led to inhibition of lymphocyte egress from lymph nodes and the thymus (9Allende M.L. Dreier J.L. Mandala S. Proia R.L. J. Biol.

Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). However, function of S1P1 in efferent lymphatics may also be important for the regulation of lymphocyte egress, as activation of this receptor may lead to “gate closure” at mesenteric lymphatics leading to “logjamming” of lymphocytes (11Wei S.H.

These studies point to the crucial role played by the S1P1 receptor in the regulation of vascular and immune physiology. The immune modulator FTY720, which is undergoing phase III clinical trials for multiple sclerosis and allograft rejection, is known to interact with and modulate the function of S1P1 receptor (13Mandala S.

Acute agonism of S1P1 with FTY720-P leads to similar cellular effects as S1P, including intracellular calcium rise, adenylate cyclase inhibition, mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, vascular endothelial-cadherin assembly, and cell migration (18Brinkmann V. Cyster J.G. Hla T. Am. J. Transplant. 2004; 4: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Both S1P and FTY720-P induce receptor internalization into the endosomal pathway (19Liu C.H.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). However, in FTY720-treated cells, the S1P1 receptor does not recycle to the plasma membrane (20Graler M.H. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 21Jo E. Sanna M.G. Gonzalez-Cabrera P.J. Thangada S. Tigyi G. Osborne D.A. Hla T. Parrill A.L. Rosen H. Chem.

The significance of this finding is not clear, even though it was hypothesized that the ability of FTY720 to down-regulate the receptor from the plasma membrane may underlie its immunosuppressive action (10Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar, 18Brinkmann V. Cyster J.G. Hla T. Am. J. Transplant. 2004; 4: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In vivo, FTY720 exerts profound effects on immune and vascular systems. In the immune system, it induces rapid yet sustained lymphopenia, dendritic cell migration, B-cell trafficking, and hematopoietic stem cell homing (18Brinkmann V. Cyster J.G. Hla T. Am. J.

Vascular effects of FTY720 include the inhibition of vascular permeability and angiogenesis (16Sanchez T. Estrada-Hernandez T. Paik J.H. Wu M.T. Venkataraman K. Brinkmann V. Claffey K. Hla T. J.

The apparent antagonistic nature of the in vivo effects of FTY720 were surprising in light of the fact that it is an agonist for the S1P1 receptor, which is a pro-angiogenic and pro-migratory receptor (24Saba J.D. Hla T. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25Chae S.S. Paik J.H. Furneaux H. Hla T. J. Clin.

A variety of explanations were proposed, including functional antagonism and vascular gate closure (3Rosen H. Goetzl E.J. Nat. Rev.

In this report, we show that FTY720-P is a potent activator of the ubiquitinylation of the S1P1 receptor. This modification results in rapid and quantitative degradation of S1P1. We suggest that the ability of pharmacologic agonists to target S1P1 degradation may underlie, at least in part, their immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic properties.

Analysis of S1P1 Degradation by Immunoblotting—HUVEC (4 × 105) were cultured in M199 medium growth medium containing serum for 3 days. Cells were serum-starved in M199 medium without serum and other growth factors for 2 h and then incubated in the same medium with S1P, FTY720-P, or their analogs for the indicated times. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by addition of SDS sample buffer and by sonication, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad protein dye reagent). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with an anti-S1P1 monoclonal antibody (E49) and analyzed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were then stripped and probed using β-actin primary antibody (Sigma). Films were scanned and normalized for total protein using the β-actin blots. HEK293 stable clones of S1P1 wild type and its mutant variants were grown to 50–65% confluency in 6-well plates. The next day cells were incubated in 2% charcoal-stripped serum for 2 days and allowed to grow for an additional 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then treated with the indicated various ligands and analyzed as described above for HUVEC. Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—2 × 105 cells were plated in fibronectin-coated 35-mm glass-bottom Petri dishes. One day later for HEK293, cells were incubated in 2% charcoal-treated fetal bovine serum for 2 days, washed, and serum-starved 3 h prior to treatment. Then cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed and examined using a confocal microscope. For immunofluorescence analysis, S1P1 (E49) monoclonal antibody was applied and antibody staining was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat for monoclonal (1:2000) IgG (Molecular Probes).

Therefore, we examined whether endogenously expressed S1P1 is endocytosed in HUVEC using the monoclonal antibody E49 to detect the S1P1 antigen. As shown in Fig. 1A, E49 detected the S1P1 protein specifically in transfected Chinese hamster ovary and S1P1-GFP fusion protein in HEK293 cells. Heterogeneity of the immunoreactive bands most likely represents post-translationally modified receptor species, such as glycosylation and/or phosphorylation. In addition, lower Mr bands could be due to proteolysis. The immunoreactivity was competed by the E. coli-derived S1P1 antigen (29Lee M.J. Thangada S. Paik J.H. Sapkota G.P. Ancellin N. Chae S.S.

Cell. 2001; 8: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) but not by the irrelevant glutathione S-transferase antigen (Fig. 1B). Immunofluorescence analysis of HUVEC indicated that the receptor was localized on the punctate regions of the plasma membrane, in particular in cell-cell contact areas in confluent HUVEC. The epitope detected by E49 is localized on the extracellular surface, because strong membrane staining was observed in non-permeabilized cells (data not shown). Treatment with S1P or FTY720-P strongly induced receptor endocytosis. However, when the ligands were washed away and cells incubated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis (19Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), S1P1 recycled back to the plasma membrane within 2 h in S1P-treated cells whereas it remained in the endosomal structures in the FTY720-P-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, endogenously expressed S1P1 behaves similarly to the behavior of S1P1-GFP fusion protein in HEK293 cells (19Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol.

However, in HUVEC, native S1P1 appears in a punctate pattern compared with the HEK293 cell, in which a smooth membrane pattern is seen. We determined the expression level of S1P1 in HUVEC after treatment with various agonists. As shown in Fig. 2. the physiological ligand S1P only modestly reduced receptor levels whereas sphingosine did not have an effect. Interestingly, FTY720-P caused a dramatic reduction in endogenous S1P1 expression. The precursor, FTY720, was inactive. A chiral analog of FTY720-P, (R)-AFD, behaved similarly. SEW2871, a lower potency S1P1-specific agonist (EC50 ∼13.8 + 8.3 nm versus 0.4 + 0.24 nm for S1P), did not induce suppression of receptor expression at lower concentrations (10–250 nm) (Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of SEW2981 (1–2.5 μm) suppressed receptor expression ∼30%, which is equivalent to the suppression achieved by 250 nm S1P (data not shown). The time course experiment showed that FTY720-P decreased receptor levels within 0.25–1 h after treatment in HUVEC (Fig. 3A). In HEK293 cells expressing S1P1-GFP receptor, sustained suppression (0.25–12 h) of receptor expression was observed. These data suggest that pharmacological agonists and supraphysiological concentrations of the natural ligand S1P suppress S1P1 receptor expression levels in HUVEC and HEK293 cells.FIGURE 3Kinetics of FTY720-P down-regulation of S1P1 receptor.

It is possible that the phosphate moiety of S1P is more labile to the action of plasma membrane- or endosome-associated phosphatases. However, SEW2981, which does not contain a phosphate moiety, was not effective at inducing receptor degradation, suggesting that FTY720-P and (R)-AFD may induce a unique perturbation of receptor conformation and/or oligomerization so as to down-regulate the S1P1 receptor. We next tested the effect of VPC 44116, a potent S1P1 antagonist (27Davis M.D. Clemens J.J. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9833-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 28Foss Jr., F.W. Snyder A.H. Davis M.D. Rouse M. Osuka M.D. Lynch K.R. Macdonald T.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 15: 663-677Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar), on receptor internalization and FTY720-P-induced down-regulation of the S1P1 receptor. As shown in Fig. 4, VPC 44116 alone did not have an effect on the localization of S1P1-GFP in HEK293 cells. However, at 100–500 nm, VPC 44116 potently inhibited the ability of S1P (100 nm) and FTY720-P (10 nm) to induce receptor internalization, as expected of a potent antagonist. Similar findings were observed with the endogenously expressed S1P1 receptor in HUVEC (data not shown). In HUVEC, VPC 44116 treatment rescued FTY720-P-induced S1P1 receptor suppression in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, VPC 44116 prevented FTY720-P-induced S1P1-GFP degradation in HEK293 cells (data not shown). These findings provide evidence that receptor agonism is required but not sufficient for FT720-P-induced down-regulation. Interestingly, treatment of HUVEC with VPC 44116 enhanced the basal level of receptor expression within 60 min, suggesting that autocrine signaling of S1P1 in HUVEC induces receptor down-regulation under steady-state conditions (Fig. 5C). It is known that HUVEC produce significant quantities of S1P and are capable of secreting this lipid mediator into the extracellular environment (34Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N.

In addition, HUVEC express the sphingosine kinase-1a isoform, which can act as an ectokinase (34Ancellin N. Colmont C. Su J. Li Q. Mittereder N. Chae S.S. Stefansson S. Liau G. Hla T. J. Biol.

Such an autocrine signaling module in the vascular endothelial cells may have functional consequences, as S1P1 is important in the inhibition of vascular permeability (7Lee M.J. Thangada S.

Investig. 2004; 114: 1082-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Next we determined whether receptor internalization is needed for FTY720-P-induced S1P1 degradation (19Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We used stable HEK293 cells expressing various C-terminal mutants of S1P1 receptor. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that successive deletion of the C-terminal of S1P1 receptor caused inhibition of ligand-induced internalization (19Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Such mutants were used in the present study to determine whether FTY720-P is capable of inducing S1P1 degradation in the absence of GPCR internalization. In addition, Watterson et al. (38Watterson K.R. Johnston E. Chalmers C. Pronin A. Cook S.J. Benovic J.L. Palmer T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5767-5777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have shown that a conserved serine-rich region (SRR) in the C-terminal tail of S1P1 is phosphorylated by GRK2 and protein kinase-C. Our previous data suggest that the SRR domain is essential for S1P-induced receptor internalization (19Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared a mutant, S1P1-S5A-GFP, in which the SRR motif (351SRSKSDNSS359) is altered so that all the serines are changed to alanines (351ARAKADNAA359), making it resistant to phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 6, the resulting mutant, S1P1-S5A-GFP, was expressed in HEK293 cells and transported to the plasma membrane. S1P and FTY720-P induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, Akt phosphorylation, and cell migration in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells in an indistinguishable manner when the wild type and the S5A mutant receptors were compared (data not shown). These results suggest that ligand binding and acute signaling of the S1P1-S5A-GFP mutant are not altered by the C-terminal mutation. When HEK293 cells stably transfected with the C-terminal mutants were treated with FTY720-P, receptor degradation was not observed in S1P1-ΔI-GFP and S1P1-S5A-GFP (Fig. 7). In contrast, S1P1-ΔIII-GFP was degraded in a similar manner as the wild-type receptor. Thus, there is strict correlation between agonist-induced receptor internalization and suppression of receptor expression. Therefore, the SRR phosphorylation consensus site of S1P1 receptor is necessary not only for FTY720-P-induced receptor endocytosis but also for down-regulation of receptor expression. To test whether GRK2, an essential kinase involved in the agonist-induced phosphorylation of GPCRs, is needed for S1P1 degradation, we suppressed GRK2 expression by a specific siRNA (32Chen W. Ren X.R. Nelson C.D. Barak L.S. Chen J.K. Beachy P.A. de Sauvage F. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2004; 306: 2257-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8A, degradation of S1P1 was not detected in GRK2 siRNA-treated cells. Next, we tested the role of β-arrestins, which bind to phosphorylated motifs on activated GPCRs to induce receptor desensitization and facilitate endocytosis. As shown in Fig. 8B, co-administration of siRNA for β-arrestin-1 and -2 rescued the receptor from FTY720-P-induced degradation. Together, these results suggest that GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin-dependent receptor internalization is required for FTY720-P-induced S1P1 degradation. These experiments further confirm that receptor endocytosis machinery, i.e. kinases that phosphorylate the receptor and the adaptor proteins that induce endocytosis of receptor-containing endosomes, is essential for FTY720-P-induced receptor down-regulation. After internalization, GPCRs can have several fates; some are recycled back to the plasma membrane and some are targeted to be degraded in proteasomes and/or lysosomes (39Drake M.T. Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 40Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Both of these processes appear to require the ubiquitinylation of GPCRs (41Marchese A. Benovic J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 259: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar, 42Marchese A. Raiborg C. Santini F. Keen J.H. Stenmark H. Benovic J.L. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 709-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). First, we tested the effect of MG132, an inhibitor of protein degradation in proteasomes (43Tsubuki S. Kawasaki H. Saito Y. Miyashita N. Inomata M. Kawashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Treatment with MG132 profoundly inhibited FTY720-P-induced receptor degradation in both S1P1-GFP-expressing HEK293 cells and HUVEC (Fig. 9). These data suggested that S1P1 is degraded in proteasomes following FTY720-P treatment of HUVEC and HEK293 cells. However, we did not observe a defect in receptor internalization after the cells were treated with MG132 (data not shown), suggesting that proteasomal activity is not required for receptor internalization. Ubiquitination of GPCRs is a critical post-translational modification implicated in endosomal trafficking as well as sorting to proteasome/lysosomal degradation pathways (41Marchese A. Benovic J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 259: 299-305PubMed Google Scholar, 44Wojcikiewicz R.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because S1P and FTY720-P regulate different receptor fates, we tested whether they regulate S1P1 ubiquitinylation differentially. Ubiquitinylation of S1P1 was detected in HEK293 cells expressing S1P1-GFP fusion protein by immunoprecipitation with the anti-S1P1-specific monoclonal antibody E49 followed by immunoblot analysis with the anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 10A, FTY720-P induced strong polyubiquitinylation of S1P1 even though S1P was also capable of this modification, albeit to a lesser extent. The monoubiquitinylated species was also induced by FTY720-P and S1P. Importantly, polyubiquitinylation of S1P1-GFP was completely blocked by the receptor antagonist, VPC 44116. In contrast, the monoubiquitinylated species was not affected. Analysis of total ubiquitinylated proteins indicated that FTY720-P is capable of inducing a stronger pattern of multiple ubiquitinylated species only in HEK293 cells expressing S1P1-GFP (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). A reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment, in which anti-ubiquitin antibody was used, followed by an immunoblot analysis with the E49 antibody (Fig. 10B), showed also that FTY720-P induced strong ubiquitinylation of S1P1-GFP. Immunoprecipitation with anti-ubiquitin followed by immunoblot with the same antibody also showed that FTY720-P induced strong polyubiquitinylation. These data suggest that increased polyubiquitinylation of S1P1 may be critical for sorting into the proteasomal degradative pathway. Similar experiments in HUVEC to detect endogenous S1P1 were not successful due to the low level expression of the receptor in HUVEC (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that FTY720-P-induced polyubiquitinylation of S1P1 is responsible for the preferential targeting of the receptor into the proteasomal degradative pathway. Studies in yeast and lymphocytes have shown that FTY720 treatment modifies the cellular ubiquitin pathway (45Bohler T. Budde K. Neumayer H.H. Waiser J. Transplantation. 2005; 79: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 46Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a Saccharomyces cerevisiae screen, Movva and co-workers (46Welsch C.A. Hagiwara S. Goetschy J.F. Movva N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26976-26982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) noted that enhanced ubiquitination is involved in the growth inhibition mediated by FTY720. In lymphocytes treated with FTY720, proteins involved in the ubiquitin system were modulated. Thus, FTY720-P in our system may modulate the conformation and/or oligomerization of the S1P1 receptor in a manner such that it is preferentially targeted for the degradative pathway. It is of interest to note that only very high concentrations of S1P (≥250 nm) induced significant receptor degradation. Although plasma S1P levels are high, free or bioactive S1P in plasma is in the low nm range due to the sequestration of plasma chaperones such as high density lipoprotein and albumin (47Kimura T.

Okajima F. Saku K. Atherosclerosis. 2005; 178: 199-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Indeed, in situations where high local production of S1P is observed, significant receptor degradation may occur upon autocrine and/or paracrine signaling. Thus, we speculate that under physiological conditions S1P1 receptor may follow the recycling pathway primarily. However, under conditions where high S1P levels are present, for example during platelet activation and immune cell activation, etc., the receptor signaling may be attenuated by targeting of the S1P1 receptor to the degradative pathway. In summary, the present study establishes a novel link between ubiquitination and degradation of S1P1 induced by FTY720-P. We show that GPCR internalization is required for degradation of S1P1. However, receptor internalization is not sufficient for receptor degradation, as S1P treatment that efficiently internalizes S1P1 is not efficiently degraded. Exaggerated ubiquitinylation induced by FTY720-P targets the receptor to the proteasomal degradative pathway. Because FTY720-P is immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic, we speculate that ubiquitinylation and degradation of S1P1 may at least in part be responsible for the pharmacological action of FTY720-P.

We therefore sought postsynaptic mechanisms responsible for trans-synaptic regulation of presynaptic function at excitatory synapses in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We show here that the postsynaptic complex of scaffolding protein PSD-95 and neuroligin can modulate the release probability of transmitter vesicles at synapse in a retrograde way, resulting in altered presynaptic short-term plasticity. Presynaptic β-neurexin serves as a likely presynaptic mediator of this effect. Our results indicate that trans-synaptic protein-protein interactions can link postsynaptic and presynaptic function."

Pharmacological chaperones (PC) are small molecules that can stabilize the conformation of a mutant protein, allowing it to pass the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum. To date all successful PCs have also been competitive inhibitors. Screening for Hex A inhibitors in a library of 1040 Food Drug Administration-approved compounds identified pyrimethamine (PYR (2,4-diamino 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethylpyrimidine)) as the most potent inhibitor. Cell lines from 10 late-onset Tay-Sachs (11 alpha-mutations, 2 novel) and 7 Sandhoff (9 beta-mutations, 4 novel) disease patients, were cultured with PYR at concentrations corresponding to therapeutic doses. Cells carrying the most common late-onset mutation, alphaG269S, showed significant increases in residual Hex A activity, as did all 7 of the beta-mutants tested. Cells responding to PC treatment included those carrying mutants resulting in reduced Hex heat stability and partial splice junction mutations of the inherently less stable alpha-subunit. PYR, which binds to the active site in domain II, was able to function as PC even to domain I beta-mutants. We concluded that PYR functions as a mutation-specific PC, variably enhancing residual lysosomal Hex A levels in late-onset GM2 gangliosidosis patient cells."

https://openalex.org/W2131448225,"The Wnt and the extracellular signal regulated-kinase (ERK) pathways are both involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds of cancers. Recently, the existence of crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways was reported. Gathering all reported results, we have discovered a positive feedback loop embedded in the crosstalk between the Wnt and ERK pathways. We have developed a plausible model that represents the role of this hidden positive feedback loop in the Wnt/ERK pathway crosstalk based on the integration of experimental reports and employing established basic mathematical models of each pathway. Our analysis shows that the positive feedback loop can generate bistability in both the Wnt and ERK signaling pathways, and this prediction was further validated by experiments. In particular, using the commonly accepted assumption that mutations in signaling proteins contribute to cancerogenesis, we have found two conditions through which mutations could evoke an irreversible response leading to a sustained activation of both pathways. One condition is enhanced production of beta-catenin, the other is a reduction of the velocity of MAP kinase phosphatase(s). This enables that high activities of Wnt and ERK pathways are maintained even without a persistent extracellular signal. Thus, our study adds a novel aspect to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by showing that mutational changes in individual proteins can cause fundamental functional changes well beyond the pathway they function in by a positive feedback loop embedded in crosstalk. Thus, crosstalk between signaling pathways provides a vehicle through which mutations of individual components can affect properties of the system at a larger scale."

We also examined the effect of forced Reg IV expression on the apoptotic susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Forced expression of Reg IV inhibited 5-FU-induced apoptosis. Induction of Bcl-2 and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase was involved in inhibition of apoptosis. Among 36 GC patients treated with a combination chemotherapy of low-dose 5-FU and cisplatin, all 14 Reg IV-positive patients showed no change or disease progression. The serum Reg IV concentration was similar between healthy individuals (mean±s.e., 0.52±0.05 ng/ml) and patients with chronic-active gastritis (0.36±0.09 ng/ml). However, the serum Reg IV concentration in presurgical GC patients was significantly elevated (1.96±0.17 ng/ml), even at stage I. The diagnostic sensitivity of serum Reg IV (36.1%) was superior to that of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (11.5%) or carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (13.1%).

The expression of PSP94 is lost in advanced, hormone-refractory prostate cancer and this correlates with an increased expression of the Polycomb protein EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), which represses transcription via trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys27 (H3K27). We show here that these events are causally related and that the MSMB gene, which encodes PSP94, is trimethylated on H3K27 in androgen-refractory, but not in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed an association of EZH2 with the MSMB gene. The RNAi-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in a loss of H3K27 trimethylation and an increased expression of the MSMB gene. Conversely, the overexpression of EZH2 was associated with a decreased expression of the MSMB gene. We also demonstrate that MSMB is additionally repressed in androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells by the hypoacetylation of histone H3K9 and the hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region. Our data disclose a hitherto unexplored link between the putative oncogene EZH2 and the tumor suppressor PSP94, and show that MSMB is silenced by EZH2 in advanced prostate cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2088737448,"Estrogens promote cell proliferation and metastases in several human cancers. Here, we describe a different action of estrogens likely to contribute to tumor development-blocking immunosurveillance. In breast cancer cells, increasing concentrations of estrogen induce increasing levels of the granzyme B inhibitor, SerpinB9/proteinase inhibitor 9 (PI-9) and progressively block cell death induced by NK92 natural killer (NK) cells, but do not block killing by a second NK cell line, NKL cells. RNA interference knockdown of PI-9 abolishes estrogen's ability to block NK92 cell-induced cytotoxicity. Expressing elevated levels of estrogen receptor α (ERα) increases the induced level of PI-9, and makes tamoxifen (TAM), but not raloxifene or ICI 182,780, a potent inducer of PI-9. At elevated levels of ERα, induction of PI-9 by estradiol or TAM blocks killing by both NK92 and NKL cells. When the Erk pathway is activated with epidermal growth factor, the concentration of estrogen required to induce a protective level of PI-9 is reduced to 10 pM. Elevated concentrations of estrogen and ER may provide a dual selective advantage to breast cancer cells by controlling PI-9 levels and thereby blocking immunosurveillance. Expressing elevated levels of ERα reveals a potentially important difference in the effects of TAM, raloxifene and ICI 182,780 on immunosurveillance in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2152805435,"Local actin assembly is associated with sites of exocytosis in processes ranging from phagocytosis to compensatory endocytosis. Here, we examine whether the trigger for actin-coat assembly around exocytosing Xenopus egg cortical granules is 'compartment mixing' — the union of the contents of the plasma membrane with that of the secretory granule membrane. Consistent with this model, compartment mixing occurs on cortical granule–plasma membrane fusion and is required for actin assembly. Compartment mixing triggers actin assembly, at least in part, through diacylglycerol (DAG), which incorporates into the cortical granule membranes from the plasma membrane after cortical granule–plasma membrane fusion. DAG, in turn, directs long-term recruitment of protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ) to exocytosing cortical granules, where it is required for activation of Cdc42 localized on the cortical granules. The results demonstrate that mixing of two membrane compartments can direct local actin assembly and indicate that this process is harnessed during Xenopus egg cortical granule exocytosis to drive compensatory endocytosis."

The eukaryotic enzyme catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen and couples this reduction with proton translocation across the inner membrane of mitochondria to generate the membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis. Eukaryotic CcO consists of 12 or 13 subunits, with the three core enzyme subunits (Cox1–Cox3) being encoded by the mitochondrial genome. The catalytic cofactors in CcO include two modified heme a moieties and three copper ions (1Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Hakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1995; 269: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). One metal site, designated heme a3-CuB, is deeply buried within the Cox1 subunit. The other two copper ions exist in the binuclear CuA center within Cox2.Assembly of CcO requires a myriad of steps, including the assembly of subunits translated on cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes, modification of protoheme to heme a, and the delivery and subsequent insertion of this moiety, along with that of copper into the nascent enzyme complex (2Herrmann J.M. Funes S. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 354: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 286: 53-63Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A number of accessory factors, including Cox11, Cox17, Cox19, Cox23, and Sco1, are known to be important or have been implicated in the copper metallation of CcO (4Carr H.S. Winge D.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 5Khalimonchuk O. Rodel G. Mitochondrion. 2005; 5: 363-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Copper insertion into nascent Cox1 and Cox2 chains occurs in the IMS, since the accessory molecules are localized within this compartment. Two proteins, Cox11 and Sco1, are associated with the inner membrane, although each has a soluble domain protruding into the IMS. Cox11 and Sco1 mediate the copper metallation of the CuB and CuA sites in Cox1 and Cox2, respectively (3Barrientos A. Barros M.H. Valnot I. Rotig A. Rustin P. Tzagoloff A. Gene (Amst.). 2006; 286: 53-63Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Khalimonchuk O. Rodel G.

These proteins have similar spacing of the four cysteinyl residues that form the two disulfide bonds in apoCox17 and apoCox12 (1Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H.

Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Cox17 is a key copper metallochaperone within the IMS, acting as the donor of Cu(I) to both Sco1 and Cox11 in yeast (9Horng Y.C. Cobine P.A. Maxfield A.B. Carr H.S. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35334-35340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although Cox17 does not form a stable interaction with either Sco1 or Cox11, Cox17 appears to use distinct interfaces to transfer Cu(I) to each target protein. Cox17 can exist in two distinct Cu(I) conformers. One conformer consists of a single Cu(I) coordinated to a monomeric protein stabilized by two disulfide bonds (10Abajian C. Yatsunyk L.A. Ramirez B.E. Rosenzweig A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53584-53592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Coordination of a single Cu(I) ion in Cox17 requires isomerization of the disulfides such that one disulfide consisting of Cys26/Cys57 is converted to a Cys24/Cys57 disulfide prior to Cu(I) binding (8Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A second Cu(I) conformer is an oligomeric protein complex coordinating a polycopper-thiolate cluster (11Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The polycopper protein is in a dimer/tetramer equilibrium, with the polycopper cluster probably existing at the dimer interface (11Heaton D.N. George G.N. Garrison G. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 743-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The tetracopper cluster conformer necessitates that multiple cysteine residues be in the reduced thiolate state. Three of six conserved cysteines are present in a C23CXC26 sequence motif. Only those three cysteines are essential for in vivo function (12Heaton D. Nittis T. Srinivasan C. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37582-37587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A mutant form of Cox17 lacking the remaining three conserved cysteines is functional, suggesting that Cox17 is functional without either of the two disulfides in the twin CX9C structural motif. The single copper is digonally coordinated by Cys23 and Cys26, yet the polycopper cluster requires at a minimum the three essential cysteines. The essentiality of Cys24 is consistent with Cox17 existing in a polycopper configuration within the IMS.Cox19 resembles Cox17 in being a soluble protein within the mitochondrial IMS, although the protein is also found in the cytoplasm when overexpressed (6Nobrega M.P. Bandeira S.C.B. Beers J. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40206-40211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Cox19 are respiratory deficient and have reduced CcO activity. Unlike cox17Δ cells, the respiratory defect of cox19Δ cells is not reversed by the addition of exogenous copper salts. The structural similarities of Cox19 with Cox17 suggested that Cox19 may also function in the copper metallation of CcO. Here Cox19 is reported to resemble Cox17 in its ability to coordinate Cu(I). Cysteine residues important for in vivo Cox19 function are important in Cu(I) coordination.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Strains/Growth Medium—A BY4742 wild-type strain (Mat-α, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0) and an isogenic cox19Δ strain (Mat-α, his3Δ1, leu2Δ0, lys2Δ0, ura3Δ0, cox19::kanMX4) obtained from Research Genetics were used for all experiments. Yeast plate cultures were grown on synthetic complete medium lacking uracil to ensure maintenance of plasmids and utilized either 2% glucose (SC Glu) or a 2% glycerol, 2% lactate (SC Gly/Lac) mix as carbon sources. Yeast strains cultured in liquid medium were pregrown in synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose and lacking uracil (SC–Ura,Glu) and inoculated into rich medium (yeast extract and peptone) containing 2% galactose (YPGal) for growth to early stationary phase.Yeast Vectors—Four versions of COX19 were cloned into a yeast low copy vector (YCp pRS316) under the control of the regulatable MET25 promoter and containing the CYC1 terminator. COX19-Myc and COX19-Strep were generated by PCR. The 5′ oligonucleotides contained a 5′ BamHI site, whereas the 3′ oligonucleotides removed the stop codon and added coding sequence for either a 3′ Myc tag (LEQKLISEEDL) or Strep-tag II (SGS linker + WSHPQFEK) followed by a 3′ SalI site. Yeast genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR. PCR products were then cloned into pRS316 as BamHI/SalI fragments. Sequencing was used to confirm cloning products.All mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. H26A, H26M, C30A, C40A, C52A, C62A, C3062A-Myc, and C4052A mutants were generated in the COX19-Myc construct, whereas the H26AC30A, C3062A-Strep, Quad, and R63T mutants were generated in the COX19-Strep construct.The IM-tethered Cox19 constructs were created by fusing the first 104 codons of SCO2 to the existing COX19-Myc and COX19-Strep, as was done previously with Cox17 (13Maxfield A.B. Heaton D.N. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting fusion proteins, termed IM-Cox19-Myc and IM-Cox19-Strep, contain the N-terminal mitochondrial import sequence and transmembrane domain of Sco2 fused to Cox19-Myc and Cox19-Strep. IM-tethered Cox19 mutants, including the H26AC30A, C3062A-Strep, Quad, and R63T mutants, were engineered and verified by sequencing. All yeast DNA transformations were performed using a lithium acetate protocol.Bacterial COX19-Strep expression vectors were constructed using PCR. The 5′ oligonucleotide was constructed to include a 5′ NcoI site as well as optimize the first 20 codons for Escherichia coli expression. The 3′ oligonucleotide contained sequence for removing the stop codon, encoding a short SGS linker followed by the 8-residue Strep-tag II sequence (WSHPQFEK), and a 3′ BamHI site. S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was used as a PCR template. The PCR product was digested with NcoI/BamHI and cloned into the pET9d vector. Cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Protein Purification—pET9d expression vectors containing COX19-Strep alleles were transformed into competent BL21 (pLysS) E. coli. Transformants were pregrown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, induced by the addition of 0.45 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for an additional 4 h at 30 °C. For purification of copper-loaded protein, CuSO4 was added to the culture medium, to a final concentration of 1 mm, just prior to induction. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, buffer. Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing followed by repeated sonication in the above buffer with or without 1 mm DTT added. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was then loaded onto a 10-ml Strep-Tactin column (Qiagen), preequilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, buffer with or without 1 mm DTT. The column was then washed three times: once with 40 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), once with 40 ml of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), and again with 40 ml of original wash buffer. Purified protein was then eluted off with 40 ml of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm desthiobiotin). The purified protein was concentrated to the desired volume in a 5000 Da cut-off Vivaspin 20 (VivaScience) spin column. Flow-through, washes 1–3, and elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by Coomassie staining. Approximately 1.6 mg of Cox19 was isolated per liter of culture.Copper concentrations were determined for the same fractions by using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 100 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Pure, concentrated protein was subjected to 12-h dialysis in wash buffer with and without 1 mm DTT at 4 °C using a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette with a 3500 Da cut-off membrane (Pierce).For reconstitution studies, apoCox19-Strep was denatured and reduced in 6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The protein was desalted into 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, using Bio-Gel P-6 resin (Bio-Rad). Cysteine reduction was verified by quantifying reduced thiols by the DTDP assay described above. Emission from 450 to 700 nm was monitored upon titration with Cu(I)-acetonitrile with excitation and slit widths set as previously described (30Dameron C.T. Winge D.R. George G.N. Sansone M. Hu S. Hamer D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6127-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Protein was quantified by amino acid analysis on a Hitachi L-8800 analyzer after hydrolysis in 5.7 n HCl containing 0.1% phenol in vacuo at 110 °C. Metal concentrations were measured on a PerkinElmer Optima 3100XL inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Quantitation of sulfhydryl groups was performed with 2,2′-dithiodipyridine as described previously (14Grassetti D.R. Murray J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 119: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). The quantity of titratable Cu(I) in CuCox19-Strep was measured by competition with bathocuproine sulfonate. Appearance of Cu(bathocuproine sulfonate)2 (ϵ = 12,250) was measured by monitoring absorbance at 483 nm over a 15-min period. All bathocuproine sulfonate competition experiments were performed in the absence of DTT. EPR was used to quantify the amount of Cu(II) in samples. Quantification was based on Cu(II)-EDTA standards.Spectroscopy—CuCox19-Strep purified in 1 mm DTT was dialyzed in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and scanned from 240 to 600 nm on a Beckman DU640 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Luminescence of apoCox19-Strep and CuCox19-Strep was measured on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 55 spectrometer after excitation of 300 nm. Emission was monitored from 450 to 700 nm, with excitation and emission slit widths set at 5 and 20 nm, respectively.X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy Data Collection—X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory with the SPEAR 3 storage ring containing 80–100 mA at 3.0 GeV. Copper K-edge data were collected using beamline 9-3 with a wiggler field of 2 teslas and employing an Si(220) double-crystal monochromator. Beamline 9-3 is equipped with a rhodium-coated vertical collimating mirror upstream of the monochromator and a bent cylindrical focusing mirror (also rhodium-coated) downstream of the monochromator. Harmonic rejection was accomplished by setting the energy cut-off angle of the mirrors to 12 keV. The incident and transmitted x-ray intensities were monitored using nitrogen-filled ionization chambers, and x-ray absorption was measured as the copper K α fluorescence excitation spectrum using an array of 30 germanium detectors (15Cramer S.P. Tench O. Yocum M. George G.N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. Sect. A. 1988; 266: 586-591Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). During data collection, samples were maintained at a temperature of ∼10 K using an Oxford instruments liquid helium flow cryostat. For each sample, three or four 35-min scans were accumulated, and the energy was calibrated by reference to the absorption of a standard copper metal foil measured simultaneously with each scan, assuming a lowest energy inflection point of the copper foil to be 8980.3 eV.The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations (k) were quantitatively analyzed by curve fitting using the EXAFSPAK suite of computer programs. Ab initio theoretical phase and amplitude functions were calculated using the program FEFF version 8.2 (16Rehr J.J. Albers R.C. Zabinsky S.I. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1992; 69: 3397-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). No smoothing, filtering, or related operations were performed on the data.Size Exclusion Chromatography—Analytical size exclusion chromatography was utilized to evaluate the quaternary state of apoCox19-Strep and CuCox19-Strep using a 10/30 G-75 Superdex column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with or without 1 mm DTT. Data were recorded using Unicorn software and an AKTA Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography unit (Amersham Biosciences). 0.1 ml of 20 μm apoprotein or copper protein was loaded on the column and eluted over 1.5 column volumes fractionated into 1-ml fractions. Elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions were assessed for copper by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Higher protein concentrations were also analyzed. 0.1 ml of 300 μm apoprotein or copper protein was loaded, eluted, and analyzed as previously. Low molecular weight size standards from Amersham Biosciences were used for column calibration. Sedimentation equilibrium was conducted at relatively low concentrations for both the apoprotein and copper proteins in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge, with an ATi60 rotor. The Cox19 protein was prepared in the presence of 1 mm DTT for ultracentrifugation studies, and the centrifugation was conducted in the presence and absence of DTT. In each case, a dimer fit was observed.Isolation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were isolated according to the method described previously (17Diekert K. De Kroon A.I.P.M. Kisplal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Mitochondrial protein concentrations were quantified by Bradford assay (18Bradford N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213195) Google Scholar). CcO enzymatic activity in isolated mitochondria (5–10 μg of protein) was quantified by monitoring oxidation of 32 μm reduced equine heart cytochrome c at 550 nm in 40 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.7, 0.5% Tween 80.Immunoblotting Analysis—50 μg of mitochondrial or cytosolic protein was loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed with the indicated primary antibody and visualized with ECL reagents (Pierce), following incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Anti-Myc antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-Strep antibody was obtained from IBA. Antisera to the mitochondrial OM porin (Por1) and cytosolic phosphoglycerol kinase (Pgk1) were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR).RESULTSRecombinant Cox19 was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with an 8-residue C-terminal Strep-tag II extension. CuSO4 was added to cultures during the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction phase. Purification of the fusion protein on Strep-Tactin beads with DTT-containing buffers results in the isolation of Cox19 with 0.94 ± 0.05 (n = 6) mol eq of bound copper/protein monomer (Fig. 1, A and B). No other metal ions were associated with the protein as detected by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis. Purification of Cox19 from cultures not supplemented with CuSO4 resulted in the recovery of the protein devoid of any bound metal ion. The necessity of supplementing cultures with exogenous copper to recover the copper-binding conformer is also the case with Cox17 and arises from the extremely low levels of free cytosolic copper in E. coli (19Changela A. Chen K. Xue Y. Holschen J. Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Mondragon A. Science. 2003; 301: 1383-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Copper binding to Cox19 is stable to dialysis in the presence and absence of 1 mm DTT. The bulk of the bound copper (98%) is reactive with the Cu(I) chelator bathocuproine sulfonate, suggesting that Cox19 binds Cu(I) analogous to Cox17. The CuCox19 protein, as well as apoCox19, as isolated contains on average three titratable thiolates per monomer, suggesting that limited heterogeneity may exist in the Cox19 redox state. The number of titratable thiolates drops in a time-dependent manner during aerobic storage.If the purification is done in the absence of the DTT reductant, the copper content was 1.9 ± 0.1 mol eq/protein monomer, and 31% of the copper was Cu(II) as deduced by EPR. The Cu(II) is labile to dialysis, and the copper content is reduced to nearly 1 mol eq.Spectroscopic analysis of CuCox19 purified in DTT-containing buffers revealed pH-sensitive UV absorbance in the 250 nm region (Fig. 2A) and luminescence near 570 nm with excitation at 300 nm (Fig. 2B). These spectral properties are consistent with Cu(I)-thiolate coordination as seen in CuCox17. The emission is abolished by treatment with the strong Cu(I) chelator KCN.FIGURE 2Spectroscopic characterization. A, UV absorption spectrum of Cox19-Strep. At pH 7.4 (solid line), the protein exhibits a relatively broad absorbance from 250 to 270 nm. The addition of acid to pH 2 (dotted line) bleaches the broad absorption, revealing an acid-sensitive transition indicative of a thiolate-copper charge transfer transition. B, Cu(I) luminescence of CuCox19-Strep. An excitation of 300 nm exhibits an emission peak with a maximum at 570 nm, diagnostic of Cu(I)-thiolate complexes in solvent-shielded environments. The addition of excess KCN, a Cu(I) chelator, to CuCox19-Strep abolishes the observed emission.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ApoCox19 was generated by denaturation of the protein in guanidinium HCl. After reduction of the thiolates with 100 mm DTT, a fully reduced apoCox19 molecule was recovered as determined by DTNB analysis. Titration of apoCox19 with Cu(I)-acetonitrile resulted in Cu(I)Cox19 formation as judged by luminescence. Emission was maximal with 1 mol eq of Cu(I) added per monomer (Fig. 3). The addition of Cu(I) in excess of 1 mol eq resulted in diminution in the observed emission. Samples titrated with excess Cu(I) followed by desalting retained only 1 mol eq of Cu(I) and had an emission yield of a sample with only 1 mol eq of Cu(I) added. Attenuation in emission by excess copper is observed in other Cu(I)-thiolate cluster proteins, including AceI and the metallothionein Cup1 (20Winge D.R. Graden J.A. Posewitz M.C. Martins L.J. Jensen L.T. Simon J.R. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1997; 2: 2-10Google Scholar). Binding of excess Cu(I) is believed to disrupt the structure of each protein, thereby increasing solvent accessibility to the Cu(I)-thiolate bonds.FIGURE 3Reconstitution of CuCox19. Titration of the reduced apoprotein with Cu(I)-acetonitrile was monitored by luminescence. Maximal luminescence is obtained at 1 eq of copper. Following the titration, protein was buffer-exchanged and analyzed for copper. A post-titration stoichiometry of 1.1 ± 0.1 copper/protein (n = 3) was measured.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both CuCox19 and apoCox19 exist as a stable dimeric species (Fig. 4A). The dimeric state of apoCox19 and CuCox19 was confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium (data not shown). In excess of 0.5 mm apoCox19 and CuCox19 show tetrameric and higher order oligomeric species (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Oligomerization of Cox19-Strep. A, size exclusion chromatography of CuCox19-Strep. 20 μm CuCox19-Strep was loaded onto a G-75 analytical Superdex size exclusion column. Absorbance at 280 nm was monitored during separation, whereas copper was quantified by atomic absorption in eluent fractions. The bulk of Cox19 elutes as a dimer (28 kDa). The copper profile along the fractions indicates that copper is bound to the eluting protein. B, concentration dependence of oligomerization. 20 μm apoCox19-Strep was loaded onto a G-75 analytical Superdex size exclusion column. The resulting elution profile was then compared with that of the CuCox19-Strep profile. The apoprotein (dotted line) distributes similarly to the holoprotein (solid line), with the majority of protein eluting as a dimer. Higher concentrations (300 μm) of either apoCox19-Strep or CuCox19-Strep were also analyzed on the same column (dashed line). At higher protein concentration, a higher amount of tetramer species is observed for both the apo and holo forms of the protein. Absorbances for high and low protein concentrations have been normalized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to provide structural information around the Cu center in CuCox19. The copper K-edge x-ray absorption near edge spectrum of CuCox19 showed a feature at 8983 eV diagnostic of a 1s>4p Cu(I) transition (21Kau L-S. Spira-Solomon D.J. Penner-Hahn J.E. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 6433-6442Crossref Scopus (952) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Four coordinate Cu(I) complexes have near edge features above 8985 eV, and thus the presence of quaternary Cu(I) coordination in CuCox19 is ruled out (21Kau L-S. Spira-Solomon D.J. Penner-Hahn J.E.

The energy and intensity of the near edge features in CuCox19 relative to the absorption continuum are similar to those seen in the trigonal Cu(I)-thiolate cluster, suggesting trigonal Cu(I) coordination in CuCox19. The near edge features in Cox19 shift about 0.4 eV toward lower energy relative to CuCox17.FIGURE 5X-ray absorption spectroscopy of CuCox19.

Two main peaks are seen in the Fourier transform, indicating prominent back-scattering from two shells of neighbor atoms. The transform peak at around 2.3 Å was best fit with three sulfur ligands at 2.26 Å (Table 1). This Cu–S distance is indicative of trigonal Cu(I) coordination and excludes digonal Cu(I) coordination (digonal Cu–S species have bond lengths close to 2.17 Å, and trigonal species have bond lengths close to 2.25 Å) (22Dance I.G.

https://openalex.org/W2081144106,"p53 homologue, p51/p63, predominantly expressed in keratinocyte stem cells, is indispensable for the formation of epidermis. Notch1, another such gene indispensable for the process, induces growth arrest and differentiation in keratinocytes. We found that exogenous expression of DeltaNp51B (DeltaNp63alpha), one of the isoforms of p51 specifically expressed in basal keratinocytes, blocked Notch 1-dependent growth arrest and differentiation in mouse keratinocytes by inhibiting p21 expression and maintaining integrins expression. Furthermore, DeltaNp51B by itself was found to have ability to induce expression of integrin alpha6beta4, which promotes attachment of basal cells to basal membrane thereby keeping the cells in immature state. Therefore, we conclude that DeltaNp51B expression warrants integrin expression even under the influence of Notch1 and that DeltaNp51B is a long-sought factor required to maintain basal cell keratinocytes immaturity by inhibiting Notch1 activity. We will postulate a plausible model explaining the maintenance of the squamous epithelium architectures as well as offering mechanistic explanations for pathological features of skin diseases, including cancers, psoriasis along with physiological wound healings."

https://openalex.org/W2018781549,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and contributes to the malignant phenotype. Our data indicate unphosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) may transcriptionally upregulate COX-2 expression and protect against apoptosis in NSCLC cells. In A427 and H2122, NSCLC cell lines that constitutively express COX-2, only unphosphorylated STAT6 was detectable by western blot, thus, all of the following STAT6-dependent effects are attributed to the unphosphorylated protein. In both cell lines, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of STAT6 or stable expression of dominant-negative STAT6 decreased COX-2 expression. In contrast, transfection with a phosphorylation-deficient mutant STAT6 increased COX-2 levels. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the presence of STAT6 in H2122 nuclei, suggesting a direct role in gene regulation for the unphosphorylated protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, unphosphorylated STAT6 increased luciferase expression from a COX-2 promoter reporter construct. STAT6 co-immunoprecipitated with the transcriptional co-activator, p300, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that these proteins bind a consensus STAT6 binding site located within the COX-2 promoter. STAT6 DNA-binding specificity was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As COX-2 over-expression has been clearly linked to apoptosis resistance and other hallmarks of malignancy, these findings suggest a novel role of unphosphorylated STAT6 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer."

In this study we report that rapid and selective labeling of hyper-reactive thiols found in both JP1 and ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) with 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin, a fluorescent thiol-reactive probe, proceeded 12-fold faster under conditions that minimize RyR1 gating (e.g. 10 mm Mg2+) compared with conditions that promote high channel activity (e.g. 100 μm Ca2+, 10 mm caffeine, 5 mm ATP). The reactivity of these thiol groups was very sensitive to oxidation by naphthoquinone, H2O2, NO, or O2, all known modulators of the RyR1 channel complex. Using preparative SDS-PAGE, in-gel tryptic digestion, high pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing, we identified 7-diethylamino-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin-thioether adducts on three cysteine residues of JP1 (101, 402, and 627); the remaining five cysteines of JP1 were unlabeled. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between JP1 and RyR1 that, like thiol reactivity, was sensitive to RyR1 conformation and chemical status of the hyper-reactive cysteines of JP1 and RyR1.

The ∼10 nm gap at these junctions provides an environment for the assembly of conformationally coupled calcium release units (5Di Biase V. Franzini-Armstrong C. J.

Dihydropyridine receptor tetrads within an array orient over every other ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) channel anchored within the SR membrane. Triadic junctions of skeletal muscle therefore provide a specialized milieu where several regions within the “junctional foot” domain of RyR1 physically and functionally associate with the II–III loops of α1s-dihydropyridine receptors to engage a form of bi-directional signaling necessary for excitation-contraction coupling (orthograde signal) and maximal L-type Ca2+ current (retrograde signal) (10Nakai J.

JPs contain MORN (membrane occupation and recognition nexus) motifs that are thought to form noncovalent interactions with membrane lipids, thereby stabilizing physical association between the membrane partners of the junctional complex (2Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ma H. Lou Y. Lin W.H. Xue H.W. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). JP1, for example, is a 72-kDa protein containing eight MORN motifs at its N-terminal cytoplasmic region and an SR-spanning segment at its C-terminal end (2Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of JP1 protein in amphibian embryos results in formation of artificial plasma membrane/ER junctional structures, similar in the dimensions observed in TT/SR complexes of muscle cells. However, expression of a truncated JP1 lacking the C-terminal SR spanning segment results in plasma membrane targeting without the formation of junctions. JP1 knockout mice have disrupted membrane junctional structures in their skeletal muscle fibers, limiting muscle contraction, which affirms an essential role of JP1 in skeletal muscle triad formation and function (16Ito K.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The previous studies did not examine the possibility that JP1 actively interacts with RyR1 or that its presence directly participates in regulating Ca2+ release from SR. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that JP1 and RyR1 interact in a conformationally sensitive manner that coincides with changes in the reactivity of specific thiol residues residing on both proteins. The rationale for this investigation is derived from the observation that a small number of highly reactive cysteines are coordinately labeled within RyR1 and a protein of Mr 90,000 previously identified with a fluorescent cysteine-labeling technique that selectively forms thioether adducts between the most reactive cysteines present in junctional SR (JSR) and a discriminating concentration of the coumarin-maleimide probe 7-diethylamine-3-(4′-maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin (CPM) (18Liu G.

Reactive cysteines appear to represent components of an integral redox sensor that modulates RyR1 Ca2+ channel function and SR Ca2+ release (20Pessah I.N. Kim K.H. Feng W. Front.

Therefore, hyper-reactive cysteines within the RyR1 macromolecular complex are likely to be important sites of physiological and pathophysiological regulation of SR Ca2+ release. Recently, seven of the most reactive RyR1 cysteines toward CPM were isolated as fluorescent CPM-thioether adducted tryptic peptides and identified by mass spectrometry (29Voss A.A. Lango J. Ernst-Russell M. Morin D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34514-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The identity of the Mr 90,000 protein that possesses hyper-reactive cysteines and whose reactivity appears coordinately regulated with RyR1 conformation was not identified. Results from co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses provided evidence that triadin may possess these highly reactive cysteines and interacts with RyR1 (18Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar); however, these studies were not conclusive because two proteins having similar size on SDS-PAGE were precipitated with RyR1 monoclonal antibody 34C (see Fig. 7 in Ref. 19Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we use the CPM labeling method to unambiguously identify three highly reactive cysteines at Mr 90,000 that map to thiol residues in JP1. The reactivity of JP1 cysteines is regulated by physiological cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and relevant sulfhydryl-active compounds (1,4-NQ, H2O2, NO, or O2) in a manner coincident with the highly reactive cysteines identified in RyR1. Conditions that stabilize the closed state of the RyR1 channel complex enhance thiol reactivity of both RyR1 and JP1 and weaken their interaction when measured by co-immunoprecipitation. By contrast, conditions that stabilize the open state of the RyR1 complex dramatically diminish thiol reactivity of both proteins and stabilize their interaction when measured by co-immunoprecipitation. These findings are the first to identify a conformationally sensitive interaction between JP1 and the RyR1 channel complex. Our data suggest that this interaction may contribute to integral redox-sensing properties of both proteins through reactive sulfhydryl reactions. Materials—CPM was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). MS sequencing grade trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI). Low protein binding ultra-smooth polypropylene tubes were from Island Scientific (Bainbridge Island, WA). All other chemicals and solvents were reagent grade or higher purity. Preparation of JSR Vesicles—JSR membrane vesicles were prepared from rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle by the method of Saito et al. (30Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). JSR pellets were resuspended at 10–15 mg/ml, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. All buffers were de-oxygenated with argon to limit protein oxidation during handling. Protein was quantified by the BCA method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. CPM Labeling of JSR—CPM was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and stored as a concentrated stock at –20 °C until use. Kinetic measurement of the formation of CPM-thioether adducts was made fluorometrically using an LS55 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation set at 397 nm and emission measured at 465 nm as described previously (31Feng W. Pessah I.N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Vesicles were diluted to 50 μg/ml in 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, supplemented with RyR1 activators or inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. The presence of 10 mm MgCl2 constituted the RyR1 “closed” buffer, whereas the presence of 100 μm CaCl2, 10 mm caffeine, 5 mm ATP constituted the RyR1 “open” buffer. JSR were diluted into either closed or open buffers at 37 °C with stirring for 3 min before adding 10 nm CPM (1 pmol/μg JSR protein) to initiate thiol labeling. After 1 min the solutions were cooled on ice, and JSR microsomes were collected at 150,000 × g for 1 h. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, and protein content was determined by BCA assay. Recovery rates for JSR protein were typically ∼75%. Co-immunoprecipitation—JSR membranes diluted in either open or closed buffer were treated with CPM, 1,4-naphthoquinone (1,4-NQ), or an equivalent volume of Me2SO (solvent control) as described above. After recovering microsomes by centrifugation, pellets were lysed in an IP buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10% glycerol (v/v), 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. After centrifugation of the lysate to remove insoluble material, protein concentration of the supernatant was measured. Lysate protein (500 or 1000 μg) was incubated with monoclonal anti-RyR1 antibody 34C (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank University of Iowa, Iowa City) overnight at 4 °C and subsequent incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with Triton X-100-free lysis buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-RYR1, anti-triadin (GE 4.90; Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), anti-calsequestrin (MA3-913; Affinity BioReagents), anti-JP1, or anti-JP2 (32Hirata Y.

Signal detection was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. CPM-labeled JP1 Isolation—CPM-labeled JSR protein was separated on preparative (16 × 20 cm) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, 3% stacking gel, 7.5% resolving gel, under constant current (50 mA). CPM-labeled proteins were easily identified by their fluorescence under UV light (320 nm). In some experiments, gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby (Sigma). Bands of interest were excised with razor blades and processed for in-gel trypsin digestion according to published methods (33Finehout E.J. Lee K.H. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 3508-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Processing included extensive washing, reduction with dithiothreitol (10 mm), and alkylation with iodoacetamide (55 mm), before drying under vacuum. Trypsin diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3 was added to the dried gel plugs and digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile and concentrated under vacuum for further purification. Alternatively, peptide extracts were desalted using micro-C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and analyzed by mass spectrometry (see below). CPM Peptide Purification—Individual CPM-labeled peptides were purified from pooled JP1 tryptic digests by microbore HPLC with a C18 reverse-phase column (1 × 250 mm; Vydac, Hesperia, CA). Chromatographs were monitored for both peptide absorbance (UV 214 nm) and CPM fluorescence (ex 384/em 469 nm). Buffers and gradients were as reported previously (29Voss A.A. Lango J. Ernst-Russell M. Morin D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34514-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Purified peptides were concentrated under vacuum for further mass spectral analysis. Mass Spectrometry—Both crude tryptic digests and purified CPM-labeled peptides were analyzed by MALDI/TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (ABI 4700, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in positive ion mode. The instrument was equipped with a Nd:YAG laser (PowerChip, JDS Uniphase, San Jose, CA) operating at 200 Hz and controlled by Applied Biosystems Explorer version 1.1 software. The mass resolution of the instrument was better than 15,000 in MS mode. The mass accuracy in the MS mode, using internal calibration was ±50 mDa, whereas in the MS/MS mode, the mass accuracy was better than ± 100 mDa. Both the MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired in the full profile mode with ∼130,000 and 80,000 data points per spectrum, respectively. The data were acquired in reflector mode from a mass range of 700–6000 Da, and 2500 laser shots were averaged for each mass spectrum. Each sample was internally calibrated to trypsin autolysis fragments if present. Purified peptides were also analyzed by a quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer with QqT geometry (QSTAR, Applied Biosystems) for ESI product ion experiments, operating in positive ion mode. The peptides were loaded onto a reverse-phase Poros R2 microcolumn (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in 5% formic acid and eluted with 5% formic acid, 50% methanol directly into a nanospray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Voltage on the Protana capillary tips was 900 V. The instrument was controlled by Analyst-QS version 1.0 software with Service Pack 3 installed. External two-point calibration was performed using CsI ions and a peptide with mass of 828.5 Th. Mass accuracy was typically better 10 mDa, and resolution was typically better than 7000 (full width half-maximum). The flow rate of the nanospray source was ∼25–50 nl/min. The TOF analyzer was set to acquire spectra at a rate of 7 kHz over the mass range 100–3000 Da. The resultant spectra were the averages of 100–300 consecutive spectra. MS Data Analysis—All mass spectral data were transformed into ASCII format for analysis using MassLynx 4.0 sp3 software (Waters, Billerica, MA). Theoretical masses for peptides (1–3 positive charges) from full and incomplete (up to 3 missed cleavages) tryptic digestion of JP1 were generated using the MassLynx peptide editor module. Peptide masses were also calculated for all cysteine-containing peptides modified by adduction with CPM (402.16 Da), hydrolyzed-CPM (420.17 Da), or iodoacetamide (carboxyamidated; 57.02 Da) (see Fig. 1). All of the theoretical masses were merged into one Microsoft Excel data base used to screen raw MS data. In MS mode, matches between observed and theoretical masses were only considered significant with less than 30 ppm error. Peptide sequence information obtained from MS/MS experiments was used whenever possible. Prior to CPM labeling experiments, the quality of individual preparations of JSR membranes was assessed via standardized assays for ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake, [3H]ryanodine binding, and single RyR channel gating behavior (19Liu G. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33028-33034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPM labeling reactions were only carried out using discriminating amounts of CPM (1 pmol/μg protein) at 37 °C. Under these conditions, CPM labeling proceeded 12-fold more rapidly in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+, which stabilized the closed RyR1 channel conformation (i.e. channel closed buffer) compared with the presence of 100 μm Ca2+, 20 mm caffeine, 5 mm ATP that stabilized the open state of the channel (i.e. channel open buffer) (Fig. 2A). As reported previously (18Liu G. Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Pessah I.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 189-200PubMed Google Scholar) this difference in reactivity is only apparent at low CPM concentrations when JSR thiols are in great excess to maleimide, and it represents formation of thioether adducts with the most highly reactive thiols present in JSR preparations. Fifteen seconds after addition of CPM, labeling was 73% complete under channel closed conditions but only 7% complete for channel open conditions. The addition of reducing equivalents in the form of tributylphosphine, chosen for its nonreactivity toward the maleimide moiety of CPM, dramatically accelerated the CPM labeling rate for channel open conditions (Fig. 2B). This correlates with previous findings on the effect that reducing equivalents have on single channel gating behavior, showing that changing from an oxidizing to a reducing environment by shifting GSH:GSSG ratios promotes channel closure and hence thiol reactivity (24Feng W. Liu G. Allen P.D. Pessah I.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35902-35907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition to the vastly different reaction rates observed under channel open and closed conditions, we observed striking differences in protein labeling patterns when CPM-thioether adducts were size-separated by reducing SDS-PAGE and visualized under a UV lamp (Fig. 2C). A representative gel image in Fig. 2C illustrates that in addition to RyR1 at the top of the gel, only a small number of the JSR proteins possess thiols that are reactive enough to form CPM-thioether adducts under the experimental conditions used. Most notable is a particularly intense band at Mr ∼90,000 (Fig. 2C, arrowhead) that consistently reacted with CPM under channel closed but not open buffer conditions coincident with the CPM labeling characteristics of RyR1 (Fig. 2C). Importantly channel closed and open buffer conditions did not detectably alter the staining pattern of JSR proteins when the same gels were visualized with SYPRO Ruby protein stain (Fig. 2C, right panel). The reactivity of thiols on RyR1 and the Mr 90,000 protein toward CPM was also extremely sensitive to the thiol-oxidizing/reactive agents 1,4-NQ, 95% oxygen (Fig. 3A), or hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3B), or the NO generator spermineNONOate (Fig. 3C). The decreased reactivity of hyper-reactive JSR thiols in the presence of H2O2 or spermineNONOate was concentration-dependent and quantitatively mirrored their previously reported effects on RyR1 channel activity (26Sun J.

The major protein bands immediately below SERCA I at Mr 100,000 encompassing the region of strong CPM labeling (Fig. 2C, arrowhead in CL lane) were detected with SYPRO Ruby protein staining and then excised. In-gel tryptic digests were prepared from these bands, and the proteins to which they belonged were identified by mass spectrometry. Peptide mass fingerprinting was performed using the SEQUEST algorithm searching against the Swiss Protein Database. Fig. 4A shows a representative gel with the region of interest magnified (inset). In addition to identifying JP1, several proteins such as SERCA I, 6-phosphofructokinase, NADH dehydrogenase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified in the region of the gel adjacent to JP1. Calsequestrin, the major Ca2+-binding protein of the JSR lumen, was also identified at Mr 51,000 (Fig. 4A). MASCOT sequence searches identified each of these six protein bands with high confidence (99–100%). These results are consistent with proteins known to be present in JSR microsomes, and the predicted masses compared well to the migration patterns observed on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels. However an unexpected finding was that JP1 was consistently detected at Mr 90,000 instead of its 72-kDa mass predicted by its amino acid sequence. Migration of JP1 to Mr 90,000 was consistent whether the proteins were size-separated from JSR labeled with CPM or unlabeled JSR. The majority of the CPM fluorescent signal from JSR labeled under open conditions is associated with the SERCA protein, which possesses 22 cysteines and accounts for 68% of the protein within the JSR preparations (Fig. 2C). When CPM labeling reactions were quenched 1 min after the reaction was initiated by addition of either 10 mm GSH or 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, the pattern of fluorescently labeled bands was indistinguishable from unquenched reactions in the channel closed buffer condition, whereas fluorescence was barely detectable in the channel open buffer (data not shown). This indicates that for unquenched reactions (shown in Fig. 2C), the labeling observed under open conditions is directed toward much less reactive thiols than those labeled with CPM under closed conditions. Additionally we investigated whether JSR proteins in the region of Mr 90,000 were glycosylated by oxidizing samples with periodic acid-Schiff followed by staining for carbohydrate (Pro-Q glycoprotein detection kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Several proteins were positive for glycosyl-adducts in these JSR preparations, including calsequestrin that is known to be glycosylated (37Fliegel L. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M.R. Khanna V.K. Reithmeier R.A. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). By contrast evidence for glycosylation of JP1 was not detected using this method (Fig. 4B). We proceeded to unambiguously identify the location of the hyper-reactive cysteines that react with CPM under channel closed conditions at Mr 90,000. Tryptic digests of JP1 (662 amino acids; NCBI Entrez Protein data base, entry code Q9GKY8) can produce 75 peptide fragments, but only a handful of these contain cysteine(s). We separated CPM-labeled peptides by microbore HPLC with detection for both UV absorbance at 214 nm (all peptides) and CPM fluorescence emission at 469 nm (coumarin thioether adducts) (Fig. 5). Seventeen reproducible fractions were collected during 18 consecutive HPLC runs, and individual fractions were pooled after collection. Du"

We investigated the role of microsomal triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) in the mobilization of adipocyte triacylglycerols through inactivation of the TGH activity by RNA interference or chemical inhibition. Attenuation of TGH activity resulted in decreased basal but not isoproterenol-stimulated efflux of fatty acids from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lack of TGH activity was accompanied by accumulation of cellular triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters without any changes in the expression of enzymes catalyzing triacylglycerol synthesis (diacylglycerol acyltransferases 1 and 2) or degradation (adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase). Inhibition of TGH-mediated lipolysis also did not affect insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane or glucose uptake into adipocytes. These data suggest that TGH plays a role in adipose tissue triacylglycerol metabolism and may be a suitable pharmacological target for lowering fatty acid efflux from adipose tissue without altering glucose import.

Obesity is a chronic disease with increasing prevalence in most of the world but particularly in Western countries (1Organization World Health O) WH Obesity: Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic, Report of a WHO Consultation on Obesity, Geneva, June 3–5, 1997, World Health Organization, Geneva. 1998; Google Scholar). It is estimated that obesity-related illnesses cause about 300,000 deaths per year in the United States alone (2Allison D.B. Fontaine K.R. Manson J.E. Stevens J. VanItallie T.B. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 1530-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). Obese individuals are at risk for a number of medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemias, and type 2 diabetes. Obese insulin-resistant subjects have higher levels of circulating fatty acids due to increased flux of free fatty acids (FA) 3The abbreviations used are: FA, fatty acid; ATGL, adipose triglyceride lipase; DG, diacylglycerol; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; E600, diethyl-p-nitrophenylphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Glut4, glucose transporter 4; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; TG, triacylglycerol; TGH, TG hydrolase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TGHi, 4,4,4-trifluoro-2-[2-(3-methylphenyl)hydrazono]-1-(2-thienyl) butane-1,3-dione; shRNA, short-hairpin RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. released from adipose tissue triacylglycerol (TG) stores. As a consequence, accumulation of excess lipid and lipid precursors in non-adipose tissues ensues and culminates in cell dysfunction and/or cell death, a condition known as lipotoxicity (3Lewis G.F. Carpentier A. Adeli K. Giacca A. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 201-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). One of the strategies that may lead to decreased circulating fatty acid levels and increased insulin sensitivity is through pharmacological inhibition of lipolysis of adipose tissue TG. The enzymes that have been postulated to mediate hydrolysis of adipose tissue TG and, thus, provide an energy source (FA) to other tissues are hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (4Holm C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and the recently discovered adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (5Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G.

About 40% of TG lipolytic activity is retained in the white adipose tissue of HSL null mice (8Osuga J-I. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B.

Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Therefore, it can be concluded that ATGL together with HSL accounts for the majority of isoproterenol-stimulated cytosolic activity in the adipose tissue. We have characterized another neutral intracellular TG hydrolase (TGH) in hepatic microsomes (10Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TGH (also termed Ces3) associates with hepatic lipid droplets (11Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem.

TGH is also expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (16Dolinsky V.W. Gilham D. Hatch G.M. Agellon L.B. Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the hydrolase may play a similar role in the mobilization of adipocyte TG as it does in the liver. It has been reported that TGH (named p62/carboxylesterase in that report) co-fractionated with glucose transporter 4 (Glut4)-containing membranes isolated from rat adipocytes (21Lee W. Ryu J. Hah J. Tsujita T. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10041-10046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, introduction of neutralizing anti-TGH antibodies into permeabilized adipocytes abolished the insulin-induced Glut4 recruitment to plasma membrane-enriched fractions. Therefore, it was concluded that TGH plays a role in Glut4 recruitment, although the precise role of the enzyme in this process remained uncharacterized. Recent data suggest that ablation of HSL expression leads to decreased deoxy-d-glucose uptake (22Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Wagner E.M. Strauss J.G. Kratky D. Zechner R. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 2089-2099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HSL deficiency does not prevent adipose TG lipolysis but affects diacylglycerol (DG) breakdown, which results in the accumulation of DG (9Haemmerle G. Zimmermann R. Hayn M. Theussl C. Waeg G. Wagner E. Sattler W. Magin T.M. Wagner E.F. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4806-4815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). DGs activate the protein kinase C signaling pathway, which results in phosphorylation and inactivation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity (for review, see Ref. 23Kelley D.E. Mandarino L.J. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Thus, the decrease of glucose uptake in HSL null adipocyte appears to be the result of alteration in insulin signaling. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of basal lipolysis by TGH attenuates FA efflux but does not lead to accumulation of DG in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, we show that TGH does not co-localize with Glut4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in either basal or insulin-stimulated conditions and that inhibition of TGH-catalyzed TG lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes does not prevent insulin-stimulated Glut4 translocation from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in intact cells.

Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Fibroblasts—3T3-L1 fibroblasts obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in 6-well or 60-mm culture dishes except for confocal studies, where the cells were grown on the coverslips. Cells were cultured in growth media till confluent. Two days after reaching confluency, cells were induced to differentiate by the addition of 0.25 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 3 μg/ml insulin for 3 days. Cells were then washed and incubated in normal growth media till differentiated. The media were changed every 2 or 3 days. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed with adipocytes at 6 days post-differentiation. Construction of Plasmid Expressing a Short-hairpin RNA for Mouse TGH—The pSilencer™ 4.1-CMV hygro vector (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to produce TGH short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector encoding the sense and antisense template of mouse TGH from nucleotides 840–860 bp of the coding sequence. The following oligonucleotides were used: shRNA sense template, 5′-GAT CCA GCC CAT TGC TGG TCT GGT TTC AAG AGA ACC AGA CCA GCA ATG GGC TTT A-3′ and shRNA antisense template, 5′-AGC TTA AAG CCC ATT GCT GGT CTG GTT CTC TTG AAA CCA GAC CAG CAA TGG GCT G-3′. The annealed shRNA templates were ligated into pSilencer™ 4.1-CMV hygro vector, which was digested with BamHI and Hind III. Stable Transfection of 3T3-L1 Fibroblasts and Characterization of Stable Clones—3T3-L1 fibroblasts at 50% confluency in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of pSilencer™ 4.1-CMV hygro or shRNA construct using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were grown for 48 h after transfection and then passaged 1:3 into media containing 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B. To characterize the stable cell lines, the selected single colonies were induced to differentiate, and microsomes were isolated at 6 days post-differentiation to analyze TGH protein levels by immunoblotting and enzyme activity using 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate as a substrate. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from differentiated 3T3-L1 stable cell lines using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis from 2 μg of total RNA was performed using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) primed by oligo(dT)12–18 primers.

The PCR program included denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 59 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 40 s (25 cycles). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gels. Subcellular Fractionation—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA) and homogenized by a Potter Elvhjem homogenizer. Unbroken cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged at 99,000 rpm (TL100.2 rotor) for 45 min to yield soluble (cytosol containing cytosolic lipid droplets) and membrane fractions. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and re-suspended in 1 ml of TBS by sonication. Lipid droplets were isolated from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes that were incubated with DMEM media containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA in the presence or absence of 10 μm isoproterenol for 1 h. Adipocytes were harvested in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA), and the homogenates were overlaid with equal amounts of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and centrifuged at 83,000 × g (SW60 rotor) for 1.5 h to yield cytosolic lipid droplets, cytosol, and membrane pellets. Immunoblotting—Equivalent amounts of protein present in cell homogenates or subcellular fractions were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-TGH, anti-HSL, or anti-calnexin antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG as secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Lipase Assay—Differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of lipase inhibitors for 4 h. The concentration of the inhibitors used in the experiments was previously determined to be effective in inhibition of TGH activity both in vitro and in intact cells (13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with Tris-buffered saline and harvested in an ice-cold homogenization buffer, and cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described above. Lipolytic activities in cytosols or membranes were assessed by mixing 20 μl of 250 μm 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 300 μm taurodeoxycholate), 20 μl of enzyme preparation (cytosol or membranes), and 60 μl of the reaction buffer in 96-well black plates and incubating at room temperature with shaking (24Gilham D. Lehner R. Methods. 2005; 36: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of the reaction product was continuously recorded over a 5-min period using FluoroScan Ascent FL (Thermo Labsystems) at 355 and 460 nm as excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Lipid Analysis—Cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sonicated on ice, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet cell debris. Supernatant (cell homogenate) was collected and used in analyses. Media were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to remove cell debris. Lipids were extracted from cell homogenates and media with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) in the presence of nonradioactive lipid carriers (phosphatidylcholine, oleic acid, dioleoylglycerol, trioleoylglycerol, and cholesteryl oleate) as described previously (12Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The chloroform phase containing lipids was dried under nitrogen, re-dissolved in a small volume of chloroform, and applied to silica gel H thin-layer chromatography plates. The plates were developed in heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid 60:40:4 (by volume) to separate neutral lipids (FA, TG, and cholesteryl esters) (12Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Lipid classes were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor, bands were scraped, and the associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. In lipids, mass determinations extractions were carried out in the absence of lipid carriers. For lipid mass analysis, cell homogenates were prepared from control or inhibitor-treated or shRNA-expressing 3T3-L1 cells at various stages of differentiation. Lipids were extracted in the presence of known amounts of tridecanoylglycerol (internal standard). Neutral lipids (TG, DG, monoacylglycerols, FA, cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and tridecanoylglycerol) were resolved from glycerophospholipids by thin-layer chromatography using the chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2) solvent system, and neutral lipids migrating with the solvent front were extracted, derivatized, and analyzed by gas chromatography as previously described (25Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S. Chimini G. Agellon L.B. Agnihotri R. Francis G.A. Lehner R. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1122-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). FA Release from Differentiated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed with DMEM and incubated in DMEM containing 5 μCi of [9,10(n)-3H]oleic acid or 0.5 μCi of [1-14C]oleic acid per dish for 3 h. The adipocytes were then washed with PBS and incubated for 4 h with 1 ml of 0.05% BSA in PBS in the presence or absence of lipase inhibitors, 200 nm insulin, or 10 μm isoproterenol as indicated in individual experiments. Media lipids were extracted and resolved by thin-layer chromatography, and radioactivity in FA was determined by scintillation counting. To measure mass of FA and glycerol release from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA in the presence or absence of 10 μm isoproterenol for up to 4 h. Media were collected at specified time points, and the mass of fatty acids was determined with NEFA kit (Wako Co.), and glycerol mass was measured with triglyceride (GPO-Trinder) kit (Sigma). FA Composition—For analysis of released FA and TG-associated FA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in DMEM containing 2% fatty acid-free BSA for 4 h. Cell and media lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The organic (chloroform) phases were dried under nitrogen and dissolved in chloroform, and lipids were separated by TLC (hexane/diisopropyl ether/acetic acid, 60:40:4). Cell TG and media FA were recovered from the TLC plates and converted to FA methyl esters by incubation with 1.5 ml of 6% H2SO4 in methanol for 2 h at 80 °C. Resulting fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas chromatography. Results are shown as the percentage of specific fatty acid species. Glucose Uptake—3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated in normal growth media in the presence or absence of lipase inhibitors for 12 h. The cells were then washed twice with DMEM without glucose and incubated in DMEM without glucose with or without lipase inhibitors for 2 h. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 200 nm insulin for an additional 1 h followed by incubation with 100 μm 3-O-methyl-d-[1-3H]glucose for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, harvested in 1 ml of PBS, and sonicated. The glucose uptake was measured by counting the radioactivity in cell homogenates. Glut4 Translocation—For confocal immunofluorescence studies, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated as above for glucose uptake. After incubations in the presence or absence of insulin, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min, then probed with anti-PDI, anti-Glut4, and anti-TGH antibodies in the presence of 3% BSA. Glut4 was visualized by incubation with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, and TGH was visualized by incubation with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG. PDI was visualized with either fluorescein-conjugated or Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs as shown in the figures. All incubations were performed at 37 °C and washes at room temperature. After immunostaining, coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Antifade kit. The images were captured with a Zeiss laser scanning confocal imaging system. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical significance was evaluated by the two-tailed Student’s t test using Excel software. Subcellular Localization of TGH in Differentiated 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—TGH is primarily associated with the ER (15Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6679-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and is also found to co-fractionate with lipid droplets in the liver (10Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and mouse and 3T3-F442A adipocytes (19Soni K.G. Lehner R. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P.

Cellular localization of TGH and HSL after treatment of adipocytes with insulin, with a lipase inhibitor (E600), or with both insulin and E600 were essentially the same as in no treatment conditions (Fig. 1). The supernatants contained the majority of immunoreactive HSL. A small amount of HSL also co-fractionated with the membranes. The association of HSL with the ER membranes has been also observed by others (27Kraemer F.B. Shen W.J. Natu V. Patel S. Osuga J-I. Ishibashi S. Azhar S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As expected, TGH was mainly associated with membrane fractions. However, a significant amount of TGH was found in the high speed supernatant representing TGH associated with the cytoplasmic lipid droplets (19Soni K.G. Lehner R. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Semache M. Gao W. Ashman K. Pshezhetsky A.V. Mitchell G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40683-40989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which may be in continuum with the ER as indicated by the presence of an ER integral membrane protein calnexin. Treatments with a general lipase inhibitor or insulin did not alter the levels of TGH or HSL in the membrane or cytosolic fractions. Inhibition of Lipase Activity—The in vitro lipolytic activity of 3T3-L1 adipocyte homogenates was 21.0 ± 2.13 nmol/mg of protein/min using 4-methylumbelliferyl heptanoate as substrate. Approximately 70% of the total lipase activity was in the soluble (cytosolic) fractions, with the rest of the activity (30%) associated with microsomes. TGH accounts for the majority of microsomal lipase activity because both HSL and ATGL are present in the cytosol or on cytosolic lipid droplets. Table 1 shows soluble (cytosolic and lipid droplet-associated) and membrane lipase activities in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes after treatment with insulin in the presence or absence of the lipase inhibitor E600. This hydrophobic inhibitor was previously demonstrated to enter the cells and inhibit TGH activity through covalent modification of the catalytic serine residue (10Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). E600 treatment decreased the membrane-associated lipase activity by 75%, showing that adipose TGH activity is sensitive to treatments with E600 to a similar extent as in hepatocytes (13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Preincubation of the cells with insulin had no significant effect on the membrane-associated lipase activity, suggesting that insulin signaling is not involved in the regulation of TGH in the adipose tissue, a result similar to that obtained in hepatocytes (28Gilham D. Perreault K.R. Holmes C.F. Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1736: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). E600 also decreased cytosol/droplet-associated lipolytic activity by 60% (Table 1). Preincubation with insulin resulted in a decrease in the cytosolic/droplet-associated lipase activity (20% decrease, p < 0.05, Table 1) but not TGH levels (Fig. 1). The insulin-mediated inhibition of the cytosolic/droplet lipase activity may be due to insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of HSL since phosphorylated HSL was described to be the more active form of the lipase (29Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although insulin may also affect the activity of ATGL since no accumulation of DG was observed upon the treatment (results not shown). TGH activity and TGH-mediated TG turnover can be specifically inhibited by TGHi) (13Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because this inhibitor is non-covalent and would be diluted out during cell homogenization and fractionation, the protocol employed in Table 1 would not be expected to show any inhibition. However, when the inhibitor is present in the lipase assay mixture cytosolic/droplet-associated lipase activity is decreased by 24% and membrane lipase activity is inhibited by 73%, confirming that TGH represents the majority of the membrane-associated lipase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.TABLE 1Inhibition of lipase activity in cytosol and membranes from 3T3-L1 adipocytes 3T3-L1 adi"
https://openalex.org/W2028732036,"The t(12;21)(p13;q22) translocation generates the TEL-AML1 (TEL, translocation-Ets-leukemia; AML1, acute myeloid leukemia-1) (ETV6-RUNX1) fusion product and is the most common chromosomal abnormality in pediatric leukemia. Our previous studies using a murine fetal liver transplantation model demonstrated that TEL-AML1 promotes the self-renewal of B-cell precursors in vitro and enhances the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in vivo. This is consistent with the hypothesis that TEL-AML1 induces expansion of a preleukemic clone. Several studies have described domains within TEL-AML1 involved in the transcriptional regulation of specific target genes. However, it is unclear which of these domains is important for the activity of TEL-AML1 in preleukemic hematopoiesis. In order to examine this, we have generated a panel of deletion mutants and expressed them in HSCs. These experiments demonstrate that TEL-AML1 requires multiple domains from both TEL and AML1 to alter hematopoiesis. Furthermore, mutation of a single amino-acid residue within the runt homology domain of AML1, required for DNA binding, was sufficient to abrogate TEL-AML1 activity. These data suggest that TEL-AML1 acts as an aberrant transcription factor to perturb multiple pathways during hematopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2043806914,"Enhanced activity of the dopaminergic system originating in the ventral tegmental area is implicated in addictive and psychiatric disorders. Burst firing increases dopamine levels at the synapse to signal novelty and salience. We have previously reported a calcium-dependent burst firing of dopamine cells mediated by L-type channels following cholinergic stimulation; this paper describes a cellular mechanism resulting in burst firing following L-type channel activation. Calcium influx through L-type channels following FPL 64176 or (S)-(–)-Bay K8644 induced burst firing independent of dopamine, glutamate, or calcium from the internal stores. Burst firing induced as such was completely blocked by the substrate site protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine but not by the diacylglycerol site inhibitor calphostin C. Western blotting analysis showed that FPL 64176 and (S)-(–)-Bay K8644 increased the cleavage of PKC to generate protein kinase M (PKM) and the specific calpain inhibitor MDL28170 blocked this increase. Prevention of PKM production by inhibiting calpain or depleting PKC blocked burst firing induction whereas direct loading of purified PKM into cells induced burst firing. Activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid type glutamate or cholinergic receptors known to induce burst firing increased PKM expression. These results indicate that calcium influx through L-type channels activates a calcium-dependent protease that cleaves PKC to generate constitutively active and labile PKM resulting in burst firing of dopamine cells, a pathway that is involved in glutamatergic or cholinergic modulation of the central dopamine system.

The strength of DA transmission is regulated by the interplay between spike-dependent DA release, DA reuptake, and autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback. Essentially, more intense spiking releases more DA at the terminal, which in turn activates the negative feedback mechanism to shut the system off. For enduring DA transmission at greater intensity, it would require a higher accumulation of DA at the synapse without triggering the negative feedback machinery. Burst firing is one such mode of discharge that has been shown to enhance DA transmission (4Gonon F.G. Neuroscience. 1988; 24: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 5Suaud-Chagny M.F.

Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DA cells in the VTA are capable of both pacemaker-like and burst firing (9Hyland B.I. Reynolds J.N. Hay J. Perk C.G. Miller R. Neuroscience. 2002; 114: 475-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), the latter being shown to signal novelty and salient stimuli in whole animal studies (10Tobler P.N. Fiorillo C.D. Schultz W. Science. 2005; 307: 1642-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). DA cells in slices predominantly display pacemaker-like firing; burst firing can be induced by surrogate synaptic stimulation with bath application of glutamatergic or cholinergic agonists (11Johnson S.W. Seutin V. North R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Liu Y. Chen X. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 469-481Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that mobilize Ca2+. Ca2+ entry has been shown to be pivotal in regulating firing patterns of DA neurons. Intracellular administration of Ca2+ evokes burst firing, while intracellular Ca2+ chelators block it (13Grace A.A. Bunney B.S. J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2877-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study shows that carbachol, a general cholinergic agonist, induces burst firing primarily by promoting Ca2+ influx through L-type channels (12Zhang L. Liu Y. Chen X. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 469-481Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These channels are responsible for approximately one third of total Ca2+ currents of DA neurons (14Cardozo D.L. Bean B.P. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 15Takada M. Kang Y. Imanishi M. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5944-5951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this, L-type channels have been shown to be involved in spontaneous and burst firing (12Zhang L. Liu Y. Chen X. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 469-481Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Nedergaard S. Flatman J.A. Engberg I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 466: 727-747Google Scholar, 19Mercuri N.B. Bonci A. Calabresi P.

Brain Res. 2004; 1019: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Activation of L-type channels has been shown to modulate synaptic strength in DA cells (21Bonci A. Grillner P. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6693-6703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, L-type channels gate Ca2+-release from internal Ca2+ stores, activate plasma membrane Ca2+-dependent K+ channels, as well as several Ca2+-dependent kinases such as protein kinase C (PKC), Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), and protein kinase A (PKA) (22Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar). These kinases are capable of phosphorylating a variety of ion channels to regulate the excitability of neurons (23Levitan I.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finding the mechanism that controls the firing mode of DA cells would provide a vital means of modulating the system in both normal and disease conditions. Here, we present results that Ca2+ influx through L-type channels activates a Ca2+-dependent protease, which in turn cleaves PKC to generate a labile fragment that is constitutively active (termed protein kinase M, PKM) to induce burst firing in DA neurons. Slice Preparation—All procedures involving animal handling and tissue harvesting were in accordance with guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care Committee at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. Sprague-Dawley rat pups (9–21 days old) of either sex were deeply anesthetized with halothane and killed by chest compression. The skull was quickly opened to expose the brain, which was cooled in situ with ice-cold, carbogenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, composition: 126 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose, pH 7.4, when bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2). The brain was removed, and a block containing the midbrain was cut on a Leica vibratome (VT 1000, Heidelberger, Germany). Tissue slices were allowed to recover at room temperature (22 °C) in carbogenated ACSF for at least 1 h prior to recording. Slices were further trimmed to fit into a recording chamber and continuously perfused with carbogenated ACSF at a rate of 2–3 ml min–1 at room temperature. For PKC depletion experiments, one of the two VTA slices from the same animal was incubated in ACSF with or without 1–2 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 20–24 h at room temperature in a partially sealed beaker continuously bubbled with carbogen. Patch Clamp Recording—All recordings were made from the VTA identified under a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ6). Patch electrodes were prepared from KG-33 glass micropipettes (OD 1.5 mm, Garner Glass CO., Claremont, CA) on a P-97 Brown-Flaming micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). For nystatin-perforated patch clamp recording, glass electrodes were filled to the tip with intracellular solution (120 mm potassium acetate, 40 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm EGTA with pH adjusted to 7.35 using 0.1 n KOH) and then back-filled with the same solution containing 450 μg ml–1 nystatin and Pluronic F127, yielding a tip resistance of 4–8 MΩ. For conventional whole-cell recording, electrodes were filled with a solution containing 126 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm MgATP, and 0.3 mm Na3GTP with pH adjusted to 7.35 and osmolarity to 295 mosm, yielding a resistance of 2–4 MΩ. Gigaohm seals were made using a Warner PC-505B (Warner Instruments Inc., Hamden, CT) or a MultiClamp 700B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) amplifier. Signals were sampled at 5 kHz and digitized by DigiData 1320A using pCLAMP (versions 8 and 9) software (Axon Instruments). Selection of nystatin-perforated cell recordings in current clamp mode was determined by the size of the action potential, since many VTA cells were spontaneously active. After adequate partitioning of nystatin into the membrane, action potentials overshot 0 mV and measured at least 50 mV. Quality of conventional whole-cell recordings was assessed by a brief voltage step (–20 mV, 10 ms) from the holding potential (–55 mV). Only cells that had an access resistance of <30 MΩ and an input resistance of >200 MΩ were included. Cells whose access resistance increased significantly during the course of recording (>20%) were discarded. Episodic protocols were used to induce hyperpolarization activated current (Ih) and derive passive characteristics of the cell such as current-voltage relationship and input resistance. Current pulses for Ih induction were of 1 s duration, and the intervals between pulses were 8 s to allow complete recovery of Ih channels. Cells that displayed a prominent Ih and an apparent DA-induced hyperpolarization were identified as putative DA cells (11Johnson S.W. Seutin V. North R.A. Science. 1992; 258: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Zhang L. Liu Y. Chen X. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 469-481Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Lacey M.G. Mercuri N.B. North R.A. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Components of extracellular and intracellular solutions were purchased from bulk distributors Fisher Scientific (Nepean, Ontario, Canada) and VWR International (Missisauga, Ontario, Canada). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma and Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Chemicals were dissolved in deionized water or Me2SO as required. Aliquots of stock solutions were kept at –30 °C. Prior to application, an aliquot was diluted to working concentration and applied to the ACSF bath. PKM (Sigma) was kept at –80 °C and was diluted to 1 unit ml–1 immediately before use in the internal solution for conventional whole-cell recording. DA solution was made fresh daily with an equimolar concentration of the antioxidant disodium metabisulfite. Western Blotting—Phosphorylated PKC and PKM were detected by a phospho-PKC (pan) antibody (Cell Signaling) that recognizes PKCα,-βI, -βII, -δ,-ϵ,-η, and -θ isoforms only when phosphorylated at a carboxyl-terminal residue homologous to Ser660 of PKCβII. Ser-660 is in the catalytic domain of PKC and allows simultaneous visualization of phosphorylated PKC and PKM. VTA slices from the same animal were hemisected to give equivalent halves for control and experimental groups. Slices were trimmed to contain the VTA and part of the substantia nigra and were homogenized in RIPA (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% deoxycholate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 75 ng/ml phenylmethylsulfanyl fluoride and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Quebec, Canada)). Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 10 min), and protein concentration for each sample was determined by BCA™ assay using bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). Equivalent mass of total protein from slice homogenates were separated on an 8.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The blots were blocked with Blotto (5% w/v nonfat milk in TBST (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20); 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with phospho-PKC (pan) antibody (1: 1,000) diluted in Blotto, rocking overnight at 4 °C. Blots were washed five times in TBST and followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG diluted in Blotto (Cell Signaling, 1:15,000) for 90 min at room temperature. After five washes in TBST, blots were incubated in enhanced SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) to visualize specific immune complexes using hyperfilm x-ray film (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were then stripped in a solution of 2% SDS, 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C. Stripping solution was removed by two washes with TBST at room temperature, followed by blocking with Blotto and incubation with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma, 1:4,000) to act as loading controls. Quantification was obtained from densitometric measurements of immunoreactive bands using Gel Logic100 imaging system with Gel Logic200 Software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Data Analysis—Electrophysiological data were analyzed off-line with Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft Inc., Decatur, GA) and pCLAMP software. Basal firing frequencies were averaged values of at least 5 min stable baseline recording. Ih was measured as the difference in current or voltage between instantaneous and steady-state readings. Analysis of firing behavior was based on interspike intervals (ISIs) measured with the Mini Analysis program. Averaged as well as instantaneous firing frequencies were derived from those intervals. Coefficient of variance (CV) was calculated as the mean of ISIs over a 1-min period divided by their standard deviation. To compare CV values between cell groups, they were normalized against the mean CV value of the first 5 min. Relative density of ISIs in 2-s bins were plotted to reveal the distribution of a given ISI series, and the resulting histogram was fitted to a Lowess function. Burst firing was defined as two spikes or more in each bursting cycle at a frequency higher than non-bursting periods and separated by a post-burst hyperpolarization. For Western blotting analysis, density of phospho-PKM and PKC bands were normalized against the density of β-actin from the same sample. Data were expressed as means and S.E. Statistical comparisons of electrophysiological data were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Western blotting data were compared using paired t test since each control and experimental pair contained hemisected slices from the same animal. Values were considered significant when p < 0.05. Except when indicated, experiments were done using the nystatinperforated whole-cell recording method at room temperature. Dialysis of PKM into recorded cells was done using conventional whole-cell recording. Only DA cells in the VTA identified according to criteria out-lined under “Experimental Procedures” were included. In nystatinperforated recording, the average hyperpolarization following a brief application of 50 μm DA (within 90 s) was –8.29 ± 0.57 mV (n = 71, excluding cells used for PKC depletion test). Most cells (47 of 71, 66%) were spontaneously active with single spike firing at a low basal firing frequency of 0.41 ± 0.04 Hz; the remainder (24 of 71, 34%) were quiescent during base-line recordings. Opening of L-type Calcium Channels Converts Firing Patterns—Bath application of 1–4 μm FPL 64176, a benzoylpyrole site L-type calcium channel opener, for 5–10 min converted firing patterns from quiescent state or single spiking to burst firing in 80.3% of treated cells (57 of 71), application of 1 μm FPL 64176 induced burst firing in 63.5% cells (33 of 52). The responses were spike-dependent. Percentage of converted burst firing in spontaneously firing cells (41 of 47, 87.2%) was much higher than that in quiescent cells (16 of 24, 66.7%), a response that appeared to be related to their different resting membrane potentials (–49.35 ± 0.54 mV for spiking cells versus –52.52 ± 0.92 mV for quiescent cells, p < 0.05). The responses were dose-dependent: 2 μm FPL 64176 induced burst firing in 9 of 17 cells that did not respond to 1 μm and similarly, 4 μm induced burst firing in 4 of 10 cells that did not respond following a dose of 2 μm. In cells that were spontaneously firing, FPL 64176 first induced a membrane depolarization (2.00 ± 0.38 mV, n = 41) accompanied by a 48.8 ± 9.3% increase in firing rate in the first 5 min of drug application; burst firing started after a varying period of latency. The lag between the start of drug application and burst firing ranged between 5 and 25 min with an average of 13 min (Fig. 1, A and F). Within a burst firing cycle, action potentials were fired with increasing frequencies followed by a pronounced post-burst hyperpolarization (Fig. 1B). The average intra-burst firing frequency (1.12 ± 0.13 Hz, n = 41) was much higher than basal tonic frequency (0.43 ± 0.05 Hz). The development of burst firing in quiescent cells (n = 16) was slightly different: they responded to FPL 64176 with a membrane depolarization (1.38 ± 0.38 mV) followed by a sudden appearance of burst firing (Fig. 1D) or irregular single spiking that evolved into burst firing (Fig. 1E). The L-type channel-mediated burst firing was long lasting even after prolonged washout up to 3 h; however, it was readily inhibited by L-type channel blocker nifedipine at a range of doses (1–10 μm, n = 29). Density plots of ISIs in 2-s bins showed an ISI distribution that fits to a single Gaussian distribution under control conditions and to a mixed Gaussian distribution following FPL 64176 application (Fig. 1C). The leftward shift of the main peak indicates higher firing frequencies and the second peak at much lower frequency represents the long pauses of firing between adjacent bursts. Bath application of 5 μm (S)-(–)-Bay K8644, a dihydropyridine site L-type channel activator, also induced burst firing in three of five cells tested (Fig. 1G). The time course of the response was similar to that following FPL 64176, a depolarization and an increase in firing rates followed by a conversion of firing patterns 10–25 min after the start of application. FPL 64176 Induces Burst Firing Independent of an Intermediate Transmitter—L-type channels have been shown to enhance a slow NMDA current in DA neurons (21Bonci A. Grillner P. Mercuri N.B. Bernardi G. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6693-6703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that L-type channel opening could induce burst firing by promoting glutamate transmission. Because FPL 64176-induced burst firing was long lasting, we examined the involvement of synaptic mechanisms in two ways: whether induced burst firing persisted in the presence of a mixture containing 100 μm APV, 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, and 100 μm picrotoxin (blocking NMDA, AMPA, and GABAA receptors, respectively) and whether pretreatment with this mixture altered the ability of FPL 64176 to induce burst firing. FPL 64176-induced burst firing was robust following the application of the mixture for 10–30 min (n = 7, Fig. 2A). Similarly, cells that were treated with the mixture for 5–10 min prior to FPL 64176 (1 μm) application in the presence of the mixture still responded with burst firing (n = 3). These results suggest that L-type channel opening does not induce burst firing either directly through increased glutamatergic transmission or indirectly by way of GABAergic interneurons in the VTA. Activation of L-type channels may release DA from the soma and dendrites, since this release has been shown to be Ca2+-dependent (25Chen B.T. Rice M.E. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7841-7847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beckstead M.J. Grandy D.K. Wickman K. Williams J.T. Neuron. 2004; 42: 939-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). DA acting at somatodendritic autoreceptors forms the short loop negative feedback to regulate the excitability of DA cells, we therefore examined whether D2 receptors were involved in burst firing. The D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (1–10 μm) applied for 10–15 min to 5 burst firing cells induced by FPL 64176 had no effect on firing patterns (Fig. 2B). Two cells to which 10 μm sulpiride was applied for 8 min prior to FPL 64176 application in the presence of sulpiride displayed burst firing similar to that induced by FPL 64176 alone. These data suggest that L-type channel activation does not result in somatodendritic DA release to induce burst firing. Internal Ca2+ Stores Are Not Involved—Ca2+ entry through L-type channels gates ryanodine receptors on internal Ca2+ stores to mediate Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (22Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4141) Google Scholar), we tested whether this was involved in burst firing. Cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) and thapsigargin were used to inhibit the sarco-endoreticulum Ca2+-dependent ATPase (SERCA) that refills internal Ca2+ stores. After burst firing was induced by FPL 64176, CPA (20–30 μm) applied for 20–60 min (n = 4) or thapsigargin (1–2 μm) applied for 50–70 min (n = 3) did not alter the induced burst firing (Fig. 2C). In three cells that were pretreated with CPA (20 μm) for 30 min, FPL 64176 (1 μm) was still able to induce strong burst firing. These results indicate that internal Ca2+ stores are not necessary for L-type channel-mediated burst firing. Ca2+-dependent Protein Kinase Mediates Burst Firing—Increased intracellular Ca2+ activates Ca2+-sensitive protein kinases such as PKC, PKA, and CaMKII that can phosphorylate ion channels including L-type channels themselves and regulate the excitability of neurons (27Dzhura I. Wu Y. Colbran R.J. Balser J.R. Anderson M.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 28Young C.E. Yang C.R. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 207-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After burst firing was induced by FPL 64176, bath application of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (5 or 10 μm) for 40–130 min (n = 4), the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1–10 μm) for 25–100 min (n = 6), or both for 60–70 min (n = 3) did not block burst firing (Fig. 3A). The substrate site PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine (40 μm), applied for 15–44 min (n = 6) completely blocked FPL 64176-induced burst firing and the accompanying membrane potential oscillation. This blockade was reversible since burst firing reappeared after washing out chelerythrine for 18–33 min (Fig. 3B). To establish the role of PKC in burst firing, we further used an inhibitor that binds to the diacylglycerol site of the regulatory domain. Calphostin C (1–2 μm) applied for 40–180 min (n = 4) was largely ineffective except in one cell where burst firing slowed marginally but persisted (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the catalytic subunit of PKC itself or a kinase with a similar substrate site is involved in burst firing. Proteolytic Cleavage of PKC Mediates Burst Firing—To solve the apparent inconsistency between the two PKC inhibitors, we considered other modes of PKC activation. Ca2+ entry has been shown to activate the protease calpain that proteolytically cleaves PKC to form PKM which has been shown to be constitutively active with a very short half-life within the cell (31Kishimoto A. Kajikawa N. Shiota M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Al Z. Cohen C.M. Biochem.

Beermann M.L. Griffin W.R. Leli U. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether proteolytic cleavage of PKC could explain the inconsistency in response to the two PKC inhibitors. Cells were induced to burst fire by FPL 64176; the calpain inhibitor MDL 28170 (200 μm) was then applied. In all cells tested as such, burst firing reverted to single spike firing in 25–40 min and resumed after washing 20–30 min (n = 5, Fig. 4A). Prior application of MDL 28170 (200 μm) for 30–40 min completely prevented FPL 64176-induced (2–4 μm) burst firing (n = 3). To further validate the role of PKM in L-type channel-induced burst firing, we compared the levels of phospho-PKC and PKM by Western blotting total protein lysates from slices that were treated with (S)-(–)-Bay K8644 or FPL 64176 alone and with MDL 28170 followed by FPL 64176. As shown in Fig. 4B, phospho-PKC antibody raised against the catalytic domain visualized three bands: two at ∼82 kDa corresponding to intact PKC isoforms and another at 45 kDa corresponding to the PKC catalytic unit or PKM. Application of L-type channel opener FPL 64176 (2 μm) or (S)-(–)-Bay K8644 (5 μm) for 30 min caused a considerable increase in phospho-PKM expression (Fig. 4C). Densitometry of the bands corresponding to phospho-PKM showed that (S)-(–)-Bay K 8644 (224 ± 61% relative to untreated values, n = 8, p < 0.05) or FPL 64176 (244 ± 51% relative to untreated values, n = 6, p < 0.05) significantly increased phospho-PKM levels (Fig. 4D). The increase by FPL 64176 could be completely blocked by prior treatment with the calpain inhibitor MDL 28170 (200 μm for 30 min; 8 ± 1% of FPL 64176 alone, n = 5, p < 0.0001; Fig. 4, C and D). There were no detectable changes in full-length phospho-PKC levels following (S)-(–)-Bay K8644 (102 ± 10% of control values, n = 8, p > 0.05), FPL 64176 (104 ± 6% of control values, n = 6, p > 0.05) o"

Mutagenesis of many of these residues in BLT1 resulted in loss of signaling capacity while retaining normal LTB4 binding function. Thus, polar residues within TMs III, V, and VI and extracellular loop 2 are critical for ligand binding, whereas polar residues in TMs II, III, and VII play a central role in transducing the ligand-induced conformational change to activation.

GPCRs constitute the single largest group of molecules for drug targets due to their critical importance in mediating biological responses as well as their easy accessibility on the cell surface. However, very little structural information is available for GPCRs due to difficulties in purifying and obtaining crystal structures for this class of receptors. The availability of the rhodopsin crystal structure (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Recently, the high affinity LTB4 receptor, BLT1, was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to form a functional pentameric complex with heterotrimeric G-proteins (20Baneres J.L. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Computational modeling has been used to investigate the potential role of the eighth helix in signaling of BLT1 (21Okuno T.

Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32049-32052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study reported an LTB4 binding site in BLT1 deduced from computational models (23Sabirsh A. Bywater R.P. Bristulf J. Owman C. Haeggstrom J.Z. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5733-5744Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of the LTB4 binding site and the potential changes in receptor conformation following LTB4 binding remain unknown. In this study, computational modeling together with site-directed mutagenesis led to precise mapping and validation of the LTB4 binding site in BLT1. Mutation of each of the residues predicted to be in the putative binding site resulted in reduced binding affinity. Furthermore, analysis of dynamic structures of the ligand-free and ligand-bound BLT1 allowed prediction of critical movements of transmembrane helices and essential interhelical interactions stabilizing both the active and inactive states of the receptor. This analysis uncovered an activation core centered around Asp-64 (D2.50; according to the Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering system) (11Sealfon S.C. Chi L. Ebersole B.J. Rodic V. Zhang D. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. J. Biol.

The deduced mechanism of BLT1 activation was consistent with the experimental observations made with several mutants of activation core residues. Homology Modeling and Identification of LTB4 Binding Site in BLT1—The multiple alignment of the human LTB4 receptors, BLT1 and BLT2, with bovine rhodopsin was generated using ClustalW (24Eddy S.R. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell Syst. Mol. Biol. 1995; 3: 114-120PubMed Google Scholar). The alignment was in agreement with the known literature on helix stabilization motifs, disulfide linkage conservation, and core-forming residue conservation in GPCRs (25Rader A.J. Anderson G.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). The homology model of BLT1 was energy-minimized (hydrogen atom addition was carried out by using xleap and minimized using 5,000 steps of steepest descent followed by 20,000 steps of conjugate gradient using AMBER8 (27Wang J. Wolf R.M. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1157-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12138) Google Scholar) sander with ff99) and then used for docking with LTB4.A structure for LTB4 was generated in SYBYL7.0 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO), and charges and potentials were assigned to the receptor (Kollman All) and ligand (gasteiger). A consensus docking approach was used wherein multiple docking algorithms were employed to improve the scoring process. LTB4 was docked into BLT1 using DOCK (28Ewing T.J. Makino S. Skillman A.G. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 411-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), SURFLEX (29Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), and AUTODOCK (30Morris G.M. Morris G.D. Halliday R.S Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9302) Google Scholar). The consensus structure for ligand-docked BLT1 was refined using restricted molecular dynamics using the SYBYL7.0 dynamics module, employing the AMBER 7 FF99 for 500 ps with a 1-fs time step. The “aggregates” option was employed to keep frozen (fixed) all the parts of the receptor except the ligand, and the ligand binding zone was defined as having a radius of 8 Å with the ligand as center. The resulting structure was then energy-minimized (5,000 steps of steepest descent followed by 20,000 steps of conjugate gradient), and molecular dynamics simulations in vacuo were carried out (100,000, 25 ps followed by 300,000 for 125 ps with positional restraints of 1000 kcal (mol Å)-1) using AMBER 8 (27Wang J. Wolf R.M. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1157-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12138) Google Scholar) (sander ff99) on the entire receptor, excluding the above defined binding pocket residues and the ligand, which were left unrestrained to further optimize contacts and relax the pocket. The binding mode was visualized using Insight II (Accelrys Inc.) and SYBYL7.0. The figures were generated with Insight II, Molscript (31Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar), and Raster3D (31Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Molecular Dynamics Simulations—Molecular dynamics simulations of the ligand-bound and ligand-free forms of the receptor were carried out in a lipid bilayer solvated system consisting of lipid, water, and ions using previously reported protocols (32Trent J.O. Wang Z.X. Murray J.L. Shao W. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47136-47144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Specifically, xleap was used to generate the solvated lipid bilayer system, comprising the homology model of BLT1, 375 pre-equilibrated dodecyl maltoside lipid molecules, 10,111 TIP3P solvent molecules, and Cl- ions added for neutrality. Our standard equilibrium and production-run protocols were used (32Trent J.O. Wang Z.X. Murray J.L. Shao W. Tamamura H. Fujii N. Peiper S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47136-47144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the AMBER-99 force field using AMBER 8.0, and the following: Message Passing Interface Sander module in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (p = 1 atmosphere) and anisotropic pressure scaling (ntp = 2); periodic boundary conditions with PME; and 1.5-fs time step. Hydrogen atoms were frozen using SHAKE. The ligand was parameterized with an antechamber program (33Wang J. Wang W. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. J. Mol. Graph Model. 2006; 25: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (3577) Google Scholar) using the general AMBER force field and HF/6 - 31G*-derived RESP atomic charges from GAMESS. The production runs were unrestrained and were carried out for 5 ns using 32 Opteron processors. The same protocol was followed for BLT1 with and without the bound natural agonist, LTB4. Molecular dynamics trajectories were analyzed via energy versus time and root mean square deviation (of the backbone atoms) versus time for the post equilibration production phase. The analysis established the energetic and structural stability of the system for both ligand-free and ligand-bound BLT1 simulations. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The construction of cDNA of hemagglutinin epitope-tagged BLT1 was described previously (34Jala V.R. Shao W.H. Haribabu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4880-4887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A red fluorescent protein (RFP)-monomer was tagged at the C terminus of BLT1 by in-frame cloning of the entire coding region of the receptor without a stop codon ahead of the RFP-coding region in pDsRed-monomer N1 vector (BD Biosciences 632465). Site-specific mutants of BLT1-RFP-monomer were generated using the PCR-based sense/antisense primer method (35Rao J.V. Prakash V. Rao N.A. Savithri H.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5967-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and all mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of Receptors and Generation of Clonal Stable Cell Lines—Functional properties of the native and mutant receptors were examined in 300.19 cells. 300.19 is a murine pre-B cell line with no detectable endogenous expression of any LTB4 responsive receptors and was previously used to study the signal transduction pathways activated by leukocyte adhesion molecules (36Steeber D.A. Engel P. Miller A.S. Sheetz M.P. Tedder T.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 952-963PubMed Google Scholar) and chemokine receptors (37Ogilvie P. Thelen S. Moepps B. Gierschik P. da Silva Campos A.C. Baggiolini M. Thelen M. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 6715-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 300.19 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and transfected by electroporation. The stable single cell-derived cell lines with BLT1 or its mutants were selected by FACS (Moflo) and maintained in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418. The cell surface expression was determined by incubating parental cells or cells expressing different receptor variants with 12CA5 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG and analyzed using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Ligand Binding—Whole cell competition ligand binding (34Jala V.R. Shao W.H. Haribabu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4880-4887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or saturation binding (13Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) assays were performed with 300.19 cells expressing BLT1 or its mutants. For competition binding assay, the cells (0.5 × 106 per assay) were incubated with 2.5 nm [3H]LTB4 (0.25 nm for BLT1) (163 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) along with increasing concentrations of cold ligand (Cayman Chemicals, Detroit, MI) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free Fraction V, Sigma A8806)). These mixtures were incubated on ice with gentle agitation for 2 h followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Whatman 1822-025) using manifold-vacuum setup and washed with 3 ml of ice-cold binding buffer. The radioactivity of the filters was determined with a Beckman Coulter LS6500 multipurpose scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by inclusion of 2 μm unlabeled LTB4 to the cells suspended in 2.5 nm [3H]LTB4. The competition curves were generated using non-linear regression fit on GraphPad Prism software, and the EC50 was determined. Saturation binding was also performed using whole cells. The binding mixture contained whole cells and [3H]LTB4 at various concentrations with or without unlabeled LTB4 in a 1000-fold excess. The 100-μl binding reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters, and radioactivity was measured as described above. The saturation binding curves were generated using one site binding (hyperbola) non-linear regression curve fitting (GraphPad Prism 4.0). Kd and Bmax were determined from these curves and expressed as nanomolar and binding sites/cell, respectively. Similar values were obtained from Scatchard analysis of the data. Chemotaxis and Calcium Measurements—Migration of 300.19 cells was evaluated using 5-μm pore size Transwell filters (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). Cells (1 × 107) were resuspended in 1 ml of chemotaxis buffer (RPMI 1640, 1% fetal bovine serum). The lower chamber was loaded with various concentrations of LTB4 in a volume of 600 μl, and 100 μl (1 × 106 cells) of cells from the above cell suspension was placed onto the upper chamber. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the upper chamber was removed, and cells in the lower chamber were counted in a Bürker chamber. Calcium mobilization was monitored in INDO-I-loaded cells (300.19 cells expressing BLT1-WT or its mutants) stimulated with various concentrations of LTB4 as previously described (34Jala V.R. Shao W.H. Haribabu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4880-4887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Receptor Phosphorylation—300.19 cells (5 million cells per sample) expressing BLT1-RFP or its mutants were serum-starved for 2 h in 5 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. Cells were washed with the same buffer and labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (150 μCi per sample, 8500-9120 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the above buffer in a total volume of 1.5 ml for 1.5 h, and cells were stimulated for 5 min at 37 °C with LTB4 at concentrations indicated. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The harvested cells were lysed with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease mixture inhibitor tablet from Roche Applied Science). Hemagglutinin-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated with high affinity anti-hemagglutinin antibody (clone 3F10 from Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and dried gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens and analyzed on a Typhoon 9400 variable-mode gel imager (Amersham Biosciences). Integrated counts were evaluated using ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Real-time Fluorescence Microscopy—RBL-2H3 cells were co-transfected with β-arrestin-GFP and either with wild-type or mutant receptor tagged with RFP (monomer), and images were captured as described previously (18Jala V.R. Haribabu B. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 315-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Jala V.R. Shao W.H. Haribabu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4880-4887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Identification of LTB4 Binding Site in BLT1—Bovine rhodopsin had been the only available crystal structure (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) for a GPCR and hence heavily relied upon for homology modeling-based approaches for structural studies of GPCRs. The rhodopsin ligand (11-cis-retinal) is covalently linked to the receptor, whereas LTB4 is a mostly hydrophobic lipid with three nodes of polarity. The polar head group is a carboxylate, which can form hydrogen bonding or strong ionic interactions, and the hydroxyl groups at the 5th and 12th carbon positions are also capable of forming hydrogen bonding interactions. To obtain a starting structure for BLT1, a sequence alignment of human BLT1 with bovine rhodopsin (1F88) was generated. This alignment was then manually modified to precisely match the known motifs in the transmembrane (TM) regions for rhodopsin with those of BLT1. A homology-based three-dimensional structural model for human BLT1 that included a conserved disulfide linkage between Cys-90 and Cys-168 (25Rader A.J. Anderson G. Isin B. Khorana H.G. Bahar I. Klein-Seetharaman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7246-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 38Baneres J.L. Martin A. Hullot P. Girard J.P. Rossi J.C. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 801-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was generated and energy minimized. A “consensus docking protocol” that used three independent docking algorithms, AUTODOCK (30Morris G.M. Morris G.D. Halliday R.S Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9302) Google Scholar), SURFLEX (29Jain A.N. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar), and DOCK (28Ewing T.J. Makino S. Skillman A.G. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 411-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), was employed to obtain a ligand-docked structure for BLT1. The top three ranked results from each of the docking runs were analyzed, and the highest common factor or the most common binding mode was selected as a starting binding mode for LTB4 in BLT1. This structure of LTB4 docked into BLT1 was subjected to minimization and in vacuo molecular dynamics allowing both the receptor binding pocket and the ligand to relax and attain stable conformations of lowest energies. A snake diagram depicting the primary sequence of BLT1 is shown in Fig. 1A. The residues identified as ligand contact points are marked in green. The structure of LTB4 bound to BLT1 is shown in Fig. 1B. The ligand binding site of BLT1 is composed of ECL2 and TMs III, V, and VI, and the hydrophobic ligand penetrates deep into the transmembrane domains. The three nodes of polar regions in the ligand are countered by corresponding polar residues in the receptor. A clear ligand binding pocket is visible in the surface rendering of the LTB4 binding site of BLT1 (Fig. 1C). LTB4 Interaction with Residues in TM Domains—The hydrophobic nature of the ligand suggested a deep seated pocket within BLT1. Analysis of the ligand-bound structure identified several potential contact points in the TMs: His-94 and Tyr-102 (TM III), Glu-185 (TM V), and Asn-241 (TM VI), whereas the polar head group was oriented toward ECL2 (Fig. 2A). Both Glu-185 (TM V) and Tyr-102 (TM III) stabilize LTB4 binding by direct hydrogen bonding with the C5′ hydroxyl group as well as with each other, whereas Asn-241 (TM VI) hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group on C12′ of LTB4 at the base of the binding pocket. His-94 likely interacts with the C5′-hydroxyl of LTB4 via hydrogen bonding. To validate these interactions, receptor variants were generated by mutagenesis. Amino acid residues His-94, Tyr-102, Asn-241, and Glu-185 were mutated to alanine in a combination of single and double mutants. All these receptor variants were stably expressed to similar levels as single cell derived lines on the surface of 300.19 cells (Fig. 2B). All the mutants displayed reduced levels of binding as determined by both competition and saturation binding assays (Fig. 2, C-E, and Table 1). The four single mutants H94A, Y102A, N241A, and E185A displayed reduced binding affinity of 4- to 9-fold in competition binding and 6- to 15-fold in saturation binding assays (Table 1). Surface expression as measured by flow cytometry or as Bmax in saturation binding assays also showed that all mutants are expressed at comparable or higher levels relative to BLT1 (Table 1). The Y102A/N241A double mutant showed a synergistic reduction in binding affinity in [3H]LTB4 binding assays (Fig. 2E and Table 1). LTB4 activates a variety of cellular responses, including chemotaxis (14Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), calcium mobilization, and ligand-induced phosphorylation and desensitization (39Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Consistent with the reduction in binding, all the mutants showed a shift in dose response of chemotaxis (Fig. 2F) while retaining the bell-shaped nature of the response. The Y102A/N241A double mutant required 100 times more LTB4 for reaching the maximum response. Analysis of ligand-induced calcium mobilization also showed a clear shift in dose response with each of these mutants (Fig. 3). The Y102A, H94A, and N241A mutants and the Y102A/N241A double mutants reached similar levels of maximum activity but at much higher concentrations than the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3). A summary of"
https://openalex.org/W2068467915,"The results of a number of recent studies show that mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents are substantially elevated, however, the effect of parental genotype on transgenerational instability remains poorly understood. Here, we have analysed the mutation frequency at an expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus in the germline and bone marrow of the first-generation male offspring of control and irradiated male mice. The frequency of ESTR mutation was studied in the offspring of two reciprocal matings ♂scid × ♀BALB/c and ♂BALB/c × ♀scid, which were compared with that in BALB/c mice. In the offspring of the BALB/c × BALB/c and ♂scid × ♀BALB/c matings, which were conceived after paternal sperm irradiation, the frequency of ESTR mutation was significantly elevated in both tissues. In contrast, ESTR mutation frequency was only slightly elevated in the offspring of ♂BALB/c × ♀scid mating conceived after paternal irradiation. The results of this study suggest that the oocytes of scid females are unable to fully support the repair of double-strand breaks induced in paternal sperm which may in turn result in the elimination of cells/embryos containing high levels of DNA damage, thus partially preventing the manifestation of genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W2049202455,"The p53 tumour suppressor is regulated mainly by Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the ubiquitylation and proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Many agents that induce p53 are inhibitors of transcription, suggesting that the p53 pathway can detect a signal(s) arising from transcriptional malfunction. Mdm2 associates with TAFII250, a component of the general transcription factor TFIID. Inactivation of TAFII250 in ts13 cells, which express a temperature-sensitive mutant of TAFII250, leads to the induction of p53 and cell cycle arrest. In the present study, we show that TAFII250 stimulates the ubiquitylation and degradation of p53 in a manner that is dependent upon Mdm2 and requires its acidic domain. Mechanistically, TAFII250 downregulates Mdm2 auto-ubiquitylation, leading to Mdm2 stabilization, and promotes p53-Mdm2 association through a recently defined second binding site in the acidic domain of Mdm2. These data provide a novel route through which TAFII250 can directly influence p53 levels and are consistent with the idea that the maintenance of p53 turnover is coupled to the integrity of RNA polymerase II transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1974133930,"Human clinical neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and type 2 (NF2) result from mutations and inactivation of neurofibromin and merlin genes, respectively, which negatively regulate Ras pathways. To evaluate the contribution of N-Ras activity to the development of NF, we generated a novel transgenic mouse expressing oncogenic N-ras specifically in central nerve cells, neural crest-derived cells and lens epithelial cells. Soon after birth, the mouse skin showed hyperpigmentation of the epidermis and melanin-laden macrophages in the dermis, as observed in the café-au-lait spots of human cases. At 3 months of age, all the mice had neurofibromas in the skin and neurofibroma-like tumors with structure similar to Wagner–Meissner bodies in the adrenal medulla. At 4 months of age, all the mice developed subcapsular cataract. In the 5th month, some developed protruding dermal neurofibromas involving subcutaneous fat. However, plexiform neurofibroma, schwannoma, astrocytoma and pheochromocytoma were not observed in the mice, suggesting a requirement for signal(s) other than the activated N-Ras pathway to induce these tumors. Thus, the activated N-Ras signal may be a main pathway for the development of the disease phenotypes characteristic of NF."
https://openalex.org/W2039808232,"The multi-functional protein c-Cbl is an important modulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics in diverse biological systems. We had previously reported that c-Cbl facilitates cell spreading and adhesion and suppresses anchorage-independent growth of v-Abl-transformed fibroblasts. To assess the importance of membrane localization of c-Cbl for the observed effects of c-Cbl in v-Abl-3T3 cells, we first mapped the membrane interactive domain(s) of c-Cbl. Our studies indicate that localization of c-Cbl to the membrane is likely to be mediated by the tyrosine kinase binding (TKB) domain and the proline-rich region of c-Cbl, whereas C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation does not play a role. The association of v-Cbl, which encompasses the TKB domain, with the membrane was unusual as it was not entirely dependent on SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. Our studies further demonstrate that Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP), which binds to v-Cbl in a tyrosine phosphorylation-independent manner, facilitates membrane association of Cbl. The interaction between c-Cbl and SLAP in v-Abl-3T3 cells positively influenced c-Cbl-mediated spreading and adhesion of these cells. SLAP appears to exert its effects not simply by increasing the amount of c-Cbl in the membrane but by facilitating binding of p85-phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with membrane-associated c-Cbl."
