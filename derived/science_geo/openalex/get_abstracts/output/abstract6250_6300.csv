https://openalex.org/W2055029884,Injections of rabbit antiserum to rat lymphocytes reversed hyperglycemia in 36 percent of spontaneously diabetic rats (Bio Breeding/Worcester) and prevented diabetes in susceptible nondiabetic controls. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that cell-mediated autoimmunity plays a role in the pathogenesis of diabetes in this animal model that mimics many morphologic and physiologic characteristics of human insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

The reaction goes to completion and requires ATP for the production of mature sequence tRNA. In the absence of ATP, half-tRNA molecules accumulate. Similar half-tRNA molecules appear as kinetic intermediates and accumulate if splicing is inhibited with pure, mature tRNA. Half-tRNA molecules have been purified. These half-tRNAs are efficiently ligated in an ATP-dependent reaction that is inhibited by added mature tRNA. The product of ligation is the expected mature sequence tRNA. The excised intervening sequence has also been identified. These results suggest an enzymatic mechanism for splicing which involves two independent steps."

The DNA sequences of the two segments have been used to deduce the primary and secondary structures of the tRNA. The threonine tRNA is unusual in having a leucine anticodon (3'-GAU-5'). Despite the anomalous anticodon, the tRNA is proposed to function in mitochondrial protein synthesis. One of the rho- clones contains an additional coding sequence that has been identified as a valine tRNA genes have been located on the wild-type physical map and determined to be transcribed from two different strands."
https://openalex.org/W1497895596,"An activity, RNase E, was purified about 100-fold from Escherichia coli cells, it can process p5 rRNA from a 9 S RNA molecule which accumulates in a mutant of E. coli defective in the maturation of 5 S rRNA. The enzyme requires Na+, K+, or NH4+, and Mg2+ or Mn2+. The molecular weight of the enzyme is about 70,000 and its pH optimum is 7.6 to 8.0. Its temperature optimum is around 30 degrees C, and it can be irreversibly inactivated at 50 degrees C. It has a very high degree of specificity but the reaction can be inhibited by nonspecific RNAs. We interpret its mode of action in producing p5 RNA as being accomplished in two steps, 9 S RNA is first processed to 7 S and 4 S, and subsequently 7 S is further processed to p5."
https://openalex.org/W1594552382,"Using small angle x-ray scattering from solutions of yeast phosphoglycerate kinase, we have measured the radius of gyration of the enzyme both in the presence and in the abscence of ligands. We find that the radius of gyration decreases by 1.09 +/- 0.34 A upon binding both substrates MgATP and 3-phosphoglycerate to form the ternary complex. Smaller decreases, at the limit of the precision of the measurement, were found for the separate binding of MgATP (0.30 +/- 0.50 A). Using computer modeling, it has been estimated that a substrate-induced cleft closure in phosphoglycerate kinase resulting from one lobe rotating 8-14 degrees relative to the other lobe lobe is consistent with this observed change in radius of gyration. We suggest, therefore, that the conformational change that results in the smaller radius of gyration for the ternary complex is a hinge motion of the two lobes which produces a closing of the cleft between the two lobes. The apparent similarity of the ligand-induced change in phosphoglycerate kinase to the cleft closure in hexokinase suggests that this kind of conformational change may prove to be a rather general kinase phenomenon (Bennett, W.S., and Steitz T.A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 4848-4852; Anderson, C.M., Zucker, F.H., and Steitz, T.A. (1979) Science 204, 375-380)."
https://openalex.org/W2011466021,"The intermediates of the yeast tRNA splicing reaction have been characterized. The intervening sequence is excised as an unique linear molecule. It has 5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphate termini. Correspondingly, the half-tRNA molecules are shown to have a 3'-phosphate terminus on the 5' half and 5'-hydroxyl terminus on the 3' half. These isolated halves have been shown to be active in the ligation step of tRNA splicing. Removal of the 3'-phosphate from the 5' half eliminates the ability of the 5' half to participate in ligation."

https://openalex.org/W2149358327,"Certain tRNAs in S. cerevisiae (tRNATyr and tRNAPhe) arise via precursor molecules which are mature at the 5′ and 3′ termini but contain intervening sequences adjacent to the anticodon ( Knapp et al., 1978 Knapp G. Beckmann J.S. Johnson P.F. Fuhrman S.A. Abelson J. Transcription and processing of intervening sequences in yeast tRNA genes. Cell. 1978; 14: 221-236 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar ; O'Farrell et al., 1978 O'Farrell P.Z. Cordell B. Valenzuela P. Rutter W.J. Goodman H.M. Structure and processing of yeast precursor tRNAs containing intervening sequences. Nature. 1978; 274: 438-445 Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar ). In addition to these molecules, precursors to several other tRNAs accumulate in a temperature-sensitive mutant (ts136) at the nonpermissive temperature. We have analyzed one of these species and shown that it is a precursor to a minor species of tRNASer. This precursor is also mature at both termini and contains an intervening sequence of 19 nucleotides adjacent to the hypermodified A residue 3′ to the anticodon. The sequence can be arranged in a secondary structure in which the anticodon stem is extended by additional base-pairing, and contains the sites of excision and ligation within two looped regions. Support for this structure was provided by analysis of the products of limited digestion with RNAase T1. Recently Piper, 1978 Piper P. A correlation between a recessive lethal amber suppressor mutation in S. cerevisiae and an anticodon change in a minor serine tRNA. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 217-235 Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar reported the isolation of a minor species of tRNASer which decodes UCG. He found this species to be structurally heterogeneous and determined that the less abundant form corresponds to the tRNA which is altered in the recessive lethal SUP-RL1 amber suppressor. Our data now suggest that the more abundant form may be restricted to reading UCA in vivo; thus mutation of the minor species would result in complete loss of UCG-decoding ability and explain the recessive lethality of SUP-RL1. We have shown that the precursor which accumulates in ts136 corresponds exclusively to this minor tRNAUCGSer species. Our results suggest that this may be the only gene for tRNASer in yeast which contains an intervening sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2143023044,"The binding of secretory component (SC) to epithelial cells and its role in the specific uptake of immunoglobulin A (IgA) dimer has been studied in rabbit mammary gland and liver. SC, Mr approximately 80,000, secreted by epithelial cells of the mammary gland was found associated with the cell surface of mammary cells in intact tissue. Dispersed mammary cells and plasma membrane-enriched fractions obtained from mammary glands of midpregnant rabbits bound 125I-labeled SC in a saturable time- and temperature-dependent process. The association rate followed a second order reversible reaction (k+1 approximately equal to 2.7 x 10(6) M-1 min-1 at 4 degrees C) and equilibrium was reached in about 4 h at 4 degrees C. The dissociation rate for membranes was first order (k-1 approximately equal to 1.7 x 10(-2) min-1 at 4 degrees C), whereas displacement from cells was incomplete. The apparent affinity constant was similar for membranes and cells (Ka approximately equal to 5 x 10(8) M-1) with one class of binding sites. The number of binding sites varied from one animal to another (260 to 7,000 sites/mammary cell) in relation to endogenous occupancy by SC, which was assessed by immunocytochemistry and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Rabbit liver and heart membranes did not bind SC, and serum proteins present in rabbit milk failed to interact with mammary cells or membranes. Mammary membranes or cells and liver membranes bound 125I-labeled IgA dimer in a saturable, reversible time- and temperature-dependent process. Association and dissociation rate constants at 4 degrees C (k+1 approximately equal to 5 x 10(6) M-1 min-1 and k-1 approximately equal to 5 x 10(-3) min-1, respectively) and the apparent affinity constant (Ka approximately equal to 10(9) M-1) were similar for liver and mammary membranes; these parameters differed, however, from those reported for free SC-IgA dimer interaction. The binding capacity of membranes for IgA dimer was directly related to the amount of free SC bound to membranes. Interaction of IgA dimer with mammary or liver membranes or cells was abrogated by excess of free SC and was prevented by preincubation of membranes or cells with Fab antibody fragments directed against SC. These data indicate that the first step in the translocation process of polymeric immunoglobulins across epithelia consists of binding of SC to the surface of epithelial cells which in turn acts as a receptor for the specific uptake of IgA dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1641219603,"Bacteriophage fd gene II-protein was characterized as an endonuclease which specifically nicked supercoiled replicative form (RF) of filamentous phages in the viral strand. No other supercoiled DNAs tested were attacked by the enzyme, nor were doubly closed fd RF in the relaxed state nor phage fd single strands. Maximal activity was found at pH 8.5 and 80 mM KCl using fd RFI of physiological superhelicity. Mg2+, but no other cofactor, was required for the cleavage reaction. A sealing activity was found to be associated with the enzyme. At a higher concentration of Mg2+ up to 40% of the reaction products were found as doubly closed relaxed fd RF. The protein was not found to be tightly attached to the cleaved strand."
https://openalex.org/W20166623,"The polymorphic mitochondrial translation product varl has been analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by proteolytic cleavage of the radiolabeled product. Different apparent molecular weight forms of varl ranging between 40,000 and 44,000 show “normal” migration behavior as a function of the acrylamide concentration on sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gels. Comparisons of peptide fragment patterns generated by digestion of different molecular weight forms of varl with papain and a protease from Staphylococcus aureus V8 show considerable fragment homology; some partial fragments retain the molecular weight differences of the undigested product; others shown no homology and suggest the presence of unique cleavage sites. Analysis on a two-dimensional system consisting of electrophoresis in the first dimension on acid-urea gels (Mets, L., and Bogorad, L., (1974) Anal. Biochem. 57, 200-220) and in the second dimension on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, show that varl behaves as a basic protein migrating between the cytoplasmic large subunit ribosomal proteins L2 and L3. Varl is the only major labeled polypeptide species to be resolved in this two dimensional gel system when cells are labeled with 3sS042- in uiuo in the presence of cycloheximide. By analyzing yeast strains containing different molecular weight forms of varl, we show that the protein is specifically associated with the 38 S mi- tochondrial ribosomal subunit. By Coomassie blue staining, it appears to be present in amounts roughly equivalent to the other proteins of the 38 S subunit and may be an integral ribosomal protein since it is not removed by a high salt wash. When cells are labeled in viva with 35S042- in the absence of inhibitors, most, if not all, of the varl is associated with the 38 S subunit. Between 20% and 80% of the varl can be found in the postmitochondrial supernatant fraction. Marker en- zyme distribution studies suggest that this “extra mi- tochondrial” varl is released by mechanical damage of the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1487664955,"Methylcholanthrene-transformed mouse fibroblasts synthesize prostaglandins in response to bradykinin, thrombin, serum, and the ionophore A23187. These agents activate phospholipases, thereby releasing fatty acids from phospholipids. To examine the phospholipid specificity of the phospholipases activated by bradykinin, thrombin, serum, and A23187, cells were labeled with [14C]arachidonic acid and stimulated with these agents in the presence of delipidated bovine serum albumin. Phospholipid classes were resolved by two-dimensional chromatography on silica gel-coated paper. Only phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine lost radioactivity upon stimulation. To characterize the fatty acid specificity of the phospholipases, cells were incubated with 14C-labeled stearic, oleic, linoleic, eicosatrienoic, or arachidonic acid and then exposed to the stimuli. Bradykinin, thrombin, and serum caused specific release of radioactivity into the medium only from cells labeled with arachidonic acid or eicosatrienoic acid, whereas A23187 caused release from cells labeled with any one of the five fatty acids. We conclude that bradykinin, thrombin, and serum activate phospholipases that specifically hydrolyze arachidonyl and eicosatrienoyl phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine, whereas A23187 is less specific activator of phospholipases."

https://openalex.org/W1622586190,"A new class of fluorescent nucleotide analogs which contain the fluorophore 1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonate attached via a gamma-phosphoamidate bond has been synthesized. Both the purine and pyrimidine analogs have fluorescence emission maxima at 460 nm. Cleavage of the alpha-beta-phosphoryl bond produces change in both the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. The fluorescence of the pyrimidine analogs is quenched; cleavage of the alpha-beta-phosphoryl bond of the UTP analog produces about a 14-fold increase in fluorescence intensity at 500 nm. Under the same conditions the fluorescence of the CTP analog increases about 8-fold, whereas the fluorescence of the purine analogs shows only a slight change. These derivatives are good substrates for Escherichia coli RNA polymerase with only slightly increased Km values and with Vmax values about 50 to 70% that of the normal nucleotides. They are used less efficiently by wheat germ RNA polymerase II. The ATP analog can be used by E. coli RNA polymerase to initiate RNA chains."
https://openalex.org/W2052403858,"An in vitro replication system has been used to study the control of DNA replication of the relaxed plasmids Col E1 and RSF1030. An RNA transcript approximately 100 nucleotides long is synthesized during the in vitro DNA replication reaction. This RNA is synthesized approximately 450 bp away from the origin of replication. A small insertion in the coding sequence for the RNA made from Col E1 DNA leads to a larger RNA species and simultaneously to an increase in plasmid copy number. Revertants missing the specific insertion show shorter RNA transcripts and wild-type copy number. Although plasmids Col E1 and RSF1030 have no extensive sequence homology, the RNA synthesized during RSF1030 replication has almost the same mobility as the Col E1 RNA on polyacrylamide gels and hybridizes to the Col E1 origin region. Extracts prepared from mutants of Escherichia coli deficient in ribonuclease III do not replicate RSF1030 or Col E1 plasmids in vitro. When supplemented with homogeneous RNAase III, such extracts do support DNA replication on these templates, indicating that RNAase III is required for DNA replication. We propose that the 100 nucleotide RNA species is involved in regulating the initiation of DNA replication of these plasmids, and that RNAase III may be involved in processing this RNA."

https://openalex.org/W139870775,"The role of calcium in regulating the Na+ channel in an established kidney epithelial cell line has been examined. Extracellular calcium was inhibitory to Na+ uptake, and a Dixon plot of the initial Na+ uptake rate in the presence of Ca2+ was nonlinear, suggesting a mixed pattern of inhibition. Similar patterns of inhibition were also observed for other divalent cations, including Ba2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. In contrast elevated concentrations of intracellular calcium resulted in a stimulation of Na+ entry. This intracellular effect was specific to calcium, with Mg2+ and Mn2+ appearing much less effective. Lineweaver-Burk plots of Na+ influx in calcium-loaded and unloaded cells were linear, suggesting that under both conditions a single system transported Na+. Although Na+ entry was stimulated by intracellular Ca2+, the cells did not exhibit other counter transport phenomena reported with cell types in which a Na+/Ca2+ exchange system is operative. Thus, the results indicate that calcium acts as an allosteric regulator of Na+ transport by the Na+ channel."

The sequence was deduced from automatic and manual sequence analysis of the intact protein, the fragments produced by cyanogen bromide cleavage, and peptides derived from the largest cyanogen bromide fragment by digestion with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteus, chymotrypsin, and Lysobacter enzymogenes alpha-lytic protease. The complete sequence comprises 78 residues in a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 8444. No evidence of heterogeneity was obtained, indicating that all subunits of the native enzyme are identical. Comparison of the sequence with that of all known dihydrofolate reductases shows no significant sequence homology."

https://openalex.org/W1526866683,"Bacteriophage T7-induced DNA polymerase has been isolated by a procedure suitable for large scale use and which yields near homogeneous enzyme. In addition to previously described DNA polymerase activity and 3' to 5' exonucleolytic activity on single stranded DNA (Grippo, P., and Richardson, C. C. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 6867-6873), the enzyme also possesses a highly active exonuclease which hydrolyzes duplex substrates with 3' to 5' directionality. The native polymerase has been dissociated using 6 M guanidine HCl and resolved into biologically active subunits: T7 gene 5 protein and Escherichia coli thioredoxin. The phage-specified subunit obtained by this procedure is deficient in DNA polymerase and double strand exonuclease activities, with deficiencies in these activities being apparent at the level of a single turnover. However, it possesses near normal levels of a single strand hydrolytic activity which is identical to that associated with the native polymerase with respect to substrate specificity and suppression of hydrolysis by low levels of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates. Thioredoxin forms a molecular complex with the T7 gene 5 protein, and addition of the host protein restores restores DNA polymerase and double strand exonuclease activities to near normal levels."

Four hundred colonies carrying yeast tRNA genes were isolated. By hybridization to 125I-tRNALeu3, we have isolated from this collection 14 colonies carrying fragments containing yeast tRNALeu genes. The size of the yeast Bam HI inserts ranged from 2.45 x 10(6) to 14 x 10(6) daltons. One of these fragments was mapped in detail by restriction endonuclease digestion and hybridization to 125I-tRNALeu3. The presence of a tRNALeu3 gene was confirmed by DNA sequence. The results indicate that the tRNALeu3 coding region is not co-linear with the tRNALeu3. An intervening tract of 33 base pairs interrupts the coding sequences 1 base pair past the anticodon coding region.

https://openalex.org/W1555625531,"We have studied the circular dichroism and ultraviolet difference spectra of T7 bacteriophage DNA and various synthetic polynucleotides upon addition of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. When RNA polymerase binds nonspecifically to T7 DNA, the CD spectrum shows a decrease in the maximum at 272 but no detectable changes in other regions of the spectrum. This CD change can be compared with those associated with known conformational changes in DNA. Nonspecific binding to RNA polymerase leads to an increase in the winding angle, theta, in T7 DNA. The CD and UV difference spectra for poly[d(A-T)] at 4 degrees C show similar effects. At 25 degrees C, binding of RNA polymerase to poly[d(A-T)] leads to hyperchromicity at 263 nm and to significant changes in CD. These effects are consistent with an opening of the double helix, i.e. melting of a short region of the DNA. The hyperchromicity observed at 263 nm for poly[d(A-T)] is used to determine the number of base pairs disrupted in the binding of RNA polymerase holoenzyme. The melting effect involves about 10 base pairs/RNA polymerase molecule. Changes in the CD of poly(dT) and poly(dA) on binding to RNA polymerase suggest an unstacking of the bases with a change in the backbone conformation. This is further confirmed by the UV difference spectra. We also show direct evidence for differences in the template binding site between holo- and core enzyme, presumably induced by the sigma subunit. By titration of the enzyme with poly(dT) the physical site size of RNA polymerase on single-stranded DNA is approximately equal to 30 bases for both holo- and core enzyme. Titration of poly[d(A-T)] with polymerase places the figure at approximately equal to 28 base pairs for double-stranded DNA."

https://openalex.org/W143830963,"DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 is composed of two subunits, the gene 5 protein of the phage and the host-specified thioredoxin. The gene 5 protein has been purified 7400-fold to homogeneity from bacteriophage T7-infected Escherichia coli 7400 trxA cells that lack thioredoxin. The purification procedure has been monitored by using a complementation assay in which thioredoxin interacts with the gene 5 protein to form an active DNA polymerase. The purified gene 5 protein is a single polypeptide having a molecular weight of 87,000. The gene 5 protein itself has only 1 to 2% of the polymerase activity of T7 DNA polymerase. However, T7 DNA polymerase can be reconstituted by the addition of homogeneous thioredoxin to the gene 5 protein. Optimal reconstitution is obtained when the molar ratio of thioredoxin/gene 5 protein is 150. Under these conditions, the gene 5 protein attains approximately 80% of the activity of an equal amount of T7 DNA polymerase. The apparent Km for thioredoxin in the reaction to restore DNA polymerase activity is 2.8 x 10(-8) M. The enzymatic properties of the reconstituted enzyme are indistinguishable from those of T7 DNA polymerase synthesized in vivo; the reconstituted polymerase interacts with T7 gene 4 protein to catalyze DNA synthesis on duplex DNA templates."
https://openalex.org/W1588224174,"Histidinol dehydrogenase and UDP-Glc dehydrogenase catalyze 4-electron dehydrogenations that convert primary alcohol groups to the corresponding acids. Both reactions proceed in two distinct steps involving the oxidation of the primary alcohol to a bound form of the intermediate aldehyde, followed by oxidation of this to the corresponding acid. The enzymes have subunit structure, the former is made up of two subunits and the latter of six (beef liver enzyme). Evidence is presented that the two half-reactions proceed independently of the overall reaction. Histidinol dehydrogenase preparations that approach total dissociation into subunits also approach total inhibition of the overall reaction, while the second half reaction is completely unaffected and 50% of the first half-reaction survives. Further, the fraction of overall activity surviving in partially dissociated preparations follows the weight fraction of residual dimer. UDP-Glc dehydrogenase behaves in an analogous fashion. These data are interpreted on the basis that both enzymes function by carrying out first oxidation step at a site on one subunit and then pass the intermediate to a vicinal site on the adjacent subunit, where the reaction is completed."

The protein is monomeric and has L-leucine as NH2-terminal amino acid. The intrinsic fluorescence of the protein is altered upon binding of substrate. At an excitation of 285 nm, the emission maximum at 340 nm is quenched and shifted to 330 nm. Binding of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate is reversible and no chemical alteration occurs with the substrate. The appearance of the binding protein in the periplasm is the result of a mutation that renders the cells constitutive for sn-glycerol 3-phosphate transport. Simultaneously, two other proteins appear in the periplasm. These proteins were also purified.

Depolarizing the Torpedo synaptosomes by a high K+ buffer or treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 result in Ca2+ uptake, in acetylcholine (ACh) release, and in a marked increase of 32P incorporation into a specific protein band with an apparent subunit molecular weight of 100,000 (band alpha). The kinetics of synaptosomal 45Ca2+ uptake, of 32P incorporation into band alpha, and of ACh release is similar and reach maximal values about 45 s after the synaptosomes have been treated. Sr2+ and Ba2+ can replace Ca2+ in evoking both K+ depolarization-dependent ACh release and 32P incorporation into band alpha. The effectiveness of these ions (Ca2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+) is similar in both cases. The data presented suggest that Ca2+ accumulation by Torpedo synaptosomes leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of a specific protein and to ACh release. This phosphoprotein may be involved in the regulation of presynaptic processes which underly ACh release."
https://openalex.org/W197740357,"A mutant form of aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) from Escherichiu coli which lacks catalytic activity has been purified from a strain which produces large quantities of the inactive protein. Analysis of hybrid enzymes composed of subunits from the mutant and wild type enzyme showed that the mutation was in the structural gene for the catalytic subunits. No alteration of the regulatory subunits was detected. The mutant enzyme had the same sedimentation coefficient, 11.7 S, as the wild type enzyme, and the molecular weights of the individual catalytic and regulatory polypeptide chains of the mutant enzyme evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were the same as the wild type enzyme. Amino acid analysis of the catalytic and regulatory subunits showed no differences, within 3% error, between the two forms of the enzyme. Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea indicated that the catalytic polypeptide chains of the mutant had a charge difference of -1 relative to those of the wild type enzyme. Ligand binding studies were performed by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy. Although the mutant catalytic subunit bound the substrate, carbamoylphosphate, the dissociation constant, 150 pM, was much greater than that for the wild type catalytic subunit, 9 pM. Neither the substrate analog, succinate, nor the bisubstrate analog, N-(phosphonacetyl)+aspartate (PALA), was bound by the mutant protein, whereas both of these ligands are bound with high affinity by the wild type enzyme. Preparations of the mutant enzyme do not contain a regulatory subunit-deficient species which is usually found in preparations of the wild type enzyme. Moreover, this species could not be generated by limited degradation of the mutant ATCase by mercurials nor by reconstitution of mutant enzyme from mixtures of catalytic and regulatory subunits with the former in excess.

https://openalex.org/W1542024391,The complete amino acid sequence of yeast proteinase B inhibitor 2 (IB2) was determined to be H3N+-Thr-Lys-Asn-Phe-Ile-Val-Thr-Leu-Lys-Lys-Asn-Thr-Pro-Asp-Val-Glu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Phe-Leu-Asp-Ser-Val-His-His-Ala-Gly-Gly-Ser-Ile-Leu-His-Glu-Phe-Asp-Ile-Ile-Lys-Gly-Tyr-Thr-Ile-Lys-Val-Pro-Asp-Val-Leu-His-Leu-Asn-Lys-Leu-Lys-Glu-Lys-His-Asn-Asp-Val-Ile-Glu-Asn-Val-Glu-Asp-Lys-Glu-Val-His-Thr-Asn-COO-. Elucidation of the primary structure was enabled by automated Edman degradation and COOH-terminal hydrolysis with carboxypeptidases A (bovine pancreas and Y (yeast). IB2 is the first proteinase inhibitor to be sequenced that possesses a structure devoid of disulfide bridges.

https://openalex.org/W2149036852,"Two ribonuclease H activities have been found in yeast RNA polymerase A. The nuclease activities comigrated with subunits A49 (Mr = 49,000) and A40 (Mr = 40,000), after electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel containing [32P](rG)n . (dC)n as substrate. Both activities were also found, among other nucleases, in a high salt chromatin extract. Several lines of evidence suggest that the chromatin RNase H of 49,000 daltons (RNase H49) is the same protein as subunit A49. They co-migrate on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, have the same chromatographic properties, and dissociate simultaneously from RNA polymerase A. Fractions containing RNase H49 stimulate RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase A* lacking A49 and A34.5 subunits. Finally, limited proteolysis of the protein band having RNase H49 activity yields the characteristic fingerprint of the A49 subunit. This subunit, therefore, exists in two states: bound to chromatin and associated with RNA polymerase A. On the other hand, it is not yet clear whether the RNase H activity of 40,000 daltons, associated with RNA polymerase A, is due to the A40 subunit or whether it represents a trace contamination by a very active nuclease tightly bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1498568015,"Ethoxyformic anhydride was used to demonstrate the existence of a second important histidine in succinyl-CoA synthetase from Escherichia coli. Differential labeling of the enzyme by [3H]ethoxyformic anhydride gave a stoichiometry of one important histidine per alpha beta catalytic unit. Data are presented suggesting that this residue and an important thiol group on the beta subunit (Collier, G., and Nishimura, J.S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4938-4943) interact with each other during catalysis. A mechanism of action involving these 2 residues is proposed for one of the partial reactions catalyzed by succinyl-CoA synthetase."
