https://openalex.org/W4253453051,"Three-dimensional (3D) movement of neuroprosthetic devices can be controlled by the activity of cortical neurons when appropriate algorithms are used to decode intended movement in real time. Previous studies assumed that neurons maintain fixed tuning properties, and the studies used subjects who were unaware of the movements predicted by their recorded units. In this study, subjects had real-time visual feedback of their brain-controlled trajectories. Cell tuning properties changed when used for brain-controlled movements. By using control algorithms that track these changes, subjects made long sequences of 3D movements using far fewer cortical units than expected. Daily practice improved movement accuracy and the directional tuning of these units."
https://openalex.org/W2019493938,"Recent advances in statistical mechanical theory can be used to solve a fundamental problem in experimental thermodynamics. In 1997, Jarzynski proved an equality relating the irreversible work to the equilibrium free energy difference, Δ G . This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski's equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the Δ G profile of the stretching process to within k B T /2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski's equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. This work also extends the thermodynamic analysis of single molecule manipulation data beyond the context of equilibrium experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2095710420,"Ice flow at a location in the equilibrium zone of the west-central Greenland Ice Sheet accelerates above the midwinter average rate during periods of summer melting. The near coincidence of the ice acceleration with the duration of surface melting, followed by deceleration after the melting ceases, indicates that glacial sliding is enhanced by rapid migration of surface meltwater to the ice-bedrock interface. Interannual variations in the ice acceleration are correlated with variations in the intensity of the surface melting, with larger increases accompanying higher amounts of summer melting. The indicated coupling between surface melting and ice-sheet flow provides a mechanism for rapid, large-scale, dynamic responses of ice sheets to climate warming."
https://openalex.org/W2000985786,"The coagulant and inflammatory exacerbation in sepsis is counterbalanced by the protective protein C (PC) pathway. Activated PC (APC) was shown to use the endothelial cell PC receptor (EPCR) as a coreceptor for cleavage of protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1) on endothelial cells. Gene profiling demonstrated that PAR1 signaling could account for all APC-induced protective genes, including the immunomodulatory monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which was selectively induced by activation of PAR1, but not PAR2. Thus, the prototypical thrombin receptor is the target for EPCR-dependent APC signaling, suggesting a role for this receptor cascade in protection from sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2010817360,"Monocytes and macrophages express cytokines and procoagulant molecules in various inflammatory diseases. In sepsis, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria induces tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and tissue factor (TF) in monocytic cells via the activation of the transcription factors Egr-1, AP-1, and nuclear factor-kappa B. However, the signaling pathways that negatively regulate LPS-induced TNF-alpha and TF expression in monocytic cells are currently unknown. We report that inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway enhances LPS-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) and the downstream targets AP-1 and Egr-1. In addition, inhibition of PI3K-Akt enhanced LPS-induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B and prevented Akt-dependent inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-beta, which increased the transactivational activity of p65. We propose that the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in human monocytes limits the LPS induction of TNF-alpha and TF expression. Our study provides new insight into the inhibitory mechanism by which the PI3K-Akt pathway ensures transient expression of these potent inflammatory mediators."
https://openalex.org/W2070119451,"Nucleation of branched actin filaments by the Arp2/3 complex is a conserved process in eukaryotic cells, yet the source of unbranched actin filaments has remained obscure. In yeast, formins stimulate assembly of actin cables independently of Arp2/3. Here, the conserved core of formin homology domains 1 and 2 of Bni1p (Bni1pFH1FH2) was found to nucleate unbranched actin filaments in vitro. Bni1pFH2 provided the minimal region sufficient for nucleation. Unique among actin nucleators, Bni1pFH1FH2 remained associated with the growing barbed ends of filaments. This combination of properties suggests a direct role for formins in regulating nucleation and polarization of unbranched filamentous actin structures."
https://openalex.org/W1986501756,"The use of direct-write dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) to generate covalently anchored, nanoscale patterns of oligonucleotides on both metallic and insulating substrates is described. Modification of DNA with hexanethiol groups allowed patterning on gold, and oligonucleotides bearing 5′-terminal acrylamide groups could be patterned on derivatized silica. Feature sizes ranging from many micrometers to less than 100 nanometers were achieved, and the resulting patterns exhibited the sequence-specific binding properties of the DNA from which they were composed. The patterns can be used to direct the assembly of individual oligonucleotide-modified particles on a surface, and the deposition of multiple DNA sequences in a single array is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1990458269,"T cell immune responses begin within organized lymphoid tissues. The pace, topology, and outcomes of the cellular interactions that underlie these responses have, so far, been inferred from static imaging of sectioned tissue or from studies of cultured cells. Here we report dynamic visualization of antigen-specific T cells interacting with dendritic cells within intact explanted lymph nodes. We observed immunological synapse formation and prolonged interactions between these two cell types, followed by the activation, dissociation, and rapid migration of T cells away from the antigenic stimulus. This high-resolution spatiotemporal analysis provides insight into the nature of cell interactions critical to early immune responses within lymphoid structures."

https://openalex.org/W2022471909,"HIF-1α is a normally labile proangiogenic transcription factor that is stabilized and activated in hypoxia. Although the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene product, the ubiquitin ligase responsible for regulating HIF-1α protein levels, efficiently targets HIF-1α for rapid proteasome-dependent degradation under normoxia, HIF-1α is resistant to the destabilizing effects of VHL under hypoxia. HIF-1α also associates with the molecular chaperone Hsp90. To examine the role of Hsp90 in HIF-1α function, we used renal carcinoma cell (RCC) lines that lack functional VHL and express stable HIF-1α protein under normoxia. Geldanamycin (GA), an Hsp90 antagonist, promoted efficient ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation of HIF-1α in RCC in both normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, HIF-1α point mutations that block VHL association did not protect HIF-1α from GA-induced destabilization. Hsp90 antagonists also inhibited HIF-1α transcriptional activity and dramatically reduced both hypoxia-induced accumulation of VEGF mRNA and hypoxia-dependent angiogenic activity. These findings demonstrate that disruption of Hsp90 function 1) promotes HIF-1α degradation via a novel, oxygen-independent E3 ubiquitin ligase and 2) diminishes HIF-1α transcriptional activity. Existence of an Hsp90-dependent pathway for elimination of HIF-1α predicts that Hsp90 antagonists may be hypoxic cell sensitizers and possess antiangiogenic activityin vivo, thus extending the utility of these drugs as therapeutic anticancer agents.

Because HIF-1α regulates a variety of processes such as angiogenesis and glucose metabolism, it is acknowledged to be a critically important tumor cell survival factor that is required for tumorigenesis in many cancer models and is expressed in a majority of metastases and late stage tumors. The rapid degradation of HIF-1α in normoxic cells is mediated by the tumor suppressor VHL, which, together with a multimeric protein complex, serves as its E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (2Iwai K.

Under hypoxic conditions, the stabilization and activation of HIF-1α is due to an inability of VHL to associate with and ubiquitinate HIF-1α. It was recently shown that hypoxic conditions impair the ability of a class of enzymes termed prolyl hydroxylases to modify two separate consensus proline motifs present on HIF-1α (6Bruick R.K.

These modifications are required for VHL to associate with and ubiquitinate HIF-1α, thereby targeting the protein for proteasome-dependent degradation. HIF-1α is constitutively stabilized in normoxic tumors and in cell lines that are VHL null or that express a nonfunctional mutant form of VHL. This occurs in over 50% of sporadic RCCs and clear cell RCCs (11Wiesener M.S. Munchenhagen P.M. Berger I. Morgan N.V. Roigas J. Schwiertz A. Jurgensen J.S. Gruber G. Maxwell P.H. Loning S.A. Frei U.

RCC lines: Caki-1 cells were obtained from ATCC; UMRC2 were provided by Dr. M. I. Lerman (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD); UMRC6 were obtained from Dr. B. Zbar (NCI, Frederick, MD); and 786-O were provided by Dr. R. Klausner (NCI, Bethesda, MD). The designations herein of C2 and C6 refer to UMRC2 and UMRC6. All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1× nonessential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were treated, as indicated, with the following agents: 50 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLnL, Sigma Chemical Co.), 2 μm geldanamycin (GA), and 2 μm 17-allylamino-17-desmethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (both obtained from NCI), 40 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX, Sigma), 5 μm PS-341 (Millennium Pharmaceuticals), and 100 μm cobalt chloride (Sigma). Cells were placed in a 37 °C pre-equilibrated Bactron II sealed chamber (Sheldon Labs), and premixed gas (94% N2, 5% CO2, 1% O2), was infused to create a hypoxic environment. The oxygen content inside the chamber was constantly monitored by a previously calibrated oxygen sensor (Animas Corp., Frazer, PA). Cells were manipulated and lysed inside the chamber, and all buffers were pre-equilibrated to 1% O2. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and overlaid for 10 min with low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA) containing protease inhibitors. The cells were then scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, and 10% Nonidet P-40 was added (final concentration 0.5%). The tubes were vigorously vortexed for 10 s and spun at 3000 rpm for 1 min, and nuclear pellets were washed with low salt buffer prior to lysis in high salt lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA). A CMV-driven HA-tagged HIF-1α construct was originally obtained from Dr. D. Livingston (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Using primers containing sites for BamHI (5′) and NotI (3′), this insert was PCR-amplified, subcloned into PCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and confirmed by sequencing. This latter construct was used for all wt HIF-1α transfections and as a template for subsequent mutations. To make site-specific mutations, complementary primers containing desired point mutations were constructed, and PCR amplification was performed in accordance with Promega's XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. For transfection, cells were seeded at 60% confluency 24 h prior to transfection, and 3 μg of plasmid DNA was used per 10-cm dish. Transfections were carried out using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Following cell lysis and clarification by centrifugation, equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 7.5% PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used: murine HIF-1α, 1:300 (Transduction labs); murine HA, 1:2000 (Covance); rat Hsp90, 1:2000 (Stressgen); murine topoisomerase II, 1:500 (Sigma); and rabbit polyclonal ubiquitin, 1:1000 (Sigma). For protein visualization, horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies were used with the ECL protein detection system (Pierce). For HA immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with HA-conjugated Sepharose beads (Covance) and for HIF-1α immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with HIF-1α antibody, followed by addition of protein G-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen). To detect HIF-1α/Hsp90 association, a low detergent (0.1% Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer was used and 20 mmNa2MoO4 was added to stabilize protein interactions. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and processed as described. Logarithmically growing UMRC2 cells were starved 30 min in methionine and cysteine-free media (Invitrogen) and 150 μCi/ml methionine/cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN) was added for 1 h. After the labeling period, cells were washed with nonradioactive complete medium and incubated in this medium for the indicated times. The cells were then lysed and precleared with protein G beads, and HIF-1α was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of soluble lysed protein overnight. For GA-treated samples, 2 μm GA was added to the starve medium, retained throughout the labeling period, and included in the chase medium. Densitometric analysis was performed, and the values (expressed as a fraction of the unchased control) were plotted semi-logarithmically. Cells were cotransfected with 0.4 μg of iNOS-luciferase plasmid DNA (kindly provided by Dr. G Melillo, NCI, Frederick, MD), containing three HIF-1α-responsive elements (HREs), and 4 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid DNA, which served as an internal control. Luciferase activities were measured and normalized to the Renilla activity. The data represent the means of three separate experiments. Cells were grown to ∼70% confluency and subjected to the appropriate treatments, and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer's specifications (Qiagen RNeasy mini kit). Aliquots of 15 μg of RNA were lyophilized and resuspended in formaldehyde loading dye (Ambion). The gels were run and transferred by capillary diffusion onto a nylon membrane. RNA was cross-linked to the membrane with ultraviolet light, prehybridized 6 h with ready-made buffer (Ambion) to which 0.2 mg/ml sheared salmon sperm was added, and hybridized overnight. The membranes were then washed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion) and exposed to film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The VEGF165 probe was kindly provided by Dr. Shi-Yuan Cheng (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) as plasmid DNA. The 0.6-kb insert was removed by digestion withBamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified (Qiaex II extraction kit, Qiagen), and radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using the Decaprime kit (Ambion), and 2 × 106 cpm/ml was used in hybridization reactions. Caki-1 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates (3 × 106 cells/plate) and, 24 h later, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-supplied with serum-free medium. The plates were then placed under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 12 h, and 0.5 μm GA was added to the treated plate at the time of hypoxia induction. Following the 12-h incubation, conditioned medium was removed and centrifuged twice in succession through Centricon filters (YM3, Millipore) to remove any traces of GA. The molecular mass cutoff of the filters was 3 kDa; the molecular mass of GA is 0.56 kDa, so the flow-through containing excess GA was discarded and the retentate was collected. Because GA itself may have an inhibitory effect on this assay, we confirmed that this approach efficiently removed GA from conditioned medium by subjecting media preparations containing known concentrations of GA to filtration and measuring the drug remaining in the retentate by high-performance liquid chromatography, as previously described (52Agnew E.B. Wilson R.H. Grem J.L. Neckers L., Bi, D. Takimoto C.H. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Sci. Appl. 2001; 755: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was determined that the amount of GA remaining after two successive filtration spins was negligible when the starting concentration did not exceed 0.5 μm. The final filter retentate was concentrated 3-fold for use in the angiogenesis assay. For the angiogenesis assay, a modified aortic ring method (80Kruger E.A. Figg W.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1867-1872PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Briefly, aortic rings were prepared from 13-day-old chicken embryos. Each aortic ring was placed in the center of a well and overlaid with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and growth factor-free human endothelial-SFM basal growth medium (Invitrogen) to which a 1:1 volume of cellular serum-free conditioned media was added. For a positive control, 10 nm bFGF was added, while basal medium alone was used as a negative control. In addition, filtered conditioned medium from GA-treated cells was added to the positive control to ensure that potential trace amounts of GA were not inhibitory in this assay. The aortic rings were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 36 h in the presence of conditioned medium, and microvessels sprouting from the aortic rings were photographed with an inverted microscope. All conditions were performed in duplicate. In each case, the degree of angiogenesis was normalized to the area of the corresponding ring. For relative comparison, the degree of angiogenesis for each condition was normalized to the negative control. GA mediates the dissociation of Hsp90 from client proteins and promotes their rapid degradation by the proteasome. Several reports have demonstrated an interaction between HIF-1α and Hsp90 (51Gradin K. McGuire J. Wenger R.H. Kvietikova I. fhitelaw M.L. Toftgard R. Tora L. Gassmann M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), although a definitive biological role for this interaction has remained elusive. We therefore investigated whether Hsp90 might regulate HIF-1α protein stability in the absence of VHL. To address this question, we used the RCC lines C2 and C6 (3Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4093) Google Scholar, 54Gorospe M. Egan J.M. Zbar B. Lerman M. Geil L. Kuzmin I. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that lack a functional VHL protein and therefore express an inherently stable HIF-1α protein under normoxia. As shown in Fig.1A (upper panel), HIF-1α protein was highly expressed under normoxia in untreated cells but was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in response to GA treatment. It appeared that HIF-1α from C2 cells was less sensitive to the effects of GA when compared with the protein from C6 cells, prompting us to extend the duration of drug treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A (middle panel), this prolonged treatment enhanced the sensitivity of HIF-1α to GA, so that the effective GA concentration for both cell lines occurred within the 0.1–0.5 μm range. The lowest panel of Fig.1A shows that GA promoted the down-regulation of HIF-1α in a time-dependent manner, with the protein in both cell lines diminishing over 6–8 h. To verify the ability of GA to down-regulate HIF-1α levels, 786-O cells deficient for both HIF-1α and VHL (3Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4093) Google Scholar) were transfected with wild-type HIF-1α and protein levels were assessed. As shown in Fig. 1B, GA treatment resulted in a rapid decrease in HIF-1α protein levels, with over 50% of the protein being eliminated within 1 h of treatment. Under hypoxic conditions, the normally labile HIF-1α protein is stabilized in VHL-competent cells. It was therefore of interest to determine whether hypoxia could antagonize the effect of GA in cells expressing or lacking functional VHL. Caki-1 is an RCC line that contains wild-type VHL, and in these cells HIF-1α is induced by hypoxia (3Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4093) Google Scholar). Caki-1 cells were treated with GA while under hypoxia, subsequent to hypoxia-induced stabilization of HIF-1α. Similarly, VHL-deficient C6 cells were treated with GA under normoxia or hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment of cells with GA or its similarly acting, clinically administered analog 17-AAG (55Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 56Hostein I. Robertson D. DiStefano F. Workman P. Clarke P.A.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar), significantly decreased HIF-1α protein levels, regardless of oxygen tension. To exclude the possibility that the effects of GA on HIF-1α were nonspecific, we examined the association of HIF-1α with Hsp90 in the presence or absence of drug. In accordance with other reports (40Xu W. Mimnaugh E. Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar,58An W.G. Schulte T.W. Neckers L.M. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 355-360PubMed Google Scholar), the GA-mediated down-regulation of HIF-1α would be expected to be preceded by dissociation of the HIF-1α·Hsp90 chaperone complex. As shown in Fig. 1D, treatment of either C2 or Caki-1 cells with GA led to a marked decrease in the amount of HIF-1α associated with Hsp90, and GA was equally capable of displacing Hsp90 from HIF-1α independent of oxygen tension. Importantly, oxygen level had no effect on the ability of HIF-1α to associate with Hsp90. To determine whether GA promoted HIF-1α down-regulation at the RNA or protein level, we pretreated RCC lines C2 and C6 with GA, and protein synthesis was subsequently inhibited with CHX. The level of HIF-1α protein in cells exposed to the combination treatment was compared with that seen in cells exposed to CHX alone. As shown in Fig.2A, the stability of existing HIF-1α protein in both cell lines was markedly compromised by GA. To more clearly determine the effects of GA on the half-life of HIF-1α protein, and to examine the sensitivity of newly synthesized protein to Hsp90 disruption, we metabolically labeled C2 cells with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1 h in the presence or absence of GA and chased for the indicated times (Fig. 2B). The data obtained confirm the sensitivity of newly synthesized HIF-1α protein to GA and demonstrate a greater than 4-fold reduction in HIF-1α half-life in the presence of drug. To examine whether the GA-mediated degradation of HIF-1α proceeds via the proteasome, we treated RCC lines for 8 h with the general proteasome inhibitor ALLnL, with GA, or with both agents and examined HIF-1α levels in nuclear and cytosolic detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions. As shown in Fig.3A, treatment with ALLnL resulted in an increase of total HIF-1α levels in the nuclear soluble fraction, de"

https://openalex.org/W2089068494,"Members of the Wnt family of secreted molecules have been established as key factors in determining cell fate and morphogenic signaling. It has long been recognized that Wnt induces morphogenic signaling through the Tcf/LEF-1 cascade by regulating free intracellular levels of β-catenin, a co-factor for Tcf/LEF-1 transcription factors. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Wnt-3A can also directly induce transcription from theLEF-1 promoter. This induction was dependent on glycogen synthase kinase 3β inactivation, a rise in free intracellular β-catenin, and a short 110-bp Wnt-responsive element (WRE) in the LEF-1 promoter. Linear and internal deletion of this WRE led to a dramatic increase in constitutiveLEF-1 promoter activity and loss of Wnt-3A responsiveness. In isolation, the 110-bp WRE conferred context-independent Wnt-3A or β-catenin(S37A) responsiveness to a heterologous SV40 promoter. Studies expressing dominant active and negative forms of LEF-1, β-catenin, GSK-3β, and β-catenin/LEF-1 fusions suggest that Wnt-3A activates the LEF-1 promoter through a β-catenin-dependent and LEF-1-independent process. Wnt-3A expression also induced multiple changes in the binding of factors to the WRE and suggests that regulatory mechanisms may involve modulation of a multiprotein complex.

Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). One major pathway induced by Wnt signaling includes the β-catenin-Tcf-LEF-1 transcriptional complexes (2Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this context, Wnt signals control the cytoplasmic availability of β-catenin for its transcriptional binding partners (Tcf/LEF-1) through an Axin-adenomatous polyposis coli complex that controls the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of free intracellular β-catenin. In the absence of a Wnt signals, GSK-3β1 is highly active, leading to the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-catenin through the adenomatous polyposis coli-Axin complex (3Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 4Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wnt activation antagonizes the effect of GSK-3β and increases the free intracellular pool of β-catenin by inhibiting its phosphorylation-dependent degradation. Stabilization of β-catenin increases its abundance in bipartite trans-activation complexes with LEF-1/Tcf1 proteins (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar).The importance of LEF-1 function in Wnt signaling has been long established in numerous models of development and morphogenesis. In such developmental signal transduction cascades, Wnt can stimulate the transcriptional activation of numerous developmental genes through the activation of β-catenin/LEF-1 complexes in the nucleus. However, in many developmental model systems, LEF-1 expression is also induced in a similar fashion as Wnt genes (5Poss K.D. Shen J. Keating M.T. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and in some instances is also sufficient to induce a Wnt-like developmental process (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Interestingly, null mutations in LEF-1/Tcf-1 generated a phenotype in mice that is virtually identical to that seen inWnt-3A-deficient mice (8Galceran J. Farinas I. Depew M.J. Clevers H. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the regulation of β-catenin/LEF-1 pathways by Wnt may be more complex than simply regulation of intracellular β-catenin through the GSK-3β pathway and suggest that Wnt might also regulateLEF-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level.Several potential possibilities might explain Wnt inducibility ofLEF-1 gene expression during developmental processes. First, Wnt may induce LEF-1-mediated gene expression through resident LEF-1/Tcf1 sites in the LEF-1 promoter. Recently, the partial cloning of the LEF-1 promoter indeed revealed evidence for LEF-1 binding sites (9Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Waterman M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this same group recently reported that alternative full-length and truncated (β-catenin binding domain deleted) isoforms of LEF-1 might be controlled by β-catenin-Tcf-1 complexes in the LEF-1promoter (10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second potential model for Wnt-regulatedLEF-1 gene expression includes the induction of yet unidentified non-LEF-1/Tcf1 transcription factors that are induced by Wnt and bind to promoter sequences. In the present study, we characterized regions of the LEF-1 promoter that are responsible for induction by Wnt-3A in an epithelial cell line. Interestingly, this Wnt-induced transcriptional regulation of theLEF-1 promoter was independent of known LEF-1/Tcf1 binding sites and appeared to be regulated by combined derepression and enhancer function at a 110-bp Wnt-responsive element. Wnt-3A induction was dependent on the inactivation of the GSK-3β pathway and a concurrent elevation in free intracellular β-catenin, suggesting similarities to other LEF-1/Tcf1 activation cascades.DISCUSSIONThe importance of LEF-1 function in Wnt signaling has been long established in numerous models of development and morphogenesis. In such developmental signal transduction cascades, Wnt can stimulate the transcriptional activation of numerous developmental genes through the activation of β-catenin-LEF-1 complexes in the nucleus (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). In many of these developmental processes, LEF-1transcription is often also uniquely regulated in concert with Wnt-inductive mechanisms. Our studies demonstrating Wnt-3A and Wnt-3 induction of the LEF-1 promoter have begun to provide a mechanistic foundation for this observation of coordinate regulation of certain Wnts and the LEF-1 gene. Several findings suggest that Wnt-3A induction of the LEF-1 promoter occurs through a β-catenin-dependent pathway. First, Wnt-3A induces stabilization of β-catenin, and the β-catenin(S37A) mutant similarly induced the LEF-1 promoter as seen with Wnt-3A expression alone. Second, combined expression of Wnt-3A and β-catenin(S37A) induced similar levels of transcription as seen in the presence of either factor alone. Third, when Wnt-3A stabilization of β-catenin was blocked by overexpression of wild type GSK-3β or the dominant active GSK-3β(S9A) mutant, Wnt-3A induction of theLEF-1 promoter was substantially reduced. In summary, these findings support the notion that Wnt-3A induction of theLEF-1 promoter is dependent on β-catenin. The dependence of Wnt-3A-inductive development pathways on β-catenin-LEF-1 complex formation has been previously reported (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting that Wnt-7A, which did not induce the LEF-1 promoter, has been previously shown to act in a β-catenin-independent manner during chick limb bud development (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).Given the fact that numerous Tcf1/LEF-1 binding consensus sequences reside within the LEF-1 promoter, we investigated whether LEF-1 might be responsible for autoregulation of its own promoter through β-catenin association. Five Tcf1/LEF-1 binding sites are located in the LEF-1 promoter, and all lie upstream of −884 bp. Several of these sites have been demonstrated to bind recombinant LEF-1 (10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our studies the deletion of all Tcf1/LEF-1 binding sites did not have any effect on the Wnt-3A responsiveness of the LEF-1 promoter (LF-884/-273). These results suggest that previous reported interactions of theLEF-1 promoter with Tcf1/LEF-1/β-catenin complexes (9Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Waterman M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not likely play a role in Wnt-3A responsiveness of theLEF-1 promoter. The lack of LEF-1 involvement in Wnt-3A induction of the LEF-1 promoter was also supported by studies expression a dominant active fusion of LEF-1/β-catenin that had no effect on LEF-1 promoter activity. Internal deletion of −884 to −768 bp of the promoter confirmed the existence of a Wnt-3A-responsive element (WRE) that appeared to act by a mechanism of derepression following Wnt-3A stimulation. However, studies placing the WRE in isolation 5′ or 3′ to a minimal SV40 promoter suggested that, although this element contains all the necessary information responsible for Wnt-3A induction, it does not possess repressor function out of the context of the LEF-1 promoter. Furthermore, this element gave rise to inducible expression of the SV40 promoter in the presence of β-catenin(S37A) expression, substantiating that β-catenin is likely mediating Wnt-responsiveness at the WRE. Whether this effect is a direct consequence of β-catenin interaction with factors binding at the WRE or an indirect effect by which β-catenin alters the abundance of WRE binding factors remains to be determined. Nonetheless, the ability of the WRE to convey Wnt-3A/β-catenin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, in a context-independent fashion, fulfills the requirement for defining the WRE as an enhancer. Repressor functions of this element within the context of the LEF-1 promoter likely are due to context-dependent interactions with other binding factors.The identity of Wnt-3A-inducible factors that are capable of acting at the WRE within the LEF-1 promoter remains unclear. The finding that internal deletion of the WRE significantly enhances transcription suggests that resident binding proteins in the absence of Wnt signals likely repress transcription. If this sequence was solely acting as a repressor in the context of the endogenous promoter, one might expect to find changes in transcription factor binding that are removed by Wnt expression. However, studies utilizing oligonucleotide-scanning EMSA suggest that Wnt-3A-induced changes in factor binding at the WRE may be more complex than simple removal of factors. Examples of both increased and decreased binding at specific sites in the WRE could be observed following Wnt-3A expression in 293 cells. Given that this sequence also acts as an enhancer when linked to a heterologous promoter, the recruitment of Wnt-responsive binding factors at the WRE is not unexpected. Currently we conclude that multiple changes in transcription factor complexes are occurring at a minimum of two sites within the WRE. One known transcription factor binding consensus for GCF-1 (GC Factor) (20Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) localized to a region of the WRE demonstrating Wnt-3A-induced binding. Interestingly, GCF-1 was originally identified as a factor that represses transcription from both the epidermal growth factor receptor and β-actin promoters (20Kageyama R. Pastan I. Cell. 1989; 59: 815-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).In summary, the present study has demonstrated compelling evidence that elevated levels of β-catenin are required for the activation of the LEF-1 promoter in response to Wnt signaling. Yet β-catenin-dependent Wnt-3A-mediated activation of the LEF-1 promoter behaves in striking contrast to other promoters induced by Wnt-3A such as Mitf(21Takeda K. Yasumoto K. Takada R. Takada S. Watanabe K. Udono T. Saito H. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mitf-mediated Wnt-3A induction is dependent on β-catenin-LEF-1 complex binding to the promoter. Because the dominant active form of LEF-1 had no effect on LEF-1 promoter activity and Wnt-3A responsiveness persists despite deletion of all Tcf1/LEF-1 bindings sites, the mechanism of β-catenin action most likely does not involve direct binding of β-catenin-LEF-1 or β-catenin-Tcf1 complexes to the LEF-1 promoter. Several possibilities might explain such a mechanism. First, β-catenin may associate with one or more different binding partners on theLEF-1 promoter in response to Wnt-3A. Such association would be predicted to relieve binding and/or mask the effects of inhibitory proteins at the WRE that reduce its expression in the absence of Wnt-3A signals. A second possibility is that β-catenin mediates the activation of other Wnt-3A-responsive transcription factors, which in turn act on the LEF-1 promoter to relieve inhibition and activate expression. These hypotheses provide a framework for better understanding the complexities of Wnt/β-catenin induction of LEF-1-dependent pathways in development. The Wnt gene family encodes a group of secreted factors that control numerous processes in development, including differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). One major pathway induced by Wnt signaling includes the β-catenin-Tcf-LEF-1 transcriptional complexes (2Seidensticker M.J. Behrens J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this context, Wnt signals control the cytoplasmic availability of β-catenin for its transcriptional binding partners (Tcf/LEF-1) through an Axin-adenomatous polyposis coli complex that controls the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of free intracellular β-catenin. In the absence of a Wnt signals, GSK-3β1 is highly active, leading to the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-catenin through the adenomatous polyposis coli-Axin complex (3Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar, 4Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). In contrast, Wnt activation antagonizes the effect of GSK-3β and increases the free intracellular pool of β-catenin by inhibiting its phosphorylation-dependent degradation. Stabilization of β-catenin increases its abundance in bipartite trans-activation complexes with LEF-1/Tcf1 proteins (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The importance of LEF-1 function in Wnt signaling has been long established in numerous models of development and morphogenesis. In such developmental signal transduction cascades, Wnt can stimulate the transcriptional activation of numerous developmental genes through the activation of β-catenin/LEF-1 complexes in the nucleus. However, in many developmental model systems, LEF-1 expression is also induced in a similar fashion as Wnt genes (5Poss K.D. Shen J. Keating M.T. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Takada S. Stark K.L. Shea M.J. Vassileva G. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 174-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and in some instances is also sufficient to induce a Wnt-like developmental process (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Interestingly, null mutations in LEF-1/Tcf-1 generated a phenotype in mice that is virtually identical to that seen inWnt-3A-deficient mice (8Galceran J. Farinas I. Depew M.J. Clevers H. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Together, these results suggest that the regulation of β-catenin/LEF-1 pathways by Wnt may be more complex than simply regulation of intracellular β-catenin through the GSK-3β pathway and suggest that Wnt might also regulateLEF-1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Several potential possibilities might explain Wnt inducibility ofLEF-1 gene expression during developmental processes. First, Wnt may induce LEF-1-mediated gene expression through resident LEF-1/Tcf1 sites in the LEF-1 promoter. Recently, the partial cloning of the LEF-1 promoter indeed revealed evidence for LEF-1 binding sites (9Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Waterman M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this same group recently reported that alternative full-length and truncated (β-catenin binding domain deleted) isoforms of LEF-1 might be controlled by β-catenin-Tcf-1 complexes in the LEF-1promoter (10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second potential model for Wnt-regulatedLEF-1 gene expression includes the induction of yet unidentified non-LEF-1/Tcf1 transcription factors that are induced by Wnt and bind to promoter sequences. In the present study, we characterized regions of the LEF-1 promoter that are responsible for induction by Wnt-3A in an epithelial cell line. Interestingly, this Wnt-induced transcriptional regulation of theLEF-1 promoter was independent of known LEF-1/Tcf1 binding sites and appeared to be regulated by combined derepression and enhancer function at a 110-bp Wnt-responsive element. Wnt-3A induction was dependent on the inactivation of the GSK-3β pathway and a concurrent elevation in free intracellular β-catenin, suggesting similarities to other LEF-1/Tcf1 activation cascades. DISCUSSIONThe importance of LEF-1 function in Wnt signaling has been long established in numerous models of development and morphogenesis. In such developmental signal transduction cascades, Wnt can stimulate the transcriptional activation of numerous developmental genes through the activation of β-catenin-LEF-1 complexes in the nucleus (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). In many of these developmental processes, LEF-1transcription is often also uniquely regulated in concert with Wnt-inductive mechanisms. Our studies demonstrating Wnt-3A and Wnt-3 induction of the LEF-1 promoter have begun to provide a mechanistic foundation for this observation of coordinate regulation of certain Wnts and the LEF-1 gene. Several findings suggest that Wnt-3A induction of the LEF-1 promoter occurs through a β-catenin-dependent pathway. First, Wnt-3A induces stabilization of β-catenin, and the β-catenin(S37A) mutant similarly induced the LEF-1 promoter as seen with Wnt-3A expression alone. Second, combined expression of Wnt-3A and β-catenin(S37A) induced similar levels of transcription as seen in the presence of either factor alone. Third, when Wnt-3A stabilization of β-catenin was blocked by overexpression of wild type GSK-3β or the dominant active GSK-3β(S9A) mutant, Wnt-3A induction of theLEF-1 promoter was substantially reduced. In summary, these findings support the notion that Wnt-3A induction of theLEF-1 promoter is dependent on β-catenin. The dependence of Wnt-3A-inductive development pathways on β-catenin-LEF-1 complex formation has been previously reported (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, it is interesting that Wnt-7A, which did not induce the LEF-1 promoter, has been previously shown to act in a β-catenin-independent manner during chick limb bud development (7Kengaku M. Capdevila J. Rodriguez-Esteban C., De La Pena J. Johnson R.L. Belmonte J.C.I. Tabin C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1274-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).Given the fact that numerous Tcf1/LEF-1 binding consensus sequences reside within the LEF-1 promoter, we investigated whether LEF-1 might be responsible for autoregulation of its own promoter through β-catenin association. Five Tcf1/LEF-1 binding sites are located in the LEF-1 promoter, and all lie upstream of −884 bp. Several of these sites have been demonstrated to bind recombinant LEF-1 (10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our studies the deletion of all Tcf1/LEF-1 binding sites did not have any effect on the Wnt-3A responsiveness of the LEF-1 promoter (LF-884/-273). These results suggest that previous reported interactions of theLEF-1 promoter with Tcf1/LEF-1/β-catenin complexes (9Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Waterman M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1994-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 10Hovanes K., Li, T.W. Munguia J.E. Truong T. Milovanovic T. Lawrence Marsh J. Holcombe R.F. Waterman M.L. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not likely play a role in Wnt-3A responsiveness of theLEF-1 promoter. The lack of LEF-1 involvement in Wnt-3A induction of the LEF-1 promoter was also supported by studies expression a dominant active fusion of LEF-1/β-catenin that had no effect on LEF-1 promoter activity. Internal deletion of −884 to −768 bp of the promoter confirmed the existence of a Wnt-3A-responsive element (WRE) that appeared to act by a mechanism of derepression following Wnt-3A stimulation. However, studies placing the WRE in isolation 5′ or 3′ to a minimal SV40 promoter suggested that, although this element contains all the necessary information responsible for Wnt-3A induction, it does not possess repressor function out of the context of the LEF-1 promoter. Furthermore, this element gave rise to inducible expression of the SV40 promoter in the presence of β-catenin(S37A) expression, substantiating that β-catenin is likely mediating Wnt-responsiveness at the WRE. Whether this effect is a direct consequence of β-catenin interaction with factors binding at the WRE or an indirect effect by which β-catenin alters the abundance of WRE binding factors remains to be determined. Nonetheless, the ability of the WRE to convey Wnt-3A/β-catenin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, in a context-independent fashion, fulfills the requirement for defining the WRE as an enhancer. Repressor functions of this element within the context of the LEF-1 promoter likely are due to context-dependent interactions with other binding factors.The identity of Wnt-3A-inducible factors that are capable of acting at the WRE within the LEF-1 promoter remains unclear. The finding that internal deletion of the WRE significantly enhances transcription suggests that resident binding proteins in the absence of Wnt signals likely repress transcription. If this sequence was solely acting as a repressor in the context of the endogenous promoter, one might expect to find changes in transcription factor binding that are removed by Wnt expression. However, studies utilizing oligonucleotide-scanning EMSA suggest that Wnt-3A-induced changes in factor binding at the WRE may be more complex than simple removal of factors. Examples of both increased and decreased binding at specific sites in the WRE could be observed following Wnt-3A expression in 293 cells. Given that this sequence also acts as an enhancer when linked to a heterologous promoter, the recruitment of Wnt-responsive binding factors at the WRE is not unexpected. Currently we conclude that multiple changes in transcription factor complexes are occurring at a minimum of two sites within the WRE.

To understand how these diverse functions are coordinated, we have localized the lectin, ERp57 binding, and polypeptide binding sites of calnexin and calreticulin. Recent structural studies suggest that both proteins consist of a globular domain and an extended arm domain comprised of two sequence motifs repeated in tandem. Our results indicate that the primary lectin site of calnexin and calreticulin resides within the globular domain, but the results also point to a much weaker secondary site within the arm domain which lacks specificity for monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. For both proteins, a site of interaction with ERp57 is centered on the arm domain, which retains ∼50% of binding compared with full-length controls. This site is in addition to a Zn2+-dependent site located within the globular domain of both proteins. Finally, calnexin and calreticulin suppress the aggregation of unfolded proteins via a polypeptide binding site located within their globular domains but require the arm domain for full chaperone function.

CNX, a type I transmembrane protein, and its soluble paralog CRT are Ca2+-binding proteins that share sequence similarity that is most pronounced in a central segment containing two proline-rich sequence motifs repeated in tandem (23David V.

Motifs 1 and 2, which are repeated three times each in CRT and four times each in CNX, have consensus sequences of I-DP(D/E)A-KPEDWD(D/E) and G-W-P-IN-P-Y, respectively. In addition, there are three segments of high sequence similarity, A, B, and C, with the last two flanking the repeat motifs (Fig. 1).In cultured cell systems, the association of CNX and CRT with newly synthesized glycoproteins is transient, with dissociation occurring at or near acquisition of a native structure. CNX and CRT also associate in prolonged fashion to misfolded or incompletely assembled glycoproteins (for review, see Refs. 1Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 2Leach M.R. Williams D.B. Michalak M. Eggleton P. Calreticulin in Health and Disease. 2nd Ed.

Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These interactions have been shown to promote proper glycoprotein folding and subunit assembly, either to enhance or inhibit the degradation of non-native glycoprotein conformers, and to retain misfolded or incompletely folded glycoproteins in the ER (1Bergeron J.J. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 2Leach M.R. Williams D.B. Michalak M. Eggleton P.

How these diverse functions are accomplished is controversial. In one model, the interactions of glycoproteins with CNX and CRT are controlled entirely by the presence of the single terminal glucose residue on the Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide (5Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar,27Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Cycles of release and rebinding are regulated by glucose removal and readdition catalyzed by the action of the ER enzymes glucosidase II and UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, respectively. In this model, CNX and CRT do not function as classical molecular chaperones but are proposed to retain unfolded glycoproteins and coordinate the activities of other ER chaperones and folding enzymes. Such a view is supported by the finding that CNX and CRT interact with the ER resident thiol oxidoreductase, ERp57 (28Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a second “dual binding” model has been proposed in which unfolded glycoproteins interact with both the lectin site and a polypeptide binding site in CNX and CRT (8Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 29Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In this model, the polypeptide component of the interaction serves a molecular chaperone function to suppress aggregation of the unfolded substrate. Support for this model comes from in vitro studies demonstrating that CNX and CRT can discriminate between folded and unfolded conformers of nonglycosylated proteins and that they can suppress the aggregation of unfolded proteins as potently as members of the HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and small heat shock families of chaperones (29Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39779-39787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The multiple binding functions attributed to CNX and CRT prompted us to investigate how these binding sites are organized. Previous studies have suggested that their lectin sites might be centered on the repeat motifs, although oligosaccharide binding by this segment represents only a small fraction of that observed with the full-length proteins (7Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 32Peterson J.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CRT has been shown to interact with ERp57 in a Zn2+-dependent manner via a segment located near its N terminus (33Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and, in the absence of Zn2+, via a segment within its repeat motifs (34Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Comparable studies on ERp57 binding by CNX have not been undertaken. Finally, there have been no reports on the location of a polypeptide binding site for either protein. Recently, the crystal structure of CNX (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) has shown the protein to consist of a globular β-sandwich domain as well as an elongated hairpin “arm” domain formed by the repeat motifs (Fig. 1) An NMR structure of the CRT repeat motifs (36Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) has shown that this segment also forms a hairpin arm domain (Fig. 1). With this structural information as a guide, we employed extensive deletion mutagenesis to localize the lectin sites of CNX and CRT, their ERp57 binding sites, and the sites whereby they suppress the aggregation of nonglycosylated proteins. The results necessitate a re-evaluation of previous localization studies and offer a more coherent view of the functional organization of these complex proteins.DISCUSSIONA recently reported x-ray crystal structure shows that the ER luminal portion of canine CNX consists of two domains, a β-sandwich globular domain that contains boxes A, B, and C and a 140 Å hairpin extension (arm domain) formed by the repeat motifs (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A structurally similar arm domain is seen in the NMR structure (36Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) of the CRT repeat motifs (Fig. 7). In both proteins, the motif 1 repeats form one strand of the hairpin, and the motif 2 repeats form the other strand. Each motif 1 repeat interacts with a corresponding motif 2 repeat in a head-to-tail fashion. Upon soaking the CNX crystal in glucose, the monosaccharide was detected within a concave depression in the globular domain (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Six glucose contact residues were identified, four in box A, one between boxes A and B, and one in box C, all highly conserved among CNXs and CRTs (Fig. 7). The presence of a lectin site within the concave surface of the globular domain is consistent with its structural similarity to the galectin and legume lectin families. A Ca2+ binding site was also identified within the globular domain (Fig. 7A), which is different from a site mapped previously to the repeat motifs using45Ca2+ overlay and ruthenium red binding (42Tjoelker L.W. Seyfried C.E. Eddy R.L., Jr. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Calderon J. Schreiber R.B. Gray P.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3229-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Also, there are two disulfide bonds in the CNX structure, one in the globular domain, shown to be labile, and the second near the tip of the arm domain (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Given this structural information, it remained to be established how CNX and CRT utilize their two domains to function as molecular chaperones for glycoproteins. Consequently, we set out to map the lectin, ERp57 binding, and polypeptide binding sites of CNX and CRT.FIG. 7Functional sites on CNX and CRT.A, locations of the lectin, ERp57 binding, and polypeptide binding sites on CNX and CRT as determined in this study. Shown are the x-ray crystal structure of the ER luminal domain of CNX (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) and one of the NMR structures determined for the arm domain of CRT (36Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Guntert P. Braun D. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A presumed CNX-like globular domain has been added to the CRT structure to facilitate depiction of functional sites. CNX residues identified as contacting glucose in the crystal structure are depicted instick representation. B, model of the interaction of monoglucosylated folding intermediates with CNX or CRT. The monoglucosylated substrate binds to the chaperone through both lectin-oligosaccharide interactions as well as polypeptide-based associations (29Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This enables CNX and CRT to function more effectively with glycoprotein substrates than traditional polypeptide-based chaperones (31Stronge V.S. Saito Y. Ihara Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39779-39787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The terminal glucose residue of the substrate engages the lectin sites of CNX and CRT within their globular domains. Polypeptide-based contacts occur primarily between the substrate and the globular domain, but additional contacts may occur through the arm domain as well. The flexible arm domain also binds ERp57 and brings it into proximity with the substrate, where it catalyzes disulfide bond formation and isomerization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When CNX deletion mutants were assayed for their binding to the natural oligosaccharide ligand [3H]Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, we found that 75% of the CNX oligosaccharide binding capability could be localized to its globular domain (CNX 1–255/390–461). This is consistent with the location of bound glucose in the x-ray crystal structure of CNX (35Schrag J.D. Bergeron J.J., Li, Y. Borisova S. Hahn M. Thomas D.Y. Cygler M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 633-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although a corresponding globular lectin domain has not yet been demonstrated for CRT, we showed for the first time that a CRT deletion construct lacking the repeat motifs and corresponding to the globular domain of CNX (CRT 1–189/284–401) also retained 75% of the oligosaccharide binding observed with full-length CRT. This finding, coupled with the sequence similarity between CNX and CRT, suggests that CRT possesses a globular lectin domain akin to that of CNX (Fig. 7A). In agreement with previous results (7Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,32Peterson J.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we detected a weak lectin site within the repeat motifs (arm domains) of both CNX and CRT. Deletion constructs that correspond to the repeat motifs alone (CNX 257–387 and CRT 191–282) were able to bind oligosaccharide, albeit much more weakly than the full-length controls. However, through the use of competitor oligosaccharides that either possess or lack a terminal α1–3-linked glucose we could demonstrate that oligosaccharide binding by the repeats differed from that observed by the globular domain in that it lacked specificity for monoglucosylated oligosaccharides. Collectively, these findings establish that the globular domain contains the lectin site for the physiologically relevant oligosaccharide and help to clarify previous studies that reported oligosaccharide binding by the repeat motifs.Using a similar approach, we localized the Zn2+-independent ERp57 binding site to the arm domains of both CNX and CRT. We found that although the globular domains exhibited minimal binding, the arm domains retained about 50% of the ERp57 binding exhibited by the full-length controls. Additional deletion mutants revealed that the first repeat 1 motif and the last motif 2 repeat, which exhibit paired interactions at the base of the arm domains of both CNX and CRT, are not required for ERp57 binding (Fig. 7A). This suggests that ERp57 binds to segments of the arm domain which are located distal to the globular domain. During the preparation of this manuscript, Ellgaard and co-workers (34Frickel E.M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Helenius A. Wuthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) described the use of NMR chemical shift mapping to localize ERp57 interaction with CRT residues 225–251. This segment corresponds to the last copy of motif 1 and the first copy of motif 2, representing the tip of the arm domain. In conjunction with the present findings, it is likely that ERp57 binds primarily to the tips of the arm domains of both CRT and CNX. However, because the arm domains retain only 50% of the binding observed with full-length controls, there appears to be a role for the globular domains as well, presumably in constraining the orientation or conformation of the arm domains. Taken together, the oligosaccharide and ERp57 mapping studies show that the globular domain is the main site of interaction with monoglucosylated Asn-linked oligosaccharide, whereas the arm domain acts to tether the ERp57 oxidoreductase.In addition to the Zn2+-independent ERp57 binding site described above, we observed that in the presence of 100 μm Zn2+ ERp57 bound to the N-terminal portion of the CRT globular domain (CRT 1–182). This corresponds to a site of interaction previously described by Corbett et al. (33Corbett E.F. Oikawa K. Francois P. Tessier D.C. Kay C. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. Krause K.H. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6203-6211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In their study, Zn2+-independent ERp57 was not observed, which may reflect differences in the binding assays employed. Using 1 mm Zn2+, they measured changes in fluorescence of Cascade Blue-labeled ERp57 in response to CRT addition, which requires significant changes in the environment of the fluorophore. We also show that CNX has a Zn2+-dependent site of interaction with ERp57 localized to the N-terminal portion of its globular domain (CNX 1–256). It should be noted that the addition of 10–100 μm Zn2+ causes a conformational change in CRT resulting in increased hydrophobicity (43Khanna N.C. Tokuda M. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8883-8887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased chaperone activity (30Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and, above 2 mm, quantitative precipitation (44Baksh S. Spamer C. Heilmann C. Michalak M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the presence of 100 μmZn2+, CNX aggregates rapidly at elevated temperatures and exhibits reduced solubility at room temperature, suggesting that like CRT, it exposes hydrophobic stretches upon Zn2+binding. 2M. Leach and D. Williams, unpublished observations. Given these solubility changes, we considered the possibility that Zn2+-dependent ERp57 binding to CRT and CNX is nonspecific. However, Zn2+-dependent ERp57 binding was preserved despite the inclusion in our assays of 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 to minimize nonspecific absorption. The physiological significance of this second mode of ERp57 interaction is unclear. It is known that Zn2+ is present within the ER (45Reddy A.G. Devi B.G. Rao S.B. Gupta P.D. Cytobios. 1989; 60: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar), but whether its concentration is sufficient to induce conformational changes in CRT and CNX and to influence ERp57 binding remains an open question.Efforts to localize a polypeptide binding site within CRT and CNX identified their globular lectin domains as the region primarily responsible for suppressing the aggregation of nonglycosylated proteins. This was supported by the finding that N- and C-terminal deletion mutants lacking either of the conserved boxes B or C exhibited impaired aggregation suppression and by the fact that the globular domain constructs (CRT 1–189/284–401 and CNX 1–255/390–461) retained the ability to suppress aggregation, whereas the arm domains (CRT 191–282 and CNX 257–387) did not. However, although the arm domains themselves were incapable of suppressing aggregation, they clearly enhanced aggregation suppression by the globular domains. This suggests that polypeptide segments of non-native folding intermediates may interact with both domains of CRT and CNX (Fig. 7A). Because molecular chaperones interact with folding intermediates through binding sites that possess some hydrophobic character (46Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar), we examined the surface of CNX for hydrophobic patches. Candidate hydrophobic interaction sites do exist on the same face of the globular domain as the lectin site, and additional sites are present along the length of the arm domain. Further site-directed mutagenesis within these regions will be required to determine more precisely how CRT and CNX bind to nonglycosylated folding intermediates.Taken together, our findings suggest a model whereby CRT and CNX interact with non-native conformers of glycoproteins during folding within the ER. As shown in Fig. 7B, we envision that a monoglucosylated glycoprotein substrate could occupy the large cavity formed by the globular domain and the arm domain. This would permit contacts through the lectin site as well as through polypeptide binding sites residing within both domains. The arm domain, which is presumably quite flexible, would perform the additional function of bringing ERp57 in proximity to free thiol groups to form mixed disulfide intermediates in both oxidation and isomerization reactions. The arm may also physically constrain the glycoprotein, impeding rapid diffusion away from the chaperone. In this context, the previously described enhancement of aggregation suppression by CRT and CNX in the presence of ATP (29Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 30Saito Y. Ihara Y. Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6718-6729Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) might be caused by the closing of the arm domain over substrate in a manner analogous to the α-helical “lid” segment of HSP70 (47Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Given progress in delineating the lectin, ERp57 binding, and polypeptide binding sites of CRT and CNX, we are in a position to test how these functions are integrated into a functional chaperone and in turn regulated by cofactors such as Ca2+, Zn2+, and ATP. Selective ablation of each of these functions by mutagenesis and assessing the consequences using in vitro and in vivo assays of glycoprotein folding and quality control should be most informative. As the site of synthesis of proteins destined for secretion, cell surface expression, and residency in the secretory pathway, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1contains an array of folding enzymes and molecular chaperones that facilitate the folding of newly synthesized proteins.

Although initially believed to operate as components of distinct signaling pathways, several studies have demonstrated that the NF-κB and Akt signaling pathways can converge. Indeed, IκB kinase, the kinase involved in NF-κB activation, is a substrate of Akt, and activation of Akt therefore stimulates NF-κB activity.

Moreover, NF-κB is involved in the regulation of cell survival (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 2Huxford T. Malek S.

Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Although found to cause cell death in some cases, in a majority of systems NF-κB activation provides a survival-promoting signal (4Bours V. Bentires-Alj M. Hellin A.C. Viatour P. Robe P. Delhalle S. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Classical NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of the p50 and p65/RelA subunits, which exists in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex bound by IκB proteins (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 2Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Generally, the activation of NF-κB involves the phosphorylation of IκB, which then targets IκB for ubiquitination and degradation. This permits NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it activates gene transcription. A wide variety of NF-κB-responsive genes have been identified. A key regulatory step in this pathway of NF-κB activation is the activation of a high molecular weight IκB kinase (IKK)1 complex in which catalysis is thought to be performed by kinases including IKKα and IKKβ. Exactly how these IKKs are activated is the subject of much investigation. One well studied pathway that leads to NF-κB activation and which is activated by the cytokine TNFα involves the intracellular signaling molecules TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF2 and TRAF6) and leads to the activation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), which phosphorylates the IKKs (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 2Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

More recent studies have shown that IKKα and IKKβ can be phosphorylated by an alternative pathway, which involves Akt. Indeed TNFα- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced NF-κB activation has been reported to require Akt (5Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B.

In addition to TNFα and PDGF, the activation of NF-κB by interleukin-1, bradykinin, interferon α/β, and bacterial proteins also has been reported to involve Akt activation (11Xie P. Browning D.D.

Akt/PKB is a serine-threonine kinase that is best known for its ability to inhibit cell death pathways (reviewed in Refs. 15Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 16Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

It does so by directly phosphorylating and inactivating proteins involved in apoptosis including GSK3, Bad, Forkhead, and procaspase-9. Activation of Akt by growth factor and cytokine treatment generally occurs via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3 kinase) pathway. Upon stimulation, PI-3 kinase phosphorylates specific phosphoinositide lipids, which accumulate in the plasma membrane, creating docking sites for Akt. At the plasma membrane Akt undergoes phosphorylation at two residues, Thr308 and Ser473, leading to its activation. Although the evidence for the involvement of Akt in NF-κB activation is compelling, whether NF-κB can affect Akt activity has not been examined. We report here that the expression and activity of Akt is regulated by NF-κB. Recombinant human IGF-1 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), recombinant human TNFα was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and (lipopolysaccharide) LPS was purchased from Sigma. Actinomycin D, cycloheximide, SN-50, wortmannin, and LY294002 were purchased fromCalbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and TPCK was purchased from Sigma. The plasmids encoding p65-FLAG (CMV-p65) and IκB-α (CMV-IκBα) were gift from A. S. Baldwin (University of North Carolina) and R. Gaynor (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), respectively. The CMV-Akt-Myc was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IκB-α and p65 and the mouse monoclonal Myc antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against total Akt, Ser(P)473 Akt, Akt2, Akt3, and phospho-GSK3 were from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal β-tubulin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NIH3T3 cells and HEK293 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), which were all obtained from Invitrogen. Cerebellar granule neurons were cultured from dissociated cerebella of 7–8-day-old rats as described previously (18D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in basal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mmglutamine (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml gentamycin on dishes coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well, 1.2 × 107 cells/60-mm dish, or 3.0 × 107 cells/100-mm dish. Cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium 18–22 h after plating to prevent replication of non-neuronal cells. The cultures were maintained for 6–7 days prior to experimental treatments. When NIH3T3 cells were treated with TNFα or LPS, cultures at about 80% confluency on 60-mm dishes were used. Prior to treatment, the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. When used, SN-50 (10 μm) and TPCK (10 μm) were added to the medium 1 h prior to the addition of TNFα or LPS whereas wortmannin and LY294002 were added 2 h prior to the addition. Pretreatment with actinomycin D and cycloheximide was performed for 1 h. For treatment with IGF-1, cerebellar granule neuron cultures were switched to serum-free Basal Eagle's medium with Earle's salts for 3 h prior to the addition of IGF-1 (25 ng/ml). When used, SN-50 and TPCK were added 2 h prior to stimulation with IGF-1. NIH3T3 cells and HEK293-T cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 per 60-mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were carried out the following day using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 5–6 μg of plasmid DNA was used per dish, and the transfections were carried out for 4–6 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium. The transfection medium was then replaced for 48 h by serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (unless specified otherwise). After treatment, confluent cell monolayers in 60-mm dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by incubation for 20 min in 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1× protease mixture) and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved and mixed with 6× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 4–20% linear gradient Tris-HCl-ready gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk (except for phospho-Akt Western blots in which 5% bovine serum albumin was used) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 and were incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein of interest was visualized with enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL, AmershamBiosciences) reagents. Images of the bands were scanned by reflectance scanning densitometry, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using NIH Image software. Akt assays were performed on Akt that was immunoprecipitated from neuronal cultures or cell lines using a kit from Cell Signaling Technologies. Following treatment, the cultures were placed on ice and harvested using non-denaturing lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors). The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and the protein Akt was immunoprecipitated from 200 μl of cell-free extracts. The immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer. When in vitro kinase assay was carried out the immune complexes were washed twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 10 mmMgCl2). In vitro kinase assays were performed for 30 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of reaction volume containing the 30 μl of immunoprecipitates in kinase buffer, 200 μm ATP. GSK3 fusion protein (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as a substrate for Akt kinase activity. The reactions were terminated with 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting using a phospho-GSK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). To obtain cytoplasmic proteins, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), resuspended in buffer containing 10 mmHEPES pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm β-glycophosphate, 5% glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated on ice for 15 min. At the end of incubation, 0.05 volumes of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. Cells were vortexed for 30 s and then subjected to micro-centrifugation for 30 s. Supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The protein concentrations of the cytoplasmic extracts were determined using Bio-Rad reagent. Nuclei from NIH3T3 cells were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 300 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture and extracted on ice for 30 min followed by micro-centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Concentrations of these nuclear extracts were determined by the Bradford method using reagents from Bio-Rad. 10 μg of each nuclear extract sample was incubated with 0.1 pmol of32P-labeled double-stranded κB binding oligonucleotide (5′-GCTGGGGACTTTC-3′) or SP1 binding oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) in buffer containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2 , and 12% glycerol at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were analyzed by 5% native PAGE followed by autoradiography. For competition and antibody-mediated supershift experiments, antibodies or oligonucleotides were added to the reaction for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. The mRNA levels of Akt in different plasmid-transfected cells were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. 1 μg of total RNA, isolated using an RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen), was used in reverse transcription reactions as described by the manufacturer. The resulting total cDNA was then used in the PCR to measure the mRNA levels of Akt. The mRNA level of β-actin was used as internal control. PCR was carried out with Taq polymerase, and conditions were as follows: pre-denaturing at 94 °C for 3 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. The sequences of the primers used were upstream primer (5′-ATCGTCGCCAAGGATGAGGT-3′) and downstream primer (5′-TCTCGTGGTCCTGGTTGTAG-3′) for Akt and upstream primer (5′-TCACCAACTGGGACGACATG-3′) and downstream primer (5′-AGTCCTGTGGCATCCACGAA-3′) for β-actin. TNFα is a commonly used activator of NF-κB. Treatment with TNFα causes the rapid degradation of IκB proteins, permitting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and resulting in increased DNA binding activity of NF-κB (1Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4085) Google Scholar, 2Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

As shown in Fig.1A, besides stimulating IκB breakdown, treatment of NIH3T3 cells with TNFα increases Akt phosphorylation. Stimulation of Akt by TNFα has been observed by other laboratories (5Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 6Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y.

As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, however, following TNFα treatment the reduction in IκB-α levels is detectable after 5 min, whereas the increase in Akt phosphorylation occurs only after 15 min. As shown in Fig.2, the translocation of p65/RelA to the nucleus and the resulting increase in DNA binding activity of p65 can be observed within 10 min of TNFα-treatment, which is also before the phosphorylation of Akt can be detected.FIG. 2Nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of p65 following TNF α treatment.NIH3T3 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for various time periods as indicated above the panels. Following treatment the cells were lysed, and nuclear extracts were prepared. An aliquot of the extracts was used for Western blotting while the rest was used in EMSA assays. A, results of Western blot analysis using an antibody against p65. B, results of EMSA using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF-κB binding site as probe. Lanes marked κB and SP1 are control lanes that demonstrate specificity of binding in which a 100-fold excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide or a nucleotide containing the SP1 binding site was included in the binding reaction. In the lanes marked p65-Ab and Control-Ab, a preincubation of the extract with p65 antibody or preimmune serum was performed. NF-κB binding activity was disrupted by p65 antibody. Similar supershift assays using antibodies against p50, c-rel, and relB failed to affect binding activity appreciably (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Another agent that is commonly used to activate NF-κB in vivo and in culture is LPS. As shown in Fig. 1C, LPS treatment also stimulates Akt phosphorylation. The increase in Akt phosphorylation occurs at 1 h whereas the decrease in IκB-α levels is detectable after 30 min (Fig. 1, C and D). Taken together, these results show that the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation by TNFα and LPS begins after NF-κB activation has occurred, raising the possibility that NF-κB may be involved in stimulating Akt phosphorylation. To examine whether the stimulation of Akt is in fact a consequence of NF-κB activation, we used SN-50, a cell-permeable peptide that inhibits NF-κB by blocking its translocation to the nucleus (19Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that SN-50 is highly selective against NF-κB and has no effect on the activities of any other signaling molecule (20Maggirwar S.B. Sarmiere P.D. Dewhurst S. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10356-10365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with SN-50 reduced Akt phosphorylation and activation by TNFα (Fig.3A). As shown in Fig.3A, a similar reduction of Akt phosphorylation and activity is seen with TPCK, another commonly used pharmacological inhibitor of NF-κB that acts by inhibiting IκB degradation (21Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 22Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4390-4396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the inhibitory effect of SN-50 and TPCK occurred in other cell types and by stimuli other than TNFα, we used primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. Treatment of cerebellar neurons with IGF-1 causes Akt phosphorylation and activation (24Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 25Kumari S. Liu X. Nguyen T. Zhang X. D'Mello S.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 96: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3B, pretreatment with SN-50 or TPCK substantially reduces Akt phosphorylation induced by IGF-1 treatment, consistent with the involvement of NF-κB in the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation. Although both SN-50 and TPCK are commonly used NF-κB inhibitors, the possibility that these compounds may affect Akt by an NF-κB-independent mechanism cannot be completely excluded. To more directly determine whether NF-κB affects Akt, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with p65/RelA and examined its effect on Akt phosphorylation. Transfection using a p65 expression vector resulted in a dose-dependent increase in total p65 levels (Fig.4A). The increased p65 levels resulted in a robust increase in NF-κB binding activity but not in the binding activity of another transcription factor, SP1 (Fig.4B). As shown in Fig. 4, A and C and consistent with the idea that Akt is a downstream target of NF-κB, overexpression of p65 caused an increase in Akt phosphorylation. Overexpression of IκB-α on the other hand, which would lead to inhibition of NF-κB translocation, showed reduced Akt phosphorylation compared with control cells that overexpressed lacZ (Fig.4C). To rule out the possibility that the stimulatory effect of p65 on Akt was restricted to NIH3T3 cells, we performed a similar experiment using the HEK293 cell line. As shown in Fig. 4D, stimulation of Akt phosphorylation by p65 was seen in HEK293 cells also. When TNFα was applied to cells overexpressing p65, the induction of Akt phosphorylation was not higher than that seen with p65 alone, suggesting that similar mechanisms were involved in the stimulatory effects of p65 and TNFα (Fig. 4E). Interestingly, in addition to inducing Akt phosphorylation, overexpression of p65 caused an increase in the level of total Akt expression in both NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells (Fig. 4, A, C, and D). The overexpression of IκB-α reduced Akt expression to a level slightly below that seen in lacZ-expressing cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In addition to increasing the level of Akt protein, overexpression of p65 caused an increase in Akt mRNA, ruling out post-translational mechanisms as responsible for the stimulatory effect of p65 (Fig.5A). As a step toward determining whether the increase in Akt expression occurred at the transcriptional level as opposed to increasing mRNA stability, we expressed Akt using a CMV-driven promoter. As shown in Fig.5B, although the expression of endogenously produced Akt is increased by p65 overexpression, the level of Akt produced via a CMV promoter is unchanged by p65, arguing against increased mRNA as the mechanism by which Akt expression is stimulated. To examine the time course of Akt induction following p65 expression, we transfected NIH3T3 cells with CMV-p65 and examined the effect on Akt expression and phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.6, A and B, although the increase in p65 expression is seen at 12 h, the stimulation of Akt expression occurs at 18 h. The increased phosphorylation of Akt follows the increased level of expression and is detectable at 24 h. Following treatment with a variety of growth factors and cytokines, the phosphorylation of Akt is mediated by a PI-3 kinase-dependent mechanism (15Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 16Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, therefore, treatment with the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin inhibits TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation and activity (Fig.7A). However, the increased DNA binding activity of NF-κB following TNFα treatment is not substantially reduced by wortmannin or by LY294002, two specific inhibitors of PI-3 kinase, even when used at relatively high concentrations (Fig. 7B). Similarly, translocation of p65 to the nucleus and reduction of IκB-α levels in the cytoplasm is not affected by wortmannin (Fig. 7C). This observation is consistent with Akt being downstream of NF-κB in the sequence of events activated by TNFα, and it places PI-3 kinase in between NF-κB and Akt. To gain insight into the mechanism by which TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation stimulates Akt phosphorylation, we examined the effect of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. As shown in Fig.8, both actinomycin D and cycloheximide prevented the increase in Akt phosphorylation by TNFα, suggesting the need for new gene expression.FIG. 8Inhibitors of gene expression block TNF-induced Akt phosphorylation. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Act D) or 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) in the absence or presence of 10 ng/ml TNFα. Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against phospho-Akt and total Akt. A 1-h pretreatment with the inhibitors was included before addition of TNFα.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Akt generally refers to Akt1, one of three known members of the Akt gene family (15Kandel E.S.

Although it is likely that the three Akt proteins have at least some non-overlapping functions, these have yet to be fully understood. It is known that mice lacking Akt1 have defects in the induction of apoptosis and are growth-retarded (27Chen W.S., Xu, P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R.

To examine whether p65 also increases expression of Akt2 and Akt3, we used antibodies specific for these two forms in Western blot analysis. In contrast to its effect on Akt, p65 had no discernible effect on the expression of Akt2 and Akt3 (Fig.9). Our results indicate that NF-κB is involved in the stimulation of Akt activity. NF-κB-activating stimuli such as TNFα and LPS also stimulate Akt phosphorylation and activity. Events necessary for the activation of NF-κB (such as IκB degradation, nuclear translocation, and increase in NF-κB DNA binding) all occur before the increase in phosphorylation of Akt is detectable. TNFα-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Akt is blocked by two independent pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB. Finally, overexpression of p65 leads to higher Akt phosphorylation, whereas similar overexpression of IκB-α inhibits it. The stimulatory effect of NF-κB on Akt is not restricted to cell lines and is seen in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons. The mechanism by which NF-κB activates Akt phosphorylation is unclear. Our finding that the stimulation of Akt by TNFα can be blocked by inhibitors of gene transcription and translation suggest the requirement for the synthesis of new proteins, an event likely regulated by the activation of NF-κB. Several recent reports have described that NF-κB activation by TNFα is mediated by Akt. Contrary to the findings of Ozes et al.(5Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar) and consistent with the findings of other groups (6Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

It does, however, inhibit Akt phosphorylation by TNFα efficiently, as reported previously (5Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B.

Assuming that the three molecules are part of a common TNF-activated signaling cascade, our results place PI-3 kinase upstream of Akt but downstream of NF-κB. Other studies have shown that the expression of dominant-negative Akt fails to reduce NF-κB translocation or DNA binding activity (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 13Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Akt overexpression by itself is unable to activate NF-κB translocation in the absence of TNFα (7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find that overexpression of p65 in the absence of any extracellular signals is capable of robustly stimulating Akt phosphorylation. While not ruling out the possibility that Akt activates NF-κB as reported previously (5Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 6Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar, 7Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), our results indicate that Akt can be a downstream target of NF-κB. Interestingly, in addition to stimulating its phosphorylation and activity, overexpression of p65 increases the expression of Akt mRNA and protein. The fact that the level of Akt produced from a CMV promoter is not increased by p65 overexpression suggests that the induction of Akt expression is caused by increased transcription rather than increased mRNA stability. It is not known at this time whether this is a direct effect of NF-κB on the Akt promoter. The delayed activation of Akt following p65 overexpression raises the possibility that other intermediary proteins are involved. In contrast to the overexpression of 65, which induces both expression and phosphorylation of Akt, treatment with TNFα stimulates Akt phosphorylation only. The reason for this difference presently is not known, but it may be related to the level of p65 expression. In contrast to transient transfection, which produces large quantities of p65, TNFα treatment results in a relatively modest translocation of p65. Moreover, in contrast to the sustained production of p65 by transfection, TNF-mediated stimulation of NF-κB is transient. The physiological relevance of increased Akt production in response to sustained p65 overexpression is therefore unclear. It is noteworthy, however, that sustained up-regulation of NF-κB has been observed to occur in some cancers as discussed below. It would be of interest to examine whether in such cancers the expression and activity of Akt are also elevated. NF-κB can directly activate proto-oncogenes such as cyclinD1 and c-Myc (29Duyao M.P.

Moreover, chromosomal amplification, overexpression, and rearrangement of genes coding for NF-κB proteins have been found to occur in many human hematopoietic and solid tumors, and the high constitutive activity of NF-κB noted in Hodgkin's lymphoma has been attributed to a mutation in the IκB-α gene (reviewed in Ref. 31Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In addition to providing a direct stimulus toward proliferation, NF-κB can contribute to the development of cancer by suppressing apoptosis, and several anti-apoptotic genes whose expression is activated by NF-κB have been identified, including those encoding cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, manganese superoxide dismutase, A20, and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bfl-1/A1 and Bcl-XL (reviewed in Ref. 4Bours V.

We now show that another downstream target of NF-κB is Akt. Given the established role of Akt in the inhibition of apoptosis and its direct involvement in certain cancers such as ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and gastric adenocarcinomas (reviewed in Ref. 17Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), the activation of Akt by NF-κB may serve as a powerful stimulus in the development or progression of cancer.

Mutations in BSEP result in progressive intrahepatic cholestasis, a severe liver disease that impairs bile flow and causes irreversible liver damage. BSEP is a target for inhibition and down-regulation by drugs and abnormal bile salt metabolites, and such inhibition and down-regulation may result in bile acid retention and intrahepatic cholestasis. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the regulation of BSEP expression by FXR ligands in primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. We demonstrate that BSEP expression is dramatically regulated by ligands of the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Both the endogenous FXR agonist chenodeoxycholate (CDCA) and synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 effectively increased BSEP mRNA in both cell types. This up-regulation was readily detectable at as early as 3 h, and the ligand potency for BSEP regulation correlates with the intrinsic activity on FXR. These results suggest BSEP as a direct target of FXR and support the recent report that the BSEP promoter is transactivated by FXR. In contrast to CDCA and GW4064, lithocholate (LCA), a hydrophobic bile acid and a potent inducer of cholestasis, strongly decreased BSEP expression. Previous studies did not identify LCA as an FXR antagonist ligand in cells, but we show here that LCA is an FXR antagonist with partial agonist activity in cells. In an in vitro co-activator association assay, LCA decreased CDCA- and GW4064-induced FXR activation with an IC50 of 1 μm. In HepG2 cells, LCA also effectively antagonized GW4064-enhanced FXR transactivation. These data suggest that the toxic and cholestatic effect of LCA in animals may result from its down-regulation of BSEP through FXR. Taken together, these observations indicate that FXR plays an important role in BSEP gene expression and that FXR ligands may be potential therapeutic drugs for intrahepatic cholestasis.

Cells were then incubated with various concentrations of CDCA and GW4064 in phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% charcoal-stripped FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 mm HEPES for various periods of time as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells using the TRIZOL reagent according the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and dissolved in water. RNA concentration was determined by a spectrophotometer. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for human BSEP and Cyp 7a were designed using the Primer Express program and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). These sequences (5′ to 3′) are as follows: human BSEP, forward primer (GGGCCATTGTACGAGATCCTAA), probe (6FAM-TCTTGCTACTAGATGAAGCCACTTCTGCCTTAGA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (TGCACCGTCTTTTCACTTTCTG); human Cyp 7a, forward primer (GAGAAGGCAAACGGGTGAAC), probe (6FAM-TGGATTAATTCCATACCTGGGCTGTGCTCT-TAMRA), and reverse primer (GGTATGACAAGGGATTTGTGATGA); human Cyp 3A4, forward primer (GCAGGAGGAAATTGATGCAGTT), probe (6FAM-ACCCAATAAGGCACCACCCACCTATGA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (GTCAAGATACTCCATCTGTAGCACAGT). Primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. Reverse transcription reactions and TaqMan-PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of FAM (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S mRNA. Levels of BSEP, Cyp 7a, and Cyp 3A4 mRNA were expressed as -fold difference of ligand-treated cells against Me2SO-treated cells. To determine whether BSEP is a target of FXR, HepG2 cells were treated with various doses of CDCA for 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. BSEP mRNA levels were analyzed at each time point by TaqMan-PCR. Consistent with previous reports, HepG2 cells expressed very low levels of BSEP with an average threshold cycle of 40 in untreated cells (data not shown). CDCA treatment greatly increased BSEP mRNA production in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximum (EC50) of 10–30 μm and a maximum induction of 500–600-fold (Fig. 1, A–E). Up-regulation of BSEP was readily detectable within 3 h with a maximum induction of 20-fold (Fig. 1A), which increased to 120-fold at 6 h and 250-fold at 12 h (Fig.1, B and C). 24-h treatment yielded a 400-fold induction (Fig. 1D), which increased slightly at 48 h (Fig. 1E). The EC50 at each of the time points was around 10–30 μm, which correlates with the EC50 of CDCA in the FXR transactivation assay (Fig.6B). This correlation, together with the observation that BSEP up-regulation by CDCA was readily detectable at 3 h, suggests that BSEP is a direct target of FXR.FIG. 6Effect of LCA on FXR transactivation.HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates) were transfected with 0.405 μl of FuGENE6, 3 ng of pcDNA3.1-GAL4-hFXR (LBD) expression vector, 3 ng of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα expression construct, 60 ng of pUAS(5X)-tk-LUC reporter vector, and 60 ng of pCMV-lacZ in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were treated with various concentrations of LCA (A), CDCA (B), or GW4064 (C). LCA treatment was also carried out in the presence of 100 nm GW4064 (D) to determine the antagonist activity. After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested, and the cell lysate was used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described under “Materials and Methods.” Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities individually for each well. Each value represents the mean ± S.D. of six determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) GW4064 was reported to be a potent and selective synthetic agonist of FXR (26Willson T.M. Jones S.A. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Med. Res. Rev. 2001; 21: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To further confirm that BSEP up-regulation was mediated by FXR, HepG2 cells were treated with GW4064 for 24 h and assayed for BSEP expression. Similar to the results of CDCA treatment, GW4064 also robustly increased BSEP mRNA in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of about 0.1 μm (Fig.2). This value also correlates with its potency in FXR transactivation (Fig. 6C). This result, together with the result of CDCA treatment, suggests that BSEP up-regulation is mediated by FXR and that BSEP is a direct FXR target. Since HepG2 cells expressed low levels of BSEP, primary human hepatocytes were also investigated for BSEP gene regulation by FXR ligands. The basal expression of BSEP in primary hepatocytes was more than 1000-fold higher than that in HepG2 (data not shown). Despite the relatively high basal level, BSEP expression in primary hepatocytes was further induced by GW4064 in a dose-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 0.1 μm (Fig. 3A). The induction of BSEP expression by CDCA and GW4064 was time-dependent (Fig. 3B). Similar to the results in HepG2, the up-regulation of BSEP in primary hepatocytes was readily detectable at 3 h with a 1.5–2-fold induction (Fig.3B). During the period of 3–48 h, BSEP induction showed a linear increase with time. The induction reached 8–9-fold for CDCA and 10–12-fold for GW4064 (Fig. 3B) at 48 h. LCA, a hydrophobic bile acid with a single hydroxy group at position 3, is a potent inducer of cholestasis when administered to animals (8Fisher M.M. Magnusson R. Miyai K. Lab. Invest. 1971; 25: 88-91PubMed Google Scholar, 9Javitt N.B. Nature. 1996; 210: 1262-1263Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the cholestatic effect of LCA could result from down-regulation of BSEP expression. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were treated with LCA in the presence or absence of GW4064, and BSEP expression was analyzed by TaqMan-PCR. In the absence of GW4064, LCA alone slightly increased BSEP mRNA to a maximum of 16-fold (Fig. 4A). This is about 5% of the maximal stimulation of BSEP mRNA by CDCA (Fig. 1D). This partial stimulation is consistent with the partial agonist activity of LCA in FXR transactivation (Fig.6A). Treatment of HepG2 with 100 nm GW4064 alone resulted in an induction of BSEP expression by 350-fold (Fig. 4B). This induction was effectively decreased by LCA in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximum inhibition (IC50) of 10–20 μm (Fig. 4B). LCA inhibited GW4064-induced BSEP expression by 90% at 30 μm (Fig. 4B). At concentrations above 30 μm, LCA treatment caused cell toxicity (data not shown). Although previous studies did not identify LCA as an FXR ligand, we reasoned that inhibition of BSEP expression by LCA was mediated through FXR. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based FXR co-activator association assay was set up and used to determine LCA activities on FXR in vitro. This assay measures ligand-dependent association of FXR with the co-activator SRC-1 (see “Materials and Methods”). In the agonist mode, LCA alone failed to activate FXR (Fig.5A). As a control, CDCA activated FXR with an EC50 of 8 μm (Fig.5A). In the antagonist mode, LCA decreased CDCA- or GW4064-induced FXR activation with an IC50 of 0.7 and 1.4 μm, respectively (Fig. 5, B and C). These results demonstrate that LCA is indeed a bona fideantagonist ligand of FXR. The FXR antagonist activity of LCA was also confirmed in HepG2 cells using the Gal4-based FXR transactivation assay. LCA alone partially activated FXR with a maximal activation of 35-fold at 40 μm (Fig.6A). In parallel experiments, CDCA activated FXR with a maximum of 1300-fold (Fig. 6B). Thus, LCA has less than 5% of the agonist activity of CDCA. This partial agonist activity of LCA may explain the partial induction of BSEP by LCA in HepG2 (Fig. 3A). Compared with CDCA, GW4064 was a superagonist of FXR, with a maximum induction of 2800-fold and an EC50 of 100–200 nm (Fig. 6C). In the antagonist assay, consistent with the in vitroresults, LCA effectively antagonized GW4064-induced FXR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 20–30 μm (Fig. 6D). These results indicate again that LCA is an antagonist ligand of FXR. It is well known that FXR agonists inhibit transcription of Cyp 7a. LCA, although an FXR antagonist, significantly inhibited Cyp 7a expression in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50of 20 μm (Fig.7A). This inhibition reached 90% at 30 μm. As a control, CDCA effectively decreased Cyp 7a mRNA production (Fig. 7B). The extent of Cyp 7a inhibition by LCA cannot fully be explained by its partial agonist activity (less than 5% of CDCA) on FXR. Indeed, two recent publications identified LCA as a PXR/SXR agonist, and PXR activation also results in repression of Cyp 7a expression (27Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 3375-3380Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the observed Cyp 7a down-regulation by LCA involves pathways in addition to FXR activation. To eliminate the possibility that BSEP regulation by LCA could be mediated through PXR, rifampicin, a PXR-specific ligand (29Kikuchi H. Nippon Eiseigaku Zasshi. 2002; 56: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 30Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 359-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used to treat HepG2 cells and was examined for its effects on BSEP transcription. Rifampicin had no activities on FXR in co-activator association assay and FXR transactivation (data not shown). As predicted, rifampicin alone did not change BSEP expression (Fig.8A). In contrast to LCA, rifampicin did not decrease GW4064-induced BSEP mRNA (Fig.8B). In the same experiment, rifampicin increased Cyp 3A4 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8C), indicating activation of PXR by rifampicin, since Cyp 3A4 is a direct target of PXR (31Pascussi J.M.

These results suggest that PXR is not involved in BSEP regulation and further support the conclusion that the down-regulation of BSEP by LCA is mediated through the antagonist activity on FXR. BSEP is a major bile acid transporter. BSEP expression is critically important for maintenance of bile flow and protecting the liver from bile acid toxicity. It has been reported that BSEP is up-regulated by dexamethasone and hypoosmolarity and down-regulated by endotoxin (33Warskulat U. Kubitz R. Wettstein M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Haussinger D. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1273-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the regulation of endogenous BSEP expression by various FXR ligands in primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 by TaqMan-PCR. We demonstrate that BSEP expression in both cell types is up-regulated by the FXR agonists CDCA and GW4064 in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. BSEP up-regulation was readily detectable at as early as 3 h in both HepG2 and primary hepatocytes. The ligand potency for BSEP regulation correlates well with the ligand in vitro potencies on FXR. All of these data suggest BSEP as a direct target of FXR. Consistent with our results, Ananthanarayanan et al. (20Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) recently reported that the BSEP promoter contains an FXR response element (IR-1) and that FXR directly binds to the BSEP promoter. Indeed, BSEP expression is greatly decreased in FXR knockout mice (34Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). We also provide evidence to explain the molecular basis for a long standing issue of LCA-induced cholestasis. LCA effectively down-regulates agonist-dependent BSEP expression. This down-regulation would result in a decreased hepatic bile acid excretion and thus an increased liver bile acid concentration, which in turn could cause intrahepatic cholestasis and liver damage. Furthermore, we show that LCA is an FXR antagonist and that down-regulation of BSEP by LCA is mediated by FXR antagonist activity. Bile acids such as CDCA, deoxycholate, and cholate were previously identified as FXR ligands (10Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J., Tu, H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). CDCA was thought to be the most potent agonist. Here, we show that LCA binds to FXR with a higher affinity than CDCA in the FXR co-activator association assay. In this assay, LCA acted as a pure antagonist with no detectable agonist activity (Fig. 5A). In the FXR transactivation assay performed in HepG2 cells, LCA acted as an antagonist with partial agonist activity (<5%) (Fig. 6, A and D). We believe that this partial agonist activity resulted in the partial induction of endogenous BSEP expression in HepG2 cells (see Fig.4A). The lack of partial agonist activity in the co-activator association assay may due to 1) co-activator specificity, since only the co-activator SRC-1 was included in the assay, or 2) assay sensitivity. The co-activator association assay had an approximate 10-fold window; however, both FXR transactivation and BSEP mRNA assay had a window of several hundredfold. Thus, co-activator association assay may not be sensitive enough to detect the less than 5% agonist activity of LCA. LCA was recently identified as a PXR/SXR agonist ligand. PXR is thought to be the second bile acid receptor and plays a critical role in liver detoxification (27Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3369-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 28Xie W.

However, there is no evidence supporting the involvement of PXR in BSEP gene regulation. Indeed, the PXR-specific ligand rifampicin did not regulate BSEP expression, suggesting that PXR is not involved in BSEP regulation and further supporting the conclusion that the down-regulation of BSEP by LCA is mediated through the antagonist activity on FXR. BSEP expression is critically important for liver protection. The identification of FXR as an important regulator of BSEP not only provides a molecular mechanism for FXR-mediated BSEP gene regulation but also suggests a potential for FXR ligands as therapeutic drugs for intrahepatic cholestasis and lipid disorders.

Herein, we show that dPGJ2 activates, in cultured primary astrocytes, Erk, Jnk, p38 MAP kinase, and ASK1, a MAP kinase kinase kinase, which can be involved in the activation of Jnk and p38 MAP kinase. The activation kinetic is similar for the three MAP kinase. The activation of the MAP kinases is detectable around 0.5 h. The activation increases with dPGJ2 in a dose dependent manner (0–15 μm). A scavenger of reactive oxygenated species (ROS), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 20 mm, completely suppresses the activation of MAP kinases and ASK1, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in the activation mechanism. Other prostaglandin cyclopentenones than dPGJ2, A2, and to a lesser degree, A1 also stimulate the MAP kinases, although they do not bind to PPARγ. Ciglitazone (20 μm), a thiazolidinedione that mimics several effects of dPGJ2 in different cell types, also activates the three MAP kinase families and ASK1 in cultured astrocytes. However the activation is more rapid (it is detectable at 0.25 h) and more sustained (it is still strong after 4 h). NAC prevents the activation of the three MAP kinase families by ciglitazone. Another thiazolidinedione that binds to PPARγ, rosiglitazone, does not activate MAP kinases, indicating that the effect of ciglitazone on MAP kinases is independent of PPAR γ. Ciglitazone and less strongly dPGJ2 activate Erk in undifferentiated cells of the adipocyte cell line 1B8. Ciglitazone also activates Jnk and p38 MAP kinase in these preadipocytes. Our findings suggest that a part of the biological effects of dPGJ2 and ciglitazone involve the activation of the three MAP kinase families probably through PPARγ-independent mechanisms involving ROS. 15-Deoxy-Δ12–14-prostaglandin J2 (dPGJ2) and thiazolidinediones are known as ligands for the peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARγ) a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.

It has been suggested that much of the effects of dPGJ2 and thiazolidinediones may be mediated by this receptor. However, Rossiet al. (6Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) have shown that dPGJ2 also can directly inhibit the IKKβ subunit of IKK, the protein kinase responsible for the activation of NFκB by proinflammatory stimuli. This effect of dPGJ2 can be mimicked by other prostaglandin cyclopentenones and is clearly independent of PPARγ. dPGJ2 also activates Erk cascade in mesangial cells in a manner probably independent of PPARγ as ciglitazone does not mimic this effect (7Wilmer W.A. Dixon C., Lu, L. Hilbelink T. Rovin B.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the cellular model studied by our group, rat cultured astrocytes, which express PPARγ, we observed (this paper) 2A. M. Lennon, M. Ramaugé, A. Dessouroux, and M. Pierre, unpublished results.2A. M. Lennon, M. Ramaugé, A. Dessouroux, and M. Pierre, unpublished results. that dPGJ2 promotes apoptosis and prevents the induction of thyroid hormone deiodinases, enzymes strongly induced by signals activating protein kinase A or protein kinase C (8Courtin F. Chantoux F. Pierre M. Francon J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1577-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Courtin F. Liva P. Gavaret J.M. Toru-Delbauffe D. Pierre M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 54: 1056-1061Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of action of dPGJ2, we examined the signaling pathways activated by this prostaglandin, and we focused on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascades. Three MAP kinase families have been identified in mammalian cells: the extracellular regulated kinases (Erks), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (Jnks), and the p38 MAPKs (for review, see Ref. 10Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 122-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MAP kinases transduce information into the different compartments of the cell. The three MAP kinase families have different downstream targets that they phosphorylate on serine and threonine residues located adjacent to proline residues. The three MAP kinase families are activated by upstream dual-specificity kinases (MAP kinase kinases) phosphorylating threonine and tyrosine residues in a threonine-X-tyrosine site specific for each MAP kinase family. MAP kinase kinases are activated by specific MAP kinase kinase kinases. The three MAP kinase families are activated in response to various stimuli. The Erk family is activated preferentially by growth factors usually acting through a Ras-Raf-dependent cascade, while Jnk and p38 MAPK families are preferentially activated by stress and cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor α family. However, the specificity of activating stimuli is relative, depending on the cell type. For example, in astrocytes Erk is strongly activated by a number of stress factors including oxidative stress (11Tournier C. Thomas G. Pierre J. Jacquemin C. Pierre M. Saunier B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). 3M. Pierre, unpublished observations.3M. Pierre, unpublished observations. We found that dPGJ2 and the thiazolidinedione ciglitazone activate the MAP kinase cascades in astrocytes and in preadipocytes. We demonstrated that (i) ROS generation is required for this effect, (ii) the effect of dPGJ2 on MAP kinases is mimed by other prostaglandin cyclopentenones that do not bind to PPARγ, and (iii) the effect of ciglitazone on MAP kinases was not mimed by an other thiazolidinedione ligand of PPARγ, rosiglitazone.

Brain Res. 1989; 45: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, astroglial cells were obtained from the cerebral hemispheres of 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. They were plated in 10-cm2 dishes and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in DMEM, supplemented with: 6 g/liter glucose, 2.4 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/liter streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/liter amphotericin B), and 10% FCS. The medium was changed every 2–3 days until the cells reached confluence at about 10 days. The cells were further cultured for a week, with daily changes, in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5.2 g/liter glucose, 1.8 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and the antibiotics listed above. Ninety-five percent of these cells contained, as we have described previously (13Esfandiari A. Gavaret J.M. Lennon A.M. Pierre M. Courtin F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2086-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the immunoreactive glial fibrillary acidic protein, a specific marker of astrocytes. The immortalized mouse adipocyte cell line, termed 1B8, was grown in standard adipocyte culture medium supplemented with 10% FCS (14Larose M. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Fleury C. Serra F. Champigny O. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31533-31542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) until confluence (preadipocytes). After cells reached confluence, FCS content was reduced to 5% and supplemented with 1 nmtriiodothyronine and 20 nm insulin until complete differentiation into adipocytes about 1 week later (15Klaus S. Choy L. Champigny O. Cassard-Doulcier A.M. Ross S. Spiegelman B. Ricquier D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The serum concentration was reduced to 0.5% for 24 h in the culture medium of adipocytes and preadipocytes before treatment by dPGJ2 and ciglitazone. The protein content of the samples in Laemmli buffer (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) was determined by the method of Mc Knight (17Mc Knight S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cultures were treated with different agents, and at the end of the incubation period, cells were scraped off in Laemmli buffer. Identical amounts of proteins from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes by semidry transfer. The membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.1% Tween. Immunodetections were performed by incubating the PVDF membrane with antibodies in PBS, 0.1% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin. Three antibodies were directed against the phosphorylated forms (active forms) of MAP kinases: anti-active Erk (P-Erk) (1/5000), anti-active Jnk (P-Jnk) (1/5000), and anti-active p38 MAPK (P-p38) (1/2000). Another antibody was directed against and ASK1 (1/1000). Detection of antigen-antibodies complexes was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the revelation was made by chemiluminescence reaction. All the experiments were repeat at least three times. Apoptosis was evaluated by nuclear staining with DAPI. Cells were treated with the different agents for 24 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml). Nuclei were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei of apoptotic cells showed characteristic morphological changes (condensation and fragmentation). Apoptotic cells and nonapoptotic cells were counted. The results are expressed as percent of apoptotic cells Activation of Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase was observed after addition of dPGJ2 to cultured astrocytes. The activation kinetic obtained with 15 μmdPGJ2 was similar for the three MAP kinases (Fig.1A). This activation was delayed about half an hour and reached its maximum after 2 h. Then, the activation declined and returned to the basal level after 6 h. The vehicle, 0.1% Me2SO did not stimulate the MAP kinases. The MAP kinase activation was concentration dependent. Fig. 1B shows the activation of Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase after addition of increasing concentrations of dPGJ2 (0–15 μm) to cultured astrocytes for 2 h. For each MAP kinase family, the maximum activation was obtained at 15 μm dPGJ2. For a number of stimuli (18Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K.

Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), activation of MAP kinases requires the generation of reactive oxygenated species (ROS). Accumulation of ROS can be prevented by NAC, a scavenger of ROS. Cultured astrocytes were pretreated 15 min with 20 mm NAC before the addition of dPGJ2 (15 μm) to the culture medium. Fig.1C shows that NAC completely prevents the activation of MAP kinases by dPGJ2, suggesting that the formation of ROS is involved. NAC does not affect the phosphorylation of MAP kinases in unstimulated cells (not shown). dPGJ2 contains an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentane ring structure like prostaglandins A and other prostaglandins J. These prostaglandins are named prostaglandin cyclopentenones, and most of them share various biological effects (25Santoro M.G. Experientia (Basel). 1994; 50: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), although several of them, like prostaglandins A, do not bind PPARγ. We tested whether prostaglandins A also activate MAP kinase cascades. Fig. 2 shows that both prostaglandins A2 and A1 are able to activate MAP kinases. However, they are weaker activators than dPGJ2. NAC also inhibits MAP kinase activation by prostaglandins A1 and A2. As reported for other cells, the thiazolidinedione ciglitazone promoted similar effects on astrocytes than dPGJ2. By example, ciglitazone induced apoptosis like dPGJ2, although its effect was slower than that of dPGJ2 (Table I). These observations prompted us to examine the effect of ciglitazone on MAP kinase cascades.Table IEffects of dPGJ2 and ciglitazone on cell deathTreatment% apoptosisControl6.90 ± 3.5dPGJ2 (15 μm)84.4 ± 14.7Ciglitazone (20 μm)15.9 ± 5.14 Open table in a new tab Activation of Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase was observed after addition of 20 μm ciglitazone to cultured astrocytes (Fig.3A). The kinetic was similar for the three families of MAP kinases. Activation was detectable after 15 min and was sustained for several hours. The vehicle, 0.1% Me2SO, did not stimulate the MAP kinases as shown in Fig 1A. In this particular experiment, two forms of activated p38 MAP kinase were seen clearly, although in most of the experiments only one form was easily detectable. Also, in some experiments, an additional minor band was visible. We have not established the reason of these variations. The MAP kinase activation by ciglitazone is concentration-dependent. Fig. 3B shows the activation of Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase after addition of increasing concentrations of ciglitazone (0–20 μm) to cultured astrocytes for 2 h. For each MAP kinase family, the maximum activation was obtained with 20 μmciglitazone. Cultured astrocytes were pretreated for 15 min with 20 mmNAC before the addition of ciglitazone (20 μm) to the culture medium. Fig. 3C shows that NAC reduces the activation of MAP kinases by ciglitazone. As we have shown previously (24Lennon A.M. Ramaugé M. Pierre M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), the MAP kinase kinase kinase ASK1, which can promote the activation of Jnk and p38 MAP kinase, is expressed in cultured astrocytes. The rate of migration on SDS-PAGE of ASK1 from stressed cells is decreased, which probably means that it is activated. Fig.4 shows that ASK1 from cultured astrocytes treated with ciglitazone or dPGJ2 also shifts on SDS-PAGE. In astrocytes treated with dPGJ2, all the molecules of ASK1 clearly shifted. This shift promoted by dPGJ2 is prevented by NAC. In astrocytes treated by ciglitazone, only a fraction of ASK1 molecules shifted, and this was not clearly prevented by NAC. These observations show that ASK1 is probably activated in astrocytes by ciglitazone or dPGJ2, but that the mechanisms of activation may be different. The effect of rosiglitazone on MAP kinase cascades was studied and compared with that of ciglitazone. Astrocytes were incubated with various concentrations of rosiglitazone (2–20 μm) for 2 h. Astrocytes were also incubated with 20 μm rosiglitazone for various times (0.5–6 h). In all cases, no activation of MAP kinases was detected, although ciglitazone in the same cultures promoted a strong activation of MAP kinases. Fig.5 illustrates the difference of the effects of ciglitazone and rosiglitazone on MAP kinase cascades. Observations made with astrocytes prompted us to examine whether ciglitazone and dPGJ2 also activate the MAP kinase cascades in preadipocytes known to differentiate into adipocytes after treatment with ciglitazone or dPGJ2. Preadipocytes of the cell line 1B8, maintained in an undifferenciated state (see “Methods”), were incubated with ciglitazone (20 μm) or dPGJ2 (15 μm) for 2 h, conditions that promoted a strong activation of MAP kinases in cultured astrocytes. The activation of MAP kinases was monitored by Western blot. Fig.6A shows that ciglitazone strongly activated Erk but also p38 MAP kinase and Jnk. dPGJ2 less strongly activated Erk and did not stimulate Jnk and p38 MAP kinase. These observations suggest that MAP kinase activation, particularly Erk activation, could play a role in the action of ciglitazone and dPGJ2. Note that neither ciglitazone nor dPGJ2 activated MAP kinases in differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 6B). We show that dPGJ2 and ciglitazone both promote the activation of MAP kinases (Erk, Jnk, and p38 MAP kinase) in cultured astrocytes and preadipocytes. Ciglitazone and dPGJ2 are known as ligands of PPARγ, and their effects on MAP kinases might be mediated by this nuclear receptor. However, some works suggest that dPGJ2 and thiazolidinediones also may act by a nongenomic mechanism. By example Chawla et al. (26Chawla A. Barak Y. Nagy L. Liao D. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) have obtained PPARγ deficient macrophages by using embryonic stem cells from mice deficient of PPARγ, and PPARγ ligands still exert anti-inflammatory effects in these macrophages. Our results indicate that the activation of MAP kinase cascades by dPGJ2 and ciglitazone in astrocytes probably involves PPARγ-independent mechanisms, because a classical ligand of PPARγ as rosiglitazone does not activate MAP kinases. Today, from the examination of the structures of these molecules (ciglitazone and roziglitazone), we are not able to explain their different effect on MAP kinase activation. The observation that prostaglandins A2 and A1, which do not bind PPARγ but are prostaglandin cyclopentenones like dPGJ2, also activate MAP kinase cascades is also in favor of PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Our results implicates that, to promote their biological effects, some thiazolidinediones act only through PPARγ-dependent mechanisms, while other thiazolidinediones act through PPARγ-dependent and -independent mechanisms. MAP kinases might be elements of the PPARγ-independent mechanisms. Examination of the activation kinetic of MAP kinases shows that the effect of ciglitazone and dPGJ2 is rather rapid. Activation is easily detectable within 30 min after addition of dPGJ2 to the culture medium and after 15 min for ciglitazone. Maximum is reached after 2 h. Activation is more sustained with ciglitazone than with dPGJ2. This difference may be due to a different stability of these molecules in the culture medium, but other explanations are possible. In previous work, we have shown that ASK1, a MAP kinase kinase kinase able to activate Jnk and p38 MAP kinase cascades, is present in astrocytes and is activated by oxidative stress (24Lennon A.M. Ramaugé M. Pierre M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that ASK1 is activated by ciglitazone and dPGJ2, but that the activation of ASK1 by ciglitazone is not complete and is not blocked by NAC. However, the activation of Jnk and p38 MAP kinase by ciglitazone and dPGJ2, like the activation of Erk, requires ROS, because the activation of all these cascades is prevented in the presence of the ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine. To explain that, we propose (i) activation of ASK1 by ciglitazone must involve a mechanism insensitive to NAC, and (ii) ciglitazone must activate another MAP kinase kinase kinase able to activate Jnk and p38 MAP kinase by a mechanism sensitive to NAC. The activation of Erk cascade involves MAP kinase kinase kinases different from those able to activate Jnk and p38 MAP kinase cascades (10Murga C. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 122-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Note that the activation of MAP kinases by a number of stressors, including drugs (18Stevenson M.A. Pollock S.S. Coleman C.N. Calderwood S.K.

Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), appears to require ROS, suggesting that the activation of MAP kinases by ROS might be a rather general response to stress factors. ROS (H2O2) is required also for MAP kinase activation by growth factors in some cellular models as vascular smooth muscle cells (27Sundarasen M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar). However, in other cases, the activation of MAP kinases by various stimuli does not require ROS (28Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J.

A role for MAP kinases in the actions of ciglitazone and dPGJ2 can be proposed. Erk is generally considered as an inhibitor of the adipogenesis (30Boney C.M. Gruppuso P.A. Faris R.A. Frackelton A.R., Jr. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This may be due to the inhibition of the transcriptional activity of PPARγ phosphorylated on a consensus site for Erk (31Adams M. Reginato M.J. Shao D. Lazar M.A. Chatterjee V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 272: 5128-5132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that p38 MAP kinase is required for the first steps of adipogenesis (32Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lin A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35630-35638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAP kinase by ciglitazone in preadipocytes, as we have observed, can play a role in initiating their differentiation into adipocytes. Activation of Erk (by dPGJ2 and ciglitazone) can potentiate the proliferation of preadipocytes before the initiation of their differentiation. In astrocytes, preadipocytes, and likely in other cell types, the activation of the three families of MAP kinases by dPGJ2 and ciglitazone must affect the expression of a number of genes involved in various cellular functions, because each MAP kinase cascade is known to control the expression of several genes. dPGJ2 also can act by inhibiting the NFκB pathway (6Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), considered by many authors as a survival pathway. Consequently, depending on the cell types and environmental conditions, these drugs can affect multiplication, cell death, and differentiated functions. In the case of astrocytes cultured in chemically defined medium (DMEM/F-12), we observed that dPGJ2 and more slowly ciglitazone promoted cell death. An article by Takeda et al. (33Takeda K. Ichiki T. Tokunou T. Iino N. Takeshita A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48950-48955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), published while this manuscript was in preparation, shows that Erk cascade is activated in vascular smooth muscle cells by dPGJ2, pioglitazone, and troglitazone. This work and our work, taken together, show that the activation of MAP kinases by dPGJ2 and some thiazolidinediones can be obtained in various types of cells. The activation of the three MAP kinase families by dPGJ2 and some thiazolidinediones suggests a new concept of the molecular mechanism of action of these drugs. This may drive to use thiazolidinediones in therapeutic treatments for their ability to activate MAP kinases cascades or, contrary to this, to look for a reduction of undesirable side effects.

This study investigates the role of Sp1 protein in mediating hormone-responsiveness in MCF-7 cells using sequence-specific duplexes of 21 nucleotides targeted to Sp1 mRNA as well as Lamin B1 and the heterologous firefly luciferase gene (GL2) mRNAs. Transfection of iRNA for Sp1 (iSp1) decreases (40–60%) the expression of nuclear Sp1 protein in ER-positive MCF-7 and ZR-75 human breast cancer cell extracts. In transfected cells, Sp1 protein is barely detectable by immunofluorescence, and both basal and estrogen-inducible transactivation is decreased in cells transfected with iSp1 and a GC-rich construct. These data, combined with results showing that iSp1 inhibits hormone-induced MCF-7 cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase, demonstrate that ERα/Sp1-mediated transactivation plays a major role in ER-positive breast cancer cell growth. MCF-7 and ZR-75 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). DME/F12 with and without phenol red, 100× antibiotic/antimycotic solution, propidium idodide, and E2 were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Intergen (Purchase, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (300Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Poly(dI-dC) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Antibodies for proteins Sp1, Lamin B1, and ERα proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Human ERα expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai, Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). The pSp13construct contains three consensus Sp1 binding sites and the pERE3 construct contains three EREs. The oligonucleotides were linked to the bacterial luciferase gene and cloned intoBamHI-HindIII-cut XP-2 plasmid obtained from ATCC. Lysis buffer, luciferase reagent, and RNase were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madision, WI). All other chemicals and biochemicals were of the highest quality available from commercial sources. iRNAs were prepared by IDT (Coralville, IA) and targeted the coding region 153–173, 672–694, and 1811–1833 relative to the start codon of GL2, Lamin B1 (LMN), and Sp1 genes, respectively. Single-stranded RNAs were annealed by incubating 20 μm of each strand in annealing buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, 2 mm magnesium acetate) for 1 min at 90 °C followed by 1 h at 37 °C. The iRNA duplexes used in this study are indicated as follows: GL25′­CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGATT­3′3′­TTGCAUGCGCCUUAUGAAGCU­5′LMN15′­AACGCGCUUGGUAGAGGUGGATT­3′3′­TTUUGCGCGAACCAUCUCCACCU­5′Sp15′­AUCACUCCAUGGAUGAAAUGATT­3′3′­TTUAGUGAGGUACCUACUUUACU­5′ Cells were cultured in 6-well plates in 2 ml of DME/F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. After 16–20 h when cells were 50–60% confluent, iRNA duplexes and/or reporter gene constructs were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). The effects of iSp1 on hormone-induced transactivation was investigated in MCF-7 cells treated with 10 nm E2 and cotransfected with pSp13 (500 ng) or pERE3 (500 ng) and ERα expression plasmid (200 ng). Based on the results of preliminary studies, 0.75 μg of iRNA duplex was transfected in each well to give a final concentration of 50 nm. Cells were harvested 36–44 h after transfection by manual scraping in 1× lysis buffer (Promega). For whole cell extracts, cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 s, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using luciferase assay reagent (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using Tropix Galacto-Light Plus assay system (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in a Lumicount microwell plate reader (Packard Instrument Co.). For nuclear extracts, cells were washed in PBS (2×), scraped in 1 ml of 1× lysis buffer, incubated at 4 °C for 15 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 1 min at 20 °C. Cell pellets were initially washed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (3×). Lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm KCl was then added to the cell pellet and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with frequent vortexing. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of supernatant were stored at −80 °C and used for Western blot analysis and gel shift assays. An aliquot of nuclear protein (30 μg) was diluted with loading buffer, boiled, and loaded on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Samples were electrophoresed at 150–180 V for 3–4 h, and separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in buffer containing 48 mm Tris-HCl, 29 mm glycine, and 0.025% SDS. Proteins were detected by incubation with polyclonal primary antibodies Sp1-PEP2, Lamin B1-C20, and ERα-G20 (all 1:1000 dilution) against Sp1, Lamin B1, and ERα proteins, respectively, followed by blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (for Sp1 and ERα) or anti-goat (for Lamin B) secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution). Blots were then exposed to chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and placed in Kodak X-Omat AR autoradiography film. Band intensities were determined by a scanning laser densitometer (Sharp Electronics Corp., Mahwah, NJ) using Zero-D Scanalytics software (Scanalytics Corp., Billerica, MA). Cells were transfected with iRNAs for Sp1 or GL2 and, after 20–24 h, treated with Me2SO or 20 nm E2 for 18–20 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then trypsinized and ∼2 × 106 cells were centrifuged and resuspended after removal of trypsin in 1 ml of staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 4 mm sodium citrate, 30 units/ml RNase, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.8. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and then prior to FACS analysis sodium chloride was added to give a final concentration of 0.15m. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD PharMingen) using CellQuest (BD PharMingen) acquisition software. Propidium iodide fluorescence was collected through a 585/42-nm bandpass filter, and list mode data were acquired on a minimum of 12,000 single cells defined by a dot plot of PI-width versusPI-area. Data analysis was performed in ModFit LT (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) using PI-width versus PI-area to exclude cell aggregates. FlowJo (Treestar, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used to generate plots shown in the figures. Consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (28Castro-Rivera E. Samudio I. Safe S. J. Biol.

A 30-μl EMSA reaction mixture contained ∼100 mm KCl, 3 μg of crude nuclear protein, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), with or without unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, and 10 fmol of radiolabeled probe. After incubation for 20 min on ice, antibodies against Sp1 protein were added and incubated another 20 min on ice. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris borate/EDTA buffer (0.09 mTris-base, 0.09 m boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 120 V at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Specific DNA-protein and antibody-supershifted complexes were observed as retarded bands in the gel. MCF-7 cells were seeded in Lab-Tek Chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at 100,000 cells/well in DME/F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, and after 14 h cells were transferred into serum-free medium for 8–10 h. Cells were then transfected with iRNAs, and after 36–44 h the media chamber was detached and the remaining glass slides were washed in Dulbecco's PBS. After washing, the glass slides were fixed with cold (−20 °C) methanol for 10 min, and then slides were washed in 0.3% PBS/Tween for 5 min (2×) before blocking with 5% rabbit or goat serum in antibody dilution buffer (stock solution: 100 ml of PBS/Tween, 1 g of bovine serum albumin, 45 ml of glycerol, pH 8.0) for 1 h at 20 °C. After removal of the blocking solution, rabbit Sp1-PEP2 or goat Lamin B1 polyclonal antibodies were added in antibody dilution buffer (1:200) and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Slides were washed for 10 min with 0.3% Tween in 0.02 m PBS (3×) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat secondary antibodies (1:1000 dilution) for 2 h at 20 °C. Slides were then washed for 10 min in 0.3% PBS-Tween (4×). Slides were mounted in ProLonged antifading medium (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and cover slips were sealed using Nailslicks nail polish (Noxell Corp., Hunt Valley, MD). Fluorescence imaging was performed using Carlzeiss Axiophoto 2 (Calzeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Images were captured using Adobe Photoshop 5.5 using identical camera settings. Cells were transfected with iSp1 or iGL2 for 36 h, then treated with Me2SO. MCF-7 cells were then collected, suspended in 1× PBS with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and formaldehyde was added to the medium to give a 1% solution that was incubated with shaking for 10 min at 20 °C. Glycine was then added (0.125 m) and, after further incubation for 10 min, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS and 1 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then resuspended in swell buffer (85 mm potassium chloride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin at pH 8.0), homogenized, and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 s. Nuclei were then resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 nm EDTA, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.1) and sonicated for 45–60 s to obtain chromatin with appropriate fragment lengths (500–1000 bp). The sonicated extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C until used. The cross-linked chromatin preparations were diluted in buffer (1% Triton X, 100 mmsodium chloride, 0.5% SDS, 5 mm EDTA and Tris at pH 8.1), and 20 μl of ultralink protein A or G or A/G beads were added per 100 μl of chromatin, and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation, and salmon sperm DNA, specific antibodies, and 20 μl of ultralink beads were added to the supernatant. The mixture was incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. An aliquot was treated at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was precipitated with ethanol. This aliquot was used as an input control. Immunoprecipitated samples were then centrifuged. Beads were resuspended in dialysis buffer, vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 s. Beads were then resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (11 mm Tris, 500 mm lithium chloride, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid at pH 8,0) and vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C. Procedures with the dialysis and immunoprecipitation buffers were repeated (3–4 times), and beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (50 nm NaHCO3, 1% SDS, 1.5 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA), vortexed, and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were then isolated by centrifugation and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse protein-DNA cross-links. Wizard PCR kits (Promega) were used for additional DNA cleanup. A portion of the purified immunoprecipitated DNA and 0.2% of the input control were used for [α-P32]dCTP incorporation PCR. One-fourth of a microliter of [α-P32]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was added to a 25-μl PCR reaction (3% Me2SO), 1 m betaine, and 1.5 mm magnesium chloride) and subjected to one cycle of 95 °C × 5 min, 5 cycles of 95 °C × 30 s, 60 °C × 30 s, 5 cycles of 95 °C × 30 s, 55 °C × 30 s, 72 °C × 30 s, and 5 cycles of 95 °C × 30 s, 48 °C × 30 s, 72 °C × 30 s, followed by one cycle at 72 °C for 4 min. Reactions were loaded on a 10–15% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and exposed to a phosphor screen for 24 h. The primers used for PCR of the GC-rich region of pSp13 are indicated as follows: pxp2-luc-Fw (6128), 5′-GTTTGTCCAAACTCATCAATG-3′; Rv (105), 5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTC-3′. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test, and the levels of probability are noted. The results are expressed as means ± S.D. for at least three separate (replicate) experiments for each treatment. Results of preliminary studies indicate that iSp1 and iLMN were most effective at decreasing cellular protein levels by treating cells for 36–44 h with 0.75 μg of the duplex oligonucleotides. The results illustrated in Fig. 1, A and Bshow that transfection of iSp1 in MCF-7 cells significantly decreased Sp1 protein by ∼60% in nuclear extracts, whereas immunoreactive Lamin B1 and ERα levels were unchanged. In contrast, transfection of iLMN decreased Lamin B1 but not Sp1 or ERα protein levels, thus demonstrating the specificity of the iRNAs. The results summarized in Fig. 1 C confirm that iSp1 (but not iLMN) also significantly decreased Sp1 protein in ERα-positive ZR-75 cells. The effects of iRNAs on nuclear protein levels were also investigated in gel mobility shift assays using extracts from MCF-7 or ZR-75 cells (Fig.2, A and B) and a consensus GC-rich oligonucleotide [32P]Sp1 that binds Sp1 and other Sp1 family proteins. Incubation of nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells with [32P]Sp1 gave a profile of retarded bands (lane 2) associated with Sp1- and Sp3-DNA complexes (28Castro-Rivera E. Samudio I. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30853-30861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The intensity of the former complex was decreased after incubation with unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide (lane 5) and supershifted with Sp1 antibodies (lane 6). In cells transfected with iSp1, there was a decrease in retarded band intensity (lane 4), whereas iLMN did not affect retarded band intensities. The results obtained for ZR-75 cells (Fig. 2 B) were similar to those observed in MCF-7 cells and confirm the effectiveness and specificity of iSp1 for selectively decreasing Sp1 protein in breast cancer cells.Figure 2Binding of [32P]Sp1 with nuclear extracts from breast cancer cells treated with iSp1 or iLMN. MCF-7 (A) or ZR-75 (B) cells were treated with solvent, iSp1, or iLMN, and binding of nuclear extracts to [32P]Sp1 was determined in gel mobility shift assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. MCF-7 cells were transfected with pSp13 and iSp1 or iGL2, and analysis of Sp1 and Sp3 immunoprecipitable complexes associated with the transfected GC-rich construct were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay/PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have also used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to further investigate the in situ effects of iSp1 on Sp1-DNA interactions. MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with iSp1 or iGL2 and a construct containing three tandem GC-rich Sp1 binding sites (pSp13), and after 36–44 h, cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link DNA-bound proteins. After immunoprecipitation with Sp1 or Sp3 antibodies and removal of the cross-links, PCR was used to identify the GC-rich region of pSp13 as part of the immunoprecipitable complexes. The results showed that iSp1 decreased interaction of Sp1 with the GC-rich promoter compared with that observed in cells transfected with iGL2, whereas the intensity of PCR products was similar for Sp3 immunoprecipitable complexes. Thus, results of Western blots, gel mobility shift, and ChIP demonstrate a significant (40–60%) decrease in Sp1 protein in breast cancer cells transfected with iSp1. Transfection with LipofectAMINE results in >40–60% transfection efficiency in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that iSp1 is highly effective in decreasing Sp1 expression in transfected cells. This was further investigated in MCF-7 cells by immunofluorescence analysis of Sp1 or lamin protein in MCF-7 transfected with iSp1 or iLMN (Fig. 3).Panels A and E are control panels where the primary antibody for lamin (panel A) or Sp1 (panel E) has been omitted. Panel C is a control for lamin (iLMN) showing immunofluorescence of Lamin B and phase contrast (panel B). In cells transfected with iLMN, most of the cells exhibited either significantly decreased Lamin B expression (transfected cells) or lamin expression was unchanged (non-transfected cells). Sp1 staining was observed in untreated MCF-7 cells (panel F) or in cells transfected with iLMN (panel G); however, in cells transfected with iSp1, there was a marked decrease of Sp1 staining in most cells, whereas the non-transfected cells were essentially unchanged. These data demonstrate that transfected iSp1 but not iLMN were highly effective in decreasing cellular expression of Sp1, and this accounts for the decreases in Sp1 protein in nuclear extracts (Figs. 1 and 2). The results in Fig. 4 Asummarize the effects of iLMN, iGL2, and iSp1 on luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with pSp13 and the iRNAs. iLMN did not significantly decrease activity, whereas iGL2 (which is targeted to the luciferase mRNA) and iSp1 both inhibited luciferase activity. In this study (Fig. 4, A and B), there was a >60–77% decrease in basal activity in cells transfected with iSp1. Moreover, E2 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with pSp13 as previously described (28Castro-Rivera E. Samudio I. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30853-30861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and in cells cotransfected with iSp1 there was a >80% decrease in hormone-induced transactivation. Thus, iSp1 inhibited both basal and E2 induced luciferase activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with pSp13. In contrast, hormone-induced transactivation in MCF-7 cells transfected with pERE3 was not affected by cotransfection with iLMN or iSp1, whereas iGL2 decreased activity in cells treated with Me2SO or E2 (Fig. 4 C). Thus, iSp1 specifically blocks hormone-induced transactivation in cells transfected with pSp13 but not pERE3. Promoter regions in several genes associated with cell proliferation contain E2-responsive GC-rich motifs (20–31); however, the role of ERα/Sp1 in mediating cell growth can only be inferred from these studies. The role of Sp1 in hormone-induced cell cycle progression was further investigated to determine the effects of iSp1 and iGL2 (a control) on distribution of MCF-7 cells in G0/G1, G2-M, and S phases after treatment with solvent (Me2SO) or 20 nm E2 for 18–20 h. At this time point, iRNA for Sp1 increased the percent of solvent-treated cells in G0/G1 from 75.3 to 78.3% and decreased the percent in S phase (from 15.1 to 12.1). In a parallel study in untreated cells at an earlier time point (8–10 h), a 5% decrease in cells in S phase and a similar increase in cells in G0/G1 was observed (data not shown). More dramatic changes were observed for the effects of iSp1 on E2-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells. For example, in cells treated with Me2SO or 20 nm E2, the percent of cells in G0/G1:S phase was 75.3:9.57% or 66.1:23.7%, respectively, showing a dramatic increase in G0/G1 → S progression after treatment with E2, and this has been observed in other studies (43Foster J.S. Wimalasena J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 44Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast, the percent of cells in G0/G1:S phase in cells treated with iSp1 was 71.9:17.3%, indicating that hormone-induced cell cycle progression was markedly decreased by ablating cellular expression of Sp1 protein, whereas transfection of the control iGL2 did not affect cell cycle progression. These results demonstrate for the first time that Sp1 protein and ERα/Sp1-mediated transactivation are important for hormone-induced proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The development of genetic technologies to regulate or delete expression of endogenous genes has been extensively used to probe the role of specific genes on biological function. For example, the generation of knock-out/knock-in mice and the overexpression of genes in transgenic animal models has provided unique insights on gene function in normal physiology and disease processes. RNA interference by double-stranded RNA involves the sequence-specific post-transcriptional silencing of genes that has been widely described and used in plants and animals (37Fire A. Trends.

This study has used the iRNA approach for investigating the role of Sp1 protein in the growth and hormone-responsiveness of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Although Sp1 is important for basal transcription of genes involved in cell growth, expression of several cell cycle-regulated genes such as dihydrofolate reductase and hypoxanthine/guanine phosphoribosyl transferase were unaffected in gestation day 8.5-day-old embryos (5Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Phillipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In contrast, transfection of GC-rich Sp1 oligonucleotide decoys into A549 human lung adenocarcinoma and U251 human glioblastoma cells blocked expression of several genes with GC-rich promoters and suppressed cell growth. This approach and others that target GC-rich sequences suggest that Sp1 protein may play an important role in cell growth (45Ishibashi H. Nakagawa K. Onimaru M. Castellanous E.J. Kaneda Y. Nakashima Y. Shirasuna K. Sueishi K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6531-6536PubMed Google Scholar, 46Martin B. Vaquero A. Priebe W. Portugal J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3402-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, these techniques lack specificity because multiple Sp family proteins bind GC-rich motifs that may influence the function of other DNA-bound transcription factors. Research in this laboratory has identified E2-responsive GC-rich motifs in promoters of several genes involved in cell proliferation, and these include cyclin D1, thymidylate synthase, c-fos, E2F1, bcl2, and DNA polymerase α (20–31). Several approaches were previously used to demonstrate the role of ERα/Sp1 as a transcription factor complex, and this study was designed to further investigate this non-classical mechanism of estrogen action and its involvement in hormone-induced transactivation and cell proliferation. The results in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 clearly demonstrate that transfected iSp1 was highly effective for decreasing expression of Sp1 protein in nuclear extracts, and, not surprisingly, immunofluorescence studies indicate that Sp1 protein is barely detectable in transfected cells (Fig. 3). The high efficiency of iSp1 for ablating Sp1 protein in transfected cells was observed in MCF-7 cells cotransfected with iSp1 and pSp13, an E2-responsive GC-rich construct that serves as a surrogate for other GC-rich E2-responsive gene promoters (Fig. 4). In these transfection studies, iSp1 significantly decreased both basal and E2-induced luciferase activities confirming the role of ERα/Sp1 in ligand-activated transcription. Treatment of growth-arrested MCF-7 cells with E2 results in cell cycle progression that is characterized by a decrease in cells in G0/G1 and an increase in cells in S phase (43Foster J.S. Wimalasena J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar,44Prall O.W.J. Sarcevic B. Musgrove E.A. Watts C.K.W. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10882-10894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). In untreated cells, iSp1 further increased the percent of cells in G0/G1(from 75.3 to 78.3%) and decreased the number of cell in S phase (from 15.1 to 12.1%). Because FACS analysis was carried out on the total cell population (transfected and non-transfected), the response of MCF-7 cells to transfected iSp1 demonstrates the important role of Sp1-regulated genes in basal growth of these cells. The effects of iSp1 were more dramatic in reversing hormone-induced cell cycle progression and blocking a high proportion of these cells from progression to S phase. These data are consistent with the results of previous studies showing that cyclin D1 and other genes important for cell proliferation are regulated by ERα/Sp1 (21Wang W. Dong L. Saville B. Safe S.

Future studies will use iRNAs to further investigate the role of Sp1, other Sp-like proteins, and coregulatory factors on the growth of MCF-7 and other hormone-dependent cell lines and to identify key genes that are integral for these responses."
https://openalex.org/W1989224065,"Transcription of the highly pathogenic Ebola virus (EBOV) is dependent on VP30, a constituent of the viral nucleocapsid complex. Here we present evidence that phosphorylation of VP30, which takes place at six N-terminal serine residues and one threonine residue, is of functional significance. Replacement of the phosphoserines by alanines resulted in an only slightly phosphorylated VP30 (VP306A) that is still able to activate EBOV-specific transcription in a plasmid-based minigenome system. VP306A, however, did not bind to inclusions that are induced by the major nucleocapsid protein NP. Three intracellular phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, and PP2C) have been determined to dephosphorylate VP30. The presence of okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, had the same negative effect on transcription activation by VP30 as the substitution of the six phosphoserines for aspartate residues. OA, however, did not impair transcription when VP30 was replaced by VP306A. In EBOV-infected cells, OA blocked virus growth dose-dependently. The block was mediated by the extensive phosphorylation of VP30, which is evidenced by the result that expression of VP306A, in trans, led to the progression of EBOV infection in the presence of OA.

Ebola virus okadaic acid chloramphenicol acetyltransferase post infection Ebola virus (EBOV),1 a filovirus, is notorious for its unpredictable sporadic outbreaks of a fatal hemorrhagic fever in Africa (1WHO Wkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 2001; 76: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2WHO Epidemiol. Bull. 1995; 16: 16PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bowen E.T. Lloyd G. Harris W.J. Platt G.S. Baskerville A. Vella E.E.

To date, neither a vaccine nor a treatment of the EBOV infection is available.The enveloped EBOV particles are composed of seven structural proteins and the negative sense RNA genome. Four viral proteins NP, VP35, L, and VP30 are the constituents of the nucleocapsid. The main component of the nucleocapsid complex is NP, a heavily phosphorylated protein, that encapsidates the genomic RNA and forms intracellular inclusions upon recombinant expression (5Sanchez A. Kiley M.P. Holloway B.P. McCormick J.B. Auperin D.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Pushko P. Bray M. Ludwig G.V. Parker M. Schmaljohn A. Sanchez A.

Virology. 1985; 147: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The NP inclusions are morphologically highly similar to the inclusions formed during EBOV infection of target cells. VP35 and L are the components of the viral polymerase. VP30 represents an EBOV-specific transcription activation factor (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Most viruses of the order Mononegavirales contain three proteins, N (NP), P, and L, that drive the processes of replication (synthesis of genomic RNA) and transcription (synthesis of viral mRNAs). These proteins also constitute the respective viral nucleocapsid complex. N (or NP) represents the major nucleocapsid protein that encapsidates the viral genome. The encapsidated genome serves as a template for the viral polymerase complex, which is constituted by the catalytic subunit L and the cofactor P (9Conzelmann K.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 123-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).A recently established minigenome-based reverse genetic system revealed that EBOV follows another strategy to synthesize the different RNA species. NP, VP35 (the P analogue), and L were sufficient for viral replication, similar to the other Mononegavirales. The fourth nucleocapsid protein VP30, although not influencing replication, dramatically activated the synthesis of the viral mRNAs (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism, i.e. how the phosphoprotein VP30 activates transcription, is still unclear.The phosphorylation state of a cellular or viral protein is determined by the coordinated action of kinases and phosphatases. Although the significance of several cellular kinases for the phosphorylation state of viral proteins of the order Mononegavirales is well established, only a few proteins are described whose function is influenced by phosphorylation (10Yang J. Koprowski H. Dietzschold B. Fu Z.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lenard J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 83: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the impact of cellular phosphatases on the viral replication cycle. However, for papovae- and adenoviruses as well as for the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, the activity of the ubiquitous phosphatase PP2A has been shown to be of functional significance (12Faulkner N.E. Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Garcia A. Cayla X. Sontag E. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In this report, we have determined the phosphorylation sites of VP30 and found that phosphorylation of two N-terminal serine clusters positively regulated binding of VP30 to NP-induced inclusions and negatively regulated the transcription activation function of the protein. We further show that VP30 is a target for cellular protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. In a reconstituted minigenome system, EBOV-specific transcription was blocked by okadaic acid (OA) that is known to inhibit PP1 and PP2A. The effect of OA on the transcription could be attributed to an extensive phosphorylation of VP30. Moreover, the treatment of EBOV-infected cells with OA inhibited EBOV growth, which could be restored by the expression of a nonphosphorylatable VP30 in trans. Taken together, our results show for the first time that VP30 phosphorylation is a regulatory factor in the replication cycle of EBOV that might be a suitable target for the development of antiviral drugs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESViruses and Cell LinesEBOV-Zaire strain Mayinga was grown and passaged as described elsewhere (14Becker S. Feldmann H. Will C. Slenczka W. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 181: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MVA-T7 was grown and titered in chicken embryo fibroblasts (15Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured as described by Mu¨hlberger et al. (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of HeLa cells were used for all experiments with the recombinant vaccinia virus MVA-T7. BSR T7/5 cells (a BHK-21 cell clone), which constitutively expressed T7 RNA polymerase, were cultured as described by Buchholzet al. (16Buchholz U.J. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were grown in six-well plates (7 cm2).Molecular Cloning of VP30 and VP30 MutantsFor expression of VP30 and VP30 mutants the respective genes were cloned into the plasmid pTM1 under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (17Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). VP30 and all VP30 mutants contained a FLAG epitope at the C terminus.Cloning of pT-VP30FFor the construction of a FLAG-tagged VP30, the plasmid pT-VP30EBO was used as template (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the primers #408 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG GAA GCT TCA TAT GAG AGA-3′) and #409 (5′-AGA CTC GAG TTACTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC AGG GGT ACC CTC ATC AGA CCA TGA GCA TG-3′), which contained either a BamHI or anXhoI restriction site (underlined), and the sequence coding for the FLAG epitope (italics), the VP30 gene was amplified by PCR, gel-purified, and cloned into the BamHI site andXhoI sites of the vector pTM1. The final plasmid was verified by sequencing and designated as pT-VP30F.The influence of the FLAG epitope on intracellular localization and on transcription activation of VP30 was checked by immunofluorescence and transcription analysis. This pilot study revealed that neither the intracellular distribution nor the transactivating function of VP30 was altered (data not shown).Cloning of the Mutant pT-VP30Δ68The coding region for amino acids 69–288 of VP30 gene was amplified by PCR using pT-VP30F as template. The forward primer #833 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG CCT AAA GAC ATA TGT CCG-3′) contained aBamHI restriction site (underlined) followed by the nucleotides 8710–8727 of the VP30 gene sequence (the sequence number has been assigned to GenBankTM accession number AF086833). As reverse primer, primer #409 was used. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the plasmid pTM1, and the construct was designated pT-VP30Δ68.Cloning of VP30 Substitution MutantsCloning of the VP30 substitution mutants was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with pT-VP30F as template. All mutants were verified by sequencing.Ebola Virus Transcription AnalysisBSR T7/5 cells (5 × 105 in a 7-cm2well) were transfected with plasmids encoding the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins NP, VP35, VP30, and L, and an EBOV-specific minigenome containing the CAT reporter gene (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the supplier’s prescription. After an incubation period of 8 h, cells were washed two times with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and further incubated for 12–36 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were harvested and CAT activity as a readout for transcription activity was determined. When the impact of OA on transcription was investigated, the drug, diluted in Me2SO, was added 8 h post transfection. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%.CAT AssayCAT activity was determined using a standard protocol (18Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5288) Google Scholar). Quantification of the radioactivity was done with a Fuji BAS-1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fujifilm) by using the TINA software (Raytest).Transfection of EBOV-infected Cells5 × 105 BSR T7/5 cells on glass coverslips in a 7-cm2 dish were infected with EBOV at an multiplicity of infection of ∼1 plaque forming unit per milliliter. At 1 h post infection (p.i.), inoculum was removed and cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of pT-VP30EBO or pT-VP306A as described above. At 3 h p.i., 40 and 80 nm OA, respectively, were added. Cells were fixed at 24 h p.i. with 4% paraformaldehyde, and NP expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-NP antibody and a rhodamine-coupled anti-mouse antibody.VP30 Dephosphorylation by Protein PhosphatasesVP30 was expressed in HeLa cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 system, metabolically labeled with 32Pi and immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) (19Modrof J. Mo¨ritz C. Kolesnikova L. Konakova T. Hartlieb B. Randolf A. Mu¨hlberger E. Becker S. Virology. 2001; 287: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were washed five times in the precipitation buffer without SDS, three times in buffer E (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) and finally resuspended in five volumes buffer E. This suspension was used for incubation with the respective phosphatases. 300 ng of either PP1, PP2A, PP2C, or alkaline phosphatase (AP) were mixed with 1.5 μl of 10× concentrated phosphatase buffer (PP1/PP2A: 500 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol, 50 mmMnCl2; PP2C: 250 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% mercaptoethanol, 100 mm MgCl2; alkaline phosphatase: 500 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm MgCl2), and 10 μl of VP30 suspension. Finally, the total volume was filled up with dH2O to 15 μl, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C.Other MethodsInfection and transfection of HeLa cells, metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate or 35S-Promix, immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence analysis, and formic acid treatment were carried out as described by Modrof et al. (19Modrof J. Mo¨ritz C. Kolesnikova L. Konakova T. Hartlieb B. Randolf A. Mu¨hlberger E. Becker S. Virology. 2001; 287: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have mapped the phosphorylation sites of VP30 to two N-terminal serine clusters and threonine 52. This pattern of phosphorylation is similar to that of Marburg virus VP30 (19Modrof J. Mo¨ritz C. Kolesnikova L. Konakova T. Hartlieb B. Randolf A. Mu¨hlberger E. Becker S. Virology. 2001; 287: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).When functional significance of VP30 phosphorylation was investigated it was found that phosphorylated VP30 was located inside NP inclusions; nonphosphorylated VP30, however, was evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. It is reasonable to presume that the NP inclusions, like their Marburg virus counterparts, consist of NP-induced helical structures representing the core structures of the nucleocapsid (26Kolesnikova L. Mu¨hlberger E. Ryabchikova E. Becker S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3899-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The colocalization of NP and VP30 inside the inclusions is either mediated by a direct interaction between the NP helices and VP30 or by another component, e.g. RNA, as it has been shown recently for M2-1 and N of human respiratory syncytial virus (27Cartee T.L. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12188-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In contrast to the positive effect on the interaction with NP inclusions, phosphorylation of VP30 negatively regulated its transcription activation function. Although nonphosphorylated VP30 activated transcription as the wild-type, a completely phosphorylated VP30 was inactive. These results were supported by the negative effect of the phosphatase inhibitor OA on viral transcription. OA inhibits PP1 and PP2A (23Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar, 28Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) so that both are not able to dephosphorylate VP30. It is presumed that inhibition of the phosphatases leads to an increase of VP30 phosphorylation and consequently to an inactive protein as in the case of the pseudophosphorylated VP306D. This presumption is strongly supported by the result that the effect of OA on EBOV-specific transcription was overcome when VP30 was replaced by the nonphosphorylatable mutant VP306A.Taken together, phosphorylation inversely influenced the two known functions of VP30. A completely phosphorylated form of VP30 was capable of interacting with NP inclusions, but was restricted in mediating viral transcription. In contrast, a phosphorylation-deficient VP30 was inhibited in its interaction with the NP inclusions but supported EBOV-specific transcription. An intermediately phosphorylated VP30 enabled both viral transcription and assembly. Phosphorylation of VP30 is therefore presumed to represent a molecular switch for the different functions of the protein. It is hypothesized that, depending on the respective demands, VP30 enables either viral transcription or assembly or both. Possibly, the non- or weakly phosphorylated VP30 supports transcription until it is removed from the general pool by the phosphorylation-induced binding to the nucleocapsid.The only other viruses in the order Mononegavirales containing a structural protein of similar characteristics as filoviral VP30 belong to the pneumovirinae subfamily of Paramyxoviridae. Here, M2-1 has been shown to be phosphorylated in its N terminus and to interact with the nucleoprotein of human respiratory syncytial virus in intracellular inclusions (29Cuesta I. Geng X. Asenjo A. Villanueva N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9858-9867Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Garcia J. Garcia-Barreno B. Vivo A. Melero J.A.

M2-1 is essential for respiratory syncytial virus transcription elongation and antitermination (32Collins P.L. Hill M.G. Cristina J. Grosfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 33Fearns R. Collins P.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5852-5864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hardy R.W. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 520-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of M2-1 was shown to influence the RNA binding specificity (29Cuesta I. Geng X. Asenjo A. Villanueva N. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9858-9867Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and to be essential for the transcription antitermination activity (27Cartee T.L. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12188-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of M2-1 is of functional significance, but the detected functions differ from that of VP30 phosphorylation.Interestingly, our experiments revealed that OA was able to specifically inhibit the multiplication of EBOV in target cells. Because virus growth was only slightly affected by OA when VP306A was expressed in trans, it is concluded that inhibition was, indeed, caused by an inactive, hence hyperphosphorylated, VP30.It is reasonable to consider whether antiviral drugs could be developed, based on the detected phosphorylation dependence of VP30-mediated EBOV transcription. The severe side effects of OA,i.e. promotion of tumor growth and genetic instability (35Suganuma M. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Yoshizawa S. Hirota M. Nakayasu M. Ojika M. Wakamatsu K. Yamada K. Sugimura T.

Res. 1995; 333: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), prohibit its employment as a drug to block EBOV infection. For future antivirals it is necessary to separate the cytotoxic and the VP30-directed effects of phosphatase inhibition. Because the specificities of most known phosphatases are determined by their subunit composition, i.e. regulatory and scaffolding units (37Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 38Bollen M. Trends Biochem.

Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), it can be expected that the identification and subsequent inhibition of the VP30-specific regulatory subunit(s) of PP1 and PP2A could lead to promising tools for antagonizing EBOV infection.

Four viral proteins NP, VP35, L, and VP30 are the constituents of the nucleocapsid. The main component of the nucleocapsid complex is NP, a heavily phosphorylated protein, that encapsidates the genomic RNA and forms intracellular inclusions upon recombinant expression (5Sanchez A. Kiley M.P. Holloway B.P. McCormick J.B. Auperin D.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Pushko P. Bray M. Ludwig G.V. Parker M. Schmaljohn A. Sanchez A. Jahrling P.B. Smith J.F. Vaccine. 2000; 19: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 7Elliott L.H. Kiley M.P. McCormick J.B. Virology. 1985; 147: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The NP inclusions are morphologically highly similar to the inclusions formed during EBOV infection of target cells. VP35 and L are the components of the viral polymerase. VP30 represents an EBOV-specific transcription activation factor (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most viruses of the order Mononegavirales contain three proteins, N (NP), P, and L, that drive the processes of replication (synthesis of genomic RNA) and transcription (synthesis of viral mRNAs). These proteins also constitute the respective viral nucleocapsid complex. N (or NP) represents the major nucleocapsid protein that encapsidates the viral genome. The encapsidated genome serves as a template for the viral polymerase complex, which is constituted by the catalytic subunit L and the cofactor P (9Conzelmann K.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 123-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A recently established minigenome-based reverse genetic system revealed that EBOV follows another strategy to synthesize the different RNA species. NP, VP35 (the P analogue), and L were sufficient for viral replication, similar to the other Mononegavirales. The fourth nucleocapsid protein VP30, although not influencing replication, dramatically activated the synthesis of the viral mRNAs (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism, i.e. how the phosphoprotein VP30 activates transcription, is still unclear. The phosphorylation state of a cellular or viral protein is determined by the coordinated action of kinases and phosphatases. Although the significance of several cellular kinases for the phosphorylation state of viral proteins of the order Mononegavirales is well established, only a few proteins are described whose function is influenced by phosphorylation (10Yang J. Koprowski H. Dietzschold B. Fu Z.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1661-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lenard J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 83: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the impact of cellular phosphatases on the viral replication cycle. However, for papovae- and adenoviruses as well as for the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, the activity of the ubiquitous phosphatase PP2A has been shown to be of functional significance (12Faulkner N.E. Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Garcia A. Cayla X. Sontag E. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In this report, we have determined the phosphorylation sites of VP30 and found that phosphorylation of two N-terminal serine clusters positively regulated binding of VP30 to NP-induced inclusions and negatively regulated the transcription activation function of the protein. We further show that VP30 is a target for cellular protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. In a reconstituted minigenome system, EBOV-specific transcription was blocked by okadaic acid (OA) that is known to inhibit PP1 and PP2A. The effect of OA on the transcription could be attributed to an extensive phosphorylation of VP30. Moreover, the treatment of EBOV-infected cells with OA inhibited EBOV growth, which could be restored by the expression of a nonphosphorylatable VP30 in trans. Taken together, our results show for the first time that VP30 phosphorylation is a regulatory factor in the replication cycle of EBOV that might be a suitable target for the development of antiviral drugs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESViruses and Cell LinesEBOV-Zaire strain Mayinga was grown and passaged as described elsewhere (14Becker S. Feldmann H. Will C. Slenczka W. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 181: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MVA-T7 was grown and titered in chicken embryo fibroblasts (15Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured as described by Mu¨hlberger et al. (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of HeLa cells were used for all experiments with the recombinant vaccinia virus MVA-T7. BSR T7/5 cells (a BHK-21 cell clone), which constitutively expressed T7 RNA polymerase, were cultured as described by Buchholzet al. (16Buchholz U.J. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were grown in six-well plates (7 cm2).Molecular Cloning of VP30 and VP30 MutantsFor expression of VP30 and VP30 mutants the respective genes were cloned into the plasmid pTM1 under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (17Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). VP30 and all VP30 mutants contained a FLAG epitope at the C terminus.Cloning of pT-VP30FFor the construction of a FLAG-tagged VP30, the plasmid pT-VP30EBO was used as template (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the primers #408 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG GAA GCT TCA TAT GAG AGA-3′) and #409 (5′-AGA CTC GAG TTACTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC AGG GGT ACC CTC ATC AGA CCA TGA GCA TG-3′), which contained either a BamHI or anXhoI restriction site (underlined), and the sequence coding for the FLAG epitope (italics), the VP30 gene was amplified by PCR, gel-purified, and cloned into the BamHI site andXhoI sites of the vector pTM1. The final plasmid was verified by sequencing and designated as pT-VP30F.The influence of the FLAG epitope on intracellular localization and on transcription activation of VP30 was checked by immunofluorescence and transcription analysis. This pilot study revealed that neither the intracellular distribution nor the transactivating function of VP30 was altered (data not shown).Cloning of the Mutant pT-VP30Δ68The coding region for amino acids 69–288 of VP30 gene was amplified by PCR using pT-VP30F as template. The forward primer #833 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG CCT AAA GAC ATA TGT CCG-3′) contained aBamHI restriction site (underlined) followed by the nucleotides 8710–8727 of the VP30 gene sequence (the sequence number has been assigned to GenBankTM accession number AF086833). As reverse primer, primer #409 was used. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the plasmid pTM1, and the construct was designated pT-VP30Δ68.Cloning of VP30 Substitution MutantsCloning of the VP30 substitution mutants was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with pT-VP30F as template. All mutants were verified by sequencing.Ebola Virus Transcription AnalysisBSR T7/5 cells (5 × 105 in a 7-cm2well) were transfected with plasmids encoding the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins NP, VP35, VP30, and L, and an EBOV-specific minigenome containing the CAT reporter gene (8Mu¨hlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the supplier’s prescription. After an incubation period of 8 h, cells were washed two times with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and further incubated for 12–36 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were harvested and CAT activity as a readout for transcription activity was determined. When the impact of OA on transcription was investigated, the drug, diluted in Me2SO, was added 8 h post transfection. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.2%.CAT AssayCAT activity was determined using a standard protocol (18Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2082800491,"The fatty acid transport protein Fat1p functions as a component of the long-chain fatty acid transport apparatus in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fat1p has significant homologies to the mammalian fatty acid transport proteins (FATP) and the very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (VLACS). In order to further understand the functional roles intrinsic to Fat1p (fatty acid transport and VLACS activities), a series of 16 alleles carrying site-directed mutations within FAT1 were constructed and analyzed. Sites chosen for the construction of amino acid substitutions were based on conservation between Fat1p and the mammalian FATP orthologues and included the ATP/AMP and FATP/VLACS signature motifs. Centromeric and 2 mu plasmids encoding mutant forms of Fat1p were transformed into a yeast strain containing a deletion in FAT1 (fat1Delta). For selected subsets of FAT1 mutant alleles, we observed differences between the wild type and mutants in 1) growth rates when fatty acid synthase was inhibited with 45 microm cerulenin in the presence of 100 microm oleate (C(18:1)), 2) levels of fatty acid import monitored using the accumulation of the fluorescent fatty acid 4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid and [(3)H]oleate, 3) levels of lignoceryl (C(24:0)) CoA synthetase activities, and 4) fatty acid profiles monitored using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In most cases, there was a correlation between growth on fatty acid/cerulenin plates, the levels of fatty acid accumulation, very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activities, and the fatty acid profiles in the different FAT1 mutants. For several notable exceptions, the fatty acid transport and very long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase activities were distinguishable. The characterization of these novel mutants provides a platform to more completely understand the role of Fat1p in the linkage between fatty acid import and activation to CoA thioesters."
https://openalex.org/W2064265756,"A growing body of evidence indicates a close relationship between tyrosine kinase receptor trafficking and signaling. Biochemical and molecular analyses of the expression, fate, and kinetics of membrane trafficking of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA were performed in PC12 cells. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that TrkA is synthesized as a 110-kDaN-glycosylated precursor that leads to the mature 140-kDa form of the receptor with a half-life of conversion of ∼24 ± 0.5 min. Neuraminidase digestion shows that modification of the carbohydrate moiety of the receptor by sialylation occurs during maturation. The 140-kDa form is rapidly translocated to the cell surface as assessed by cell surface biotinylation performed on intact PC12 cells. Mature receptor half-life is ∼138 ± 4 min and is shortened to 86 ± 8 min by NGF treatment. Flow cytometric analysis indicates that NGF induces clearing of this receptor from the cell surface within minutes of treatment. The addition of NGF decreases the half-life of cell surface gp140TrkA from 100 to 35 min and leads to enhanced lysosomal degradation of the receptor. The process of NGF-induced TrkA internalization is clearly affected by interfering with ligand binding to p75NTR. An analysis of receptor activation kinetics also shows that receptor signaling primarily takes place from an intracellular location. Together, these data show that the primary effect of NGF treatment is a p75NTR-modulated decrease in TrkA transit time at the cell surface.

Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 2Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Each neurotrophin interacts specifically with a member of the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase family; NGF binds to TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 bind to TrkB, and NT-3 binds to TrkC (1Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 2Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). NT-3 can also activate the other Trk receptors with lower efficacy. Neurotrophins can also associate with the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, which lacks intrinsic catalytic activity. NGF is necessary for differentiation and survival of certain sensory and sympathetic neurons (3Patel T.D. Jackman A. Rice F.L. Kucera J. Snider W.D. Frade J.M. Barde Y.A.

Res. 1994; 38: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This cell line has been extensively studied as a model for NGF-induced signal transduction events because it can mimic NGF-induced survival or differentiation observed in neuronal cells (6Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Binding of NGF to TrkA induces autophosphorylation of the receptor on specific tyrosine residues (7Friedman W.J. Greene L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 8Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). This initiates a cascade of events leading to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) (9Soltoff S.P. Rabin S.L. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17472-17477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Vetter M.L. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Bishop J.M. Kaplan D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1992; 68: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Signaling events mediated by TrkA appear to be mediated by trafficking of the receptor. It has been shown, for example, that NGF treatment results in the accumulation of PC12 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (12Rudkin B.B. Lazarovici P. Levi B.-Z. Abe Y. Fujita K. Guroff G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3319-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13van Grunsven L.A. Thomas A. Urdiales J.L. Machenaud S. Choler P. Durand I. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 855-862PubMed Google Scholar). During early G1, there is an apparent enhanced expression of the TrkA receptor at the PC12 cell surface (14Urdiales J.L. Becker E. Andrieu M. Thomas A. Jullien J. van Grunsven L.A. Menut S. Evan G.I. Martin-Zanca D. Rudkin B.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6767-6775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, upon NGF binding TrkA has been reported (15Huang C.S. Zhou J. Feng A.K. Lynch C.C. Klumperman J. DeArmond S.J. Mobley W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36707-36714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to exit from raft fractions where it is initially located. It has also been shown that, following ligand binding, TrkA undergoes a dynamin-dependent internalization probably viathe coated pit pathway (16Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang Y. Moheban D.B. Conway B.R. Bhattacharyya A. Segal R.A. Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5671-5678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interfering with this process inhibits neurotrophic activity of the growth factor (17Zhang Y.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8069-8083Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, molecular processes regulating both TrkA targeting to the cell surface and internalization from this location may play a role in modulating signaling via this receptor. In mature neurons, additional spatial constraints come into play because NGF is restricted to the synaptic area located far from the cell body where the growth factor is believed to exert its effect (19Reynolds A.J. Bartlett S.E. Hendry I.A. Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Numerous studies support the idea that signaling from the growth cone to the cell body is mediated by signaling vesicles containing the activated NGF-TrkA complex (16Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Grimes M.L. Beattie E. Mobley W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Maturation events offer further means for the potential regulation of signaling by NGF. Two protein forms of TrkA predominate in the cell extracts, a 110 kDa N-glycosylated form called gp110TrkA and a 140-kDa fully matured form, gp140TrkA (23Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). gp110TrkA is proposed to be the precursor for the mature gp140TrkA. It has been shown that levels of gp110TrkA and gp140TrkA are not affected in the same manner by NGF treatment (24Zhou J. Valletta J.S. Grimes M.L. Mobley W.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, maturation of the receptor appears to depend on the cellular background in which TrkA is expressed. Indeed, depending on the cellular model used for the study of receptor maturation, the receptor form activated by NGF can be gp110TrkA or gp140TrkA(25Ross A.H. Daou M.C. McKinnon C.A. Condon P.J.

Ross A.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3178-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). From synthesis to degradation, transmembrane proteins are directed to several different locations within the cell. Along the biosynthetic pathway they are inserted into the membrane bilayer at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum where some co-translational modifications may occur (27Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Further maturation of the proteins occurs in the Golgi network where additional modifications of the lumenal domain are believed to take place (28Hanisch F.G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). After this step, proteins may be directly translocated to the cell surface or to intracellular membrane compartments (29Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, transmembrane proteins may enter the endocytic pathway, which brings them inside the cell within endosomes (30Rohn W.M. Rouille Y. Waguri S. Hoflack B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2093-2101PubMed Google Scholar). From this location, proteins can return to the cell surface (recycling) or be targeted to the lysosome (degradation). In certain cases, extra-lysosomal proteolytic cleavage of the cytoplasmic portion of a receptor can occur, releasing a fragment that can go into other compartments such as the nucleus (31Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). TrkA trafficking along both biosynthetic and endocytic pathways has been studied. Results presented herein offer an approximation of the kinetic parameters for the translocation of TrkA to and from the cell surface and the effect of NGF thereon. This was achieved by a complementary approach of cell surface biotinylation and flow cytometric analysis of cell surface receptor expression. These experiments allow us not only to measure the kinetics of receptor maturation and turnover but also to analyze how these kinetics correlate with variations in, and the activation state of, the total TrkA cellular pools found within different cellular compartments. The ability of NGF to modify receptor internalization from the cell surface has also been tested. Finally, the contribution of p75NTRto NGF-induced TrkA internalization has been evaluated. Sulfo-NHS-biotin and streptavidin-agarose were purchased from Pierce. Anti-TrkA extracellular domain (RTA) and anti-p75NTR extracellular domain (REX) antibodies were prepared as previously described (32Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol.

Anti-p75 carboxyl-terminal sera was a kind gift of Dr. Moses V. Chao (New York University Medical Center). Anti-Trk (C-14), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY99), and anti-phospho 490 Trk (E6) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 3NGF, a generous gift of Dr. C. Ibanez, was produced as described previously (33Ibanez C.F. Ebendal T. Barbany G. Murray-Rust J. Blundell T.L. Persson H.

Protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) were fromAmersham Biosciences. R-phycoerythrin-conjugated Affinipure F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Neuraminidase and the anti-p75NTRextracellular domain monoclonal antibody MC192 were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Chloroquin, ammonium chloride, tunicamycin, and concanavalin A were from Sigma. In pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated for 2 h in methionine- and cysteine-free media. Cells (3–4 million/time point) were then exposed to 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and cysteine for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with complete medium and chased for different periods of time. In some experiments, cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μg/ml tunicamycin before and during pulse-chase experiments. At the end of the chase period, cell surface biotinylation was performed. Intact cells were incubated for 45 min in ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-biotin. Cells were then washed four times in PBS with 2 mm lysine to remove unbound reactive biotin. After metabolic labeling and cell surface biotinylation, proteins were extracted using ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 6 mm sodium fluoride). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Cleared lysates were then immunoprecipitated using the Trk C-14 antibody directed against the human TrkA carboxyl terminus. Immunocomplexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose beads and eluted by boiling for 10 min in 10% SDS. The resulting immunoprecipitated protein was divided in two parts. One part was kept as the “total TrkA” sample and the second part was subjected to a second precipitation step with streptavidin-agarose beads to obtain the “surface TrkA” fraction. Proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for quantification with a Storm PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Proteins were labeled and immunoprecipitated as described in the previous paragraph. Immunocomplexes were resuspended in acetate buffer (20 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5 mm CaCl2). Digestion was then performed for 3 h at 37 °C with 0.75 milliunits/ml neuraminidase. The digested proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Cells were collected in warm PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in culture medium and subjected to NGF treatment (concentration ranging from 0 to 50 ng/ml) at 37 °C on a rotating wheel. In some experiments, cells were also treated with 8 μg/ml MC192 antibody. Cells were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS and used as live intact cells for immunolabeling. All the subsequent labeling steps were performed on ice. Cells were washed twice in blocking buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.02% sodium azide) and incubated for 30 min in the same buffer containing an antibody directed against the RTA. After two washes in blocking buffer, cells were exposed for 30 min to phycoerythrin-labeled secondary antibody and washed again three times. Cells were then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Immunocytometry Systems) equipped with an argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm. Emission fluorescence was measured with a DF 585–42 filter. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with CellQuest software (BD PharMingen). PC12 cells (obtained from Dr. G. Guroff, National Institutes of Health) and PC12 6-24 overexpressing human neuronal TrkA (provided by Dr. D. Martin-Zanca, Instituto de Microbiologia Bioquemica, Universida de Salamanca, Spain) were grown as described previously (34van Grunsven L.A. Billon N. Savatier P. Thomas A. Urdiales J.L. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1347-1356PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were transfected with rat TrkA-EGFP vector using the calcium phosphate procedure. 24 h post-transfection, cells were spread on collagen poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips (14Urdiales J.L. Becker E. Andrieu M. Thomas A. Jullien J. van Grunsven L.A. Menut S. Evan G.I. Martin-Zanca D. Rudkin B.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6767-6775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS with 3.7% formaldehyde. Labeling of cell surface TrkA was then carried out by incubation with RTA serum (1:2000) followed by incubation with a rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were then permeabilized for 1 min in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with anti-phospho TrkA mouse monoclonal antibody (E6; 1:200) or anti-transferrin receptor mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated an additional 30 min with Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After washing, cells were mounted in Moviol. Images were acquired using the MRC1000 confocal laser unit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) coupled to a Zeiss Axioplan Microscope equipped with a Zeiss 40×, C-apo, 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Mechanisms by which TrkA is transported to the plasma membrane were investigated. Analyses of the synthesis and cell surface targeting of this receptor were performed by metabolic labeling. Although detectable, the levels of endogenous TrkA expression in PC12 cells were too low to allow proper monitoring of changes in turnover using metabolic labeling. The PC12 6-24 line stably expressing higher levels of TrkA was therefore used for this type of analysis and certain others in the course of these studies. Preliminary experiments indicated that the synthesis and maturation of endogenous and exogenous TrkA were similar for those parameters where comparison was possible (apparent molecular weight of the different forms, sensitivity to neuraminidase, surface targeting, surface to lysosome trafficking) (data not shown). Pulse-chase experiments presented in Fig. 1 A indicate that TrkA is synthesized as a 110-kDa glycoprotein, which is processed to the 140-kDa mature form with a half-life of 24 ± 0.5 min. Tunicamycin treatment suggests that gp110TrkA has a sugar component that modifies the overall apparent molecular weight by approximately 30 kDa, because the inhibition ofN-glycosylation by this drug leads to the appearance of the 80-kDa form of the receptor (Fig.2 A). Moreover, the inhibition of N-glycosylation abolished receptor maturation as shown by the absence of the higher molecular weight form of the receptor after 2 h of chase in the presence of tunicamycin. This lack of receptor processing correlates with the inability of the unglycosylated receptor to reach the cell surface (Fig. 2 A, right panel). Experiments presented in Fig. 2 B(top panel) indicate that gp140TrkA is the only form of TrkA that is sensitive to neuraminidase digestion. It would appear therefore, that the final step of maturation requires sialylation of the sugar moiety of the receptor. Moreover, the precursor and mature forms of TrkA are differentially precipitated with concanavalin A and WGA lectin as are those for p75NTR (Fig. 2 B, bottom). These data argue again in favor of the modification of glycosylation during the processing of TrkA from the precursor to the mature form. WGA has greater affinity for glycosyl groups enriched inN-acetyl-glucosamine residues (35Arenas M.I. Royuela M. Fraile B. Paniagua R. Wilhelm B. Aumuller G. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 79-87PubMed Google Scholar). These latter residues are transferred to glycoprotein in the Golgi (27Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Preferential precipitation of gp140TrkA by this lectin suggests that the later steps of TrkA maturation occur at the level of the Golgi network.Figure 2Maturation of TrkA. The lower panels of A and B are autoradiograms obtained from pulse-chase experiments in PC12 6-24 cells (see “Materials and methods” for details). A, the experiment has been performed either in the presence or in the absence of 1 μg/ml of the N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin.B, the lower panel is an autoradiogram of TrkA proteins that have been subjected to neuraminidase digestion after immunoprecipitation. The upper panelpresents the results of Western blot analysis performed on extracts precipitated with the lectins concanavalin A (ConA) or WGA. Membranes were probed with the RTA antibody directed against the TrkA extracellular domain or with the anti-p75NTRcarboxyl-terminal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell surface protein biotinylation allows the monitoring of the cell surface appearance of the receptor during the time course of pulse-chase experiments. The mature gp140TrkA form of the receptor is detectable both in the total cell extract and at the cell surface after a 10 min chase (Fig. 1, A and B). These kinetics suggest that, as soon as it is mature, TrkA is translocated to the cell surface. The half-life of the mature receptor is 138 ± 4 min (Fig. 1 C). Cell surface biotinylation allows calculation of the half-life of gp140TrkAat the cell surface as being 100 ± 12 min, which is ∼70% of the half-life of total gp140TrkA. Pulse-chase experiments followed by the quantification of total or cell surface TrkA show a differential impact of NGF treatment on the steps of TrkA processing and trafficking analyzed previously. Fig. 1 C shows that the presence of 50 ng/ml of NGF induces only a slight decrease in the half-life of gp110TrkA from 24 to 20 ± 0.5 min. By contrast, the half-life of total gp140TrkA appears to be decreased by 40% in the presence of the growth factor (from 138 ± 4 to 86 ± 8 min). Moreover, there is a 65% reduction in the cell surface receptor half-life (from 100 ± 12 to 35 ± 1 min) following NGF treatment. These data indicate that receptor maturation is not affected by NGF, whereas the duration of gp140TrkA on the cell surface and the time needed for targeting of this protein to its sites of degradation are significantly decreased in the presence of NGF. In PC12 cells, Western blot analyses of total cellular TrkA protein indicate that the ratio of gp140TrkA to gp110TrkA is decreased during NGF treatment (Fig.3 A). This is the result of a decrease in the cellular content of gp140TrkA, which is detectable within 30 min of incubation with NGF. Less than 10% of the initial level of this protein is detected after 5 h of growth factor treatment, whereas cellular pools of gp110TrkA and p75NTR are not affected (as ascertained from quantitation derived from Western blot data). Biotinylation experiments indicate that gp140TrkA is cleared from the cell surface within 5 min of NGF treatment, whereas the cell surface level of p75NTR remains constant (Fig. 3 B). The presence of NGF does not appear to result in a decrease in TrkA synthesis, because total cellular gp110TrkA is not altered by growth factor treatment (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, receptor maturation is not affected by NGF treatment as assessed by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1 A). The gp140TrkAdown-regulation observed in Fig. 3 A is therefore most likely the result of enhanced receptor degradation rather than a decrease in the production of this protein. NGF-induced down-regulation of total gp140TrkA has been analyzed in the presence of two inhibitors of lysosomal enzymes. Data presented in Fig.4 show that the two drugs tested lead to a decrease in receptor degradation with NH4Cl being the most efficient inhibitor. Treatment with NH4Cl also inhibits EGF-induced degradation of the EGF receptor. These results suggest that NGF-induced degradation of gp140TrkA occurs in lysosomes. A modified cell surface biotinylation experiment allows the monitoring of the time course of gp140TrkA targeting to the lysosome. In the experiment depicted in Fig.5, cell surface biotinylation was performed prior to NGF treatment. The fates of biotinylated proteins were then followed upon additional incubation with or without NGF. An analysis of biotinylated protein shows that the cell surface gp140TrkA pool labeled at the beginning of the experiment begins to be degraded in the lysosome within 1 h of culture. The cell surface gp140TrkApool half-life can be estimated from this type of experiment, indicating that the speed of receptor movement from the cell surface to the lysosome is increased 2–3-fold by the presence of NGF. To monitor the cell surface levels of a receptor more easily, flow cytometric analysis was used to detect cell surface TrkA. This approach offers sensitivity comparable with that of cell surface biotinylation to detect TrkA clearing from the plasma membrane (data not shown). Using both of these techniques, we have analyzed NGF-induced TrkA internalization under conditions wherein NGF binding to p75NTR has been altered. Modification of NGF binding to p75NTR was first obtained by incubating PC12 cells in the presence of the MC192 monoclonal antibody that is specific for the extracellular domain of p75NTR. This antibody increases the affinity of p75NTR for NGF by ∼2.5-fold (36Barker P.A. Shooter E.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 203-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). gp140TrkA internalization was evaluated by flow cytometry using concentrations of 1–50 ng/ml NGF. Fig. 6 A shows that the use of this anti-p75NTR antibody almost completely abolishes NGF-induced TrkA internalization. The REX anti-p75NTR antibody inhibits binding of NGF through direct competition (32Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Mischel P.S. Smith S.G. Vining E.R. Valletta J.S. Mobley W.C. Reichardt L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11294-11301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the presence of REX, the internalization of TrkA, which is monitored by biotinylation of the cell surface receptor, is inhibited at 5 ng/ml NGF, whereas it is unaffected at 50 ng/ml (Fig. 6 B). Use of 3NGF, a mutated form of NGF with a reduced affinity for p75NTR, extends the observations made with the two antibodies. Results depicted in Fig. 7using flow cytometric analysis show that a small decrease in the internalization efficiency was detectable when low levels of mutant3NGF were used as compared with wild type growth factor (1 or 5 ng/ml). By contrast, at 50 ng/ml there was no significant difference between the wild type and the mutant neurotrophin. Comparable results were observed using biotinylation of the cell surface receptor (results not shown). A large increase in total phosphorylated TrkA was detected viaWestern blot within 15 min of NGF treatment (Fig.8 A, gels at top). The subsequent decrease in phosphorylation of TrkA followed the decrease of total TrkA resulting from prolonged exposure to growth factor, as described above. By contrast, NGF treatment led only to a slight increase in cell surface phosphorylated TrkA as compared with the total phospho-TrkA in the cell (Fig. 8 A). Cell surface phosphorylated TrkA appeared to be maintained at a constant low level from 15 to 300 min after NGF treatment. Such a disparity between the cell surface and the total phosphorylated receptor suggests that the bulk of the activated receptor is localized intracellularly. The precise intracellular localization of the activated receptor was monitored using confocal microscopy (Fig. 8 B).

https://openalex.org/W2053633604,"A carotenoid binding protein (CBP) has been isolated from the silk glands of Bombyx mori larvae. The protein has an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa and binds carotenoids in a 1:1 molar ratio. Lutein accounts for 90% of the bound carotenoids, whereas α-carotene and β-carotene are minor components. Immunological analysis demonstrated the presence of CBP only in the yellow-colored tissues of the silk gland, midgut, testis, and ovary. Several phenotypes of B. mori mutants linked to carotenoid transport have been utilized to characterize CBP. TheY (yellow hemolymph) gene controls uptake of carotenoids from the midgut lumen into the midgut epithelium, and larvae with the +Y gene lack this property. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the presence of CBP in mutants with the dominant Y gene only. Immunohistochemistry verified the localization of CBP in the villi of the midgut epithelium, indicating that CBP might be involved in absorption of carotenoids. A cDNA clone for CBP encoding a protein of 297 amino acids has been isolated from the B. mori silk gland cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that CBP is a novel member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein family with its unique structural feature of a StAR-related lipid transfer domain, known to aid in lipid transfer and recognition. Lutein-binding capacity of the recombinant CBP (rCBP) determined by incubating rCBP with lutein followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-CBP IgG conjugated to protein A-Sepharose, demonstrated the formation of a lutein-rCBP complex.

For example, a deficiency of carotenoids in Drosophila melanogaster causes a decrease in visual sensitivity (1Stark W.S. Zitzmann W.G. J. Comp. Physiol. 1976; 105: 15-27Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phototactic responses are lost when the silkworm Bombyx morilarvae are reared on a carotenoid-free diet (2Shimizu I. Kitabatake S. Kato M. J. Insect Physiol. 1981; 27: 593-599Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The green color, a product of yellow and blue bile pigments, serves a camouflage role in insects (3Needham H. Rockstein M. Biochemistry of Insect. Academic Press, New York1978: 233-271Google Scholar). The production of a yellow cocoon in B. mori is dependent on the availability of carotenoids in the silk gland site of silk production. How dietary carotenoids are transferred from the midgut to the silk gland via the hemolymph is unclear. The existence of cellular carrier proteins that facilitate this transfer process has been predicted for many years (4Nakajima M. Bull. Fac. Agric. Tokyo Univ. Agric. Technol. 1963; 8: 1-80Google Scholar). A lutein binding protein (LBP)1 was purified fromB. mori midgut (5Jouni Z.E. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LBP is a 35-kDa, water-soluble protein found in the midgut, testis, and fat body. However, the role of this protein in lutein transfer and its sequence has not been reported. In mammalian systems many carotenoid-specific binding proteins have been identified (6Ong D.E. Crow J.A.

Three cytosolic retinol binding proteins, type I, II, and III, and two cytosolic retinoic acid binding proteins have been described (8Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Retinoid binding proteins belong to the lipocalin family, the members of which share a very low sequence identity. The ligand-binding sites of these lipocalins differ in their structural details providing distinct ligand selectivity (9Noy N. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 481-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In insects, transport of absorbed carotenoids by hemolymph lipoprotein, lipophorin, has been documented by many investigators (10Chino H. Kerkut G.A. Gilbert L.I. Comprehensive Insect Physiology, Biochemistry, and Parmacology. 10. Pergamon Press, Oxford1985: 115-134Google Scholar, 11Tsuchida K. Arai M. Tanaka Y. Ishihara R. Ryan R. Maekawa H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lipophorin serves as a reusable shuttle, which moves lipids from one tissue to another without itself entering the site (12Chino H. Kitazawa K. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 1042-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. Insect Biochem. 1988; 18: 263-268Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfer of carotenoids from midgut to lipophorin or from lipophorin to silk gland occurs at the interface between cell plasma membrane and hemolymph. Lipophorin selectively deposits certain lipids at specific tissues. For example, during the larval stage lipophorin delivers diacylglycerol mainly to fat body, hydrocarbon to integument, and carotenoids to silk gland and reproductive tissues. The observed selectivity is not fully understood or characterized, although some of the proteins such as lipid transfer particle (14Tsuchida K. Soulages J.L. Moribayashi A. Suzuki K. Maekawa H. Wells M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1337: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the lipophorin receptor (15Tsuchida K. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involved in lipid mobilization have been identified. It is conceivable that other cell surface components are present to facilitate the selective lipid delivery. Genetic linkage mapping has identified three genes whose products control the uptake and transport of carotenoids in B. mori, and mutants of these genes are currently available (16Doira H. Tajima Y. The Silkworm, An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha, Tokyo1978: 53-81Google Scholar) as follows: (i) The Y gene (yellow hemolymph) controls uptake of carotenoids from the midgut lumen into midgut epithelium, thus, larvae of mutants with the+Y/+Y phenotype cannot absorb carotenoids from the midgut. (ii) The I gene (yellow inhibitor, suppresses Y gene products) controls transfer of carotenoids from midgut epithelium into the hemolymph associated with lipophorin. (iii) The C gene (golden yellow cocoon) controls the uptake of carotenoids from hemolymph to the middle parts of the silk gland. Only larvae with the phenotype Y +IC make yellow cocoons. All other gene combinations make white cocoons. Analyses of these mutants offer great promise for dissecting the pathway of carotenoids transport. In the present study, we utilized the Y +IC (N4) strain to purify a carotenoid binding protein (CBP) involved in the uptake of carotenoids into the midgut epithelium and silk gland. This protein is a new member of the StAR family that is able to specifically bind carotenoid. Protease inhibitor mixture III and protease inhibitor mixture complete were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany). DEAE-Trisacryl M was obtained from Biosepra (France) and Sephadex G-75, PBE 96, Polybuffer, His-Trap purification kit, λExcell EcoRI/CIP, and Escherichia coli strain NP66 were obtained from AmershamBiosciences. pGX-4T-3 expression vector was purchased from Molecular Biologische Technologie (Germany), and hydroxyapatite, polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat serum and immunodetection kits were purchased from Bio-Rad (Cambridge, MA). A cDNA-synthesized kit, DNA ligation kit, and 5′-Full RACE core set were purchased from Takara (Japan). A Gigapack III Gold Packaging kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). A MACS mRNA isolation kit, a Plasmid Midi kit, and a TA cloning vector kit were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA), Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA), and Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), respectively. B. mori of the N4 strain were reared on an artificial diet (made from mulberry leaves, Yakult, Japan) at 25 °C on a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. We used four mutant strains of B. mori with the following four genotypes:YI, Y+I, +YI, and +Y+I. The Ystrains can transfer carotenoids from midgut lumen to midgut epithelium, whereas the +Y strains cannot. TheI strain cannot transfer carotenoids from the midgut epithelium to lipophorin, whereas the +I strain can. All mutants were reared on fresh mulberry leaves. During the development of the purification scheme, CBP was followed by its yellow color. Purification was monitored spectrophotometrically using the ratio of the carotenoid absorbance at 452 nm to protein absorbance at 280 nm. The silk glands from day 5 fifth instar B. mori larvae (N4 strain;Y+IC) were dissected out and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 1 mm benzamidine. The silk glands (260.3 g) were homogenized with 1300 ml of PBS and 1 ml of a protease inhibitor mixture III in a Polytron homogenizer for 30 s and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 45% saturation in ammonium sulfate, equilibrated for 1 h, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 × g. Using the same procedure, the supernatant was adjusted to 75% saturation in ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was dissolved in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, dialyzed, and applied to a DEAE-Trisacryl M column equilibrated in the same buffer. Different fractions were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–200 mm) at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The flow-through fraction, containing the yellow protein, was applied to a Sephadex G-75 (2.5 × 110 cm) column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm benzamidine and was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions containing the yellow protein were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mmTris-CH3COOH buffer (pH 8.5) applied to a PBE96 chromatofocusing column and eluted with pH 5 Polybuffer at a flow rate of 36 ml/h following the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing the yellow protein were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate buffer, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.0, and applied to a hydroxyapatite column. The yellow protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm) at a flow rate of 22 ml/h. The purity of the CBP was confirmed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE analysis. Purified CBP was loaded on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band was cut and incubated with lysyl endopeptidase (17Hellmann U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Amino acids were sequenced from three peptides using an HP G1005A protein sequencing system. Protein concentration was determined by either the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) or Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. All solvents were flushed with N2 gas. Purified CBP (60 μl containing 24.6 μg of protein) was added to 1 ml of ethanol containing 0.5 ml of distilled water and vortexed for 30 s. Six milliliters of then-hexane was added to the mixture followed by vortexing for 5min. The organic phase was removed and purged with N2 gas, and anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to remove water. Five milliliters of the organic phase was dried in a rotary evaporator, resolubilized in 0.2 ml of ethanol, and used for carotenoids analyses and quantification using HPLC. Extracted carotenoids were injected onto an Intersil ODS 3.5-μm column (4.6 × 150 mm) equilibrated with acetonitrile:methanol:tetrahydrofuran (58:38:7, v/v), with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eluted components were detected by a Shimadzu SPD-10AV detector and compared with a mixture of carotenoid standards: α-carotene, β-carotene, and lutein. Antibody for immunoblotting was raised in Japanese White rabbits by subcutaneous injection of the CBP and adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A + trehalose dimycolate + cell wall skeleton emulsion (Corixa Corp., Hamilton, MT)) mixture. The serum was stored at −80 °C. To identify the presence of CBP in different tissues and mutants, protein samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters using the method of Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin J. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted using rabbit anti-CBP antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. The filters were developed using a color-developing kit. Tissue distribution of CBP was determined on the following samples: the midgut, silk gland, hemolymph, fat body, malpighian tubules, integument, testis, muscle, and ovary from day 4 of 5th instar larvae. Distribution of the CBP in the anterior, middle, and posterior portion on the silk gland and the midgut were also determined. All tissues were weighed and homogenized in 5 volumes of PBS using a Polytron homogenizer and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Samples of the supernatant (25 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-CBP antibody following the procedure described above. Presence or absence of CBP in the midguts and silk glands from four strains with the following phenotypes of YI, Y+I, +YI, and +Y+I were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-CBP antibody. A directional cDNA library was constructed by utilizing 2 μg of mRNA obtained from the silk gland of days 3–5 of 5th instar larvae for cDNA synthesis. The cDNA was ligated into λExCellEcoRI/CIP and packaged using the Gigapack III Gold packaging kit. The phage were plated onto NZYM plates with E. colistrain NM522 as the host and then transferred to nitrocellulose filters pretreated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG). The filters were probed with rabbit anti-CBP antibody, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat serum, and an alkaline phosphatase color development system. Bacteriophage containing CBP clones were used to infect E. coli strain NP66, which enables in vitro release of pExCell, autonomously replicating phagemid. The pExCell DNA was purified using a Plasmid Midi kit. The obtained positive clone was sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination procedure using a Time Saver sequencing kit using Sp6 and T7 universal primers. DNA sequencing was performed on an automated sequencer. The 5′-terminal cDNA ends was amplified using the 5′-Full RACE Core Set according to the supplier's instructions. The antisense strand synthesis was directed with 0.5 μg of mRNA and primed with 5′-(P)GATCCTGCTCAGCCT-3′. PCR was conducted using first forward primer, 5′-CGAATTGATAAACGTGGGACA-3′; first reverse primer, 5′-CGCTTTTCGACGTAGA GTCG-3′; and second forward primer, 5′-ATGAGTACGAGAATAGGCTG-3′; and second reverse primer, 5′-CGGCGGTTTCCTCGTTGATT-3′. The PCR product was cloned into a TA cloning vector kit for sequencing. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence was performed using the Swiss-Prot homology search in the data base BLAST worldwide web site (blastgnome.ad.jp). The sequences were aligned using the GCG pileup program (Wisconsin Package, version 9.0, Genome Computer Group, Inc) with ClustalW, version 1.7 (20Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). This sequence has been deposited in the DDBJ under accession number AF309498. The coding region for the putative mature protein was amplified by PCR (forward prime containing a sequence encoding ten histidines, 5′-CGCGGATCCCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACATGGCCGACTCTACGTCGAAAAGCG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGATTTCGGCTCTGGCCTTCGCT-3′). The amplified region was cloned in the pGX-4T-3 expression vector. The presence of the recombinant cDNA was verified by colony direct PCR. The transformant was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth, and the fusion protein production was induced by the addition of IPTG (1 mm). The bacteria cells were grown for overnight at 30 °C, then harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication. The recombinant CBP (rCBP) expressed in E. coli strain BL21 was purified with the His-Trap purification kit. Purified rCBP was resuspended in binding buffer (PBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA), and its concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Carotenoid binding experiments were conducted following a modified method of Vogelet al. (8Vogel S. Mendelsohn C.L. Mertz J.R. Piantedosi R. Waldburger C. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1353-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Samples containing 25 μm rCBP and 50 μm lutein (dissolved in ethanol) were incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer for 3 h at 25 °C. Control experiments were performed using the same procedure in the absence of purified rCBP or the presence of BSA. Anti-CBP rabbit IgG-protein A-Sepharose was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose-rCBP-lutein complex was collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 s. To remove the unbound lutein, the pellets were washed three times with 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mg/ml BSA. Binding of lutein to rCBP was confirmed by the presence of the yellow colored precipitate. Histochemical staining was used to determine the localization of CBP. Midgut from day 4 of 5th instar larva was dissected in PBS, washed in the same buffer, and cut into small pieces. A drop of Tissue-tek was added to the pieces prior to freezing in n-hexane with acetone/dry ice mixture at −70 °C. The frozen samples were cut to sections of 4-μm thickness using Cryostat. The cryostat sections were fixed in acetone at −10 °C for 10 min, air-dried, washed in PBS, and incubated with normal rabbit serum diluted 1:10 in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml BSA for 10 min at 37 °C. The sections were further incubated with anti-CBP rabbit antibody (diluted 1:500 in PBS) for 30 min and then washed three times in PBS. Fixed and mounted sections of the midgut were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG goat serum coupled to peroxidase (diluted 1:500) for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, and developed for 10 min at room temperature using a substrate solution (0.005% H2O2, 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 mNaCl) and then counterstained in Mayer's hematoxylin. Images were photographed. Cocoons of B. mori are found with a wide range of colors, yellow, orange, and red, all of which are linked to absorbed carotenoids (16Doira H. Tajima Y. The Silkworm, An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha, Tokyo1978: 53-81Google Scholar). In white cocoon mutants, the normal yellow carotenoid pigment is absent due to abnormal carotenoid transport (4Nakajima M. Bull. Fac. Agric. Tokyo Univ. Agric. Technol. 1963; 8: 1-80Google Scholar). The Y gene controls absorption of carotenoids from the midgut lumen into the midgut epithelium, and mutants with the recessive +Y gene cannot take up carotenoids, thus their cocoon is white. We purified a carotenoid binding protein from the silk gland of N4 B. mori larvae using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-, Sephadex G-75-, chromatofocusing, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. CBP was followed by its yellow color and monitored by the absorbance at 452 nm (Table I). Three yellow fractions were obtained after DEAE ion exchange chromatography. The flow-through fraction of the DEAE column, with the highest carotenoid-to-protein ratio along with a characteristic β-carotene spectrum, was used in the subsequent purification steps. The purified CBP has a molecular mass of 33,000 Da on SDS-PAGE. The yield of CBP was 0.53 mg from about 2500 pairs of silk gland (wet weight, 260.3 g). Absorption spectrum of CBP is characterized by three absorbance maxima in the visible region at 436, 461, and 493 nm, apart from a protein peak at 280 nm. This spectrum is not unique to CBP, other invertebrate carotenoproteins, depending on the color of the chromophore, exhibit absorption maxima between 370 to 680 nm (5Jouni Z.E. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The absorbance maxima of the CBP represent a significant red shift of 22 nm compared with lutein spectrum in hexane. It is interesting to mention that CBP exhibits identical absorption spectra to LBP isolated from the midgut of B. mori (5Jouni Z.E. Wells M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14722-14726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Table ISummary of the purification of the carotenoids bindin protein from B. mori larval silk glandStepProteinA452/A280Purificationmg-foldSupernatant from silk gland homogenate1736.80.0056145–75% ammonium sulfate fraction663.80.00801.4DEAE fraction172.40.01132.0Sephadex G-75 fraction18.90.151527.1Chromatofocusing fraction3.40.6374113.8Hydroxyapatite fraction0.51.0769192.3 Open table in a new tab To analyze the CBP-associated yellow chromophore, the carotenoids were extracted from the purified CBP, analyzed, and quantified by HPLC (Table II). The bound chromophore, identified as lutein (88%), β-carotene (9%), and α-carotene (3%) is consistent with the carotenoids composition of lipophorin and the artificial diet contained mulberry leaves (11Tsuchida K. Arai M. Tanaka Y. Ishihara R. Ryan R. Maekawa H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, dietary carotenoids are absorbed and transferred from the midgut lumen to the silk gland via lipophorin without any metabolic modifications. The 1:1 molar ratio of carotenoids to protein is in accordance with that reported for the vertebrate cellular β-carotene binding protein (7Rao M.N. Ghosh P. Lakshman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24455-24460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and not that of LBP (5Jouni Z.E. Wells M.A. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that CBP is found in the silk gland, midgut, testis, and ovary and not in the hemolymph, fat body, malpighian tubules, muscle, and integument (Fig. 1). The presence of CBP in the carotenoid-containing yellow tissues emphasizes the tissue specificity of CBP. Distribution analyses of CBP within the silk gland and midgut indicated the presence of CBP only in the middle part of the silk gland (Fig. 2A, panel II). Furthermore, the middle part of the midgut exhibited the highest distribution of CBP with minor amounts in the anterior and posterior (Fig. 2B, panel IV). These results show that carotenoids might absorb from the middle part of midgut. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that carotenoids are only incorporated from lipophorin into those cells that contain a specific cytoplasmic binding protein such as CBP (21Canavoso L.E. Jouni Z.E. Karnas K.J. Pennington Wells M.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 23-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar).FIG. 2Distribution of CBP in different sections of the silk gland and the midgut. Protein samples were prepared from the anterior, middle, and posterior sections of the silk gland (A) and midgut (B). Samples (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Panels I and III were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Panels II and IV were Western analyses against anti-CBP antibody (refer to methodology for further details).Lane M represents molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The product of theC gene (present in the N4 strain) has been proposed to regulate carotenoid uptake from hemolymph into the middle silk gland (16Doira H. Tajima Y. The Silkworm, An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha, Tokyo1978: 53-81Google Scholar). To determine whether CBP is the product of the C gene, protein samples from midguts and silk glands of the wild type (C) and the mutant (+C) larvae were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-CBP antibody (Fig.3). CBP was found in the midgut and silk gland of both the C and +Cstrains, suggesting CBP is neither the product of nor regulated by theC gene. Morphological and genetic linkage mapping of the B. mori indicate that the product of the Y gene controls uptake of carotenoids from the midgut (16Doira H. Tajima Y. The Silkworm, An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha, Tokyo1978: 53-81Google Scholar). A mutation in the Y gene produces insects with faint yellow-colored midguts and white cocoons compared with yellow midguts and cocoons of the wild type. To examine whether CBP is the product of the Y gene, midguts and silk glands from four strains with four different genotypes: YI, Y+I, +YI, and +Y+I were used for immunoblotting (Fig. 4). Data clearly demonstrate the presence of the CBP in both midgut and silk gland of only the dominantY gene (YI and Y+I), suggesting that the Y gene might control the expression of the CBP gene or that CBP is the product of the Y gene. Our data do not reveal the connection between CBP and the Y gene but clearly demonstrate that CBP is not limited to the midgut tissue as has been suggested for the Y gene (16Doira H. Tajima Y. The Silkworm, An Important Laboratory Tool. Kodansha, Tokyo1978: 53-81Google Scholar). Fig.5 shows the Western analysis of the silk gland and midgut using anti-LBP or anti-CBP antibodies. Lack of cross-reactivity between CBP and LBP was demonstrated by the inability of either anti-LBP antibody or anti-CBP antibody to recognize the purified CBP (Fig. 5A) and LBP (Fig. 5B), respectively, demonstrating that the two proteins are different. LBP was present in all four mutants: YI, +YI, Y+I, and +Y+I (Fig. 5C), whereas CBP was present only in the Y gene containing mutants (Fig. 5D). Both LBP and CBP purified from B. mori are characterized by their typical carotenoid-bound spectra. The similarity between these proteins is limited to their lipid composition, with lutein being the main bound carotenoids. However, the difference between LBP and CBP is conspicuous at different levels: 1) SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that CBP is a smaller (33 kDa) than LBP (36 kDa); 2) LBP is present in the fat body, whereas CBP is not; 3) LBP is present in all four mutants, but CBP is present only in the Ygene-containing mutants; 4) The isoelectric point of LBP is 5.3 compared with 6.5 for CBP; 5) The ratio of lutein to protein is 3:1 for LBP and 1:1 for CBP; and 6) In addition, the antibodies of CBP or LBP do not cross-react with LBP and CBP, respectively. At the present time, it is not known whether CBP and LBP share the same physiological role. A cDNA library from the silk gland of B. mori N4 strain was prepared in λgt11 and screened using anti-CBP antibody. One positive clone was identified after a primary screen of around 200,000 plaques. This clone contains an 1874 bp insert encoding 296 amino acid residues (Fig. 6). After the termination codon, TGA there were a further 983 bases of untranslated sequence. The 3′-terminus contained a putative polyadenylation signal sequence, AATTAAA with the poly (A) tail beginning at position 2199. However, the 5′-terminus of the cDNA did not contain an ATG start site. A 520 bp product was obtained by 5′ RACE using gene specific primers. The cDNA encoded a putative 5′-untranslated sequence of 345 bp, an ATG start site, and an open reading frame at position 346 and extending to position 1239. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative CBP encoded a 297-residue polypeptide with a molecular weight of 33,636 and an isoelectric point of 6.53. To verify that the obtained cDNA encodes the purified CBP, three peptides acquired from the digestion of the purified CBP with lysyl endopeptidase were sequenced. Sequence analyses of the peptides INEETAERQL, LPEWNPTILK, and EDQALFQW confirmed their presence in the deduced amino acid sequence of the CBP at positions 12–21, 141–150, and 247–254, respectively (Fig. 6, underlined sequences). Thus, the isolated putative cDNA encodes the sequence of the purified CBP. A computer search of the Swiss-Prot data base revealed that the highest homology to CBP is the human, mouse, and bovine steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) proteins, and mouse MLN64 (Fig.7). Sequence identity between B. mori CBP and the human StAR protein (22Sugawara T. Holt J.A. Dricoll D. Strauss III, J.F. Lin D. Miller W.L. Patterson D. Clancy K.P. Hart I.M. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12506-12512Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and the mouse MLN64 protein (23Tomasetto C. Regnier C. Moog-Lutz C. Mattei M.G. Chenard M.P. Lidereau C.R. Basset P. Rio M.C. Genomics. 1995; 28: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) is 25 and 29%, respectively. The mammalian 30-kDa StAR protein plays a crucial role in the transport of cholesterol from the cytoplasm into the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis (24Stocco D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 184-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Christensen L.K. Strauss III, J.F. Biochim. Biophys.

Metabol. 2001; 73: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Analogous to six members of the StAR and MLN64 proteins, the carboxyl terminus of CBP contains a StAR-related lipid transfer domain (START) known to aid in lipid transfer/recognition (27Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The conserved amino acid sequences EWNP at position 339–342 and PRDFV at position 364–368 of CBP are found in all six StAR proteins (Fig. 7, boldfacedsequences). This domain plays a role in binding cholesterol to StAR protein (28Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt H.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). START domain is not unique to cholesterol transport proteins, but it occurs in proteins involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation (30Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). It is present in a putative human acyl-CoA thioesterase, and different phosphatidylcholine transfer proteins (26Achermann J.C. Meeks J.J. Jeffs B. Das U. Clayton P.E. Brook C.G.D. Jameson J.L. Mol. Genet. Metabol. 2001; 73: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Westerman J. Wirtz K.W.A. Berkout T. Van Deenen L.L.M. Radhakrishnan R. Khorana H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the START domain of MLN64 has been determined, and a putative lipid-binding tunnel has been identified that shuttles cholesterol through the intermembrane space of the mitochondria (30Tsujishita Y. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). START consists of nine-stranded twisted antiparallel β-sheets, 4-α-helices, and 2-Ω-loops. The hydrophobic tunnel that extends nearly the entire length of the protein is the most interesting feature of its structure. The presence of different amino acids in the hydrophobic tunnel confers its distinct ligand-binding selectivity (32Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 130-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the CBP START domain exhibits similar biological activity as the MLN64 with the exception that CBP shuttles carotenoids instead of cholesterol. Actually this hydrophobic feature allowed us to follow CBP during its purification and was demonstrated when the yellow rCBP-lutein complex was immunoprecipitated as discussed below. To characterize the biochemical properties of CBP, we utilized the pGX-4T-3 expression vector and E. coli strain BL21 as the host to express CBP. The cloned DNA included cDNA encoding the CBP mature protein, ten histidines at the amino terminus, and glutathioneS-transferase. After cloning was accomplished, the presence of CBP cDNA was verified by colony-directed PCR using gene-specific primers. rCBP was purified from lysed bacteria cells with His-Trap purification kit. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that rCBP had an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa (Fig.8A). This is the predicted size for the CBP plus the ten-histidine extension and the attached glutathione S-transferase. Recombinant CBP was further identified by immunoblotting the 62 kDa rCBP against anti-CBP antibody (Fig. 8B). Lutein binding capacity of CBP was determined by incubating rCBP with lutein under different conditions and immunoprecipitated using anti-CBP IgG conjugated to protein A-Sepharose (Fig.9). Immunoprecipitation of the lutein-rCBP formed a yellow complex (Fig. 9, tube 3). In contrast, no yellow precipitate was observed when lutein was added to BSA (Fig. 9, tube 2) or when rCBP in the absence of lutein was incubated in binding buffer followed by immunoprecipitation (Fig.9, tube 1). The observed yellow precipitate was specific to rCBP-lutein complex, because this complex failed to form in the presence of BSA and lutein or in the presence of lutein alone (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that rCBP displays lutein binding capacity. The midgut from day 4 of 5th instar larvae (wild type, N4), corresponding to the time when the tissue becomes most yellow in color and the point of maximal tissue size, was used for immunohistochemistry (Fig.10). The frozen sections of the midgut were slide-mounted, fixed in acetone, and incubated with anti-CBP antibody. The dark blue stains represent the nuclei. Positive staining of the midgut (light brown) was predominant in the villi, demonstrating that CBP is present in cells along the midgut. Once absorbed, lutein would be captured by CBP, transported to epithelium, and exported to the hemolymph carried by lipophorin. These findings confirm the proposed function of CBP in aiding carotenoids absorption and transport from the lumen to the epithelia cells of the midgut. In this report we described the purification, characterization, and sequence analysis of a carotenoid binding protein from the wild type of silk gland of B. mori. This cytosolic protein represents a new member of the StAR protein family with unique features of binding carotenoids, lutein. Lutein is specifically and stoichiometrically bound to CBP with a ratio of 1 mol of lutein per 1 mol of CBP. Site-directed mutagenesis and cDNA-CBP transient infection of the silk gland cells of white cocoon mutants will be investigated in our future studies."

https://openalex.org/W2023315935,"The ability of scanning tunneling microscopy to probe the pathways of thermally activated high-barrier surface processes is frequently limited by competing low-barrier processes that can confuse measurement of the true initial and final configuration. We introduce an approach to circumvent this difficulty by driving the surface process with nanosecond laser heating. The method is applied to determine the pathway of recombinative desorption in the H/Si(001) system. The observed configuration of dangling bonds after laser heating reveals that the desorbed hydrogen molecules are not formed on single dimers, but rather from neighboring silicon dimers via an interdimer reaction pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1966264336,The inferred crystallographic class of circumstellar silicon carbide based on astronomical infrared spectra is controversial. We have directly determined the polytype distribution of circumstellar SiC from transmission electron microscopy of presolar silicon carbide from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite. Only two polytypes (of a possible several hundred) were observed: cubic 3C and hexagonal 2H silicon carbide and their intergrowths. We conclude that this structural simplicity is a direct consequence of the low pressures in circumstellar outflows and the corresponding low silicon carbide condensation temperatures.
https://openalex.org/W2057426481,"The nene (or Hawaiian goose, Branta sandvicensis) once occurred on most of the main Hawaiian Islands (1), but by Captain Cook’s arrival in 1778, nene were found only on the island of Hawaii (2). A decline that began in the 1800s reduced the nene population to fewer than 30 individuals by the middle of the 20th century (2). Nene currently have extremely low levels of genetic variation (3). We questioned whether this low genetic variation resulted from the recent population decline or was a natural consequence of living on islands (theory and empirical evidence indicate that island taxa should and do have lower genetic variability than mainland ones) (4). Here we report an assessment of genetic variation in samples of nene on the island of Hawaii from four time periods (Fig. 1): 26 extant captive and wild birds, 14 historical museum specimens (collected between 1833 and 1928), 16 bones from archaeological middens [radiocarbon dated at 160 to 500 radiocarbon years before present (rybp)], and 14 bones from paleontological sites (500 to 2540 rybp). We analyzed DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region (CR), following very strict methodologies to avoid and detect contamination in ancient samples (5). We found no variation across 847 nucleotide sites among extant nene (haplotype diversity, H 5 0) and designate this sequence as haplotype RH. For the ancient samples, we obtained sequences of 217 sites from the highly variable left domain of the CR and 92 sites from the less variable right domain (6). Unexpectedly, only one museum specimen sequence differed from the RH haplotype (E1, Fig. 1B), and all archaeological bones (sampled from eight different caves) possessed RH. Only the paleontological nene exhibited levels of CR variation typical of geese (5): six individuals had RH and eight had one of six additional haplotypes (Fig. 1B). H was 0.802 (multinomial lower 95% CI 5 0.67) in the paleontological sample, but only 0.067 (upper 95% CI 5 0.26) in the archaeological and museum specimen samples combined (6). Thus, our results indicate that the nene populations on Hawaii lost most of their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variability long before their historic population decline. Monte Carlo simulations run for 150 generations (about 600 years) suggest that the most likely explanation is a prehistoric population bottleneck (6). A reduction of H from 0.80 to 0.26 in populations of varying size (500 to 10,000) can only occur if the populations decline to fewer than 270 females (for a rate of decline of r 5 20.01) or to fewer than 20 females (for r 5 20.05). In addition, in the absence of population decline, an improbably large selection coefficient of 0.10 would be required to change RH frequency from 0.43 to 0.97 over 150 generations. Our radiocarbon chronology (Fig. 1A) suggests that the nene’s loss of genetic variability took place during a period of prehistoric human population growth (900 to 350 years ago), when settlements expanded into marginal ecological zones (7). Radiocarbon dates (1, 5, 8) indicate that the extirpation of the nene on Kauai and the extinction of at least five of the nine large ground-dwelling Hawaiian birds (1) occurred during this time period. Ecological changes associated with human settlement are assumed to have caused the extinctions (1) and apparently caused a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity in the nene on Hawaii as well. Ultimately, we must ask why the nene population on Hawaii could escape prehistoric extinction while many other Hawaiian birds did not. Cultural changes may have created better conditions for nene, such as more open habitat, while at the same time warfare may have created noman’s-lands safer for wildlife. Prohibitions by ruling elites (kapu) may have protected the birds, and it is possible that they were even brought under domestication or semidomestication. Paleontological studies have shown how broadly devastating the impact of prehistoric humans was on insular organisms, as most vividly shown by the total extinction of hundreds of species (1). Our findings demonstrate that these prehistoric influences may still be reflected in the genetic makeup of insular species that survived until the present, many of which, like the nene, are endangered. In addition, we have confirmed that at least one islanddwelling species, the nene, did not always have the low genetic variability predicted by its history as an island taxon (4)."

https://openalex.org/W1976551786,"Cytohesin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of small GTPases. All of the members of the cytohesin family (including ARNO, ARNO3, and the newly characterized cytohesin-4) have a similar domain distribution consisting of a Sec7 homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and an N-terminal coiled coil. In this study, we attempt to identify proteins that interact specifically with the coiled coil motif of cytohesin. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a B cell library using the cytohesin N terminus as bait, identified CASP, a scaffolding protein of previously unknown function, as a binding partner. CASP contains an internal coiled coil motif that is required for cytohesin binding both in vitro and in COS-1 cells. The specificity of the coiled coil of CASP is not restricted to cytohesin, however, because it is also capable of interacting with other members of the cytohesin/ARNO family, ARNO and ARNO3. In immunofluorescence experiments, CASP localizes to perinuclear tubulovesicular structures that are in close proximity to the Golgi. These structures remain relatively undisturbed when the cells are treated with brefeldin A. In epidermal growth factor-stimulated COS-1 cells overexpressing cytohesin and CASP, cytohesin recruits CASP to membrane ruffles, revealing a functional interaction between the two proteins. These observations collectively suggest that CASP is a scaffolding protein that facilitates the function of at least one member of the cytohesin/ARNO family in response to specific cellular stimuli. Cytohesin is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family of small GTPases. All of the members of the cytohesin family (including ARNO, ARNO3, and the newly characterized cytohesin-4) have a similar domain distribution consisting of a Sec7 homology domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, and an N-terminal coiled coil. In this study, we attempt to identify proteins that interact specifically with the coiled coil motif of cytohesin. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a B cell library using the cytohesin N terminus as bait, identified CASP, a scaffolding protein of previously unknown function, as a binding partner. CASP contains an internal coiled coil motif that is required for cytohesin binding both in vitro and in COS-1 cells. The specificity of the coiled coil of CASP is not restricted to cytohesin, however, because it is also capable of interacting with other members of the cytohesin/ARNO family, ARNO and ARNO3. In immunofluorescence experiments, CASP localizes to perinuclear tubulovesicular structures that are in close proximity to the Golgi. These structures remain relatively undisturbed when the cells are treated with brefeldin A. In epidermal growth factor-stimulated COS-1 cells overexpressing cytohesin and CASP, cytohesin recruits CASP to membrane ruffles, revealing a functional interaction between the two proteins. These observations collectively suggest that CASP is a scaffolding protein that facilitates the function of at least one member of the cytohesin/ARNO family in response to specific cellular stimuli. guanine nucleotide exchange factor pleckstrin homology brefeldin A endoplasmic reticulum amino acid(s) glutathioneS-transferase cytomegalovirus hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline epidermal growth factor ADP-ribosylation factor The cytohesin/ARNO family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1 characterized by an N-terminal coiled coil, a Sec7 homology domain, and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, have emerged as regulators of the ARF family of small GTPases (1Chardin P.

Class I ARFs (ARFs 1–3) are Golgi-associated GTPases regulating vesicle formation (4Stearns T. Willingham M.C. Botstein D. Kahn R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Little is known about class II ARFs (ARFs 4 and 5), except that ARF5 may be involved in brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant Golgi/ER retrograde traffic (7Claude A. Zhao B.P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melancon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARF6, the only member of class III ARFs, associates with cell membranes and is involved in endocytosis and actin rearrangements (8D'Souza Schorey C., Li, G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D.

The study of ARF function has been focusing primarily on the ER and Golgi where different anterograde and retrograde vesicle trafficking pathways occur. It is generally accepted that coat protein complex (COP) II-coated vesicles budding from the ER carry cargo proteins to the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment where they are replaced by coat protein complex (COP) I-coated vesicles (11Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 38-43Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Sar1 is the major small GTPase implicated in the formation of these vesicles (12Aridor M. Weissman J.

The cytohesin/ARNO GEFs regulate ARFs through the Sec7 homology domain by facilitating a GDP/GTP exchange, converting inactive GDP-bound ARFs to their active GTP-bound state (1Chardin P. Paris S.

The first was originally cloned in our laboratory and was designated B2-1 (17Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It was later renamed by others as cytohesin-1 (18Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). ARNO is also known as cytohesin-2, and ARNO3 is the human homolog of mouse GRP1 (19Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S. Monier S. Goud B. Chardin P. Chavrier P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Another member of the cytohesin/ARNO family, cytohesin-4, was recently identified in blood cells (20Ogasawara M. Kim S.C. Adamik R. Togawa A. Ferrans V.J. Takeda K. Kirby M. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3221-3320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To simplify nomenclature, we will follow the designations published in GenBankTM: cytohesin-1, ARNO, ARNO3, and cytohesin-4. The specificity of cytohesin/ARNO members to the various ARFs appears to be mediated primarily by the Sec7 domain. All cytohesin/ARNO members activate ARF-1 (19Franco M. Boretto J. Robineau S.

All four members of the family are highly similar on a structural basis. In addition to the Sec7 homology domain, the C-terminal PH domain allows cytohesin/ARNO interactions with membranes by binding to various polyphosphoinositides (24Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. J.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the PH domains of cytohesin-1 and ARNO seem to bind nonselectively to various phosphoinositides, ARNO3 shows increased affinity to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a product of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (26Klarlund J.K.

Chawla A. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 385-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Generally, whereas the PH domain anchors the cytohesin/ARNO GEFs to membrane structures, the Sec7 domain facilitates the function of ARF in vesicle formation. The N-terminal coiled coil motif, reminiscent of leucine zipper domains, is a signature domain of all the cytohesin/ARNO members and still the most elusive. Recently, we showed that this domain targets the cytohesin/ARNO proteins to the Golgi (29Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee S.Y. Mansour M. Pohajdak B. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The coiled coil motif most likely interacts with at least one adaptor protein that contains a similar domain and facilitates the higher architecture of signaling complexes that regulate vesicle formation. The only protein known to interact with the N terminus of a cytohesin/ARNO protein (mouse homolog of ARNO3, GRP1), is GRASP, a scaffolding protein of unknown function containing a coiled coil domain (31Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report the interaction of cytohesin/ARNO proteins, particularly cytohesin, with a GRASP-related scaffolding protein, CASP, originally cloned in our laboratory from Natural Killer-enriched human lymphocytes (32Dixon B. Sahely B. Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). CASP and GRASP share a similar domain profile, with an N-terminal PDZ domain, a central coiled coil motif, and C-terminal domain of unknown function. A cytohesin fragment coding for residues 1–68 (cytohesin-N) (29Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in frame into theNcoI site of the plasmid vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH) downstream from sequences encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4 BD). A human B cell cDNA library subcloned into the XhoI site of the activation domain plasmid pACT2 (CLONTECH) and the PJ69-4A yeast strain for the yeast two-hybrid analysis were generous gifts from Dr. C. McMaster (Biochemistry Department, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada). A cytohesin-N BamHI fragment coding for a.a. 1–54 was subcloned in pRSET A (Invitrogen) for generating recombinant His6-cytohesin-N fusion protein. Plasmids for generating recombinant GST/CASP fusions (CASP a.a. 151–201 and a.a. 151- 241) were prepared by amplifying the CASP cDNA region coding for the coiled coil motif, PCRII cloning of the PCR fragments (Invitrogen), and then subcloning into the appropriate pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences). The sense primer used for amplifying the coiled coil region was 5′-AAGCTTATCAGATCGTCCGGAAACCTGC-3′. Antisense primers were AS5 (5′-AGACGATGTTCCTGTAACTGC-3′) and bish2 (5′-TGGATAATCGATTCCGGTCC-3′). Recombinant GST/CASP proteins lacking a significant portion of the coiled coil domain (a.a. 179–195) were generated in a similar manner using a CASP cDNA with an internalPstI deletion. CASP cDNA with the stop codon removed and CASP cDNA coding for the coiled coil domain (CASP (CC)) were subcloned into a modified (leader sequence removed) Sec Tag vector (Invitrogen), designated Sec CMV. In these constructs, the CASP full cDNA and the CASP coiled coil cDNA portion were cloned in frame with downstream sequences encoding Myc and His6 tags and was under the control of the CMV promotor. PstI deletion mutants of CASP and CASP (CC) lacking the majority of the coiled coil motif (CASP* and CASP (CC*), respectively) were subcloned into Sec CMV in a similar manner. Primers used for amplifying the CASP (CC) and (CC*) cDNA were ZipATG (5′-GACCTGATGAGATCGTCCGGAAACCTGCTAAC-3′) and ZipAS1 (5′-CAGACAATTCATCCAAGTCCATG-3′). Cytohesin full cDNA containing a stop codon was cloned into the Sec CMV vector downstream from an HA tag. Cytohesin-N, ARNO2-N, and ARNO3-N fragments corresponding to the N termini of cytohesin, ARNO, and ARNO3, respectively (29Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar) were subcloned into a CMV/HA/Myc plasmid in frame with upstream sequences encoding an HA tag and downstream sequences encoding a Myc tag under the control of the CMV promotor. COS-1 cells used for transfections were generously provided by Dr. K. Too (Biochemistry Department, Dalhousie University), and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cytohesin-N/pAS2-1 bait vector was transformed into PJ69-4A cells using a standard LiAc transformation protocol. Yeast were plated on minimal medium deficient in Trp. Resistant yeast clones were grown overnight at 30 °C degrees in the same medium, and Gal4 BD/B2-1 fusion protein production was confirmed by Western blot analysis of yeast lysates using anti-Gal4 BD monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Yeast containing the bait construct were then transformed with 25 μg of the human B cell cDNA pACT2 library, plated on minimal medium lacking Trp/Leu/His and 50 mm 3-aminotriazole, and incubated at 30 degrees for 5 days until colonies appeared. The colonies were patched onto a new Trp−/Leu−/His−/3-aminotriazole plate, grown overnight, and transferred onto nitrocellulose filter paper for a secondary β-galactosidase screen. Positive yeast clones were grown overnight and lysed with glass beads to retrieve pACT2 plasmids. pACT2 inserts were amplified by PCR using primers gad5 (5′-GCGTTTGGAATCACTACAGGG-3′) and gad3 (5′-GGTGCACGATGCACAGTTGAA-3′), cloned into the PCR II vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced commercially using an automated fluorescent Licor sequencer. The sequences were analyzed on-line using the BLAST search program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website. To purify GST fusion proteins, DH5α cells harboring the CASP/pGEX constructs were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were sonicated briefly in PBS 1% with Triton X-100, and the lysates were incubated with glutathione beads (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended as a 50% slurry in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. To purify His6/Cytohesin-N, ARNO-N, or ARNO3-N fusion proteins, 100 ml of BL21(DE3) pLysS cells (Invitrogen) harboring each of the cytohesin, ARNO, and ARNO3 N-terminal pRSET constructs were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were sonicated briefly in 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 8.0, prior to incubation with 200 μl of nickel beads (Qiagen). The beads were washed twice with 8 m urea, pH 8.0, and the proteins were refolded on the beads by sequentially washing in decreasing concentration of urea and increasing volumes of PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100. The beads were finally washed twice in PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, and the bound proteins were eluted with 700 μl of 0.5 m immidizole in PBS. 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol was added to maintain solubility. Binding assays were performed by incubating 10 μl of glutathione beads with bound GST fusion proteins with 50 μl of His6/cytohesin-N, ARNO-N, or ARNO3-N eluate in 500 μl of Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 and 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature. The glutathione beads were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline with Tween and subjected to PAGE. Bound His6/Cytohesin-N, ARNO-N, or ARNO3-N fusion proteins were detected by monoclonal His6antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences). COS-1 cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected the following day with 0.5 μg of the appropriate CASP/Sec CMV construct (CASP (CC) or CASP (CC*)), 0.5 μg of either cytohesin-N, ARNO-N, or ARNO3-N/CMV/HA/Myc construct, and 4 μl of Superfect (Qiagen), in the presence of fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The cells were lysed 24 h post-transfection in 1 ml of 1× Tris-buffered saline with Tween supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin. First, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min and then incubated with 1 μg of polyclonal anti-HA antibodies (Santa Cruz) and 10 μl of 50% agarose bead slurry (Santa Cruz) at room temperature with constant agitation for 30 min. The beads were washed once with 1× Tris-buffered saline with Tween and subjected to PAGE. CASP and cytohesin/ARNO/ARNO3 proteins were detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz) and ECL (AmershamBiosciences). COS-1 cells grown on glass coverslips in 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of CASP/CMV plasmid and 4 μl of Superfect (Qiagen). 0.5 μg of CASP or CASP* were also doubly transfected with 0.5 μg of cytohesin in the same manner. 22 h post-transfection, the cells were starved for 2 h in a balanced salt solution (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 5 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mmNaHCO3, and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml of murine EGF for 3 min at 37 °C. Unstimulated and EGF-stimulated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.2) for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with goat serum at 1:100 dilution in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. Primary and secondary antibody (1:1000 in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) incubations were 20 min each at room temperature. Receptor grade murine EGF was purchased from Sigma. Anti-Myc antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Polyclonal anti-cytohesin antibodies were a generous gift from Dr. Bourgoin (Laval). CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. Yeast two-hybrid screening based on the Gal4 system and using cytohesin a.a. 1–54 as bait identified three potential clones. Interaction of all three clones with the N terminus of cytohesin was confirmed in yeast by patch plating and repeated secondary β-galactosidase screenings. All three clones were sequenced, two of which corresponded to CASP, a gene originally cloned in our laboratory from a human Natural Killer-enriched population of lymphocytes (32Dixon B. Sahely B. Liu L. Pohajdak B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The third clone corresponded to a tRNA gene and was unlikely to be a true binding partner of cytohesin. Both isolated CASP clones were identical and most likely represent multiple copies of the same clone in the library. The interacting CASP clones code for a truncated CASP protein that includes the carboxyl terminus and the entirety of the coiled coil domain (Fig. 1). The presence of coiled coil motifs in both the bait and the target proteins suggested to us that the cytohesin/CASP interaction was mediated by these motifs and prompted us to confirm this interaction in vitro and in a cellular system. The N terminus of cytohesin harbors a coiled coil motif that most likely interacts with another coiled coil domain. The presence of such a domain in the truncated CASP protein expressed in yeast prompted us to confirm the interaction of cytohesin with the CASP coiled coil in vitro. We were unable to produce recombinant CASP protein efficiently in Escherichia colibecause it had a tendency to precipitate. We therefore made shorter GST fusion proteins that specifically included the coiled coil domain of CASP (Fig. 2, A and B). These proteins were more soluble, particularly if they were used shortly after they were produced. We also circumvented the solubility problem by keeping the GST recombinant proteins coupled to the glutathione beads before performing the binding assays. Additionally, we produced deletion mutants of the same CASP proteins lacking a significant portion of the coiled coil. In addition to the removal of key elements of the coiled coil, this deletion also affected the secondary structure of the remaining α-helix. Recombinant N-terminal cytohesin (cytohesin-N) corresponding to a.a.1–54 and fused to a His6 tag was produced in E. coli and tested for its interaction with the CASP/GST proteins. Recombinant cytohesin-N could only be captured in vitro by CASP bound to glutathione beads when the coiled coil of CASP remained intact. The deletion mutants of CASP on the other hand (LC* and SC*) failed to interact with cytohesin-N (Fig. 2C). We attempted to confirm the validity of the cytohesin/CASP interaction that we observed in vitro by co-transfecting COS-1 cells with cytohesin-N and CASP coiled coil domain (CASP (CC)) and testing for an interaction in COS-1 lysates. CASP expressed in eukaryotic cells cannot be detected with our anti-CASP antibodies generated against recombinant protein, possibly as a result of fundamental differences in CASP protein folding and/or post-translational modifications in eukaryotic cells. It was therefore necessary to fuse CASP (CC) with a Myc tag for detection by Western blotting. A His6 tag was also fused to CASP (CC) in the hope of using nickel beads on COS-1 lysates to co-purify cytohesin-N, but the nickel beads showed high nonspecific affinity to COS-1 lysates. We therefore turned to co-immunoprecipitating cytohesin-N and CASP (CC) using anti-HA and anti-cytohesin antibodies. Cytohesin-N was also fused to a Myc tag for detection by Western blotting using anti-Myc antibodies. CASP (CC) readily co-precipitated with cytohesin-N from transfected COS-1 lysates using anti-HA antibodies (Fig.3). This interaction is specific to the coiled coil domain of CASP because the deletion mutant CASP (CC*) lacking the same portion of the coiled coil domain as the recombinant mutant CASP constructs used in the in vitro assay showed no interaction with cytohesin-N (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CASP (CC) was not precipitated with protein A-agarose beads and antibodies without the presence of cytohesin-N. Expression of the appropriate proteins in COS-1 cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitating Myc-labeled proteins from lysates of the same transfections using anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3C). All members of the cytohesin/ARNO family are characterized by an N-terminal coiled coil motif. We therefore examined the binding specificity of CASP to the various members of this family of GEFs, including ARNO and ARNO3. Recombinant proteins corresponding to the N termini of ARNO and ARNO3 (ARNO-N and ARNO3-N) harboring the coiled coil motif were produced in E. coli and tested for their ability to interact with GST/CASP recombinant proteins in vitro. Both ARNO-N and ARNO3-N were capable of interacting with an intact CASP coiled coil domain but not with the deletion variant of the same protein (Fig. 4). These interactions were confirmed in COS-1 cells by co-transfecting HA-tagged ARNO-N or ARNO3-N with either CASP (CC) or CASP (CC*) and co-immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. CASP (CC) but not the deletion variant co-precipitated with both ARNO-N and ARNO3-N from COS-1 lysates (Fig.5A). CASP shows no differential specificity to the various members of the cytohesin/ARNO family in both our in vitro and COS-1 binding assays.FIG. 5CASP interaction with ARNO-N and ARNO3-Nin vivo is mediated by the coiled coil domain.A, cDNA sequences coding for ARNO a.a. 1–53 (A) and ARNO3 a.a. 1–58 (A3) were cloned downstream from an HA tag sequence and upstream from a Myc tag sequence under the control of the CMV promotor. COS-1 cells were transfected with ARNO, ARNO3, and CASP (CC)/CASP (CC*) plasmids as indicated. ARNO, ARNO3, CASP (CC), and CASP (CC*) proteins were detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. B, expression of ARNO, ARNO3, CASP (CC) and CASP (CC*) in COS-1 cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged proteins with polyclonal anti-Myc antibodies followed by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies. ARNO and ARNO3 are indicated with double arrowheads. CASP (CC) and CASP (CC*) are indicated withsingle arrowheads.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that the cytohesin, ARNO, and ARNO3 localize to the Golgi through their coiled coil motifs. We suspected that CASP may be a Golgi protein because it interacts with all three members of the cytohesin/ARNO family. Immunolocalization of CASP in transfected COS-1 cells clearly shows a perinuclear signal that is characteristic of the Golgi. To our surprise, however, CASP did not co-localize with the Golgi marker mannosidase II (Fig.6) or giantin (not shown), nor did it co-localize with the ER marker GRP78 (data not shown). It did, however, partially overlap with the ER/Golgi intermediate marker ERGIC-53. This partial overlap was more evident when COS-1 cells were treated with BFA, causing the redistribution of both ERGIC-53 and CASP into similar tubular structures (Fig. 7). BFA caused the relocation of mannosidase II into the ER as expected (33Fullekrug J. Sonnichsen B. Schafer U. Nguyen Van P. Soling H.D. Mieskes G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The CASP-stained tubulovesicular structures were in proximity to, but clearly distinct from, the Golgi and the ERGIC-53-associated structures.FIG. 7Partial overlap of CASP and ERGIC-53 in COS-1 cells. CASP-transfected COS-1 cells were doubly immunostained with monoclonal anti-ERGIC-53/Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (A and D) and polyclonal anti-Myc/CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies (B and E). BFA treatment caused the redistribution of both ERGIC-53 and CASP into vesicular structures. ERGIC-53 and CASP partial overlap (superimposedpanels C and F) was observed with and without BFA treatment. The same results (I) were observed when transfected COS-1 cells treated with BFA were stained with anti-ERGIC-53/Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (G) and polyclonal anti-Myc/Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibodies (H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cytohesin localizes to the Golgi when expressed at low levels in COS-1 cells (29Lee S.Y.

Gunn-Moore F. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpressed cytohesin can be targeted to Chinese hamster ovary and PC-12 membranes by the appropriate extracellular stimuli. Similarly, redistribrution of GRP1 (ARNO-3) was observed by others in COS-1 cells stimulated with EGF (22Langille S.E. Patki V. Klarlund J.K. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Chawla A. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27099-27104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We examined the localization of cytohesin in COS-1 cells upon EGF stimulation and found that cytohesin, like GRP1, translocated to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8, A and B). Full-length CASP and CASP*, a deletion mutant of CASP lacking a portion of the coiled coil domain, exhibited perinuclear localization that was unaffected by EGF stimulation (Fig. 8, C–F). When cytohesin was co-expressed with CASP, however, EGF stimulation caused the translocation of both cytohesin and CASP to membrane ruffles (Fig. 9, D–F). In unstimulated cells, both CASP and cytohesin exhibited a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with little membrane association. CASP perinuclear localization in these cells was disrupted presumably as a result of cytohesin sequestering CASP through the coiled coil-mediated interaction. EGF-induced redistribution of CASP to membrane ruffles in the presence of cytohesin is clearly dependent on the CASP coiled coil motif, because the deletion mutant CASP* failed to relocate under the same conditions (Fig. 9, J–L). Furthermore, CASP recruitment to membrane ruffles is mediated by cytohesin because CASP could not relocate to ruffles when expressed alone (Fig. 8).FIG. 9Co-localization of CASP and cytohesin in EGF-stimulated COS-1. COS-1 cells were transfected with cytohesin (HA-tagged)/CASP (Myc-tagged) (A–F) or cytohesin/CASP* (G–L) and then induced with EGF for 3 min (D–Fand J–L). Cytohesin was detected with polyclonal anti-HA antibodies and Alexa488 secondary antibodies (A, D, G, and J). CASP and CASP* proteins were detected with monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies and CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies (B, E, H, and K). Cytohesin/CASP and cytohesin/CASP* images were superimposed (C, F, I, and L). Identical results were obtained when Cytohesin was detected with a polyclonal anti-Cytohesin antibody (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We took a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify proteins that specifically interact with the coiled coil domain found in the N terminus of cytohesin. Using cytohesin amino acids 1–54 as bait, we identified CASP as a potential binding partner. CASP was originally cloned in our laboratory from a Natural Killer/T cell population. EST database searches suggest the expression of CASP in other cell types such as CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, germinal center B cells, and activated T cells, as well as a number of cancers including adenocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, myeloma, melanoma, and lymphoma. CASP contains at least two known protein interaction domains: an N-terminal PDZ domain and a coiled coil motif. The presence of a coiled coil in CASP suggested to us that the cytohesin/CASP interaction is mediated by this motif. In vitro binding assays with partial CASP recombinant proteins containing primarily the coiled coil motif and deletion mutants of the same protein in which the coiled coil motif is impaired clearly demonstrate that this region of CASP specifically interacts with the coiled coil of cytohesin. Additionally, interaction assays in COS-1 cells expressing coiled coil constructs of cytohesin, CASP, and coiled coil deletion mutants of CASP show that the cytohesin/CASP interaction is specifically mediated by the coiled coil motifs. CASP was identified by others as a cytohesin-interacting protein by yeast two hybrid screening of a differential expression dendritic cell library and was submitted to GenBankTM as a cytohesin-binding protein (accession number AF068836). In that case, however, the entirety of cytohesin was used as bait, and the protein segments responsible for the interaction were never published. We are the first to confirm such an interaction both in vitro and in a cellular system, as well as to identify the domains responsible for this interaction. The specificity of the CASP coiled coil domain was tested by examining the interaction of CASP with other members of cytohesin/ARNO family, particularly ARNO and ARNO-3. All three members are associated with the Golgi of COS-1 cells (29Lee S.Y. Pohajdak B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1883-1889PubMed Google Scholar) and most likely play specific roles in ARF-mediated vesicle formation. CASP is capable of interacting with all three members of the family, at least in our experimental system. There may be differential specificity with the various ARNOs at a lower expression level than that induced by the CMV promotor, but that remains to be tested. We were unable to test such an interaction by co-immunoprecipitating proteins from normal cell lysates due to the lack of functional CASP antibodies. Nonetheless, our data suggest that CASP may regulate or facilitate a specialized aspect of vesicle transport that involves at least one member of the cytohesin family in hematopoietic cells. The interaction of CASP with cytohesin/ARNO/ARNO3 in COS-1 cells suggests an association of CASP with the Golgi complex. Immunofluorescence experiments clearly showed the association of CASP with Golgi proximal structures. Co-localization studies with Golgi markers, on the other hand, showed that CASP was not directly associated with the Golgi. The only marker tested that exhibited partial overlap was ERGIC-53, a well recognized component of the ER-Golgi intermediate region (35Schweizer A. Ericsson M. Bachi T. Griffiths G. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 671-683Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This partial overlap persisted even after BFA treatment, which caused the redistribution of both CASP and ERGIC-53 into similar but not identical tubulovesicular structures. Others have shown that BFA treatment causes the dissociation of the Golgi stack and the recycling of some Golgi components such as mannosidase II into the ER, whereas other components such as ERGIC-53 and the Golgin GM130 cluster in distinct tubulovesicular structures (34Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It appears that CASP is associated with a dynamic compartment that normally interacts with the Golgi and fuses with vesicular Golgi remnants after BFA treatment. This compartment may be part of the ER/Golgi intermediate region but is clearly distinct from the ERGIC-53-associated structures. The physical interaction of CASP with cytohesin and the apparent association of CASP and cytohesin proteins with different but overlapping compartments of the perinuclear region most likely reflect the dynamic or inducible nature of the function of CASP. The physical interaction of endogenous CASP and cytohesin and/or ARNO/ARNO3 at the Golgi may require stimuli that remain unidentified to date. Intracellular localization studies in EGF-stimulated COS-1 cells overexpressing CASP and cytohesin clearly show the functional interaction of the two proteins. Furthermore, the coiled coil interaction is responsible for the co-localization observed. The translocation of CASP in the presence of cytohesin upon EGF stimulation is likely mediated by the PH domain of cytohesin, a property of cytohesin reported by others in PC-12 cells (25Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1957-1965PubMed Google Scholar). Cytohesin translocation to membranes is similar to GRP1 and ARNO translocation reported by other groups (24Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the ability of all three proteins to activate ARF6 in vitro and more importantly membrane bound ARF6 in vivo (21Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 37Venkateswarlu K. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CASP overexpressed alone failed to localize to the membrane, most likely as a result of the overwhelming CASP levels compared with endogenous cytohesin (and potentially ARNO/ARNO3) levels. The inability of CASP to disrupt cytohesin translocation to the membrane in response to EGF is expected because the interaction of cytohesin with CASP and membranes is mediated by two different domains: the coiled coil and the PH domain, respectively. The association of CASP and cytohesin at membranes following EGF stimulation suggests that cytohesin is capable of recruiting CASP to the appropriate site of activity in response to specific stimuli. Interestingly, CASP is not the only protein capable of interacting with cytohesin/ARNO proteins through their N-terminal coiled coil domain. GRASP (GRP1-associated scaffolding protein), the only other known member of the CASP family, was recently cloned from a mouse library and shown to interact with both ARNO and GRP1 (ARNO3) (31Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Hansen S.G. Dowell P. Hruby D.E. Dawson M.I. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16827-16836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). GRASP expression is induced by trans-retinoic acid in embryonal carcinoma PC19 cells, and its interaction with GRP1 occurs at the cell periphery. The ability of GRASP to interact with cytohesin was never established because it is not expressed in PC19 cells. The structural similarity between CASP and GRASP and their capability of interacting with multiple members of the cytohesin/ARNO family suggest that the CASP/GRASP family of scaffolding proteins plays a role in ARF-mediated vesicle formation at a number of cellular locations. CASP and GRASP are likely to be recruited by cytohesin/ARNO members and may act as scaffolding proteins to bring in other proteins to the site of activity. Other domains of CASP and GRASP, particularly the PDZ domain and the uncharacterized C-terminal domain, may also target those proteins to the site of their function or may recruit additional proteins into a larger signaling complex. In any case, the roles of CASP and GRASP are clearly not ubiquitous, because GRASP is only expressed in response to trans-retinoic acid stimulation, and both CASP and GRASP show tissue-specific distributions. In summary, we identified the first protein to interact with the N-terminal coiled coil domain of cytohesin. The hematopoietic expression of CASP suggests a role for CASP in a cell type-specific inducible aspect of vesicle formation, either at the level of the Golgi or a membrane-associated signaling event, by interacting with the appropriate cytohesin/ARNO member(s) and their target ARF(s). We are currently trying to further pinpoint the perinuclear compartment targeted by CASP as well as map the region responsible for this perinuclear localization. CASP may represent a scaffolding protein that regulates a novel pathway of vesicle formation and trafficking."

AP-1 activity converts extracellular signals into changes in gene expression patterns through the binding of AP-1 dimers to specific target sequences located within the promoters and enhancers of target genes. These targets include genes important for regulating many biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation (2Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

Although the three Jun proteins share a high level of sequence and functional homology, they exhibit distinct expression patterns during development and differ in their transcriptional and biological activities (12Jochum W.

Regulation of the Jun proteins occurs at the level of transcription and through post-transcriptional modifications, primarily phosphorylation. A subgroup of the MAP1 kinase family that helps to regulate Jun and AP-1 activity is that of the Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). JNKs are known to phosphorylate residues located in the N-terminal region of c-Jun and activate its transcription (20Smeal T. Binetruy B. Mercola D.A. Birrer M. Karin M.

Kouzarides T. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2509-2514PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient phosphorylation of these sites requires the structural integrity of a JNK-binding domain located adjacent to the target residues (29Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). The specificity of JNK and other MAP kinase signaling is conveyed, in part, by the binding of kinases to “docking” sequences present in the proteins they interact with. These interacting proteins include upstream MAP kinase kinases, phosphatases, substrate proteins (e.g. transcription factors), and scaffold proteins (31Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem.

The docking sequences are highly conserved and modular, allowing the identification of consensus sequences for particular MAP kinase families that are useful for functional analyses and for finding novel MAP kinase-interacting proteins. JNK phosphorylation target sites are present in the JunD protein, and phosphorylation of JunD by JNK has been detected in several studies (16Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S.

Two distinct isoforms of JunD are ubiquitously expressed, JunD full-length (JunD-FL) and ΔJunD (37Lallemand D. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. Pfarr C.M.

These two JunD isoforms are generated by the use of two highly conserved translation start codons within a single JunD mRNA, and the two proteins differ only in a 48-amino acid N-terminal extension present in the mouse JunD full-length protein (43 amino acids in the human protein). Both JunD isoforms retain prospective JNK target sequences. Here we report that JunD-FL and ΔJunD are phosphorylated by JNK at the same three residues but with different efficiencies. Further, we have characterized a functional JNK docking domain present in both JunD isoforms and identified amino acid residues that are essential for JNK docking activity. These similarities and differences in the interactions of JunD-FL and ΔJunD with JNKs are likely to be reflected in distinct transcriptional and biological properties between these two proteins. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium (CellGro) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.) and penicillin/streptomycin (BioWhittaker) under standard conditions.

The cells were lysed by pipetting repeatedly. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1% after lysis. The lysate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. Glutathione-coated agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the supernatant, allowed to bind for 2–3 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with lysis buffer. To cleave the GST moiety from the recombinant protein, beads bound to the GST fusion proteins were digested with thrombin (Sigma; 40 units/ml of protein bound beads) in thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). For purification, GST fusion proteins were eluted from the beads in elution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 9.0, 0.5m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mmreduced glutathione; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and dialyzed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 20 mm MgCl2. JNK proteins were prepared using a coupled in vitrotranscription/translation system (TNT, Promega) that was supplemented with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran-S-label, ICN). Each 35S-labeled JNK mixture was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and the incorporated label was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics model 445SI). Equal amounts of each JNK were used for in vitro binding assays, taking into account the number of methionine and cysteine residues present in each JNK sequence. Binding assays were performed using 10 μg of each GST fusion protein, the appropriate volume of JNK-programmed TNT lysate and 20 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose beads in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 4 μg/ml each of aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 1 h. Following centrifugation, the beads were washed three times in binding buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the complexes were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose, and the amount of 35S-labeled JNK associated with the GST-Jun proteins was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. For the kinase assays, the reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl using ∼0.5 μg of each substrate GST fusion protein (corrected for molecular mass to yield equimolar amounts of substrate proteins). For kinase assays using free peptides 0.15 μg of JunD-FL (1–115) and 0.09 μg of ΔJunD (49–115) were used. Substrate proteins were mixed with 0.2 μl of TNT lysate programmed with cDNA for JNK2α1 in the presence of 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophospate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate) at room temperature for 1 h or for the indicated times. The protein complexes were detected and quantified as described above. Equimolar amounts of the wild-type or mutant (S90A, S100A, and S90A/S100A) forms of the purified GST-JunD (1–115) and GST-ΔJunD (49–115) proteins were phosphorylated in vitro as described above. The proteins were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The labeled recombinant proteins were located by a brief film exposure and excised. Following digestion of the sample with trypsin, the peptides generated were separated by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension using a Hunter thin layer peptide mapping electrophoresis system (model HTLE-7000) and ascending chromatography in the second dimension (42Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The 32P signals were detected using autoradiography and a PhosphorImager. CHO cells were plated at a density of 45,000 cells/well in 24-well plates, 24 h before transfection. 0.3 μg of the reporter plasmid G5-E1b-Luc along with 2 ng of pGAL4-Jun encoding each of the GAL4-Jun fusion proteins, and when indicated, 25 ng of pSR-α3HA-JNK1 and 13 ng of pSR-α3HA-JNKK2 were transfected into the cells using Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested by incubation in passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature with agitation. The luciferase activity in the extracts was measured in a Turner Designs luminometer (model 20/20) using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as per the manufacturer's instructions. CHO cells were transfected with 0.25 μg of the expression plasmids in 24-well plates. After 24 h, they were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Whole cell extracts were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Nonspecific interactions were blocked by preincubation of the membranes with 5% nonfat powdered milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. GAL4-Jun fusion proteins were detected using α-GAL4 mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (SC-510; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HA-tagged JNK1 and JNKK2 were detected using α-HA antibody (SC-7392; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Labs) was used for the secondary antibody. The blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce) and imaged using a Digital Imager (Alpha Innotech Corporation). CHO cells were transfected with 5 μg of pGAL4-JunD (1–149), and 2.5 μg each of pSR-α3HA-JNK1 and pSR-α3HA-JNKK2 when indicated using the Cytofectene transfection reagent (Bio-Rad). 24 h after transfections, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 20 min as indicated and lysed in 0.5 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml each of aprotonin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.25 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. 2 μg of α-GAL4 antibody (SC-510; Santa Cruz) was added to the lysates, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. 30 μl of protein G-coated magnetic beads (Dynal ASA) were added and allowed to bind for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resuspended in 1× nonreducing SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with anti-phospho-c-Jun (antibody 659; Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) or anti-phosphoserine 63 monoclonal antibody (43Lallemand D. Ham J. Garbay S. Bakiri L. Traincard F. Jeannequin O. Pfarr C.M. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5615-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because the direct interaction of JunD with JNKs has not been studied extensively, we first tested phosphorylation of recombinant JunD proteins by JNKs in vitro. Two forms of JunD are generated from a single intron-less messenger RNA through use of an alternative translational start site: the full-length isoform (JunD-FL) and the truncated isoform (ΔJunD) that lacks the N-terminal 48 amino acids (Fig. 1A). GST fusion proteins containing N-terminal JunD fragments corresponding to JunD-FL and ΔJunD were purified from bacteria and used as substrates for phosphorylation by JNK2α1. A schematic of the various constructs used in these assays is presented in Fig. 1B. Two fusion fragments were used for each JunD isoform, a short (amino acids 1–115 for JunD-FL and 49–115 for ΔJunD) and a longer fragment (amino acids 1–149 for JunD-FL and 49–149 for ΔJunD). Two similar fusion proteins were prepared for c-Jun and a single fusion protein for JunB. JNK2α1 was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation (TNT; Promega). As shown in Fig.2A, both of the longer GST-JunD isoforms (through amino acid 149) were readily labeled, although less rapidly than c-Jun. In addition, JunD-FL was more efficiently phosphorylated than ΔJunD. Similar results were obtained when the shorter (through amino acid 115) JunD fusion proteins were tested (Fig. 2B). A slightly larger difference between JunD-FL and ΔJunD was observed with these shorter proteins.FIG. 2JunD-FL is phosphorylated more extensively than ΔJunD by JNK2α1in vitro. A, equal amounts of purified GST-JunD-FL (1–149), GST-JunD (49–149), and GST-c-Jun (1–123) fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated Jun N-terminal kinase 2α1 (JNK2α1) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The aliquots were taken at timed intervals, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the incorporated 32P signal was detected using a PhosphorImager instrument. The 32P signals depicted in theupper panel were quantified and plotted against time of incubation. A linear least squares regression fit of the data points was performed, and the slope of each curve is given inparentheses. B, equal amounts of GST fusion proteins containing shorter Jun fragments (through residue 115 for the JunD isoforms and residue 79 for c-Jun) were used in kinase assays as in A. C, free JunD peptides, prepared by thrombin cleavage of GST-JunD fusion proteins, were used for an in vitro kinase assay. Equal amounts of peptides corresponding to the N termini of JunD-FL (amino acids 1–115; 0.15 μg) and to ΔJunD (amino acids 49–115; 0.09 μg) were incubated with equal amounts of JNK2α1 and [γ-32P]ATP for the indicated times. The reactions were quenched and separated by 17% SDS-PAGE, and the incorporated label was detected as in A. The longer peptide, JunD-FL (1–115), migrates anomalously faster than the shorter ΔJunD peptide. Each kinase assay was repeated at least three times with similar results. A single representative assay is shown for each set of substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 1, the GST moiety in the fusion proteins abuts a prospective JNK docking region in ΔJunD. To determine whether this structural arrangement interfered with efficient phosphorylation of the JunD substrate by JNK, free JunD peptides were prepared by cleaving the GST fusion constructs with thrombin. Equal amounts of free JunD peptides were then used in a kinase assay (Fig. 2C). The difference in the rate of phosphorylation between the JunD-FL and ΔJunD peptides was more pronounced than with the intact GST fusion proteins. When the free JunD peptide concentration was lowered in these assays (on a molar basis) compared with the amounts used in the GST-JunD kinase assays (Fig. 2, A and B) phosphorylation appeared to have neared saturation (Fig.2C). The larger amount of label in the JunD-FL peptide compared with the ΔJunD peptide suggested that it contained one or more JNK phosphorylation sites in addition to serine 90 and serine 100. Only one additional prospective JNK/MAP kinase target site (serine or threonine followed by a proline residue ((S/T)P)) was present in the JunD-FL peptide that was not contained in the ΔJunD peptide: threonine 3. Substitution of the threonine 3 residue with alanine had no effect on the rate or extent of phosphorylation of the JunD-FL peptide, indicating that threonine 3 is not a JNK target (data not shown). To further confirm that there were no additional JNK target sites within the first 48 amino acids of JunD, we compared phosphopeptide maps of the GST fusion proteins that were phosphorylated in vitro by JNK (Fig. 3B). The maps showed similar patterns for both isoforms of JunD, suggesting that they are phosphorylated on identical residues. Moreover, use of the S90A and/or S100A point mutations revealed the positions of the phosphopeptides containing the JNK target sites. Spot c in Fig.3B is generated from phosphorylation of serine 100, and spots a and b are generated from phosphorylation of serine 90. Lack of phosphorylation of the S90A/S100A double mutant indicated that Ser90 and Ser100 are the only sites that are phosphorylated within these N-terminal fragments (amino acids 1–115) in vitro. The longer GST-JunD fusion proteins (amino acids 1–149 for JunD-FL and 49–149 for ΔJunD) were also efficient JNK substrates (Fig.1A). However, when the S90A/S100A double mutation was introduced into the longer GST-JunD (1–149) construct, phosphorylation was not completely abolished. This result suggested the presence of additional JNK target site(s) between residues 116 and 149 (Fig.3C, lane 4). Sequence comparison between c-Jun and JunD in this region identified a likely JunD JNK target residue as threonine 117 (Fig. 3A). Thr117 is positioned in a cluster of amino acids (TTTPT) that is conserved between JunD and c-Jun and that fits the JNK/MAP kinase consensus. Mutation of threonine 117 to alanine in combination with the S90A and S100A mutations completely abolished phosphorylation of the GST-JunD (1–149) protein (Fig. 3C, lane 3), whereas the single T117A mutation reduced the level of phosphorylation (Fig.3C, lane 2). To test for direct interaction between JNKs and the two JunD isoforms, we used an in vitro GST pull-down assay (Fig. 4).In vitro35S-labeled JNKs were incubated with equimolar amounts of various GST-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione agarose beads. Following incubation the beads were harvested, washed extensively, then boiled directly in sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose, the35S-JNK present in the pellet was quantified using a PhosphorImager. Four of the 10 known JNK isoforms were tested (JNK1α1, JNK2α2, JNK2β2, and JNK3α1). All four JNK isoforms exhibited a similar pattern of binding affinities: c-Jun > JunB > JunD-FL > ΔJunD. The largest fold difference between JunD-FL and ΔJunD binding was for JNK3α1 (∼5-fold). A consensus sequence has been derived from sequence alignment of nine JNK-interacting proteins (44Yang S.H. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1740-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). A cluster of basic amino acids preceding two leucine residues separated by a single amino acid (LXL motif) has been found to be important functional components of the JNK docking domain (Fig.5A). Sequence analysis of the three Jun proteins revealed that this motif is conserved in each Jun protein (Fig. 5B). The LXL motif has been shown to be critical for the interaction of c-Jun with JNK (29Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Mutation of the LXL motif in c-Jun (A40/A42) resulted in an expected loss of JNK-mediated phosphorylation. Mutation of the corresponding residues in JunD-FL and ΔJunD (L57A/L59A) also resulted in the loss of JNK-mediated phosphorylation in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 5C). GST pull-down experiments using these constructs and 35S-labeled in vitro translated JNK2α1 revealed that LXL mutations in JunD abolished JNK binding (data not shown). The second important element in the JNK docking domain consensus sequence is the cluster of basic amino acids preceding the LXL motif. Both c-Jun and JunB contain a perfect consensus sequence and are high affinity substrates for JNKs. JunD deviates from the consensus at the first basic amino acid position (Fig. 5, A and B). We generated a M49K mutation in JunD to match the consensus sequence and a K32M mutation in c-Jun (as a reciprocal control) to determine whether the lack of the basic amino acid at the first position contributed to the observed lower affinity of JNKs for JunD. These mutations did not result in significant changes in the level of JNK binding or JNK-mediated phosphorylation usingin vitro assays (Fig. 5, D and E). Furthermore, a GST fusion protein containing a truncated N-terminal fragment of c-Jun (amino acids 32–79), which lacked the N-terminal sequences preceding"
https://openalex.org/W2083764314,"Androgens are essential for the differentiation, growth, and maintenance of male-specific organs. The effects of androgens in cells are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors. Recently, transient transfection studies have shown that overexpression of cell cycle regulatory proteins affects the transcriptional activity of the AR. In this report, we characterize the transcriptional activity of endogenous AR through the cell cycle. We demonstrate that in G0, AR enhances transcription from an integrated steroid-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus promoter and also from an integrated androgen-specific probasin promoter. This activity is strongly reduced or abolished at the G1/S boundary. In S phase, the receptor regains activity, indicating that there is a transient regulatory event that inactivates the AR at the G1/S transition. This regulation is specific for the AR, since the related glucocorticoid receptor is transcriptionally active at the G1/S boundary. Not all of the effects of androgens are blocked, however, since androgens retain the ability to increase AR protein levels. The transcriptional inactivity of the AR at the G1/S junction coincides with a decrease in AR protein level, although activity can be partly rescued without an increase in receptor. Inhibition of histone deacetylases brings about this partial restoration of AR activity at the G1/S boundary, demonstrating the involvement of acetylation pathways in the cell cycle regulation of AR transcriptional activity. Finally, a model is proposed that explains the inactivity of the AR at the G1/S transition by integrating receptor levels, the action of cell cycle regulators, and the contribution of histone acetyltransferase-containing coactivators.

In the adult, there is a continued requirement for androgens for the maintenance of some of these tissues (1Coffey D.S. Pienta K.J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1987; 239: 1-73PubMed Google Scholar). Androgen withdrawal leads, for instance, to increased apoptosis and regression of the prostate gland (2Koivisto P. Visakorpi T. Rantala I. Isola J. J. Pathol. 1997; 183: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This androgen dependence is retained in prostate cancer, where androgens are necessary for the onset and early development of the disease (3Culig Z. Hobisch A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Urol. Res. 2000; 28: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer, androgen ablation is the primary therapy used (4Trachtenberg J. Bruce A.W. Trachtenberg J. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1987: 173-184Crossref Google Scholar, 5Leewansangtong S. Soontrapa S. J. Med. Assoc. Thail. 1999; 82: 192-205PubMed Google Scholar), yet with time, androgen-independent tumors arise in individuals who undergo this therapy (6Scott W.W. Menon M. Walsh P.C. Cancer. 1980; 45: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Akakura K. Bruchovsky N. Goldenberg S.L. Rennie P.S. Buckley A.R. Sullivan L.D. Cancer. 1993; 71: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This has led to an intense investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in androgen signaling. The actions of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR),1 a transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. In the absence of androgens, the AR protein is primarily cytosolic and is found complexed with heat shock proteins that keep it inactive (8Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Upon binding to androgens, the receptor undergoes a conformational change that releases it from this inhibitory complex (9Ohara-Nemoto Y. Nemoto T. Sato N. Ota M. J Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). AR then localizes to the nucleus, where it binds as a dimer to androgen response elements found on the promoters of target genes (10Jenster G. Spencer T.E. Burcin M.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7879-7884Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The ability of the AR to modulate gene transcription is enhanced by the recruitment of coactivators and possibly by the release of corepressors (11Chen J.D. Li H. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1998; 8: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Collingwood T.N. Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 255-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Coactivators can provide enhanced interactions with the basal transcriptional machinery through activation domains of their own. They also contribute intrinsic or associated histone acetyltransferase activities, thus allowing for chromatin remodeling (13Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that activation of AR brings about such nucleosome rearrangements on the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter and that this remodeling correlates with transcriptional activity (14List H.J. Lozano C., Lu, J. Danielsen M. Wellstein A. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have also reported that the hyperacetylation of histones enhances the ability of the AR to remodel chromatin and modulate transcription (15List H.J. Smith C.L. Rodriguez O. Danielsen M. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that anti-androgens inhibit chromatin remodeling, consequently blocking AR transcriptional activity (16List H.J. Smith C.L. Martinez E. Harris V.K. Danielsen M. Riegel A.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the functions of AR require the activity of histone acetylases. The AR itself seems to also be the target of acetylation, and its transcriptional activity may be enhanced in vivo by this modification (17Fu M. Wang C. Reutens A.T. Wang J. Angeletti R.H.

The rate of mammalian cell growth is largely determined by the length of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Progression from G1 phase through the G1/S transition 2Throughout this paper, the terms “G1/S transition,” “G1/S boundary,” “G1/S junction,” and “G1/S” are used interchangeably. and into S phase is governed by the action of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) on the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (18DeCaprio J.A.

It is known that androgens influence growth, shortening the length of G1/G0 and accelerating entry into S phase, by affecting the expression and/or activity of cyclins and CDKs (3Culig Z. Hobisch A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Urol. Res. 2000; 28: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 26Gregory C.W. Johnson R.T., Jr. Presnell S.C. Mohler J.L. French F.S. J. Androl. 2001; 22: 537-548PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that some cell cycle regulatory proteins can, in turn, influence AR transcriptional activity by acting as AR coregulators. These include the retinoblastoma protein, and cyclins D1 and E, molecules that show altered expression in many human cancers. Our laboratory and others have reported that expression of the retinoblastoma protein restores AR function in Rb-deficient cells (27Lu J. Danielsen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31528-31533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,28Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Kang H. Ludlow J. Hsiao P. Wang C., Su, C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2297-2301PubMed Google Scholar) and Reutens et al. (30Reutens A.T., Fu, M. Wang C. Albanese C. McPhaul M.J. Sun Z. Balk S.P. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Pestell R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have shown that overexpression of cyclin D1 (and to a lesser extent cyclin D3) inhibits AR function in a CDK-independent manner. Furthermore, Yamamoto et al. (31Yamamoto A. Hashimoto Y. Kohri K. Ogata E. Kato S. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. J.

Generally, these experiments used transient transfection techniques to introduce into cells expression vectors of both the AR and the cell cycle regulator under study and measured transcriptional effects on transient templates (27Lu J.

This approach results in overexpression of the cell cycle regulators throughout the cell cycle rather than the phase-specific expression found in normal cells. We have taken a more physiological approach by investigation of the regulation of the transcriptional activity of endogenous AR on integrated promoters during the cell cycle. In this report, we show that the transcriptional activity of endogenous AR varies through the cell cycle. We demonstrate that the AR is transcriptionally active in G0, loses over 90% of its activity during the G1/S transition, and then regains the ability to enhance transcription in S phase. We show that this transient negative regulation at the G1/S transition is specific for the AR, since the related glucocorticoid receptor (GR) maintains transcriptional activity at this boundary. The down-regulation of AR protein that we observe at G1/S may partially explain the lack of transcriptional activity. However, chemical inhibition of histone deacetylases rescues AR activity during G1/S without increasing the level of AR protein, suggesting that regulation of AR activity during the cell cycle also involves acetylation/deacetylation pathways. L929 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3% calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the development of the L929-MMTVCAT stable cell line, L929 cells were transfected using Dosper liposomal reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with pMMTVCAT and pSV2neo (20:1 ratio), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To obtain the L929-ProbasinLuc cell line, L929 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) with p−286/+28PB-luciferase (32Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C.

In both cases, the cells were split 48 h after transfection and selected in growth media supplemented with 400 mg/liter G418 sulfate (Cellgro). Single clones were picked with sterile pipette tips and expanded. Clones were screened for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or luciferase activity after a 24-h hormone induction. Single clones showing low basal reporter activity and at least 5-fold activation with DHT were used for further studies (clones L929-MMTVCAT #31 and L929-ProbasinLuc 2.9 were used in this study). L929-MMTVCAT and L929-ProbasinLuc cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3% calf serum. All cell cycle arrests were carried out on ∼80% confluent cells (300,000 cells/well of a 24-well plate incubated overnight or the equivalent density on larger surface areas) according to the methods shown in Fig. 2A. After plating and overnight growth, cells were serum-starved (grown in 0.1% calf serum) for 48 h to induce entry into G0. (For control experiments, G0cells were exposed to 1 or 2 mm hydroxyurea for the second 24 h of starvation and during hormone induction as illustrated in Fig. 3B). During an additional 24 h of serum deprivation, cells were treated with steroids or left untreated. For G1/S arrests, cells were starved for 48 h as above. After this starvation, cells were exposed to 1 or 2 mmhydroxyurea in 10% serum for 24 h and for an additional 24 h in the presence or absence of hormone. Cells growing in serum were arrested along S phase by treatment with 1 or 2 mmhydroxyurea for 48 h. Cells were then induced with steroids for 24 h in the presence of hydroxyurea. In all cases, cells were washed with PBS after hormone treatment and harvested in 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 (when only CAT or luciferase assays were performed) or trypsinized and collected (when additional fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or Western analysis was to be performed). Collected cells were aliquoted, spun down, and resuspended. For CAT/luciferase assays, cells were resuspended in 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8; aliquots for FACS were resuspended in citrate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 40 mm trisodium citrate-2H2O, 5% Me2SO, pH 7.6), and cells for Western analysis were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (see below). All samples were stored frozen until analyzed. Citrate buffer samples were analyzed for DNA content at the Lombardi Cancer Center Flow Cytometry/Cell Sorting Shared Resource by propidium iodide staining in a FACSort (Becton Dickinson) (33Vindelov L.L. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1977; 24: 227-242PubMed Google Scholar). Computer modeling of cell cycle phase distribution was performed at this facility using the software package ModFit (Verity).FIG. 3Transcriptional activity of AR and GR in the presence of hydroxyurea in G0 and G1/S cells. A, G0-arrested L929-MMTVCAT cells were exposed for 48 h to hydroxyurea during serum starvation. CAT activity in response to 1 nm DHT or 100 nm DEX was then measured (left panel). Transcriptional activity was measured in extracts from G1/S-arrested cells after a 24-h induction with 1 nm DHT or 100 nmDEX (right panel). The same amount of protein was used in all CAT assays.

AR activity was not affected by the longer starvation treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell extracts in 0.25m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, were frozen/thawed three times to lyse the cells. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For CAT assays, equal amounts of protein from each extract (typically 1 or 2 μg) were combined with 1 μl of3H-labeled acetyl coenzyme A (1.33 Ci/mmol specific activity; DuPont), 19.0 μl of 2 mg/ml chloramphenicol, and 80 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. One ml of organic scintillation mixture Econoflour-2 (Packard Instrument Co.) was overlaid on the reaction mix, and vials were placed in a scintillation counter. As the reaction proceeds, the acetylated product is incorporated into the organic phase and is counted (35Zhang S.a.D., M. Lieberman B.A. Steroid Receptor Methods. 176. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 297-316Google Scholar). Samples were counted for three consecutive cycles in a β counter, and the results were expressed as the increase of the counts produced/min (cpm/min). For luciferase assays, equal amounts of protein from each extract were combined with 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega) and immediately counted in a luminometer. Cells were collected, spun, and washed in cold PBS. Cell pellets were dissolved in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.66 mg/ml Pefabloc (Invitrogen), 3.3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Typically, 30 μg of total protein was loaded in each lane of a 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and confirmed by Ponceau Red staining. After blocking for at least 2 h in 5% milk, 0.2% polyvinyl pyrrolidone, membranes were blotted with the corresponding first antibody. For AR detection, 4 μg/ml PA1-111A, a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the N terminus of the AR (Affinity Bioreagents) was used. A 1:200 dilution of sc-1616, a goat polyclonal antibody, was used to probe for actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using anti-rabbit or anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were quantified using the software package ImageQuant. Several reports over the past few years show the involvement of G0, G1/S, and S phase cell cycle regulators in the control of androgen receptor activity. Generally, these experiments used transient transfection techniques to introduce into cells expression vectors of both the AR and the cell cycle regulator under study and measured transcriptional effects on transient templates (27Lu J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 873-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although such studies provide important information on the interaction of cell cycle regulators and the AR, they do not distinguish between effects seen due purely to overexpression and those that reflect interactions that occur during normal cell growth. Our approach was to investigate the regulation of the transcriptional activity of endogenous AR on integrated promoters during the cell cycle. To do this, we developed a cell line with an integrated AR-responsive CAT reporter gene. L929 cells that express endogenous AR were stably transfected with the androgen- and glucocorticoid-responsive reporter pMMTVCAT. The resulting clones were expanded and characterized. A cell line was established from a representative clone and is referred to here as L929-MMTVCAT. The presence of functional AR in these cells is shown in Fig. 1A (left panel), where treatment with androgens (1 nmdihydrotestosterone (DHT)) resulted in over 30-fold induction of CAT activity. This transcriptional activity was fully blocked by the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate, demonstrating the involvement of the AR in this response. Since L929 cells are known to also express endogenous GR, we measured transcriptional activity in response to glucocorticoids. CAT activity was induced over 20-fold in the presence of dexamethasone (DEX). This induction of MMTVCAT was due to the action of the GR, since the antiglucocorticoid ZK 98.299 fully blocked the response (Fig. 1A, right panel). To optimize the androgen response for cell cycle studies, a time course of AR activation was performed in serum-starved L929-MMTVCAT cells. Androgens clearly induced measurable CAT activity after 24 h (Fig. 1B). This time point was used in cell cycle experiments, since we observed that cells lose synchrony during prolonged arrest (data not shown). To measure the transcriptional activity of the AR in G0, G1/S, or S phase, cells were arrested prior to receptor activation, and cell cycle blocks were maintained during hormone treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures” and outlined in Fig. 2A. To ensure effective cell cycle arrests throughout the length of the experiments, we performed FACS analysis on arrested cells both prior to (data not shown) and after hormone induction as well as on uninduced controls (Fig. 2, B–D, right panels). Importantly, we observed that 24-h androgen treatment had no discernible effect on cell cycle distribution (compare NH histograms with DHT histograms, in Fig. 2, for example). This was expected, since the growth of L929 cells is affected negatively by glucocorticoids and positively by androgens only under chronic long term exposure (36Jung-Testas I. Baulieu E.E. Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. 1985; 86: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, we found that unsynchronized cells growing in the presence of 3% serum routinely showed 20–30-fold induction of CAT activity in response to 1 nm DHT. AR consistently had the highest activity in serum-starved G0cells, inducing CAT activity up to 100-fold in the presence of DHT (Fig. 2B, left panel). In contrast, the AR showed no detectable activity after treatment with 1 nm DHT, in cells arrested at the G1/S boundary (Fig. 2C). AR regained transcriptional activity when the cells were released from G1/S arrest (not shown) or were blocked along S phase by direct treatment with hydroxyurea without prior serum starvation (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that there is a transient regulatory event that prevents AR transcriptional activity at the G1/S boundary. The anti-androgen cyproterone acetate inhibited DHT-induced activity in G0cells and did not show any agonistic activity in cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary (data not shown). As seen in Table I, in three independent experiments, the transcriptional activity of the AR at the G1/S junction was decreased 92–100% compared with its activity in G0. This shows that at the G1/S transition AR function is strongly and consistently inhibited.Table IAR transcriptional activityExperimentG0 activityG1/S activityDecreasecpm/mincpm/min%145Undetectable∼1002751.6983342.792 Open table in a new tab To ensure that the inactivity of the AR in cells arrested at the G1/S transition was not the result of nonspecific actions of the arresting drug, we tested the effects of hydroxyurea on AR activity during G0. L929-MMTVCAT cells were prearrested in G0 by serum starvation for 24 h. During the next 24 h, the cells were exposed to 2 mm hydroxyurea with continued serum starvation. In the final 24 h of treatment, cells were induced with androgens during continued exposure to hydroxyurea and serum starvation (Fig.3B). AR transcriptional activity in G0 cells was unaffected by the presence of hydroxyurea, giving androgen inductions within the range usually obtained with cells in this phase of the cell cycle (Fig.3A, left panel). These data demonstrate that the loss of AR function observed at G1/S is not a nonspecific or toxic effect of the drug per se. Indeed, a similar lack of AR inhibition by hydroxyurea is seen in cells arrested along S phase with this drug (Fig. 2D). To test whether the prolonged treatment of G1/S cells (96 h compared with 72 h for G0 and S phase cells; see Fig.2A) could account for the inactivity of the AR, cells were serum-starved for 72 h and then exposed to hormone during an additional 24 h of starvation. As can be seen in Fig.3D, the transcriptional activity of the AR was unaffected by the 96-h starvation treatment. Indeed, we have prolonged starvation for an additional 24 h as well as performed 72-h hydroxyurea treatments in serum with no effects on AR activity (not shown). To test whether there was a general shut down of transcription or translation at the G1/S boundary or whether this regulation was specific to the androgen pathway, we arrested cells at the G1/S boundary and then treated them with either glucocorticoids or androgens. Treatment of cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary with 100 nm DEX or 1 nm DHT for 24 h did not alter their distribution along the cell cycle (Fig.3C). GR was transcriptionally active in cells arrested at the G1/S transition, inducing CAT activity over 20-fold, yet no AR activity was detected in androgen-treated cells in the same experiment (Fig. 3A, right panel). These data show that there is a preferential negative regulation of the AR over the GR at the G1/S transition. They also demonstrate that there is not an inherent deficiency in the transcription or the translation of the CAT message or protein, respectively, in G1/S boundary-arrested cells, since glucocorticoid treatment results in CAT activity. The MMTV long terminal repeat is a promiscuous promoter that not only responds to androgens and glucocorticoids but also to mineralocorticoids and progestins (37Ham J. Thomson A. Needham M. Webb P. Parker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5263-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 38Beato M. Chalepakis G. Schauer M. Slater E.P. J.

To evaluate whether a similar temporal regulation of AR is observed on promoters that respond only to the AR, we obtained"

We demonstrate here that this phosphatase also participates in the regulation of cell spreading and migration, pointing to its involvement in cytoskeleton organization. Low M r phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase-overexpressing fibroblasts are, indeed, less spread than controls and display a significantly decreased number of focal adhesions and increased cell motility. Furthermore, p125 focal adhesion kinase is associated to, and dephosphorylated by, lowM r phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase bothin vitro and in vivo. This event is consistent with an altered association of pp60src with focal adhesion kinase. The activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, another well known event downstream of the focal adhesion kinase, is also affected. On the other hand, cells overexpressing the dominant-negative form of low M rphosphotyrosine protein phosphatase exhibit hyperphosphorylated focal adhesion kinase, reduced motility, and an increased number of focal adhesions, which are distributed all over the ventral cell surface. Taken together, the results reported here are in keeping with low M r phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase participation in FAK-mediated focal adhesion remodeling."

Other analyses using a mammalian cell-free translation-translocation system indicate that pro-proteins bind Gaa1 in the absence of Gpi8 but that binding of pro-proteins to Gpi8 does not occur in the absence of Gaa1. 2R. Chen and M. E. Medof, submitted for publication.2R. Chen and M. E. Medof, submitted for publication. Although these studies are suggestive, it is difficult to take them further to analyze the physical and functional architecture of GPIT and determine the role of its various constituent subunits. In an attempt to dissect the GPIT complex from a structure-function perspective, we opted to analyze human Gaa1. Gaa1 is the most conspicuously hydrophobic of the known subunits of GPIT, and the results described above suggest that it may play a key role in substrate recognition. It is predicted to be a multispanning membrane protein of ∼67 kDa with seven transmembrane (TM) domains, a large lumenal domain between the first two TM segments, and a cytoplasmically oriented N terminus bearing a potential ER retrieval signal in the form of a di-arginine motif (24Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The TM domains may play a role in recognizing the hydrophobic component of the GPI signal sequence in pro-proteins, whereas the lumenal domain may mediate the association of Gaa1 with the other GPIT subunits and possibly also GPI. Furthermore, the potential ER retrieval signal in Gaa1 may serve to localize the entire human GPIT complex to the ER because no known ER retention/retrieval motifs are evident in any of the other subunits of mammalian GPIT. To explore these possibilities, we created a series of epitope tagged C-terminal deletion variants of human Gaa1, expressed them in mammalian cells, and used them to analyze the role of Gaa1 in GPIT. Our results provide a clear functional delineation of the different sequence domains of Gaa1. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin-streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Goat serum was purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and DNA polymerase were purchased from MBI Fermentas and New England Biolabs. All of the other chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification. Anti-Gpi8 and anti-Gaa1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against Escherichia coli-expressed polypeptides corresponding to residues 31–322 of human Gpi8 and residues 60–205 of human Gaa1, respectively. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the FLAG epitope (an 8-amino acid sequence consisting of DYKDDDDK), the V5 epitope (a 14-amino acid sequence consisting of GKPIPNPLLGLDST), and human calnexin were purchased from Sigma, Invitrogen, and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgGs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). N-terminally FLAG-tagged human Gaa1 cDNA subcloned into the pME18Sf vector (17Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1523-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was used as a template to generate Gaa1 truncation mutants by PCR (see Figs. 3A and 8Afor schematic figures of the mutants). For the production of constructs D1–D7, primers were designed so that the sense strand primer TR9 included an EcoRI site at the 5′ end for subcloning, and the antisense primers D1–D7 included nontemplated sequences encoding the His6 epitope tag, a stop codon, and an XbaI restriction site at the 3′ end. After EcoRI and XbaI digestion, the PCR products were ligated toEcoRI/XbaI-digested pME18Sf vector. The resulting plasmids were named pME/D1–7. The Gaa1 open reading frame encompasses codons 1–621 (D1), 564 (D2), 524 (D3), 483 (D4), 446 (D5), 386 (D6), and 367 (D7). To generate Gaa1 constructs bearing a V5 epitope tag C-terminal to the His6 sequence, sense GN5 and antisense GAV5 primers with BamHI and XbaI sites, respectively, were used for PCR amplification of Gaa1 cDNA from pME18Sf/Gaa1. The PCR product was digested withBamHI/XbaI and ligated into aBamHI/XbaI pEF6/V5 His vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was named pEF/D1V5. The D10, D11, and D12 constructs were made by PCR using the sense strand primer D10 containing a SalI site and antisense primers D6, D7, and D1, respectively. PCR-amplified products were digested withSalI/XbaI and ligated toSalI/XbaI-digested pME18Sf/Gaa1 vector. In the resulting constructs 18 residues at the N terminus of Gaa1 were replaced with Met-FLAG tag epitope, followed by a 3-amino acid (Val-Asp-Arg) linker to the first TM segment.FIG. 8Analyses of Gaa1 variants lacking the cytoplasmically oriented N-terminal region.

C, GAA1-deficient CHO cells transfected with an empty vector or the Gaa1 construct D12 were analyzed 2 days after transfection for surface expression of GPI-anchored CD59 by flow cytometry. Expression of D12 was monitored by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies as in Fig. 7. The band marked with anasterisk is nonspecific.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All substitutions of amino acid codons to Ala within the Gaa1 coding region in constructs pME/D24 (amino acids in positions 241–244 substituted with Ala residues) and pME/D35 (positions 354–358 substituted with Ala residues) were introduced by the primer-mediated mutagenesis method (25Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. Recombinant PCR: PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). In both cases, pME/D1 was used as the amplification template. PCR products with substitution mutations were digested by EcoRI/XbaI and subcloned intoEcoRI/XbaI-digested pME18Sf vector. To replace the N-terminal portion of α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) with the N-terminal cytoplasmic portion of Gaa1, a PCR fragment was generated from pME18Sf/Gaa1 vector using primers GN5 and GN3. The PCR product thus obtained was digested withBamHI/EcoRI and ligated intoBamHI/EcoRI Iip33-ST-V5-pcDNA 3.1 (a gift from Dr. Karen Colley, University of Illinois). The resulting N19-ST construct includes 19 N-terminal residues of human Gaa1, followed by Glu and Phe, and then the ST transmembrane region, stem region, and catalytic domain, fused with V5 epitope and His6sequence. HeLa cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The cells were passaged every 3–4 days. Exponentially growing cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed once with cytomix buffer (26van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The cells were subsequently resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in the same buffer, and 400 μl of suspension were transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette (Invitrogen) on ice. 50 μg of plasmid DNA was added to the suspension in the cuvette and mixed well. The mixture was then exposed to a single electric pulse of 300 V with a capacitance of 1,000 microfarads using an Invitrogen gene pulser system. The cuvette was immediately placed on ice for 10 min, and the cells were then suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated onto 100-mm plates. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h prior to harvesting for biochemical analyses and/or indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Transfected HeLa cells (1–2 × 107 cells) were harvested by scraping 48 h post-transfection, washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of MSB buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin or 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA)), and solubilized on ice for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C). S10 supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. To each supernatant fraction, 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) slurry was added, and the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 4 h with gentle agitation. The agarose beads were pelleted by 15 s of centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The samples were washed four times for 5 min each time in 1.5 ml of buffer MSB with 10 mm dithiothreitol. Bound antigen was released from the anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads by incubation with FLAG peptide (200 μg/ml) in MSB buffer. Immunoprecipitated fractions were subjected to centrifugation on a sucrose gradient or directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting using chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Sucrose gradients (4 ml) were centrifuged at 4 °C for 18 h at 192,000 × g, using a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Following centrifugation, the gradients were fractionated into 350-μl aliquots, and the proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Gradient performance and resolution were evaluated by analyzing standard proteins: bovine serum albumin (65 kDa, 4.2 S), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa, 7.6 S), catalase (250 kDa, 11 S), and ferritin (460 kDa, 17.7 S). The standard proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining. Transiently transfected HeLa cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After three more washes with PBS, the plasma membrane was selectively permeabilized with digitonin at 3 μg/ml in cytomix buffer with 0.3 m sucrose for 5 min on ice. Alternatively, plasma membranes as well as intracellular membranes were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After permeabilization, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 10% goat serum albumin in PBS for 60 min at room temperature to block nonspecific binding. The cells were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml, anti-V5 monoclonal antibody at 1:500 dilution, or anti-calnexin monoclonal antibody at 1:1000 dilution, after which they were washed three times with PBS. Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution) was then added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with PBS at room temperature, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides (a drop of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was included during mounting of the coverslip to prevent rapid photobleaching of the fluorescent conjugates) and taken for confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad confocal microscope (type MRC 1000) with optical section chosen at 0.2 μm/section. In vitro translation reactions were performed using TNT Quick Coupled Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) from New England Biolabs was used for carbohydrate digestion. The protein samples were denatured by the addition of 0.1 volume of 10× Endo H denaturation buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol), followed by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. Then 0.1 volume of 10× Endo H reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, at 25 °C) was added to the denatured sample, followed by incubation with 1 μl of 4,000 units/μl Endo H for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to monitor molecular mass reductions accompanying deglycosylation. Mouse GAA1 knockout F9 cells (1 × 107) (17Ohishi K. Inoue N. Maeda Y. Takeda J. Riezman H.

Two days after electroporation, the cells were stained with biotinylated anti-Thy-1 G7 antibody followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). GAA1-deficient CHO D9PA91 cells (1 × 107) (27Abrami L. Fivaz M. Kobayashi T. Kinoshita T. Parton R.G. van der Goot F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30729-30736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were electroporated with 25 μg each of plasmids at 960 microfarads and 280V. Two days after the transfection, the cells were harvested, one-thirtieth of the sample was used for flow cytometric analysis, and the rest of the sample was used for immunoblotting. For cytometric analysis the cells were stained with biotinylated anti-CD59 5H8 antibody followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda) and analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). For immunoblotting analysis the cells were solubilized in 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. The lysates obtained by centrifugation of the cells at 18,000 ×g for 20 min were incubated with 10 μl of M2 anti-FLAG beads overnight. The precipitates were washed five times with the same buffer without protease inhibitors, heated with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting using biotinylated M2 anti-FLAG antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using polyacrylamide slab gels made according to the method of Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). Protein sequence analysis was performed at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (golgi.harvard.edu/microchem/) by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnegan LCQ DECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The predicted molecular mass of a stoichiometric complex of the four known components of GPIT is ∼240 kDa. To assess the size of the native GPIT complex directly, a digitonin extract of HeLa cell microsomes was analyzed by velocity sedimentation on a 5–30% sucrose gradient. Immunoblotting of the gradient fractions with anti-Gpi8 and anti-Gaa1 antibodies (Fig. 1A) showed a fast-sedimenting pattern centered roughly around the ∼17.7 S (∼460 kDa) apo-ferritin standard. A similar analysis of a denaturing SDS extract showed Gpi8 sedimenting at ∼4 S, consistent with its ∼45-kDa monomeric size. These data indicate that GPIT sediments as a ∼17 S complex, larger than expected for a globular protein complex of ∼240 kDa. Our results are consistent with recent blue native gel electrophoresis analyses in which yeast Gpi8p was found within high molecular mass complexes in the 430–650-kDa range (15Fraering P. Imhof I. Meyer U. Strub J.M. van Dorsselaer A. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3295-3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The large sedimentation coefficient of the digitonin-extracted GPIT complex may be attributed to a nonglobular shape, bound detergent, the presence of multiple copies of one or more of the known subunits, the presence of additional, hitherto unidentified subunits, and/or interaction with other cellular components (29Tanford C. Nozaki Y. Reynolds J.A. Makino S. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We investigated the latter possibilities by expressing FLAG-tagged human Gaa1 in HeLa cells and using anti-FLAG antibodies to immunoprecipitate FLAG-Gaa1 complexes from a digitonin or Nonidet P-40 extract of the cells. Cells transfected with an empty vector were used to assess the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Fig. 1B shows that PIG-S, PIG-T, Gpi8, and α- and β-tubulin are all co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Gaa1. The presence of the tubulin isoforms as well as PIG-S and PIG-T was confirmed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic peptides. The presence of tubulin in the immunoprecipitates is discussed below. Several other protein bands were also seen in the FLAG-Gaa1 immunoprecipitate, but these were deemed to be nonspecific because they were either found in control immunoprecipitates or seen to sediment separately from the immunoprecipitated GPIT complex on sucrose velocity gradients (see below). The lower intensity of bands corresponding to PIG-S, PIG-T, and Gpi8 compared with Gaa1 (Fig. 1B) is most likely due to the fact that FLAG-Gaa1 is overexpressed, and not all copies of the protein are integrated into GPIT complexes (see Fig. 4 and accompanying text). Other possible explanations are that the complex is not a stoichiometric combination of the four known subunits or that the subunits are not equally well stained with silver. As a prelude to our mutagenesis study of Gaa1, we carried out experiments to verify the ER localization and membrane topology of the protein. Based upon predictive algorithms, Gaa1 is presumed to be an integral membrane protein with 7 TM domains and a large loop between the first and second TM segments. The N terminus of the protein is predicted to be oriented toward the cytoplasm, whereas the C terminus is expected to be oriented toward the ER lumen. Gaa1 constructs containing either an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag or a C-terminal V5 epitope tag were expressed in HeLa cells. Both expressed constructs displayed a reticular distribution pattern characteristic of the ER. The cells were fixed, treated with digitonin to permeabilize the plasma membrane or Triton X-100 to permeabilize all membranes, and labeled with antibodies to the FLAG or V5 epitope tags. As shown in Fig. 2, digitonin-permeabilized cells could be labeled with anti-FLAG antibodies, confirming the cytoplasmic orientation of the Gaa1 N terminus. In contrast, the V5 epitope tag could be labeled only after Triton X-100 permeabilization, implying that the Gaa1 C terminus is sequestered in the lumen of the ER. These data, together with evidence that an asparagine residue within a glycosylation sequon in the loop region of Gaa1 is N-glycosylated (data not shown, but see corresponding data for truncated Gaa1 variants below), indicate that the predicted topology of the protein is correct. To identify structural features of Gaa1 required for its interaction with the other known components of GPIT, we created a series of N-terminally FLAG-tagged truncation mutants (Fig.3A) in which we systematically removed six of the seven predicted membrane-spanning segments from the C terminus of Gaa1. These constructs (termed D2–D7), as well as similarly tagged full-length Gaa1 (termed D1), were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. The cells were extracted with Nonidet P-40, and the detergent extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads to immunoprecipitate the Gaa1 constructs and any associated proteins. Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies indicated that all constructs were well expressed, with the possible exception of D2 and D5, which were expressed at lower levels compared with D1 (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Immunoblotting with anti-Gpi8 antibodies indicated that Gpi8 was immunoprecipitated with all of the Gaa1 constructs except D7, a construct representing only the first N-terminal TM d"
https://openalex.org/W1989723488,"Serine phosphorylation of the ShcA signaling molecule has been reported recently. In this work, we have identified 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- and growth factor-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in p52Shc and p66Shc. Among them, Ser29 in p52Shc (equivalent to Ser138 in p66Shc) was phosphorylated only after TPA stimulation. Phosphorylation of this site together with the intact phosphotyrosine-binding domain was essential for ShcA binding to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. TPA-induced ShcA phosphorylation at this site (and hence, its association with PTP-PEST) was inhibited by a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor and was induced by overexpression of constitutively active mutants of protein kinase Cα, -ε, and -δ isoforms. Insulin also induced ShcA/PTP-PEST association, although to a lesser extent than TPA. Overexpression of a PTP-PEST binding-defective mutant of p52Shc (S29A) enhanced insulin-induced ERK activation in insulin receptor-overexpressing HIRc-B cells. Consistent with this, p52Shc S29A was more tyrosine-phosphorylated than wild-type p52Shc after insulin stimulation. Thus, we have identified a new mechanism whereby serine phosphorylation of ShcA controls the ability of its phosphotyrosine-binding domain to bind PTP-PEST, which is responsible for the dephosphorylation and down-regulation of ShcA after insulin stimulation.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). One of the pathways controlled by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway that converts the receptor signals into a variety of outputs (1Hunter T.

In contrast, it has been suggested that the TPA-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of p52Shc/p66Shc is involved in ERK activation because it leads to an increase in ShcA/Grb2 association without an increase in ShcA tyrosine phosphorylation (19El-Shemerly M.Y.

Similarly, a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent increase in Shc/Grb2 association after TPA treatment in MCF7 cells has been attributed to ERK activation (23Sato H. Ogata H. De Luca L.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2904-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Finally, Migliaccio et al. (20Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sites involved in the association of p52ShcA/p66ShcA and PTP-PEST were mapped to the PTB domain in ShcA and an NPLH sequence in the carboxyl terminus of PTP-PEST (25Charest A. Wagner J. Jacob S. McGlade C.J. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8424-8429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This was the first report showing phosphotyrosine-independent binding of the PTB domain of ShcA to a target protein. Murine PTP-PEST is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic phosphatase of 112 kDa characterized by the presence of a so-called PEST sequence that is thought to confer protein stability (26Charest A. Wagner J. Shen S.H. Tremblay M.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST is phosphorylated by PKC and protein kinase A at Ser39 and Ser435, and this serine phosphorylation down-regulates its activity (27Garton A.J. Tonks N.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3763-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Association with other proteins (28Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) may also control the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, and ShcA has been suggested to recruit PTP-PEST to its substrates for dephosphorylation (24Habib T. Herrera R. Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25243-25246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PTP-PEST has been shown recently to associate with and dephosphorylate ShcA in B cells, contributing to negative regulation of lymphocyte activation via inactivation of the Ras pathway (29Davidson D. Veillette A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3414-3426Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Activated insulin receptor phosphorylates various cellular substrates at tyrosine residues (30White M.F.

One of these phosphorylation sites has been characterized and shown to be involved in binding to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP-PEST. Phosphorylation of this site was induced by overexpression of some constitutively active isoforms of PKC, but not by others. Furthermore, binding of PTP-PEST to Shc down-regulated insulin-induced ERK activation. We have shown also that TPA-induced ERK activation does not involve serine phosphorylation of Shc in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Protein phosphorylation, a key component in the regulation of signaling pathways controlling many fundamental physiological processes, is determined not only by protein kinases, but also by protein phosphatases (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). One of the pathways controlled by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 pathway that converts the receptor signals into a variety of outputs (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar, 2Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). Shc adapter/docking proteins are an important component of this pathway because they are involved in transducing the activation signals from receptor or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases to downstream signaling cascades (3Pelicci G.

Telford J.L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1141-1147PubMed Google Scholar). At least three genes, shcA, shcB, and shcC, are known to encode Shc proteins. These share an amino-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, a central proline/glycine-rich region (CH1), and a carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain (6Nakamura T. Sanokawa R.

ShcA exists in three isoforms in mammalian cells, p46, p52, and p66, which differ only in the extent of their amino-terminal sequence and are produced through alternative splicing and differential use of translation initiation sites (10Luzi L. Confalonieri S., Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ShcA has two modules of phosphotyrosine recognition with different specificities, an amino-terminal PTB domain and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (11van der Geer P. Wiley S. Lai V.K. Olivier J.P.

Thus, it can associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins such as receptor tyrosine kinases and cytoplasmic proteins (e.g. SHIP2) (12Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). ShcA has been found to be phosphorylated rapidly and efficiently by all tyrosine kinases tested to date (10Luzi L. Confalonieri S., Di Fiore P.P. Pelicci P.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

J., Stein, V., Weinreich, F., and Zdebik, A. A. (2002) Physiol. Rev. 82, 503–568). Regulation of ClC activity is, therefore, of widespread biological significance (Forgac, M. (1999) J. Biol.

We now ascribe just such a regulatory function to the increases in cellular levels of inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4) that inevitably accompany activation of the ubiquitous Ins(1,4,5)P3 signaling pathway. We used confocal imaging to record insulin granule acidification in single mouse pancreatic β-cells. Granule acidification was reduced by perfusion of single cells with 10 μmIns(3,4,5,6)P4 (the concentration following receptor activation), whereas at 1 μm (“resting” levels), Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was ineffective. This response to Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was not mimicked by 100 μmIns(1,4,5,6)P4 or by 100 μmIns(1,3,4,5,6)P5. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 did not affect granular H+-ATPase activity or H+ leak, indicating that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 instead inhibited charge neutralization by ClC. The Ins(3,4,5,6)P4-mediated inhibition of vesicle acidification reduced exocytic release of insulin as determined by whole-cell capacitance recordings. This may impinge upon type 2 diabetes etiology. Regulatory control over vesicle acidification by this negative signaling pathway in other cell types should be considered.

This has raised the question as to whether, in other cell types, there can be wider biological significance to receptor-dependent changes in Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels. There are Cl− channels, which are different from CLCAs, that are expressed in intracellular vesicles, such as endosomes (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), synaptosomes (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar), and insulin granules in β-cells (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where they co-localize with H+-ATPases (10Jentsch T.J. Friedrich T. Schriever A. Yamada H. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 437: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 11Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bösl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R.

Biol. 1992; 172: 245-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acidification of the vesicular interior by these H+-ATPases serves a number of important functions, including modulation of certain ligand-protein interactions during endocytosis, enzyme targeting, coupled transport of small molecules, and optimization of proteolytic activities of, for example, prohormone processing enzymes (13Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 27Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that luminal acidification drives the priming of insulin granules so that they become competent to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their cargo (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This particular paradigm could be more widely applicable to endocrine and neurotransmitter release. If the vesicle acidification driven by the electrogenic H+-ATPase were not to be charge-compensated, a large transmembrane electrical gradient would develop, and this would then prevent further H+ pumping even before a substantial acidification of the vesicular interior could take place (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 12Al-Awqati Q. Barasch J. Landry D. J. Exp.

Cl− flux into the vesicles provides the electrical neutralization that is necessary to prevent an inhibitory electrochemical gradient from forming (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 12Al-Awqati Q. Barasch J. Landry D. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 245-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The molecular nature of the channels that are responsible for this Cl− flux has been ascertained; they are members of the ClC family (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J.

Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Unlike CLCAs, the intracellular ClC channels are not generally considered to be Ca2+-activated (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Indeed the ClC channels show no sequence homology with any of the Ins(3,4,5,6)P4-sensitive CLCAs that have been cloned (5Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Zhang H. McCarthy M. Barrett K.E. Yankaskas J.R. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. Pediatr. Pulm. Suppl. 2001; 21: A88Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we have now investigated whether there is a functionally significant interaction of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 with ClC channels; our model system has been mouse β-cell insulin granules, which were recently ascertained to contain ClC3 (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results that we have obtained expand the biological significance of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. The inositol phosphates used in this study were all purchased from CellSignals Inc. (Lexington, KY). Insulin granule pH was monitored by combining the patch-clamp technique with confocal imaging. Pancreatic β-cells, isolated and cultured on glass coverslips for 2–24 h, were voltage-clamped at −70 mV as described previously (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LysoSensor-GreenTM DND-189 (1 μm, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) was added during the last 30 min of cell culture and was also included in the extracellular buffer (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that continuously perfused the experimental chamber. All LSG experiments were performed at 20 °C to prevent exocytosis that otherwise interfered with the optical measurements (15Renström E. Eliasson L. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 41-52Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). LSG fluorescence was excited using the 488 nm line of a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. The emitted light was collected with a 63×/1.3 NA oil objective and a >505 nm filter. Laser scanning was performed with low pixel resolution (128 × 128) and with 6-s intervals to minimize photobleaching. After gigaseal formation, it was ascertained that LSG fluorescence was stable for at least 30 s before the experiment commenced. The intracellular electrode solution contained 125 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 3 mm MgATP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 10 mm EGTA, and 7 mm CaCl2 (∼0.4 μm free [Ca2+]i, pH 7.2 with KOH). In some experiments, marked “no calcium,” there was no added Ca2+, and the concentration of EGTA was 50 μm. Whole-cell capacitance measurements (at 33 °C) were made with the cells clamped at −70 mV, and the standard whole-cell configuration was established at t = 0. Capacitance recordings were made using an EPC-7 patch-clamp amplifier equipped with the software Pulse (Version 8.4 and later) and the X-chart extension (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany) (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since insulin granules comprise the major acidic compartment in murine β-cells, LSG fluorescence, measured by confocal imaging, was used to monitor changes in intragranular pH (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately after “intracellular” medium was perfused into a single cell through a patch-clamp pipette (Fig.1A, Control trace), a progressive increase in fluorescence intensity was observed, reflecting an increased acidification of the granule interior. As indicated in the Introduction, granule acidification requires charge compensation through the action of an active Cl−conductance. This is verified by the demonstration that acidification was inhibited either by a generic Cl− channel blocker, DIDS (Fig. 1B), by lowering the cytoplasmic Cl−concentration (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or by perfusing the cells with functionally inactivating anti-ClC3 antibodies (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next Ins(3,4,5,6)P4was perfused into the cell at a concentration (10 μm) typically attained after several minutes of receptor activation of phospholipase C (6Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 reduced by ∼65% the rate of acidification of the granular interior (Fig. 1,A and B). This is a specific effect; neither 100 μm Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 nor 100 μmIns(1,3,4,5,6)P5 affected vesicle acidification (Fig.1B). A concentration of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4equivalent to that in resting cells (1 μm) was ineffective (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating thatin vivo this new role for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is dependent upon stimulus-mediated increases in its concentration. Another approach to studying the relevance of ClC channels to transmembrane H+ movements is to discharge the H+ gradient across the membrane of the insulin granule with the protonophore CCCP (Fig. 2). Protonophonic H+ flux is electrogenic such that collapse of the transmembrane pH gradient requires operation of the Cl− channel charge shunt (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, loss of H+from the granules is inhibited upon blockade of the Cl−conductance by DIDS (Fig. 2B and Ref. 9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A quantitatively similar inhibitory effect upon CCCP-induced H+ flux was observed when the cells were perfused with 10 μmIns(3,4,5,6)P4 (Fig. 2). Note that, in these experiments, the intracellular medium contained ATP to support continued operation of the H+-ATPase. If Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 had inhibited the H+-ATPase, the polyphosphate would have been expected to accelerate the rate of dissipation of the pH gradient; this is the opposite of the result that was actually obtained. Equally, the failure of the H+ gradient to discharge in the presence of 10 μm Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (Fig. 2) indicates that the polyphosphate did not increase granule H+ leak. We therefore conclude that Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibits vesicle acidification (Fig. 1) by regulating the granule Cl− conductance. In control experiments, we added 100 μm Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and this had no effect on the rate at which CCCP promoted H+ efflux out of the granule (Fig. 2). Resting levels of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4(1 μm) also failed to affect CCCP-induced collapse of the pH gradient (Fig. 2). The degree of insulin granule acidification in pancreatic β-cells has been proposed to affect their fusogenic potential, thereby influencing the rate of insulin secretion by exocytosis (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Barg S. Renström E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A. Bokvist K. Braun M. Eliasson L. Holmes W.E. Köhler M. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 96: 5539-5544Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore we next investigated whether the interaction of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 with insulin granule Cl− channels affected exocytosis, which we recorded by monitoring capacitance of β-cells with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique (16Barg S. Renström E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A. Bokvist K. Braun M. Eliasson L. Holmes W.E. Köhler M. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 96: 5539-5544Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). When the cell was perfused with an intracellular medium containing 0.4 μm[Ca2+]free (i.e. the cytosolic [Ca2+] attained after glucose levels are elevated, Ref.17Jonas J.-C. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273PubMed Google Scholar), a progressive increase in cell capacitance was observed, reflecting Ca2+-dependent activation of granule exocytosis (Fig. 3A). Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (10 μm) inhibited exocytosis by ∼50% (Fig. 3, A and B). Since 1 μm Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was ineffective (Fig. 3,A and B), inhibition of exocytosis by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 in vivo can be anticipated to be stimulus-dependent. Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (100 μm) had no effect upon exocytosis (Fig. 3, Aand B). When cells were perfused with intracellular medium containing 1.5 μm [Ca2+]free, the rate of exocytosis was about 2-fold faster than was obtained with 0.4 μm [Ca2+]free (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in this condition, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 did not affect the rate of exocytosis (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, large intracellular Ca2+ transients offer an opportunity for dynamic bypass of the inhibition of exocytosis by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. Exocytosis that is stimulated by smaller Ca2+ transients (<0.4 μm), such as those elicited by glucose (17Jonas J.-C. Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1266-1273PubMed Google Scholar), would be more sensitive to inhibition by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 according to our data (Fig. 3, Aand B). Prior to this report, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was only known to be physiologically active as an inhibitor of salt and fluid secretion from epithelial cells (6Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A. Shears S.B. Tsien R.Y. Barrett K.E. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Nature. 1994; 371: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 7Carew M.A. Yang X. Schultz C. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26906-26913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through modulation of at least some members of the CLCA family (3Ho M.W.Y. Kaetzel M.A. Armstrong D.L. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18673-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G.

Pediatr. Pulm. Suppl. 2001; 21: A88Google Scholar). Yet stimulus-dependent, Ins(1,4,5)P3-coupled increases in Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 levels are a ubiquitous phenomenon (2Menniti F.S. Oliver K.G. Putney J.W., Jr. Shears S.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 53-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Now we have increased our understanding of the biological significance of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 by showing that it also regulates insulin granule acidification. We conclude that charge neutralization by ClC3 (the species of ClC in insulin granules, Ref. 9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is the target of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 action. It is possible that future experiments will further expand the signaling repertoire of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4; ClC3 is highly conserved and widely expressed, important to endocytosis, especially in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, and also necessary for development of the retina and hippocampus (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 11Stobrawa S.M. Breiderhoff T. Takamori S. Engel D. Schweizer M. Zdebik A.A. Bösl M.R. Ruether K. Jahn H. Draguhn A. Jahn R. Jentsch T.J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Equally, the ClC channel on insulin granules must now be considered a regulated signaling entity rather than being subservient to vesicle acidification. Our work also confirms and extends the hypothesis (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Barg S. Renström E. Berggren P.-O. Bertorello A. Bokvist K. Braun M. Eliasson L. Holmes W.E. Köhler M. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 96: 5539-5544Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that the degree of insulin granule acidity is a decisive factor in the regulation of exocytosis. The new action of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 that we describe in the current study differs in one important aspect from its ability to inhibit epithelial salt and fluid secretion, which Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 achieves by preventing Cl−conductance through CLCAs from being activated by either calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (3Ho M.W.Y. Kaetzel M.A. Armstrong D.L. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18673-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Xie W. Kaetzel M.A. Bruzik K.S. Dedman J.R. Shears S.B. Nelson D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14092-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or by Ca2+ itself (5Ismailov I.I. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Barrett K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10505-10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast the ClC3 Cl−channels present on insulin granules (9Barg S. Huang P. Eliasson L. Nelson D.J. Obermüller S. Rorsman P. Thévenod F. Renström E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are not generally considered to be activated by Ca2+ (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Indeed, lowering the [Ca2+]free from 0.4 μm to below 0.1 μm had no impact upon granule acidification (Figs. 1and 2). Treatment of the cells with W-7, a calmodulin antagonist, was similarly without effect (data not shown). Thus, Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibits granule acidification by a mechanism that does not depend upon Ca2+ signaling. New perspectives to β-cell research arise from our discovery that inhibition of granule acidification by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 is associated with down-regulation of insulin secretion. For example, it has not previously been considered that an inositol phosphate signaling process downstream of Ins(1,4,5)P3 might have an inhibitory influence upon insulin granule exocytosis. Nevertheless, sustained up-regulation of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 signaling pathway has previously been shown to have a deleterious effect upon insulin secretion (19Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. Kelley G.G. Pflueg. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1996; 432: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Ishihara H. Wada T. Kizuki N. Asano T. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our new results indicate that it is Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 that mediates the negative effect of inositol phosphate signaling upon insulin secretion. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4is likely a homeostatic brake on Ins(1,4,5)P3-activated insulin secretion initiated both by glucose (21Biden T.J. Peter-Riesch B. Schlegel W. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3567-3571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by parasympathetic innervation of the pancreas (22Gilon P. Henquin J.-C. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 565-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In particular, accumulation of the slowly metabolized (6Vajanaphanich M. Schultz C. Rudolf M.T. Wasserman M. Enyedi P. Craxton A.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3567-3571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could contribute to hyperglycemia-dependent refractoriness of β-cells (23Meyer J. Sturis J. Katschinski M. Arnold R. Göke B. Byrne M.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E917-E922Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which typifies type 2 diabetes etiology (24Kilpatrick E.D. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 606-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that, independently of the status of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 signaling pathway, the cellular level of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 will be elevated in response to a decrease in the prevailing ATP/ADP ratio (25Oliver K.G. Putney J.W., Jr. Obie J.F. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21528-21534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon adds an extra facet to our understanding of the many mechanisms by which the ATP/ADP status of pancreatic β-cells may influence insulin secretion (26Lang J. Eur. J.

We have isolated a novel homeodomain transcription factor, Otx3, which is structurally and functionally related to Otx1 and Otx2, transcription factors that are critical in brain morphogenesis. Mouse Otx3 is a protein composed of 376 amino acids. Otx3 mRNA was expressed in mouse embryos from 10.5 to 13.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and in adult cerebellum as assessed by Northern blotting. Whole-mountin situ hybridization of mouse embryos from 9.5 to 11.5 dpc revealed strong expression of Otx3 mRNA in the diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, myelencephalon, and developing eye, indicating an expression pattern largely overlapping but distinct from those of Otx1 and Otx2. In addition, Otx3 was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to bind to the TAATCC motif, the consensus binding sequence for Otx1, Otx2, and Crx. Results of a transcription reporter assay suggest that Otx3 functions as a transcription repressor by binding to this motif. These results suggest that Otx3 is a novel member of the Otx family and may be involved in the development of the central nervous system.

Mouse Otx3 is a protein composed of 376 amino acids. Otx3 mRNA was expressed in mouse embryos from 10.5 to 13.5 days postcoitum (dpc) and in adult cerebellum as assessed by Northern blotting. Whole-mountin situ hybridization of mouse embryos from 9.5 to 11.5 dpc revealed strong expression of Otx3 mRNA in the diencephalon, mesencephalon, metencephalon, myelencephalon, and developing eye, indicating an expression pattern largely overlapping but distinct from those of Otx1 and Otx2. In addition, Otx3 was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay to bind to the TAATCC motif, the consensus binding sequence for Otx1, Otx2, and Crx. Results of a transcription reporter assay suggest that Otx3 functions as a transcription repressor by binding to this motif. These results suggest that Otx3 is a novel member of the Otx family and may be involved in the development of the central nervous system. central nervous system homeodomain days postcoitum electrophoretic mobility shift assay orthodenticle bicoid thymidine kinase Goosecoid Engrailed krupple, nt, nucleotides amino acids glutathioneS-transferase β-galactosidase Many signal molecules and transcription factors are required in the control of induction, specification, and regionalization of the CNS1 in vertebrates (1Lemaire P.

Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) in which the patterning of the neural primordium has been studied extensively. Among them, the Otx family (Otx1, Otx2, and Crx), the vertebrate homologues oforthodenticle (otd), possesses abicoid (Bcd)-like homeodomain and has been shown to play an important role in brain morphogenesis in vertebrates (3Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). During murine embryogenesis, Otx1 expression is detected first at the early stage of 8.2–8.5 dpc throughout the forebrain and midbrain neuroepithelium and in developing sense organs (4Simeone A. Acampora D. Gulisano M. Stornaiuolo A. Boncinelli E. Nature. 1992; 358: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 5Simeone A. Acampora D. Mallamaci A. Stornaiuolo A. D'Apice M.R. Nigro V. Boncinelli E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). From birth day onward, Otx1 also is expressed at a relatively low level in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland (6Acampora D. Mazan S. Tuorto F. Avantaggiato V. Tremblay J.J. Lazzaro D. di Carlo A. Mariano A. Macchia P.E. Corte G. Macchia V. Drouin J. Brulet P. Simeone A. Development. 1998; 125: 1229-1239PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of mutant mouse models suggest that Otx1 is involved in corticogenesis, sense organ development, and pituitary function (3Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Otx2 is expressed at an earlier developmental stage than Otx1. In mouse, Otx2 already is expressed before the onset of gastrulation in the epiblast and in the visceral endoderm at 5.5 dpc (5Simeone A. Acampora D. Mallamaci A. Stornaiuolo A. D'Apice M.R. Nigro V. Boncinelli E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and also in the headfold at 7.5 dpc (4Simeone A. Acampora D. Gulisano M. Stornaiuolo A. Boncinelli E. Nature. 1992; 358: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). After 8.5 dpc, the expression pattern of Otx2 largely overlaps that of Otx1 with a posterior border at the mesencephalic side of the isthmic constriction during brain regionalization (3Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Simeone A. Acampora D. Gulisano M. Stornaiuolo A. Boncinelli E. Nature. 1992; 358: 687-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Crx also was identified as a member of the Otx family (7Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The expression of Crx is highly restricted to retina where it is profoundly involved in differentiation and maintenance of retinal neurons. HD proteins are thought to be involved in development and differentiation not only in central and peripheral neurons but also in endocrine and neuroendocrine cells (6Acampora D. Mazan S. Tuorto F. Avantaggiato V. Tremblay J.J. Lazzaro D. di Carlo A. Mariano A. Macchia P.E. Corte G. Macchia V. Drouin J. Brulet P. Simeone A. Development. 1998; 125: 1229-1239PubMed Google Scholar, 8Szeto D.P.

It has been shown that many transcription factors necessary in the development of the CNS also are involved in the development of insulin-secreting pancreatic β cells (9Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that known or novel HD transcription factors expressed in pancreatic β cells participate in their development by organizing the regulated expression of the various other transcription factors. In the present study, we have identified a novel HD transcription factor from a pancreatic β cell line that is highly expressed in brain. It possesses a Bcd-like HD structurally and functionally related to that of Otx1 and Otx2 and has been designated Otx3. Our findings suggest that Otx3 may play an important role in brain morphogenesis. A partial cDNA fragment was amplified from the mouse pancreatic β cell line MIN6 by reverse transcriptase PCR using fully degenerate primers corresponding to the following amino acid sequences: R(S/E)RT(T/A)FT and QVWFKNR, both of which are highly conserved among most HD proteins. The bands of interest from the PCR were excised from a 2% agarose gel and then subcloned and sequenced. A DNA fragment having a novel HD was identified. This cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen the MIN6 cDNA library under high stringency hybridization conditions to isolate the full-length cDNA encoding Otx3. RNA was extracted from adult Sprague-Dawley rat tissues and cell lines, and 20 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The Northern blot of full stage (4.5–18.5 dpc) mouse embryos was purchased from Seegene (Seoul, Korea), each line containing 20 μg of total RNA. An 802-bp fragment of Otx3 cDNA (nt 1–802), a full-length coding region of Otx1 cDNA, and a 523-bp fragment of Otx2 cDNA (nt 103–625) were used as probes for the hybridization of Northern blots. Hybridization was performed under standardized conditions. Membranes were washed with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1 h and at 50 °C for 1 h before autoradiography. Whole-mount and section RNA in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (10Akasaka T. van Lohuizen M. van der Lugt N. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Kanno M. Taniguchi M. Vidal M. Alkema M. Berns A. Koseki H. Development. 2001; 128: 1587-1597PubMed Google Scholar). The cRNA probes for Otx1 and Otx2 were synthesized based on the sequences from GenBankTM accession numbers AF424700 and P80206, respectively. Otx1 and Otx2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR from a mouse brain cDNA library using specific primers and subcloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For whole-mount in situ hybridization, digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were synthesized using linearized DNA templates in pBluescript vector (Otx3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pGEM-T easy vector (Otx1 and Otx2). Transcription reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions using T3 (for Otx3) and SP6 (for Otx1 and Otx2) RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of a digoxigenin-NTP mixture. For in situ hybridization of Otx3 on embryo sections, 35S-labeled riboprobes were synthesized using T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of 35S-UTP (AmershamBiosciences). For EMSA, a partial Otx3 protein (aa 76–148) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia coli using pGEX4T-1 vector (AmershamBiosciences) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). The HD-containing peptide of Otx2 (aa 34–208) was produced using the same method. Oligonucleotide sequences used as labeled probes in EMSA were as follows: HD consensus sequence, 5′-CAGTAAGCCTTTAATCCTGTCT-3′ and its exact complement; mutant HD consensus sequence, 5′-CAGTAAGCCAGATCTCCTGTCT-3′ and its exact complement. The HD consensus sequence contains the binding sequence (TAATCC) for Otx1, Otx2, and Crx. This sequence is disrupted in the mutant HD consensus sequence. The double-stranded probe was 32P-radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The radiolabeled probe was mixed within vitro translated proteins, and EMSA was performed as described previously (11Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The Otx3 expression vector (pCMV-Otx3) and the Otx2 expression vector (pCMV-Otx2) were generated by subcloning the entire coding region of mouse Otx3 cDNA and partial mouse Otx2 cDNA (nt 100–867) into pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen), respectively. A chimeric construct (Otx3N/Otx2C) consisting of the N terminus of mouse Otx3 (aa 1–125) and the C terminus of mouse Otx2 (aa 98–289) was generated and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(−), which contains the HD domain of Otx3 and OTX-tail of Otx2 (7Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmid (pP3Ctk-Luc) was generated to express luciferase under the control of thymidine kinase (tk) minimal promoter linked to triple repeats (P3C) of the synthesized oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding sequence (TAATCC) for the Otx family. Neuroendocrine-derived GH3 cells were used for the transcription reporter assay. Cells on 3.5-cm dishes were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA containing 250 ng of pP3Ctk-Luc and 100 ng of pAct-β-gal with or without the various Otx constructs described above. Activity was assayed in cells transfected with 250 ng of Otx3 alone, 250 ng of Otx2 alone, 250 ng of Otx2 plus 250 ng of Otx3, or 250 ng of Otx3N/Otx2C alone. The total amount of DNA was adjusted to 1 μg by adding empty vector DNA. Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity and β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity were measured. pAct-β-gal, which expresses β-gal, was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Since a partial DNA fragment obtained from degenerate PCR was suggested to be a novel transcription factor, its full-length cDNA was isolated from a mouse MIN6 cDNA library and sequenced (Fig.1 A). Sequence analysis revealed a novel member belonging to the HD gene family that was designated mouse Otx3 (GenBankTM accession numberAB037698). The deduced open reading frame encodes 376 amino acids with a predicted mass of 40 kDa. The HD of mouse Otx3 shows homology to HD-containing transcription factors including members of the Pax, HOX, and Pitx families. Among these, Otx3 has the highest amino acid identity with Otx1, Otx2, and Crx (65% for each one). Further, it possesses a lysine at the 50th amino acid residue in the HD, a feature shared by all of the members of the Otx family, while Otx3 lacks the so-called OTX-tail that is conserved among the other Otx members (7Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). However, Otx3 lacks the other known domains, including the paired, HOX, and POU domains present in the Pax, HOX, and Pitx families. We also have identified a human full-length Otx3 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AB037699) from a fetal brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The amino acid identity between mouse and human Otx3 is 94.4% (data not shown). To examine the tissue expression pattern of Otx3, total RNA from various adult rat tissues, endocrine cell lines, and mouse embryos at 4.5–18.5 dpc was analyzed by Northern blotting. A single abundant transcript of 4.3 kb was detected in MIN6 and adult cerebellum, but no signal was observed in adult pancreatic islets or the other cells and tissues (Fig. 1 C). However, expression in adult pancreatic islets was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase PCR with Otx3-specific primers (data not shown). During embryogenesis, the Otx3 transcript was detected from 10.5 to 13.5 dpc in mouse embryos (Fig. 1 D). To compare the expression pattern of Otx3 with Otx1 and Otx2 during mouse development, the expression of Otx1 and Otx2 also was evaluated in the same blot (data not shown). A single Otx1 transcript of about 3.5 kb was detected from 10.5 to 15.5 dpc in mouse embryos. Although a single Otx2 transcript of about 3.3 kb was detected from 7.5 to 18.5 dpc in mouse embryos, most abundant Otx2 mRNA was detected from 10.5 to 13.5 dpc. The temporal expression pattern of Otx3 overlaps that of Otx1 and Otx2 during embryogenesis, especially from 10.5 to 13.5 dpc. To investigate Otx3 expression at early midgestational stages of mouse development and to obtain more detailed information on the localization of Otx3 mRNA expression in the embryos, we performed whole-mountin situ hybridization of mouse embryos from 8.5 to 11.5 dpc (Fig. 2 A, A1–A3). For comparison, whole-mount in situ hybridization of Otx2 (Fig. 2 A, A4–A6) and Otx1 (Fig. 2 A,A7–A9) also were performed in mouse embryos from 9.5 to 11.5 dpc. At 8.5 dpc, Otx3 transcripts were detected in the prospective midbrain region and preoptic placode (data not shown). From 9.5 to 11.5 dpc, Otx3 expression was craniocaudally delimited to the rostral region of the developing nervous system (Fig. 2 A,A1–A3). In 9.5 dpc embryos, the anterior and posterior boundaries of Otx3 expression coincide with those of the diencephalon and mesencephalon, respectively (Fig. 2 A, A1). Beginning from 10.5 dpc, Otx3 expression progressively declines in the anterior region, and the most intense hybridization signal coincides with the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (Fig. 2 A,A2, arrowhead). In addition, Otx3 expression was observed in the developing eye (Fig. 2 A, A2 andA3). At 11.5 dpc, Otx3 expression is enhanced gradually in a craniocaudal direction within the mesencephalon, metencephalon, and myelencephalon (Fig. 2 A, A3). To investigate Otx3 expression along the dorsoventral axis, we performed in situ hybridization on transverse sections through the mesencephalon of 10.5 dpc embryos and found that Otx3 is expressed, but not in the floor plate (Fig. 2 B,B1 and B2). In 13.5 dpc embryos, Otx3 expression is present in the mesencephalon and extends posteriorly to regions of the metencephalon and myelencephalon as shown in sagittal sections (Fig. 2 B, B3 and B4). Similarly to Otx3, Otx1 and Otx2 are expressed in the restricted regions of the developing forebrain and midbrain in early midgestation of mouse embryos as reported previously (3Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In 9.5 dpc embryos, Otx1 is expressed intensely in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and optic vesicles (Fig. 2 A, A7). Otx2 is expressed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon as well as in optic vesicles at 9.5 dpc (Fig. 2 A, A4). At 10.5 dpc, Otx1 expression is still seen in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and optic cups as in 9.5 dpc embryos (Fig.2 A, A8). Otx2 expression is observed in the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and optic cups as is Otx3, but Otx2 is only barely visible in the telencephalon at 10.5 dpc (Fig.2 A, A5). In 11.5 dpc embryos, Otx1 is expressed in the telencephalon as well as the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and developing eye (Fig. 2 A, A9), while Otx2 expression is restricted to the mesencephalon and optic cups (Fig.2 A, A6). The expression patterns of Otx3, Otx2, and Otx1 are schematically summarized by a line diagram in Fig.2 A, A10 (9.5 dpc), A11 (10.5 dpc), andA12 (11.5 dpc). All three genes are expressed in the mesencephalon and diencephalon throughout these stages, while only Otx3 is expressed in the metencephalon and myelencephalon at 11.5 dpc. The Otx family has lysine at the 50th position of the HD, which confers DNA binding specificity for the sequence motif TAATC(C/T) (the consensus for Otx1 and Otx2) or TAATC(C/A) (the consensus for Crx) (5Simeone A. Acampora D. Mallamaci A. Stornaiuolo A. D'Apice M.R. Nigro V. Boncinelli E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L.

Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The binding of Otx3 to the motif TAATCC was tested using EMSA. A fusion protein of GST and the HD of Otx3 was incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes. Otx3 HD showed strong binding to the HD consensus sequence in Fig. 3 A, lane 3. Fusion protein GST-Otx2 was used as a positive control. Specificity of Otx3 binding to the HD consensus sequence was examined by a competition experiment. The excess amount of unlabeled competitor of the HD consensus sequence resulted in a remarkable inhibition of the DNA binding activity of Otx3. However, binding was not inhibited by competition with the mutant HD consensus sequence (Fig.3 B). To assay the activity of Otx3 as a transcription factor, a transcription reporter assay was performed in the neuroendocrine cell line GH3. Co-transfection of the cells with pP3Ctk-Luc and pCMV-Otx2 stimulated luciferase activity to 29-fold the activity in cells transfected with pP3Ctk-Luc alone (basal activity). When the cells were co-transfected with pP3Ctk-Luc and pCMV-Otx3, luciferase expression was suppressed to 36.6 ± 5.7% of the basal level (Fig. 3 C). When the cells were co-transfected with pCMV-Otx3 and pCMV-Otx2 at a 1:1 ratio, reporter activity was suppressed to one-third the activity from Otx2 alone. This suggests that Otx3 functions as a transcription repressor of the Otx2 by acting competitively on the consensus sequence. We also generated a chimeric construct consisting of Otx3 and Otx2, in which the C terminus of Otx3 is replaced with that of Otx2. This replacement results in the reversion of Otx3 to an activator (438.6 ± 63.1%) from a repressor (36.6 ± 5.7%). We have identified a novel transcription factor, Otx3. Otx3 contains a Bcd-like HD that is conserved among HD proteins, including the Drosophila anterior morphogen Bcd(13Berleth T. Burri M. Thoma G. Bopp D. Richstein S. Frigerio G. Noll M.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The sequence similarities between Otx3 and Otx1, Otx2, and Crx indicate that Otx3 is structurally related to these members of the Otx family. In addition, the conservation of lysine in HD also suggests that Otx3 is a member of the Otx family. We examined mRNA expression of Otx3 by Northern blot analysis of adult tissues and clonal cell lines and found that Otx3 was most abundantly expressed in brain rather than in the endocrine pancreas. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of Otx3 during embryogenesis were further investigated in mouse embryos by Northern blotting and whole-mount in situ analyses. During embryogenesis, Otx3 mRNA expression was detected first at day 8.5 dpc and was most abundant from 9.5 to 11.5 dpc. During this developmental period, Otx1 and Otx2 have been shown to be expressed and to participate in brain morphogenesis (3Acampora D. Gulisano M. Broccoli V. Simeone A. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 64: 69-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed at different embryonic stages from 8.5 to 11.5 dpc. At day 8.5 dpc, Otx3 was expressed in the prospective midbrain region and preoptic placode. At day 9.5–11.5 dpc, the high level expression of Otx3 in the head became restricted to the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and developing eye, although it was also expressed in the metencephalon and myelencephalon. The spatial expression pattern of Otx3 during mouse embryogenesis largely overlapped that of Otx1 and Otx2. Otx1 and Otx2 are thought to cooperate in brain morphogenesis (18Suda Y. Matsuo I. Aizawa S. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 125-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); studies of knockout mice (Otx1 −/− Otx2 +/− mice (19Acampora D. Avantaggiato V. Tuorto F. Simeone A. Development. 1997; 124: 3639-3650PubMed Google Scholar) and Otx1 +/− Otx2 +/−mice (20Suda Y. Nakabayashi J. Matsuo I. Aizawa S. Development. 1999; 126: 743-757PubMed Google Scholar)) indicate that the Otx gene dosage is critical in correct positioning of the isthmic organizer. At this midbrain-hindbrain boundary, Otx3 expression showed the most intense hybridization signal during brain developmental stages. This finding suggests that Otx3 together with Otx1 or Otx2 may be involved in positioning in this area. Since the resemblance in the expression patterns of Otx3, Otx1, and Otx2 should reflect their functional similarities, we examined the DNA binding properties and the transcriptional activity of Otx3. As previously reported, lysine at position 50 in the HD is critical for DNA binding; the substitution of the lysine of the Bcd with glutamine has been shown to result in the loss of DNA binding specificity (12Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Because all of these HD proteins recognize the same binding sites with high specificity (12Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 553-562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Hanes S.D. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1275-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), we assumed that Otx3 would bind to the consensus sequences of Bcd-like HD proteins by interaction with the HD domain of Otx3. Indeed EMSA revealed that Otx3 specifically binds to the consensus sequence TAATCC. In addition, EMSA showed that Otx3 also binds to TAATCA, the consensus sequence for Crx (data not shown). We next determined whether or not Otx3 acts as a transcription factor using a luciferase reporter assay in GH3 cells. Otx3 was shown to act as a transcription factor by binding to the TAATCC sequence. The result of the luciferase reporter assay showed that Otx3 represses the transcription activity triggered by the tk minimal promoter. In addition, the reporter assay of the co-transfection experiments with Otx3 and Otx2 showed that Otx3 significantly suppressed Otx2-induced transcription activity, suggesting that Otx3 functions as a transcription repressor of Otx2 by acting competitively on the target sequence. Interestingly Otx3 lacks the “OTX-tail,” a conserved motif of about 20 amino acids that is generally believed to confer transactivation activity in the Otx family (7Furukawa T. Morrow E.M. Cepko C.L. Cell. 1997; 91: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 22Chau K.Y. Chen S. Zack D.J. Ono S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37264-37270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, the motif contains an alanine-rich region in the C terminus that is similar to the repression domain in someDrosophila transcription repressors, includingGsc (15Mailhos C. Andre S. Mollereau B. Goriely A. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Desplan C. Development. 1998; 125: 937-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Goriely A. Stella M. Coffinier C. Kessler D. Mailhos C. Dessain S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 1641-1650PubMed Google Scholar), Engrailed (En),Eve, and kruppel (kr) (23Han K. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and may be an important feature of repressor proteins (23Han K. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In each case, the repressor domain consists of at least 26% alanine residues, while 33% of the residues of the alanine-rich domain were alanine in Otx3. In addition, replacing the C terminus of Otx3 with that of Otx2 changed the transcriptional character of Otx3 from repressor to activator. Together these findings suggest that the C terminus of Otx3 acts as a transcription repressor, but further experiments are required to establish that Otx3 functions as a repressor of brain function. It should be noted that the spatial and temporal expression patterns of Otx3, Otx1, and Otx2 are similar but not identical. At 9.5 dpc, Otx3 was not expressed in telencephalon, while both Otx1 and Otx2 were expressed in this area. At 10.5 and 11.5 dpc, the expression pattern of Otx3 resembled that of Otx2 but not Otx1 as assessed by whole-mountin situ hybridization. Analysis of in situhybridization in sections at 13.5 dpc showed that the expression pattern of Otx3 in the myelencephalon was distinct from those of Otx1 and Otx2. Thus, Otx3 expression is craniocaudally more restricted than Otx1 and Otx2. Furthermore, the phenotypes of Otx1 (Otx1 −/−) and Otx2 (Otx2 −/−) knockout mice are different:Otx2 −/− mice lack forebrain and midbrain, which is embryonically lethal (24Acampora D. Mazan S.

Accordingly, although Otx3 is likely involved in brain morphogenesis in concert with Otx1 and Otx2, it may have a functionally distinct role from that Otx1 and Otx2."
https://openalex.org/W1966300077,"H-rev107 is a tumor suppressor originally isolated in revertants of H-ras-transformed cell lines. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues but down-regulated in primary carcinomas or in many cell lines derived from tumors, including WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells. Here, we show that unlike inH-rev107-expressing cells or tissues the 5′-end ofH-rev107 containing a CpG-rich region of 421 bp is highly methylated in WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells, correlating with silencing of this gene. Repression of H-rev107 transcription in these cells could be relieved by chemically induced hypomethylation with 5-aza-dC. In addition, upon in vitro methylation, expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by theH-rev107 promoter decreased by 80% in WEHI 7.1 and 293 cells. Furthermore, co-transfection of the methyl-CpG binding proteins, MeCP2 and MBD2, inhibited H-rev107 promoter activity up to 70% in SL2 cells when the promoter was methylated. By chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we observed in vivo binding of MeCP2 and MBD2 to the 5′-end of H-rev107 in WEHI 7.1 cells, which was reduced to undetectable levels upon 5-aza-dC treatment, concluding that MeCP2 and MBD2 might be involved in silencing the methylated H-rev107 gene in lymphoma cells and probably certain tumors.

H-ras revertant gene 107 H-ras revertant protein 107 cytomegalovirus reverse transcription trichostatin A chromatin immunoprecipitation Recently, H-rev1071 encoding a class II tumor suppressor, as defined by its reversible down-regulation and growth-inhibiting capacity inras-transformed cell lines, has been identified and characterized (1Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). H-rev107 is an ubiquitously expressed gene encoding a 16-kDa protein localized in both the cytoplasm and cell membrane (1Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). Only recently, it became evident that H-rev107 is a member of a novel family of proteins involved in the control of cell proliferation. This protein family includes A-C1, predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, and TIG3/RIG1/hH-Rev107–2, a retinoid-induced gene in keratinocytes and gastric cancer cells (2Akiyama H. Hiraki Y.

Using subtractive cDNA cloning, H-rev107 has been cloned as a gene highly expressed in a revertant cell line isolated from H-ras transformed rat fibroblasts (1Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schäfer R. Iyer J. Iten E. Nirkko A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Besides, high expression of H-rev107 has been observed in fibroblasts that are resistant toward transformation by activated H-rasoncogenes (1Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar). While H-rev107 overexpression in H-Ras-expressing cell lines resulted in reduction of colony formation and attenuated tumor growth in nude mice, implying its tumor-suppressing activity (7Sers C. Emmenegger U. Husmann K. Bucher K. Andres A.C. Schäfer R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), Siegrist et al. demonstrated a down-regulation of H-rev107 expression in testicular germ cell tumors (8Siegrist S. Feral C.

Its antiproliferative activity was also indicated by the fact that cells overexpressing H-rev107 could not be maintained in culture for an extended period of time (1Hajnal A. Klemenz R. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 479-490PubMed Google Scholar, 6Schäfer R. Iyer J. Iten E. Nirkko A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, the H-rev107-related proteins, A-C1 and TIG3, significantly inhibited cell proliferation of H-ras-transformed NIH3T3 and wild-type 293 cells, respectively (2Akiyama H. Hiraki Y. Noda M. Shigeno C. Ito H. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32192-32197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 3DiSepio D. Ghosn C. Eckert R.L. Deucher A. Robinson N. Duvic M.

By examining expression ofH-rev107 in a variety of human and rat tumors and tumor cell lines, Husmann et al. (5Husmann K. Sers C. Fietze E. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1998; 10: 1305-1312Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar) came to the conclusion thatH-rev107 expression is silenced at the level of transcription and translation rather than by deletions or mutations that are frequently used for silencing of tumor suppressor genes. As a first step toward studying its transcriptional regulation in cancer cells, we cloned and examined the murine H-rev107gene and its promoter and identified a GC-box at −83/−75 that binds Sp1/Sp3 in vivo and is essential for the transcription ofH-rev107. 2Roder, K., Latasa, M.-J., and Sul, H. S. (2002)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 293,793–799.2Roder, K., Latasa, M.-J., and Sul, H. S. (2002)Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 293,793–799. In the present study, we sought to determine the molecular mechanism by whichH-rev107 expression is silenced in certain tumor cell lines. Using the H-rev107-negative murine lymphoma cell line, WEHI 7.1, as a model system, we demonstrate that transcriptional silencing of H-rev107 strongly correlates with the methylation status of the CpG-rich region of its 5′-end and involvement and in vivo binding of the methyl-CpG-binding proteins, MeCP2 and MBD2, in the repression of H-rev107 transcription. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Murine WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, and human hepatoma HepG2 and embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human SK-BR-3 adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Mac Coy's 5a medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum. For 5-aza-dC (Sigma) treatment, cells were split to low density 24 h before treatment. Cells were then treated with 5-aza-dC (5 or 10 μm) or were mock-treated with the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline for 72–96 h changing the medium every 24 h. Total RNA was isolated from tissues excised by rapid dissection, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen) using a power homogenizer (Polytron). Total RNA was isolated from cell lines using TRIzol. Northern blot analysis was performed as described recently (10Kim K.-H. Lee K. Moon Y.S. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11252-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were reverse transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, then 20 (H-rev107, β-actin), 30 (H-rev107: WEHI 7.1), or 33 cycles (p15Ink4b) of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and finally 5 min at 72 °C. The primer sequences for the amplification of H-rev107, p15Ink4b, and β-actin fragments are shown in Table I. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel.Table IList of primers used in this study. Genomic DNA from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, WEHI 7.1 cells, and different mouse tissues was isolated using the DNeasyTMTissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA (5 μg) was digested with HindIII and purified. After denaturation in 0.3 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C in 10 μl of volume, the DNA was mixed with 100 μl of sodium metabisulfite (Sigma) containing 0.5 mm hydroquinone (pH 5.0; Sigma) and cycled in a thermal cycler at 50 °C for 45 min and 95 °C for 2 min for 22 cycles. The bisulfite-treated DNA was desalted using the Wizard DNA Clean-up Kit (Promega) and eluted in 100 μl of H2O. The DNA was then desulfonated in the presence of 0.3m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the DNA was precipitated in ethanol by adding 11 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2), washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 70 μl of H2O. The CpG-rich region in the H-rev107 gene from −199 to +291 was amplified by PCR. The primer sequences for the amplification ofH-rev107 (MSP1, MSP2) are listed in Table I. PCR conditions for the reaction were 95 °C for 2 min, then 36 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 5 min at 72 °C. The amplification was performed in a 50-μl volume containing 100 ng of each primer, 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Promega), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, 1× buffer, and 10 μl of bisulfite-modified DNA. The products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, gel-purified, and cloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega). DNA from at least eight clones per cell line/tissue was prepared for automatic sequencing. The construction of allH-rev107-luciferase reporter constructs used in this study has been described previously.2 The cDNA of MeCP2 was released by an EcoRI digest from pCMV-MeCP2-HA, a generous gift from A. Bird (University of Edinburgh, UK), and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to construct pcDNA3.1-MeCP2-HA. Similarly, the cDNAs of MBD2a and MBD3 were released byHindIII/XhoI digests from pcDNA3-HA-hMBD2a and pcDNA3-HA-hMBD3 (generous gifts from F. Ishikawa and M. Saito, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan) and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) to obtain pcDNA3.1-HA-hMBD2a and pcDNA3.1-HA-hMBD3. pAc5(+) is an expression vector for Drosophila containing the Ac5 promoter and the vector backbone, including the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1(+) without the CMV promoter. Using the same restriction sites as for the cloning into pcDNA3.1(+), the cDNAs of MeCP2, MBD2a, and MBD3 were cloned into pAc5(+) to obtain pAc5-HA-MeCP2, pAc5-HA-hMBD2a, and pAc5-HA-hMBD3, respectively. pGL3-H-rev107(−516/+457) was in vitro methylated by SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) following the recommendations by the manufacturer. Mock-methylated reporter plasmid served as control. Methylated and mock-methylated constructs were digested with KpnI and NcoI to release the 973-bp H-rev107 fragment. In each case, the H-rev107 fragment was separated from the vector backbone by gel purification using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Additionally, pGL3-Basic (Promega Biotech) was digested with NcoI and SalI, and the released DNA fragment containing the luciferase gene with a 3′-SV40 poly(A) signal was gel-purified. Methylated H-rev107 DNA was finally ligated with the luciferase/poly(A)-containing DNA fragment. The ligation products were digested with KpnI and SalI and correctly ligated DNA fragments consisting of the H-rev107promoter/exon upstream of the luciferase gene were gel-purified and used for stable transfections. Mock-methylated H-rev107 DNA ligated with the luciferase/poly(A)-containing DNA fragment served as control. For transfection, 3 × 106 WEHI 7.1 cells were seeded into six wells. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of luciferase reporter and 40 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase expression vector for normalization were used for transfection. 293 cells (six wells) were transiently transfected with 8 μg of total DNA, including 250–1000 ng of luciferase reporter, 5 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase expression vector, and sheared salmon sperm DNA by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method. 3T3-L1 cells (six wells) were transiently transfected with 2–8 μg of luciferase reporter and 10–60 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase expression vector using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method. After 48 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were analyzed by using the Dual-Light Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix). Transfections were generally carried out in duplicate. Schneider's Drosophila melanogaster cell line 2 (SL 2) was maintained in Shields and Sang M3 insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at room temperature with atmospheric CO2. For transfection, cells were plated onto 12-well plates at 1.5 × 106 cells/well and transfected by the calcium phosphate method 6 h later. Each well received 5 μg of DNA, including 2.5 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 40 ng of pAc5.1/V5-His/lacZ (Invitrogen), and varying amounts of expression plasmid such as pAc5-HA-MeCP2, pAc5-HA-hMBD2a, or pAc5-HA-hMBD3. The amounts of the expression plasmids were adjusted with the control plasmid pAc5(+). The medium was changed 24 h later, and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Luciferase values were normalized against β-galactosidase values. Exponentially growing 293 cells (six well) were transfected with 15 ng of pcDNA6/V5-His C (Invitrogen) conferring resistance to blasticidin, 100 ng of the patch-methylatedH-rev107(−516/+457)-luciferase/poly(A)-containing DNA fragment and 8 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA. After 48 h, cells were split at a ratio of 1:10, and stable transfectants were selected in 5 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) for 1 week. Resultant colonies were pooled for further analysis to compensate for positional effects on promoter activity. Luciferase activities were analyzed and normalized to protein concentration. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was exactly performed as described recently.2 To identify the methyl-CpG-binding proteins, 10 μl of MeCP2 (kindly provided by Dr. P. Jones, NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) or MBD2/3 (kindly provided by Dr. P. A. Wade, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA) antiserum were added to the chromatin. Due to the high similarity between MBD2 and MBD3 (11Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), MBD2/3 antiserum is able to recognize both MBD2 and MBD3. Primers for analyzing samples by PCR are listed in Table I. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of an 0.7-kb H-rev107 transcript in all adult mouse tissues analyzed (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with previous expression studies on rat and humanH-rev107 (5Husmann K. Sers C. Fietze E. Mincheva A. Lichter P. Schäfer R. Oncogene. 1998; 10: 1305-1312Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 7Sers C. Emmenegger U. Husmann K. Bucher K. Andres A.C. Schäfer R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). While a high level of murineH-rev107 mRNA was detected in kidney, only moderate to low expression levels were seen in other tissues. This expression profile was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (data not shown). Next, we compared the expression of H-rev107 in tumor and non-tumor culture cell lines. We examined H-rev107 expression by RT-PCR in murine NIH3T3 and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells, as well as human hepatoma HepG2, embryonic kidney 293, and adenocarcinoma SK-BR-3 cells (Fig. 1B). Low expression was detectable in all cell lines except in WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells, whereH-rev107 was not detectable. To identify the sequence responsible for the transcriptional down-regulation of H-rev107 in WEHI 7.1 cells, a series of 5′-H-rev107 promoter deletion constructs containing the various H-rev107 5′-flanking fragments (from nucleotide −7631 to nucleotide −43) in sense orientation upstream of the luciferase reporter gene were introduced intoH-rev107-positive 3T3-L1 cells and H-rev107-negative WEHI 7.1 cells. A rat fatty acid synthase promoter-luciferase fusion plasmid2 was used as a positive control. As shown in Table II, unlike theH-rev107 expression data obtained by RT-PCR analysis (Fig.1B), 3T3-L1 and WEHI 7.1 cells showed almost the same levels of luciferase activity with all constructs employed. These data indicated that WEHI 7.1 cells do not have a defect in the basal transcription machinery that is required for the expression of theH-rev107 gene.Table IIPromoter activity of the mouse H-rev107 gene in murine WEHI 7.1 lymphoma cells and 3T3-L1 fibroblasts.Promoter constructRelative promoter activity3T3-L1WEHI 7.1pGL3-Basic1.01.0FAS(−1592/+65)61.6 ± 9.363.0 ± 8.2H-rev107(−7631/+30)18.8 ± 3.98.7 ± 1.2H-rev107(−2106/+30)30.6 ± 6.421.5 ± 1.7H-rev107(−1508/+30)33.4 ± 5.617.6 ± 2.6H-rev107(−966/+30)33.9 ± 3.517.1 ± 1.0H-rev107(−516/+30)27.2 ± 4.521.8 ± 6.9H-rev107(−516/+457)30.2 ± 9.326.8 ± 5.8H-rev107(−356/+30)25.6 ± 6.419.3 ± 3.7H-rev107(−157/+30)26.4 ± 3.815.6 ± 3.1H-rev107(−113/+30)24.7 ± 7.923.9 ± 5.3H-rev107(−74/+30)1.5 ± 0.41.5 ± 0.4H-rev107(−43/+30)1.1 ± 0.32.0 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Since we could not detect any obvious defect in theH-rev107 gene nor the transcriptional machinery (data not shown), we explored the possibility that the expression ofH-rev107 in WEHI 7.1 cells is epigenetically modified by methylation. Silencing of a number of genes in immortalized and transformed cell lines as well as in primary tumors has been shown to be mediated by promoter hypermethylation (12Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1388) Google Scholar). Although there was a significant accumulation of CpG dinucleotides around the transcription start site (−171/+251), the analysis of the 5′-flanking sequence and first intron of the H-rev107 gene (Fig.2A) did not reveal any region that satisfies the criteria for a CpG island (13Gardiner-Garden M. Frommer M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 261-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar), a classical feature of widely expressed genes, i.e. at least 200 bp with an average CpG content (percent observed/percent expected) of more than 0.6 and an average (C + G) content of more than 50%. Nevertheless, to obtain precise information about the methylation status of the 5′-end of H-rev107, bisulfite genomic sequencing was carried out (Fig. 2B). Genomic DNA is treated with bisulfite under conditions that convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil, whereas the 5-methylcytosine remains unchanged. Within the region analyzed, virtually all CpG sites were unmethylated in DNA from all mouse tissues studied, suggesting that methylation of CpG dinucleotides does not play a role in tissue-specific differences in H-rev107 expression as detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the two H-rev107-positive non-transformed fibroblast cell lines, viz. NIH3T3 and 3T3-L1, showed no or only moderate methylation (mainly at +157 and +159) in the H-rev107 region studied. On the other hand, unlike in fibroblasts, theH-rev107-negative WEHI 7.1 cells showed almost complete methylation of the region between −171 and +251 of theH-rev107 gene. These results indicate that aberrant cytosine methylation of the 5′-H-rev107 gene is associated with transcriptional repression in WEHI 7.1. To test the potential role of DNA methylation in the control of H-rev107 expression, demethylation was induced by treatment with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. WEHI 7.1 cells were grown for 24–72 h in the presence of 1–5 μm 5-aza-dC. Indeed, 5-aza-dC treatment allowed re-expression of H-rev107 as shown by RT-PCR (Fig.3A). Moreover, the expression of H-rev107 in 5-aza-dC-treated cells progressively decreased after withdrawal of the demethylating agent and disappeared almost entirely after about 3 weeks of culture (Fig. 3B). The gradual disappearance of H-rev107 expression in the cell population subsequent to 5-aza-dC treatment might have resulted either from a gradual remethylation of the demethylated cells or from selection against the most demethylated, growth-impaired cells. The latter scenario has been described to be the cause for the progressive disappearance of MAGE-A1 re-expression in melanoma cells after withdrawal of 5-aza-dC (14De Smet C. Lurquin C. Lethé B. Martelange V. Boon T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). However, bisulfite genomic sequencing indicated that the 5′-end of the H-rev107 gene was efficiently demethylated in 5-aza-dC-treated WEHI 7.1 cells when compared with mock-treated cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the (de)methylation status of the 5′-H-rev107 gene is critical for H-rev107 expression. To determine whether methylation of the 5′-end of H-rev107 is sufficient to silence its expression, pGL3-H-rev107(−516/+457) containing the entire CpG-rich region was methylated in vitro by SssI, an enzyme that methylates every CpG dinucleotide. Methylated and mock-methylated reporter plasmids then were transfected into H-rev107-negative WEHI 7.1 and H-rev107-positive 293 cells. As shown in Fig.4A, the luciferase activity in WEHI 7.1 and 293 cells transfected with the mock-methylated construct was ∼5-fold higher than that in cells transfected with the methylated plasmid. These results show that methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the 5′-H-rev107 gene represses promoter activity in cells that do not express H-rev107 and even in cells that can express the endogenous H-rev107 gene. To clarify the functional relationship between the methylation status and transcriptional activity in a genomic context, we established a pool of stably transfected 293 cells having integrated copies of a methylatedH-rev107(−516/+457) fragment fused to the luciferase reporter gene. These cells were grown for 72 h in the presence of 5 μm 5-aza-dC. The promoter activity of the integrated fusion gene increased ∼4-fold after 5-aza-dC treatment (Fig.4B). Because of the known dynamic linkage between DNA methylation and histone deacetylation (15Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), we tested whether changes in histone acetylation could affect the silencing ofH-rev107 in WEHI 7.1 cells. Treatment of WEHI 7.1 cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, reactivated expression ofH-rev107 (data not shown). In agreement with this observation, TSA treatment induced reporter gene activity severalfold only in a pool of stably transfected 293 cells having integrated copies of a methylated H-rev107(−516/+457) promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene but not in cells transfected with the mock-methylated H-rev107(−516/+457) fusion construct (data not shown). However, TSA treatment caused a similar increase (4–5-fold) in the promoter activity from methylated and mock-methylated constructs upon transiently transfection (data not shown). This suggests that TSA-sensitive histone deacetylase activity is not essential for the methylation-mediated repression of theH-rev107 gene, at least not on a partly chromatinized plasmid. Transcriptional repression by CpG methylation can be mediated by members of the MBD family of proteins, viz. MBD1, MBD2, MBD3, MBD4, and MeCP2 (15Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). MeCP2 is an integral component of chromatin, has abundant binding sites in the mammalian genome (17Nan X. Campoy F.J. Bird A. Cell. 1997; 88: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), and like MBD1 and MBD2, it has been shown to repress transcription by recruiting HDAC activity to the methylated promotersin vitro (Refs. 15Ballestar E. Wolffe A.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and 16Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and references therein). Therefore we analyzed whether MeCP2 and/or MBD2 could suppress the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid containing the methylated 5′-end of theH-rev107 gene. Co-transfections were performed withDrosophila SL2 cells, which do not express endogenous MeCP2 or MBD2 (Fig. 5). For each construct, titration of four concentrations of effector was performed. Upon transfection of methylated pGL3-H-rev107(−516/+457) into SL2 cells, a 40% repression of reporter activity was detected (data not shown). When MeCP2 or MBD2 was co-transfected with the methylatedH-rev107 construct, promoter activity was repressed up to 60–70% in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, both proteins also showed an inhibitory effect on mock-methylated promoter at a lower but significant level of 30–40%. Inhibitory effects of MeCP2 on unmethylated promoter constructs have been described recently for the placental lactogen I, BRCA1, and cyclin A1 genes (18Cho J.-H. Kimura H. Minami T. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Magdinier F. Billard L.-M. Wittmann G. Frappart L. Benchaı̈b M. Lenoir G.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3316-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This phenomenon probably was caused by a non-specific binding activity of MeCP2 as observed by Nan et al. (21Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Since EMSA and co-transfection studies (Fig. 5) could only indicate the binding of MBD2/MeCP2 to the 5′-end of theH-rev107 gene in vitro, we set out to investigate whether MeCP2 and/or MBD2 are bound to this region in living WEHI 7.1 cells. To this end, we used a formaldehyde chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) to monitor MeCP2 and MBD2 occupancy in the 5′-H-rev107 gene. This protocol involves treating living cells with formaldehyde to cross-link proteins bound in vivoto the promoter and immunoprecipitation of the protein-DNA complexes with an antibody specific for the DNA-binding protein of interest, e.g. for MeCP2 and MBD2, followed by analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA by PCR using gene-specific primers. Binding of both MeCP2 and MBD2 to the H-rev107 gene in intact WEHI 7.1 cells was detected by ethidium bromide staining of the corresponding PCR product (Fig. 6A). In WEHI 7.1 cells, not only H-rev107 is silenced but also the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitorp15Ink4b (Fig. 6B), which has been suggested to be involved in leukemo- and lymphomagenesis (Ref. 22Quesnel B. Fenaux P. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1999; 35: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and references therein). The importance of p15Ink4b as a tumor suppressor gene and its inactivation by hypermethylation of its CpG island in hematological malignancies are well established (22Quesnel B. Fenaux P. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1999; 35: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In WEHI 7.1 cells, p15Ink4b is re-expressed upon treatment with 5-aza-dC (Fig. 6B). Therefore, we tested whether MBD binding to the 5′-end of p15Ink4b, similar to H-rev107, is involved in the methylation-dependent inactivation of this gene. The formaldehyde cross-linking assay was carried out to examine possible MeCP2/MBD2 occupancy in the 5′-p15Ink4b gene (Fig.6A). Indeed, after incubation of sonicated chromatin from WEHI 7.1 cells with MBD2 and MeCP2 antisera, a significant amount ofp15Ink4b DNA was found in the immunoprecipitated material as detected by PCR amplification. These data support the idea that MBD2 and MeCP2 may be responsible for methylation of genes that control cell growth including H-rev107 and p15Ink4bin WEHI 7.1 cells. Next, we analyzed the H-rev107 promoter occupancy by MeCP2 and MBD2 after treating WEHI 7.1 cells with 5-aza-dC. Exposure to this drug significantly reduced MeCP2/MBD2 binding to the 5′-region to non-detectable levels (Fig. 6C). As a control, we examined MeCP2/MBD2 binding to the abundantly expressed gene fatty acid synthase (exon 32). As expected, we did not detect any MeCP2/MBD2 antibody-specific binding to this gene in either untreated or azacytidine-treated cells"

The mutational analysis of the protein revealed two functional domains coded for by the first exon of tat and required for the optimal activation of viral gene transcription: the activation domain extending from the N terminus to residue 48 and the arginine-rich RNA binding motif from residues 49 to 58, which also encompasses a nuclear localization signal (14Ruben S.

The transcription activation domain functions as a typical eukaryotic domain as demonstrated by swapping experiments where the Tat-(1–49) region was fused to the DNA-binding domain of heterologous proteins (19Southgate C.D.

Three functional domains can be identified in the Tat-(1–49) region: the acidic activation domain (residues 1–21) and the cysteine-rich region (residues 22–31), which together with the conserved core region are involved in the in vitro formation of Tat-linked metal dimers and Tat protein interactions in vivo (21Siderovski D.P.

Moreover, Tat binds to cyclin T and recruits CDK9 to increase the processivity of RNA polymerase II (12Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

The second exon of tat codes for the C terminus of the protein and appears to mediate a large array of cellular activities by interacting with several cell surface receptors including integrin receptors (33Brake D.A. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), vascular endothelial growth factor, and chemokine receptors (34Albini A. Soldi R.

Tat protein may be directly involved in the development of some AIDS-related diseases by interfering with cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (36Ensoli B. Barillari G. Gallo R.C. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In fact, Tat deregulates the expression of several genes including proto-oncogenes and genes encoding for metabolic enzymes, cytokines, and cytokine receptors (36Ensoli B. Barillari G. Gallo R.C. Immunol. Rev. 1992; 127: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Scala G. Ruocco M.R. Ambrosino C. Mallardo M. Giordano V. Baldassarre F. Dragonetti E. Quinto I. Venuta S. J. Exp.

The above evidence points to Tat as an adaptor protein that affects the expression of viral and cellular genes by associating with cellular proteins. In this regard, the complex role of Tat in the establishment and progression of HIV-1 infection indicates that the yet unknown cellular partners of Tat remain to be identified. To this end, we took advantage of the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cellular proteins interacting with HIV-1 Tat. Among the identified Tat-binding proteins, E2F-4, a member of the E2F transcription factor family, was selected for further studies. The family of E2F transcription factors forms heterodimers with pRb and DP (differentiation regulated transcription factor 1 protein) family proteins resulting in DNA-binding complexes (39Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 40Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). E2F proteins share a conserved DNA-binding domain and an acidic transcriptional activation domain, which includes the “pocket proteins” binding site. E2F proteins share a similar structural organization with minor modifications: a N terminus region, which includes the DNA-binding domain, followed by the dimerization domain and the transcriptional activation domain located at the C terminus (41Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).

In addition, the investigation of E2F·pRb complexes is made difficult by the capacity of Rb proteins to substitute for each other (56Allen K.E. de la Luna S. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R.

The above evidence points to E2F-4 as a major mediator E2F cellular activity. In this work, we provide evidence that Tat physically associates to E2F-4 in vitro as well as in vivo. The resulting Tat·E2F-4 complexes enhance the transcriptional activity of E2F-driven promoters, indicating that Tat recruits E2F-4 to exert multiple biological activities. The yeast plasmids expressing the wild-type and mutated HIV-1 Tat proteins fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–117) were constructed by cloning thetat cDNA fragments into the NdeI site (Klenow-filled) of pAS2 plasmid. The DNA fragments coding for either the wild-type Tat protein (amino acids 2–86) or the activation domain of Tat (amino acids 2–49) or the basic region of Tat (amino acids 49–86) were recovered from pAS-Tat plasmids (a kind gift of B. Cullen) by EcoR1/XhoI digestion and were inserted into pAS2. pACTE2F-4-(1–481) was constructed by cloning the E2F-4 wild type cDNA downstream of the GAL4 activation domain in pACT vector. The E2F-4 cDNA was obtained by PCR using the pCDNA3-E2F-4 plasmid (provided by A. Giordano) as a template for the following primers: 5′-CGCGGATCCCGCGGAGGCCGGG-3′ (5′ primer) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTGAGAGGTTGAGAACAGGCAG-3′ (3′ primer). The PCR fragment was digested with BamH1 and cloned in the BamH1 site of pACT. The DNA fragments coding for the 3′-truncated forms of E2F-4 were obtained by PCR using the following 3′ primers: 5′-CGGCCTCGAGTCACAGGTGAATCTGGTACTTC-3′ in the case of E2F-4-(1–184) and 5′-CGGCTCGAGTCACCAAAACATTGGTAATGTCGTAAATCCG-3′ for E2F-4-(1–68). The PCR fragments were digested withBamH1/XhoI and cloned in the compatible sites of pACT. The correct sequence of the cDNA fragments was analyzed by sequencing (Sequenase Version 2, Amersham Biosciences). The expression of the fusion proteins was verified by Western blot by using antibodies specific for either the GAL4 DNA-binding domain or the GAL4 activation domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). pGEX-Tat plasmid was a gift of M. Giacca. Mammalian plasmids expressing either the wild type Tat, pCMVTat-(1–86), or the mutant forms of the viral protein, namely pCMVTat-(1–21) and pCMVTat-(1–49), were constructed by cloning the respective PCR fragments in pRC-CMV vector. The PCR was performed with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CGGGGTACCATGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAG-3′ as 5′ primer; 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCCTTAGGCATCTCC-3′ as 3′ primer in the case of Tat-(1–86); 5′-CTATCCCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTCCTAGCAGTTTTAGGCAGACAACC-3′ for Tat-(1–21); and 5′-CTATCCCTGTCTCCGCTTCTTCCTCCTGCCATAGGAGATCG-3′ as 3′ primer for Tat-(1–49). The above 3′ primers included the nuclear localization signals (bold nucleotides) and the stop codon. The PCR fragments were subcloned in BKS (Stratagene) and recovered by KpnI/BamH1 digestion. The purified fragments were cloned in pRC-CMV digested with the same enzymes. pCMV-5′-FLAG-Tat-(1–86) was obtained by cloning the FLAG-Tat fragment previously digested with KpnI/BamH1 in the compatible sites of pRC-CMV. The FLAG epitope (bold sequence) recognized by the M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was inserted in-frame upstream of the Tat coding sequence by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CGGGGTACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGAGCCAGTAGATCCTAGACTA-3′ (5′ primer) and the above reported 3′ primer for Tat-(1–86). To obtain pCMVTat-(1–49), the cDNA coding for residues 1–49 of Tat was amplified by using the primers 5′-CCGGAATTCAGAGCCAGTAGATCTTAGACTA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGCCATAGGAGATGCCTAAG-3′ followed byEcoRI-Xba digestion and insertion into the corresponding sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). The HIV-1 Tat expression vectors pSVT8 and pSVT10 carrying the tat gene cloned downstream of the SV40 promoter in sense or antisense orientation, respectively, were provided by A. Caputo. The reporter plasmids pWTcat carrying the HIV-1 promoter from −644 to +78 bp cloned upstream to the cat gene, pTARcat carrying mutations abolishing the Tar structure, and pNFAcat carrying mutations of the two NFκB sites were obtained by A. Rabson (62Leonard J. Parrott C. Buckler-White A.J. Turner W. Ross E.K. Martin M.A. Rabson A.B. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCD23 plasmid harboring the HIV-1 promoter sequence from −117 to +80 bp and pCD52 lacking the two NFκB sites were obtained from the AIDS Reference and Reagents Program. In pCD23ΔTar, the Tar region was functionally deleted as described previously (63Mallardo M. Dragonetti E. Baldassarre F. Ambrosino C. Scala G. Quinto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). pBLTK/E2F-cat and pBLTK/E2FM-cat were prepared by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to two copies of either wild type or mutant E2F binding site upstream of the TK promoter in the SalI site of pBLCAT2. The following oligonucleotides corresponding to the E2F binding site of the promoter of the adenovirus E2 gene were utilized: 5′-GATCCACTAGTTTCGCGCGTTTCTACACTATTTCGCGCGC-3′ (wild type sequence) and 5′-GATCCACTAGTTTACTCAGATAACTACACTATTTACTCAGATAACTATCGA-3′ (mutant oligonucleotides, mutated basis are in bold). Y190 and Y187 yeast strains were described previously (64Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar). For the library screening, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y190 was grown in selective minimal medium containing 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (20 g/liter glucose, 1× amino acid mixture lacking uracil and lysine, 5 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 20 g/liter Bacto-agar (Difco). For yeast transformation, a yeast culture from a single colony was diluted and grown overnight at 30 °C. The day after, the yeast culture (300 ml) was diluted at A600 = 0.2 and grown to A600 = 0.5. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g and resuspended in 1.5 ml of lithium acetate-TE buffer (100 mmlithium acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in agitation. For each transformation, 20 μg of library DNA were mixed with 5 μg of pASTAT-(2–86) and 175 μg of carrier DNA previously boiled and chilled on ice. 200 μl of yeast suspension were added to each DNA mix in the presence of 1.3 ml of polyethylene glycol solution (40% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm lithium acetate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA) freshly prepared. After incubation at 30 °C for 45 min, the mixture of yeast and DNA was heat-shocked at 42 °C for 15 min, resuspended in 5 ml of synthetic complete medium, and grown for 5 h at 30 °C. The yeast cultures then were harvested and plated on a larger plate containing selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine plus 25 mm 3-amino-triazole (Sigma). The plates were incubated at 30 °C, and the colonies grown after 3–5 days were tested for β-galactosidase activity by filter assay. To this end, 45-nm nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) were laid onto the plates that were incubated at 30 °C overnight. The day after, the filters were lifted and placed at −80 °C for 1 h and laid onto 3-mm chromatography paper soaked with buffer Z containing 1 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, INALCO). Blue colonies were picked and grown on selective medium lacking leucine plus 5 μg/ml cycloheximide to induce the pAS-Tat-(2–86) plasmid expulsion. A single colony for each yeast clone was grown in liquid synthetic medium lacking leucine plus cycloheximide, and 200 μl of this culture were mixed with 40 μl of Y187 stably carrying pACT-laminin or pACT-SNF1. The mixed yeast cultures were incubated at 30 °C onto a nitrocellulose filter laid on a complete medium plate. After a 4-h incubation, the filters were recovered, and diploid cells were identified by plating on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine. The grown colonies were screened for β-galactosidase expression by filter assay. To recover the library plasmids from yeast, positive yeast clones were grown in synthetic medium minus leucine until saturation, harvested, washed, and lysed in breaking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) with glass beads (Sigma) and an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. The DNA was purified and introduced in Escherichia coli DH5α by electroporation (Bio-Rad apparatus). Two-hybrid assays were performed with purified plasmids by using a similar transformation procedure using 5 μg of each of the tested plasmids. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics as reported previously (65Liu W. Quinto I. Chen X. Palmieri C. Rabin R.L. Schwartz O.M. Nelson D.L. Scala G. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, 4 × 106 cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 20% fetal calf serum and subjected to a double electrical pulse at 200 V, 960 microfarads by a Bio-Rad apparatus (66Scala G.

Each assay contains 15 μg of cell extracts, 30 μl of 4 mm acetyl-coenzyme A (Sigma), 0.5 μCi ofd-threo-1,2-[14C]chloramphenicol (AmershamBiosciences) in a final volume of 150 μl of 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 7.8. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, extracted with ethyl acetate, dried, and spotted on Polygram Sil G silica gel plates (Macherey-Nagel). The plates then were run in a thin layer chromatography tank containing a mixture of chloroform:methanol (95:5). Following autoradiography, the thin layer chromatography spots were counted in a Beckman LS5000TD scintillation counter. For in vitrointeraction studies, GST and GST-Tat proteins were produced and purified as described previously (29Ambrosino C. Ruocco M.R. Chen X. Mallardo M. Baudi F. Trematerra S. Quinto I. Venuta S.

For protein interaction, 5 μg of purified GST and GST-Tat proteins were incubated with 400 μg of whole cellular extracts in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.4 m KCl, 25% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C on a rocking platform, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated in binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added to the samples and left under agitation in a cold room for 2 h.

Some of these families are expressed in very small amounts, in the order of a few picomoles/109 APC. We detected these peptides from an extract of class II MHC molecules by using monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies to capture the MHC-bound peptides prior to their examination by HPLC tandem mass spectrometry. Here, we have identified several members of a family of peptides encompassing residues 20–35, which represent less than 1% of the total HEL peptides. Binding analysis indicated that the core segment of the family was represented by residues 24–32 (SLGNWVCAA). Asn-27 (shown in boldface) is the main MHC-binding residue, mapped as interacting with the P4 pocket of the I-Ak molecule.

It requires, therefore, the identification and quantification of the peptides that are selected by the class II MHC1 molecules of the antigen-presenting cells (APC). There are two major difficulties with the identification of the class II MHC-bound peptides. The first is that peptides are selected as families, which comprise many members; a family is characterized by having a core sequence that interacts with the P1 to P9 anchoring sites of the MHC binding groove and flanking residues (1Chicz R.M.

The flanking residues vary greatly in length and determine the number of members in a family. The flanking residues contribute to the affinity of binding to class II molecules and to the half-life of the peptide-MHC complex on the surface of APC (7Latek R.R. Unanue E.R. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Suri A. Vidavsky I. van der Drift K. Kanagawa O. Gross M.L. Unanue E.R. J.

Additionally, flanking residues can have a marked effect on the T cell recognition (11Carson R.T. Vignali K.M. Woodland D.L. Vignali D.A. Immunity. 1997; 7: 387-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Vignali D.A. Strominger J.L. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The length of the peptides and their size heterogeneity, however, make it difficult to purify them for analysis as well as to predict binding motifs. A second difficulty with the analysis of class II-bound peptides is that their amounts vary greatly among the various families, by as much as 250-fold (13Velazquez C. DiPaolo R. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5488-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of these heterogeneous peptide families is particularly difficult.Studying the HEL protein as an antigen, we identified most of the segments selected for presentation by the I-Ak molecule (14Peterson D.A. DiPaolo R.J. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Most of the HEL-specific T cell response was directed to the HEL epitopes: HEL-(18–33), HEL-(31–47), HEL-(48–63), and HEL-(115–129) (14Peterson D.A. DiPaolo R.J. Kanagawa O. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1999; 11: 453-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we identified the naturally processed peptides of the HEL-(48–63) family (DGSTDYGILQINSRWW) (4Nelson C.A. Roof R.W. McCourt D.W. Unanue E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7380-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the most abundant epitope, occupying up to 10–20% of the total class II MHC molecules (15Dadaglio G. Nelson C.A. Deck M.B. Petzold S.J. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1997; 6: 727-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, we had to develop a peptide immunoaffinity capture technique to isolate and characterize the lower abundance HEL peptide families (3Gugasyan R. Vidavsky I. Nelson C.A. Gross M.L. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6074-6081PubMed Google Scholar). This approach consisted of purifying and concentrating the HEL peptides from a class II MHC peptide extract by using an anti-HEL peptide-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) followed by their identification by HPLC/electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). This method allowed the identification and quantification of the HEL-(31–47 peptide family (AAKFESNFNTQATNRNT) (3Gugasyan R. Vidavsky I. Nelson C.A. Gross M.L. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6074-6081PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-HEL peptide-specific antibodies were also used by applying ELISA methods to quantitate the peptides in the class II MHC peptide extract (13Velazquez C. DiPaolo R. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5488-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).In this article we report our studies of a second HEL peptide family that stimulates T cells, although it is represented in very low amounts on the APC class II molecules, i.e. ∼100 copies of 20–35-mer peptide/105 I-Ak molecules (13Velazquez C. DiPaolo R. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5488-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite the 20–35 family occurring in extremely small amounts, we were able to characterize five members by using the antipeptide capture technique.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo isolate and quantify the naturally processed forms of the HEL-(18–33) epitope, we used the 15B7–1B5 specific to the HEL peptide sequence from residues 18–33: DNYRGYSLGN-WVCAAK (13Velazquez C. DiPaolo R. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5488-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This mAb recognizes the HEL-(18–33) peptide both in solution and bound to an ELISA plate and had been used to determine the abundance of this HEL peptide on I-Ak molecules isolated from an APC line that expresses a membrane form of HEL, M12-AkmHEL. The HEL-(18–33) epitope (13Velazquez C. DiPaolo R. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5488-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was expressed in low abundance on the M12-AkmHEL APC, i.e. about 9 pmol of peptide/5.6 × 106 APC. In this study, we isolated the natural sequence, represented mostly by the 20–35 peptide, and identified the amino acid residues responsible for anchoring the peptide to the I-Ak molecules as well as those residues that interact with the T cell receptor (TCR). We call attention to the finding that the peptide was found sulfated, but this change took place following its isolation.Identification of Naturally Processed Forms of the HEL-(18–33) EpitopeWe first extracted all of the peptides bound to class II molecule I-Ak of the M12.Ak mHEL line. Then the members of the HEL-(18–33) peptide family were isolated and concentrated by immunoaffinity chromatography using the 15B7–1B5 mAb specific to the peptide-(18–33). The eluted peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In the mass chromatogram of the purified peptides, we observed several peptides eluting at retention times between 28 and 30 min. The molecular ions were doubly charged ions [M + 2H]2+ with an m/z of 932.5, 990.0, and 1047.1. These corresponded to the peptides HEL-(20–35) (YRGYSLGNWVCAAKFE), HEL-(19–35) (NYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFE), and HEL-(18–35) (DNYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFE), respectively (Fig.1). The most abundant member of this HEL family was peptide-(20–35). The amino acid sequence of the HEL-(20–35) peptide was determined by MS/MS analysis; a search conducted in the protein sequence data base, using the SEQUEST program, identified this sequence as corresponding to the HEL peptide.In addition to these HEL peptide masses, we observed three doubly charged ions with 40 m/z units higher that the HEL peptides and with identical retention times. Them/z values of these ions were 972.52+, 1030.52+, and 1087.52+(Fig. 1). This m/z difference indicates that the HEL peptides were likely post-translationally modified by either a phosphate or sulfate group, either of which would add a mass of 80 Da to the peptide or protein (for doubly charged ions these modifications change the m/z of peptides by 40). Although we used larger m/z mass ranges for many of our experiments (i.e. m/z 700–1400) than that shown in Fig. 1, we found no signals of greater intensity than those of the putative sulfated peptides and the peptides themselves.The HEL-(20–35) Epitope Is Modified by a Sulfate GroupThe amino acid sequence of the HEL-(20–35) epitope (YRGYSLGNWVCAAKFE) contains three potential residues to be modified: the tyrosines at positions 20 and 23, which could be modified by either sulfation or phosphorylation, and a serine residue at position 24, which could be phosphorylated. We ruled out the phosphorylation at serine 24 as a possible modification because the recognition of the anti-HEL-(18–33) mAb (15B7–1B5) used to isolate this HEL peptide family depends on an unmodified serine 24 (data not shown). Therefore, the only two possible modification sites on the HEL-(20–35) epitope are the two tyrosine residues at positions 20 and 23.To identify the nature of the modification present on the naturally processed HEL-(20–35) epitope, we isolated from the M12-AkmHEL line the HEL-(20–35) peptide family. The most abundant member of this family (HEL-(20–35) peptide) was submitted to CID in the ion trap. The resulting product-ion spectrum was compared with those of synthetic sulfated or phosphorylated HEL-(20–35) peptides. The product-ion spectra of the naturally processed HEL peptide and the synthetic modified peptides are very similar (Fig.2). In contrast, the CID spectrum of the synthetic phosphorylated HEL-(20–35) peptide is significantly different. This observation strongly indicates that the HEL-(20–35) peptide isolated from APC was sulfated (not phosphorylated) on tyrosine. In subsequent MS experiments, we identified the tyrosine at position 23 as the amino acid modified by the sulfate group. Synthetic peptides with sulfated tyrosine at either residue 20 or 23 were added to the natural peptide and submitted for analysis; the addition of the Tyr-20 sulfated peptide resulted in two peaks (retention times of 28.6 and 29.5 min) that were base line-resolved, whereas addition of the Tyr-23 sulfated peptide only yielded one peak (29.5 min).Figure 2The naturally processed HEL -(20–35) peptide is modified by a sulfated group. A, naturally processed HEL-(20–35) peptide family was isolated from M12-Ak mHEL APC, and the HEL-(20–35) peptide (the most abundant member of this family) was submitted to CID in the Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. The resulting product ion spectrum was compared with the CID spectra obtained with synthetically sulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide at position 23 (B) and with synthetically phosphorylated HEL-(20–35) peptide at position 23 (C). Note that the CID spectra of the naturally processed HEL peptide and the synthetically sulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide are very similar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, when we analyzed the mass spectrum of the synthetic HEL-(20–35) peptide that was sulfated at Tyr-23, we observed two ions with m/z values of 932.52+ and 972.52+. Those m/z values correspond to the unsulfated and sulfated forms of the HEL-(20–35) peptide, respectively. This facile loss of sulfur trioxide that accompanies electrospray ionization of a sulfated peptide was described previously (23Nemeth-Cawley J.F. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Severs J.C. Carnine M. Eguizabal H. Mock K.K. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and it is due to the weak bond between the sulfate group and peptide (25Rappsilber J. Steen H. Mann M. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the thermochemical stability of SO3. Furthermore, there were a considerable number of fragment ions generated in the CID of the synthetic phosphorylated peptide, which were not present either in the product-ion spectrum of the naturally processed peptides or in that of the synthetically sulfated peptides (Fig. 2). The loss of SO3 from sulfated peptides occurs so readily that the typical fragmentation of the peptide chain to give b and y ions, for example, is not competitive. The stronger linkage to phosphate, however, allows the other fragmentations to compete with the loss of the phosphate group. Others have pointed out this contrast between sulfated and phosphorylated peptides (23Nemeth-Cawley J.F. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 1301-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 24Severs J.C. Carnine M. Eguizabal H. Mock K.K. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25Rappsilber J. Steen H. Mann M. J. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 36: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the difference appears to be general.The loss of 98 atomic mass units (either H3PO4 or HPO3 and H2O) that is observed for the phosphorylated standard is often viewed as difficult or impossible from peptides that contain phosphorylated Tyr, as exemplified in a recent report (26Zhou H. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is ample precedent for this loss from singly charged phosphopeptides, beginning with some of the earliest reports of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)/MS of these materials (27McLachlin D.T. Chait B.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 28Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3413-3421Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 29Qin J. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 402-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The precedent that is most relevant to our observations is that reported by DeGnore and Qin (30DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), who showed that doubly charged 20-mer peptides phosphorylated on Tyr can lose 98 Da in CID to produce abundant product ions. It is likely that the loss takes place in two steps, the first being that of HPO3 and the second that of H2O. This loss of 98 Da, however, is not general for peptides that contain phosphotyrosine, and the rules governing its occurrence are not known.We emphasize that the mass spectrum of the naturally processed HEL-(20–35) peptide family also showed the sulfated and unsulfated versions of the HEL-(20–35), HEL-(19–35), and HEL-(18–35) peptides (Fig. 1). All of these sulfated and unsulfated forms showed identical retention times in the HPLC preceding the MS, indicating that the signal for the unsulfated HEL peptides in this mass spectrum was because of the loss of the sulfur trioxide from the sulfated peptide during the ionization process in the mass spectrometer and not the presence of both sulfated and unsulfated HEL peptides in the original sample.In subsequent MS experiments, we showed that the peptide remaining after loss of SO3 is indeed HEL-(20–35) by comparing its product-ion spectrum (MS/MS) with that of the unknown. The spectrum of the synthetic standard HEL-(20–35) gave an abundant but incomplete series of b ions and a less abundant and incomplete series of y ions (relative abundance is shown in parentheses):b 152+ (100%),b 14 (5%), b 13 (55%),b 12 (20%), b 11 (15%),b 10 (35%), b 9 (15%),b 6 (10%), b 5 (5%), andb 4 (5%); y 14 (5%),y 10 (5%), y 9 (2%),y 8 (5%), y 6 (15%), andy 4 (5%).The naturally processed peptide, which we found in lesser quantities than the standard, gave a spectrum that agrees well with that of the standard (nd indicates “not detected'):b 152+ (100%),b 14 (5%), b 13 (35%),b 12 (20%), b 11 (10%),b 10 (20%), b 9 (10%),b 6 (nd), b 5 (nd), andb 4 (nd); y 14 (3%),y 10 (5%), y 9 (nd),y 8 (nd), y 6 (10%), andy 4 (nd).Some of the low abundance ions could not be detected because the (chemical) noise level in certain m/z regions of the naturally processed species' spectra was poorer than that of the standard. Nevertheless, the agreement between spectra and the sequence coverage add confidence that the naturally processed peptide is sulfated HEL-(10–35).In experiments not shown, we also examined HEL peptides from the M12.C3.F6 line cultured in the presence of exogenous HEL. We identified HEL-(20–35), HEL-(19–35), and HEL-(18–35) as observed in the M12.Ak mHEL APCs experiment (Fig. 1). The most abundant member of this HEL peptide family was the peptide HEL-(20–35). We also identified peptide-(20–36) and -(20–37) but in lesser abundance. All of the HEL peptides carried a post-translational modification of 80 atomic mass units, as indicated by the two signals separated by 40 m/z in the mass spectra.Tyrosine Sulfation of the HEL-(20–35) Epitope is an Artifact Generated during the Peptide Isolation ProcedureTyrosine sulfation is a post-translational modification of secretory, plasma membrane, and lysosomal proteins occurring in all multicellular eukaryotic organisms (31Huttner, W. B., and Bauerle, P. A. (1988) in Modern Cell Biology (Satir, B., ed) Vol. 6, pp. 97–121, New York.Google Scholar, 32Huttner W.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This modification is catalyzed by the TPST, an integral membrane glycoprotein residing in the trans-Golgi network (33Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). TPST uses PAPS as the sulfate donor in the sulfate transfer reaction. Based on the Trans-Golgi localization of TPST, we were surprised by the isolation of sulfated HEL peptides from APC fed with exogenous HEL protein. Therefore, we evaluated whether the tyrosine sulfation of this HEL peptide was occurring physiologically or was generated during the peptide isolation procedure. We formedin vitro the unsulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide·I-Ak complex. When the 20–35 peptide was isolated from this complex and examined by MS, we found the correct mass of the unsulfated peptide to be 932.92+ (Fig.3 A). We next added the complex into a control M12-Ak cellular lysate, at the cell equivalent concentration used to obtain the previous results. The mass spectrum of the recovered HEL peptide showed the expected mass ion for the sulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide, m/z of 972.5 (Fig. 3 B). The presence of sulfate group in the HEL peptide was confirmed by MS/MS analysis. Indeed, other studies using radioactive PAPS to evaluate the TPST activity in the M12-Ak cellular lysate indicated the presence of such activity in the extract (Fig. 4). (We also examined, using HPLC/MS, whether the HEL protein isolated from the APCs M12-Ak mHEL or from M12-Ak fed with exogenous HEL was sulfated on tyrosine residues. We did not find any evidence of sulfation on either or both protein samples, indicating that under physiological conditions in APC, the HEL protein was not sulfated.)Figure 3Tyrosine sulfation of the HEL -(20–35) epitope is generated during the peptide isolation procedure.Unsulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide·I-Ak complex was generated in vitro and added into a control M12-Ak cellular lysate.

The TPST activity in the cellular M12-Ak lysate was measured using the EAY polymer (poly(Glu-Ala-Tyr)) as a substrate for TPST. EAY (100 μm) was incubated with 10 μl of M12-Ak cellular lysate (5 × 108 cell equivalent/ml of solubilization buffer) in the presence of radioactive [35S]PAPS (20 μm) and cold PAP (100 μm). The total volume of the assay mixture was 100 μm). The total volume of the assay mixture was 100 μl. The TPST activity is represented as the incorporated radioactivity in dpm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we generated a panel of T cell hybridomas that specifically recognize sulfated peptide. These T hybridomas, developed by immunizing mice with sulfated HEL-(20–35) peptide, were selected in vitro for reactivity to the sulfated HEL peptide. We used these T hybridomas as a read-out system to evaluate whether the sulfated HEL peptides were presented on APC. None of these T cells reacted with APC cultured in HEL or in APCs, which express the HEL protein as a membrane-bound protein, confirming that under physiological conditions epitope-(20–35) was not sulfated. Thus, the tyrosine sulfation of the HEL-(20–35) family of peptides was generated during the peptide isolation procedure, resulting from the presence of TPST in the extract.Binding StudiesThe binding of the most abundant peptide, HEL-(20–35), to I-Ak molecules was tested. In 17 different experiments, the IC50 averaged 1.4 μm. Although the degree of binding varied about 30% depending on the preparation, it was highly consistent within experiments in which various mutant peptides were tested. Fig.5 summarizes experiments testing HEL-(20–35) peptide in which several residues were changed to alanines in order to see the effects on MHC binding. Notably, changing Asn-27 to Ala resulted in a drop in binding of 200%, an average from six different experiments. No other amino acid when changed to alanine reduced binding significantly. However, a change of Cys-30 to Ala increased binding by 72%.Figure 5Analysis of the binding of Ala-substituted HEL -(20–35) peptide to I-Ak molecules. Several residues of the HEL-(20–35) peptide were substituted to alanines, and the IC50 was estimated. The effect of the Ala substitution on HEL-(20–35) peptide binding is represented as the % of increase or % of reduction of peptide binding with respect to the HEL-(20–35) peptide. The graph summarizes the results of 4–8 experiments for each substitution.

Monnaie D. Nelson C.A. Hendrickson W.A. Unanue E.R. Immunity. 1998; 8: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The central or core sequence occupied the stretch from P1 to P9. An acidic residue at P1, Asp-52, was favored for strong binding as well as for peptide selection. At P4, small hydrophobic residues or asparagines were favored. As with most MHC-displayed peptides, amino acids that contacted the TCR were positioned at P2, P5, and P9.Extrapolating this information to peptide-(20–35), we mapped the P1 to P9 stretch to residues 24–32 (Tables Iand II). As will be noted below, changing Leu-25 and Trp-28 to Ala did not affect binding but reduced entirely the T cell response; these two residues were TCR contact residues. In residues 24–32, Leu-25 is at P2, a TCR contact, Asn-27 at P4, the main MHC contact, and Trp-28 at P5, another TCR contact. P1 is occupied by Ser-24, contributing little to binding energy.Table IT cell contact residues of the HEL-(20–35) epitopeT cellY20AR21AG22 (ND)Y23AS24AL25AG26 (ND)N27AW28AV29AC30AAla-31Ala-32K33AF34AaThe T cell hybridomas tested were generated and selected using the HEL-(18–33) peptide.
