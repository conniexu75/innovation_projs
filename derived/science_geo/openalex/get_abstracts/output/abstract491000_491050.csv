https://openalex.org/W2124208385,"Designer Chromosome One of the ultimate aims of synthetic biology is to build designer organisms from the ground up. Rapid advances in DNA synthesis has allowed the assembly of complete bacterial genomes. Eukaryotic organisms, with their generally much larger and more complex genomes, present an additional challenge to synthetic biologists. Annaluru et al. (p. 55 , published online 27 March) designed a synthetic eukaryotic chromosome based on yeast chromosome III. The designer chromosome, shorn of destabilizing transfer RNA genes and transposons, is ∼14% smaller than its wild-type template and is fully functional with every gene tagged for easy removal."

We tested the hypothesis that a urine test measuring insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), both inducers of G1 cell cycle arrest, a key mechanism implicated in acute kidney injury (AKI), could predict AKI in cardiac surgery patients.We studied 50 patients at high risk for AKI undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Serial urine samples were analyzed for [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentrations. The primary outcome measure was AKI as defined by international consensus criteria following surgery. Furthermore, we investigated whether urine [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] could predict renal recovery from AKI prior to hospital discharge.26 patients (52%) developed AKI. Diagnosis based on serum creatinine and/or oliguria did not occur until 1-3 days after CPB. In contrast, urine concentration of [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] rose from a mean of 0.49 (SE 0.24) at baseline to 1.51 (SE 0.57) 4 h after CPB in patients who developed AKI. The maximum urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] concentration achieved in the first 24 hours following surgery (composite time point) demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.84. Sensitivity was 0.92, and specificity was 0.81 for a cutoff value of 0.50. The decline in urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] values was the strongest predictor for renal recovery.Urinary [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP7] serves as a sensitive and specific biomarker to predict AKI early after cardiac surgery and to predict renal recovery.www.germanctr.de/, DRKS-ID: DRKS00005062."

https://openalex.org/W2004322066,"Behavioral health risks are among the most serious and difficult to mitigate risks of confinement in space craft during long-duration space exploration missions. We report on behavioral and psychological reactions of a multinational crew of 6 healthy males confined in a 550 m(3) chamber for 520 days during the first Earth-based, high-fidelity simulated mission to Mars. Rest-activity of crewmembers was objectively measured throughout the mission with wrist-worn actigraphs. Once weekly throughout the mission crewmembers completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Profile of Moods State short form (POMS), conflict questionnaire, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-B), and series of visual analogue scales on stress and fatigue. We observed substantial inter-individual differences in the behavioral responses of crewmembers to the prolonged mission confinement and isolation. The crewmember with the highest average POMS total mood disturbance score throughout the mission also reported symptoms of depression in 93% of mission weeks, which reached mild-to-moderate levels in >10% of mission weeks. Conflicts with mission control were reported five times more often than conflicts among crewmembers. Two crewmembers who had the highest ratings of stress and physical exhaustion accounted for 85% of the perceived conflicts. One of them developed a persistent sleep onset insomnia with ratings of poor sleep quality, which resulted in chronic partial sleep deprivation, elevated ratings of daytime tiredness, and frequent deficits in behavioral alertness. Sleep-wake timing was altered in two other crewmembers, beginning in the first few months of the mission and persisting throughout. Two crewmembers showed neither behavioral disturbances nor reports of psychological distress during the 17-month period of mission confinement. These results highlight the importance of identifying behavioral, psychological, and biological markers of characteristics that predispose prospective crewmembers to both effective and ineffective behavioral reactions during the confinement of prolonged spaceflight, to inform crew selection, training, and individualized countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W2077706404,"Gasdermin B (GSDMB) belongs to the Gasdermin protein family that comprises four members (GSDMA-D). Gasdermin B expression has been detected in some tumor types such as hepatocarcinomas, gastric and cervix cancers; and its over-expression has been related to tumor progression. At least four splicing isoforms of GSDMB have been identified, which may play differential roles in cancer. However, the implication of GSDMB in carcinogenesis and tumor progression is not well understood. Here, we uncover for the first time the functional implication of GSDMB in breast cancer. Our data shows that high levels of GSDMB expression is correlated with reduced survival and increased metastasis in breast cancer patients included in an expression dataset (>1,000 cases). We demonstrate that GSDMB is upregulated in breast carcinomas compared to normal breast tissue, being the isoform 2 (GSDMB-2) the most differentially expressed. In order to evaluate the functional role of GSDMB in breast cancer two GSDMB isoforms were studied (GSDMB-1 and GSDMB-2). The overexpression of both isoforms in the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line promotes cell motility and invasion, while its silencing in HCC1954 breast carcinoma cells decreases the migratory and invasive phenotype. Importantly, we demonstrate that both isoforms have a differential role on the activation of Rac-1 and Cdc-42 Rho-GTPases. Moreover, our data support that GSMDB-2 induces a pro-tumorigenic and pro-metastatic behavior in mouse xenograft models as compared to GSDMB-1. Finally, we observed that although both GSDMB isoforms interact in vitro with the chaperone Hsp90, only the GSDMB-2 isoform relies on this chaperone for its stability. Taken together, our results provide for the first time evidences that GSDMB-2 induces invasion, tumor progression and metastasis in MCF7 cells and that GSDMB can be considered as a new potential prognostic marker in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2089245166,"All Together Now In quantum entanglement, correlations between particles mean that the measurement of one determines the outcome of the other(s). Generally, when trying to exploit quantum entanglement, the larger the number of entangled particles, the better. However, the size of entangled systems has been limited. Haas et al. (p. 180 , published online 27 March; see the Perspective by Widera ) prepared a small ensemble of ultracold atoms into a collective entangled state. Starting from one internal quantum state, the system of cold atoms was excited with a weak microwave pulse leading to a small excitation probability. Because it is not known which atom is promoted into the excited state, the detection of one quantum of excitation projects the system into an entangled quantum state, called a W-state. A fast repeat-until-success scheme produced such W-states quasi-deterministically. Using such a technique was able to yield entangled states of more than 40 particles. The relatively large ensemble-entangled states could potentially in the future find use in quantum sensing or enhanced quantum metrology applications."
https://openalex.org/W1994262406,"High resolution thermal infrared imaging is a pioneering method giving indices of sympathetic activity via the contact-free recording of facial tissues (thermal imprints). Compared to established stress markers, the great advantage of this method is its non-invasiveness. The goal of our study was to pilot the use of thermal infrared imaging in the classical setting of human stress research. Thermal imprints were compared to established stress markers (heart rate, heart rate variability, finger temperature, alpha-amylase and cortisol) in 15 participants undergoing anticipation, stress and recovery phases of two laboratory stress tests, the Cold Pressor Test and the Trier Social Stress Test. The majority of the thermal imprints proved to be change-sensitive in both tests. While correlations between the thermal imprints and established stress markers were mostly non-significant, the thermal imprints (but not the established stress makers) did correlate with stress-induced mood changes. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that in contrast to the established stress markers the thermal imprints could not disambiguate anticipation, stress and recovery phases of both tests. Overall, these results suggest that thermal infrared imaging is a valuable method for the estimation of sympathetic activity in the stress laboratory setting. The use of this non-invasive method may be particularly beneficial for covert recordings, in the study of special populations showing difficulties in complying with the standard instruments of data collection and in the domain of psychophysiological covariance research. Meanwhile, the established stress markers seem to be superior when it comes to the characterization of complex physiological states during the different phases of the stress cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2102205279,"Androgens have well-established anabolic actions on skeletal muscle, although the direct effects of the androgen receptor (AR) in muscle remain unclear. We generated satellite cell-specific AR-knockout (satARKO) mice in which the AR is selectively ablated in satellite cells, the muscle precursor cells. Total-limb maximal grip strength is decreased by 7% in satARKO mice, with soleus muscles containing ∼10% more type I fibers and 10% less type IIa fibers than the corresponding control littermates. The weight of the perineal levator ani muscle is markedly reduced (-52%). Thus, muscle AR is involved in fiber-type distribution and force production of the limb muscles, while it is a major determinant of the perineal muscle mass. Surprisingly, myostatin (Mstn), a strong inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth, is one of the most androgen-responsive genes (6-fold reduction in satARKO) through direct transcription activation by the AR. Consequently, muscle hypertrophy in response to androgens is augmented in Mstn-knockout mice. Our finding that androgens induce Mstn signaling to restrain their own anabolic actions has implications for the treatment of muscle wasting disorders.-Dubois, V., Laurent, M. R., Sinnesael, M., Cielen, N., Helsen, C., Clinckemalie, L., Spans, L., Gayan-Ramirez, G., Deldicque, L., Hespel, P., Carmeliet, G., Vanderschueren, D., and Claessens, F.

https://openalex.org/W2075808657,"We have recently shown that the non-coding RNA, steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA), functions as a transcriptional coactivator of PPARγ and promotes adipocyte differentiation in vitro. To assess SRA function in vivo, we have generated a whole mouse Sra1 gene knock-out (SRA(-/-)). Here, we show that the Sra1 gene is an important regulator of adipose tissue mass and function. SRA is expressed at a higher level in adipose tissue than other organs in wild type mice. SRA(-/-) mice are resistant to high fat diet-induced obesity, with decreased fat mass and increased lean content. This lean phenotype of SRA(-/-) mice is associated with decreased expression of a subset of adipocyte marker genes and reduced plasma TNFα levels. The SRA(-/-) mice are more insulin sensitive, as evidenced by reduced fasting insulin, and lower blood glucoses in response to IP glucose and insulin. In addition, the livers of SRA(-/-) mice have fewer lipid droplets after high fat diet feeding, and the expression of lipogenesis-associated genes is decreased. To our knowledge, these data are the first to indicate a functional role for SRA in adipose tissue biology and glucose homeostasis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1973698921,"A low-grade pro-inflammatory state is at the pathogenic core of obesity and type 2 diabetes. We tested the hypothesis that the plant terpenoid compound ginsenoside Rb1 (Rb1), known to exert anti-inflammatory effects, would ameliorate obesity, obesity-associated inflammation and glucose intolerance in the high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model. Furthermore, we examined the effect of Rb1 treatment on central leptin sensitivity and the leptin signaling pathway in the hypothalamus. We found that intraperitoneal injections of Rb1 (14 mg/kg, daily) for 21 days significantly reduced body weight gain, fat mass accumulation, and improved glucose tolerance in obese mice on a HF diet compared to vehicle treatment. Importantly, Rb1 treatment also reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and/or IL-1β) and NF-κB pathway molecules (p-IKK and p-IκBα) in adipose tissue and liver. In the hypothalamus, Rb1 treatment decreased the expression of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1β and p-IKK) and negative regulators of leptin signaling (SOCS3 and PTP1B). Furthermore, Rb1 treatment also restored the anorexic effect of leptin in high-fat fed mice as well as leptin pSTAT3 signaling in the hypothalamus. Ginsenoside Rb1 has potential for use as an anti-obesity therapeutic agent that modulates obesity-induced inflammation and improves central leptin sensitivity in HF diet-induced obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1990152773,"Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2045887831,"It is well known that mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate is critical for insulin secretion; however, we know little about how pyruvate is transported into mitochondria in β-cells. Part of the reason for this lack of knowledge is that the carrier gene was only discovered in 2012. In the current study, we assess the role of the recently identified carrier in the regulation of insulin secretion. Our studies show that β-cells express both mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (Mpc1 and Mpc2). Using both pharmacological inhibitors and siRNA-mediated knockdown of the MPCs we show that this carrier plays a key role in regulating insulin secretion in clonal 832/13 β-cells as well as rat and human islets. We also show that the MPC is an essential regulator of both the ATP-regulated potassium (KATP) channel-dependent and -independent pathways of insulin secretion. Inhibition of the MPC blocks the glucose-stimulated increase in two key signaling molecules involved in regulating insulin secretion, the ATP/ADP ratio and NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. The MPC also plays a role in in vivo glucose homeostasis as inhibition of MPC by the pharmacological inhibitor α-cyano-β-(1-phenylindol-3-yl)-acrylate (UK5099) resulted in impaired glucose tolerance. These studies clearly show that the newly identified mitochondrial pyruvate carrier sits at an important branching point in nutrient metabolism and that it is an essential regulator of insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2079499477,"Autoantibodies to nuclear antigens arise in human autoimmune diseases, but a unifying pathogenetic mechanism remains elusive. Recently we reported that exposure of neutrophils to inflammatory conditions induces the citrullination of core histones by peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) and that patients with autoimmune disorders produce autoantibodies that recognize such citrullinated histones. Here we identify histone H1 as an additional substrate of PAD4, localize H1 within neutrophil extracellular traps, and detect autoantibodies to citrullinated H1 in 6% of sera from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome. No preference for deiminated H1 was observed in healthy control sera and sera from patients with scleroderma or rheumatoid arthritis. We map binding to the winged helix of H1 and determine that citrulline 53 represents a key determinant of the autoantibody epitope. In addition, we quantitate RNA for H1 histone subtypes in mature human neutrophils and identify citrulline residues by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Our results indicate that deimination of linker histones generates new autoantibody epitopes with enhanced potential for stimulating autoreactive human B cells.—Dwivedi, N., Neeli, I., Schall, N., Wan, H., Desiderio, D.

https://openalex.org/W2103355669,"Effect alleles (alleles with a polymorphism that is associated with the effect being measured) in a small number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to influence the dietary requirement for choline. In this study, we examined a much larger number of SNPs (n=200) in 10 genes related to choline metabolism for associations with development of organ dysfunction (liver or muscle) when 79 humans were fed a low-choline diet. We confirmed that effect alleles in SNPs such as the C allele of PEMT rs12325817 increase the risk of developing organ dysfunction in women when they consume a diet low in choline, and we identified novel effect alleles, such as the C allele of CHKA SNP rs7928739, that alter dietary choline requirements. When fed a low-choline diet, some people presented with muscle damage rather than liver damage; several effect alleles in SLC44A1 (rs7873937, G allele; rs2771040, G; rs6479313, G; rs16924529, A; and rs3199966, C) and one in CHKB (rs1557502, A) were more common in these individuals. This suggests that pathways related to choline metabolism are more important for normal muscle function than previously thought. In European, Mexican, and Asian Americans, and in individuals of African descent, we examined the prevalence of the effect alleles in SNPs that alter choline requirement and found that they are differentially distributed among people of different ethnic and racial backgrounds. Overall, our study has identified novel genetic variants that modulate choline requirements and suggests that the dietary requirement for choline may be different across racial and ethnic groups.—Da Costa, K.-A., Corbin, K.

Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) has three SlSERK members. Two of them exhibit particularly high levels of sequence similarity to AtSERK3 and, therefore, were named SlSERK3A and SlSERK3B. To characterize a role for SlSERK3A and SlSERK3B in defense, we suppressed each gene individually or co-silenced both using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in the tomato cv. Moneymaker. Co-silencing SlSERK3A and SlSERK3B resulted in spontaneous necrotic lesions and reduced sensitivity to exogenous BR treatment. Silencing either SlSERK3A or SlSERK3B resulted in enhanced susceptibility to root knot-nematode and to non-pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000 hrcC indicating that both SlSERK3s are positive regulators of defense. Interestingly, silencing SlSERK3B, but not SlSERK3A, resulted in enhanced susceptibility to the pathogenic strain Pst DC3000 indicating distinct roles for these two SlSERK3 paralogs. SlSERK3A and SlSERK3B are active kinases, localized to the plasma membrane, and interact in vivo with the Flagellin Sensing 2 receptor in a flg22-dependent manner. Complementation of the Atserk3/bak1-4 mutant with either SlSERK3A or SlSERK3B partially rescued the mutant phenotype. Thus, SlSERK3A and SlSERK3B are likely to constitute tomato orthologs of BAK1."
https://openalex.org/W2086750189,"Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) molecular chaperones play critical roles in protein homeostasis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cytosolic Hsp70 interacts with up to three types of nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) homologous to human counterparts: Sse1/Sse2 (Heat shock protein 110 (Hsp110)), Fes1 (HspBP1), and Snl1 (Bag-1). All three NEFs stimulate ADP release; however, it is unclear why multiple distinct families have been maintained throughout eukaryotic evolution. In this study we investigate NEF roles in Hsp70 cell biology using an isogenic combinatorial collection of NEF deletion mutants. Utilizing well characterized model substrates, we find that Sse1 participates in most Hsp70-mediated processes and is of particular importance in protein biogenesis and degradation, whereas Fes1 contributes to a minimal extent. Surprisingly, disaggregation and resolubilization of thermally denatured firefly luciferase occurred independently of NEF activity. Simultaneous deletion of SSE1 and FES1 resulted in constitutive activation of heat shock protein expression mediated by the transcription factor Hsf1, suggesting that these two factors are important for modulating stress response. Fes1 was found to interact in vivo preferentially with the Ssa family of cytosolic Hsp70 and not the co-translational Ssb homolog, consistent with the lack of cold sensitivity and protein biogenesis phenotypes for fes1Δ cells.

Cellular viability relies on maintaining protein homeostasis (“proteostasis”), defined as a balance between polypeptide synthesis, transport, modification, and eventual degradation. Exposed hydrophobic regions of proteins resulting from incomplete or improper folding may cause deleterious intra- and intermolecular interactions in both nascent and extant proteins, leading to aggregation and loss of function (1Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). In humans, protein misfolding and aggregation have been associated with the formation of amyloid deposits common to many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington diseases (2Soto C.

In contrast to the highly conserved core domain architecture of J proteins, three NEF families distinct in both sequence and structure have been identified: Hsp110, HspBP1, and Bag domain-containing proteins (19Kabani M. Structural and functional diversity among eukaryotic Hsp70 nucleotide exchange factors.Protein Pept. Lett. 2009; 16: 623-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Hsp110 is represented by Sse1 and Sse2 in yeast and is a divergent relative of Hsp70, with an NBD and SBD, the latter domain lengthened by the presence of an extended linker between the SBDβ and SBDα subdomains. Hsp110 proteins bind Hsp70 with high affinity to form a functional heterodimer, with co-crystal structures indicating that the NBDs of Hsp70 and Hsp110 interact, whereas the extended linker region between SBDβ and SBDα allows the α-helical bundle to wrap around the NBD of Hsp70, leaving the Hsp110 β-sandwich domain exposed and in close proximity to the Hsp70 SBD (20Polier S.

Sse1 is the most abundant of all the NEFs at ∼70,000 molecules/cell, whereas Fes1 is present at approximately one-fifth the level of Sse1 and Snl1, and Sse2 levels are 15–20-fold lower than Sse1 (31Ghaemmaghami S.

Of the four NEF genes, only SSE2 is significantly induced by stress. Deletion of Sse1 results in slow growth and temperature sensitivity, and Hsp110 is essential in yeast because simultaneous deletion of both SSE1 and SSE2 is lethal (32Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H.

Functionally, Sse1 and Fes1 have both been shown to be involved in prion formation and curing, because Sse1 is required for [PSI+] propagation, and deletion of either SSE1 or FES1 blocks [URE3] propagation (35Fan Q.

Snl1 was recently shown to bind intact ribosomes via a polybasic region adjacent to the Hsp70-binding Bag domain, although the consequence of this association is not known (44Verghese J. Morano K.A. A lysine-rich region within fungal BAG domain-containing proteins mediates a novel association with ribosomes.Eukaryot. Cell. 2012; 11: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies, carried out in different strain backgrounds with different model clients, have contributed in a piecemeal fashion to understanding how the NEFs function individually, but how they are integrated into a comprehensive cellular proteostasis network is still unclear. Additionally, it is not known why Hsp70 NEF function has independently arisen at least three times, given that the relative rates of exchange measured in vitro are approximately equivalent. These are highly relevant considerations, given that human disorders are associated with NEF dysfunction. Marinesco-Sjøgren syndrome is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia caused by a mutation in Sil1 (BAP), an NEF for the ER-resident Hsp70 BiP (45Senderek J. Krieger M. Stendel C. Bergmann C.

Loss of Hsp110 is additionally associated with Tau pathology in a mouse model and huntingtin-related neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model (46Eroglu B. Moskophidis D. Mivechi N.F.

A genomewide RNA interference screen for modifiers of aggregates formation by mutant Huntingtin in Drosophila.Genetics. 2010; 184: 1165-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, we undertook a comprehensive genetic and cell biological analysis of cytosolic Hsp70 NEF functions to determine functional specificity. We report that deletion of SSE1 uniquely results in severe defects in Hsp70-mediated protein biogenesis and quality control, whereas surprisingly, NEFs are not required to assist in refolding of a model misfolded substrate. Deletion of both major soluble NEFs results in constitutive derepression of the heat shock transcription factor Hsf1, consistent with a role for Sse1 and Fes1 in governing cellular responses to stress through Hsp70. We find that Fes1 associates with the general Hsp70 Ssa1/2, but not the co-translational Hsp70 Ssb1/2 in vivo, in contrast to Sse1, which binds both, providing a possible driver of functional specificity. These findings, along with the absence of consequences for deletion of SSE2 or SNL1, led us to conclude that Hsp110 may be the principal NEF in yeast and possibly higher eukaryotic cells. All strains are isogenic to BY4741 and are listed in Table 1. Construction of deletion strains was done by generating deletion cassettes in pBluescript II carrying the marker genes KANMX4, LEU2, or HIS3 flanked by upstream and downstream noncoding regions of SSE1, SSE2, FES1, and SNL1. To facilitate analysis of protein biogenesis and refolding, plasmid p425MET25-FFL-GFP (a kind gift of J. Glover, University of Toronto) expressing firefly luciferase fused to GFP was modified as follows (48Tkach J.M. Glover J.R. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of the molecular chaperone Hsp104 in unstressed and heat-shocked cells.Traffic. 2008; 9: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The URA3 gene was amplified from pRS426 using oligonucleotides containing homologous 5′ and 3′ regions of the LEU2 gene (49Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. A system of shuttle vectors and yeast host strains designed for efficient manipulation of DNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leu2::URA3::leu2 amplicon was co-transformed with p425MET25-FFL-GFP into BY4741 cells, selecting for Ura+ Leu− transformants arising through homologous recombination. The modified plasmid was rescued into Escherichia coli, purified and verified by sequencing. The p425MET25-FFL-GFP-leu2::URA3 construct was transformed into NEF deletion strains using the rapid yeast transformation protocol (50Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Improved method for high efficiency transformation of intact yeast cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar).

For immunoprecipitation analyses, yeast cells were transformed with either p413TEF-FLAG-SSE1 or p413TEF-FLAG-FES1, which were constructed by standard subcloning procedures from p414TEF-FLAG-SSE1 and p414TEF-FLAG-FES1, respectively using SpeI/XhoI restriction sites into the 413TEF vector (44Verghese J.

Cells were then subcultured to midlog phase A600 = 0.5–1.0. For NEF deletion strain growth analysis, cultures were diluted to A600 = 1.0, and 1:10 dilutions were made and spotted on YPD plates. To identify growth phenotypes in both optimal and stress-inducing growth conditions, plated cells were incubated at 15, 25, 30, and 37 °C for up to 5 days. To test azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) toxicity, strains were grown overnight, and 1:10 dilutions were plated on SC medium or SC + 2 mm AZC and incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days. For de novo folding analyses, NEF deletion strains containing p425MET25-FFL-GFP-leu2::URA3 were grown overnight in SC-URA medium containing 200 μm additional methionine (methionine represses expression of FFL-GFP under the MET25 promoter), subcultured in the same medium, grown to early log phase (A600 = 0.4–0.5), and then induced in SC-URA-MET medium. Refolding assays were performed using NEF deletion strains containing p425MET25-FFL-GFP-leu2::URA3 grown overnight in SC-URA and subcultured to mid-log phase A600 = 0.8–1.0. Cells were induced in SC-URA-MET for 1 h at 30 °C. Prior to heat shock, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide, incubated at 42 °C for 25 min, and recovered for 60 min at 30 °C. For degradation analysis, log phase cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. To control for strain effects on folding of GFP, cells were transformed with p316CUP1-GFP. For all strains, cells in logarithmic phase growth were treated with 50 μm CuSO4 for 1 h to induce GFP expression prior to microscopy. Cells were collected and visualized using an Olympus IX81-ZDC inverted microscope as described previously (53Abrams J.L. Morano K.A. Coupled assays for monitoring protein refolding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Vis. Exp. 2013; 2013: e50432Google Scholar). To test steady state protein solubility, log phase cells bearing p425MET25-FFL-GFP-leu2::URA3 were visualized without induction or repression. For refolding analysis, samples were collected prior to heat shock, immediately following heat shock, and 60 min after heat shock to view using fluorescence microscopy. To perform degradation assays, samples were collected immediately after cycloheximide treatment and 1 and 2 h after treatment. Quantitation was done by counting ∼100 cells and dividing the number of cells containing aggregates by the total number of cells counted. To test steady state FFL activity, light unit measurements were taken when cells reached log phase exactly as described (53Abrams J.L. Morano K.A.

https://openalex.org/W2087613739,"Acute fatty acid (FA) exposure potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in β cells through metabolic and receptor-mediated effects. We assessed the effect of fatty acids on the dynamics of the metabolome in INS-1 cells following exposure to [U-(13)C]glucose to assess flux through metabolic pathways. Metabolite profiling showed a fatty acid-induced increase in long chain acyl-CoAs that were rapidly esterified with glucose-derived glycerol-3-phosphate to form lysophosphatidic acid, mono- and diacylglycerols, and other glycerolipids, some implicated in augmenting insulin secretion. Glucose utilization and glycolytic flux increased, along with a reduction in the NADH/NAD(+) ratio, presumably by an increase in conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate. The fatty acid-induced increase in glycolysis also resulted in increases in tricarboxylic cycle flux and oxygen consumption. Inhibition of fatty acid activation of FFAR1/GPR40 by an antagonist decreased glycerolipid formation, attenuated fatty acid increases in glucose oxidation, and increased mitochondrial FA flux, as evidenced by increased acylcarnitine levels. Conversely, FFAR1/GPR40 activation in the presence of low FA increased flux into glycerolipids and enhanced glucose oxidation. These results suggest that, by remodeling glucose and lipid metabolism, fatty acid significantly increases the formation of both lipid- and TCA cycle-derived intermediates that augment insulin secretion, increasing our understanding of mechanisms underlying β cell insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1989669556,"The human dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Most antipsychotic drugs influence dopaminergic transmission through blocking dopamine receptors, primarily DRD2. We report here the post-transcriptional regulation of DRD2 expression by two brain-expressed microRNAs (miRs), miR-326 and miR-9, in an ex vivo mode, and show the relevance of miR-mediated DRD2 expression regulation in human dopaminergic neurons and in developing human brains. Both miRs targeted the 3'-UTR (untranslated region) of DRD2 in NT2 (neuron-committed teratocarcinoma, which endogenously expresses DRD2) and CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell lines, decreasing luciferase activity measured by a luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-326 overexpression reduced DRD2 mRNA and DRD2 receptor synthesis. Both antisense miR-326 and antisense miR-9 increased DRD2 protein abundance, suggesting an endogenous repression of DRD2 expression by both miRs. Furthermore, a genetic variant (rs1130354) within the DRD2 3'-UTR miR-targeting site interferes with miR-326-mediated repression of DRD2 expression. Finally, co-expression analysis identified an inverse correlation of DRD2 expression with both miR-326 and miR-9 in differentiating dopaminergic neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and in developing human brain regions implicated in schizophrenia. Our study provides empirical evidence suggesting that miR-326 and miR-9 may regulate dopaminergic signaling, and miR-326 and miR-9 may be considered as potential drug targets for the treatment of disorders involving abnormal DRD2 function, such as schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2042762777,"Chemotherapy constitutes the standard modality of treatment for localized head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, many patients fail to respond and relapse after this treatments due to the acquisition of chemo-resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel drugs that could reverse the resistant phenotype. Curcumin, the constituent of the spice turmeric has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative properties in several tumor types. However, use of curcumin has been limited due to its poor bio-absorption. Recently, a novel class of curcumin analogs, based on diarylidenylpiperidones (DAP), has been developed by incorporating a piperidone link to the beta-diketone structure and fluoro substitutions on the phenyl groups. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of H-4073, a parafluorinated variant of DAP, using both in vitro and in vivo head and neck cancer models. Our results demonstrate that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it significantly inhibited cell proliferation in all the HNSCC cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell lines with H-4073 significantly reversed the chemo-resistance as observed by cell viability assay (MTT), apoptosis assay (Annexin V binding) and cleaved caspase-3 (Western blot). H-4073 mediated its anti-tumor effects by inhibiting JAK/STAT3, FAK, Akt and VEGF signaling pathways that play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, survival and angiogenesis. In the SCID mouse xenograft model, H-4073 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis effects of cisplatin, with no added systemic toxicity. Interestingly, H-4073 inhibited tumor angiogenesis by blocking VEGF production by tumor cells as well as directly inhibiting endothelial cell function. Taken together, our results suggest that H-4073 is a potent anti-tumor agent and it can be used to overcome chemotherapy resistance in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2019985975,"Osteoclastic bone resorption depends upon the cell's ability to organize its cytoskeleton. Because vinculin (VCL) is an actin-binding protein, we asked whether it participates in skeletal degradation. Thus, we mated VCL(fl/fl) mice with those expressing cathepsin K-Cre (CtsK-VCL) to delete the gene in mature osteoclasts or lysozyme M-Cre (LysM-VCL) to target all osteoclast lineage cells. VCL-deficient osteoclasts differentiate normally but, reflecting cytoskeletal disorganization, form small actin rings and fail to effectively resorb bone. In keeping with inhibited resorptive function, CtsK-VCL and LysM-VCL mice exhibit a doubling of bone mass. Despite cytoskeletal disorganization, the capacity of VCL(-/-) osteoclastic cells to normally phosphorylate c-Src in response to αvβ3 integrin ligand is intact. Thus, integrin-activated signals are unrelated to the means by which VCL organizes the osteoclast cytoskeleton. WT VCL completely rescues actin ring formation and bone resorption, as does VCL(P878A), which is incapable of interacting with Arp2/3. As expected, deletion of the VCL tail domain (VCL(1-880)), which binds actin, does not normalize VCL(-/-) osteoclasts. The same is true regarding VCL(I997A), which also prevents VCL/actin binding, and VCL(A50I) and VCL(811-1066), both of which arrest talin association. Thus, VCL binding talin, but not Arp2/3, is critical for osteoclast function, and its selective inhibition retards physiological bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W2062285270,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most common AIDS-related malignancy. KSHV vIL-6 promotes KS development, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reported that KSHV vIL-6 enhanced the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in endothelial cells,increased the global genomic DNA methylation, and promoted cell proliferation and migration. And this effect could be blocked by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-azadeoxycytidine. We also showed that vIL-6 induced up-regulation of DNMT1 was dependent on STAT3 activation. Therefore, the present study suggests that vIL-6 plays a role in KS tumorigenesis partly by activating DNMT1 and inducing aberrant DNA methylation, and it might be a potential target for KS therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1984833729,"We developed a novel cationic antimicrobial peptide, AG30/5C, which demonstrates angiogenic properties similar to those of LL-37 or PR39. However, improvement of its stability and cost efficacy are required for clinical application. Therefore, we examined the metabolites of AG30/5C, which provided the further optimized compound, SR-0379. SR-0379 enhanced the proliferation of human dermal fibroblast cells (NHDFs) via the PI3 kinase-Akt-mTOR pathway through integrin-mediated interactions. Furthermore SR-0379 promoted the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in co-culture with NHDFs. This compound also displays antimicrobial activities against a number of bacteria, including drug-resistant microbes and fungi. We evaluated the effect of SR-0379 in two different would-healing models in rats, the full-thickness defects under a diabetic condition and an acutely infected wound with full-thickness defects and inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment with SR-0379 significantly accelerated wound healing when compared to fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). The beneficial effects of SR-0379 on wound healing can be explained by enhanced angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, proliferation of endothelial cells and fibroblasts and antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that SR-0379 may have the potential for drug development in wound repair, even under especially critical colonization conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2127439967,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that leads to severe vision loss and dysregulation of the complement system is thought to be associated with the disease. To investigate associations of polymorphisms in AMD susceptibility genes with systemic complement activation, 2655 individuals were genotyped for 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near 23 AMD associated risk genes. Component 3 (C3) and its catabolic fragment C3d were measured in serum and AMD staging was performed using multimodal imaging. The C3d/C3 ratio was calculated and associations with environmental factors, SNPs and various haplotypes of complement factor H (CFH) genes and complement factor B (CFB) genes were analyzed. Linear models were built to measure the influence of genetic variants on the C3d/C3 ratio. The study cohort included 1387 patients with AMD and 1268 controls. Higher C3d/C3 ratios were found for current smoker (p = 0.002), higher age (p = 1.56 × 10(-7)), AMD phenotype (p = 1.15 × 10(-11)) and the two SNPs in the C3 gene rs6795735 (p = 0.04) and rs2230199 (p = 0.04). Lower C3d/C3 ratios were found for diabetes (p = 2.87 × 10(-6)), higher body mass index (p = 1.00 × 10(-13)), the SNPs rs1410996 (p = 0.0001), rs800292 (p = 0.003), rs12144939 (p = 4.60 × 10(-6)) in CFH, rs4151667 (p = 1.01 × 10(-5)) in CFB and individual haplotypes in CFH and CFB. The linear model revealed a corrected R-square of 0.063 including age, smoking status, gender, and genetic polymorphisms explaining 6.3% of the C3d/C3 ratio. After adding the AMD status the corrected R-square was 0.067. In conclusion, none of the evaluated genetic polymorphisms showed an association with increased systemic complement activation apart from two SNPs in the C3 gene. Major genetic and non-genetic factors for AMD were not associated with systemic complement activation."
https://openalex.org/W1992986428,"Objectives To assess the relationship between proximity to specific sports facilities and participation in the corresponding sports activities for adolescents in Germany. Methods A sample of 1,768 adolescents aged 11–17 years old and living in 161 German communities was examined. Distances to the nearest sports facilities were calculated as an indicator of proximity to sports facilities using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Participation in specific leisure-time sports activities in sports clubs was assessed using a self-report questionnaire and individual-level socio-demographic variables were derived from a parent questionnaire. Community-level socio-demographics as covariates were selected from the INKAR database, in particular from indicators and maps on land development. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between proximity to the nearest sports facilities and participation in the corresponding sports activities. Results The logisitic regression analyses showed that girls residing longer distances from the nearest gym were less likely to engage in indoor sports activities; a significant interaction between distances to gyms and level of urbanization was identified. Decomposition of the interaction term showed that for adolescent girls living in rural areas participation in indoor sports activities was positively associated with gym proximity. Proximity to tennis courts and indoor pools was not associated with participation in tennis or water sports, respectively. Conclusions Improved proximity to gyms is likely to be more important for female adolescents living in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2134011082,"Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) is associated with the development of diaphragm atrophy and contractile dysfunction, and respiratory muscle weakness is thought to contribute significantly to delayed weaning of patients. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for preventing these processes may have clinical benefit. The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in CMV-mediated diaphragm wasting and weakness in rats. CMV-induced diaphragm atrophy and contractile dysfunction coincided with marked increases in STAT3 phosphorylation on both tyrosine 705 (Tyr705) and serine 727 (Ser727). STAT3 activation was accompanied by its translocation into mitochondria within diaphragm muscle and mitochondrial dysfunction. Inhibition of JAK signaling during CMV prevented phosphorylation of both target sites on STAT3, eliminated the accumulation of phosphorylated STAT3 within the mitochondria, and reversed the pathologic alterations in mitochondrial function, reduced oxidative stress in the diaphragm, and maintained normal diaphragm contractility. In addition, JAK inhibition during CMV blunted the activation of key proteolytic pathways in the diaphragm, as well as diaphragm atrophy. These findings implicate JAK/STAT3 signaling in the development of diaphragm muscle atrophy and dysfunction during CMV and suggest that the delayed extubation times associated with CMV can be prevented by inhibition of Janus kinase signaling.-Smith, I.

https://openalex.org/W2034128694,"Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is overexpressed in many types of cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Meloxicam, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, has shown potential therapeutic effects against HCC, but the mechanisms accounting for its anti-cancer activities remain unclear.Meloxicam inhibited the ability of human HCC cells expressing higher levels of COX-2 to migrate, invade, adhere and form colonies through upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and downregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2. Meloxicam induced cell apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and Fas-L, and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins including survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), through inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT. Addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the major product of COX-2, could abrogate the effects of meloxicam on the expression of survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), but not Bax and Fas-L, indicating that meloxicam induces cell apoptosis via both COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways. Meloxicam also induced cell autophagy by upregulating Beclin 1 and light chain 3-II. Specific inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine and chloroquine had little effect on cell apoptosis but could enhance the pro-apoptotic effects of meloxicam by further upregulating the expression of Bax.Meloxicam executes its antitumor effects by targeting the COX-2/MMP-2/E-cadherin, AKT, apoptotic and autophagic pathways in COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways, and inhibition of cell autophagy could help to overcome the resistance to meloxicam-induced apoptosis in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2003954264,"Resistin is an adipokine that has been implicated in energy metabolism regulation in rodents but has been little studied in dairy cows. We determined plasma resistin concentrations in early lactation in dairy cows and investigated the levels of resistin mRNA and protein in adipose tissue and the phosphorylation of several components of insulin signaling pathways one week post partum (1 WPP) and at five months of gestation (5 MG). We detected resistin in mature bovine adipocytes and investigated the effect of recombinant bovine resistin on lipolysis in bovine adipose tissue explants. ELISA showed that plasma resistin concentration was low before calving, subsequently increasing and reaching a peak at 1 WPP, decreasing steadily thereafter to reach pre-calving levels at 6 WPP. Plasma resistin concentration was significantly positively correlated with plasma non esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels and negatively with milk yield, dry matter intake and energy balance between WPP1 to WPP22. We showed, by quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, that resistin mRNA and protein levels in adipose tissue were higher at WPP1 than at 5 MG. The level of phosphorylation of several early and downstream insulin signaling components (IRβ, IRS-1, IRS-2, Akt, MAPK ERK1/2, P70S6K and S6) in adipose tissue was also lower at 1 WPP than at 5 MG. Finally, we showed that recombinant bovine resistin increased the release of glycerol and mRNA levels for ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) and HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) in adipose tissue explants. Overall, resistin levels were high in the plasma and adipose tissue and were positively correlated with NEFA levels after calving. Resistin is expressed in bovine mature adipocytes and promotes lipid mobilization in adipose explants in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2058103012,"Accelerating introductions of forest insects challenge decision-makers who might or might not respond with surveillance programs, quarantines, eradication efforts, or biological control programs. Comparing ecological controls on indigenous vs. introduced populations could inform responses to new introductions. We studied the European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, which is not a pest in its native forests, is a serious invasive pest in the southern hemisphere, and now has an uncertain future in North America after its introduction there. Indigenous populations of S. noctilio (in Galicia, Spain) resembled those in New York in that S. noctilio were largely restricted to suppressed trees that were also dying for other reasons, and still only some dying trees showed evidence of S. noctilio: 20–40% and 35–51% in Galicia and New York, respectively. In both areas, P. sylvestris (native to Europe) was the species most likely to have attacks in non-suppressed trees. P. resinosa, native to North America, does not appear dangerously susceptible to S. noctilio. P. radiata, which sustains high damage in the southern hemisphere, is apparently not innately susceptible because in Galicia it was less often used by native S. noctilio than either native pine (P. pinaster and P. sylvestris). Silvicultural practices in Galicia that maintain basal area at 25–40 m2/ha limit S. noctilio abundance. More than 25 species of other xylophagous insects feed on pine in Galicia, but co-occurrences with S. noctilio were infrequent, so strong interspecific competition seemed unlikely. Evidently, S. noctilio in northeastern North America will be more similar to indigenous populations in Europe, where it is not a pest, than to introduced populations in the southern hemisphere, where it is. However, S. noctilio populations could behave differently when they reach forests of the southeastern U.S., where tree species, soils, climate, ecology, management, and landscape configurations of pine stands are different."

The PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) domain is one of the most common modular interaction domains, mediating protein-protein interactions by binding to the C terminus, or to an internal sequence, of a target protein. PDZ domains consist of 80–90 amino acid residues and normally fold into six β strands and two α helices. Peptide ligands bind into a pocket lined by helix α2, strand β2, and the β1–β2 loop, leading to the formation of an antiparallel β sheet between the ligand and the PDZ domain (1Ivarsson Y.

Through its interaction with dystrophin-related protein 2 (Drp2), L-PRX is a member of the periaxin-Drp2-dystroglycan complex.

Except for Drp2, no other binding partners for PRX have been reported, and the ligand of the PRX PDZ domain is, hence, also unknown. The homology of PRX to other proteins is very low; essentially, the only conserved domain is the PDZ domain (15Han H. Myllykoski M. Ruskamo S. Wang C. Kursula P.

Even this domain is poorly conserved, and the only homologues with sequence identity >30% in this region are the giant AHNAK proteins. The PDZ domain of PRX has the highest sequence identity, 57%, with AHNAK2. PRX and the AHNAK proteins form a unique subfamily of PDZ proteins that are likely to have similar functions in complexes linking the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton (12de Morrée A. Droog M.

Here, we report the first crystal structures for PRX and AHNAK2. Their PDZ domains exhibit uniquely intertwined dimers, with extensive three-dimensional domain swapping. Longer constructs of PRX were also characterized in solution and observed to be mainly disordered outside the PDZ domain. The structures of the PRX and AHNAK2 PDZ domains implicate an intriguing mechanism for the formation of stable homodimers. Based on strong interactions in the crystal state, similar dimerization of both proteins is likely to occur also in vivo.

Briefly, the constructs were expressed as His-tagged variants in Escherichia coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. The affinity tag was removed, and the final purification step consisted of size exclusion chromatography. The constructs that were produced include residue ranges 1–147 (full-length S-PRX), 1–127 (the region common to S- and L-PRX), 14–127, 14–117, and 14–107.

The molecular weight of the samples was calculated by comparing the forward scattering intensity, I(0), to that of freshly prepared BSA. Crystallization of the PRX PDZ domain (residues 14–107) has been described (22Han H. Kursula P. Preliminary crystallographic analysis of the N-terminal PDZ-like domain of periaxin, an abundant peripheral nerve protein linked to human neuropathies.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst.

New higher resolution native data were collected at the P13 EMBL/DESY beamline at PETRA III (Hamburg, Germany). A tungsten-derivatized PRX PDZ crystal was prepared by soaking in 5 mm (NH4)2WS4 for 2 days. The preparation of a xenon-derivatized crystal was executed at BESSY (Berlin, Germany). A crystal was picked and incubated in the xenon chamber at 200 p.s.i. for 8 min. Diffraction data for the derivatized crystals were collected on beamline BL14.1 at BESSY. Crystals of the AHNAK2 PDZ domain were similarly obtained with sitting-drop vapor diffusion using a 35 mg/ml protein stock in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, with a well solution consisting of 10% PEG8000 and 50 mm KH2PO4. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the EMBL/DESY beamline P13 at PETRA III (Hamburg). All data were processed using XDS (33Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11318) Google Scholar). The phasing of PRX, which was solved first, did not work either by molecular replacement or by the bromide single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. Thus, various derivatization experiments were performed, and data from a crystal soaked with tungsten showed a strong anomalous signal. In addition, crystals incubated in the xenon chamber also exhibited an anomalous signal from xenon. Combining these two datasets with native diffraction data, phasing was successful. Phasing by MIRAS, followed by automatic model building, was done with AutoSol in Phenix (34Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

The oligomeric state of the PRX and AHNAK2 constructs in solution (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) was studied using static light scattering. Samples of the protein variants used for crystal structure determination were run through a size exclusion column with an Äkta Purifier (GE Healthcare), and refractive index and light scattering were subsequently measured online using the Optilab rEX and miniDAWN TREOS instruments (Wyatt). Data were analyzed with ASTRA software (Wyatt). The run was similarly performed in the presence of 6 m urea. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectra were measured on beamline CD1 at ISA, University of Århus (Denmark). The buffer was 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). Each sample was scanned from 280 to 170 nm in 100-μm quartz cuvettes at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Each spectrum was measured 3 times, and the corresponding buffer spectrum was subtracted. Deconvolution was carried out on the Dichroweb server (39Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. DICHROWEB, an online server for protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopic data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1990) Google Scholar). Urea titration of both proteins was done using a Chirascan Plus (Applied Photophysics) instrument, in a 0.5-mm cuvette. PRX (0.6 mg/ml) was in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, and AHNAK2 (0.2 mg/ml) in H2O. Spectra were also measured in the presence of up to 6 m urea. The native PAGE samples of PRX and AHNAK2 PDZ domains were prepared at different concentrations of SDS and urea in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl. The gel was run in 25 mm Tris, 195 mm glycine (pH 8.5) at 4 °C for 2 h and Coomassie stained. The recombinant PRX PDZ domain was a folded dimer, as evidenced by CD spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography, and static light scattering (Fig. 1). The PDZ domain of AHNAK2 was also homodimeric in solution (Fig. 1D). CD spectroscopy indicated both proteins were stable in 1 m urea, but started unfolding in 3 m urea (Fig. 1B). Static light scattering proved that the dimers observed in solution were dissociated into unfolded monomers at 6 m urea (Fig. 1, C and D). Native gel electrophoresis further showed that the mobility of neither protein was affected by urea concentrations up to 1 m (Fig. 1E), whereas changes in mobility were seen with SDS. Hence, the dimers are stable in solution at relatively high concentrations of urea. The crystal structure of the PRX PDZ domain was solved at 2.7-Å resolution (Table 1). Three monomers exist in one asymmetric unit, and the structure presents unique dimeric folding, involving a high degree of domain swapping and intertwining between the two monomers (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Statistics of x-ray data collection and structure refinement Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Crystal structure of the PRX PDZ domain and comparison with other dimeric PDZ domains.

Compared with other PDZ domains, which generally have 6 β strands, the PRX PDZ domain does not have separate strands β4 and β5, but a long β4/5 strand, and the β4-β5 loop is missing. The loss of this loop results in the change of direction of α2 and β6 in the overall monomer structure. These units further intertwine with the neighboring monomer and vice versa, and two monomers form a domain-swapped homodimer (Fig. 2). Homo- and heterodimerization of PDZ domains have been observed. However, only the ZO-1 PDZ2 domain was reported to be a domain-swapped homodimer (40Fanning A.S. Lye M.F. Anderson J.M. Lavie A.

Although in ZO-1 PDZ2, a domain-swapped homodimer is formed through swapping the N-terminal β1 and β2 strands with the neighboring molecule, much more extensive domain swapping is present in PRX, via the interchange of α2 and β6 between two monomers (Fig. 2). In the PRX dimer, a 6-stranded antiparallel β sheet is formed by the two chains, with the two β4/5 strands in the center (Fig. 3). Every second β strand comes from a different chain, resulting in a highly intertwined structure for the homodimer. This sheet is formed of strands β1, β4/5, and β6 of the A and B chains, in the order β1(A)-β6(B)-β4/5(A)-β4/5(B)-β6(A)-β1(B). In addition, the α2 helices are side by side in the dimer structure. Between the α2 helices from the two chains, π-π stacking is present between the side chains of Phe75 and Tyr90. This stacking also includes Pro89 and Phe72; in addition, there is a buried hydrophobic core (Fig. 4A). Another unique conformation is present on the β1 strand. In PRX, β1 ends at Glu22, and a bulge is observed from Thr23 to Ala25. Gln26–Gly28 acquire an additional small β strand conformation, β1′, by backbone hydrogen bonding with Tyr90–Val92 on strand β6 of the neighboring monomer. This bulge is formed due to the insertion of one residue into the β1 strand in PRX (Fig. 4B). The side chain of Thr23 makes the missing hydrogen bond to the neighboring strand. The two peptide binding sites of the PRX homodimer are composed between helix α2 and strand β2 from different chains. Because the first residue of the α2 helix is Tyr, the PRX PDZ domain can be categorized into class III and may specifically bind to a C-terminal (D/E)-X-Φ-COOH motif on the ligand protein (43Sheng M. Sala C. PDZ domains and the organization of supramolecular complexes.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). A backbone peptide group between Val29 and Ser30, expected to recognize the target ligand C terminus, is flipped compared with earlier PDZ domain structures (Fig. 4C). As a result, the carbonyl moiety points toward the expected position of the ligand peptide carboxyl terminus.

Hypothesizing that individuals with MPS may reflect a pre-stage of PD, i.e. a stage in which the nigrostriatal system is already affected although to a milder degree than at the time of PD diagnosis, aim of this study was to evaluate the similarities between MPS and PD. Methods The TREND study is a prospective cross-sectional cohort study in individuals >50 years with biennial assessments designed to identify markers for an earlier diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. For this substudy 992 individuals were included for analyses (892 controls, 73 MPS individuals, 27 PD patients). Parameters defining risk of PD (sex, age, positive family history), prodromal markers (hyposmia, REM sleep behavior disorder, depression and autonomic failure) as well as quantitative fine motor, axial motor and cognitive parameters were compared between the three cohorts. Results As expected, PD patients differed from controls with regard to 12 of 15 of the assessed parameters. MPS individuals differed significantly from controls in 12 of the PD-associated parameters, but differed from PD only in 5 parameters. Conclusion This study shows that individuals with MPS share many prodromal and clinical markers of PD with PD patients, implying that either a common dynamic process or similar constitutional factors occur in MPS individuals and PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2080278146,"In this study, we present the spatial structure of the wheat antimicrobial peptide (AMP) Tk-AMP-X2 studied using NMR spectroscopy. This peptide was found to adopt a disulfide-stabilized α-helical hairpin fold and therefore belongs to the α-hairpinin family of plant defense peptides. Based on Tk-AMP-X2 structural similarity to cone snail and scorpion potassium channel blockers, a mutant molecule, Tk-hefu, was engineered by incorporating the functionally important residues from κ-hefutoxin 1 onto the Tk-AMP-X2 scaffold. The designed peptide contained the so-called essential dyad of amino acid residues significant for channel-blocking activity. Electrophysiological studies showed that although the parent peptide Tk-AMP-X2 did not present any activity against potassium channels, Tk-hefu blocked Kv1.3 channels with similar potency (IC50 ∼ 35 μm) to κ-hefutoxin 1 (IC50 ∼ 40 μm). We conclude that α-hairpinins are attractive in their simplicity as structural templates, which may be used for functional engineering and drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2106070269,"Cyanobacteria, formerly called blue-green algae, are abundant bacteria that carry out green plant photosynthesis, fixing CO2 and generating O2. Many species can also fix N2 when reduced nitrogen sources are scarce. Many studies imply the existence of intracellular communicating channels in filamentous cyanobacteria, in particular, the nitrogen-fixing species. In a species such as Anabaena, growth in nitrogen-depleted medium, in which ∼10% of the cells differentiate into anaerobic factories for nitrogen fixation (heterocysts), requires the transport of amino acids from heterocysts to vegetative cells, and reciprocally, the transport of sugar from vegetative cells to heterocysts. Convincing physical evidence for such channels has been slim. Using improved preservation of structure by high-pressure rapid freezing of samples for electron microscopy, coupled with high-resolution 3D tomography, it has been possible to visualize and measure the dimensions of channels that breach the peptidoglycan between vegetative cells and between heterocysts and vegetative cells. The channels appear to be straight tubes, 21 nm long and 14 nm in diameter for the latter and 12 nm long and 12 nm in diameter for the former.-Omairi-Nasser, A., Haselkorn, R., Austin, J. II.

https://openalex.org/W2155364865,"Protein structure prediction is critical to functional annotation of the massively accumulated biological sequences, which prompts an imperative need for the development of high-throughput technologies. As a first and key step in protein structure prediction, protein structural class prediction becomes an increasingly challenging task. Amongst most homological-based approaches, the accuracies of protein structural class prediction are sufficiently high for high similarity datasets, but still far from being satisfactory for low similarity datasets, i.e., below 40% in pairwise sequence similarity. Therefore, we present a novel method for accurate and reliable protein structural class prediction for both high and low similarity datasets. This method is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) in conjunction with integrated features from position-specific score matrix (PSSM), PROFEAT and Gene Ontology (GO). A feature selection approach, SVM-RFE, is also used to rank the integrated feature vectors through recursively removing the feature with the lowest ranking score. The definitive top features selected by SVM-RFE are input into the SVM engines to predict the structural class of a query protein. To validate our method, jackknife tests were applied to seven widely used benchmark datasets, reaching overall accuracies between 84.61% and 99.79%, which are significantly higher than those achieved by state-of-the-art tools. These results suggest that our method could serve as an accurate and cost-effective alternative to existing methods in protein structural classification, especially for low similarity datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2028818944,"Psoralen 4 (Pso4) is an evolutionarily conserved protein that has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including RNA splicing and resistance to agents that cause DNA interstrand cross-links. Here we show that the hPso4 complex is required for timely progression through S phase and transition through the G2/M checkpoint, and it functions in the repair of DNA lesions that arise during replication. Notably, hPso4 depletion results in delayed resumption of DNA replication after hydroxyurea-induced stalling of replication forks, reduced repair of spontaneous and hydroxyurea-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and increased sensitivity to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor. Furthermore, we show that hPso4 is involved in the repair of DSBs by homologous recombination, probably by regulating the BRCA1 protein levels and the generation of single strand DNA at DSBs. Together, our results demonstrate that hPso4 participates in cell proliferation and the maintenance of genome stability by regulating homologous recombination. The involvement of hPso4 in the recombinational repair of DSBs provides an explanation for the sensitivity of Pso4-deficient cells to DNA interstrand cross-links."
https://openalex.org/W2005109881,"The mechanism by which IFN-α regulates the host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection in humans is poorly understood. In the present study, we found that freshly isolated pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMCs) from tuberculous pleural effusion but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) spontaneously expressed IFN-α and IL-1β in vivo. In addition, exogenous IFN-α significantly inhibited production of IL-1β in PFMCs after stimulation with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). To further evaluate the effect of endogenous IFN-α on BCG-induced IL-1β production, a neutralizing antibody to IFN-α was added to the cultures of BCG-stimulated PFMCs. As expected, neutralization of IFN-α by antibody significantly enhanced the production of IL-1β. Notably, we showed that IFN-α inhibited production of IL-1β through 2 distinct mechanisms: IFN-α signaling, via the STAT1 transcription factor, suppressed caspase-1-dependent IL-1β maturation, and IFN-α induced the production of IL-10 in a STAT1-dependent manner in which IL-10 reduced the abundance of IL-1β. In contrast, we found that IFN-α enhanced the production of IFN-γ, and IFN-γ also suppressed IL-1β production in the PFMCs during BCG stimulation. Our findings demonstrate that IFN-α employs distinct pathways for regulating IL-1β production and reveal that in the case of M.tb infection, the induction of IFN-α and IFN-γ might be associated with M.tb immune escape and disease progression in infected humans.-Ma, J., Yang, B., Yu, S., Zhang, Y., Zhang, X., Lao, S., Chen, X., Li, B., Wu, C.

https://openalex.org/W2094913879,"Background Perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) can be used to measure key aspects of tumor vascularity in vivo and recent studies suggest that perfusion imaging may be useful in the early assessment of response to angiogenesis inhibitors. Aim of this work is to compare Parametric Response Maps (PRMs) with the Region Of Interest (ROI) approach in the analysis of tumor changes induced by bevacizumab and irinotecan in recurrent glioblastomas (rGBM), and to evaluate if changes in tumor blood volume measured by perfusion MRI may predict clinical outcome. Methods 42 rGBM patients with KPS ≥50 were treated until progression, as defined by MRI with RANO criteria. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) variation after 8 weeks of treatment was calculated through semi-automatic ROI placement in the same anatomic region as in baseline. Alternatively, rCBV variations with respect to baseline were calculated into the evolving tumor region using a voxel-by-voxel difference. PRMs were created showing where rCBV significantly increased, decreased or remained unchanged. Results An increased blood volume in PRM (PRMCBV+) higher than 18% (first quartile) after 8 weeks of treatment was associated with increased progression free survival (PFS; 24 versus 13 weeks, p = 0.045) and overall survival (OS; 38 versus 25 weeks, p = 0.016). After 8 weeks of treatment ROI analysis showed that mean rCBV remained elevated in non responsive patients (4.8±0.9 versus 5.1±1.2, p = 0.38), whereas decreased in responsive patients (4.2±1.3 versus 3.8±1.6 p = 0.04), and re-increased progressively when patients approached tumor progression. Conclusions Our data suggest that PRMs can provide an early marker of response to antiangiogenic treatment and warrant further confirmation in a larger cohort of GBM patients."
https://openalex.org/W2000515922,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate ion channels, modulate neuronal excitability, and contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders. ROS differentially suppress fast “ball-and-chain” N-type inactivation of cloned Kv1 and Kv3 potassium channels but not of Kv4 channels, likely due to a lack of reactive cysteines in Kv4 N-termini. Recently, we discovered that N-type inactivation of Kv4 channel complexes can be independently conferred by certain N-terminal variants of Kv4 auxiliary subunits (DPP6a, DPP10a). Here, we report that both DPP6a and DPP10a, like Kv subunits with redox-sensitive N-type inactivation, contain a highly conserved cysteine in their N-termini (Cys-13). To test if N-type inactivation mediated by DPP6a or DPP10a is redox sensitive, Xenopus oocyte recordings were performed to examine the effects of two common oxidants, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) and diamide. Both oxidants markedly modulate DPP6a- or DPP10a-conferred N-type inactivation of Kv4 channels, slowing the overall inactivation and increasing the peak current. These functional effects are fully reversed by the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and appear to be due to a selective modulation of the N-type inactivation mediated by these auxiliary subunits. Mutation of DPP6a Cys-13 to serine eliminated the tBHP or diamide effects, confirming the importance of Cys-13 to the oxidative regulation. Biochemical studies designed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism show no evidence of protein-protein disulfide linkage formation following cysteine oxidation. Instead, using a biotinylated glutathione (BioGEE) reagent, we discovered that oxidation by tBHP or diamide leads to S-glutathionylation of Cys-13, suggesting that S-glutathionylation underlies the regulation of fast N-type inactivation by redox. In conclusion, our studies suggest that Kv4-based A-type current in neurons may show differential redox sensitivity depending on whether DPP6a or DPP10a is highly expressed, and that the S-glutathionylation mechanism may play a previously unappreciated role in mediating excitability changes and neuropathologies associated with ROS."

The success of this parasite depends on several unique structures including an inner membrane complex (IMC) that lines the interior of the plasma membrane and contains proteins important for gliding motility and replication. Of these proteins, the IMC sub-compartment proteins (ISPs) have recently been shown to play a role in asexual T. gondii daughter cell formation, yet the mechanism is unknown. Complicating mechanistic characterization of the ISPs is a lack of sequence identity with proteins of known structure or function. In support of elucidating the function of ISPs, we first determined the crystal structures of representative members TgISP1 and TgISP3 to a resolution of 2.10 and 2.32 Å, respectively. Structural analysis revealed that both ISPs adopt a pleckstrin homology fold often associated with phospholipid binding or protein-protein interactions. Substitution of basic for hydrophobic residues in the region that overlays with phospholipid binding in related pleckstrin homology domains, however, suggests that ISPs do not retain phospholipid binding activity. Consistent with this observation, biochemical assays revealed no phospholipid binding activity. Interestingly, mapping of conserved surface residues combined with crystal packing analysis indicates that TgISPs have functionally repurposed the phospholipid-binding site likely to coordinate protein partners. Recruitment of larger protein complexes may also be aided through avidity-enhanced interactions resulting from multimerization of the ISPs.

https://openalex.org/W2001961576,"Background Though von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common coagulation disorder, due to the complexity of the molecular analysis of von Willebrand factor gene (VWF), not many reports are available from this country. Large size of the gene, heterogeneous nature of mutations and presence of a highly homologous pseudogene region are the major impediments in the genetic diagnosis of VWD. The study is aimed at unravelling the molecular pathology in a large series of VWD patients from India using an effective strategy. Method We evaluated 85 unrelated Indian type 3 VWD families to identify the molecular defects using a combination of techniques i.e. PCR-RFLP, direct DNA sequencing and multiple ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Results Mutations could be characterized in 77 unrelated index cases (ICs). 59 different mutations i.e. nonsense 20 (33.9%), missense 13 (22%), splice site 4 (6.8%), gene conversions 6 (10.2%), insertions 2 (3.4%), duplication 1 (1.7%), small deletions 10 (17%) and large deletions 3 (5.1%) were identified, of which 34 were novel. Two common mutations i.e. p.R1779* and p.L970del were identified in our population with founder effect. Development of alloantibodies to VWF was seen in two patients, one with nonsense mutation (p.R2434*) and the other had a large deletion spanning exons 16–52. Conclusion The molecular pathology of a large cohort of Indian VWD patients could be identified using a combination of techniques. A wide heterogeneity was observed in the nature of mutations in Indian VWD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2049327743,"The function of some hypothetical proteins, possibly regulated by key hrp regulators, in the pathogenicity of phytopathogenic bacteria remains largely unknown. In the present study, in silicon microarray data demonstrated that the expression of 17 HrpX-regulated protein (Xrp) genes of X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc), which causes bacterial leaf streak in rice, were either positively or negatively regulated by HrpX or/and HrpG. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that five Xrps possess a putative type III secretion (T3S) signal in the first 50 N-terminal amino acids, six xrp genes contain a PIP-box-like sequence (TTCGB-NX-TTCGB, 9≤X≤25) in the promoter regions, and two Xrps have both motifs. Twelve Xrps are widely conserved in Xanthomonas spp., whereas four are specific for X. oryzae (Xrp6) or Xoc (Xrp8, Xrp14 and Xrp17). In addition to the regulation by HrpG/HrpX, some of the 17 genes were also modulated by another hrp regulator HrpD6. Mutagenesis of these 17 genes indicated that five Xrps (Xrp1, Xrp2, Xrp5, Xrp8 and Xrp14) were required for full virulence and bacterial growth in planta. Immunoblotting assays and fusion with N-terminally truncated AvrXa10 indicated that Xrp3 and Xrp5 were secreted and translocated into rice cells through the type-III secretion system (T3S), suggesting they are novel T3S effectors. Our results suggest that Xoc exploits an orchestra of proteins that are regulated by HrpG, HrpX and HrpD6, and these proteins facilitate both infection and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2032674860,"In grasses, variation in seed size and dormancy often results from a seed's position within a dispersal unit. In this paper, I asked whether seed positional effect within a spikelet contributes to ecotypic differentiation between two populations of Avena sterilis having different species range position and associated aridity. I created experimental seed banks in which germination of seeds (florets) having different positions within a spikelet was examined over three years. In addition, two germination tests were conducted under controlled conditions. The two populations were found to have a short-living soil seed bank due to sequential germination of the florets. Although positional seed dormancy effect in A. sterilis does not appear to be a specific desert adaptation against unpredictability of rainfall events, this trait does contribute to ecotypic differentiation between desert and Mediterranean populations. Consistent with bet hedging buffering against rainfall unpredictability, germination fractions in the first year were higher in the Mediterranean than in the desert population, while seeds of the desert origin had stronger dormancy and more sequential germination of florets."
https://openalex.org/W2082534603,"Several recent studies have described a strong correlation between nutritional or economic data and the number of Nobel awards obtained across a large range of countries. This sheds new light on the intriguing question of the key predictors of Nobel awards chances. However, all these studies have been focused on a single predictor and were only based on simple correlation and/or linear model analysis. The main aim of the present study was thus to clarify this debate by simultaneously exploring the influence of food consumption (cacao, milk, and wine), economic variables (gross domestic product) and scientific activity (number of publications and research expenditure) on Nobel awards. An innovative statistical analysis, hierarchical partitioning, has been used because it enables us to reduce collinearity problems by determining and comparing the independent contribution of each factor. Our results clearly indicate that a country's number of Nobel awards can be mainly predicted by its scientific achievements such as number of publications and research expenditure. Conversely, dietary habits and the global economy variable are only minor predictors; this finding contradicts the conclusions of previous studies. Dedicating a large proportion of the GDP to research and to the publication of a high number of scientific papers would thus create fertile ground for obtaining Nobel awards."
https://openalex.org/W1991021280,"Precursor mRNA encoding CNGA3 subunits of cone photoreceptor cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels undergoes alternative splicing, generating isoforms differing in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the protein. In humans, four variants arise from alternative splicing, but the functional significance of these changes has been a persistent mystery. Heterologous expression of the four possible CNGA3 isoforms alone or with CNGB3 subunits did not reveal significant differences in basic channel properties. However, inclusion of optional exon 3, with or without optional exon 5, produced heteromeric CNGA3 + CNGB3 channels exhibiting an ∼2-fold greater shift in K1/2,cGMP after phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate application compared with channels lacking the sequence encoded by exon 3. We have previously identified two structural features within CNGA3 that support phosphoinositides (PIPn) regulation of cone CNG channels: N- and C-terminal regulatory modules. Specific mutations within these regions eliminated PIPn sensitivity of CNGA3 + CNGB3 channels. The exon 3 variant enhanced the component of PIPn regulation that depends on the C-terminal region rather than the nearby N-terminal region, consistent with an allosteric effect on PIPn sensitivity because of altered N-C coupling. Alternative splicing of CNGA3 occurs in multiple species, although the exact variants are not conserved across CNGA3 orthologs. Optional exon 3 appears to be unique to humans, even compared with other primates. In parallel, we found that a specific splice variant of canine CNGA3 removes a region of the protein that is necessary for high sensitivity to PIPn. CNGA3 alternative splicing may have evolved, in part, to tune the interactions between cone CNG channels and membrane-bound phosphoinositides."
https://openalex.org/W1970693236,"The alterations of MicroRNAs(miRNAs) in host cell after foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection is still obscure. To increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of FMDV at the post-transcriptional regulation level, Solexa high-throu MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role both in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and host-virus interactions. Despite investigations of miRNA expression ghput sequencing and bioinformatic tools were used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and analyze their functions during FMDV infection of PK-15cells. Results indicated that 9,165,674 and 9,230,378 clean reads were obtained, with 172 known and 72 novel miRNAs differently expressed in infected and uninfected groups respectively. Some of differently expressed miRNAs were validated using stem-loop real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis for target genes revealed that differently expressed miRNAs were involved in immune response and cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2076143443,"The tyrosine kinase c-Src is upregulated in numerous human cancers, implying a role for c-Src in cancer progression. Previously, we have shown that sequestration of activated c-Src into lipid rafts via a transmembrane adaptor, Cbp/PAG1, efficiently suppresses c-Src-induced cell transformation in Csk-deficient cells, suggesting that the transforming activity of c-Src is spatially regulated via Cbp in lipid rafts. To dissect the molecular mechanisms of the Cbp-mediated regulation of c-Src, a combined analysis was performed that included mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments in a c-Src- or Cbp-inducible system. c-Src activity was first determined as a function of c-Src or Cbp levels, using focal adhesion kinase (FAK) as a crucial c-Src substrate. Based on these experimental data, two mathematical models were constructed, the sequestration model and the ternary model. The computational analysis showed that both models supported our proposal that raft localization of Cbp is crucial for the suppression of c-Src function, but the ternary model, which includes a ternary complex consisting of Cbp, c-Src, and FAK, also predicted that c-Src function is dependent on the lipid-raft volume. Experimental analysis revealed that c-Src activity is elevated when lipid rafts are disrupted and the ternary complex forms in non-raft membranes, indicating that the ternary model accurately represents the system. Moreover, the ternary model predicted that, if Cbp enhances the interaction between c-Src and FAK, Cbp could promote c-Src function when lipid rafts are disrupted. These findings underscore the crucial role of lipid rafts in the Cbp-mediated negative regulation of c-Src-transforming activity, and explain the positive role of Cbp in c-Src regulation under particular conditions where lipid rafts are perturbed."
https://openalex.org/W2089613619,"Nitrogen (N) is, after water, the most limiting resource in semiarid ecosystems. However, knowledge on the N cycling ability of semiarid woody plants is still very rudimentary. This study analyzed the seasonal change in the N concentrations and pools of the leaves and woody organs of two species of semiarid sub-shrubs with contrasting leaf habit. The ability of both species to uptake, remobilize and recycle N, plus the main storage organ for N during summer drought were evaluated. We combined an observational approach in the field with experimental (15)N labelling of adult individuals grown in sand culture. Seasonal patterns of N concentrations were different between species and organs and foliar N concentrations of the summer deciduous Lepidium subulatum were almost double those of the evergreen Linum suffruticosum. L. subulatum up took ca. 60% more external N than the evergreen and it also had a higher N resorption efficiency and proficiency. Contrastingly, L. suffruticosum relied more on internal N remobilization for shoot growth. Differently to temperate species, the evergreen stored N preferentially in the main stem and old trunks, while the summer deciduous stored it in the foliage and young stems. The higher ability of L. subulatum to uptake external N can be related to its ability to perform opportunistic growth and exploit the sporadic pulses of N typical of semiarid ecosystems. Such ability may also explain its high foliar N concentrations and its preferential storage of N in leaves and young stems. Finally, L. suffruticosum had a lower ability to recycle N during leaf senescence. These strategies contrast with those of evergreen and deciduous species from temperate and boreal areas, highlighting the need of further studies on semiarid and arid plants."
https://openalex.org/W2096317653,"SELEX, the process of selecting aptamers, is often hampered by the difficulty of preparing target molecules in their native forms and by a lack of a simple yet quantitative assay for monitoring enrichment and affinity of reactive aptamers. In this study, we sought to discover DNA aptamers against human serum markers for potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. To circumvent soluble expression and immobilization for performing SELEX, we ectopically expressed soluble growth factors on the surface of yeast cells to enable cell-SELEX and devised a flow cytometry-based method to quantitatively monitor progressive enrichment of specific aptamers. High-throughput sequencing of selected pools revealed that the emergence of highly enriched sequences concurred with the increase in the percentage of reactive aptamers shown by flow cytometry. Particularly, selected DNA aptamers against VEGF were specific and of high affinity (KD = ∼ 1 nM) and demonstrated a potent inhibition of capillary tube formation of endothelial cells, comparable to the effect of a clinically approved anti-VEGF antibody drug, bevacizumab. Considering the fact that many mammalian secretory proteins have been functionally expressed in yeast, the strategy of implementing cell-SELEX and quantitative binding assay can be extended to discover aptamers against a broad array of soluble antigens."
https://openalex.org/W2026099332,"To adapt the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders Quality Indicators (ACOVE QIs) for use in Italy, to assess the adherence to these indicators as reported in the medical records of residents in a nursing home (NH), to compare this adherence for general medical and geriatric conditions, and eventually, to identify the relationships between patients' characteristics and reported processes of care.Two physicians collected the data by reviewing medical records of all NH residents in the previous 5 years, for a period of one year. Patients aged <65 years were excluded. A total of 245 patients were reviewed during the study period. The ACOVE QIs set, developed for NH processes of care, was used to assess the quality of care. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify and to assess the role of patients' characteristics on quality of processes of care by several domains of care in general medical and geriatric conditions.With the exception of diabetes management, quality of processes of care for general medical conditions approached adequate adherence. Care falls substantially short of acceptable levels for geriatric conditions (pressure ulcers, falls, dementia). On the contrary, the recommended interventions for urinary incontinence were commonly performed. Adherence to indicators varied for the different domains of care and was proven worse for the screening and prevention indicators both for geriatric and general medical conditions. Statistical analysis showed disparities in provision of appropriate processes of care associated with gender, age, co-morbidities, level of function and mobility, length of stay and modality of discharge by NHs.Adherence to recommended processes of care delivered in NH is inadequate. Substantial work lies ahead for the improvement of care. Efforts should focus particularly on management of geriatric conditions and on preventive healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W2319584291,"We present a new approach for pathogen surveillance we call Geogenomics. Geogenomics examines the geographic distribution of the genomes of pathogens, with a particular emphasis on those mutations that give rise to drug resistance. We engineered a new web system called Geogenomic Mutational Atlas of Pathogens (GoMAP) that enables investigation of the global distribution of individual drug resistance mutations. As a test case we examined mutations associated with HIV resistance to FDA-approved antiretroviral drugs. GoMAP-HIV makes use of existing public drug resistance and HIV protein sequence data to examine the distribution of 872 drug resistance mutations in ∼502,000 sequences for many countries in the world. We also implemented a broadened classification scheme for HIV drug resistance mutations. Several patterns for geographic distributions of resistance mutations were identified by visual mining using this web tool.
