The more southerly of these areas indicate distinctly less arid climates than those farther north, and even contain appreciable quantities of coal, which Brooks interprets as a product of equatorial rain forests. It is perhaps too much to expect a meteorologist to be fully qualified to deal with purely geological questions, but when he ventures into a field in which geology plays almost as important a part as meteorology, the active collaboration of a geologist of recognized standing would appear to be a highly desirable safeguard. It would at least prevent such violence to terminology as the indiscriminate use of the word to describe any and all intervals of geologic time, from Mesozoic period to Pliocene period. Although marred by too frequent errors such as those mentioned, the book is nevertheless a remarkable and highly valuable work. A prodigious amount of labor has gone into its preparation. It is to be hoped that it will have a salutary effect on those who see in new and fantastic hypotheses the only solution to the problem of geologic climates. MALCOLm H. BiSSELL CLARK UNIVERSITY"

The indole is extracted with chloroform and is then treated with a modified Ehrlich reagent. The possibility of use for the detection of water pollution is indicated."
