https://openalex.org/W2050602600,"The androgen receptor (AR) mediates the actions of male sex steroids. Human AR genomic DNA was cloned from a flow-sorted human X chromosome library by using a consensus nucleotide sequence from the DNA-binding domain of the family of nuclear receptors. The AR gene was localized on the human X chromosome between the centromere and q13. Cloned complementary DNA, selected with an AR-specific oligonucleotide probe, was expressed in monkey kidney (COS) cells and yielded a high-affinity androgen-binding protein with steroid-binding specificity corresponding to that of native AR. A predominant messenger RNA species of 9.6 kilobases was identified in human, rat, and mouse tissues known to contain AR and was undetectable in tissues lacking AR androgen-binding activity, including kidney and liver from androgen-insensitive mice. The deduced amino acid sequence of AR within the DNA-binding domain has highest sequence identity with the progesterone receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1965283193,Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding androgen receptors were obtained from human testis and rat ventral prostate cDNA libraries. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs indicated the presence of a cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain that is highly conserved in all steroid receptors. The human cDNA was transcribed and the RNA product was translated in cell-free systems to yield a 76-kilodalton protein. The protein was immunoprecipitable by human autoimmune antibodies to the androgen receptor. The protein bound androgens specifically and with high affinity.

The identity of the axial ligand, the nature of the heme environment, and the steric accessibility of the heme iron and heme edge combine to play major roles in determining the reactivity of each enzyme. The importance of synthetic porphyrin models in understanding the properties of the protein-free metal center is emphasized. The conclusions described herein have been derived from studies at the interface between biological and inorganic chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1978509807,"Single cells were recorded from cortical area V4 of two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained on a visual discrimination task with two levels of difficulty. Behavioral evidence indicated that the monkeys' discriminative abilities improved when the task was made more difficult. Correspondingly, neuronal responses to stimuli became larger and more selective in the difficult task. A control experiment demonstrated that changes in general arousal could not account for the effects of task difficulty on neuronal responses. It is concluded that increasing the amount of attention directed toward a stimulus can enhance the responsiveness and selectivity of the neurons that process it."

https://openalex.org/W2093516457,There may be a causal relationship between expression of the G2-specific gene nimA and mitotic regulation in Aspergillus. To test this relationship we have introduced extra inducible copies of nimA into Aspergillus and determined the effect of nimA overproduction on mitotic regulation. The results show that nimA overexpression causes mitotic induction in less than a cell cycle and maintains chromatin in a condensed state. These effects occur even if cells are first blocked in S phase. Sequence analysis shows that the nimA gene encodes a potential protein kinase. These data indicate that there is indeed a causal relationship between expression of nimA and the regulation of mitosis and further implicate protein phosphorylation in mitotic control.

https://openalex.org/W1488906799,"Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) is a multisubunit protein involved in the initiation of translation. Although numerous models have been proposed for its mechanism of action, none have been definitive. An assay dependent on GEF activity was developed using highly purified eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and GEF from Ehrlich cells. GEF was considered in terms of an enzyme whose catalytic function was the exchange of eIF-2-bound [alpha-32P]GDP for unlabeled nucleotide. The turnover number of GEF at 37 degrees C, calculated on the basis of enzyme kinetic methods is 0.027 s, which is consistent with in vivo rates of protein synthesis. Moreover, kinetic data support an enzyme-substituted mechanism as the mode of GEF function. This mechanism proposes the existence of a GEF.eIF-2.GDP complex and excludes the possibility of two guanine nucleotide binding sites on eIF-2. An analogous mechanism has been recently reported for elongation factor Ts, suggesting the importance of this mechanism to protein synthesis. The mechanism of inhibition of GEF function by eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation has also been investigated. It has been generally assumed that the mechanism by which eIF-2(P) traps GEF is an excessively stable complex, from which GEF is released very slowly. Data presented here, however, reveal that eIF-2(P).GDP is a competitive inhibitor of GEF (rather than an irreversible inhibitor) competing with eIF-2.GDP for binding to GEF. Even though the eIF-2(P).GDP.GEF complex dissociates too rapidly to measure, GEF is trapped because it has at least 150-fold greater affinity for eIF-2(P).GDP than for eIF-2.GDP. The implications of competitive inhibition with respect to the mechanism of reversal of inhibition by an eIF-2(P) phosphatase are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981862236,"Results from several systems indicate that correct protein folding and subunit assembly correlate with the transport of membrane and secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex. Because the site of oligomer assembly and its precise relationship to intracellular transport remain unclear, we have studied in detail the folding and trimerization of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA0) relative to its transport from ER to Golgi. Trimerization and transport were analyzed using several different methods, including transport inhibitors, temperature blocks, semi-intact cells, in vitro protein translocation, and immunocytochemistry. Taken together, the results clearly demonstrate that trimerization occurs at a point prior to exit from the ER. Before assembly, HA0 monomers were extensively folded and possessed intramolecular disulfide bonds, but monomers were not transported to the cis Golgi compartment. Thus, hemagglutinin progresses through at least two intermediate states before transport to the Golgi: highly folded monomers and trimers that have not yet left the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2054606544,"In the parasitic wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, males are haploid and usually develop from unfertilized eggs, whereas females are diploid and develop from fertilized eggs. Some individuals in this species carry a genetic element, termed psr (paternal sex ratio), which is transmitted through sperm and causes condensation and subsequent loss of paternal chromosomes in fertilized eggs, thus converting diploid females into haploid males. In this report the psr trait was shown to be caused by a supernumerary chromosome. This B chromosome contains at least three repetitive DNA sequences that do not cross-hybridize to each other or to the host genome. The psr chromosome apparently produces a trans-acting product responsible for condensation of the paternal chromosomes, but is itself insensitive to the effect. Because the psr chromosome enhances its transmission by eliminating the rest of the genome, it can be considered the most ""selfish"" genetic element yet described."

Some of the emerging research directions that hold forth great promise in this area deal with the development of chiral catalysts for these processes. This review attempts to unify one aspect of this field, the development of catalysts and catalyst models for the enantioselective addition of hydride and carbon nucleophiles to carbonyl substrates. Mechanistic constructs for the stereodifferentiating transition states are provided."

https://openalex.org/W1527263892,"A systematic study was undertaken to observe the effects of dietary (dioleoyl) triacyl-sn-glycerol structure on chylomicron composition and metabolism. First studied was a series of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(saturated)acyl-sn-glycerols, where the fatty acid esterified at the 3-position was varied from 14 to 24 carbons. Next a series of 1,3-dioleoyl-2-acyl glycerols was studied, with various fatty acids esterified at the glycerol 2-position. These stereospecific triacyl-sn-glycerols were fed to donor rats and lymph chylomicrons were isolated, analyzed, and reinjected into recipient rats to study their disappearance from plasma and delivery to tissues. As shown by their compositions, chylomicrons obtained after feeding triacylglycerols containing all sn-3 fatty acid of chain length greater than 20 carbons were under-represented, possibly due to poorer digestion by lipases, or poorer absorption by the intestine. The 18-carbon saturated chain fatty acid (stearic acid) was equally well represented in chylomicrons whether in the 2- or 3-position of the fed triacylglycerol. The presence of increased amounts of long-chain saturated fatty acids in donor chylomicron triacylglycerols affected the metabolism of chylomicrons injected into the bloodstream of recipient rats. In particular the rate of removal of labeled cholesteryl esters, tracing removal of the partially degraded chylomicron remnants was slowed by the saturated chains, with palmitic acid and the 20-carbon fatty acid, arachidic acid, showing the most severe effects. There were clear differences in the removal from plasma of injected lymph chylomicrons derived from fed triacylglycerols containing stearic acid in either the 2- or 3-position, with evidence for remnants from the symmetrical triacylglycerols being less rapidly removed from the circulating blood. This effect was investigated further by injected model emulsions of chylomicrons, where the 2-position was substituted with saturated or transunsaturated acyl chains. Quantitation of removal from the blood stream of these model lipoproteins confirmed that a saturated or transunsaturated long chain fatty acid at the 2-position of the emulsion triacylglycerols slowed remnant removal from the blood. In some cases, with both lymph chylomicron and with emulsions, the lipolytic step mediated by lipoprotein lipase was also slowed."
https://openalex.org/W1591344937,"Gastrin gene expression exhibits a complex pattern of tissue-specific expression during the neonatal development of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas. In the rat fetus, the pancreas is the major site of gastrin expression; very little gastrin is found in the antrum which is the major site of adult expression. Pancreatic gastrin mRNA is identical to the antral species having the same transcriptional initiation site. The post-translational processing of the pancreatic gastrin peptide, however, differs in being fully tyrosine sulfated, and thus it resembles gastrin's homologue, cholecystokinin. Pancreatic gastrin is maximally expressed during late fetal gestation before the marked rise in somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon mRNA levels which occurs during the last 4 days of gestation. After birth, gastrin mRNA levels rapidly disappear as the other islet mRNAs achieve stable maximal levels. Unlike the pancreas, gastrin gene expression in the duodenum and antrum is similar to the development profiles of somatostatin and glucagon gene expression. In the duodenum, however, expression of cholecystokinin differs from the common developmental pattern in being expressed only after birth. Thus, pancreatic gastrin gene expression shows a reciprocal relationship to the developmental expression of cholecystokinin in the duodenum."

https://openalex.org/W1990784107,A link between scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conventional transmission electron microscopy has been established for biological material by applying STM on freeze-dried recA-DNA complexes coated with a conducting film. The topography of the complexes observed by means of STM revealed a right-handed single helix composed of about six recA monomers per helical turn.
https://openalex.org/W302025023,"The polypeptide of uromodulin, an immunosuppressive glycoprotein isolated from human urine, has been shown to be identical to that of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein and is synthesized exclusively in the kidney (Hession, C., Decker, J. M., Sherblom, A. P., Kumar, S. (1987) Science 237, 1479-1484). Uromodulin binds recombinant murine interleukin 1 alpha with high affinity, and this binding can be inhibited by addition of specific saccharides (Muchmore, A. V., and Decker, J. M. (1987) J. Immunol. 138, 2541-2546). We now report that uromodulin binds recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) with high affinity. Both diacetylchitobiose and Man(alpha 1-6)(Man(alpha 1-3]-Man-O-ethyl are effective inhibitors of the binding, whereas a wide variety of other saccharides are not inhibitory. Although Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein contains predominantly tetraantennary N-linked chains, the binding to rTNF is unaffected by removal of terminal sialic acid, galactose, and N-acetylhexosamine residues. Fractionation of a Pronase digest of uromodulin by gel filtration yields material that inhibits the binding of uromodulin to rTNF but is of lower molecular weight than the major oligosaccharide. Uromodulin does not inhibit the cytotoxic activity of rTNF as monitored by lysis of tumor cell targets but effectively protects mice from lethal challenge with lipopolysaccharide, an event that may involve lymphokine toxicity. We have previously shown that rTNF binds to sections of human kidney and is localized in the same region as uromodulin. Thus, rTNF interacts with uromodulin via carbohydrate chains that are less processed than the major tetraantennary chain, and this interaction may be critical in promoting clearance and/or reducing toxicity of TNF and other lymphokines."
https://openalex.org/W1999354137,"A quasi-continuous double hellix, containing a pseudoknot and ending in a single-stranded region which contains CCA, can be formed at the 3' terminus of the genomic RNAs of certain plant viruses. M1 RNA (the catalytic subunit) alone and the RNAase P holoenzyme from E. coli cleave the tRNA-like structure of TYMV RNA in vitro at the 5' side of the quasi-helical structure to generate 5' phosphate and 3' hydroxyl groups in the cleavage products. The intact pseudoknot structure in the substrate is not required for the reaction catalyzed by M1 RNA alone, but its presence markedly improves the efficiency of the reaction. In addition to its essential role in the biosynthesis of tRNA, RNAase P may have another function in vivo, namely, in the physiology of viral infections."
https://openalex.org/W1506718658,"cDNA clones for rat liver 5-aminolevulinate synthase have been isolated and used to examine mRNA levels in different rat tissues. Northern hybridization analysis of total RNA from various rat tissues showed the presence of a single 5-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA species of estimated length 2.3 kilobases. Primer extension and RNase mapping studies indicated that the mRNA is identical in all tissues. Highest basal levels were seen in liver and heart. Administration of hemin to rats reduced the basal level of this mRNA only in liver but the heme precursor, 5-aminolevulinate (or its methyl ester), repressed the basal levels in liver, kidney, heart, testis, and brain. The drug 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide increased the mRNA level in liver and kidney only while human chorionic gonadotropin hormone elevated the level in testis. Administration of the heme precursor 5-aminolevulinate prevented these inductions. Nuclear transcriptional run-off experiments in liver cell nuclei showed that 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide and 5-aminolevulinate exert their effect by altering the rate of transcription of the 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene. The results indicate that a single 5-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA is expressed in all tissues and that its transcription is negatively regulated by heme."
https://openalex.org/W1946205234,"We investigated the effect of 3'-noncoding and poly(A) sequences on the translation and stability of membrane-bound mRNA (maize zein) and free mRNA (Xenopus beta-globin) by injecting SP6 transcripts into stage 6 Xenopus oocytes. With zein mRNA, the presence or absence of a 3'-noncoding or poly(A) sequence had little effect on mRNA stability over 24 h, and the 3'-noncoding sequence played essentially no role in mRNA translation. With short periods of incubation, e.g. 1-2 h, the presence or absence of a poly(A) tail also had little effect on zein mRNA translation; but after longer periods, translation of the poly(A-) mRNA was significantly reduced. A similar pattern of mRNA translation was observed for poly(A+) and poly(A-) Xenopus beta-globin mRNAs. These differences in translational efficiency correlated with the formation of maximally loaded polysomes (seven-eight ribosomes/mRNA) for the poly(A+) zein mRNA and a failure to form large polysomes with the poly(A-) zein mRNA. These results are consistent with a model in which the 3'-poly(A) sequence of mRNAs facilitates reinitiation of ribosomes during protein synthesis."

Structures were generated with distance geometry and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. A novel molecular replacement method was also used with the same NMR constraints to generate solution structures of S. obliquus plastocyanin from the x-ray structure of the homologous poplar protein. Scenedesmus obliquus plastocyanin in solution adopts a β-barrel structure. The backbone conformation is well defined and is similar overall to that of poplar plastocyanin in the crystalline state. The distinctive acidic region of the higher plant plastocyanins, which functions as a binding site for electron transfer proteins and inorganic complexes, differs in both shape and charge in S. obliquus plastocyanin."
https://openalex.org/W1489941322,"The structural alterations which occur in bacteriorhodopsin (bR) during dark adaptation (BR570----BR548) and the primary phototransition of the dark photocycle (BR548----KD610) have been investigated by Fourier transform infrared and UV difference spectroscopy. Possible contributions of tyrosine to the Fourier transform infrared difference spectra of these transitions were assigned by incorporating ring per-deuterated tyrosine into bR. Based on these data and UV difference measurements, we conclude that a stable tyrosinate exists in BR570 at physiological temperature and that it protonates during formation of BR548. A tyrosinate protonation has also been observed at low temperature during the primary phototransition of BR570 to the red-shifted photoproduct K630 (1). However, we now find that no tyrosine protonation change occurs during the primary phototransition of BR548 to the red-shifted intermediate KD610. Through analysis of bR containing isotopically labeled retinals, it was also determined that the chromophore of KD610 exits in a 13-trans, 15-cis configuration. On the basis of this evidence and previous studies on the structure of the chromophore in BR570, BR548, and K630, it appears that only the 13-trans,15-trans configuration of the protonated chromophore leads to a stable tyrosinate group. It is proposed that a tyrosinate residue is stabilized due to its interaction with the Schiff base positive charge in the BR570 chromophore. Isomerization of the chromophore about either the C13 = C14 or C = N bond disrupts this interaction causing a protonation of the tyrosinate."
https://openalex.org/W1575310966,"A subset of DNA sequences in the 5'-flanking DNA of the human growth hormone (hGH) gene was examined by protein-DNA binding and gene transfer-expression experiments. Two adjacent cis-acting elements (I and II) were identified between nucleotides -308/-235 of the hGH gene that modulated the expression of a linked reporter gene in transfected HeLa cells. Elements I and II repressed gene expression whereas element II alone activated it. HeLa whole cell extracts contain two factors that bind hGH DNA carrying elements I and II. Factor I binds to single-stranded DNA, and its binding is correlated with repression of gene expression. Factor II binds between nucleotides -275/-257 of the hGH gene. This region is homologous to the binding site for the adenovirus major late transcription factor, and factor II binding to hGH DNA is competed by adenovirus major late promoter DNA, indicating that the hGH and major late adenovirus promoters share a transcription regulatory element."
https://openalex.org/W1573401066,"Three mammalian eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF) are required for the ATP-dependent binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. These three factors, eIF-4A, eIF-4B, and eIF-4F, have also been isolated from wheat germ. Three assays were used to measure the ability of the wheat germ factors to interact with and/or substitute for the mammalian factors. Two assay systems were used to measure partial reactions involving the interaction of the three factors, ATP, and mRNA: 1) RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis and 2) cross-linking of the factors to the 5' cap of oxidized mRNA. A third assay system was used to measure the ability of the factors to support initiation of protein synthesis. The results of the ATP hydrolysis and cross-linking experiments indicate that the wheat germ factors can interact with or substitute for the mammalian factors. Wheat germ eIF-4A appears to be functionally equivalent to mammalian eIF-4A. Wheat germ eIF-4B and eIF-4F appear to be isozymes possessing functions similar to mammalian eIF-4F. Wheat germ eIF-4B does not appear to be a functional equivalent to the mammalian eIF-4B. In a complete translation system from wheat germ, mammalian factors partially substitute for wheat germ factors, whereas the wheat germ factors are ineffective in the mammalian system."
https://openalex.org/W1607565236,"The role of an anion exchange pathway in modulating intracellular pH (pHi) under steady-state and alkaline load conditions was investigated in confluent monolayers of rat type II alveolar epithelial cells using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2'-7'-biscarboxy-ethyl-5,6-carboxylfluorescein. Under steady-state conditions in the presence of 25 mM HCO3-, 5% CO2 at pHo 7.4, pHi was 7.32 in a Na+-replete medium and 7.33 in the absence of Na+. Steady-state pHi was 7.19 in a nominally HCO3(-)-free medium at pHo 7.4, and 7.52 in a Cl(-)-free medium, with both values significantly different from that obtained in the presence of both HCO3- and Cl-. Monolayers in which pHi was rapidly elevated by removal of HCO3-/CO2 from the bathing medium demonstrated an absolute requirement for Cl- to recover toward base-line pHi. The Km of Cl- for the external site of the exchange pathway was 11 +/- 1 mM. Recovery of pHi from the alkaline load in the presence of Cl- was inhibited 60% by the stilbene derivative 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid. Removal of Cl- from the medium of cells bathed in HCO3-/CO2 resulted in a rapid increment in pHi which returned to base line when Cl- was reintroduced into the bathing medium. In contrast, pHi was not perturbed by removal or addition of Cl- to monolayers bathed in a 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered medium, indicating that HCO3- was the preferred species for transport. Recovery of pHi from an alkaline load was not affected by the presence or absence of Na+. These findings define the transport pathway as Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchange. This pathway contributes importantly to determining resting pHi of pneumocytes and enables the cell to recover from an alkaline load."
https://openalex.org/W1532512516,"Heat-stable microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were isolated from rat liver crude extract. The most prominent species showed a molecular mass close to that of bovine adrenal 190-kDa MAP (Kotani, S., Murofushi, H., Maekawa, S., Sato, C., and Sakai, H. (1986) Eur. J. Biochem. 156, 23-29), termed rat 190-kDa MAP. Immunological studies with antiserum against the rat 190-kDa MAP showed that this MAP exists in a variety of rat cells and tissues. The characteristics of the rat 190-kDa MAP, including molecular mass, heat stability, and distribution pattern, were very similar to those of bovine adrenal 190-kDa MAP. However, one-dimensional peptide mapping revealed considerable difference, and there is little mutual immunological cross-reactivity. We also identified in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2a cells a MAP of around 200 kDa which is considered to be MAP4 (Parysek, L. M., Asnes, C.F., and Olmsted, J.B. (1984) J. Cell Biol. 99, 1309-1315). MAP4 was slightly immunoreactive to both anti-(rat 190-kDa MAP) antiserum and anti-(bovine 190-kDa MAP) antiserum. Taking these results together, we conclude that mammalian tissues ubiquitously contain heat-stable MAPs of 200 kDa and that these 200-kDa MAPs should be considered as species-specific homologues."
https://openalex.org/W1533859262,"An attempt has been made at defining the secondary structural requirement for phosphorylation of substrates of a protein tyrosine kinase from the leukemia virus-transformed LSTRA cell line. An examination of the sites of phosphorylation of substrates of protein tyrosine kinases indicated a relatively high probability of the beta-turn as the secondary structural feature at these sites. We have, therefore, synthesized three tyrosine peptides: Ala-Pro-Tyr-Gly-NHCH3, Leu-Pro-Tyr-Ala-NHCH3, and Pro-Gly-Ala-Tyr-NH2, of which the first two peptides, but not the third, would be expected to contain the tyrosine residue in a beta-turn. Circular dichroism and infrared spectral data on the peptides confirmed this expectation. Phosphorylation data on the peptides by the tyrosine kinase showed that the two beta-turn peptides were phosphorylated with Vmax and Km values comparable to those of the 13-residue-long arginine-containing synthetic peptide substrate having a sequence homologous to the autophosphorylation site of the LSTRA kinase. The peptides used here contain the shortest sequence length among the reported synthetic peptide substrates for protein tyrosine kinases. Their preference for the beta-turn indicated that this conformation may serve as the recognition site for tyrosine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1447221596,We have analyzed the effect of base composition at the center of symmetry of inverted repeated DNA sequences on cruciform transitions in supercoiled DNA. For this we have constructed two series of palindromic DNA sequences: one set with differing center and one set with differing center and arm sequences. The F series consists of two 96-base pair perfect inverted repeats which are identical except for the central 10 base pairs which consist of pure AT or GC base pairs. The S series was constructed such that the overall base composition of the inverted repeats was identical but in which the positioning of blocks of AT- and GC-rich sequences varied. The rate of cruciform formation for the inverted repeats in plasmid pUC8 was dramatically influenced by the 8-10 base pairs at the center of the inverted repeat. Inverted repeats with 8-10 AT base pairs in the center were kinetically much more active in cruciform formation than inverted repeats with 8-10 GC base pairs in the center. These experiments show a dominant influence of the center sequences of inverted repeats on the rate of cruciform formation.
https://openalex.org/W1546591235,"The light-dependent protein synthesis occurring in chloroplasts isolated from the leaves of 7-day-old Vigna sinensis responded to heat shock with the induction of a set of four heat shock proteins (HSPs). The synthesis of these four HSPs at the elevated temperature was transcriptionally regulated, and all of them were found to be thylakoid membrane-bound. The synthesis of these chloroplast-coded HSPs was also observed in etioplasts during protein synthesis at the elevated temperatures with the exogenously added ATP. The in vivo induction of these plastid-coded HSPs was observed only in the leaves subjected to gradual increase in temperature but not in leaves subjected to rapid heat shock. Further, the in vitro synthesis of these plastid-coded HSPs was seen only in chloroplasts isolated from the control or from leaves subjected to gradual increase in temperature and not in chloroplasts isolated from leaves subjected to rapid heat shock. Taken together these observations suggest that in V. sinensis, the plastid genome contains a definite heat shock response and the in vivo expression of this response corresponds to the gradual rise in temperature normally occurring under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2442559304,"Binding and internalization of nerve growth factor (NGF) by responsive cells is a complex process. We have incubated rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) with 125I-NGF at 37 degrees C and measured the association of ligand after removal of subsets of bound ligand by different methods. Chase with unlabeled NGF at either 4 or 37 degrees C, acid stripping, nonionic detergent stability, and combinations of these protocols were utilized. These variations of the binding assay were able to distinguish ligand bound to fast versus slow cell surface receptors, NGF bound to slow receptors at the cell surface versus cell interior, and soluble ligand versus cytoskeletally attached NGF. Quantitative and temporal relations among five cellular pools were defined. Experiments with the inhibitors chloroquine, cytochalasin B, and colchicine defined pools of NGF in terms of the route through the cell from the plasma membrane to the lysosome. Chloroquine caused accumulation of NGF only in the pool that was not associated with the cytoskeleton, implicating the involvement of this pool in supplying ligand to the lysosome. Results with cytochalasin B and colchicine suggest that both microfilaments and microtubules are involved in pathways leading to NGF degradation. A semiquantitative model for the movement of NGF through the cell is presented based on these observations."

https://openalex.org/W1670854089,"F430 is the nickel containing tetrapyrrole cofactor of S-methyl coenzyme M methylreductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the final step of methane production by methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of S-methyl coenzyme M (H3CSCH2CH2SO3-) to methane and coenzyme M (HSCH2CH2SO3-). The protein-free F430 obtained from the cytosol of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, strain delta H, exists predominantly in two isomeric forms that differ in relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at the 12 and 13 positions of the macrocycle periphery (Pfaltz, A., Livingston, D. A., Jaun, B., Diekert, G., Thauer, R. K., and Eschenmoser, A. (1985) Helv. Chim. Acta 68, 1338-1358). A simple one-step chromatographic procedure for the large-scale separation of these isomers is described. X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies show that F430 (i.e. the native isomer) is 6-coordinate with long nickel-ligand bonds (approximately 2.1 A), suggesting an approximately planar macrocycle. In contrast, the 12,13-diepimer exhibits a 4-coordinate, square-planar structure with short nickel-nitrogen bonds (approximately 1.9 A), suggesting a ruffled macrocycle. Previous reports, based on other x-ray absorption spectroscopic data, of static disorder in F430 Ni-N distances are shown to be incorrect due to sample heterogeneity. The optical spectrum of F430 (whether purified from the protein-free cytosol or extracted at high ionic strength from the holoenzyme) differs significantly from that of the 12,13-diepimer. The optical spectral differences are correlated with the alterations in coordination number and geometry of the central nickel ion in the two F430 isomers."
https://openalex.org/W1488452134,"The analbuminemic rat strain established by Nagase et al. (Nagase, S., Shimamune, K., and Shumiya, S. (1979) Science 205, 590-591) exhibits hereditary deficiency in albumin biosynthesis. Serum bilirubin concentration is rather lower in homozygous (aa) rats (0.009 +/- 0.002 mg/dl) as compared with heterozygous (Aa) rats (0.047 +/- 0.009 mg/dl) or wild-type Sprague-Dawley (AA) rats (0.034 +/- 0.006 mg/dl) as evidenced by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of bilirubin. After intravenous administration of various amounts of [heme-3H]hemoglobin in rats, [3H]bilirubin derived from [3H]heme of hemoglobin in vivo is more efficiently excreted into bile in aa rats than in Aa or AA rats. [3H]Bilirubin is exclusively bound with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in aa rats, and a significant amount of [3H]bilirubin is shown to bind with HDL in Aa or AA rats in vivo. Scatchard plots revealed that [3H]bilirubin is bound with HDL in three binding modes depending on the molar ratio of [3H]bilirubin to HDL: Kd = 0.8 X 10(-7) M (molar ratio, 0.02-0.06), Kd = 1.6 X 10(-6) M (molar ratio, 0.06-0.41), and Kd = 1.2 X 10(-4) M (molar ratio, 0.79-9.02). Even under extreme conditions of excess hemoglobin administration, the molar ratio remains under 0.041; and thus, expected the Kd value would remain around 0.8 X 10(-7) M. Binding of [3H]bilirubin to rat serum albumin revealed two distinct binding modes depending on the molar ratio of [3H]bilirubin to rat serum albumin: Kd = 3.6 X 10(-7) M (molar ratio, 0.03-0.21), and Kd = 5.0 X 10(-6) M (molar ratio, 0.21-2.46). Under physiological conditions in Aa or AA rats, the former mode would be more reliable than the latter. Thus, HDL could bind with approximately 4.5 times higher affinity than rat serum albumin in Aa or AA rats under physiological conditions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1846353612,"The Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) antigen and its disaccharide component Galβ1,3GalNAc, which is recognized by the plant lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), have been proposed as useful tumor markers because of their apparently specific occurrence in certain types of carcinomas. We have investigated the mechanism for the appearance of the disaccharide at the cell surface of ascites 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells using pulse-chase glucosamine labeling, proteolysis, and PNA precipitation of the cell-surface sialomucin ASGP-1. Glucosamine-labeled disaccharide appears at the cell surface in less than 10 min. Although the appearance of larger oligosaccharides continues to increase, the appearance of labeled disaccharide levels off within an hour. Analysis of intracellular vs. cell surface-labeled oligosaccharides showed that all disaccharide synthesized more than an hour before reaching the cell surface is converted to larger oligosaccharides. Thus, the presence of the disaccharide at the cell surface results from its synthesis late in the transit pathway of the sialomucin tb the cell surface. We propose that the presence of T antigen at the surface of carcinoma cells results from an aberration of the pathway for O-linked glycosyiation in these cells, probably caused by inappropriate localization of the enzymes involved in synthesis of the disaccharide.—Hull, S.

https://openalex.org/W1903023102,"The synthetase that attaches biotin to the aposubunit of transcarboxylase (biotin-[methylmalonyl-CoA-carboxyltransferase]ligase) (EC 6.3.4.9) was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography on cellulose DE-52 and CM-cellulose. The synthetase is a monomer of molecular weight 30,000. The pH and temperature optima for the synthetase are 6.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The apparent Km for the substrates ATP, biotin, and apo 1.3 S subunit of apotranscarboxylase are 38, 2.0, and 0.9 microM, respectively. Ni2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Mn2+ could replace Mg2+ in the reaction. The affinity of synthetase toward metals is as follows: Zn2+ greater than Ni2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Co2+ greater than Mg2+, and the activity with Zn2+ was much greater than that with the other divalent metals. EDTA completely inactivates the enzyme. The metals are necessary not only for the catalytic activity but also for the storage stability of the enzyme. The synthetase shows absolute specificity toward ATP."

https://openalex.org/W1608679310,Endocytosis and subsequent degradation of iduronic acid-rich small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan from fibroblast secretions were studied in human fibroblasts. Upon endocytosis of [3H]leucine- and [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan release of free leucine was 10 to 15 times more rapid than that of inorganic sulfate. Within approximately 3 h a steady state was approached between transport of proteoglycan to the compartment of core protein degradation and release of free leucine. No such steady state could be found with respect to the dermatan sulfate chains. In the presence of benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone or of other SH-protease inhibitors the degradation of the protein moiety of endocytosed proteoglycan was much less inhibited than the degradation of the polysaccharide chain. Benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone did not affect the degradation of dermatan sulfate chains taken up by fluid phase endocytosis and the activities of all known dermatan sulfate-degrading enzymes. Percoll gradient centrifugation indicated that also in the presence of the protease inhibitor the partially degraded proteoglycan accumulated in dense lysosomes. The isolation of intracellular dermatan sulfate peptides and molecular size determinations of endocytosed dermatan sulfate proteoglycan supported the conclusion that a critical proteolytic step is required before the dermatan sulfate chain becomes accessible to hydrolytic enzymes.
https://openalex.org/W1592037470,"Detailed investigations of a serum peptide (less than Glu1-Ala2-Lys3-Ser4-Gln5-Gly6-Gly7-Ser8-++ +Asn9) were carried out by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the structure of the complex formed with Zn(II), thymulin, which has been found to be active in vivo. These experiments were performed in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 solution at different metal:peptide ratios. The results suggest the following conclusions. (i) The Zn(II) complexation corresponds to a fast exchange on the NMR time scale. (ii) The evolution of 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts indicates the existence of two types of complexes: a 1:2 species associating two peptide molecules and one Zn(II) ion and a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. The former is predominant for metal:peptide ratios below unity. (iii) In the 1:2 complex, Zn(II) is coordinated by the Ser4-O gamma H and Asn9-CO2- sites, while in the 1:1 complex, Ser8-O gamma H is the third ligand to the Zn(II) ion. The results are compared with those for the [Ala4] and [Ala8] analogues, and those for the complexes of thymulin with other metal ions (Cu2+ and Al3+) in terms of its biological activity. These comparative studies suggested that the 1:1 complex is the only conformation recognized by the antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1542016920,"The membrane-bound NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase of human neutrophils has been solubilized in approximately 70% yield and purified on concanavalin A-Sepharose and gel sieving columns of varying bed volumes and sieving ranges. The half-life of the solubilized oxidoreductase stored at 2-4 degrees C in the presence of 25% glycerol at pH 8.6 is approximately 30 h. The oxidoreductase contains a flavoprotein identifiable by its fluorescence spectrum for FAD which binds weakly to concanavalin A-Sepharose and elutes from gel sieving columns at a molecular weight range of approximately 51,000. This flavoprotein accounts for approximately 70% of the total FAD content found in granular membrane fractions recovered from activated neutrophils. Recovery of oxidoreductase activity from both concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity and gel sieving columns is affected by the resolution of the flavoprotein free of the cytochrome b component of the oxidoreductase. The resolved flavoprotein and cytochrome b appear unable to catalyze either NADH nor NADPH oxidase activities with O2, ferricyanide, or nitroblue tetrazolium salt serving as electron acceptors."

https://openalex.org/W1481298510,"It has been reported (Poston, J. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1859-1863; (1982) 255, 10067-10072; (1984) 259, 2059-2061) that mammalian tissues contain an adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzyme, leucine 2,3-aminomutase, which catalyzes the interconversion of beta-leucine and leucine. It was also reported that beta-leucine is detectable in normal human serum (mean = 4.8 mumol/liter, n = 37) and is elevated in serum from patients with cobalamin deficiency (mean = 24.7 mumol/liter, n = 17). Serum levels of leucine were claimed to be decreased in the cobalamin deficient patients (mean = 52 mumol/liter) as compared with the normal subjects (mean = 81 mumol/liter). It was also reported that rat liver supernatant catalyzed the formation of beta-leucine, leucine, or both amino acids from iso-fatty acids, and that the generation of leucine from iso-fatty acids was stimulated by adenosylcobalamin and inhibited by unsaturated cobalamin-binding protein. We have synthesized t-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of beta-leucine and leucine and have used capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for their analysis. Using forms of beta-leucine and leucine that contain several deuterium atoms in place of several hydrogen atoms as internal standards, techniques have been developed which make it possible to detect and quantitate as little as 0.1 mumol/liter of beta-leucine or leucine in human serum and in incubations containing rat liver supernatant. beta-Leucine was not detectable, i.e. less than 0.1 mumol/liter, in any sera from 50 normal human subjects or in any sera from 50 cobalamin-deficient patients. The mean level of leucine in the 50 cobalamin-deficient sera was 219 mumol/liter, which was not decreased with respect to that in the 50 control sera (167 mumol/liter). Experiments in which beta-leucine, leucine, isostearic acid, or isocaproic acid were incubated with rat liver supernatant in the presence or absence of adenosylcobalamin or cobalamin-binding protein failed to demonstrate the formation of leucine or beta-leucine or their interconversion under any of the conditions studied. We conclude that beta-leucine is not present in human blood and that the existence of leucine 2,3-aminomutase in mammalian tissues remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1569525911,"The interactions of nucleotides at the allosteric and catalytic sites of phosphorylase kinase were examined. Binding of nucleoside triphosphates at the nucleoside diphosphate allosteric activation site inhibited enzymatic activity; this was observed with either ATP or GTP. Increasing concentrations of ADP caused a biphasic response: low concentrations activated and higher concentrations inhibited. Inhibition was due to the binding of ADP at the catalytic site, as opposed to an allosteric inhibitory site. GDP activated at low concentrations, but did not inhibit even at relatively high concentrations, and is therefore a specific probe for the allosteric site. Maximal activity of the nonactivated holoenzyme at pH 6.8 is achieved at an optimal ratio of ATP to ADP, such that the inhibitory actions of ATP at the allosteric site and of ADP at the catalytic site are balanced. Various potential molecular mechanisms to explain the allosteric activation by ADP were examined and ruled out, thus strengthening our previous conclusion that the activation is predominantly caused by a conformational transition in the beta subunits directly induced by the binding of ADP (Cheng, A., Fitzgerald, T. J., and Carlson, G. M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2535-2542; Trempe, M. R., and Carlson, G. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 4333-4340; Cheng, A., Fitzgerald, T. J., Bhatnager, D., Roskoski, R., Jr., and Carlson, G. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5534-5542). The catalytic site exhibited high stereospecificity for inhibition by the Rp and Sp epimers of adenosine 5'-O-(1-thiodiphosphate), with the Rp epimer (Ki = 0.5 microM) being 136-fold more effective than its Sp counterpart. This can readily explain the inability of the Rp epimer to be an effective allosteric activator."
