https://openalex.org/W2012691408,"Bees have an impressive cognitive capacity1,2,3,4, but the strategies used by individuals in solving foraging tasks have been largely unexplored. Here we test bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in a colour-discrimination task on a virtual flower meadow and find that some bees consistently make rapid choices but with low precision, whereas other bees are slower but highly accurate. Moreover, each bee will sacrifice speed in favour of accuracy when errors are penalized instead of just being unrewarded. To our knowledge, bees are the first example of an insect to show between-individual and within-individual speed– accuracy trade-offs."

The deposited collagen shows an increase in pyridinoline cross-links, which are derived from hydroxylated lysine residues within the telopeptides. This change in cross-linking is related to irreversible accumulation of collagen in fibrotic tissues. The increase in pyridinoline cross-links is likely to be the result of increased activity of the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation of the telopeptides (telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase, or TLH). Although the existence of TLH has been postulated, the gene encoding TLH has not been identified. By analyzing the genetic defect of Bruck syndrome, which is characterized by a pyridinoline deficiency in bone collagen, we found two missense mutations in exon 17 of PLOD2, thereby identifying PLOD2 as a putative TLH gene. Subsequently, we investigated fibroblasts derived from fibrotic skin of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients and found that PLOD2 mRNA is highly increased indeed. Furthermore, increased pyridinoline cross-link levels were found in the matrix deposited by SSc fibroblasts, demonstrating a clear link between mRNA levels of the putative TLH gene (PLOD2) and the hydroxylation of lysine residues within the telopeptides. These data underscore the significance of PLOD2 in fibrotic processes. The hallmark of fibrotic processes is an excessive accumulation of collagen.

These data underscore the significance of PLOD2 in fibrotic processes. The biosynthesis of collagen molecules involves several intracellular post-translational modifications followed by excretion and extracellular aggregation of the collagen molecules into fibrils, which are subsequently stabilized by intermolecular cross-links (1von der Mark K.

Dynamics of Bone and Cartilage. Academic Press, London1999: 31-42Google Scholar). Two related routes are responsible for the formation of these collagen cross-links, namely the allysine route, in which a lysine residue in the telopeptide is converted by lysyl oxidase into the aldehyde allysine, and the hydroxyallysine route, in which a hydroxylysine residue in the telopeptide is converted into the aldehyde hydroxyallysine. Subsequently, the allysine or the hydroxyallysine reacts with a Lys or Hyl residue in the triple helix to form di-, tri-, or tetrafunctional cross-links (3Eyre D.R. Paz M.A. Gallop P.M. Annu. Rev.

The mature cross-links hydroxylysylpyridinoline or lysylpyridinoline are formed via the hydroxyallysine route and occur in a variety of connective tissues such as bone, tendon, ligaments, and cartilage (7Eyre D.R. Koob T.J. Van Ness K.P. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 380-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). In contrast, collagen in the skin is mainly cross-linked via the allysine route. Interestingly, in fibrotic skin (lipodermatosclerosis, keloid) and organ fibrosis (lung, liver), which is characterized by an excessive accumulation of collagen, an increase in cross-links derived from the hydroxyallysine route is found (8Brinckmann J.

It has been shown that the amount of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links is related to the irreversible accumulation of collagen in fibrotic tissues, indicating that collagen containing hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links is more difficult to degrade than collagen containing allysine-derived cross-links (10Last J.A.

Symp. 1985; 114: 80-96PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of the formation of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links in fibrosis is therefore likely to result in the formation of collagen that is easier to degrade, thereby preventing the unwanted collagen accumulation. The increase in hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links in fibrosis is the result of an overhydroxylation of lysine residues within the collagen telopeptides. The enzyme catalyzing the conversion of Lys into Hyl is lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4) (16Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R.

Alternative RNA splicing has been described for PLOD2 only, resulting in the splice variants LH2a and LH2b (LH2b contains an extra exon; Ref. 22Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI is characterized by mutations in PLOD1. Collagen of these patients shows an absence of hydroxylated lysine residues within the triple helix in combination with normal levels of hydroxylated lysine residues within the telopeptides. Therefore, it can be concluded that LH1 catalyzes the conversion of triple helical lysine residues into hydroxylysines (23Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Steinmann B. Eyre D.R. Shao P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1505-1508PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of LH2 and LH3 has not yet been elucidated, and to date no disease has been associated with defects in LH2 or LH3. Bruck syndrome (BS; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) accession number 259450), an autosomal recessive disease, is characterized by osteoporosis, joint contractures at birth, fragile bones, and short stature (25Brenner R.E.

Biochemical analysis of the bone of BS patients revealed an underhydroxylation of lysine residues in the telopeptides of collagen type I, whereas hydroxylation of lysine residues in the triple helix is normal (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F. Van Der Sluijs H.A. Pruijs H.E. Tekoppele J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Together, the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI and the Bruck syndrome imply that a lysyl hydroxylase must exist that specifically hydroxylates the telopeptides and that the activity of such a telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase (TLH) is decreased in BS bone. The identity of TLH had not yet been discovered. Here we show that the gene defect in two BS families is a mutation in PLOD2, showing that PLOD2 encodes TLH. The importance of TLH in fibrotic processes is demonstrated by the highly increased expression of TLH in fibroblasts cultured from the fibrotic skin of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients. Furthermore, higher levels of pyridinoline cross-links were found in the extracellular matrix deposited by the SSc fibroblasts, which shows the link between increased TLH expression and the shift to the hydroxyallysine cross-linking pathway. Patients—In this study, three families with children diagnosed as Bruck syndrome patients were investigated. Two unrelated Kurdish families (families FH and PM), both consanguineous, were described earlier (cases 1, 2, and 3, and 7 and 8, respectively) (26Breslau-Siderius E.J. Engelbert R.H. Pals G. van der Sluijs J.A. J. Pediatr. Orthop. B. 1998; 7: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); the third family (family DR) has not yet been described. This Australian family, where the parents are not consanguineous, had two affected boys deceased prenatally, one affected girl deceased at 2 years, and one surviving unaffected 9-year-old girl. All these BS patients show decreased amounts of pyridinoline cross-links in bone. 2A. J. van der Slot, A.-M. Zuurmond, H. E. H. Pruijs, D. O. Sillence, J. DeGroot, T. W. J. Huizinga, and R. A.

Microsatellite markers, obtained from the Marshfield screening set version 6, were amplified as described earlier (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F.

Myllyla R. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 707-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), were assigned. Mutation Analysis—The exon/intron organization of PLOD2 has not been described. PLOD1 and PLOD3, encoding two other members of the lysyl hydroxylase family, both consist of 19 exons (31Heikkinen J. Hautala T. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Genomics. 1994; 24: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Rautavuoma K. Passoja K. Helaakoski T. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The exon/intron boundaries of both genes are identical. Analysis of clones RP11-758I14 and RP11-274H2 showed identical exon/intron boundaries for PLOD2. In addition, PLOD2 shows an extra exon (22Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), designated exon 13A, which is not found in PLOD1 or PLOD3. To detect DNA sequence variations in exons and exon/intron boundaries of PLOD2, primer pairs were designed to amplify the exons, including the exon/intron boundaries; in addition, a part of the promoter region was amplified (Table I). PCR was carried out on genomic DNA from Bruck syndrome patients, unaffected parents, and a pooled healthy population (Roche Diagnostics) using LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc.). PCR consisted of a 3-min interval at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, a specific annealing temperature as listed in Table I for 90 s or 30 s, and 68 °C for 60 s. Finally, an extension step of 10 min at 68 °C was performed. Purified PCR products served as templates for cycle sequencing using the ABI PRISM™ Big Dye termination cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) and were analyzed on the ABI PRISM™ 310 sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Table IPrimers for mutation analysisExonForward primerReverse primerAnnealing temperaturePromoter5′-CTCCCAAAGCTAAGTGCAGG-3′5′-AGACAGGGATTCCAGGGGT-3′56 °C 30″15′-GTCTCTGCGTTCTCGCGAGA-3′5′-AAGGGCTGTTGGATGAATGAAC-3′56 °C 90″25′-TGAGGTCTCAATTACTGTAGTGA-3′5′-CTTCCTTGTGAGGATTACAGATT-3′56 °C 90″35′-GTACTGTTCAAGTTGATGATGTC-3′5′-GCCACCGTGCCCAACCATATT-3′56 °C 30″45′-ATGGTTTATGTGCCTAGATTCTGA-3′5′-GGAACACCAACTCACATAATACA-3′56 °C 90″55′-TTCTTTCATGGTGAGCTGTGA-3′5′-TGATATCCAGCCAGGTGACA-3′56 °C 30″65′-GCAACTATCGCAGTTTCTACCT-3′5′-CCAAATGGACATAACAAAGGAAAG-3′56 °C 30″75′-CACATACACACACAGACACACG-3′5′-AAAGGCTATCACTCTGCTGAGG-3′64 °C 30″85′-TAAAGGAATATACCTGCTGCAGA-3′5′-ATTCCACTTACATCTACTGCAGA-3′56 °C 90″95′-TTTCAAGTGTTAGAGAACTGCCA-3′5′-CCACTGAACTTAACCCAATGAAT-3′56 °C 90″105′-TCTAAGATTTCTAGGCTACAGGC-3′5′-GTTGGCTACTGCATACGCAAAC-3′60 °C 30″115′-CAGAAAAGTATGCTAGAGAACCA-3′5′-GTAGAACATAACTAAGTTCCCTC-3′56 °C 90″125′-CAGGTTTGTTGAATGAGCTTTCT-3′5′-AGGATTCCAAGTGGTCTTGGG-3′60 °C 90″135′-GGGGCAGTGGTTTATCTCCTA-3′5′-CACAGTGACACACCAACTGGT-3′60 °C 90″13A5′-AGAATACCTGAGAGAGCGGGT-3′5′-ACGCAAACACACAGATGACTGA-3′60 °C 90″145′-CAGTTGAGTGTCAGTGCTATCT-3′5′-CTGGTGTGAGACAGTATCTCAT-3′60 °C 90″155′-ATAAGCATATTCAGAACCAGGCA-3′5′-CTCCACTTTCACATCTTCTGTG-3′60 °C 90″165′-TCATCAATTCTGAGGTGCACCA-3′5′-AGAAACCCGCCCAAACTAAT-3′56 °C 30″175′-AGCAGATGATATACCACATTGGA-3′5′-GTTCATGCCAGTCATTCATCCA-3′60 °C 30″18aSequence primer for exon 18 is 5′-GTCTTTGCAGGCTATTATA-3′.5′-AGCAGATGATATACCACATTGGA-3′5′-GTTCATGCCAGTCATTCATCCA-3′60 °C 30″19bSequence primer for exon 19 is 5-′GCTCAAATGACATAATTTG-3′.5′-AGCAGATGATATACCACATTGGA-3′5′-GTTCATGCCAGTCATTCATCCA-3′60 °C 30″a Sequence primer for exon 18 is 5′-GTCTTTGCAGGCTATTATA-3′.b Sequence primer for exon 19 is 5-′GCTCAAATGACATAATTTG-3′.

Control cultures were obtained from biopsies taken from 10 healthy controls. Cells were grown in minimal essential medium alpha (αMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin until they reached subconfluence. Cells were detached using 0.5 ml of 0.05% trypsin/0.02% EDTA per 25 cm2 and used for total RNA isolation. Real-time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, the RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and subjected to real-time PCR amplification. Real-time PCR amplification of cDNA sequences was performed for LH1, LH2b, LH3, the α2 chain of collagen type 1 (COL1A2), and lysyl oxidase (LOX). A real time PCR was performed for the constitutively expressed β-2-microglobulin (B2M) to standardize for differences in the total amount of cDNA. Each cDNA was amplified using specific primers and specific molecular beacons (Table II and Table III, respectively) in a total reaction volume of 25 μl containing 1× PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems), 0.4 mm of each dNTP, 3.5 mm Mg2+, 500 nm each primer, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems).

Aliquots of 15 μl of each amplified sample were subjected to electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Cross-link Analysis—Measurements were performed on extracellular matrix obtained from fibroblasts cultured for 5 weeks in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). Pyridinoline cross-links were measured in acid hydrolysates of unreduced samples by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (33Bank R.A. Beekman B. Verzijl N. De Roos J.A. Sakkee A.N.

Cross-link analysis and real time PCR data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Patients and controls were compared by Student's t test (two-tailed).

Linkage Analysis of BS Families—To decipher the gene encoding TLH, the gene defect in BS patients was examined. In a previous paper we mapped the BS locus on an 18-centimorgan region on chromosome 17p12 (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F. Van Der Sluijs H.A. Pruijs H.E. Tekoppele J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). At that time, only a single family was available for genotyping because of the extreme rarity of the disease. To refine the candidate region, two other diagnosed BS families (family DR and family PM) were now screened for linkage to chromosome 17p12. Surprisingly, genotype analysis excluded the linkage of both families to chromosome 17p12. This implies that, in addition to a BS locus on chromosome 17p12, a BS locus on another chromosomal region exists. We reasoned that the candidate region for the second BS locus is chromosome 3q23-q24, as PLOD2 encoding LH2 is located in that region (30Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Riviere M. Vanvooren P. Valtavaara M.

This assumption was based on the observation of a parallel increase of LH2 expression and hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links in osteogenic progenitor cells during the course of in vitro differentiation (35Uzawa K. Grzesik W.J. Nishiura T. Kuznetsov S.A. Robey P.G. Brenner D.A. Yamauchi M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 1272-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which suggests that LH2 catalyzes the conversion of the telopeptide lysine residue into hydroxylysine. Indeed, haplotype analysis of family DR and family PM revealed that both families confirm the candidate status of chromosome 3q23 (Fig. 1, a and b). Mutation Analysis of BS Families—To verify that the BS phenotype in the patients in family DR and family PM is indeed due to mutations in PLOD2, a mutation analysis was performed. In both patients of family DR a homozygous missense mutation in exon 17 of C→ T was found, resulting in a Thr → Ile substitution at position 608 and 629 (LH2a and LH2b, respectively). Both parents and the healthy sister were carriers of the mutation (Fig. 2a). In the same exon a homozygous missense mutation of G→ T was observed in both patients of family PM, resulting in a Gly → Val substitution at positions 601 and 622 (LH2a and LH2b, respectively). The parents were heterozygous for the mutation (Fig. 2b). Neither mutation was detected in a pool of 250 chromosomes of healthy individuals, thereby excluding the possibility that these mutations represent polymorphisms. Mutation analysis of patients from the BS family (family FH) showing linkage to chromosome 17p12 (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F. Van Der Sluijs H.A.

TLH Expression in SSc Fibroblasts—Because BS indicates that the specific substrate of LH2 is the lysine residue within the collagen telopeptides, we were interested in finding out whether the expression of LH2 is increased in cells present in fibrotic lesions, as the collagen deposited in fibrotic lesions shows an increased hydroxylation of the telopeptides. Real-time PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from SSc skin fibroblasts revealed that the expression of LH2b mRNA was highly increased in these fibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 3a; controls 0.02 ± 0.01; SSc patients 0.15 ± 0.06; p = 0.003). Interestingly, LH1 (Fig. 3b; controls 0.61 ± 0.23; SSc patients 1.08 ± 0.82) and LH3 (Fig. 3c; controls 0.05 ± 0.02; SSc patients 0.09 ± 0.07) expression levels were unchanged. Expression of LH2a mRNA was undetectable both in controls and SSc patients (Fig. 3d). In agreement with previous data (36LeRoy E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1974; 54: 880-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 37Peltonen L. Palotie A. Myllyla R. Krieg T. Oikarinen A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 14-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), elevated levels of COL1A2 mRNA were found in SSc fibroblasts (Fig. 3e; controls 3.98 ± 2.01; SSc patients 16.53 ± 7.17; p = 0.007). No changes in the expression of LOX mRNA (Fig. 3f; controls 0.43 ± 0.31; SSc patients 0.49 ± 0.24) were observed. Finally, elevated levels of LH2b mRNA expression relative to COL1A2 mRNA expression were found in SSc fibroblasts (controls 0.0057 ± 0.0034; SSc patients 0.0098 ± 0.0021; p = 0.009), whereas LH1 (controls 0.18 ± 0.088; SSc patients 0.06 ± 0.04; p = 0.002), LH3 (controls 0.015 ± 0.007; SSc patients 0.005 ± 0.004; p = 0.002), and LOX (controls 0.12 ± 0.08; SSc patients 0.03 ± 0.005; p = 0.004) mRNA expressions relative to COL1A2 expression were decreased. Analysis of the collagen, deposited by fibroblasts cultured from fibrotic skin of SSc patients, showed an increase in hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links, indicating that the hydroxylation of the collagen telopeptides is also increased in the fibrotic skin of SSc patients (Fig. 4; controls 0.041 ± 0.017; SSc patients 0.15 ± 0.049; p = 0.016). This is in line with previous in vivo data (38Istok R. Bely M. Stancikova M. Rovensky J. Clin. Exp. Dermatol. 2001; 26: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fibrosis is characterized by an excessive accumulation of collagen. Furthermore, a change in the collagen cross-link chemistry is found in fibrotic lesions. Therapies to reduce collagen accumulation in fibrosis are mostly focused on the reduction of collagen synthesis and the induction of proteinase activity. A drawback of these approaches is that not only the pathological but also the physiological collagen production and degradation in the surrounding tissue are affected. Recently, it has been postulated that the change in cross-linking, giving a decrease in the proportion of allysine-derived cross-links in favor of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links, is a unique process in fibrosis (8Brinckmann J.

The amount of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links (such as pyridinolines) is related to the irreversible accumulation of collagen in fibrotic tissues (10Last J.A. King T.E. Nerlich A.G. Reiser K.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Ricard-Blum S. Bresson-Hadni S. Vuitton D.A. Ville G. Grimaud J.A.

Symp. 1985; 114: 80-96PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that collagen containing hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links is more difficult to degrade and therefore contributes significantly to the accumulation of collagen. The increased amount of pyridinolines in fibrosis is the consequence of an overhydroxylation of the lysine residues within the telopeptides. Although the existence of a TLH has been postulated (24Steinmann B. Eyre D.R. Shao P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1505-1508PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C.

A. 1999; 96: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), the gene encoding TLH has, to date, not been identified. Biochemical analysis of the bone of BS patients revealed that the BS phenotype is due to the decreased activity of TLH (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F.

Three lysyl hydroxylases are known, i.e. LH1, LH2, and LH3, encoded by PLOD1, PLOD2, and PLOD3, respectively. LH1 is a helical lysyl hydroxylase (23Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2000; 71: 212-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Steinmann B. Eyre D.R. Shao P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 1505-1508PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the substrate specificity of LH2 and LH3 is unknown. Here we show, by means of mutation analysis, two different missense mutations in exon 17 of PLOD2 in BS patients, indicating that LH2 is the putative TLH. These mutations are situated in an amino acid sequence showing high homology between the different lysyl hydroxylases, LH1, LH2, and LH3, and between the lysyl hydroxylases of species ranging from Homo sapiens to Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 5). Such a strict conservation implies that this region is important for the function of the lysyl hydroxylases in general and that of LH2 in particular. Mutation analysis of patients from a BS family showing linkage to chromosome 17p12 (29Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F. Van Der Sluijs H.A. Pruijs H.E. Tekoppele J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) did not reveal any mutations in the exons, exon/intron-boundaries, or the promoter region of PLOD2. This suggests that these patients must have another defect. Patients linked to chromosome 17 should be called Bruck syndrome type I, whereas patients showing mutations in PLOD2 belong to the Bruck syndrome type II. This subdivision is solely based on genetic data, as we are not aware of phenotypic differences. BS provides, for the first time, insight into the substrate specificity of LH2; it is a telopeptide lysyl hydroxylase. As the increased amount of pyridinolines in fibrosis is likely to be the results of increased TLH activity, we investigated the expression of LH2 in fibrotic tissues. Analysis of LH1, LH2a, LH2b, and LH3 mRNA expression in fibrotic skin of SSc patients revealed that, of the collagen-modifying enzymes, only the mRNA level of LH2b relative to COL1A2 was increased. LH2a was undetectable in both control and SSc fibroblasts, indicating that this splice variant is absent in skin fibroblasts and therefore plays no role in fibrosis. Furthermore, we found normal mRNA levels of LOX, which is the enzyme catalyzing the formation of allysine and hydroxyallysine, a step necessary for the formation of cross-links. The increase in pyridinoline cross-links as found in our fibroblast cultures of SSc patients is therefore not due to increased aldehyde formation. Together, these results imply that only LH2b can be responsible for the overhydroxylation of collagen telopeptide lysine residues in SSc skin, leading to the increased formation of pyridinolines. It is therefore reasonable to assume that LH2b plays an important role in the irreversible accumulation of collagen in fibrosis. The type of cross-links provides a mechanism for regulating the rate of collagen catabolism (10Last J.A. King T.E. Nerlich A.G. Reiser K.M. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1990; 141: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 11Ricard-Blum S. Bresson-Hadni S. Vuitton D.A. Ville G. Grimaud J.A.

Symp. 1985; 114: 80-96PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of the formation of hydroxyallysine-derived cross-links by specifically inhibiting TLH in order to favor the formation of allysine-derived cross-links is likely to make the collagen more susceptible to proteolytic degradation, leading to a decrease in collagen accumulation. An additional advantage of this approach is that the collagen synthesis needed for normal remodeling of the tissue is not compromised, as TLH up-regulation is specifically seen in fibrosis. Inhibition of LH2 is therefore an attractive way to interfere with fibrotic processes, making LH2 a new and promising target for anti-fibrotic therapies.

https://openalex.org/W3010765523,"The strain imposed by mechanical loading on bone tissue normally stimulates a response by bone cells that results in an adjustment of bone architecture that enables the bone to withstand reasonable loads. But it is unclear why this process should become less effective in some 50 per cent of postmenopausal women, who suffer fractures as a result1. Here we show that bone in vivo undergoes an adaptive response to loading that is less effective in the absence of the α-form of the oestrogen receptor (ER-α) and that osteoblast-like cells require ER-α to proliferate in response to mechanical strain in vitro. As ER-α expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes depends on oestrogen concentration2,3,4,5, a failure to maintain bone strength after the menopause might be due to a reduction in the activity of ER-α in bone cells, thereby limiting their anabolic response to mechanical loading and allowing a loss of bone tissue comparable to that associated with disuse."

https://openalex.org/W2032491192,"Hypoxic regions within solid tumors are often resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. BNIP3 (Bcl-2/E1B 19 kDa interacting protein) is a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that is expressed in hypoxic regions of tumors. During hypoxia, BNIP3 expression is increased in many cell types and upon forced overexpression BNIP3 induces cell death. Herein, we have demonstrated that blockage of hypoxia-induced BNIP3 expression using antisense oligonucleotides against BNIP3 or blockage of BNIP3 function through expression of a mutant form of BNIP3 inhibits hypoxia-induced cell death in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. We have also determined that hypoxia-mediated BNIP3 expression is regulated by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) in human epithelial cell lines. Furthermore, HIF-1alpha directly binds to a consensus HIF-1alpha-responsive element (HRE) in the human BNIP3 promoter that upon mutation of this HRE site eliminates the hypoxic responsiveness of the promoter. Since BNIP3 is expressed in hypoxic regions of tumors but fails to induce cell death, we determined whether growth factors block BNIP3-induced cell death. Treatment of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or insulin-like growth factor effectively protected these cells from BNIP3-induced cell death. Furthermore, inhibiting EGF receptor signaling using antibodies against ErbB2 (Herceptin) resulted in increased hypoxia-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells. Taken together, BNIP3 plays a role in hypoxia-induced cell death in human epithelial cells that could be circumvented by growth factor signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2034072513,"The role of prolactin in human breast cancer has been controversial. However, it is now apparent that human mammary epithelial cells can synthesize prolactin endogenously, permitting autocrine/paracrine actions within the mammary gland that are independent of pituitary prolactin. To model this local mammary production of prolactin (PRL), we have generated mice that overexpress prolactin within mammary epithelial cells under the control of a hormonally nonresponsive promoter, neu-related lipocalin (NRL). In each of the two examined NRL-PRL transgenic mouse lineages, female virgin mice display mammary developmental abnormalities, mammary intraepithelial neoplasias, and invasive neoplasms. Prolactin increases proliferation in morphologically normal alveoli and ducts, as well as in lesions. The tumors are of varied histotype, but papillary adenocarcinomas and adenosquamous neoplasms predominate. Neoplasms can be separated into two populations: one is estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive (greater than 15% of the cells stain for ERalpha), and the other is ERalpha- (<3%). ERalpha expression does not correlate with tumor histotype, or proliferative or apoptotic indices. These studies provide a mouse model of hormonally dependent breast cancer, and, perhaps most strikingly, a model in which some neoplasms retain ERalpha, as occurs in the human disease."

Another conformation of ϵ was suggested from observations that the residue (ϵSer108, E. coli numbering) in the C-terminal domain of the E. coli ϵ subunit has interactions with the residues (βGlu381) in the “DELSEED” region of the β subunit (and the homologous region of the α subunit) (9Aggeler R.

Also, it was shown that positive residues in the C-terminal domain of the ϵ subunit of thermophilic F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 would make electrostatic interaction with the DELSEED region of the β subunit (23Hara K.Y. Kato-Yamada Y. Kikuchi Y. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23969-23973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The dynamic and flexible nature of the ϵ subunit has been also reported for chloroplast F0F1 (24Komatsu-Takaki M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In accordance with these biochemical results, a new conformation of ϵ was found in the crystal structure of the complex of truncated-γ (γ′) and ϵ of E. coli F1 (Fig. 1C) (25Rodgers A.J. Wilce M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this γ′ϵ complex, a helical hairpin in the previous structures of ϵ is opened, and the helices are lifted up. Such a location of the ϵ subunit could be an obstacle for the rotation of the γ subunit and, indeed, F0F1, with the ϵ locked to this lifted-up conformation by γ-ϵ cross-linking, did not show ATP hydrolysis activity. Interestingly, however, the activity of ATP synthesis of this cross-linked enzyme was fully retained (26Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been established that ϵ can adopt at least two conformational states, i.e. the down-state in which C-terminal helices form a hairpin and the up-state in which the helices are extended. Only the ϵ subunit in the up-state can exert an inhibitory effect on ATPase activity. Although the importance of the conformational transition of ϵ has been thus recognized, the following critical questions on this transition remain unanswered. (i) What is the actual up-state conformation of ϵ in native F0F1? The present knowledge on the up-state conformation of ϵ is largely based on the crystal structure of the γ′ϵ complex. However, it is obvious that truncated γ′ imposes an artificial constraint on the conformation of ϵ (as well as γ) in the γ′ϵ structure. Indeed, if the extreme C-terminal helix of ϵ were to have the same conformation as in the γ′ϵ, it would clash sterically with the closest β subunit. In addition, in the model reconstituted from the α3β3γ part of the mitochondrial F1 structure and the γ′ϵ structure, ϵSer108 in the γ′ϵ is apparently too far from βGlu381 to account for efficient cross-linking (Fig. 1C). In a 4.4-Å resolution electron density map of E. coli F1, the first α helix of the ϵ subunit in the extended conformation was barely seen as continuous density, but the second α helix was unable to be traced (27Hausrath A.C. Capaldi R.A. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47227-47232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformation and arrangement of the up-state ϵ in intact F0F1 is yet unclear. (ii) What is the effect of ATP and ADP on the conformational transition of ϵ in F0F1? In E. coli F1, depending on whether the added nucleotide is ATP or ADP, the same residue of the ϵE108C changes the cross-linking partner subunit; ϵ-α in Mg2+ + ATP state (in the presence of MgCl2 + 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate) and ϵ-β in the Mg2+ + ADP state (20Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 28Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the individual roles of ATP and ADP were not obvious for F1 from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 in our previous paper (19Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The distinct role of ATP and ADP in the conformational transition of the ϵ must be clarified. (iii) Do the enzyme with the up-state ϵ and the enzyme with the down-state ϵ have different affinities to ATP and ADP? If ATP and ADP have different effects on the conformational transition of ϵ, binding affinity to ATP and ADP, conversely, might be different between the enzyme with the up-state ϵ and the enzyme with the down-state ϵ. (iv) Does the proton motive force affect the transition of ϵ? Because the enzyme with the up-state ϵ can apparently catalyze ATP synthesis but not ATP hydrolysis, the enzyme with the up-state ϵ can be regarded as the enzyme species geared to the ATP synthesis mode. If so, it is natural to expect that proton motive force would facilitate the down-to-up transition of the ϵ subunit. To address these questions, we generated a new set of F0F1 mutants from thermophilic Bacillus PS3 that enabled us to detect and fix the down- and up-states of ϵ in the working enzyme. Preparation of the Enzymes—Plasmids for three F0F1 mutants, γcϵc-F0F1 (γS3C, ϵCys134), γcϵcc-F0F1 (γS3C, ϵA85C, ϵCys134), and ϵcc-F0F1 (ϵA85C, ϵCys134), were constructed from the plasmid pTR19-ASDS (29Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) by the Mega-primer method (30Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Sequences of the regions amplified by PCR were verified by nucleotide sequencing. These plasmids were used for transformation of an E. coli strain DK8 (bglR, thi-1, rel-1, HfrPO1, Δ(uncB-uncC), ilv:Tn10) that lacked whole F0F1 genes. F1 (α3β3γδϵ complex) of thermophilic Bacillus strain PS3 was purified as follows. E. coli cells (DK8/pTR19-ASDS) expressing thermophilic F0F1 were disrupted in PA3-buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) (29Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the cytosol fraction was obtained by removing a membrane fraction with centrifugation (150,000 × g for 20 min). The supernatant was incubated at 67 °C for 15 min, and aggregated E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation (150,000 × g for 20 min). A yellow supernatant was supplemented with 2 volumes of 20 mm KPi buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm KCl and 50 mm imidazole and applied on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing the column with 10 volumes of the buffer, F1 was eluted with 20 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 200 mm imidazole, and DTT (final concentration, 50 mm) was added to the eluted fraction. After incubation for 60 min at 25 °C, ammonium sulfate was added to the solution (final concentration, 1 m), and the solution was applied to a phenyl-Toyopearl 650 m column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 20 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 20 volumes of 100 mm KPi buffer, pH 7.5, containing 4 mm EDTA and 1 m ammonium sulfate to remove endogenously bound nucleotides, and a linear reverse gradient of ammonium sulfate (1–0 M) was applied. Fractions containing F1 were collected, precipitated with ammonium sulfate, and further purified with a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm HEPES/KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl. The purified protein was frozen with liquid N2 and stored at–80 °C until use. The purified γcϵc-F1, γcϵcc-F1 and ϵcc-F1 contained 0.096 ± 0.01, 0.18 ± 0.02, and 0.18 ± 0.02 mol of ADP per mol of F1, respectively. Assays of Membrane Vesicles—Inverted membrane vesicles from E. coli cells expressing thermophilic F0F1 were prepared by the procedures described previously (29Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) except for a modification in which 5 mm DTT was supplemented to the cell extract just after disruption of the cells. The thermophilic F0F1 used in this work has a histidine tag of 10 residues at the N terminus of the β subunit. Prior to use, the membrane vesicles were washed twice with PA3 buffer to remove DTT. ATPase activities of the membrane vesicles containing the F0F1 mutants were inactivated by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide down to < 20% of the initial activities, which were almost the same as in the case of the wild-type (15–20%). ATP-driven proton pump activity of membrane vesicles was assayed with fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine at 40 °C in PA4 buffer (10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2) as described previously (29Suzuki T. Ueno H. Mitome N. Suzuki J. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13281-13285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm ATP and terminated by the addition of 1 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP). ATP synthesis activity was measured at 50 °C in PA4-buffer containing 1 mm ADP, 25 mm KPi, pH 7.5, and membrane vesicles (4.5 μg of protein/ml). Oxidized and reduced membrane vesicles were prepared by treating with 20 μm CuCl2 for 30 min and 10 mm DTT for 30 min, respectively. EDTA (final concentration, 1 mm) was added to the oxidized vesicle solution prior to the assay of ATP synthesis to chelate free Cu2+. EDTA was also added to the reduced vesicle solution to adjust the conditions. After a 5-min preincubation, the reaction was initiated by adding 5 mm NADH and terminated at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 min by adding 2.5% trichloroacetic acid. The solution was neutralized to pH 7.7 with 0.25 m Tris acetate (pH 9.5), and the amount of synthesized ATP was determined with ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLSII (Roche Applied Science). Other Assays—ATPase activity was monitored in triplicate in 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm ATP with an ATP-regenerating system (31Suzuki T. Suzuki J. Mitome N. Ueno H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37902-37906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and average hydrolysis rates in a time period from 3 to 6 min after initiation of the reactions at 40 °C were measured. The activity that hydrolyzed 1 μmol of ATP per minute was defined as one unit. 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ATP (TNP-ATP) and 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-ADP (TNP-ADP) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescence change induced by the binding of TNP-nucleotide to the enzyme was monitored in a Spectrofluorometer model FP-6500 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) as performed previously (32Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24906-24912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Mutants—We generated three mutants. To obtain the enzyme with the up-fixed ϵ by cross-linking between γ and ϵ, one cysteine residue was introduced into the N-terminal region of the γ subunit (γS3C) and another was added to the C-terminal end of ϵ subunit (ϵCys134) (Fig. 1D). To obtain the enzyme with the down-fixed ϵ by cross-linking two domains within ϵ, a mutant that had ϵA85C and ϵCys134 was used (Fig. 1E). To assess the relative population of enzymes with up- and down-state ϵ under various conditions, three mutations, γS3C, ϵA85C and ϵCys134 were introduced. The ϵAla85 is located in a region between two domains of ϵ and abuts on ϵCys134 (Cα distance is 9.0 Å) when the C-terminal domain adopts a hairpin structure (14Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, ϵCys134 is expected to make the cross-link with γS3C when the ϵ is in the up-state or with ϵA85C when the ϵ is in the down-state (Fig. 1F). These mutations were termed γcϵc, ϵcc, and γcϵcc, respectively. The enzymes have one endogenous cysteine residue in the F0a subunit. This cysteine is buried inside of the transmembrane region and does not respond to the CuCl2 and 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitro)benzoic acid (DTNB) treatment employed in this report. The enzymes containing γcϵc, ϵcc, and γcϵcc were as active as the wild-type enzyme in their reduced forms (Table I). Also ATPase activities of the inverted membrane vesicles prepared from the cells expressing the wild-type and the F0F1 mutants were similar to each other under the reducing conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis of the membrane vesicles showed almost identical band patterns for the three mutants and the wild-type (not shown). Therefore, the amounts of expressed mutant F0F1 in the inverted membranes are similar to that of the wild-type F0F1.Table IATPase activity of the wild-type and mutant F1 and F0F1EnzymesaReduced form of the enzymes was used for the analysis.ATPase activitybATPase activity was determined at 40 °C in the presence of 3 mm ATP.

Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6560-6564Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), cysteine residues were introduced at positions γ99 and ϵ118 (E. coli numbering) to fix the conformation of ϵ in the up-state by a γ-ϵ cross-link. These positions were chosen based on the crystal structure of the γ′ϵ complex in which γ99 is located in the globular domain of γ′ and ϵ118 is in the extreme C-terminal helix of ϵ. In this structure, two helices do not fully extend but rather entwine the globular domain of γ′ (Fig. 1C). Expecting that helices of the up-state ϵ in the native enzyme could extend straighter, we introduced cysteine residues to a near N-terminal position of γ (γSer3) atop the central helical coiled-coil of the γ subunit and to the C terminus of ϵ (ϵ134) (Fig. 1D). The membrane vesicles of E. coli expressing γcϵc-F0F1 were oxidized in 20 μm CuCl2 for 20 min at 25 °C and analyzed with non-reducing SDS-PAGE (SDS-PAGE without prior reducing treatment) (Fig. 2A). Compared with a control γcϵc-F0F1, which was treated with 50 mm DTT prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 2A, lane 1), a new band appeared just below the band of the β subunit (Fig. 2A, lane 4, indicated by an arrow). Peptide sequencing of this band gave two kinds of amino acid sequences corresponding to the N terminus sequences of γ and ϵ, indicating that this band is a cross-link product of these two subunits. Consistently, band intensities of γ and ϵ decreased. The same γ-ϵ cross-link product was also readily generated in the purified γcϵc-F1 under the same oxidizing conditions (Fig. 2A, lane 5). Cross-linking yields in the F1 and F0F1 were estimated from the band intensities to be 80–85%. It is worth noting that γ-ϵ cross-link was generated spontaneously in ∼40% of F1 during the purification (2 days) that was carried out without DTT and EDTA. Also, ∼60% of F0F1 in membrane vesicles were spontaneously oxidized during preparation. The efficient cross-linking between γS3C and ϵCys134 suggests that their proximal location is in the up-state conformation of ϵ in F1 and F0F1 and that the C-terminal helix of ϵ inserts itself deep into the central cavity of the α3β3. Because the isolated γcϵc-F1 used in the above experiments was mostly free from endogenous nucleotide, the ϵ mostly adopts the up-state in the absence of bound nucleotides. Activities of F1 and F0F1 with the Up-fixed ϵ —The ATPase activity of γcϵc-F1 was severely inhibited by oxidation with its residual activity being only 21% of that of the reduced γcϵc-F1, whereas the ATPase activity of the wild-type F1 was hardly affected whether it was oxidized or reduced (Fig. 2B, left panel). The degree of inhibition by oxidation (79%) agreed well with the yield of cross-link by oxidation (81%). Similarly, the ATPase activity of the γcϵc-F0F1 contained in the vesicles was inhibited (77%) in proportion to the yield of cross-linking (80%) (Fig. 2B, right panel). Because ATP hydrolysis was blocked, oxidized γcϵc-F0F1 was unable to mediate ATP-driven proton translocation, whereas reduced γcϵc-F0F1 was fully capable of it (Fig. 2C). ATP synthesis activities of membrane vesicles containing reduced or oxidized γcϵc-F0F1 were also measured. Membrane vesicles containing the wild-type and γcϵc-F0F1 treated with DTT catalyzed ATP synthesis at 44.5 ± 2.8 and 34.7 ± 2.4 nmol of ATP/min/mg of membrane protein, respectively. Oxidized vesicles showed 71% (wild-type) and 75% (γcϵc-F0F1) of the ATP synthesis activity of the vesicles treated with DTT (Fig. 2D). Thus, ATP synthesis activity was retained after the formation of the γ-ϵ cross-link to lock the ϵ in the up-state. These results are consistent with the previous reports, demonstrating remarkable asymmetric inhibition by the up-state ϵ toward ATP hydrolysis (18Schulenberg B. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28351-28355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Tsunoda S.P. Rodgers A.J.W. Aggeler R. Wilce M.C.J. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Effect of ATP and ADP on the Conformational State of ϵ —To assess the distribution of the ϵ either in the up-state or down-state, γcϵcc-F1 and γcϵcc-F0F1 were used. With oxidation procedures, the down-state ϵ can be detected as a band corresponding to an internally cross-linked ϵ (ϵA85C and ϵC134) and the up-state ϵ as a γ-ϵ band (γS3C and ϵCys134). The ϵ subunit behaved very similarly in γcϵcc-F1 and γcϵcc-F0F1 (Fig. 3, A and B). In the absence of nucleotides, the ϵ in F1 and in F0F1 was mostly in the up-state (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 2), and the up-state conformation was stabilized when 3 mm ADP was present (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3). 2We reported previously that ADP, though less effective than ATP, induced the down-state conformation of the ϵ subunit in the α3β3γϵ complex (19Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When we used ADP pretreated with hexokinase and glucose in the experiment, the down-state conformation was not detected. Therefore, contaminated ATP in the commercial ADP might be the reason for the previous result. The further addition of 5 mm Pi caused no significant change (not shown). However, the γ-ϵ band disappeared, and the internally cross-linked ϵ band (Fig. 3, A and B, arrowheads) appeared when ADP was converted into ATP by pyruvate kinase (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 4). Also, the internally cross-linked ϵ band appeared when ATP was added from the beginning (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5). The addition of hexokinase and glucose to the sample of the lanes 5 (Fig. 3, A and B) resulted in the appearance of the γ-ϵ band (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 6). Thus, it is clear that the ϵ subunit in F1 and F0F1 adopts reversibly the up-state conformation in the presence of ADP and the down-state conformation in the presence of ATP. As shown previously (19Kato-Yamada Y. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35746-35750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), hydrolysis of ATP is not necessary to stabilize the down-state ϵ, because 3 mm AMP-PNP also stabilized the down-state conformation of ϵ (not shown). TNP-AT(D)P Binding to F1 with Up- or Down-state ϵ —It has been known that a nucleotide analogue, TNP-AT(D)P, increases its fluorescence upon binding to F1 (32Kato Y. Matsui T. Tanaka N. Muneyuki E.

Taking advantage of this, we compared initial kinetics of nucleotide binding to the enzymes that contained the up- or down-state ϵ.

The cDNA encoded the metastasis suppressor gene KiSS-1. KiSS-1 protein was shown to form a complex with pro-MMP. KiSS-1 protein is known to be processed to peptide ligand of a G-protein-coupled receptor (hOT7T175) named metastin, and suppresses metastasis of tumors expressing the receptor. Active MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP cleaved the Gly118-Leu119 peptide bond of not only full-length KiSS-1 protein but also metastin decapeptide. Metastin decapeptide induced formation of focal adhesion and actin stress fibers in cells expressing the receptor, and digestion of metastin decapeptide by MMP abolished its ligand activity. Migration of HT1080 cells expressing hOT7T175 that harbor a high-level MMP activity was only slightly suppressed by either metastin decapeptide or MMP inhibitor BB-94 alone, but the combination of metastin decapeptide and BB-94 showed a synergistic effect in blocking cell migration. We propose that metastin could be used as an antimetastatic agent in combination with MMP inhibitor, or MMP-resistant forms of metastin could be developed and may also be efficacious."

However, it was not clear whether the two domains, RPA70A and RPA70B, bind DNA simultaneously or sequentially. Here, using primarily heteronuclear NMR complemented by fluorescence spectroscopy, we have analyzed the binding characteristics of the individual RPA70A and RPA70B domains and compared them with the intact RPA70AB. NMR chemical shift comparisons confirmed that RPA70A and RPA70B tumble independently in solution in the absence of ssDNA. NMR chemical shift perturbations showed that all ssDNA oligomers bind to the same sites as observed in the x-ray crystal structure of RPA70AB complexed to d(C)8. Titrations using a variety of 5′-mer ssDNA oligomers showed that RPA70A has a 5–10-fold higher affinity for ssDNA than RPA70B. Detailed analysis of ssDNA binding to RPA70A revealed that all DNA sequences interact in a similar mode. Fluorescence binding measurements with a variety of 8–10′-mer DNA sequences showed that RPA70AB interacts with DNA with ∼100-fold higher affinity than the isolated domains. Calculation of the theoretical “linkage effect” from the structure of RPA70AB suggests that the high overall affinity for ssDNA is a byproduct of the covalent attachment of the two domains via a short flexible tether, which increases the effective local concentration.

Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins are required to organize and protect exposed ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, human replication protein A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, human replication protein A; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. in all of these pathways. The single-stranded DNA-binding protein function in eukaryotes is carried out by the heterotrimeric replication protein A (RPA). The three subunits (RPA70, RPA32, RPA14), named according to their respective molecular weights, are highly conserved, and all are required for function (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 2Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures determined by NMR and x-ray crystallography have been obtained for all RPA domains, but the overall quaternary structure of the trimer is not yet known. A schematic representation of the domain organization of RPA is presented in Fig. 1. The N- and C-terminal regions of RPA70 (RPA701–110, RPA70N; RPA70436–616, RPA70C), the central region of RPA70 (RPA70181–422, RPA70AB), the central domain of RPA32 (RPA3243–171, RPA32D), and RPA14 all adopt an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold, a structure common to other known single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (3Jacobs D.M.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of RPA32 (RPA32205–270, RPA32C) contains a winged helix-loop-helix domain (8Mer G. Bochkarev A. Gupta R.

Binding of ssDNA is carried out by RPA70A (RPA70181–291), RPA70B (RPA70298–422), RPA70C, and RPA32D. RPA70N and RPA32C do not contribute to DNA binding but are involved in protein-protein interactions with other DNA replication, recombination, and repair proteins (1Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 9Mer G. Bochkarev A. Chazin W.J. Edwards A.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). There is a measurable preference for polypyrimidine over polypurine sequences, as indicated by a 50–100-fold stronger binding constant (11Kim C. Snyder R.O. Wold M.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3050-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The domain arrangement is dictated by the polarity of the ssDNA, with domains A through D binding from the 5′- to the 3′-end of a given sequence (12Kolpashchikov D.M. Khodyreva S.N. Khlimankov D.Y.

Each heterotrimer binds in three stages, with occlusion lengths of 8–10, then 13–14, and finally ∼30 nucleotides (15Lavrik O.I. Kolpashchikov D.M. Weisshart K. Nasheuer H.P. Khodyreva S.N. Favre A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The initial stage of binding has been attributed to the tandem high affinity domains RPA70AB (7Bochkareva E. Korolev S. Lees-Miller S.P. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1855-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the individual A and B domains bind DNA simultaneously or sequentially. The x-ray crystal structure of RPA70AB in complex with d(C)8 has provided some fundamental insights into the binding of ssDNA (4Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The most striking feature was the observation of base-specific contacts between the protein and DNA. These include a network of hydrogen bonds and base stacking interactions of conserved aromatic residues in L12 and L45 loops in both domains. These base-specific contacts are seemingly inconsistent with the need for RPA to bind ssDNA regardless of sequence information. A hypothesis has been proposed to explain sequence non-specific binding of ssDNA by RPA70AB, which invokes dynamic remodeling of the binding sites in accord with the combination of bases (17Bhattacharya S. Botuyan M.V. Hsu F. Shan X. Arunkumar A.I. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2316-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we extend previous analyses of the ssDNA binding by RPA by characterizing the binding properties of the isolated domains of RPA70A and RPA70B and then comparing them with the corresponding analyses of the intact RPA70AB domain. Heteronuclear NMR and complementary fluorescence experiments were used to monitor binding events and the structural effects of binding on RPA70AB. The data are consistent with a sequential model of DNA binding by RPA, wherein the pathway is ordered perforce by the linkage effect rather than by explicit cooperative interactions. Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant RPA70A (RPA70181–291) and RPA70B (RPA70298–422) were constructed in a pET15b vector (Invitrogen), which incorporates an N-terminal His tag containing a thrombin cleavage site. The RPA70AB (RPA70181–422) construct has been described previously (18Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkarev A. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 430-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). RPA70A and RPA70B were expressed in the Escherichia coli host BL21 (DE3) pLys(S), and RPA70AB was expressed in ROSETTA BL21 (DE3) cells (Novagen, Madison, WI). Unlabeled proteins were prepared using LB medium containing ampicillin (or carbenecillin in the case of RPA70AB) at 37 °C. Uniform 15N- and 13C, 15N-labeled protein was produced in a similar manner except that M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and unlabeled or [13C6]glucose was used as the sole nitrogen and carbon source. Proteins were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The His tag was cleaved off for RPA70A and RPA70B but retained in the case of RPA70AB for stability reasons. Further purification was achieved using Superdex-75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column. The final yield is 15–20 mg/liter of culture for RPA70A and RPA70B and ∼8 mg/liter for RPA70AB. The yield of the protein under labeling conditions dropped by ∼50%. Purity and homogeneity of all samples were tested using SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography-purified ssDNA samples were purchased from Midland Certified Co., Midland, TX and used without further purification. All other chemicals were of molecular biology grade. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed on Bruker spectrometers operating at 600 or 800 MHz. The buffer used for all NMR experiments was 20 mm Tris-d11 HCl containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% NaN3 at pH 7.2. All NMR experiments were recorded at 25 °C. Two-dimensional, gradient-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired on uniformly 15N-labeled samples of RPA70A, RPA70B, and RPA70AB in 90% H2O/10%D2O (19Zhang O. Kay L.E. Olivier J.P. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 845-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). The backbone amide proton and nitrogen chemical shifts of intact RPA70AB were assigned by comparison with the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the individual domains. This strategy was based on the observation that the two domains are structurally independent (see below). A standard set of triple resonance experiments was acquired for the backbone and side chain assignments of RPA70A and RPA70B (20Cavanaugh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of RPA70AB with the backbone assignments is presented as supplementary figure S1. Complete backbone and side chain assignments for RPA70A, RPA70B, and RPA70AB will be reported elsewhere (21Bhattacharya, S., Arunkumar, A. I., Sullivan, S., Botuyan, M. V., Arrowsmith, C. H., and Chazin, W. J. (2003) J. Biomol. NMR, in pressGoogle Scholar). All NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix 2000 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). ssDNA Titrations by NMR—The following titrations were carried out: (i) RPA70A with d(CTTCA), d(C)5, and d(T5); (ii) RPA70B with d(CTTCA), d(C)5, and d(T)5; (iii) RPA70AB with d(CTTCA), d(C)10, and d(CTTCACTTCA). The protein concentration used was between 0.15 and 0.35 mm. Aliquots of ssDNA were added to the protein and equilibrated for 5 min before acquiring 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The pH of the NMR samples was monitored during the titration, and there was no significant change in the pH at the end of each titration (within ± 0.2 units). Changes in average amide chemical shifts (Δδavg) were calculated using Δδavg=ΔδN52+ΔδH22(Eq. 1) where ΔδN and ΔδH are the amide nitrogen and amide proton chemical shift difference between the free and the bound states of the protein (22Hall D.A. Vander Kooi C.W. Stasik C.N. Stevens S.Y. Zuiderweg E.R. Matthews R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9521-9526Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). NMR chemical shift changes were fit using the same procedure that was followed to fit the fluorescence binding curves. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—RPA70A and RPA70B each contain two tryptophans. Importantly, one tryptophan in each domain is exposed to solvent and directly involved in the DNA binding (Trp-212 and Trp-361 in A and B, respectively), whereas the others, Trp-197 and Trp-414, are buried and far from the binding site. The location of residues in the binding site suggested that analysis of the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence could be used to monitor the binding of ssDNA within each domain, and experiments reported here confirm the validity of this approach. Steady-state fluorescence experiments were done using a SPEX FLUOROMAX spectrofluorimeter. Emission spectra were recorded by scanning between 305 and 400 nm with the excitation wavelength for tryptophan set at 285 nm. Excitation and emission slit widths were set to 4 nm. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at ambient temperatures in a 160-μl-volume quartz cuvette using a protein concentration of 10–20 μm. The buffer used for fluorescence experiments was 20 mm HEPES containing 50 mm KCl and 10 mm MgCl2 at pH 7.2. Titrations were performed by the addition of aliquots of ssDNA from a concentrated stock solution. The overall volume change during the titration was ≤5% of the total reaction volume and was corrected in the final analysis. At each titration point, the sample was incubated for 2 min before recording the spectra. The changes in the fluorescence intensity were measured at the maximum intensity (λmax) of 337 nm for RPA70AB, 333 nm for RPA70A, and 343 nm for RPA70B, respectively. Fluorescence intensities were fit using KaleidaGraph 3.5 (Synergy Software) to a simple bimolecular binding model through non-linear regression analysis using Equation 2, F=F0+(Fmax-F0)2Dt[(Pt+Dt+Kd)-(Pt+Dt+Kd)2-4·PtDt](Eq. 2) where F is the observed fluorescence intensity, F 0 is the fluorescence intensity of free protein, and F max is the fluorescence intensity of protein bound to DNA. Pt is the total concentration of protein, Dt is the total concentration of DNA, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the complex. In the final equation, both the starting and the end points of the titration were normalized between 0 and 1, hence F 0 becomes 0 and F max is 1. The binding constants reported in this study were determined using a protein concentration within the measurable range of Kd values as suggested by simulated binding curves. NMR experiments could be used to determine Kd values in the range 2–40 μm, and fluorescence could be used to determine Kd values in the 50 nm to 5 μm range. Local Concentration (Linkage) Effect—The local concentration effect was calculated based on modeling the system as a wormlike chain following the procedure published by Zhou (23Zhou H.X. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15069-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The linker length is 27 residues for RPA70AB. The end-to-end distance measured in the crystal structure (33.7 Å) was used for this calculation. A and B Are Structurally Independent Domains—The x-ray crystal structure of RPA70AB in the presence of d(C)8 revealed that although the two domains are aligned, there are actually very few contacts between them (4Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In the absence of ssDNA, the two domains are no longer aligned, and no interdomain contacts are observed (5Bochkareva E. Belegu V. Korolev S. Bochkarev A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In fact, one of the molecules in the unit cell has only partial electron density for the linker between the two domains. To properly interpret the DNA binding properties of RPA70AB, it is important to establish whether this high affinity ssDNA binding region of the protein is comprised of one or two independent functional units. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we analyzed RPA70AB by NMR in the absence of DNA, as well as constructed expression systems, and produced the isolated RPA70A and RPA70B domains so that a series of biophysical studies could be made. Intact RPA70AB and the isolated domains all provide high quality NMR spectra. A small region from the 1H, 15N HSQC spectra of RPA70AB and of the sum of the corresponding spectra of the individual domains (RPA70A, RPA70B) is shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively. For each cross-peak in the spectra of RPA70AB, there is a corresponding peak in the spectral overlay of the individual domains. This shows that there is no difference in the structure of the two domains whether they are in isolation or tethered by a linker. Similar observations have shown that RPA70N tumbles independently of RPA70A and is connected by a long flexible linker (24Daughdrill G.W. Ackerman J. Isern N.G. Botuyan M.V. Arrowsmith C. Wold M.S. Lowry D.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3270-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Corresponding NMR spectra for RPA70AB and the two isolated domains in the presence of ssDNA (Fig. 2, C and D) proved to be particularly informative. The spectra of RPA70AB were obtained in the presence of d(CTTCACTTCA), which covers its entire binding region. For comparison, the spectra of the individual domains were acquired with the half-oligomer, d(CTTCA). Interestingly, the peak positions of the individual domains are very similar to those of the intact RPA70AB bound to ssDNA. This suggests that there is no significant difference between the conformation of the individual domains in isolation and their conformation in the context of the intact RPA70AB, either in the absence or in the presence of ssDNA. These results show that although binding ssDNA requires their coordinated activities, the binding properties of RPA70AB can be analyzed in terms of two structural domains that are flexibly, not statically, linked. Since there is no direct structural coupling apparent between the two functional domains, a detailed examination of the relative binding characteristics of the isolated domains could be made. The RPA70A Domain Binds ssDNA with Higher Affinity Than the RPA70B Domain—Both NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to monitor the relative binding of ssDNA by the A and B domains. A five-nucleotide oligomer, d(CTTCA), which covers a single binding site, was used for these experiments. Upon titration of the DNA into a solution of 15N-enriched protein, a subset of cross-peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum is perturbed, indicating binding in a discrete binding site on the protein. The availability of sequence-specific resonance assignments allowed the ssDNA binding site to be determined in each case. As expected, the results obtained were fully consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of the complex of RPA70AB with d(C)8, in which residues in the L12 and L45 loops (Trp-212–Glu-218, Lys-263–Glu-275) and part of the β3 region (Arg-234–Phe-238) are in direct contact with DNA in each domain and with RPA70A and RPA70B oriented toward the 5′- and 3′-end of DNA, respectively (4Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The NMR chemical shifts of RPA70A, RPA70B, and RPA70AB are perturbed as d(CTTCA) is titrated into the solution. The observation of fast exchange for all perturbed residues greatly facilitated the assignment of the NMR chemical shifts in the DNA-bound state by starting with the complete assignments for the free protein and simply tracking the small shifts in resonances at each step of the titration. A binding curve for representative residues shows significant chemical shift changes upon the addition of increasing amounts of d(CTTCA) (Fig. 3). As seen in Fig. 3A, binding of d(CTTCA) to RPA70A saturated around a 1:1 molar ratio of DNA to protein, indicating 1:1 stoichiometry. An upper limit on Kd of 2 μm was estimated using the 5 residues showing the largest total chemical shift change (Glu-218, Ala-237, Phe-238, Gln-268, Ala-271). This NMR measurement is fully consistent with the value of 1.7 ± 0.8 μm determined by fluorescence spectroscopy (data not shown). Interestingly, the titrations for RPA70B show that the binding is weaker as reflected in the initial slope of the binding curve and saturation at a higher DNA:protein ratio (Fig. 3B). An average Kd of 16.8 ± 3.2 μm was derived from the 5 residues showing the largest total chemical shift change (Ser-336, Arg-382, Phe-386, Arg-389, Leu-391, Ser-395). These data reveal a small but significant (8-fold) difference in the binding affinities of isolated RPA70A and RPA70B for d(CTTCA). A corresponding NMR titration of d(CTTCA) into a solution of 15N-enriched RPA70AB was also carried out. A good correlation is found between the peaks appearing in the NMR spectrum of the DNA-saturated protein and the corresponding peaks in the spectra of the isolated domains saturated with DNA (Fig. 2), consistent with the functional independence of the two domains. The chemical shift changes from a representative set of residues from both the A and the B domains are shown in Fig. 3C. The binding curves represent the summation of two simultaneous independent binding events, and in particular, enable a direct observation of the relative affinities of the two domains. The binding curves for the residues from the A domain appear monophasic. In contrast, residues from the B domain clearly show two phases of binding. These data reflect ssDNA loading preferentially into the A domain, which is saturated before the B domain is even half-loaded. This provides a clear and direct evidence of the higher intrinsic binding affinity of the A domain even in the context of the tandem domain, RPA70AB. Common Binding Mode—To establish that the observed difference in affinity of RPA70A and RPA70B is a general phenomenon and not an artifact specific to d(CTTCA), the experiments were repeated with d(C)5 and d(T)5. As anticipated, the results obtained for this oligomer were the same within the limits of experimental error (data not shown). NMR chemical shift analysis was also carried out to monitor the effect on the structure of RPA70A upon binding to various 5-mer sequences. The NMR spectra of RPA70A bound to d(C)5 or d(T)5 shows a striking resemblance to that observed for a mixed sequence such as d(CTTCA) (Fig. 4). A similar result was observed when d(C)10 or d(CTTCACTTCA) was titrated with RPA70AB (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the protein adopts a very similar structure upon binding to different ssDNA molecules. However, as shown in Fig. 5, there are also some specific differences in the magnitude of the chemical shift change upon binding to various sequences. For example, the peak for Ala-237 in RPA70A changes significantly upon binding to d(C)5 and d(CTTCA) but only very little when bound to d(T)5, whereas the peak for Ala-271 shows significant changes upon binding to all the three sequences. These localized changes are due to the adaptation of side chains to different DNA sequences, as proposed previously (17Bhattacharya S. Botuyan M.V. Hsu F. Shan X. Arunkumar A.I. Arrowsmith C.H. Edwards A.M. Chazin W.J. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2316-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and are also presumably responsible for the higher affinity of RPA70A for ssDNA.Fig. 5Differential effects on the structure of RPA70A side chains upon binding to different ssDNA oligomers.

Consequently, the studies of binding of the d(CTTCA) oligomer to RPA70AB described above provide information only on the relative intrinsic affinities of the two domains and not on the overall binding properties of RPA70AB. Since the A and B domains of RPA70AB are linked to each other by a tether, their binding of DNA is perforce coordinated. The well defined relative orientation of the two domains in the x-ray crystal structure of the DNA complex clearly points to coordinated binding, although the dearth of contacts between the two domains suggests little if any cooperativity between the two domains. To confirm that this specific arrangement of the domains is not simply a byproduct of the rather short length (8 nucleotides) of the DNA oligomer required for crystallization, the binding affinities for d(C)8 and d(C)10 were measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and the structure of the corresponding complexes compared by heteronuclear solution NMR. Attempts at determining the DNA binding affinities of RPA70AB by NMR were stymied by exchange effects on the intermediate NMR time scale, which results in broadened resonances that are not observable in the middle of the titration. There is, however, a clear quenching of intrinsic RPA70AB tryptophan fluorescence accompanied by a small but distinct blue shift upon binding DNA (Fig. 6, A and B). Fitting of the curves to a simple binding equation results in dissociation constants of 52 ± 16 nm, 44 ± 12 nm, and 114 ± 32 nm for the d(C)8, d(C)10, and d(CTTCACTTCA), respectively. These are >100-fold stronger than the values of 2–10 μm for the DNA 5-mers. The Kd value measured for d(C)8 is similar to the value of 10 nm determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (18Pfuetzner R.A. Bochkarev A. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 430-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). No uncertainties were provided for the latter experiments, but if the differences in these values are real, they are presumably due to the differences in the experimental conditions and the type of oligonucleotides used in these studies (in the latter case, 5′-phosphorylated d(C)8 was used, whereas in the present study, the oligonucleotides were not phosphorylated). The similarity of the Kd values of d(C)8 and d(C)10 confirms that the isolated tandem RPA70AB domains specifically interact with a segment of 8 nucleotides, regardless of the length of the oligonucleotide presented. Detailed comparison of characteristic backbone and side chain 1H, 15N, and 13C NMR chemical shifts shows that there are no differences in the corresponding structures of RPA70AB. In addition to the dC homo-oligomers, corresponding experiments were carried out on d(CTTCACTTCA), and essentially identical binding affinities (Fig. 6) and chemical shift changes in the spectrum were observed. Local Concentration, the Linkage Effect—What factors lead to the observed ∼100-fold difference in the affinity of ssDNA depending on whether or not the two domains of RPA70AB are linked? Allosteric coupling in systems with multiple binding sites is well known; is the binding of ssDNA to RPA70AB cooperative? To evaluate cooperativity in a system such as RPA70AB, it is essential to consider the intrinsic contribution to binding affinity due to the covalent linkage of the two domains. In essence, attachment leads to an increased local concentration of the two domains, relative to the free diffusion of independent molecules. To determine this “linkage effect,” we have used the formalism of Zhou (23Zhou H.X. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15069-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which is based on polymer theory and assumes that the flexible linker can be modeled as a worm-like chain with minimal interference between the linker and the domains. A schematic diagram representing this model and the thermodynamic equilibrium involved for the RPA70AB system is presented in Fig. 7. Using this formalism, the local concentration p(d0) for RPA70AB was calculated to be 2.3 mm. This value agrees well with the local concentration that can be derived from comparison of the experimentally determined dissociation constants for the individual domains (RPA70A and RPA70B) in complex with d(CTTCA) (i.e. in the absence of linker, KA and KB) and the intact RPA70AB domain in complex with d(CTTCACTTCA) (KAB). This conclusion is consistent with our structural comparisons of RPA70AB by NMR, which show that the two domains are structurally independent both in the absence and in the presence of DNA. These results imply that although they function in a coordinated fashion, there is no significant cooperativity when the two domains interact with DNA. Concluding Remarks—The experiments reported in this study provide insights into the coordinated ssDNA binding activities of the RPA70A and RPA70B domains, as well as the similarity in the mode of binding of different DNA sequences. To facilitate the comparisons of complexes with different sequences and with the crystal structure of the d(C)8 complex, the ssDNA oligomers used in this study were all pyrimidine-rich. A corresponding analysis of purine-rich and mixed purine-pyrimidine sequences is clearly necessary to obtain a complete picture of the RPA70AB DNA binding properties and refine our hypotheses. These and additional crystallographic studies should also shed light on the molecular basis for the higher apparent affinity of RPA for polypyrimidine versus polypurine DNA. RPA uses four oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold domains to bind ssDNA. The tandem domain, RPA70AB, contributes over 80% of the overall affinity of RPA to ssDNA. The A domain has higher intrinsic affinity for ssDNA than the others, but the short linker to the B domain ensures that the binding activities of the tandem domains are coordinated, resulting in high overall affinity. The RPA70B and RPA70C domains are also connected by a relatively short linker (residues ∼422–436), and it will be important to determine whether this linker plays a similar role. Our data regarding the difference in binding affinity of domains A and B correlates with mutational analysis results. In vitro, inactivation of RPA70A (by mutating the 2 conserved stacking aromatic residues) eliminated RPA binding to a short substrate (25Bastin-Shanower S.A. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36446-36453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, similar inactivation in RPA70B only reduced the binding. In vivo, a single mutation of the conserved stacking aromatics (Phe-238 to Ala), which inactivates RPA70A, was lethal for yeast. In contrast, a mutation of structurally similar Trp-361 in RPA70B was not lethal (26Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Overall, our data support a sequential model of DNA binding in which the major pathway involves RPA70A providing the initial interaction with the 5′-end of ssDNA, followed by B, C, and D domains, which generates 5′ → 3′ polarity. We believe this pathway is ordered perforce by the linkage effect rather than by explicit cooperative interactions, i.e. if the initial interaction occurs with RPA70A, the DNA is held in close proximity and with the correct polarity to the adjacent RPA70B domain. Linkage of the A and B domains ensures coordination of their DNA binding activities. The fact that the calculation of the linkage effect using a highly simplified model agrees with the observed increase in affinity for the linked relative to the isolated domains is consistent with the two domains functioning as independent domains. Results from experiments to test and refine this hypothesis will be reported on in due course. We thank Markus Voehler and Dr. Jaison Jacob for assistance in acquisition of NMR data. Drs. H.

https://openalex.org/W1971836864,"The RAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signal transduction cascade is an important mediator of a number of cellular fates including growth, proliferation and survival. The BRAF gene, one of the human isoforms of RAF, is activated by oncogenic RAS, leading to cooperative effects in cells responding to growth factor signals. This study was performed to elucidate a possible function of BRAF in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Mutations of BRAF and KRAS2 were evaluated in 89 HNSCC and corresponding normal mucosa by direct DNA sequencing analyses after microdissection. The results obtained were correlated with histopathological variables. Activating BRAF missense mutations were identified in 3/89 HNSCC (3%). KRAS2 mutations were found in five out of 89 (6%) HNSCC examined. There were no mutations of KRAS2 and BRAF in non-neoplastic mucosa. We failed to observe a correlation between BRAF or KRAS2 mutations and histopathological factors. Our data indicate that BRAF gene mutations are relatively rare events in HNSCC. Although uncommon, BRAF mutations may identify a subset of patients with HNSCC sensitive to targeted therapy."

No downstream targets of LKB1 kinase activity have been identified. Here we show that LKB1 can direct the phosphorylation of the serine–threonine kinase PAR1A. The amino-acid residues phosphorylated as a result of LKB1 activity have been identified and phosphorylation at these residues is required for PAR1A kinase activity. PAR1A has previously been implicated as a positive regulator of the Wnt-βcatenin signalling pathway. We show here that LKB1 can modify transcription driven by the Wnt-regulated TCF response element, implicating LKB1 in a pathway known to play a key role in human colorectal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1990349961,"Transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes in association with DNA methylation contributes to malignant transformation. However, the specific DNA methyltransferases that initiate this process are unknown. Here we show that a de novo DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3b, substantially contributes to the oncogenic phenotype in a lung cancer model. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells expressing telomerase, SV40 large T antigen, and activated Ras were immortal, formed colonies in soft agar, and expressed DNMT3b. Antisense suppression of DNMT3b prevented soft agar growth. Furthermore, mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing T antigen and Ras formed soft agar colonies and large tumors, but fibroblasts from Dnmt3b(-/-) mice did not grow in soft agar and were much less tumorigenic in vivo. The tumor suppressor genes, FHIT, TSLC1, and RASSF1A were downregulated in transformed NHBE cells, and antisense DNMT3b treatment resulted in re-expression of FHIT and TSLC1. While expression of TSCL1 correlated with methylation of CpG dinucleotides in its promoter region, the expression of FHIT did not, suggesting that DNMT3b may silence genes by several mechanisms including direct DNA methylation or recruitment of proteins that modify chromatin. Regardless of mechanism, our data indicate that DNMT3b plays an important role in transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2095153382,"Axin is a multidomain protein that plays a critical role in Wnt signaling, serving as a scaffold for down-regulation of β-catenin. It also activates the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase by binding to MEKK1. However, it is intriguing that Axin requires several additional elements for JNK activation, including a requirement for homodimerization, sumoylation at the extreme C-terminal sites, and a region in the protein phosphatase 2A-binding domain. In our present study, we have shown that another MEKK family member, MEKK4, also binds to Axin in vivo and mediates Axin-induced JNK activation. Surprisingly MEKK4 binds to a region distinct from the MEKK1-binding site. Dominant negative mutant of MEKK4 attenuates the JNK activation by Axin. Activation of JNK by Axin in MEKK1–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells supports the idea that another MEKK can mediate Axin-induced JNK activation. Expression of specific small interfering RNA against MEKK4 effectively attenuates JNK activation by the MEKK1 binding-defective Axin mutant in 293T cells and inhibits JNK activation by wild-type Axin in MEKK1–/– cells, confirming that MEKK4 is indeed another mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase that is specifically involved in Axin-mediated JNK activation independently of MEKK1. We have also identified an additional domain between MEKK1- and MEKK4-binding sites as being required for JNK activation by Axin. MEKK1 and MEKK4 compete for Axin binding even though they bind to sites far apart, suggesting that Axin may selectively bind to MEKK1 or MEKK4 depending on distinct signals or cellular context.

More recently, Axin has also been shown to interact with low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) that acts as a co-receptor for Wnt (11Mao J. Wang J. Liu B. Pan W. Farr III, G.H. Flynn C. Yuan H. Takada S. Kimelman D. Li L. Wu D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), linking the upstream signaling components to downstream signaling transducers. The interaction of LRP5 with Axin in fact may provide a new mechanism for the Axin-based regulation of the intracellular levels of β-catenin, which is independent of the action of GSK-3β (12Tolwinski N.S. Wehrli M. Rives A. Erdeniz N. DiNardo S. Wieschaus E. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 407-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In this pathway, LRP recruits Axin to the membrane, leading to the degradation of Axin. As a consequence, β-catenin is no longer bound by Axin and is stabilized, resulting in elevated nuclear signaling by β-catenin. Clearly Axin is a multifunctional protein, and its functions are highly regulated. In addition to the Wnt pathway, Axin has also been shown to activate the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Other components in the Wnt pathway, Dishevelled and Diversin, also participate in the regulation of JNK activity (14Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 15Romond T.S. Asbrand C. Bakkers J. Kuhl M. Schaeffer H.J. Huelsken J. Behrens J. Hammerschmidt M. Birchmeier W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2073-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It was convincingly shown that a defect in the activation of JNK by Dishevelled, resulting from a point mutation in the DEP domain, leads to abnormality of planar polarity in Drosophila. Rescue analysis reveals different protein domain requirements in Dishevelled for the Wnt and JNK pathways; the C-terminal DEP domain is essential to rescue planar polarity defects and induce JNK signaling (14Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as with Axin, the Dishevelled/JNK pathway is discriminatory from the canonical Frz/Dvl Wnt pathway in that distinct domains are utilized in the two pathways (14Boutros M. Paricio N. Strutt D.I. Mlodzik M. Cell. 1998; 94: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol.

In addition, the slipper gene that encodes a mixed lineage kinase (MLK), a JNK kinase kinase or MAP3K (18Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 19Tzivion G. Shen Y.H. Zhu J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6331-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), is critical for dorsal closure in Drosophila (20Stronach B. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These findings all point to the significance of the JNK pathway in development in that it controls cell fate and cell sheet morphogenesis (21Lin A. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 22Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the JNK pathway, we previously showed that Axin interacts with MEKK1 and identified the MEKK1-binding domain as the MID domain flanked by the binding sites for APC on the N-terminal side and GSK-3β on the C-terminal side (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Several intriguing phenomena on the Axin-induced JNK activation prompted us to further define the exact domains required for Axin to activate JNK. First of all, we observed that, in addition to the MEKK1-binding domain, Axin required the entire region C-terminal to the β-catenin-binding site. Although we now know that the DIX domain is required for homodimerization of Axin (23Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that the extreme C-terminal six amino acids for sumoylation (24Rui H.L. Fan E. Zhou H.M. Xu Z. Zhang Y. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42981-42986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it remains unclear why the region in the PP2A-binding region is also required. Furthermore MEKK1 binding is highly regulated by conformational changes elicited by either GSK-3β binding or casein kinase I binding to Axin (5Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Chan S.C. Han J. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We reasoned that further deciphering the molecular mechanism whereby Axin activates the JNK pathway would yield invaluable insights into how the scaffold protein Axin mediates MAP3K and subsequently JNK activation. Among them, we shall be able to understand the structural and biochemical basis for the differential complex formations based on Axin. In the course of further delineating the binding region for MEKK1, we found that newly created deletion mutants of Axin, which could no longer bind to MEKK1, still fully effectively activated JNK. We wondered whether the previously created JNK activation-defective AxinΔMID happened to adopt a conformation that disallows Axin to activate JNK. To clarify this, we thoroughly examined all the critical Axin regions that could contribute to JNK activation. Through detailed analysis, we found that Axin also interacts with MEKK4 in addition to MEKK1. Surprisingly MEKK4 binds to a separate region inside the PP2A binding area far apart from the MEKK1-binding site. Dominant negative MEKK4-K/M mutant effectively attenuates JNK activation by wild-type Axin. Axin can activate JNK in mouse embryonic cells null for MEKK1 in accordance with the presence of MEKK4 in these cells. Furthermore small interfering RNA specific for MEKK4 inhibits JNK activation by Axin mutants that are defective in MEKK1 binding in 293T cells and by wild-type Axin in MEKK1–/– cells. The finding that two MAP3Ks can participate in the Axin/JNK pathway via competitive binding to two different sites adds a new level of complexity of the Axin-based differential complex formations. Our current data also suggest that Axin may receive distinct signals via MEKK1 or MEKK4 to activate JNK. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium as described previously (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic MEKK1–/– fibroblast cells, a gift from M. Karin (University of California, San Diego), were generated as described previously (25Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Construction of Expression Plasmids—Expression vectors for wild-type mouse HA-Axin, Myc-Axin, Axin M5, C2, HA-MEKK1, and FLAG-tagged JNK1 were generated as described previously (23Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25008-25014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Wild-type full-length human MEKK2 and mouse MEKK3 were generated from fragments by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-ccatggatgatcagcaagctttgaac-3′ and 5′-tctagactagtgataatgcacaaacatgtgc-3′ for MEKK2 and 5′-ccatggatgaacaagaggcattagac-3′ and 5′-tctagatcagtacactagctgtgcaaagtg-3′ for MEKK3. The cDNA sequence for MEKK4-C starts from the BamHI site to the 3′-end derived from Clone KIAA0213 (courtesy of Kazusa DNA Research Institute) encoding aa 755–1605. All PCR products were verified by sequencing. MEKK2, MEKK3, and MEKK4 were fused in-frame with HA and Myc tag and cloned into the ClaI and XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pCMV5. Axin deletion mutants D4, D19, DR2, D20, M4, M6, M8, M9, M10, and M11 were created by subcloning PCR-generated fragments that contained convenient restriction sites followed by fusing the respective deletion mutant fragments with their appropriate flanking wild-type cDNA. Axin deletion mutant D19/M8 was created by fusing the ClaI-XbaI fragment of Axin D19 with the XbaI-BamHI fragment of Axin M8 followed by cloning into the ClaI and BamHI sites of pCMV5. Detailed information is available upon request. Transient Transfection and Immunokinase Assays—Transfections were performed in 60-mm dishes using Dosper Liposomal Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total amount of transfected DNA of each plate was adjusted with the empty vector pCMV5 where necessary. Cells were harvested at 40 h posttransfection and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). FLAG-tagged JNK1 was immunoprecipitated using mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma); the JNK activity was determined as described previously using 1 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) (Stratagene) as substrate (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) followed by Western blotting using phospho-c-Jun antibody (Cell Signaling Inc.) to examine the phosphorylation of c-Jun. -Fold activation of the kinase was determined by an imaging analyzer (Amersham Biosciences, Model 425E) and normalized to the total amount of the JNK protein. Data are expressed as -fold kinase activation compared with that in vector-transfected cells with the values representing the mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transiently transfected 293T or MEKK1–/– embryonic fibroblast cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed in the same lysis buffer as described above, sonicated 10 times for 1 s each, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. HA- or Myc-tagged Axin proteins or MEKK proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-HA (Roche Applied Science), anti-Myc (9E10), or anti-MEKK1 (C-22) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies and Protein A/G Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against endogenous Axin was a generous gift of Dr. David M. Virshup (University of Utah); anti-MEKK4 was purchased from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The boiled samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics). After blocking with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the membranes were probed with either anti-Myc (9E10), anti-MEKK1 (C-22), anti-HA, or anti-FLAG antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. RNA Interference—The pSUPER vector was used to knock down the expression of MEKK4 in 293T cells and in MEKK1–/– cells. A human MEKK4-specific 19-mer nucleotide, 5′-tgttatgcacgttggcttg-3′, was inserted into pSUPER vector according to the instructions (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). To test for the efficiency of pSUPER-MEKK4, cells were co-transfected with 1 or 5 μg of pSUPER-MEKK4 and 1 μg of Myc-MEKK4-C plus 1 μg of FLAG-JNK1 in each transfection as a control for transfection efficiency. After 40 h of additional culture, cells were lysed, and the expression of MEKK4-C was analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc. To examine JNK activation by Axin deletion mutant D19 in pSUPER-MEKK4-treated 293T cells and that by wild-type Axin in MEKK1–/– cells, cells were transfected with 5 μg of pSUPER-MEKK4 and 1 μg of HA-tagged Axin D19 or wild-type Axin together with 1 μg of FLAG-JNK1. Immunokinase assays were performed as described above. Axin Mutants Lacking the MEKK1-binding Site Retain the Ability to Activate JNK—It was previously shown that MEKK1, but not TAK or ASK, functionally interacted with Axin on a domain termed MID (aa 210–352) (13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have also shown that GSK-3β or casein kinase Iα and Iϵ binding to Axin excludes MEKK1 binding (16Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting that JNK activation by Axin is at least in part regulated by conformational changes of the Axin protein. As part of efforts to address the structural basis underlying JNK activation by Axin, we fine mapped the region required for MEKK1 binding (Fig. 1, lower left panel). Deletion mutant D4 had aa 210–243 removed and was intact in MEKK1 binding. DR2 mutant lacked aa 330–352 and was also capable of binding to MEKK1, indicating that the region between aa 244 and 329 is responsible for MEKK1 binding. Surprisingly, when the newly created MID domain mutants were assayed for their ability to activate JNK, we found that these MEKK1 binding-defective mutants (i.e. D19 and D20) activated JNK fully (Fig. 1, lower right panel). MEKK4 Interacts with Axin via a Novel Domain Distinct from the MEKK1-binding Site—As MEKK2, -3, and -4 are structurally related to MEKK1, we first tested whether they also interacted with Axin, which might account for the JNK-activating function of the Axin mutants defective in MEKK1 binding. Myc-tagged Axin was co-transfected with HA-tagged MEKK1-C, -2, -3, or -4-C. Immunoprecipitation was carried out reciprocally with anti-Myc and anti-HA; the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA for MEKKs and anti-Myc for Axin. As shown previously, the C-terminal fragment of MEKK1 containing the kinase domain bound to wild-type Axin (Fig. 2A, Ref. 13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Interestingly MEKK4-C also strongly interacted with Axin, whereas MEKK2 or MEKK3 was not co-immunoprecipitated with Axin (Fig. 2A). To map the region of Axin for MEKK4 binding, a series of Axin deletion mutants were created, including the ones indicated on Fig. 2B, top. We separately co-transfected different HA-tagged Axin mutants with Myc-MEKK4-C and performed co-immunoprecipitation. Results revealed that a domain, distinct from the MEKK1-binding region, binds to MEKK4, which is located around aa 679–746 as deduced from MEKK4 binding assays with constructs M6 and C2 (Fig. 2B). Further deletion of aa 507–672 (M6) or removal of the C-terminal aa 747–832 (C2) did not affect the ability of Axin to bind MEKK4, whereas further removal of aa 673–705 (M5) rendered Axin incapable to bind MEKK4. Consistently deletion of the 33 aa from 679 to 711 (M8) abolished Axin binding to MEKK4. This MEKK4-binding site is inside the region previously known also to interact with PP2A (10Hsu W. Zeng L. Costantini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3439-3445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the two regions for MEKK1 and MEKK4 binding are far apart. To verify the Axin-MEKK4 interaction, we tested whether the interaction occurred in their physiologic concentrations. We lysed untransfected 293T cells and pulled down endogenous Axin, MEKK1, or MEKK4 by using anti-Axin, anti-MEKK1, or anti-MEKK4 polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Axin was detected in the anti-MEKK1 and anti-MEKK4 immunoprecipitates; MEKK1 and MEKK4 were both detected in the anti-Axin immunoprecipitated complexes. Interestingly MEKK1 was not detected in the immunocomplexes pulled down by the anti-MEKK4 antibody. Similarly MEKK4 was not present in the anti-MEKK1 immunocomplexes (Fig. 3, left panel). The mutually exclusive presence of MEKK1 and MEKK4 in the Axin complexes is consistent with our finding that they compete against each other in binding to Axin (see below). In parallel, we also performed single transfection experiments to test Axin site dependence for MEKK binding. Axin deletion mutants that lack the binding site of either MEKK1 (D19) or MEKK4 (M8) were transfected into 293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Axin, MEKK1, or MEKK4. Immunoblotting analysis of the immunoprecipitates showed that Axin D19 could no longer interact with the endogenous MEKK1 and that Axin M8 could not interact with the endogenous MEKK4. Dominant Negative MEKK4 Diminished Axin-mediated JNK Activation—To test whether MEKK4 could indeed mediate the Axin-induced JNK activation, we substituted the conserved lysine (K) residue in MEKKs with methionine (M) to create their respective dominant negative forms, MEKK-K/Ms. As expected, Axin alone activated JNK to greater than 10-fold. In contrast, when Axin was co-transfected with MEKK4C-K/M, the JNK activation was drastically diminished as in the cells co-transfected with MEKK1C-K/M. In contrast, MEKK2-K/M or MEKK3-K/M failed to attenuate the Axin-induced JNK activation (Fig. 4). These observations are in accordance with their binding activity toward Axin. MEKK1 and MEKK4 Require a Common Region of Axin in Addition to Their Respective Binding Sites for JNK Activation—During the course of fine deletion mapping for both MEKK1 and MEKK4 interaction regions in Axin, we found another region of Axin that is required by both MEKK1 and MEKK4 for JNK activation (Fig. 5). M6 (Δaa 507–672) could bind to both MEKK1 and MEKK4 but failed to activate JNK (Fig. 5), indicating that the region of aa 507–672 is required by both MEKK1 and MEKK4 for JNK activation. The requirement for this novel domain is further supported by observations that other mutants such as M4 (Δaa 507–730), in which part of the region of aa 507–672 is deleted, could bind to MEKK1 as strongly as did the wild-type Axin but failed to activate JNK (Fig. 2 and data not shown). In contrast, M8 (Δaa 679–711) that retains the region of aa 507–672 activated JNK well. To further define this important region of Axin for JNK activation, we generated another three deletions, M9, M10, and M11, in the region of aa 610–720 as schematically diagrammed in Fig. 4. JNK assay and MEKK4 binding experiment were carried out with these mutants. The results showed that the region encompassing aa 642–673 N-terminal to the MEKK4-binding site is indispensable for Axin to activate JNK (Fig. 5), suggesting that MEKK1 and MEKK4 independently require this novel domain for JNK activation. As the Axin regions of aa 210–338 and aa 679–711 are required for MEKK1 and MEKK4 binding respectively, we constructed an Axin deletion mutant, D19/M8, that removes both of the two MEKK-binding sites and tested whether it could activate JNK. The result in Fig. 5 (right panel) shows that AxinD19/M8 cannot activate JNK. MEKK4 Competes against MEKK1 for Binding to Axin, and Its Binding in Axin but Not Its Kinase Activity Is Required for This Competition—We previously showed that Axin forms different complexes in regulating the Wnt pathway and JNK pathways. GSK-3β and casein kinase Iϵ binding abolished MEKK1 binding to Axin (5Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Chan S.C. Han J. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Zhang Y. Qiu W.J. Liu D.X. Neo S.Y. He X. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32152-32159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether MEKK1 and MEKK4 could mutually affect their binding to Axin. As dimerization-defective Axin is fully capable of binding to both MEKK1 and MEKK4 (Ref. 13Zhang Y. Neo S.Y. Wang X. Han J. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35247-35254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and Fig. 2B), we used HA-Axin C2 that lacks the DIX domain to test whether MEKK1 and -4 compete for binding to the same monomeric Axin molecules. The 293T cells were co-transfected with 1 μg each of Axin C2 and MEKK1 together with increasing amounts of MEKK4-C (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 μg). Results showed that in the presence of increasing amounts of MEKK4, MEKK1 binding to Axin was diminished and was completely abolished when co-transfected with 2.0 μg of MEKK4-C (Fig. 6A). Similarly MEKK1 competed against MEKK4 binding to Axin, although MEKK4 seemed to have higher affinity than MEKK1 as co-transfection of 2.0 μg of MEKK1 could not as effectively diminish MEKK4 binding as did MEKK4 to MEKK1 (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that MEKK1 and MEKK4 binding may change the conformation of Axin so that MEKK1 and MEKK4 cannot co-exist in the complex. We then tested whether the kinase activity of MEKK4 is required for its competition against MEKK1 in Axin binding. We co-transfected increasing amounts of the kinase-inactive form of MEKK4, MEKK4-K/M, with 1 μg each of Axin C2 and MEKK1. Results showed that MEKK1 binding to Axin was gradually decreased in the presence of increasing amounts of MEKK4-K/M (Fig. 6C). However, MEKK4 requires its binding domain in Axin to compete against MEKK1 binding as it could not attenuate MEKK1 binding to Axin M8 that lacks the MEKK4-binding site (Fig. 6D). Axin Activates JNK in the MEKK1 – / – Embryonic Fibroblast Cells—With the advent of MEKK4 as a new Axin-binding protein, we wished to test whether Axin could activate JNK in the embryonic fibroblast cells null for MEKK1, which were generated by gene targeting (25Xia Y. Makris C. Su B. Li E. Yang J. Nemerow G.R. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5243-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). MEKK4 was detected in the MEKK1–/– cells, and as expected, MEKK1 was not expressed in the cells (Fig. 7B). Axin and FLAG-JNK1 were transfected into the MEKK1–/– cells and into 293T cells as a comparison. As shown in Fig. 7A, Axin activated JNK in the MEKK1–/– cells to a level comparable to that in 293T cells. This finding is particularly significant in that MEKK1 and MEKK4 in fact compete for binding to Axin. Small Interfering RNA of MEKK4 Attenuates JNK Activation by MEKK1 Binding-defective Axin Mutant—As shown above, when the MEKK1-binding domain of Axin is removed (D19 and D20, Fig. 1), the Axin mutant could utilize MEKK4 to activate JNK. We reasoned that, in the absence of MEKK1, a decrease of the endogenous MEKK4 should result in reduced JNK activation by Axin. In particular, it would indicate whether MAP3Ks other than MEKK1 and MEKK4 could also play a role in the Axin-mediated JNK activation. The small interfering RNA technique has been utilized to successfully knock down a variety of genes in mammalian cells (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Aga"
https://openalex.org/W1998841669,"Nuclear receptors have been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of expression of a growing number of genes, including cytochromes P450 and 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Although drugs that induce cytochromes P450 also induce ALAS1, the regulatory mechanisms governing these pathways have not been fully elucidated. We have identified a drug-responsive enhancer in the murine ALAS1 gene. This sequence mediates transcriptional activation by a wide range of compounds including typical cytochrome P450 pan-inducers phenobarbital and metyrapone, as well as specific activators of the pregnane X receptor and the constitutive androstane receptor. ALAS1 drug-responsive enhancer sequences were identified by transient transfection of reporter gene constructs in the drug-responsive leghorn male hepatoma cell line. Using the NUBIScan algorithm, DR4 nuclear receptor binding sites were identified within the elements and their roles in mediating transcriptional activation of ALAS1 were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate clear interactions of mouse pregnane X receptor and constitutive androstane receptor on the ADRES. Transactivation assays in CV-1 cells implicate the nuclear receptors as major contributors to transcriptional activation of ALAS1. Moreover, in vivo studies in knock-out animals confirm the induction of ALAS1 is mediated at least in part by nuclear receptors. These studies are the first to explain drug induction via drug response elements for mammalian ALAS1."
https://openalex.org/W1967831691,"Basic studies of oncogenesis have demonstrated that either the elevated production of particular oncogene proteins or the occurrence of qualitative abnormalities in oncogenes can contribute to neoplastic cellular transformation. The purpose of this study was to identify unique oncogenes that are differentially expressed in human cancers and characterize their functions in tumorigenesis. To discover new putative oncogenes, the differential display RT–PCR method was applied using normal cervical tissues, cervical cancer cell lines, cervical cancer tissues, and metastatic tissues. We identified a new human cervical cancer oncogene HCCR-2 that was overexpressed in various human tumors including leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinomas of the breast, kidney, ovary, stomach, colon, and uterine cervix. Ectopic expression of HCCR-2 resulted in direct tumorigenic conversions of NIH/3T3 and Rat1 fibroblasts. Nude mice injected with NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with HCCR-2 formed tumors in 4 weeks. The resultant tumors display characteristics of an epithelial carcinoma. In HCCR-2 transfected NCI-H460 cells and RKO cells, stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor occurred without genetic mutation and correlated with functional impairment, as indicated by the defective induction of p53-induced p21WAF1, MDM2, and bax. These results indicate that HCCR-2 probably represents a new oncogene that is related to tumorigenesis, functioning as a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W2081698356,"The three-dimensional structure of nawaprin has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This 51-amino acid residue peptide was isolated from the venom of the spitting cobra, Naja nigricollis, and is the first member of a new family of snake venom proteins referred to as waprins. Nawaprin is relatively flat and disc-like in shape, characterized by a spiral backbone configuration that forms outer and inner circular segments. The two circular segments are held together by four disulfide bonds, three of which are clustered at the base of the molecule. The inner segment contains a short antiparallel β-sheet, whereas the outer segment is devoid of secondary structures except for a small turn or 310 helix. The structure of nawaprin is very similar to elafin, a human leukocyte elastase-specific inhibitor. Although substantial parts of the nawaprin molecule are well defined, the tips of the outer and inner circular segments, which are hypothesized to be critical for binding interactions, are apparently disordered, similar to that found in elafin. The amino acid residues in these important regions in nawaprin are different from those in elafin, suggesting that nawaprin is not an elastase-specific inhibitor and therefore has a different function in the snake venom.

The amino acid residues in these important regions in nawaprin are different from those in elafin, suggesting that nawaprin is not an elastase-specific inhibitor and therefore has a different function in the snake venom. Snake venoms are rich sources of pharmacologically active polypeptides and proteins. Some of these proteins exhibit enzymatic activities. These enzymes include phospholipase A2, proteinase, nucleotidase, phosphodiesterase, and l-amino acid oxidase. In addition to their catalytic properties that may contribute to the digestive action of the venom, these enzymes also induce various pharmacological effects including neurotoxic, myotoxic, cardiotoxic, hemorrhagic, hemolytic, procoagulant, and anticoagulant effects (1Bailey G.S. Enzymes from Snake Venom. Alaken, Fort Collins, CO1998Google Scholar, 2Kini R.M. Venom Phospholipase A2 Enzymes: Structure, Function and Mechanism. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1997Google Scholar). Several other snake venom proteins and polypeptides do not exhibit these and other enzymatic activities and thus are described as “nonenzymatic proteins.” These proteins include neurotoxins, cardiotoxins, myotoxins, ion channel inhibitors, and anticoagulant proteins (3Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991Google Scholar, 4Tu A.T. Reptile Venoms and Toxins. Marcel Decker, New York1991Google Scholar). Thus, snake venom proteins, whether they are enzymatic or nonenzymatic, have evolved as a complex mixture of proteins that target several tissues, organs, and physiological systems and interfere in their normal functions. Therefore snake venoms, when injected into a prey or victim, result in the simultaneous assault on various tissues, leading to multiple organ or system failure and often death. A large number of protein toxins have been purified and characterized from snake venoms. These studies have shown that each venom contains over a hundred protein toxins. These toxins, however, belong to a very small number of superfamilies of proteins. For example, a single snake venom can contain as many as 15 isoforms of phospholipase A2 (5Braganca B.M. Sambray Y.M. Nature. 1967; 216: 1210-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Takasaki C. Suzuki J. Tamiya N. Toxicon. 1990; 28: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Ogawa T.

As one would expect, they share remarkable similarities in their primary, secondary, and tertiary structures. However, at times they differ from each other in their biological targeting and hence their pharmacological effects. Similarly, other enzymes as well as nonenzymatic proteins in snake venoms also exist in many isoforms (8Mebs D. Claus I. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 425-447Google Scholar) and can be classified in protein families. So far more than 1000 nonenzymatic proteins have been characterized, and these protein toxins are grouped into well recognized families as follows: 1) three-finger toxins (including neurotoxins and cardiotoxins), 2) serine proteinase inhibitors (including proteinase inhibitors and dendrotoxins), 3) lectins, 4) sarafatoxins, 5) nerve growth factors, 6) atrial natriuretic peptides, 7) bradykinin-potentiating peptides, 8) disintegrins, and 9) helveprins/CRISP (8Mebs D.

The members in each family of protein toxins have a similar molecular scaffold, but they exhibit multiple functions. Thus, it appears that during the evolution of venoms some of the molecular scaffolds have been “selected,” and various “functional sites” were generated by accelerated evolution to a common molecular scaffold. We are interested in the structure-function relationships of various families of toxins from snake and other venoms. Many of the early efforts in venom research were directed toward the isolation and characterization of either proteins that are found in abundance or the most toxic components. With the advent of more sophisticated purification techniques, there have been studies of new and interesting protein components that are found in smaller quantities. In this paper, we describe a novel toxin that is a member of a new family of snake venom toxins. Thus, we have isolated and purified nawaprin, the first member of this family, from Naja nigricollis venom. The complete amino acid sequence and the solution structure of this toxin have been determined. Nawaprin is structurally similar to secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) 1The abbreviations used are: SLPI, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor; ACN, acetonitrile; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; WAP, whey acidic protein; NOESY, nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: SLPI, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor; ACN, acetonitrile; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; WAP, whey acidic protein; NOESY, nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy. and elafin, the tertiary structures of which have been studied by NMR (12Francart C. Dauchez M. Alix A.J. Lippens G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallography (13Tsunemi M. Matsuura Y. Sakakibara S. Katsube Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11570-11576Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both nawaprin and elafin contain four disulfide bonds and several proline residues. Elafin is a specific inhibitor of human leukocyte elastase and porcine pancreatic elastase, the former of which was first obtained from exfoliated skin (scales) of patients with psoriasis (14Schalkwijk J. Chang A. Janssen P. De Jongh G.J. Mier P.D. Brit. J. Dermatol. 1990; 122: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Wiedow O. Schroder J.M. Gregory H. Young J.A. Christophers E. J. Biol.

This new protein fold has also been used as a scaffold in the evolution of snake venom toxins and may be useful in the engineering of proteins with novel pharmacological actions. Materials—Lyophilized crude N. nigricollis venom was obtained from Miami Serpentarium Laboratories (Miami, FL). Trypsin endopeptidase was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). 4-Vinylpyridine was obtained from Sigma. Superdex 30 and Sephasil C18 columns were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Isolation and Purification of Nawaprin from N. nigricollis Snake Venom—Nawaprin was purified by a three-step purification process protocol; gel filtration of venom on a Superdex 30 column was followed by ion exchange chromatography on a UNO S6 column and HPLC on a Jupiter C18 column. Crude venom (200 mg) was loaded onto a Superdex 30 column (HiLoad™ 16/60) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The proteins were eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein elution was monitored at 280 nm. The fraction with the peak of interest (∼2–5 mg) was applied separately onto a UNO S6 cation exchange column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (Buffer A). The bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 1 m NaCl in Buffer A. Protein elution was carried out at a flow rate of 2 ml/min and monitored at 280 nm. The unbound fraction from the UNO S6 column was loaded onto a Jupiter C18, 10μ (10 mm/250 mm) column equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid on a Vision Work station (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The bound proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 80% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The elution of proteins was monitored at 215 nm. Reduction and Pyridylethylation—Purified protein was reduced and pyridylethylated using procedures described earlier (16Joseph J.S. Chung M.C.M. Jeyaseelan K. Kini R.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 621-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein (0.5 mg) was dissolved in 500 μl of denaturant buffer 6 m guanidium hydrochloride, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5. After the addition of 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol, the mixture was incubated under vacuum for 2 h at 37 °C. 4-Vinylpyridine (50 μl) was added to the mixture and kept at room temperature for 2 h. Pyridylethylated protein was purified on a μ-RPC C2/C18 (2.1 mm/10 mm) column using ACN in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Chemical and Enzymatic Cleavage—Peptides of pyridylethylated protein were obtained by chemical cleavage using formic acid (Asp-specific) as described by Inglis (17Inglis A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Briefly, the desalted protein sample (500 μg) was dissolved in 2% formic acid in a glass vial and then frozen. Subsequently, under vacuum, the vial was thawed at room temperature and then sealed off. The vial was then heated at 108 °C for 2 h and allowed to cool to room temperature. Peptide digestion of the pyridylethylated protein was also obtained by enzymatic cleavage with trypsin. Pyridylethylated protein (300 μg) was dissolved in 300 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer and digested overnight by trypsin at 37 °C. The peptides generated by both formic acid and tryptic digestion were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Sephasil C18 (5μ, 2.1 mm/10 mm) column, equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. A linear gradient of 80% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) was used to elute bound peptides. Mass Spectrometry—The protein fractions eluted from the columns were screened for novel molecular weight peptides using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Voyager DE-STR Biospectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Typically, 1–5 pmol/μl of the sample was co-crystallized with an equal volume of the matrix (10 mg/ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid freshly prepared in 1:1 ACN:water containing 0.3% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) on a 100-well stainless steel sample plate. The accelerating voltage was set at 25,000 V, the grid voltage was set at 93.0%, and the guide wire voltage was set at 0.3%. Molecular ions were generated using a nitrogen laser (wavelength, 337 nm) at an intensity of 1800–2200. Extraction of ions was delayed by 800 ns. The spectrum was obtained by averaging several scans. The spectrum was calibrated using external molecular weight standards. Precise masses (0.01%) of the native protein and peptides were determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) using a PerkinElmer Sciex API 300 LC/MS/MS system. Typically, reverse phase HPLC fractions were directly used for analysis; alternatively, samples were prepared by dissolving desalted, lyophilized samples in 1:1:1 ACN:methanol:water (v/v/v) containing 1% acetic acid. The samples were delivered either by direct infusion or flow injection. Ion spray, orifice, and ring voltages were set at 4600, 50, and 350 V, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizer and curtain gas. An LC-10AD Shimadzu liquid chromatograph was used for solvent delivery (40% (v/v) ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The software Biomultiview (PerkinElmer Sciex) was used to analyze and deconvolute the raw mass spectrum. Amino-terminal Sequencing—Amino-terminal sequencing of the native and pyridylethylated protein as well as peptides was performed by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 494 pulsed-liquid phase protein sequencer (Procise) with an on-line 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR sample was prepared by dissolving 3.1 mg of the lyophilized peptide in 0.350 ml of 90% H2O, 10% D2O in a 5-mm Shigemi (Allison Park, PA) NMR tube, resulting in a final protein concentration of 1.7 mm and pH 3.1. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) AVANCE-600 DRX spectrometer using a 5-mm 1H inverse probe operating at temperatures of 10, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were acquired in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase detection (18Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar). Homonuclear two-dimensional spectra recorded were double-quantum filtered COSY (19Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar) with a fast recycle time (20Derome A.E. Williamson M.P. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar), total correlation spectroscopy (21Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a spin-lock period of 60 ms, and NOESY (22Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 200 ms. Solvent signal suppression was achieved either by presaturation or by using the WATERGATE (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3508) Google Scholar) pulse sequence. H-D exchange experiments were carried out by reconstituting the freeze-dried sample with D2O, acquiring series of one-dimensional spectra for 15 min, and then acquiring two 1-h total correlation spectroscopy spectra. All of the spectra were processed using XWIN-NMR software (Bruker) and analyzed using the program XEASY (24Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Structural Calculations—The final structure was obtained by using restraints consisting of 503 nonredundant NOE-derived distances, 18 hydrogen bonds, 9 ϕ dihedral angles, and 4 disulfide bonds (see Table II). The NOESY spectrum recorded at 25 °C with a mixing time of 200 ms provided the NOE constraints. The H-D exchange experiments and the preliminary calculated structures were used in deducing hydrogen-bonding pairs. The hydrogen-bonding constraints were assigned upper distance limits of 2.2 Å for NH i to O j and 3.2 Å for N i to O j. The disulfide bond configuration was determined from the characteristic NOE interactions between the α and β protons of two-paired cysteine residues.Table IIStructural statistics for the ensemble of 20 nawaprin structuresQuantityValueDistance restraintsIntraresidue (i— j = 0)206Sequential (|i— j| = 1)143Medium range (|i— j| ≤ 5)24Long range (|i— j| > 5)130Hydrogen bonds18Total521Dihedral angle restraintsφ9Atomic root mean square deviation with the mean structure (Å)Backbone atoms (1-51)1.81 ± 0.58Heavy atoms (1-51)2.23 ± 0.48Backbone atoms (2-8, 22-38, and 44-51)0.32 ± 0.07Heavy atoms (2-8, 22-38, and 44-51)0.68 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab The standard simulated annealing procedure in DYANA was employed to obtain preliminary structures prior to refinement. An iterative cycle of calculations, structure analysis, manual assignment, and constraint revision was implemented to improve the quality of calculated structures. The final DYANA calculation yielded 3000 structures, 60 of which (with the lowest NOE violations) were selected for refinement by using the standard simulated annealing script in CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The 20 structures with the lowest overall energy were considered as representative of nawaprin. Secondary structures in nawaprin were determined using MOLMOL (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6477) Google Scholar). Purification of a Novel Protein from N. nigricollis Venom— Gel filtration of the crude venom of N. nigricollis on a Superdex 30 column yielded eight major peaks (Fig. 1A). Because our interest lay in isolating small novel peptides (4000–9000 Da), we searched for polypeptides that had masses that were distinctly different from the well established toxin families, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). Peak 4 had a mass of ∼5290 Da. The molecular size was less than three-finger toxins and serine proteinase inhibitors but larger than atrial natriuretic peptides (8Mebs D. Claus I. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 425-447Google Scholar). Thus, based on its mass, we had identified a polypeptide belonging to no other known family of snake venom proteins. Proteins in peak 4 were further separated on a cation exchange column, UNO S6 (Fig. 1B). The protein of interest did not bind to the column; it was eluted in the unbound fraction. The protein was further purified on a reverse phase column, Jupiter C18 (Fig. 1C). The major peak in the HPLC chromatogram had a molecular weight of 5288.50 ± 0.08 by ESI-MS (Fig. 1D). The overall yield of the protein varied from batch to batch of venom samples between 0.09 and 0.51% (n = 8). Determination of the Amino Acid Sequence—Amino-terminal sequencing of the native protein was achieved by the Edman degradation, and it resulted in the identification of first 34 residues (Fig. 2A). To complete the sequence, the pyridylethylated protein and the two peptides F1 and F2 purified from the formic acid digest were analyzed (data not shown). All of the 51 residues, except the 48th residue, were unequivocally identified. To confirm the sequence, the pyridylethylated protein was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were then purified (data not shown). The carboxyl-terminal peptide was identified, based on its mass and sequence. Then we could identify the 48th residue as Thr. Hence, this novel protein contains 51 residues, including eight cysteine residues (Fig. 2A). The calculated molecular weights of the native and pyridylethylated proteins were 5288.12 (with the assumption that all eight cysteine residues are involved in disulfide bond formation) and 6137.37, respectively; these values matched the estimated masses determined by ESI-MS (Table I). BLAST search for sequence homology indicated that this protein belongs to the family of whey acidic proteins (WAP) (Fig. 2B). Since then, we have isolated and purified two other peptides from snake venoms that show similar mass and amino acid sequence. Although all of the cysteine residues are conserved in these proteins, the intercysteine segments are distinctly different. 2B. G. Fry, S. T. Hock, and R. M. Kini, unpublished observations. Because of their homology with WAPs, we have named this new family of snake venom proteins Waprins (WAP-related proteins) and named the protein from N. nigricollis venom Nawaprin ( Naja waprin).Table ITheoretical and experimentally determined masses of nawaprin and its peptidesMolecular massCalculatedaMasses were calculated from the amino acid sequences.ObservedbMasses were determined by ESI-MS or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Native nawaprin5288.215288.5 ± 0.08Pyridyethylated nawaprin6137.376737.5 ± 0.2Formic acid peptide F1 (28-51)3001.663002.5 ± 0.8Formic acid peptide F2 (10-51)5114.285113.5 ± 1.1Tryptic peptide T3 (39-51)1537.841535.5 ± 0.8a Masses were calculated from the amino acid sequences.b Masses were determined by ESI-MS or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Waprins are structurally closer to the epididymal secretory protein members of the WAP family (Fig. 2B). These proteins are specifically expressed in the vas deferens and the distal epididymis (30Kirchhoff C. Oster-hoff C. Habben I. Well R. Int. J. Androl. 1990; 13: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Trappins (transglutaminase substrate and WAP domain-containing proteins) of the WAP family are “trapped” in the tissues through covalent crosslinking (31Zeeuwen P.I.J.M. Hendriks W. de Jong W.W.

Suzuki Y. Ghoneim M.A. Tachibana S. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)) with a variable number of hexapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence GQDPVK. Trappins anchor the biologically active WAP motifs at appropriate sites in the extracellular matrix through this domain. Elafin/SKALP (skin-derived anti-leukoproteinase), SPAI-2 (Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor), and porcine WAP-3 are some of the members of the trappin family, although elafin and SPAI were first isolated as soluble proteins (14Schalkwijk J.

Commun. 1989; 164: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, some of the WAP proteins such as SLPI and human seminal plasma inhibitor do not have the cementoin domain and are produced as secreted proteins (37Stetler G. Brewer M.T. Thompson R.C.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 79-82PubMed Google Scholar). WAPs and other family members have one to three similar domains, whereas waprins contain a single four-disulfide core domain and are found in snake venoms in soluble form. Determination of Solution Structure—The NOESY spectrum of nawaprin obtained at 25 °C and pH 3.1 showed wide dispersion of amide proton signals indicating β-sheet secondary structures (Fig. 3). The analysis of the spectra was, however, not straightforward because it was made difficult by a number complicating factors: These included the presence of seven proline residues, excessive line broadening for a number of peaks, and an extra set of small peaks suggesting the presence of minor conformations of the peptide in solution. The seven proline residues in nawaprin presented a major difficulty in resonance assignment because it led to peak overlap in appropriate regions of the spectra. All proline residues displayed strong d αδ(i–1,i) connectivities, suggesting that they were mainly in the trans-conformation (40Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 117-161Google Scholar), but still the existence of minor cis-conformations could not be completely discounted. For example, Pro31 showed an additional d αα(i–1,i) cross-peak, although its intensity is very weak. This could explain the presence of minor sets of peaks in the spectra that could not be readily assigned to a specific residue in the sequence. The presence of minor conformation(s) in solution was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC of the repurified sample wherein two minor peaks, whose intensities were ∼5% of the large (major) peak, were detected. In addition to these unwanted factors, broad peaks were also observed for many backbone amide protons that may suggest intermediate chemical exchange of protons with the aqueous solvent, slow conformational averaging, or flexibility in the molecule. Moreover, the backbone amide peaks of Lys21, Leu23, Cys41, Met44, and Thr45 were split, suggesting a slow-to-medium state of conformational exchange. In the final analysis, the difficulties encountered in the resonance assignments were resolved by performing several homonuclear two-dimensional experiments at different temperatures and pH. The 34% sequence similarity between elafin and nawaprin, and the eight conserved cysteine residues, suggest equivalent cysteine pairing patterns (Fig. 2C). This was confirmed by NMR based on the characteristic NOEs between α and β protons of the bonded cysteine pairs. NOE connectivities that were observed included Cys30-Hα-Cys46-Hβ, Cys30-Hβ-Cys46-Hα, Cys30-Hβ-Cys46-Hβ, Cys7-Hβ-Cys37-Hα, Cys7-Hβ-Cys37-Hβ, and Cys24-Hα-Cys36-Hβ. The NOE cross-peaks linking Cys20–Cys41 were not observed, probably because of rather broad lines in the corresponding part of the spectrum. However, this pairing was easily established by elimination (because the three disulfide pairings were then known) and later during preliminary structure calculations, because considerable long range NOE connectivities were also observed among the protons of their neighboring residues (Cys41, Phe43, Thr22, and Lys21). Structure Description—The structure of nawaprin in solution was characterized by the presence of both well and poorly defined regions, the extents of which were comparable in magnitude. Fig. 4A shows the ensemble of the best 20 structures superimposed over the backbone atoms of the “well defined” residues, 2–8, 22–38, and 44–51 of the mean structure. It is clear that although large sections of the nawaprin molecule were well ordered, some regions were apparently disordered. The mean global backbone root mean square deviation with respect to the mean structure was 1.81 Å when all of the residues were superimposed; this was reduced to 0.32 Å when only the well defined residues of 2–8, 22–38, and 44–51 were considered (Table II). Although the amino and carboxyl termini of nawaprin were relatively well defined, there was substantial disorder in the upper regions defined by residues 9–21, called the “outer loop,” and 39–43, called the “inner loop”; this suggests that these two regions of the molecule have higher flexibility"
https://openalex.org/W2009516725,"Transcription factor C/EBPalpha induces normal myeloid differentiation, inactivation of C/EBPalpha leads to a differentiation block in acute myeloid leukemias (AML), and overexpression of C/EBPalpha results in AML growth arrest and differentiation. Recent reports suggest that C/EBPalpha is activated or inactivated via protein-protein interactions. We previously reported that C/EBPalpha needs to inactivate the proto-oncogene c-Jun via leucine zipper domain interaction in order to induce granulocytic differentiation. We, therefore, hypothesized that c-Jun expression might be elevated in AML and subsequently inactivate C/EBPalpha. In fact, compared to normal bone marrow mononuclear cells, c-Jun expression is increased in AML patient samples (Affymetrix expression microarray analysis, n=166). c-Jun binds to C/EBPalpha via the leucine zipper domains and prevents C/EBPalpha from DNA binding. Inactivation of C/EBPalpha by c-Jun is necessary for c-Jun to induce proliferation because c-Jun-induced proliferation can be prevented by ectopic overexpression of C/EBPalpha. The dominant-negative 30-kDa C/EBPalpha protein, found in AML, fails to downregulate c-Jun mRNA expression in AML patient samples. Thus, our data suggest a model for AML in which c-Jun promotes proliferation and prevents differentiation by inhibiting C/EBPalpha DNA binding via leucine zipper domain interaction. It might depend on the expression levels of C/EBPalpha and c-Jun, if inhibition of C/EBPalpha by c-Jun or if inhibition of c-Jun by C/EBPalpha is more predominant: proliferation versus differentiation; AML versus normal myeloid development."
https://openalex.org/W2055046750,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is the main cause of nosocomial and community-onset infections that affect millions of people worldwide. Some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections have become essentially untreatable by β-lactams because of acquired molecular machineries enabling antibiotic resistance. Evasion from methicillin challenge is mainly achieved by the synthesis of a penicillin-binding protein of low affinity for antibiotics, MecA, that replaces regular penicillin-binding proteins in cell wall turnover when these have been inactivated by antibiotics. MecA synthesis is regulated by a signal transduction system consisting of the sensor/transducer MecR1 and the 14-kDa transcriptional repressor MecI (also known as methicillin repressor) that constitutively blocks mecA transcription. The three-dimensional structure of MecI reveals a dimer of two independent winged helix domains, each of which binds a palindromic DNA-operator half site, and two intimately intertwining dimerization domains of novel spiral staircase architecture, held together by a hydrophobic core. Limited proteolytic cleavage by cognate MecR1 within the dimerization domains results in loss of dimer interaction surface, dissociation, and repressor release, which triggers MecA synthesis. Structural information on components of the MecA regulatory pathway, in particular on methicillin repressor, the ultimate transcriptional trigger of mecA-encoded methicillin resistance, is expected to lead to the development of new antimicrobial drugs.

In industrialized countries, as many as 60% of all hospital-acquired infections are caused by drug-resistant microbes, with derived costs of $10 billion and about 14,000 casualties a year in the United States alone. Virulent Staphylococcus aureus strains cause most nosocomial and community-onset infections by producing toxins and virulence factors, especially in immunocompromised patients. These strains may affect skin, urinary and respiratory tracts, soft tissue, burns, ulcers, bone, joints, and the cardiovascular system. In this way, they cause the potentially lethal toxic-shock syndrome, pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and severe invasive and metastatic infections. They are also responsible for 40–50% of all septicemias (1Emori T.G. Gaynes R.P. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). When penicillin was introduced in 1941, the pathogen could be combated efficiently. Since then, however, bacterial strains refractory to β-lactam antibiotics (BLAs) 1The abbreviations used are: BLA, β-lactam antibiotic; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DD, dimerization domain; ds, double-stranded; HTH, helix-turn-helix motif; MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; PDB, Protein Data Bank; SeMet, selenomethionine; V M, Matthews parameter, crystal volume per unit of protein molecular mass. began to appear (2Kirby W.M.M. Science. 1944; 99: 452-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These bacterial strains spread worldwide, causing high morbidity and mortality when untreated, which required the development of new drugs like penicillinase-resistant semi-synthetic β-lactams (e.g. methicillin) in the 1960s. However, the appearance of new insensible bacterial strains has continued and even worsened, leading to the appearance of multiple-drug resistance. The glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin, are the last effective drugs for the moment (3Schmitz F.-J. Jones M.E. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 1997; 9: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounts for more than 30% of all pathogenic S. aureus isolates (3Schmitz F.-J. Jones M.E. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 1997; 9: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has caused several outbreaks in acute care and nursing wards since its appearance in 1961, less than one year after the introduction of methicillin (4Jevons M.P. Brit. Med. J. 1961; 1: 124-125Crossref Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). MRSA remains endemic in many hospitals because of the selective pressure created by the therapeutic and prophylactic use of antibiotics, and its incidence is increasing in many countries (5Ayliffe G.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1997; 24: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, outbreaks of non-nosocomial MRSA infections are becoming more common, posing a serious public health threat. Since 1996, strains have appeared that are essentially untreatable by BLAs, vancomycin, or latest-generation antibiotics (6Hiramatsu K. Aritaka N. Hanaki H. Kawasaki S. Hosoda Y. Hori S. Fukuchi Y. Kobayashi I. Lancet. 1997; 350: 1670-1673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Recently, an international consortium has set up a data base of epidemic MRSA strains to enable early identification (7Murchan S. Kaufmann M.E. Deplano A. de Ryck R. Struelens M. Zinn C.E. Fussing V. Salmenlinna S. Vuopio-Varkila J. El Solh N. Cuny C. Witte W. Tassios P.T. Legakis N. van Leeuwen W. van Belkum A. Vindel A. Laconcha I. Garaizar J. Haeggman S. Olsson-Liljequist B. Ransjo U. Coombes G. Cookson B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1574-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Such efforts must be complemented by discoveries of the molecular mechanisms of methicillin resistance and by novel therapeutic alternatives to control and defeat the pathogenic agent responsible. Constitutive penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are membrane-bound penicillinoil serine d,d-transpeptidases, structurally related to β-lactamases, that cross-link the peptidoglycan in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria (8Ghuysen J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 372-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 9McKinney T.K. Sharma V.K. Craig W.A. Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6862-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). BLAs target PBPs on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane because of structural analogy with their natural substrate, d-alanyl-d-alanine-terminated peptides. PBPs are acylated by BLAs at their active-site serine residues, subsequently deacylating very slowly. This prevents PBPs from performing their regular functions efficiently, leading to cell wall loosening. This is followed by a non-lytic killing event and, finally, bacteriolysis (10Chambers H.F. Trends Microbiol. 2003; 11: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Giesbrecht P. Kersten T. Maidhof H. Wecke J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1371-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial resistance occurs mainly through excreted β-lactamases (penicillinases), which inactivate penicillins by hydrolysis of their β-lactam ring (12Richmond M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1965; 90: 370-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MRSA, however, bases its resistance on the production of MecA (also known as PBP2a and PBP2′). This enzyme is a facultative PBP with reduced β-lactam affinity at the clinically achievable drug concentrations and is capable of essential cell wall construction when the housekeeping β-lactam-sensitive PBPs are switched off (13Hartman B.J. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 513-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, MecA confers imperviousness to all BLAs. It is encoded by mecA, localized within 32–60-kb DNA regions called mec complexes or staphylococcal chromosome cassettes mec (SCCmec elements; Refs.14Hiramatsu K. Cui L. Kuroda M. Ito T.

SCCmec elements have been acquired through horizontal transfer from an unknown heterologous source (16Crisóstomo M.I. Westh H. Tomasz A. Chung M. Oliveira D.C. de Lencastre H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9865-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). MecA synthesis is regulated by a signal transduction system consisting of an integral-membrane zinc-dependent metalloprotease sensor/signal transducer, MecR1, and a constitutive transcriptional repressor, methicillin repressor MecI, both located immediately upstream from the mecA promoter on mec elements and counter-transcribed (4Jevons M.P.

The MecR1-MecI-MecA system has a close functional and structural relative encoded by the β-lactamase divergon (bla), the BlaR1-BlaI-BlaZ (also known as BlaR-BlaI-BlaP or PenJ-PenI-PenP) protein triad (17Hiramatsu K. Asada K. Suzuki E. Okonogi K. Yokota T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 377-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, the encoded effector is a β-lactamase, BlaP, also known as BlaZ or PenP (20Novick R.P. Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 229-235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MecR1 is present in S. aureus and Staphylococcus sciuri, whereas BlaR1 (also known as BlaR, PenR1, or PenJ) has been found in Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus epidermis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and several S. aureus strains (21Zhu Y. Englebert S. Joris B. Ghuysen J.M. Kobayashi T. Lampen J.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6171-6178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are either plasmid-encoded, chromosomal, or transposon-mediated. MecR1/BlaR1 proteins are made up by homologous N-terminal ∼330-residue transmembrane metalloprotease domains linked to extracellular ∼260-residue homologous PBP-like penicillin sensor moieties (22Hardt K. Joris B. Lepage S. Brasseur R. Lampen J.O. Frere J.M. Fink A.L. Ghuysen J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). MecI/BlaI repressors are encoded by the same operon as MecR1/BlaR1. They are ∼125-amino acid proteins found in a number of bacterial genomes (Fig. 1) and are highly homologous to each other, with S. aureus MecI and BlaI sharing 61% and S. aureus MecI and B. licheniformis BlaI/PenI 43% sequence homology (23Rowland S.J. Dyke K.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These proteins are dimeric and may interact with cognate operators as dimers. These repressors have been proposed to consist of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) featuring a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif and a C-terminal dimerization domain (DD) (24Wittman V. Lin H.C.

Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2160-2166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory regions of the bla and mec elements are 57% identical (17Hiramatsu K. Asada K. Suzuki E. Okonogi K. Yokota T. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Indeed, both repressor systems seem to be interchangeable to block transcription of both structural and regulatory genes in S. aureus (28Lewis R.A. Dyke K.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 45: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 29Hackbarth C.J. Chambers H.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sensor/transducers BlaR1 and MecR1, however, are not interchangeable, and they have distinct kinetics; whereas S. aureus BlaR1 induces BlaZ synthesis within minutes, MecR1 takes hours to induce synthesis of MecA (9McKinney T.K. Sharma V.K. Craig W.A. Archer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6862-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Based on biochemical data mainly from the bla divergon proteins, the MecR1/MecI system is thought to work as follows. Dimeric MecI constitutively blocks mecA transcription via inhibition of mRNA synthesis initiation or elongation. Through recognition of regulatory regions of the counter-transcribed mecR1-mecI operon, the repressor also regulates its own transcription and that of the signal sensor/transducer. MecR1 detects BLAs in the extracellular space via its PBP-like penicillin sensor. Upon protein acylation, a conformational change within MecR1 leads to autocatalytic activation of the integral-membrane metalloprotease domain. The active protease facing the cytosol specifically cleaves MecI, directly or indirectly. In the case of the BlaR1-BlaI-BlaZ system, some authors have postulated that a further, chromosome-encoded regulatory element, BlaR2, is required for BlaI inactivation (25Filée P. Vreuls C.

Cloning and Overexpression of MecI—S. aureus strain N315 (MRSA) bacterial cells were grown in Luria Bertani broth and lysed with lysostaphin (25 μg/ml). The DNA was extracted as described (35López P. Espinosa M. Piechowska M. Shugar D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 50-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used as a template for PCR amplification of the MecI coding sequence. Taq polymerase (Fermentas) was used with oligonucleotides 5′-GTTAATACCATGGATAATAAAACGTATG-3′ as forward primer and 5′-AAACACAACTAGTTTATTTTTTATTCAAT-3′ as reverse primer (purchased from Roche Applied Science). The reaction yielded a 393-bp fragment containing the correct coding sequence within restriction sites for NcoI (5′) and BcuI (3′). After digestion with these enzymes, the fragment was inserted into expression vector pPROEX™ Hta (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing confirmed that the MecI coding sequence was properly placed after the sequence encoding the His6 tag and the tobacco etch virus protease recognition site. Reactions with restriction endonucleases (Fermentas) and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science) were performed as recommended by the suppliers. The recombinant plasmid obtained was introduced into Escherichia coli DH5α cells by heat shock treatment. Freshly transformed cells were cultured overnight in Luria Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. For overexpression, 4 ml of these cultures was added to 500 ml of Luria Bertani medium, also 100 μg/ml in ampicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.5. After 3 h of incubation at the same temperature, cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen. The selenomethionine (SeMet) variant was obtained in the same way, except that the cells were added to 500 ml of minimal medium lacking methionine and implemented with 25 mg of SeMet (Sigma) 30 min before induction. Purification and Crystallization of MecI—Pelleted cells were gently melted at 4 °C, resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole), and disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction was separated by ultracentrifugation, and the supernatant was passed through 0.22-μm filters and loaded onto a Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences), charged with Ni2SO4, and equilibrated with buffer A. The His6-tobacco etch virus site-MecI fusion protein (17.8 kDa) was eluted with a linear gradient of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 400 mm imidazole). The total protein concentration (9 mg/ml) was measured according to Bradford (Bio-Rad) using lysozyme as a standard. EDTA and 1,4-dithio-d,l-threitol were added to the fractions containing the fusion protein to a final concentration of 0.5 and 1 mm, respectively. Tobacco etch virus protease was added at a 1:500 (protease:fusion protein) molar ratio to remove the His6 tag. After overnight digestion at 22 °C, the sample was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/65 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl). 3 ml of MecI (14.9 kDa) in buffer C was obtained at a final concentration of 1.25 mg/ml (as calculated with the experimentally determined molar extinction coefficient, ϵ = 35413 m–1 cm–1) and stored at 4 °C. The purity of the protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, and its N terminus was found by chemical sequencing to be GAMDNK (amino acid one-letter code), including a glycine-alanine dipeptide from the tobacco etch virus protease recognition sequence prior to the first methionine of native MecI. The protein crystallized spontaneously in the chromatography collection tubes overnight at 4 °C in the form of well-shaped, ordered crystals. The same crystals were obtained with SeMet-MecI. DNA Binding Assay—To test the DNA-binding capability of MecI, two complementary oligonucleotides (5′-CAAAATTACAACTGTAATATCGGAG-3′ and 5′-GCTCCGATATTACAGTTGTAATTTT-3′) purchased from MWG Biotech AG) were annealed in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl) to render 180 nmol of a 25-bp double-stranded (ds) DNA comprising the sequence protected from DNase I attack of the Z-dyad of the bla divergon (19Clarke S.R. Dyke K.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2001; 47: 377-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with an additional 1-bp overhang on either side (C/G). Purified MecI (85 μm) in buffer C was mixed with DNA in buffer D at a 2:1.1 protein:dsDNA molar ratio. The mixture was diluted 1:4 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated 15 min at 4 °C before being loaded onto a gel filtration Superdex 75 HR 10/65 column equilibrated with buffer E (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl). A single peak was obtained and analyzed with a band-shift assay in a 5% acrylamide gel with 5% glycerol and 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.3, using annealed oligonucleotides as a negative control. Analytical Gel Filtration and Cross-linking Experiments—To assess the concentration-dependent aggregation states of MecI, a peak fraction of the last purification step, which rendered crystals, was diluted with buffer C and subjected to analytical gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR 10/65 column previously calibrated with protein markers of known molecular mass and equilibrated with buffer F (50 mm Hepes. pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl). Resulting peaks revealed by SDS-PAGE a single band corresponding to a protein monomer. 140 pmol purified MecI was cross-linked at room temperature with glutaraldehyde at different concentrations in a total volume of 50 μl of buffer for 2 min, followed by quenching with 12 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The products were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Structure Solution and Refinement—Native MecI crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, harbor one MecI dimer per asymmetric unit (Matthews parameter (V M) = 3.1 Å3/Da; 59.5% solvent content; Ref. 36Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar), and diffract beyond 2.4 Å resolution. SeMet-derivatized protein crystals are fairly isomorphous to the native ones and diffract to 2.8 Å resolution (Table I). A cryoprotecting protocol was established consisting of soaking crystals in a mixture containing crystal supernatant protein solution and increasing (5% steps) glycerol concentrations (up to 25% v/v) at 4 °C, allowing the crystals to equilibrate for 15 min after each step. Complete diffraction data sets were collected from a single N2 flash-cryo-cooled (Oxford Cryosystems) crystal, each on an ADSC Quantum4-charged coupled device detector at beamline ID29 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. For the SeMet derivative, a multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment was carried out at three wavelengths, corresponding to the absorption maximum (12662.53 eV), the inflection point (12660.95 eV), and a hard remote wavelength (12900 eV). These values were determined from the crystal to be measured by means of a fluorescence spectrum around the theoretical selenium K-edge value. All diffraction data were processed with program MOS-FLM v. 6.2.2 and scaled, merged, and reduced with SCALA, within the CCP4 suite of programs (Ref. 37Collaborative Computing Project 4.Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab The heavy atom model of the SeMet derivative could not be determined in P212121 by any procedure. All tests for hemihedral twinning were negative. Consequently, the diffraction data were reprocessed as P21, choosing the short axis as unique axis b. With this setting, 10 of 16 theoretical selenium sites were found with SOLVE v. 1.18 (38Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar), giving a figure of merit of 0.33 for the resolution range of 50–2.9 Å (Table I). Subsequent density modification by means of DM within CCP4 increased this value to 0.66, rendering a map where some helical segments could be identified. The four molecules in the P21 asymmetric unit were delimited, and non-crystallographic symmetry operators were calculated. A second step, including averaging, delivered a σA-weighted electron-density map (Fig. 3a) that enabled straightforward tracing of the whole polypeptide chain employing a Silicon-Graphics graphic work station and program TURBO-FRODO (Biographics, Marseille, France). A model comprising a dimer was submitted to a molecular replacement calculation, employing program AMORE (39Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

https://openalex.org/W1990320961,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated when cells are exposed to noxious stimuli. The role of JNK in apoptosis is subject to considerable debate; for example, JNK activation may promote or inhibit apoptosis depending on the cell type and stimulus involved. These conflicting results have arisen in part because few studies have successfully separated JNK activation from the primary stress-induced damage or from other stress-induced signalling pathways. Here we describe a conditional mutant, deltaMEKK1:ER*, which allows selective activation of the JNK cascade in the absence of any cellular stress. Activation of deltaMEKK1:ER* in CC139 fibroblasts resulted in the rapid and sustained activation of JNK without activating ERK or p38 or promoting IkappaBalpha phosphorylation. Activation of deltaMEKK1:ER* caused a reversible halt in cell growth but failed to induce apoptosis. In contrast, treatment of cells with LY294002, to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), caused downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and allowed deltaMEKK1:ER* to elicit a robust apoptotic response characterized by activation of Bax and caspases. This PI3K-inhibitable, JNK-induced death response was not impeded, but actually accelerated, by cycloheximide. This suggests that JNK-induced activation of Bax and cell death does not require the upregulation of pro-death genes such as Bim or FasL, but rather proceeds through pre-existing components. However, if the PI3K cell survival pathway is not inhibited, even sustained activation of JNK exerts no overt proapoptotic effect in CC139 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2011929910,"Retinoids can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of various tumor cells. It is thought that nuclear retinoid receptors mediate these effects by regulating gene transcription. The identity of specific retinoid target genes is only beginning to be unraveled. One candidate for mediating retinoid-induced growth suppression is the novel class II tumor suppressor gene tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG3). We examined the constitutive and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-inducible expression of TIG3 mRNA in five head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and five nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell lines to determine whether it is associated with their responsiveness to ATRA. The expression patterns of retinoic acid receptor beta (RARbeta), another putative retinoid-inducible tumor suppressor gene, were also examined. The constitutive TIG3 expression was high in one HNSCC cell line and two NSCLC cell lines, and moderate to very low in the other cells. Some RARbeta-expressing cells had either low or undetectable TIG3 levels and vice versa. ATRA (1 microM; 48 h) increased TIG3 mRNA in 4/5 HNSCCs and 3/5 NSCLCs and RARbeta mRNA in some of the same cell lines, but also in cells that did not show TIG3 induction. TIG3 mRNA was induced by ATRA between 6 and 12 h in most of the responsive cells. ATRA concentrations required for TIG3 induction ranged from 1 to 500 nM depending on the cell line. The pan-RAR antagonists AGN193109 and the RARalpha antagonist Ro 41-5253 blocked TIG3 induction by ATRA. ATRA suppressed anchorage-independent colony formation in most cells that had a high or moderate constitutive or induced TIG3 expression level. In contrast, RARbeta mRNA expression pattern was not correlated with sensitivity to ATRA. These results suggest that TIG3 is regulated by ATRA via retinoid receptors in certain aerodigestive tract cancer cells, and its induction by ATRA is associated with the suppression of anchorage-independent growth."

https://openalex.org/W2082026276,"The Fur protein is a global regulator of iron metabolism and other processes in many bacterial species. A key feature of the model of Fur function is the recognition of a DNA element within target promoters with similarity to a 19-bp AT-rich palindromic sequence called a Fur box. The irr gene from Bradyrhizobium japonicum is under the control of Fur. Here, we provide evidence that B. japonicum Fur (BjFur) binds to the irr gene promoter with high affinity despite the absence of DNA sequence similarity to the Fur box consensus. Both Escherichia coli Fur and BjFur bound a synthetic Fur box consensus DNA element in electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays, but only BjFur bound the irr promoter. BjFur maximally protected a 30-bp region in DNase I footprinting analysis that includes three imperfect direct repeat hexamers. BjFur formed a high mobility complex and a low mobility complex with DNA in electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays corresponding to occupancy by a single dimer and two dimers or a tetramer, respectively. A mutation in the downstream direct repeat DNA sequence allowed high mobility complex formation only. In vitro transcription from the wild type irr promoter or from a mutated promoter that allowed only dimer occupancy was repressed by Fur, indicating that the dimer can be a functional repressor unit. Our findings identify a novel DNA-binding element for Fur and suggest that the Fur box consensus may not completely represent the target sequences for bacterial Fur proteins as a whole.

In addition, Fur binding to a target promoter is sufficient to repress transcription in vitro. Control of iron homeostasis is essential to most living organisms. Iron is required for many cellular processes but can be unavailable because it is insoluble in its predominant ferric (Fe3+) form. However, excess iron is toxic because it catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, protein, and lipids. Organisms have specific mechanisms to control iron acquisition and to store it in an inert form. In bacteria, studies on the control of iron homeostasis have focused largely on Fur (ferric uptake regulator), a regulatory protein that responds to cellular iron. Fur represses genes that are involved in high affinity iron transport under iron replete conditions and that are derepressed when the metal is scarce. In addition, Fur is involved in numerous other facets of iron metabolism and also in processes not obviously linked to iron, such as acid shock response (1Hall H.K. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5683-5691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), synthetic pathways (2Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol.

These proteins differ in function and have different DNA-binding sites but are all involved in metal-dependent control of gene expression. Fur homologs are found in many bacterial genomes, but the protein has been studied in relatively few of them. Structural analysis of Fur and its DNA binding properties has been most extensively studied in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis, whereas analyses of fur mutants and the identification of genes under Fur control have also been studied in those bacteria and in several other organisms as well. P. aeruginosa Fur was crystallized as a dimer (9Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol.

In addition, Fur binds two zinc atoms/monomer; one zinc has a structural function, and the other may be the ferrous iron-binding site in vivo (9Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W.

However, the E. coli protein binds DNA when one or both metal sites is occupied by zinc (13Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cysteines are zinc ligands in E. coli (13Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Jacquamet L. Aberdam D. Adrait A. Hazemann J.-L. Latour J.-M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2564-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) but not in P. aeruginosa (9Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The working model for Fur function posits that, when bound by ferrous (Fe2+) iron, Fur binds its target DNA within the promoter of the regulated gene to repress transcription. However, when iron is limiting in the cell, Fur protein is unbound by iron and no longer binds DNA with high affinity, hence gene expression is derepressed. It is generally assumed that Fur binding blocks access of RNA polymerase to the promoter to repress transcription, but this has not been demonstrated directly, nor have the possibilities that Fur excludes an activator or recruits a repressor been ruled out. Central to the model is the so-called Fur box, a DNA-binding element for Fur that contains similarity to a 19-bp, AT-rich palindromic consensus sequence (Fig. 1). This consensus sequence was originally derived from examination of promoters of numerous Fur-regulated genes (12Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent searches have yielded one promoter that matches the Fur box consensus exactly (15Baichoo N. Wang T. Ye R. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), with 14- or 15-bp matches out of 19 being more typical and 11 bp as a minimum match (15Baichoo N. Wang T. Ye R. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1613-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 16Tsolis R.M. Baumler A.J. Stojiljkovic I. Heffron F. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4628-4637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ochsner U.A. Vasil M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4409-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity to a Fur box consensus within promoter regions of genes is taken as ab initio evidence for regulation by Fur. The assumption that Fur recognizes the two 9-bp inverted repeats of the palindrome was challenged by studies that interpret the consensus as three shorter hexameric repeats in a head-to-head-to-tail orientation (18Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Yet a third interpretation of the consensus using B. subtilis Fur is a two 7-1-7 inverted repeat motif that accommodates two dimers (19Baichoo N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no discrepancy in the sequence of the Fur-binding element consensus in those studies but rather in the interpretation of the functional pattern within that sequence. Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a Gram-negative bacterium that lives as a free-living organism or in symbiosis with soybean. The B. japonicum fur gene was identified based on functional complementation of an E. coli mutant (20Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been characterized in Rhizobium leguminosarum (21Wexler M. Todd J.D. Kolade O. Bellini D. Hemmings A.M. Sawers G. Johnston A.W. Microbiology (U. K.). 2003; 149: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and homologs are found in the genomes of other taxonomically related organisms within the α-proteobacterial group as well. Fur is involved in controlling iron metabolism in B. japonicum (20Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (U. K.). 2000; 146: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) but appears to play a lesser role in R. leguminosarum (21Wexler M. Todd J.D. Kolade O. Bellini D. Hemmings A.M. Sawers G. Johnston A.W. Microbiology (U. K.). 2003; 149: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition to Fur, the Irr protein in B. japonicum is involved in iron metabolism, where it mediates iron-dependent regulation of heme biosynthesis (7Hamza I. Chauhan S. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21669-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The irr gene is controlled by iron at both transcriptional (22Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (U. K.). 2000; 146: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and post-translational levels (8Qi Z. Hamza I. O'Brian M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13056-13061Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 23Qi Z. O'Brian M.R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Evidence for Fur-mediated transcriptional control is based on the observations that iron-dependent accumulation of irr mRNA is aberrant in a fur mutant, and extracts from E. coli cells harboring the B. japonicum fur gene bind to DNA upstream of the irr gene (22Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (U. K.). 2000; 146: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the irr promoter region does not contain DNA sequence similar to the Fur box consensus, indicating an important difference between the B. japonicum Fur protein and the other proteins on which the Fur box consensus sequence is based. In this study, we provide evidence for a novel DNA binding activity for B. japonicum Fur in the irr gene promoter, suggesting that the Fur box consensus may not completely represent the target sequence for bacterial Fur proteins as a whole. Furthermore, it is shown that Fur binding to the irr gene promoter is sufficient to repress transcription in vitro. Chemicals and Reagents—All chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, VWR Scientific, West Chester, PA, or J. T. Baker Inc. Agar, purified noble agar, and yeast extract were purchased from Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth—E. coli strain DH5α was used for propagation of plasmids and was grown at 37 °C on LB media with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmid pSKiron contains the 19-mer Fur box consensus sequence 5′-GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3′ cloned into the ClaI site of pBluescript SK and was a gift from Dr. M. L. Vasil (24Ochsner U.A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7194-7201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pET14bjFur (Novagen, Madison, WI) contains the B. japonicum fur gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14b. B. japonicum fur was derived from parental strain USDA I110 (20Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pET14ecFur contains the E. coli fur gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14b. The resultant protein expressed from pET14b contains a histidine tag that is used for purification. Overexpression and Purification of Fur—Fur was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(plysS) cells containing fur in pET14b, initially grown on LB media containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Cells were inoculated from an overnight culture grown in LB media containing chloramphenicol and ampicillin into 1 liter of fresh 2× YT containing antibiotics, 50 μm FeCl3, and 1 mm ZnCl2. Overexpression was induced in cells at mid-log phase by adding 20 ml/liter of 95% ethanol and a final concentration of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then incubating at 20 °C for 4 h with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, washed in TNG (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.4), and resuspended in 15 ml of phosphate binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0), 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25.5 μg of aprotinin/5 g of cells. Cells were disrupted by passage twice through a French pressure cell at 1200 p.s.i. and clarified by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 45 min. 1 ml of 50% Ni-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; BjFur, B. japonicum Fur; EcFur, E. coli Fur; DR, direct repeat; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HMC, high mobility complex; LMC, low mobility complex. slurry (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to 4 ml of clear lysate and rocked for 60 min at 4 °C. The Ni-NTA slurry-protein mixture was poured into a column and washed three times with 25 ml of phosphate wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8). Purified His-Fur was eluted with phosphate elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8). The His tag was cleaved by adding 3 units of thrombin (Novagen, Madison, WI) per 2 mg of His-Fur and incubating at room temperature for 2 h. To remove imidazole, Fur was further purified by retention through a 3-kDa nominal molecular weight limit Ultrafree column (Millipore, Billercia, MA). The His tag was removed by resuspending the retentate in 1.2 ml of 50% Ni-NTA/300 μl of purified Fur and loading on a column. The eluate was collected in fractions, and fractions containing purified Fur were combined. Protein was diluted to a 1 μm working stock solution in electrophoretic gel mobility shift (EMSA) binding buffer (10 mm bis-Tris borate, 1 mm MgCl2,40mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were used to determine Fur binding to DNA. The presence of manganese was necessary for DNA binding activity of Fur. Mn2+ presumably substitutes for Fe2+, but the latter is readily oxidized to Fe3+ in air. Using a protocol modified from de Lorenzo et al. (25de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a 20-μl volume of EMSA binding buffer supplemented with 50 ng of herring sperm DNA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2, and radiolabeled DNA probe. 100 pm DNA probe was used for Kd determination and competition experiments, 1 nm DNA probe was used for all other experiments. Double-stranded DNA probes were produced by boiling and slowly cooling synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) in annealing buffer (150 mm NaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and filled in with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) with the klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Following incubation, EMSA reactions were analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in electrophoresis buffer (20 mm bis-Tris borate, pH 7.5) that were prerun for 30 min at 200 V of constant voltage. After electrophoresis at 4 °C for 45–90 min at 200 V, gels were dried and autoradiographed. The Fur box probe was isolated as an 83-bp fragment from a NotI and XhoI digestion of pSKIron. A BanII and HpaI digest of pSKSBIrr was used to isolate a 63-bp fragment containing the irr promoter. A NotI and XhoI digestion of pBluescript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to isolate a 69-bp fragment used as nonspecific DNA. Autoradiograms were developed on BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and scanned using a GS-700 densitometer (Bio-Rad), and signal intensities were detected and quantified using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). To determine the dissociation binding constant (Kd), binding reactions were titrated with various concentrations of Fur. Bound and unbound DNA was quantified by comparing relative signal intensities and analyzed using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). DNA probes used to delimit sequence sufficient for Fur binding in the irr promoter were initially synthesized as overlapping fragments and compared by EMSA. After identifying a 39-bp probe that was sufficient for both low and high mobility complex formation, base substitutions using nonspecific sequence were used to progressively alter the 5′ and 3′ ends of the probe, further refining small DNA regions sufficient for formation of each individual complex and both complexes. Competition Assays—The relative affinity of B. japonicum Fur for Fur box and irr promoter DNA was determined by competition of one of the radiolabeled DNAs with the other unlabeled DNA in EMSA analysis. In the first case, 100 pm32P-labeled irr promoter DNA was incubated with 50 nm BjFur in the binding reaction along with 1–100-fold excess of irr promoter DNA, Fur box DNA, or nonspecific DNA. In the second case, the experiment was carried out in the same way except that the Fur box was radiolabeled. DNase I Footprint Analysis—DNase I footprint analyses examined the DNA region protected by Fur binding. Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a 50-μl volume EMSA binding buffer containing 125 ng of herring sperm DNA, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2, and 1 nm radiolabeled irr promoter DNA. The DNA was labeled at one end with [α-32P]dCTP and the klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. 50 μlof room temperature solution of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2 was added after 1 min followed by the addition of 0.45 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) in 18 μlof40mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The reaction was incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml yeast RNA). DNA was extracted with phenol:choloroform (1:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. G + A ladders of the labeled DNA were produced as described (26Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Digested probe products were separated on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in Tris borate EDTA electrophoresis buffer. Autoradiograms were developed on BioMax film. The DNA probe used for DNase I footprint analysis was radiolabeled at the 3′ end; therefore, the top of the gel represents the 5′ end. Determination of the Mass of Fur-DNA Complexes—An EMSA-based method for determining the molecular weight of protein-DNA complexes was carried out as described previously (27Orchard K. May G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3335-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). EMSA reactions as described above were run on nondenaturing gels with protein standards. Using autoradiography of Coomassie-stained gels, logarithms of relative mobility (Rm) for EMSA complexes and native proteins were plotted against acrylamide concentration, showing the relationship of the mobility of each species and gel concentration. The negative slope of Rm for each protein standard was plotted against molecular weight to generate a standard curve from which the estimated molecular weight of each EMSA complex was interpolated. In Vitro Transcription Assays—To directly examine the influence of B. japonicum Fur on transcription from the irr promoter, in vitro transcription assays were performed on native and altered irr promoter DNA. irr promoter fragments were generated by PCR amplification of irr sequence in pSKSBIrr using primers 5′-TTTGAATTCGTGACCAAAATCGGCTAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGCAGGGACGTCGTCGTCGTGAT-3′, producing a 272-bp DNA fragment that terminated 80 bp downstream of the irr transcription start site determined previously (22Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (U. K.). 2000; 146: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar PCR reactions were performed on pSKSBIrr derivatives with four base pair alterations that independently affected formation of the high mobility complex or low mobility complex but did not mutate the putative –35 box. pSKSBIrr derivatives were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in EMSA buffer without glycerol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 4 nm irr promoter DNA in a 10-μl volume. 0.5 units of RNA polymerase (Epicenter, Madison, WI) was added, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, after which 10 μl of a preheated NTP mix (100 μm MnCl2, 250 μm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 20 μm UTP, 8 μm [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mMol in 10 μl H2O)) was added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Transcription products were run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in Tris borate EDTA electrophoresis buffer alongside a low range RNA ladder (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, MA) labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The sizes of RNA transcripts were determined by comparing logarithms of Rm of the RNA ladder standards versus the RNA transcripts. B. japonicum Fur Binds to the irr Promoter—Previous work shows that the iron-dependent control of irr mRNA expression is aberrant in a fur mutant and that E. coli extracts that overexpress B. japonicum Fur (BjFur) bind to DNA corresponding to the irr gene upstream region (22Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (U. K.). 2000; 146: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, a Fur box-like element was not found in this region. To further study this interaction, we overexpressed and purified recombinant Fur proteins from E. coli (EcFur) and B. japonicum and examined their DNA binding activities by EMSA (Fig. 2). Recombinant BjFur bound to a 63-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the irr upstream region. EcFur, however, did not bind to this DNA; 50 nm BjFur was sufficient to bind all of the DNA in the EMSA assay (Fig. 2), but up to 150 nm EcFur did not bind the irr gene promoter (data not shown). The B. japonicum fur gene complements an E. coli mutant (20Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with that observation, BjFur bound to the Fur box consensus sequence, as did EcFur (Fig. 2). Thus, BjFur has a unique DNA binding activity in addition to that found in the E. coli protein. This activity presumably allows BjFur to regulate the irr gene despite the absence of a Fur box consensus element in the irr promoter. The affinity of BjFur for the irr promoter and Fur box consensus DNA was assessed by measuring bound DNA as a function of BjFur concentration in an EMSA assay (Fig. 3A). The dissociation binding constants (Kd) for the two DNA elements were nearly identical and estimated to be 5.1 and 4.4 nm for the irr promoter and the Fur box, respectively. The relative affinities of the two DNA elements for BjFur were also assessed by competition EMSA analysis (Fig. 3, B and C). Binding of BjFur to radiolabeled irr promoter DNA was competed out by unlabeled Fur box DNA as effectively as by unlabeled irr promoter DNA (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated using radiolabeled Fur box DNA (Fig. 3C). Thus, the BjFur DNA-binding regions for each element are the same or overlapping. The data indicate that binding of BjFur to the irr promoter is similar to its binding to a known Fur target element, and therefore, it is likely to be physiologically relevant. These findings suggest that control of irr gene by Fur involves direct binding of Fur to the irr promoter. The BjFur-binding Region of the irr Promoter Contains Three Imperfect Direct Repeat Sequences Dissimilar from the Fur Box Consensus—The BjFur-binding region in the irr promoter was further defined by DNase footprinting (Fig. 4). The promoter was maximally occupied at 10 nm BjFur, resulting in approximately a 30-bp protected region. EMSA analysis using various double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides representing different regions of the irr promoter also delimited the BjFur binding to this region (see below). The DNA binding region was found to extend from –48 to –19 with respect to the transcription start site (+1) and contains three imperfect direct repeat hexameric sequences (Fig. 5). Two tandem repeats of TGCATC are preceded by a TGCGAG separated by 5 bp. The BjFur-binding site on the irr promoter has only 7 of 19 matches to the Fur box consensus (on the strand complementary to that shown in Fig. 5). The probability for a random match of 7 out of 19 is very high (0.1 based on calculations from Ref. 28von Hippel P.H. Berg O.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1608-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas the Fur box consensus can be interpreted as inverted repeat or direct repeat DNA, the BjFur-binding region of the irr promoter can only be interpreted as direct repeat DNA. From this, we conclude that binding of BjFur to DNA does not require the recognition of inverted repeat sequences.Fig. 5The BjFur-binding region in the irr promoter. Uppercase letters indicate the region protected by Fur in the DNase I footprinting analysis in Fig. 4. The arrows denote the three direct repeat sequences. Underlined sequences indicate the putative –35 and –10 regions. The +1 position is the transcription start site. HMC and LMC denote the DNA regions necessary to form a high mobility complex and low mobility complex, respectively, as described in Fig. 6 and under “Results.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of Fur to the irr Promoter Yields Two Complexes— Titration of irr promoter DNA with BjFur revealed two binding species in EMSA analysis (Fig. 6). At low BjFur concentrations, a high mobility complex (HMC) was predominant, whereas a low mobility complex (LMC) was prevalent at 50 nm protein. The footprinting analysis indicated a concentration-dependent occupancy of the irr promoter by BjFur (Fig. 4), and the two EMSA complexes are consistent with that observation. EMSA analysis was used to delimit the BjFur site on the irr promoter by first narrowing down the binding region to a 39-bp DNA fragment (Fig. 7). Subsequently, sequences on the left or right side of the 39-bp DNA were substituted with nonspecific sequence to keep the overall length constant. In addition, 5 and 50 nm BjFur were used for each DNA tested, which allows detection of the HMC and LMC, respectively. A fragment containing 29 bp of irr promoter DNA corresponding to the protected region in footprints gave both the HMC and LMC in the EMSA analysis (Fig. 7). Substitutions from the right side that eliminated some or all of the downstream direct repeat (DR3), but which kept DR1 and DR2 intact, resulted in loss of the LMC. However, the HMC was formed with that DNA and was observed at both 5"

Males of many animals provide females with 'nuptial gifts', such as prey items or glandular secretions, during courtship and mating1. Traditionally, nuptial feeding is viewed as a form of paternal investment in offspring2,3,4. Although other explanations have been proposed5,6,7, the focus remains gender-specific, with a male donor and female recipient. Here we show that females of the extraordinary insect Phoreticovelia disparata provide food for males during mating. This previously undescribed reversal of gender roles indicates that nuptial feeding might not be related to paternal investment."
https://openalex.org/W2054714683,"The majority of ovarian cancers (OCs) arise from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). Proliferation of the OSE can be regulated by a number of autocrine and paracrine factors, including transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta). Defects in the TGFbeta signaling pathway have been implicated in a number of cancers, including ovarian. We previously found that the TGFbeta signaling pathway is intact and functional in primary human OC cells, and that these cells stop growing in response to TGFbeta. Ovarian cancer cells in vivo are exposed to TGFbeta, yet continue to proliferate, therefore, mechanisms must exist to inhibit TGFbeta signaling contributing to uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Numerous signaling pathways converge with the TGFbeta pathway to modulate its effects, including signaling induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF). We hypothesized that EGF can modulate TGFbeta signaling and contribute to uncontrolled cellular proliferation of OC cells. Our results show that EGF abrogates the antiproliferative effect of TGFbeta. EGF does not modulate TGFbeta signaling by inhibiting receptor-activated Smad (R-Smad) phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Rather, EGF decreases TGFbeta-induced mRNA expression of the cell cycle regulator, p15(INK4B), contributing to decreased sensitivity of OC cells to the antiproliferative effect of TGFbeta."

Mutations in the BH3-only region of other BH3-only members lead to an inactive protein. We have investigated the mRNA expression of Noxa with real-time PCR in 94 unselected colorectal adenocarcinomas and the corresponding normal mucosa. Among them, Noxa protein expression was investigated with immunohistochemistry in 16 tumors and six corresponding normal mucosa samples. Further, we searched for Noxa mutations in all the cases using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. The mRNA expression of Noxa was weak in 9% and strong in 2% of the tumors, and decreased in 9% and increased in 16% of the tumors compared with the normal mucosa; however, these changes did not have any clinical or pathological significance. The protein level in most of the cases investigated was correlated with the mRNA level. We did not find any mutations in the Noxa gene. Thus, we suggest that Noxa may not be of importance in the development of colorectal cancer."

We have examined the kinetics of open complex formation at the lacP1 promoter using tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase and DNA fragments with 2-aminopurine substituted at specific positions. Apart from the closed complex formation and promoter clearance, we were able to detect three steps. The first step after the closed complex formation leads to a rapid increase of 2-aminopurine fluorescence. This was followed by another rapid step in which quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase was observed. The slowest step detected by 2-aminopurine fluorescence increase is assigned to the final open complex formation. We have found that CRP not only enhances RNA polymerase binding at the promoter, but also enhances the slowest isomerization step by about 2-fold. Furthermore, potassium permanganate probing shows that the conformation of the open complex in the presence of CRP appears qualitatively and quantitatively different from that in the absence of CRP, suggesting that contact with RNA polymerase is maintained throughout the transcription initiation.

Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar), and theoretically activation can occur by affecting any one of them. Recruitment of RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; 2-AP, 2-aminopurine; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. to a promoter is, of course, the first step in transcription initiation, which is followed by a series of isomerization steps. Despite recent availability of a great deal of structural information on RNA polymerase, elucidation of the process of open complex formation remains a major goal. It is difficult to obtain structural information about these intermediates as they are transiently populated during transcription initiation. Most of the information about the intermediates was obtained indirectly, and little is known about the intervening transition states. A direct method of studying the kinetics of isomerization steps would significantly help the dissection of the transcription initiation process. The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) can activate the transcription of a large number of operons of Escherichia coli (5Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Busby S. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). To activate transcription, CRP binds to a specific DNA site located upstream from a promoter and interacts with RNAP. CRP activates transcription by using two different modes of RNAP interaction. In most cases, CRP activates transcription from a point about 40 bp upstream of the start of transcription, but in others it interacts from a point at least 6 turns of DNA helix upstream from the transcription start site. The interaction points between CRP and RNAP are different depending on whether CRP is activating from the 40-bp upstream site or the other site. CRP was first identified as a transcription activator of the lac operon, where CRP binds at a site located 61.5 bp upstream of the start of transcription. From this site, CRP interacts with the α subunit of RNAP and helps recruit RNAP to the promoter. Whether the sole function of CRP at the lac promoter is to help RNAP bind to the promoter remains to be seen. The kinetics of transcription initiation by CRP at the lac promoter was examined by Malan et al. (7Malan T.P. Kolb A. Buc H. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 881-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By using abortive initiation studies, they found that CRP increased the KB of RNAP binding to the lac promoter but had no effect on the subsequent isomerization step. However, some later results suggested effects of CRP beyond the recruitment step, and hence we decided to take a more direct approach and measure the rates of different steps in isomerization by tryptophan fluorescence and fluorescence of the base analog 2-aminopurine (2-AP) incorporated into the DNA of the lac promoter. In this article we report kinetics of several isomerization steps and influence of CRP on each of them. Preparation of DNA Templates Containing 2-AP—Both normal and single 2-AP incorporated DNA templates were amplified by PCR. First, the ∼1.1-kb lac operon fragment was amplified from E. coli MG1655 genomic DNA. By using this DNA fragment as the template with the synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as forward primers (83 bases, Fig. 1), 778-bp DNA fragments (78 bp upstream sequence and 700 bp downstream sequence of the lac operon) containing the lac promoter were amplified. To abolish the activity of the P2 promoter of lac, a mutation at –29C→ T was introduced at the promoter (8Donnelly C.E. Reznikoff W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1812-1817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separation of PCR DNA Fragment from PCR Mixture—After 4-fold dilution by 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA), the PCR mixture was loaded on a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences), which was pre-equilibrated with TE buffer. After loading, the column was washed with 20 ml of TE buffer. Then two gradients (the first from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 10 ml of TE buffer and the second from 0.5 to 0.65 m NaCl in 30 ml of TE buffer) were used to elute the PCR DNA fragment from the Resource Q column at 1 ml/min. Proteins—RNAP was purified from E. coli K-12 cells (MG1655) as described (9Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The purified RNAP was found to be >95% pure by Coomassie staining of protein resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration for RNAP was determined as described (10Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). CRP was purified to 98% homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) from an E. coli strain carrying the wild type crp gene in the multicopy plasmid pHA5 (11Ryu S. Kim J. Adhya S. Garges S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Transcription in Vitro—All the in vitro transcription reactions in this study were carried out at 37 °C in 25 μl. At first, an initial mixture (10 nm DNA template, 40 nm RNAP, 1 mm ATP, 20 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.1 mm cAMP, 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 200 mm potassium acetate,1 mm dithiothreitol, with or without 50 nm CRP) was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then transcription was initiated by addition of 2.5 μl of NTP mixture (each 1 mm of GTP and CTP, 0.1 mm UTP, and 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP). The reaction was performed for 10 min before 25 μl of 2× stop buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% xylene cyanol, and 0.025% bromphenol blue) was added to terminate it. Samples were heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and 8 μl of each sample was loaded on a 6% sequencing gel to analyze the transcripts. Stopped-flow Kinetics—The experiments were carried out on an Applied Photophysics SX18MV stopped-flow apparatus in the fluorescence mode. RNAP in buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm cAMP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) was loaded in one syringe, and the single 2-AP-labeled lac promoter DNA, either in the presence or absence of CRP, in the same buffer was loaded in the other syringe. The enzyme and DNA (50 μl each) were rapidly mixed from separate syringes at a flow rate of 6.0 ml/s. The excitation monochromator was set at 315 nm with a slit width of 4 mm, and a photomultiplier tube and a 360-nm cut-off filter (transparent to light with a wavelength greater than 360 nm) were used to measure the 2-AP fluorescence signal. For tryptophan fluorescence experiments, the excitation wavelength was set at 283 nm, and 305-nm cut-off filter (high pass) was used to measure the emission intensity. Experiments were performed at 25 °C. During the progress of the reaction, the time-dependent changes in the fluorescence emission intensity of 2-AP were recorded as 1000 data points.

Promoter Clearance—Promoter clearance experiments were carried out on the same stopped-flow instrument at 25 °C. RNAP was mixed with 2-AP containing DNA either in the presence or the absence of CRP and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to ensure formation of an open complex (we previously checked that 30 min was sufficient for equilibrium to be established). Then the pre-incubated complex was rapidly mixed with a mixture of four NTPs (each concentration of 0.2 mm) and heparin (50 μg/ml). Measurements of the loss of 2-AP fluorescence signal were upon excitation at 315 nm and emission at ≥360 nm. Similarly, the kinetics traces were averaged from 10 traces. Kinetic Data Analysis—SigmaPlot 2000 was used to analyze the stopped-flow kinetics traces, as reported previously (12Bandwar R.P. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14075-14082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assuming the kinetics would be pseudo-first-order, the traces were fit using the single exponential Equation 1, F=A[1-exp(-kobst)]+C(Eq. 1) where F is the fluorescence (observed at ≥360 nm) at time t (seconds); k obs is the observed rate constant; A is the observed amplitude; and C is the fluorescence signal at t = 0. The pseudo-first-order rate constants thus obtained in different RNAP concentrations were plotted against RNAP concentration, and the corresponding plots were fit by a hyperbola equation (Equation 2) of non-linear regression analysis in SigmaPlot 2000. kobs=k2[RNAP]/(Kd+[RNAP])+k-2(Eq. 2) Measurement of the Rate by Manual Mixing—The reaction was carried out on a RTC-2000/S.E. spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International. Samples were excited at 315 nm (10 nm slit width), and the emission spectra of 370 nm (10 nm slit width) were measured. Prior to the measurement, the temperatures of all the reaction components and instruments were equilibrated at 25 °C. The fluorescence measurement and reaction were executed at 25 °C. Both RNAP and DNA samples were prepared in the buffer as used in stopped-flow assays. The complex formation between the promoter and RNAP was initiated by mixing 50 μl of DNA (70 nm) and 50 μl of RNAP (800 nm). Immediately after the mixing (time 0), the mixture was transferred to a cuvette (Hellma cells, 0.300). As a control, 50 μl of the same DNA was mixed with 50 μl of the buffer. The emission spectra from both samples were recorded every 3 s for more than 300 s. Permanganate Probing—The experiments followed a modification of the protocol described previously (13Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sullivan J.J. Bjornson K.P. Sowers L.C. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Promoter DNA was incubated with RNAP either in the presence or absence of CRP. Samples were then treated with potassium permanganate, which modified thymine residues in single-stranded or distorted regions of the duplex. In the experiments described here, each 100-μl reaction mix contained 20 nm DNA (778-bp PCR fragment) and 200 nm RNAP either in the presence or the absence of CRP (250 nm) in transcription buffer (as above). After incubation at 37 °C (or 25 °C) for 30 min, KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 12.5 mm. After 2 min, the reaction was quenched by adding 2-mercaptoethanol to 1 m. The DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and passage through a Sephadex G-25 spin column. 32P-Labeled primer (16-mer) was added, and the sample was heated for 4 min at 90 °C to denature the template DNA and then cooling at 45 °C for 15 min to hybridize. After extension with Klenow DNA polymerase, samples were electrophoresed on an 8% sequencing gel. Positional Effect of 2-AP on the lac Promoter Activity in Transcription in Vitro—A single 2-AP base was chemically incorporated separately at position –11 or +1 of the lac promoter in the non-template strand in place of the adenine base (Fig. 1). To study the effect of 2-AP on the function of the lac promoter, the six 778-bp PCR fragments, either with 2-AP at a different position or without 2-AP, were used as the templates for transcription in vitro either in the presence or the absence of CRP. As shown in Fig. 2, when a single 2-AP is located at position +1 of the lac promoter, compared with normal adenine-containing promoter (Fig. 2, Control), no obvious effect of 2-AP could be obtained on transcription in vitro, and CRP stimulated the transcription about 5–8-fold (transcript was quantified with a PhosphorImager, data not shown). 2-AP Destroyed the lac Promoter Activity When Located at Position–11 of the lac Promoter—The fluorescent base 2-AP is an isomer of normal adenine. It is believed that replacement of normal adenine by 2-AP would not seriously affect the structure of DNA, and 2-AP can be used as a non-perturbing and very sensitive probe to detect conformational changes (14Sullivan J.J. Bjornson K.P. Sowers L.C. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 15Sowers L.C. Fazakerley G.V. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

But in our studies, when 2-AP was located at position –11 of the lac promoter, in the absence of CRP, the promoter activity was lost both in transcription in vitro (Fig. 2) and in stopped-flow kinetics experiments (Fig. 3A). In transcription in vitro,no obvious lac RNA band was seen in the absence of CRP. However, note that CRP could restore activity to the debilitated promoter. In stopped-flow kinetics, no obvious time-dependent increase in 2-AP fluorescence change was obtained in the absence of CRP (Fig. 3A). As the control, the DNA template with 2-AP labeled at position +1 of the lac promoter indicated a clear signal change (Fig. 3B). In a previous article (20Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), it was observed that substitution of 2-AP at the –11 position blocked enhancement of permanganate activity to all thymines in the promoter region in galP1. The binding of RNA polymerase as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, however, appeared to be preserved (20Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that 2-AP substitution at –11 leads to a very early block in the pathway, perhaps immediately after the closed complex formation. Studies of the Effect of CRP on Open Complex Formation by Stopped-flow Kinetics and Manual Mixing—We used 2-AP fluorescence changes upon DNA strand separation to measure the kinetics of DNA binding and formation of open complex in a fluorometer equipped with stopped-flow capability. A 2-AP-modified and PCR-amplified DNA in which the 2-AP was located at position +1 of the lac promoter was chosen to use in this stopped-flow kinetics study. The representative kinetic traces are shown in Fig. 4, in which DNA (35 nm) was mixed with RNAP (550 nm) either in the absence (Fig. 4A) or presence of CRP (Fig. 4B). The fluorescence was excited at 315 nm and measured after passage through a 360-nm cut-off filter; 1000 points were accumulated over the 500-ms time course of the experiment. The data set fits very well in a single exponential, three-parameter equation, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An observed rate constant (k obs) was obtained from the curve drawn through the data points. At 550 nm RNAP, CRP had minor effect on the second step, increasing the rate constant slightly from 12.39 (s–1) (Fig. 4A) to 13.67 (s–1) (Fig. 4B). The rate of complex formation at 25 °C on the 2-AP containing template (35 nm) as a function of the RNAP concentration (200–1000 nm) either in the presence or in the absence of CRP is shown in Fig. 5. The corresponding plots fit very well to a hyperbolic equation, suggesting there are at least two steps in the DNA binding pathway, and two ED complexes are formed sequentially as shown in Equation 3, x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“39755eq3”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 3) where E is the RNAP; D is the dsDNA promoter; EDc is the closed complex; and ED 1 is the intermediate complex. Kd, k 2, and k –2 are the kinetic constants for the above reaction. Kd represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for RNAP (E) on the promoter (D) that forms the closed complex (EDc); k 2 and k –2 represent the rate constants for the isomerization reaction and reverse reaction, respectively. The values of the kinetic constants (Table I) were obtained by fitting the dependence to the hyperbolic Equation 2.Table IKinetics constant for interaction of RNAP and the lac promoterRate constants+CRP-CRPKd (μm)aThe dissociation constant was calculated from RNA polymerase concentration dependence of 2-AP fluorescence increase in the stopped-flow experiment.0.15 ± 0.030.56 ± 0.09Determined by stopped-flowk 2 (s-1)15.14 ± 0.149.10 ± 0.23k -2 (s-1)1.78 ± 0.167.86 ± 0.32k 3 (s-1)bSee Equation 6 for definition.2.53.3Determined by manual mixingk 4 (s-1)bSee Equation 6 for definition.3.04 × 10-31.75 × 10-3a The dissociation constant was calculated from RNA polymerase concentration dependence of 2-AP fluorescence increase in the stopped-flow experiment.b See Equation 6 for definition. Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 5 and Table I, CRP increases RNAP binding on the lac promoter about 4-fold, enhances the rate of the immediate isomerization step about 1.7-fold, and decreases the rate of the reverse step reaction about 4.5-fold. The stopped-flow experiments were repeated with unlabeled template while monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase. There is a quenching of tryptophan fluorescence, which can be fitted to a single exponential. This rate is significantly slower than 2-AP fluorescence increase rate, suggesting that this step follows the step in which 2-AP fluorescence increase occurs (Fig. 6 and Table I) We cannot estimate rate constant accurately through a longer time course on the stopped-flow instrument because of bleaching or drift problems occurring at extended times. So 2-AP fluorescence increase at the longer time course was monitored in a manual mixing experiment by a spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence increase occurs over a time frame of minutes indicating a slow step at which a further increase of 2-AP fluorescence occurs. The fluorescence increases both in the absence and in the presence of CRP and can be fitted to a single exponential. The obtained rate constants are 1.75 × 10–3 and 3.04 × 10–3 s–1, in the absence and the presence of CRP, respectively (Fig. 7). This is very likely to be the step that involves formation of open complex for two reasons. 1) After about 5 half-lives of the reaction, addition of NTPs causes promoter clearance as assayed by quenching of 2-AP fluorescence. 2) The rate constant of this step is very similar to that obtained from abortive initiation data by Malan et al. (7Malan T.P. Kolb A. Buc H. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 881-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (3 × 10–3 s–1). The relative amplitudes are estimated to be about 44% of total fluorescence change for the fast phase and 56% of total fluorescence change for the slow phase. These values were obtained from the extended time stopped-flow experiments, in which we used the template with 2-AP labeled at position +1 and a control experiment to correct for the machine drift and bleaching (data not shown). No Effect of CRP on Promoter Clearance—As an assay for promoter clearance, we also used the stopped-flow apparatus to measure the rate of promoter annealing upon addition of four NTPs to preformed open complexes. The open complex has a higher fluorescence than the free dsDNA. After RNAP was cleared from the promoter, a time-dependent decrease in fluorescence was observed either in the presence or the absence of CRP (Fig. 8). By using the single exponential Equation 1, two similar values of k obs were obtained either with CRP or without CRP, suggesting no effect of CRP on promoter clearance. But the observed amplitude is different. In the presence of CRP, A = 0.052 (Fig. 8B); in the absence of CRP, A = 0.041 (Fig. 8A), indicating more open complex available in the presence of CRP. Using Permanganate to Detect Open Complexes—Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) has been shown previously (21Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to oxidize pyrimidine residues, and the oxidation preferentially targets thymine residues in single-stranded DNA or distorted regions of the duplex. Therefore, permanganate probing is an efficient tool to detect various transcription complexes and study the mechanism of transcription factors (13Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8074-8081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primer extension pattern obtained when KMnO4 was used to modify the lac promoter either in the presence or the absence of CRP is shown in Fig. 9. Specifically, bands at –11, +1, +13, +15, and +16 along the bottom strand (Fig. 9A) become reactive both in the presence of RNAP and RNAP + CRP, but the intensities of these bands in the presence of CRP (Fig. 9A, lane 7) are about 2–8-fold for those without CRP (Fig. 9A, lane 6). The thymine residue at +2 appeared to be specifically reactive when CRP was present. In the top strand (Fig. 9B), compared with the control (Fig. 9B, lane 5), the thymine residues at –36, –35, –34, –28, –8, –7, –3, +3, and +4 exhibited hyperreactivity to permanganate either in the presence (Fig. 9B, lane 7) or the absence of CRP (Fig. 9B, lane 6), but the stops at these positions are stronger in the presence of CRP. In addition, bands at –29, –27, –22, –21, –15, –12, –10, and –5 occurred specifically or much more strongly in the presence of CRP. A similar result has been obtained at 25 °C (Fig. 9C). The results suggest that, in the presence of CRP, more transcription complexes are formed, and the conformation of those complexes might be different from those formed in the absence of CRP. The conformation of the promoter DNA might be changed by binding of CRP, which resulted in some of the bases becoming more easily accessible to KMnO4. We have re-examined the kinetics of transcription initiation of the lac promoter with and without CRP using 2-AP fluorescence increase kinetics, a direct measure for binding and isomerization. We emphasize here that fluorescence increase amplitudes of the steps are functions of quantum yields of the initial and final states, which may be affected by presence of CRP. Hence, it is difficult to relate the amplitudes to reaction progress or structure. The base analog 2-AP substituted for adenine at +1 position in the lac promoter without affecting promoter activity. The exception was substitution at –11 where the lac promoter activity was completely obliterated. Lim et al. (20Lim H.M. Lee H.J. Roy S. Adhya S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14849-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) found the same phenomenon when substituting for the adenine at –11 of the gal promoter. The (+1) 2-AP-substituted template was used for the detailed kinetic study here. This template was used for stopped-flow experiments to obtain information about the binding step and an early isomerization step. Manual mixing experiments were used to obtain information about a slower step. Tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase was used to obtain information about another early isomerization step, probably involving major conformational change in the polymerase. Finally, by addition of NTPs after open complex formation we were able to assay the promoter clearance step. By using (+1) 2-AP-substituted lac promoter DNA, we were able to measure the dissociation constant for the closed complex formation, which is 5.6 × 10–7m in the absence of CRP. Record and co-workers (22Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.E. Capp M.W. Record M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have determined a value of 3.7 × 10–8m at 28 °C for the λ-PR promoter under similar conditions. In the presence of CRP, the dissociation constant reduces about 4-fold to 1.5 × 10–7m. Clearly, CRP strongly augments the recruitment step, and in its presence the dissociation constant becomes comparable with that of a strong promoter like λ-PR. Malan et al. (7Malan T.P. Kolb A. Buc H. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 881-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) obtained KB values for the lacP1 from abortive initiation data at 37 °C, which are ∼7 × 10–8 and 5 × 10–9 (K –1B), without and with CRP, respectively. These values differ from our current estimate by approximately an order of magnitude. The two sets of values are difficult to compare as our templates contained T29C mutation and was conducted in 25 °C. In addition, no error estimate was given for the kinetic parameters obtained by abortive initiation. Because our values are derived by a direct assay on a template containing a lacP2 – mutation, it is likely to be more reliable. The stopped-flow experiments also indicate the presence of a rapid isomerization step in which the fluorescence of 2-AP increases with a forward rate constant of 9.1 and 15.1 s–1, without and with CRP, respectively. When the stopped-flow experiments were followed by tryptophan fluorescence of RNA polymerase, we observe a rapid quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with a rate constant of 2.4 and 1.76 s–1, with and without CRP, respectively. A fourth step can be measured from increase in 2-AP fluorescence by manual mixing experiments, which is assigned to the attainment of the catalytically competent open complex. The rate constants for this step in the absence and in the presence of CRP are 1.75 × 10–3 and 3.04 × 10–3 s–1, respectively. A complete kinetic scheme is shown in Equation 4. x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“39755eq4”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 4) The most interesting part of the kinetic profile of open complex formation at the lac promoter is the detection of an early step in which an increase of 2-AP fluorescence occurs. It is generally believed that fluorescence of 2-AP is significantly quenched in the stacked conformation within B-DNA and some deformation of the double helix is a pre-condition for relief of the quenching. This would suggest a significant deformation of the double helix, at least around (+1), occurs at a very early step of the pathway. Based on current structural data it has been proposed that a significant DNA distortion around the –10 region is necessary for binding of polymerase to both upstream and downstream regions during the early part of the pathway (22Saecker R.M.

It is possible that this distortion is propagated to the +1 region. It is interesting that the substitution of 2-AP at –11 leads to a very early block. Recent work from deHaseth and co-workers (23Tsujikawa L. Strainic M.G. Watrob H. Barkley M.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15334-15341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggests that 2-AP at that position may be immobilized in an RNA polymerase pocket. One possibility is that flipping of –11 adenine and interaction with RNA polymerase is necessary for the DNA distortion that is blocked by –11 2-AP substitution. However, other models of early promoter-polymerase interaction may explain this early conformational change in the promoter DNA as well. The potassium permanganate results show that there are increases in reactivity in the presence of CRP and RNAP compared with RNAP alone. Importantly, the differences are not only in magnitude but show that bases at –11, –3, –5, +1, +2, +3, and +4 have disproportionately more reactivity in the presence of CRP and RNAP. There are changes detected by the potassium permanganate probing in between the –10 and the –35 seen in the presence of CRP that are not seen in its absence. Thus, the increase in band intensities are not merely due to the presence of a greater amount of open complex in the population but likely to be due to CRP-polymerase contact preserved in the open complex. Several authors including Straney et al. (24Straney D.C. Straney S.B. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) found stabilization of the open complex at lac by CRP; our results are consistent with theirs. Previously, we have proposed that activators that increase the KB act by establishing contact between the activator and polymerase during the first ternary complex, and this contact may be preserved throughout or may even be strengthened (25Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This appears to occur in CRP activation of the lacP1 promoter. EDc is stabilized relative to the unbound form, and ED 1 is also stabilized relative to the EDc form indicating further enhancement of CRP-polymerase interaction. Although we do not know if any further stabilization occurs, the great deal of enhancement of permanganate sensitivity cannot rule that out. It is also instructive that CRP can partially overcome the block that results from substitution of –11 adenine by 2-AP, consistent with a broad role in the isomerization process. A previous report (7Malan T.P. Kolb A. Buc H. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 881-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) on measuring the kinetic parameters of transcription initiation at the lac promoter found that CRP affected only the binding of RNAP to the promoter. In our study, we have found that at 25 °C CRP indeed increases the binding of RNAP to the lac promoter but also affects the promoter isomerization step. The effect of CRP on RNAP binding is to decrease the Kd value about 4-fold. The effect of CRP on the slowest step of isomerization is about 2-fold. However, a great deal of stabilization of the open complex occurs in the presence of CRP. A simulation with kinetic parameters suggests that these multistep changes may lead to a total 15–20-fold enhancement of promoter activity. Thus, it is possible now to account for a large part of the 40-fold activation level obtained in in vivo stimulation. Because all of our studies were conducted at 25 °C, in a strict sense the mechanism is valid at 25 °C. We are grateful to Drs.
