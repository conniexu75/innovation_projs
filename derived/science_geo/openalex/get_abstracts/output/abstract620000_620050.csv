https://openalex.org/W2885877348,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with anaemia and oral iron replacement to correct this can be problematic, intensifying inflammation and tissue damage. The intestinal microbiota also plays a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD, and iron supplementation likely influences gut bacterial diversity in patients with IBD. Here, we assessed the impact of dietary iron, using chow diets containing either 100, 200 or 400 ppm, fed ad libitum to adult female C57BL/6 mice in the presence or absence of colitis induced using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), on (i) clinical and histological severity of acute DSS-induced colitis, and (ii) faecal microbial diversity, as assessed by sequencing the V4 region of 16S rRNA. Increasing or decreasing dietary iron concentration from the standard 200 ppm exacerbated both clinical and histological severity of DSS-induced colitis. DSS-treated mice provided only half the standard levels of iron ad libitum (i.e. chow containing 100 ppm iron) lost more body weight than those receiving double the amount of standard iron (i.e. 400 ppm); p<0.01. Faecal calprotectin levels were significantly increased in the presence of colitis in those consuming 100 ppm iron at day 8 (5.94-fold) versus day-10 group (4.14-fold) (p<0.05), and for the 400 ppm day-8 group (8.17-fold) versus day-10 group (4.44-fold) (p<0.001). In the presence of colitis, dietary iron at 400 ppm resulted in a significant reduction in faecal abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and increase of Proteobacteria, changes which were not observed with lower dietary intake of iron at 100 ppm. Overall, altering dietary iron intake exacerbated DSS-induced colitis; increasing the iron content of the diet also led to changes in intestinal bacteria diversity and composition after colitis was induced with DSS."
https://openalex.org/W2896486358,"For the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, desiccation tolerance is thought to contribute significantly to the persistence of these bacteria in the healthcare environment. We investigated the ability of A. baumannii to survive rapid drying, and found that some strains exhibited a profoundly desiccation-resistant phenotype, characterized by the ability of a large proportion of cells to survive on a dry surface for an extended period of time. However, this phenotype was only displayed during the stationary phase of growth. Most interestingly, we found that drying resistance could be lost after extended cultivation in liquid medium. Genome sequencing of isolates that became drying-sensitive identified mutations in bfmR, which encodes a two-component response regulator that is important for A. baumannii virulence. Additionally, BfmR was necessary for the expression of stress-related proteins during stationary phase, and one of these, KatE, was important for long-term drying survival. These results suggested that BfmR may control stress responses, and we demonstrated that the ΔbfmR mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, nutrient starvation, and increased osmolarity. We also found that cross-protection against drying could be stimulated by either starvation, which required BfmR, or increased osmolarity. These results imply that BfmR plays a role in controlling stress responses in A. baumannii which help protect cells during desiccation, and they provide a regulatory link between this organism’s ability to persist in the environment and pathogenicity."

We collected 183 common bean accessions from 19 different Turkish geographic regions and 5 scarlet runner bean accessions to investigate their genetic diversity and population structure using phenotypic information (growth habit, and seed weight, flower color, bracteole shape and size, pod shape and leaf shape and color), geographic provenance and 12,557 silicoDArT markers. A total of 24.14% markers were found novel. For the entire population (188 accessions), the expected heterozygosity was 0.078 and overall gene diversity, Fst and Fis were 0.14, 0.55 and 1, respectively. Using marker information, model-based structure, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) algorithms clustered the 188 accessions into two main populations A (predominant) and B, and 5 unclassified genotypes, representing 3 meaningful heterotic groups for breeding purposes. Phenotypic information clearly distinguished these populations; population A and B, respectively, were bigger (>40g/100 seeds) and smaller (<40g/100 seeds) seed-sized. The unclassified population was pure and only contained climbing genotypes with 100 seed weight 2–3 times greater than populations A and B. Clustering was mainly based on A: seed weight, B: growth habit, C: geographical provinces and D: flower color. Mean kinship was generally low, but population B was more diverse than population A. Overall, a useful level of gene and genotypic diversity was observed in this work and can be used by the scientific community in breeding efforts to develop superior common bean strains."
https://openalex.org/W2950007293,"Calcium imaging is commonly used to measure the neural activity of large groups of neurons in mice. Genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) can be delivered for this purpose using non-invasive genetic methods. Compared to viral gene transfer, transgenic targeting of GECIs provides stable long-term expression and obviates the need for invasive viral injections. Transgenic mice expressing the green GECI GCaMP6 are already widely used. Here we present the generation and characterization of transgenic mice expressing the sensitive red GECI jRGECO1a, driven by the Thy1 promoter. Four transgenic lines with different expression patterns showed sufficiently high expression for cellular in vivo imaging. We used two-photon microscopy to characterize visual responses of individual neurons in the visual cortex in vivo. The signal-to-noise ratio in transgenic mice was comparable to, or better than, mice transduced with adeno-associated virus. In addition, we show that Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are useful for transcranial population imaging and functional mapping using widefield fluorescence microscopy. We also demonstrate imaging of visual responses in retinal ganglion cells in vitro. Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice are therefore a useful addition to the toolbox for imaging activity in intact neural networks."
https://openalex.org/W2896149961,"Particulate matter (PM) is emitted during the combustion of fuels and wastes. PM exposure exacerbates pulmonary diseases, and the mechanism may involve oxidative stress. At lower combustion temperatures such as occurs in the cool zone of a flame, aromatic compounds chemisorb to the surface of metal-oxide-containing PM, resulting in the formation of surface-stabilized environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFR). Prior studies showed that PM-containing EPFR redox cycle to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), and after inhalation, EPFR induce pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress. Our objective was to elucidate mechanisms linking EPFR-induced oxidant injury with increased cytokine production by pulmonary epithelial cells. We thus treated human bronchial epithelial cells with EPFR at sub-toxic doses and measured ROS and cytokine production. To assess aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity, cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter for xenobiotic response element activation. To test whether cytokine production was dependent upon AhR activation or oxidative stress, some cells were co-treated with an antioxidant or an AhR antagonist. EPFR increased IL-6 release in an ROS and AhR- and oxidant-dependent manner. Moreover, EPFR induced an AhR activation that was dependent upon oxidant production, since antioxidant co-treatment blocked AhR activation. On the other hand, EPFR treatment increased a cellular ROS production that was at least partially attenuated by AhR knockdown using siRNA. While AhR activation was correlated with an increased expression of oxidant-producing enzymes like cytochrome P450 CYP1A1, it is possible that AhR activation is both a cause and effect of EPFR-induced ROS. Finally, lipid oxidation products also induced AhR activation. ROS-dependent AhR activation may be a mechanism for altered epithelial cell responses after EPFR exposure, potentially via formation of bioactive lipid or protein oxidation products."
https://openalex.org/W2897536537,"Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) has been shown to be essential to predict disease outcome in several types of cancers. Moreover, the distribution of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+) and T cells in general (CD3+) have been used to establish an Immunoscore, as a new cancer prognosticator for survival in colon and lung cancer. In bladder cancer, immune activation has been shown to be associated with genomic subtypes of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). We sought to evaluate the prognostic impact of these immune cell types in MIBC patients treated with radical cystectomy. For this purpose, cystectomy sections (n = 67) with identifiable invasive margin were selected and stained for CD8+ and CD3+ tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); both tumor core (CT) and invasive margin (IM) were assessed. Immunoscore was calculated based on previously defined criteria and used to illustrate differences in survival. High density of CD8IM TILs was associated with better disease-free (DFS) (P = 0.01) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.02) whereas CD3IM TILs were associated with better OS (P = 0.05). Immunoscore was associated with improved DFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P = 0.05). The expression of cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) in TCGA bladder cancer was also investigated from RNA-Seq profiles of 344 cases. T cell cytotoxicity associated genes (n = 113) were derived from MSig GSEA database. Luminal (n = 121) and basal (n = 68) samples were used to evaluate expression differences. Differential expression (P<0.05) of cytotoxic T cell genes was noted across different molecular subsets of bladder cancer within TCGA analysis. Our data suggests host immune system appears to play a valuable prognostic role in MIBC."
https://openalex.org/W2952941216,"High-fat diet (HFD)-induced leaky gut syndrome combined with low-grade inflammation increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestine and may contribute to dysbiosis and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Poorly bioavailable and only partially metabolizable dietary polyphenols, such as proanthocyanidins (PACs), may exert their beneficial effects on metabolic health by scavenging intestinal ROS. To test this hypothesis, we developed and validated a novel, noninvasive, in situ method for visualizing intestinal ROS using orally administered ROS-sensitive indocyanine green (ICG) dye. C57BL/6J mice fed HFD for 10 weeks accumulated high levels of intestinal ROS compared to mice fed low-fat diet (LFD). Oral administration of poorly bioavailable grape polyphenol extract (GPE) and β-carotene decreased HFD-induced ROS in the gut to levels comparable to LFD-fed mice, while administration of more bioavailable dietary antioxidants (α-lipoic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E) did not. Forty percent of administered GPE antioxidant activity was measured in feces collected over 24 h, confirming poor bioavailability and persistence in the gut. The bloom of beneficial anaerobic gut bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, associated with improved metabolic status in rodents and humans may be directly linked to protective antioxidant activity of some dietary components. These findings suggest a possible mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of poorly bioavailable polyphenols on metabolic health."
https://openalex.org/W2896560584,"Carbon monoxide (CO) at low, non-toxic concentrations has been previously demonstrated to exert anti-inflammatory protection in murine models of sickle cell disease (SCD). However CO delivery by inhalation, CO-hemoglobin infusion or CO-releasing molecules presents problems for daily CO administration. Oral administration of a CO-saturated liquid avoids many of these issues and potentially provides a platform for self-administration to SCD patients. To test if orally-delivered CO could modulate SCD vaso-occlusion and inflammation, a liquid CO formulation (HBI-002) was administered by gavage (10 ml/kg) once-daily to NY1DD and Townes-SS transgenic mouse models of SCD. Baseline CO-hemoglobin (CO-Hb) levels were 1.6% and 1.8% in NY1DD and Townes-SS sickle mice and 0.6% in Townes-AS control mice. CO-Hb levels reached 5.4%, 4.7% and 3.0% within 5 minutes in NY1DD, SS and AS mice respectively after gavage with HBI-002. After ten treatments, each once-daily, hemoglobin levels rose from 5.3g/dL in vehicle-treated Townes-SS mice to 6.3g/dL in HBI-002-treated. Similarly, red blood cell (RBC) counts rose from 2.36 x 106/μL in vehicle-treated SS mice to 2.89 x 106/μL in HBI-002-treated mice. In concordance with these findings, hematocrits rose from 26.3% in vehicle-treated mice to 30.0% in HBI-002-treated mice. Reticulocyte counts were not significantly different between vehicle and HBI-002-treated SS mice implying less hemolysis and not an increase in RBC production. White blood cell counts decreased from 29.1 x 103/μL in vehicle-treated versus 20.3 x 103/μL in HBI-002-treated SS mice. Townes-SS mice treated with HBI-002 had markedly increased Nrf2 and HO-1 expression and decreased NF-κB activation compared to vehicle-treated mice. These anti-inflammatory effects were examined for the ability of HBI-002 (administered orally once-daily for up to 5 days) to inhibit vaso-occlusion induced by hypoxia-reoxygenation. In NY1DD and Townes-SS sickle mice, HBI-002 decreased microvascular stasis in a duration-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings support HBI-002 as a useful anti-inflammatory agent to treat SCD and warrants further development as a therapeutic."
https://openalex.org/W2895818291,"Although the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women with vast metabolic consequences, its etiology remains unknown and its diagnosis is still made by exclusion. This study aimed at characterizing a large number of urinary steroid hormone metabolites and enzyme activities in women with and without PCOS in order to test their value for diagnosing PCOS.Comparative steroid profiling of 24h urine collections using an established in-house gas-chromatography mass spectrometry method. Data were collected mostly prospectively. Patients were recruited in university hospitals in Switzerland. Participants were 41 women diagnosed with PCOS according to the current criteria of the Androgen Excess and PCOS Society Task Force and 66 healthy controls. Steroid profiles of women with PCOS were compared to healthy controls for absolute metabolite excretion and for substrate to product conversion ratios. The AUC for over 1.5 million combinations of metabolites was calculated in order to maximize the diagnostic accuracy in patients with PCOS. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were indicated for the best combinations containing 2, 3 or 4 steroid metabolites.The best single discriminating steroid was androstanediol. The best combination to diagnose PCOS contained four of the forty measured metabolites, namely androstanediol, estriol, cortisol and 20βDHcortisone with AUC 0.961 (95% CI 0.926 to 0.995), sensitivity 90.2% (95% CI 76.9 to 97.3), specificity 90.8% (95% CI 81.0 to 96.5), PPV 86.0% (95% CI 72.1 to 94.7), and NPV 93.7% (95% CI 84.5 to 98.2).PCOS shows a specific 24h urinary steroid profile, if neglected metabolites are included in the analysis and non-conventional data analysis applied. PCOS does not share a profile with hyperandrogenic forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasias due to single steroid enzyme deficiencies. Thus PCOS diagnosis by exclusion may no longer be warranted. Whether these findings also apply to spot urine and serum, remains to be tested as a next step towards routine clinical applicability."
https://openalex.org/W2896408267,"Background Plasmalogens are either phosphatidylcholine (PC P) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE P) glycerophospholipids containing a vinyl ether moiety in sn-1-position and an esterified fatty acid in sn-2 position. Multiple functions have been proposed, including reservoir of precursors for inflammatory mediators, modulation of membrane fluidity, and anti-oxidative properties. They could therefore play a role under conditions of metabolic stress. Especially enzymatically modified LDL (eLDL) and oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) represent modifications of LDL that are taken up by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to analyze plasmalogen related effects of eLDL and oxLDL in human monocyte derived macrophages, as well as the effects of HDL3 mediated deloading. Methods Elutriated monocytes from nine healthy donors were differentiated in vitro for four days. Macrophages were then loaded with native LDL, eLDL and oxLDL for 24h and subsequently deloaded with HDL3 for another 24h. Lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles were obtained. Results Loading of macrophages with eLDL and oxLDL led to a transient but strong elevation of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) most likely through direct uptake. Only eLDL induced increased levels of total PC, presumably through an induction of PC synthesis. On the other hand treatment with oxLDL led to a significant increase in PC P. Analysis of individual lipid species showed lipoprotein and saturation specific effects for LPC, PC P and PE P species. Membrane fluidity was decreased by the large amount of FC contained in the lipoproteins, as indicated by a lower PC to FC ratio after lipoprotein loading. In contrast the observed changes in the saturated to mono-unsaturated fatty acid (SFA to MUFA) and saturated to poly-unsaturated fatty acid (SFA to PUFA) ratios in PE P could represent a cellular reaction to counteract this effect by producing more fluid membranes. Transcriptomic analysis showed considerable differences between eLDL and oxLDL treated macrophages. As a common feature of both lipoproteins we detected a strong downregulation of pathways for endogenous lipid synthesis as well as for exogenous lipid uptake. Deloading with HDL3 had only minor effects on total lipid class as well as on individual lipid species levels, most of the time not reaching significance. Interestingly treatment with HDL3 had no effect on membrane fluidity under these conditions, although incubation with HDL3 was partially able to counteract the oxLDL induced transcriptomic effects. To investigate the functional effect of lipoprotein treatment on macrophage polarization we performed surface marker flow cytometry. Under our experimental conditions oxLDL was able to partially shift the surface marker pattern towards a pro-inflammatory M1-like phenotype. This is consistent with the consumption of arachidonic acid containing PE P species in oxLDL treated cells, presumably for the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. Summary Our findings provide novel data on the lipoprotein induced, lipidomic and transcriptomic changes in macrophages. This can help us better understand the development of metabolic, inflammatory diseases as well as improve our background knowledge on lipid biomarkers in serum."
https://openalex.org/W2897615089,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) encodes an enzyme that oxidizes aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids. In colorectal cancer ALDH1A1 marks cancer stem cells and plays putative roles in tumor progression and drug resistance. However, the potential value of ALDH1A1 as a diagnostic marker or target for therapy remains unclear. Here, we have analyzed ALDH1A1 mRNA and protein levels in relation to clinical, histopathological and molecular tumor features in large series of human colorectal cancer.ALDH1A1 protein levels were determined by immunohistochemistry in a series of primary colorectal tumors and their corresponding liver metastases (n = 158). ALDH1A1 mRNA levels were analyzed in several large patient cohorts of colorectal cancer. ALDH1A1 mRNA and protein levels were then related to overall survival and to clinical, histopathological and molecular tumor features.High levels of ALDH1A1 were associated with a poorly differentiated histology and a right-sided tumor location, but not to a mesenchymal-like molecular subtype. Liver metastases contained significantly higher levels of ALDH1A1 compared to the corresponding primary tumors. Radio- and/or chemotherapy prior to tumor resection was associated with increased ALDH1A1 levels regardless of the molecular subtype. Finally, ALDH1A1 protein expression in primary tumors and metastases correlated with shorter overall survival.ALDH1A1 expression is associated with features of poor prognosis, including a poorly differentiated histology and 'right-sidedness' of the primary tumor, and with shorter overall survival. ALDH1A1 is also highly expressed in therapy-surviving tumors and in liver metastases. These results warrant further research into the potential value of targeting ALDH1A1 in order to improve the efficacy of standard treatment and thereby preventing tumor recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2895836456,"Metformin, a first-line drug used to treat type 2 diabetes, has also been shown to have anticancer effects against a variety of malignancies, including colorectal cancer. Although inhibition of the mTOR pathway is known to be the most important mechanism for the antitumor effects of metformin, other mechanisms remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the antitumor mechanism of metformin in colorectal cancer using high-throughput data, and then test the mechanism experimentally. We identified the gene signature of metformin-treated colon cancer cells. This signature was processed for prediction using colon adenocarcinoma patient data from the Cancer Genome Atlas to classify the patients showing a gene expression pattern similar to that in metformin-treated cells. This patient group showed better overall and disease-free survival. Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed that the metformin-predicted group was characterized by decreased interleukin (IL)-6 pathway signaling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and colon cancer metastatic signaling. We induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cell lines via IL-6 treatment, which increased cell motility and promoted invasion. However, these effects were blocked by metformin. These findings suggest that blockade of IL-6-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition is an antitumor mechanism of metformin."
https://openalex.org/W2897079763,"Homeobox genes encode transcription factors which regulate basic processes in development and cell differentiation. Several members of the NKL subclass are deregulated in T-cell progenitors and support leukemogenesis. We have recently described particular expression patterns of nine NKL homeobox genes in early hematopoiesis and T-cell development. Here, we screened NKL homeobox gene activities in normal B-cell development and extended the NKL-code to include this lymphoid lineage. Analysis of public expression profiling datasets revealed that HHEX and NKX6-3 were the only members differentially active in naïve B-cells, germinal center B-cells, plasma cells and memory B-cells. Subsequent examination of different types of B-cell malignancies showed both aberrant overexpression of NKL-code members and ectopic activation of subclass members physiologically silent in lymphopoiesis including BARX2, DLX1, EMX2, NKX2-1, NKX2-2 and NKX3-2. Based on these findings we performed detailed studies of the B-cell specific NKL homeobox gene NKX6-3 which showed enhanced activity in patient subsets of follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and in three DLBCL cell lines to serve as in vitro models. While excluding genomic and chromosomal rearrangements at the locus of NKX6-3 (8p11) promoter studies demonstrated that B-cell factors MYB and PAX5 activated NKX6-3 transcription. Furthermore, aberrant BMP7/SMAD1-signalling and deregulated expression of chromatin complex components AUTS2 and PCGF5 promoted NKX6-3 activation. Finally, NKL homeobox genes HHEX, HLX, MSX1 and NKX6-3 were expressed in B-cell progenitors and generated a regulatory gene network in cell lines which we propose may provide physiological support for NKL-code formation in early B-cell development. Together, we identified an NKL-code in B-cell development whose violation may deregulate differentiation and promote malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2897713431,"This study investigated the effects of AdipoRon, which is an agonist for adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and AdipoR2, on the protein content, myotube diameter, and number of nuclei per myotube of C2C12 cells and skeletal muscle mass in C57BL/6J mice. AdipoRon suppressed the protein content, myotube diameter, and number of nuclei per myotube of C2C12 cells of C2C12 myotubes in a dose-dependent manner. Adiponectin-associated decline of protein content, diameter, and number of nuclei per myotube in C2C12 myotubes was partially rescued by knockdown of AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2. Phosphorylation level of AMPK showed a trend to be increased by AdipoRon. A significant increase in phosphorylation level of AMPK was observed at 20 μM AdipoRon. Knockdown of AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2 rescued AdipoRon-associated decrease in protein content of C2C12 myotubes. AdipoRon-associated increase in phosphorylation level of AMPK in C2C12 myotubes was suppressed by knockdown of AdipoR1 and/or AdipoR2. Successive intravenous injections of AdipoRon into mice caused a decrease in the wet weight of plantaris muscle (PLA), but not in soleus muscle (SOL). Mean fiber cross-sectional area of PLA, but not of SOL, was significantly decreased by AdipoRon administration. On the one hand, the expression level of phosphorylated AMPK and ubiquitinated protein in SOL and PLA muscles was upregulated by AdipoRon administration. On the other hand, AdipoRon administration induced no changes in the expression level of puromycin-labeled proteins in both SOL and PLA muscles. Expression level of adiponectin in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was increased by aging, but not in SOL muscle. Aging had no effect on the expression level of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in both muscles. Phosphorylation level of AMPK in EDL was increased by aging, but not SOL muscle. Results from this study suggest that high level of circulating adiponectin may induce skeletal muscle atrophy, especially fast-type muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2895803916,"Drought is one of the main abiotic stresses with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic impacts, especially in perennial food crops such as Prunus. There is an urgent need to identify drought resilient rootstocks that can adapt to changes in water availability. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PEG-induced water limitation stress will simulate drought conditions and drought-related genes, including transcription factors (TFs), will be differentially expressed in response to this stress. 'Garnem' genotype, an almond × peach hybrid [P. amygdalus Batsch, syn P. dulcis (Mill.) x P. persica (L.) Batsch] was exposed to PEG-6000 solution, and a time-course transcriptome analysis of drought-stressed roots was performed at 0, 2 and 24 h time points post-stress. Transcriptome analysis resulted in the identification of 12,693 unique differentially expressed contigs (DECs) at the 2 h time point, and 7,705 unique DECs at the 24 h time point after initiation of the drought treatment. Interestingly, three drought-induced genes, directly related to water use efficiency (WUE) namely, ERF023 TF; LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-kinase ERECTA; and NF-YB3 TF, were found induced under stress. The RNAseq results were validated with quantitative RT-PCR analysis of eighteen randomly selected differentially expressed contigs (DECs). Pathway analysis in the present study provides valuable information regarding metabolic events that occur during stress-induced signalling in 'Garnem' roots. This information is expected to be useful in understanding the potential mechanisms underlying drought stress responses and drought adaptation strategies in Prunus species."
https://openalex.org/W2897416652,"Successful disinfection alongside complete endodontic tissue regeneration and revascularization are the most desired clinical outcomes of regenerative endodontics. Despite reported clinical successes, significant limitations to the current regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) have been elucidated. To improve the current REP, an antibiotics and nitric oxide (NO) releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel was developed. The study evaluates antibacterial effects of an antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel on multispecies endodontic bacteria. Antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (CF) and metronidazole (MN) were mixed and encapsulated within the NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel. The gel was synthesized and self-assembled from peptide amphiphiles containing various functional groups. Antibacterial effects of the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel were evaluated using bacterial viability assays involving endodontic microorganisms including clinical samples. Pulp-dentin regeneration was evaluated via animal-model experiments. The antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel demonstrated a concentration dependent antibacterial effect. In addition, NO alone demonstrated a concentration dependent antibacterial effect on endodontic microorganism. An in vivo analysis demonstrated the antibiotics and NO releasing biomimetic nanomatrix gel promoted tooth revascularization with maturation of root canals. An optimal concentration of and NO releasing nanomatrix gel is suggested for its potential as a root treatment material for REP and an appropriate protocol for human trials. Further investigation is required to obtain a larger sample size and decide upon ideal growth factor incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W2896061359,"Chikungunya is a reemerging vector borne pathogen associated with severe morbidity in affected populations. Lamu, along the Kenyan coast was affected by a major chikungunya outbreak in 2004. Twelve years later, we report on entomologic investigations and laboratory confirmed chikungunya cases in northeastern Kenya. Patient blood samples were received at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) viral hemorrhagic fever laboratory and the immunoglobulin M enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (IgM ELISA) was used to test for the presence of IgM antibodies against chikungunya and dengue. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) utilizing flavivirus, alphavirus and chikungunya specific primers were used to detect acute infections and representative PCR positive samples sequenced to confirm the circulating strain. Immature mosquitoes were collected from water-holding containers indoors and outdoors in the affected areas in northeastern Kenya. A total of 189 human samples were tested; 126 from Kenya and 63 from Somalia. 52.9% (100/189) tested positive for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) by either IgM ELISA or RT-PCR. Sequence analysis of selected samples revealed that the virus was closely related to that from China (2010). 29% (55/189) of the samples, almost all from northeastern Kenya or with a history of travel to northern Kenya, tested positive for dengue IgM antibodies. Entomologic risk assessment revealed high house, container and Breteau indices of, 14.5, 41.9 and 17.1% respectively. Underground water storage tanks were the most abundant, 30.1%, of which 77.4% were infested with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. These findings confirm the presence of active chikungunya infections in the northeastern parts of Kenya. The detection of dengue IgM antibodies concurrently with chikungunya virus circulation emphasizes on the need for improved surveillance systems and diagnostic algorithms with the capacity to capture multiple causes of arbovirus infections as these two viruses share common vectors and eco-systems. In addition sustained entomological surveillance and vector control programs targeting most productive containers are needed to monitor changes in vector densities, for early detection of the viruses and initiate vector control efforts to prevent possible outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2897588667,"Adolescent girls have a higher risk of anemia due to an increased requirement, low intake of hematopoietic nutrients and low intake of a nutrient that enhance absorption of these hematopoietic nutrients. Adolescent girls living in refugee camps are more vulnerable to anemia. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia and associated factors among adolescent girls aged 10-19 years in Aw-Barre refugee camp, Somalia regional state, Southeast Ethiopia.A cross-sectional study design was employed. Study participants were recruited using a simple random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Hemoglobin level was tested using HemoCueHb 301 from 10μl finger prick blood samples. Adolescents with a hemoglobin level of <12.5gm/dl after altitude adjustment were classified as anemic. Data were entered using Epi Info version 7.0 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the association of independent variables with anemia. Variables having P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Four hundred thirty-seven adolescent girls participated in the study with a response rate of 95.83%. The prevalence of anemia was 22% (95% CI (17.6, 26.1)). Late adolescents were 2 times more likely to have anemia as compared to early adolescents (AOR: 1.95, 95% CI (1.09, 3.47). Those who stayed ≥8 years in the camp were 3 times more likely to develop anemia (AOR: 2.92, 95% CI (1.14, 7.50)). Those who ate heme iron food sources less than one time per month were 11 times more likely to develop anemia compared to those who ate more than twice within a week (AOR: 11.42, 95% CI (3.42, 38.18)).The prevalence of anemia among adolescent girls was a moderate public health problem. Education and awareness on adolescent nutrition with special attention of late adolescents and duration in the refugee camps is warranted. Moreover, promoting the intake of foods rich in heme iron is suggested."

Activator [e.g., epidermal growth factor (EGF)] or inhibitors (e.g., wortmannin and U0126) are added to modulate kinases in oocytes during meiosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of kinase modulation on nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation in COCs. Class I COCs showed a significantly higher developmental competence than class II COCs. Moreover, the expression of two kinases, AKT and ERK, differed between class I and class II COCs during in vitro maturation (IVM). Initially, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in class I COCs during early IVM (0-22 h) decreased developmental parameters, such as blastocyst formation rate, blastomere number, and cell survival. Conversely, EGF-mediated AKT activation in class II COCs enhanced developmental capacity. Regarding the MAPK signaling pathway, inhibition of ERK by U0126 in class II COCs during early IVM impaired developmental competence. However, transient treatment with U0126 in class II COCs increased oocyte maturation and AKT activity, improving embryonic development. Additionally, western blotting showed that inhibition of ERK activity negatively regulated the AKT signaling pathway, indicative of a relationship between AKT and MAPK signaling in the process underlying meiotic progression in pigs. These findings may help increase the developmental competence and utilization rate of pig COCs with regard to the production of transgenic pigs and improve our understanding of kinase-associated meiosis events."

In this study, their antennal morphology, types of sensilla, and distributions were observed by using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope). Nine types of sensilla were found on the antennae of C. punctiferalis, while eight types of sensilla were presented on each of G. molesta and S. albicana. The sensilla trichodea with two subtypes were the most abundant sensilla among three fruit borers. Two subtypes of sensillum coeloconica (type I with spines and type II without spines) were observed on the antennae of C. punctiferalis and G. molesta. However, sensilla coeloconica (type I) were only found in S. albicana. Although the sensilla campaniformia were only found on the antennae of C. punctiferalis, our observations confirm sensilla campaniformia presence in the moths. In addition, the functions of these sensilla were discussed based on previously reported lepidopteran insects. As a result, our study may provide useful information for advanced electrophysiological and behavioral experiments to better understand the mechanisms related to pests control."
https://openalex.org/W2897191585,"Shelf life is the time a product can be stored without losing its qualitative characteristics. It represents one of the most critical quality traits for food products, particularly for fleshy fruits, including tomatoes. Tomatoes’ shelf life is usually shortened due to fast over-ripening caused by several different factors, among which changes in temperature, respiration and pathogen exposure. Although tomatoes usually do not contain anthocyanins, varieties enriched in these antioxidant compounds have been recently developed. The anthocyanin-rich tomatoes have been shown to possess a significantly extended shelf life by delayed over-ripening and reduction of the susceptibility to certain pathogens. In the present work, we compared different conditions of postharvest storage of anthocyanin-rich tomato fruits with the aim to understand if the added value represented by the presence of the anthocyanins in the fruit peel can be affected in postharvest. For this purpose we used an anthocyanin-enriched tomato line derived from conventional breeding and took into consideration different light and temperature conditions, known to affect fruit physiology during postharvest as well as anthocyanin production. Several quality traits related to the fruit ripening were measured, including anthocyanin and carotenoid content, pH, titratable acidity and total soluble solids. In this way we identified that the most suitable fruit storage and postharvest anthocyanin accumulation were obtained through exposure to cool temperature (12° C), particularly in the presence of light. Under these parameters, tomato fruits showed increased anthocyanin content and unchanged flavour-related features up to three weeks after harvesting."
https://openalex.org/W2897629973,"Background A characteristic pathology of early onset myasthenia gravis is thymic hyperplasia with ectopic germinal centers (GC). However, the mechanisms that trigger and maintain thymic hyperplasia are poorly characterized. Dysregulation of small, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes has been identified in the pathology of several autoimmune diseases. We assessed the miRNA and mRNA profiles of the MG thymus and have investigated their role in GC formation and maintenance. Methods MG thymus samples were assessed by histology and grouped based upon the appearance of GC; GC positive and GC negative. A systems biology approach was used to study the differences between the groups. Our study included miRNA and mRNA profiling, quantitative real-time PCR validation, miRNA target identification, pathway analysis, miRNA-mRNA reciprocal expression pairing and interaction. Results Thirty-eight mature miRNAs and forty-six annotated mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed between the two groups (>1.5 fold change, ANOVA p<0.05). The miRNAs were found to be involved in immune response pathways and identified in other autoimmune diseases. The cellular and molecular functions of the mRNAs showed involvement in cell death and cell survival, cellular proliferation, cytokine signaling and extra-cellular matrix reorganization. Eleven miRNA and mRNA pairs were reciprocally regulated. The Regulator of G protein Signalling 13 (RGS13), known to be involved in GC regulation, was identified in specimens with GC and was paired with downregulation of miR-452-5p and miR-139-5p. MiRNA target sites were validated by dual luciferase assay. Transfection of miRNA mimics led to down regulation of RGS13 expression in Raji cells. Conclusion Our study indicates a distinct miRNA and mRNA expression pattern in ectopic GC in MG thymus. These miRNAs and mRNAs are involved in regulatory pathways common to inflammation and immune response, cell cycle regulation and anti-apoptotic pathways suggesting their involvement in support of GC formation in the thymus. We demonstrate for the first time that miR-139-5p and miR-452-5p negatively regulate RGS13 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2895825365,"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with moderate hypothermic cardiac arrest (MHCA) is essential for prolonged complex procedures in cardiac surgery and is associated with postoperative complications. Although cytokine release provoked through MHCA under CPB plays a pivotal role in postoperative organ damage, the pathomechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated the cytokine release pattern and histological organ damage after MHCA using a recently described mouse CPB model. Eight BALB/c mice underwent 60 minutes of circulatory arrest under CPB, were successively rewarmed and reperfused. Blood cytokine concentrations and liver and kidney function parameters were measured and histological changes to these organs were compared to control animals. Our results showed a marked increase in proinflammatory cytokines and histological changes in the kidney, lung, and liver after CPB. Furthermore, clinical chemistry showed signs of hemolysis and acute kidney injury. These results suggest early onset of solid organ injury which correlates with increased leukocyte infiltration. A better understanding of the interplay between pro-inflammatory cytokine activation and solid organ injury in this model of CBP with MHCA will inform strategies to reduce organ damage during cardiac surgeries in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2895850748,"The purpose of this study was to assess the overall clinical results and range of motion (ROM) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with preoperative stiffness. We also aimed to determine whether the severity or cause of the stiffness can affect the clinical outcome after surgery. This retrospective study included 122 knees (117 patients) with follow-up of more than 2 years (mean age, 64.3 years). TKA was performed using posterior-stabilized, varus-valgus constrained (VVC), and hinged prostheses. To determine the effect of the severity of stiffness on the clinical outcome, the subjects were divided into two groups: the severe group (preoperative ROM ≤ 50°; 18 knees) and the moderate group (preoperative ROM, 50°–90°; 104 knees). Then, clinical results and ROM were compared according to the severity or cause of preoperative stiffness. After surgery, preoperative ROM (mean, 78°; range, 25°- 90°) was improved (mean, 107°; range, 70°- 130°). The severe group more frequently used the VVC or hinged prostheses (72% vs. 18%). Furthermore, the severe group had worse knee and function scores as well as more complications (33% vs. 13%), even though the severe group had a greater ROM increment (47° vs. 27°) after surgery. Patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis showed better ROM and clinical results compared to patients with infectious or traumatic arthritis. Although TKA in stiff knees can be successful, the results are inferior in knees with severe stiffness and knees with infectious or traumatic arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2897617307,"Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative therapy for surgically high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Although TAVI improves survival of patients with severe AS, the mechanism of this effect remains to be clarified. We investigated the effects of TAVI on left ventricular (LV) function and identified the predictive parameters for cardiac events after TAVI.We studied 128 patients with severe symptomatic AS who underwent TAVI. Echocardiographic assessments were performed before and after TAVI. In addition to the conventional echocardiographic parameters such as LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and LV mass index (LVMI), the LV global longitudinal strain (GLS) and early diastolic peak strain rate (SR_E) using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography were also evaluated. All patients were assessed for clinical events including major adverse cardiac events and stroke according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. GLS, early diastolic peak velocity (e'), aortic regurgitation (AR) severity, and SR_E were significantly improved after TAVI. Thirteen patients had an event during the observational period of 591 days (median). Patients with events had higher LVMI, more severe AR, and worse GLS compared to those without events. Furthermore, receiver-operating curve analysis revealed that GLS was the strongest predictor for clinical events (p = 0.009; area under the curve, 0.73).Preoperative LV geometric deformation and dysfunction, as a consequence of the cumulative burden of pressure overload, improved after TAVI and could predict cardiac events after TAVI."
https://openalex.org/W2897820051,"The anterior cruciate ligament rupture is one of the most common sport injuries. Due to ligaments’ poor healing capacity, surgical intervention is often required. Nowadays, these injuries are managed using replacement autografts or to a lesser extent using artificial ligaments. With the expansion of tissue engineering, more recent researches focus on the development of biodegradable structures that could allow graft functioning while enhancing host integration. The main challenge is to develop a structure that gradually loses its mechanical properties when at the same time the neo-ligament gains in solidity. Mechanical behavior and reconstruction of natural tissue are the two key points for such a successful device. This article evaluates the mechanical consistency of poly(ε-caprolactone) fibers bundles grafted with sodium polystyrene sulfonate, as a candidate for ligament prosthesis. In order to be medically used, PCL fibers need to cope with multiple steps before implantation including extensive washings, knitting, grafting and sterilization processes. The evolution of mechanical properties at each step of the elaboration process has been investigated. The results show that PCL bundles have the same visco-elastic behavior than the native ACL. Nevertheless, when undergoing physical treatments such as ionizing radiations, like UV or β-rays, the material endures a hardening, increasing its stiffness but also its fragility. At this opposite, the thermal radical grafting acts like an annealing step, increasing significantly the elasticity of the PCL fibers. With this chemical treatment, the stiffness is decreasing, leading to higher energy dissipation. Added to the observation of the structure of the material, this demonstrates the possibility of the PCL to modulate it microstructure. In case of orthopedic prosthesis, the need of such a construct is strongly required to avoid distension of the future prosthesis and to restore good knee stabilization, showing the promising future of PCL ligament prosthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2895822473,"Haliotis discus hannai, a species of Pacific abalone, is a highly valuable food source throughout Northeast Asia. As H. discus hannai primarily feed on brown algae and largely extract their energy from algal polysaccharides, understanding the mechanisms by which they digest algal polysaccharides is essential for elucidating their energy metabolism. Gut microbes, as well as the host animal, are involved in the process of polysaccharide degradation. To identify algal polysaccharide-digestion mechanisms and their origin, we analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of abalone visceral extracts. Microbial communities were characterized using the 16S rRNA gene sequences in the metagenome and our results differed significantly from those of previous studies using traditional microbiological methods such as bacterial cultivation and cloning. A greater diversity of bacterial taxa was identified here than was previously identified using cultivation methods. Furthermore, the most abundant bacterial taxa also differed from previous studies, which is not common when comparing the results of bacterial culturing with those of molecular methodologies. Based on the metatranscriptome, overall functions were identified and additional analyses were performed on the coding sequences of algal polysaccharide-digestive enzymes, including alginate lyase. Results of the transcriptomic analyses suggest that alginate lyase in the visceral extracts of H. discus hannai was produced by the host itself, not by visceral bacteria. This is the first next-generation sequencing study performed on abalone to characterize the visceral microbiota and the source of the ability to digest algal polysaccharides by analyzing the metagenome and metatranscriptome together."
https://openalex.org/W2896466518,"In this study, phenotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data of 272 accessions of two-rowed spring barley from the USA along with 94 accessions from Kazakhstan were assessed in field trials at six breeding organizations in Kazakhstan to evaluate the performance of the USA samples over three years (2009–2011). The average grain yield over the six locations was not significantly higher in Kazakh accessions in comparison to the USA samples. Twenty four samples from Montana, Washington, the USDA station in Aberdeen Idaho, and the Anheuser-Busch breeding programs showed heavier average yield than the local standard cultivar “Ubagan”. Principal Coordinate analysis based on two sets of SNP data suggested that Kazakh accessions were closest to the USA accessions among eight groups of samples from different parts of the World, and within five US barley origin groups the samples from Montana and Washington perfectly matched six groups of Kazakh breeding origins. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using data from eighteen field trials allowed the identification of ninety one marker-trait associations (MTA) in two or more environments for nine traits, including key characters such as heading time (HT), number of kernels per spike (NKS), and thousand grain weight (TGW). Our GWAS allowed the identification of eight MTA for HT and NKS, and sixteen MTA for TGW, when those MTA were linked to mapped SNPs. Based on comparisons of chromosomal positions of MTA identified in this study, and positions of known genes and quantitative trait loci for HT, NKS and TGW, it was suggested that MTA for HT on chromosome 2H (at 158.2 cM, 11_21414), MTA for NKS on 5H (at 118.6 cM, 11_20298), and two MTA for TGW on chromosome 4H (at 94.7 cM, 12_30718, and at 129.3 cM, 11_20013) were potentially new associations in barley. GWAS suggested that six MTA for HT, including two on chromosome 1H, two on chromosome 3H, and one each on chromosomes 4H and 6H, had useful pleiotropic effects for improving barley spike traits."

This need is particularly evident in areas greatly affected by anthropogenic disturbances such as the Eastern Mediterranean and its freshwater environments. To improve our knowledge of Eastern Mediterranean freshwater fishes, we phylogenetically studied Western Palearctic Cobitis species, focusing on those found in Turkey. Overall, our results provide a robust framework to assess the number of species of Cobitis. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial (cyt b) and nuclear (RAG1) sequences show seven major clades (Clades 1–7) grouping all Western Palearctic Cobitis species, except C. melanoleuca. In general, each major clade comprises Cobitis species that inhabit geographically close areas and have similar secondary sexual characters. Multiple divergent lineages were identified in our analyses, some of which were highly divergent such as the ones inhabiting Turkish freshwaters. Moreover, in some analyses, several of the identified lineages were incongruent with a priori defined species. Furthermore, our analyses identified eight potentially new candidate species, six that had been suggested in previous studies and two that are reported here for the first time. Our results reveal Turkey as the area with the greatest diversity of spined loaches in the Mediterranean."

In this study, we describe the antimicrobial activity of an anionic CSαβ fungal defensin from Aspergillus fumigatus, AfusinC. AfusinC was recombinantly produced as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The tag was removed by proteolytic cleavage, and AfusinC was purified by size exclusion chromatography. About 0.8 mg of recombinant AfusinC was obtained from 1 L of culture.

https://openalex.org/W2897852813,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from glaciers has an important role in the biogeochemistry of glacial ecosystems. This study focuses on DOC from glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers are experiencing rapid shrinkage. We found that concentrations of DOC in snowpits (0.16±0.054 μg g−1), aged snow (0.16±0.048 μg g−1), and bare ice (0.18±0.082 μg g−1) were similar across the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, but were slightly lower than those in other glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Vertical variations of DOC, particulate organic carbon, black carbon, and total nitrate in snowpit showed no systematic variations in the studied glaciers, with high values of DOC occurring in the ice or dusty layers. We estimated the export of DOC and particulate organic carbon from glaciers to be 1.96±0.66 Gg yr–1 and 5.88±2.15 Gg yr–1 in this region, respectively, indicating that organic carbon released from glacier meltwater may be affecting downstream ecosystems. Potential sources of the air masses arriving at the southeastern Tibetan glaciers include South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, and northwest China. Emissions from biomass burning of South Asia played an important role in the deposition of DOC to the glacier, which can be evidenced by backward trajectories and fire spot distributions from MODIS and CALIPSO images. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosols contribute abundant DOC to glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The pronounced rate of glacial melting in the region may be delivering increased quantities of relic DOC to downstream rivers."

A total of 181 obese children (study group) aged 4-18 years old were prospectively enrolled and compared with 229 healthy subjects (control group). We acquired demographic, clinical, biochemical, and 2D echocardiography/Doppler data. Also, RT3DE and 3DSTE were performed to measure LV volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV mass (LVM), LV peak systolic global longitudinal strain (GLS), radial strain (GRS), circumferential strain (GCS), and global strain (GS). There were significant differences in anthropometric measurements, blood pressures, Cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), Intima-media thickness (IMT), left atrium end-systolic dimension (LASD), interventricular septal end-diastolic dimension (IVSD), LV posterior wall end-diastolic dimension (LVPWD), LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD), LV end-diastolic volumes (LVEDV), and LV end-systolic volumes (LVESV), E and A velocities, E/A,e', e'/a', E/e', LVM, LV mass index (LVMI), GLS, GRS, GCS, and GS between the study and control groups. The receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) for the statistically significant echocardiographic variables showed that the range of areas of ROC curves varied from 0.76 (GLS), 0.74 (GRS), 0.72 (LASD), to 0.58 (LVESD), respectively. In conclusion, LV 3D strain variables by RT3DE and 3DSTE decrease in obese children. LV 3D strain is more sensitive than other echocardiographic and vascular ultrasound variables in detecting cardiovascular changes in children with obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2897137406,"Objective Hypothyroidism has been suggested to be an uncommon cause of hyponatremia. However, little is known about the prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with different levels of hyponatremia. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of hypothyroidism among patients with hyponatremia of varying severity while taking into consideration potential confounders associated with thyroid function. Methods All data on thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), and serum sodium (Na) levels were retrospectively collected from medical records at two Japanese tertiary hospitals. The main outcome measure was overt hypothyroidism, defined as TSH > 10.0 μIU/mL and free T4 < 1.01 ng/dL. Results Of 71,817 patients, 964 patients (1.3%) had overt hypothyroidism. The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism in each category of hyponatremia (Na ≥136, 130–135, and ≤129 mEq/L) was 1.2% (787/65,051), 2.4% (124/5,254) and 3.5% (53/1,512), respectively. A significant increase in prevalence was observed as the severity of hyponatremia increased (P < 0.001 for trend). Multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, kidney function, and serum albumin level showed that the odds ratios for overt hypothyroidism increased with increasing severity of hyponatremia when compared with Na ≥ 136 mEq/L (130–135 mEq/L: 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.78, P = 0.001; ≤129 mEq/L: 1.87, 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.63, P < 0.001; P< 0.001 for trend). Conclusion The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism was significantly higher as the severity of hyponatremia progressed, even after adjusting for potential confounders. Hypothyroidism should be differentiated in patients with hyponatremia."

The general research concept assumed the use of a substrate that, in the presence of a particular enzyme, will quickly undergo conversion to a coloured product. ortho-Nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) was used as the immobilized substrate and β-galactosidase from Kluyveromyces lactis as the biocatalyst to be determined. Among other factors, the range of detectable concentrations of galactosidase, the operational pH range, the time necessary to achieve a visible response and the preferred storage conditions for the test were determined. As a result, an effective colourimetric test for β-galactosidase detection was obtained. Its main advantages include (i) the effective detection of the enzyme at concentrations greater than or equal to 0.6 mg.L-1, (ii) the ability to perform initial quantification of the enzyme on the basis of the intensity of the obtained colour (iii) applicability in a wide pH range (from 4.0 to 9.0), (iv) a relatively short response time (from 1 to a maximum of 30 minutes) and (v) stability in long-term storage at 4°C (90 days without loss of specific properties)."
https://openalex.org/W2896150891,"Cultured splenic stroma has been shown to support in vitro hematopoiesis in overlaid bone marrow and spleen progenitors. These co-cultures support longterm production of a novel dendritic-like cell type along with transient production of myeloid cells. They also maintain a progenitor cell population. The splenic stromal lines 5G3 and 3B5 have been identified as a supporter and a non-supporter of hematopoiesis. Based on their gene expression profile, both 5G3 and 3B5 express genes related to hematopoiesis, while 5G3 cells express several unique genes, and show upregulation of some genes over 3B5. Based on gene expression studies, specific inhibitors were tested for capacity to inhibit hematopoiesis in co-cultures. Addition of specific antibodies and small molecule inhibitors identified VCAM1, CXCL12, CSF1 and SPP1 as potential regulators of hematopoiesis, although both are expressed by 5G3 and 3B5. Through inhibition of function, SVEP1 and ALDH1 are also shown here to be deterministic of 5G3 hematopoietic support capacity, since these are uniquely expressed by 5G3 and not 3B5. The achievement of inhibition is notable given the dynamic, longterm nature of co-cultures which involve only small numbers of cells. The alternate plan, to add recombinant soluble factors produced by 5G3 back into 3B5 co-cultures in order to recover in vitro hematopoiesis, proved ineffective. Out of 6 different factors added to 3B5, only IGF2 showed any effect on cell production. The identification of differentially expressed or upregulated genes in 5G3 has provided an insight into potential pathways involved in in vitro hematopoiesis leading to production of dendritic-like cells."

Our main aim is to assess the association of 8 TRKB genetic polymorphisms and SA in depressed patients.In 624 patients currently experiencing an MDE in the context of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (METADAP study), we assessed the association between 8 TRKB genetic polymorphisms (rs1778933, rs1187352, rs2289658, rs2289657, rs2289656, rs3824519, rs56142442 and rs1439050) and acute (previous month) or past (older than one month) SA. Bonferroni corrections and multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, level of education, marital status, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score and previous MDE were used.The rs2289656 was associated with acute SA (CC = 28.5%, CT = 15.0% and TT = 11.5%, p = 0.0008). However, the other SNPs were not. Patients with the CC genotype had a higher rate of acute SA (28.5%) as compared to T carriers (14.6%) (adjusted OR = 2.2, CI95% [1.4; 3.5], p<0.0001).The TRKB rs2289656 CC genotype is associated with a 2.2 fold higher risk of acute SA in depressed patients. If this result could be confirmed, this TRKB SNP may be assessed to contribute to the prediction of SA in depressed patients."
https://openalex.org/W2896683757,"Spaceflight negatively affects sensorimotor behavior; exercise mitigates some of these effects. Head down tilt bed rest (HDBR) induces body unloading and fluid shifts, and is often used to investigate spaceflight effects. Here, we examined whether exercise mitigates effects of 70 days HDBR on the brain and if fitness and brain changes with HDBR are related.HDBR subjects were randomized to no-exercise (n = 5) or traditional aerobic and resistance exercise (n = 5). Additionally, a flywheel exercise group was included (n = 8). Exercise protocols for exercise groups were similar in intensity, therefore these groups were pooled in statistical analyses. Pre and post-HDBR MRI (structure and structural/functional connectivity) and physical fitness measures (lower body strength, muscle cross sectional area, VO2 max, body composition) were collected. Voxel-wise permutation analyses were used to test group differences in brain changes, and their associations with fitness changes.Comparisons of exercisers to controls revealed that exercise led to smaller fitness deterioration with HDBR but did not affect brain volume or connectivity. Group comparisons showed that exercise modulated post-HDBR recovery of brain connectivity in somatosensory regions. Posthoc analysis showed that this was related to functional connectivity decrease with HDBR in non-exercisers but not in exercisers. Correlational analyses between fitness and brain changes showed that fitness decreases were associated with functional connectivity and volumetric increases (all r >.74), potentially reflecting compensation. Modest brain changes or even decreases in connectivity and volume were observed in subjects who maintained or showed small fitness gains. These results did not survive Bonferroni correction, but can be considered meaningful because of the large effect sizes.Exercise performed during HDBR mitigates declines in fitness and strength. Associations between fitness and brain connectivity and volume changes, although unadjusted for multiple comparisons in this small sample, suggest that supine exercise reduces compensatory HDBR-induced brain changes."

https://openalex.org/W2897156646,"Natural nest sites are important breeding resource in terms of population dynamics, especially in forest systems where nest trees limit populations or timber harvesting destroys nests. Nest structures usually have a long life and can be reused by breeding pairs across multiple breeding seasons, so studying their dynamics is of relevance for biodiversity conservation. In this study, we develop a dynamic model to evaluate nest site availability and its influence on the breeding settlement of a forest raptor community composed of booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) in a Mediterranean forest ecosystem in southeast Spain. This model approach is also applied to analyse the influence of forestry practices on the dynamics of occupied nests for a simulated period (2010–2050). The simulated scenarios include unmanaged forest and timber harvesting practices of clearcuttings every ten years considering two factors: the age class of trees for clearcutting (40, 50, 60 and 70 years old) and the type of forest management (with or without nest protection). Our simulated results show that the number of breeding pairs is constant during the period without timber harvest, whereas breeding pairs gradually decrease in the scenario of clearcutting trees aged from 70 to 50-years without nest protection, and populations become extinct with the clearcutting of 40-year old trees. Considering the practice of clearcutting and nest protection, nest occupancy can reach the maximum number of occupied nests for the scenarios of cutting 70 and 60-year old trees, and maintain populations without extinction for the scenarios of cutting 40-year old trees. We conclude that nest sites (whether occupied or not) are key resources for increasing the occupancy of the forest raptor community and that nest protection measures buffer the effects of clearcuttings, thus preventing population extinction."

Here we described a new transgene expression system based exclusively on endogenous transcription activities and a minimum set of regulatory components that can easily been adapted to different strains. The pTbFIX vectors are designed to contain the sequence of interest under the control of an inducible rRNA promoter along with a constitutive dicistronic unit encoding a nucleus targeted tetracycline repressor and puromycin resistance genes in a tandem “head-to-tail” configuration. Upon doxycycline induction, the system supports regulatable GFP expression (170 to 400 fold) in both bloodstream and procyclic T. brucei forms. Furthermore we have adapted the pTbFIX plasmid to perform RNAi experimentation. Lethal phenotypes, including α-tubulin and those corresponding to the enolase and clathrin heavy chain genes, were successfully recapitulated in procyclic and bloodstream parasites thus showing the versatility of this new tool."
https://openalex.org/W2895865051,"Additional degrees of freedom existed in dual-motor coupling system bring considerable challenge to the optimal control of electric vehicles. Moreover, the stochastic characteristic of vehicle mass can further increase this challenge. A receding horizon control (RHC) strategy in consideration of stochastic vehicle mass is proposed in this study to respond to this challenge. Aiming at an electric vehicle with dual-motor coupling, a Markov chain is firstly deployed to predict future driving conditions by a formulated state transition probability matrix, based on historical driving cycles in real-world. Then, future required power is predicted by the predicted driving conditions, stochastic vehicle mass and road gradient, where the stochastic vehicle mass is formulated as stochastic variables in different bus stops. Finally, dynamic programming is employed to calculate the optimal vector of the vehicle within the defined prediction horizon, and only the first control values extracted from the optimal control vector are used to execute real-time power distribution control. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy is reasonable and can at least reduce electric consumption by 4.64%, compared with rule-based strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2896508605,"Though circulating antioxidant capacity in plasma is homeostatically regulated, it is not known whether acute stressors (i.e. trauma) affecting different anatomical locations could have quantitatively different impacts. For this reason, we evaluated the relationship between the anatomical location of trauma and plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in a prospective study, where the anatomical locations of trauma in polytraumatic patients (n = 66) were categorized as primary affecting the brain -traumatic brain injury (TBI)-, thorax, abdomen and pelvis or extremities. We measured the following: plasma TAC by 2 independent methods, the contribution of selected antioxidant molecules (uric acid, bilirubin and albumin) to these values and changes after 1 week of progression. Surprisingly, TBI lowered TAC (919 ± 335 μM Trolox equivalents (TE)) in comparison with other groups (thoracic trauma 1187 ± 270 μM TE; extremities 1025 ± 276 μM TE; p = 0.004). The latter 2 presented higher hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 272 ± 87 mmHg) and hemodynamic instability (inotrope use required in 54.5%) as well. Temporal changes in TAC are also dependent on anatomical location, as thoracic and extremity trauma patients' TAC values decreased (1187 ± 270 to 1045 ± 263 μM TE; 1025 ± 276 to 918 ± 331 μM TE) after 1 week (p < 0.01), while in TBI these values increased (919 ± 335 to 961 ± 465 μM TE). Our results show that the response of plasma antioxidant capacity in trauma patients is strongly dependent on time after trauma and location, with TBI failing to induce such a response."
https://openalex.org/W2896558919,"Liver injury can occur during antiviral therapies with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), potentially necessitating discontinuation of the therapies, with consequent worsening of the sustained viral response (SVR) rates, in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). To clarify the mechanisms involved in serum transaminase level elevation, we performed a retrospective evaluation of the serum concentrations of daclatasvir and asunaprevir, both classified as DAAs, in patients receiving treatment with a combination of the two drugs.Subjects were 278 Japanese patients with genotype-1b HCV who received daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy for more than 4 weeks. Serum concentrations of both the DAAs were measured at 4 weeks after the initiation of therapy.Liver injuries including serum AST and/or ALT level elevation to 150 U/L or over were found in 34 patients (12.2%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified serum asunaprevir concentrations as being significantly associated with developing liver injury, with an odds ratio of 1.046 (95% confidence interval 1.011-1.082, p<0.05). Serum asunaprevir concentrations showed correlation with the extent of liver fibrosis, estimated by peripheral platelets counts and serum albumin levels and baseline and FIB4 index and serum Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) levels at 4 weeks of the therapy; the concentrations were significantly higher among patients showing 3.0 or more of M2BPGi levels than among those with the levels less than 3.0; on the other hand, no such correlation/difference was found in serum daclatasvir concentrations.High serum concentrations of serum asunaprevir, which were associated with the extent of liver fibrosis, appear to provoke the occurrence of liver injury in patients with genotype-1b HCV receiving combined daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2897060419,"In resource-limited settings holding regimens, such as lamivudine monotherapy (LM), are used to manage HIV-positive children failing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) to mitigate the risk of drug resistance developing, whilst adherence barriers are addressed or when access to second- or third-line regimens is restricted. We aimed to investigate characteristics of children placed on LM and their outcomes.We describe the characteristics of children (age <16 years at cART start) from 5 IeDEA-SA cohorts with a record of LM during their treatment history. Among those on LM for >90 days we describe their immunologic outcomes on LM and their immunologic and virologic outcomes after resuming cART.We included 228 children in our study. At LM start their median age was 12.0 years (IQR 7.3-14.6), duration on cART was 3.6 years (IQR 2.0-5.9) and median CD4 count was 605.5 cells/μL (IQR 427-901). Whilst 110 (48%) had no prior protease inhibitor (PI)-exposure, of the 69 with recorded PI-exposure, 9 (13%) patients had documented resistance to all PIs. After 6 months on LM, 70% (94/135) experienced a drop in CD4, with a predicted average CD4 decline of 46.5 cells/μL (95% CI 37.7-55.4). Whilst on LM, 46% experienced a drop in CD4 to <500 cells/μL, 18 (8%) experienced WHO stage 3 or 4 events, and 3 children died. On resumption of cART the average gain in CD4 was 15.65 cells/uL per month and 66.6% (95% CI 59.3-73.7) achieved viral suppression (viral load <1000) at 6 months after resuming cART.Most patients experienced immune decline on LM. Its use should be avoided in those with low CD4 counts, but restricted use may be necessary when treatment options are limited. Managing children with virologic failure will continue to be challenging until more treatment options and better adherence strategies are available."
https://openalex.org/W2896629566,"Functional MRI (fMRI) is a well-established method used to investigate localised brain activation by virtue of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect. It often relies on visual presentations using beam projectors, liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, and goggle systems. In this study, we designed an MR compatible, low-cost display unit based on organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) and demonstrated its performance.A 3.8"" dual OLED module and an MIPI-to-HDMI converter board were used. The OLED module was enclosed using a shielded box to prevent noise emission from the display module and the potentially destructive absorption of high power RF from the MRI transmit pulses. The front of the OLED module was covered by a conductive, transparent mesh. Power was supplied from a non-magnetic battery. The shielding of the display was evaluated by directly measuring the electromagnetic emission with the aid of a pickup loop and a low noise amplifier, as well as by examining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of phantom MRI data. The visual angle of the display was calculated and compared to standard solutions. As a proof of concept of the OLED display for fMRI, a healthy volunteer was presented with a visual block paradigm.The OLED unit was successfully installed inside a 3 T MRI scanner bore. Operation of the OLED unit did not degrade the SNR of the phantom images. The fMRI data suggest that visual stimulation can be effectively delivered to subjects with the proposed OLED unit without any significant interference between the MRI acquisitions and the display module itself.We have constructed and evaluated the MR compatible, dual OLED display for fMRI studies. The proposed OLED display provides the benefits of high resolution, wide visual angle, and high contrast video images during fMRI exams."
https://openalex.org/W2897260133,"The mechanism of fluid slip on a solid surface has been linked to surface diffusion, by which mobile adsorbed fluid molecules perform hops between adsorption sites. However, slip velocity arising from this surface hopping mechanism has been estimated to be significantly lower than that observed experimentally. In this paper, we propose a re-adsorption mechanism for fluid slip. Slip velocity predictions via this mechanism show the improved agreement with experimental measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2896048680,"Biogeochemical maps of coastal regions can be used to identify important influences and inputs that define nearshore environments and biota. Biogeochemical tracers can also track animal movement and their diet, monitor human coastal development, and evaluate the condition of habitats and species. However, the beneficial applications of spatial biogeochemical analysis are hindered by a limited understanding of how tracer distribution is affected by different land and ocean–based influences. To help address these knowledge gaps, we determined the spatial trends of three stable isotopes (δ13C-carbon, δ15N-nitrogen, δ34S-sulfur) and 13 major and trace elements in an urbanized coastal embayment (Moreton Bay, Australia), as incorporated into the muscle tissue of a marine consumer, the eastern king prawn Melicertus plebejus. Results were used to identify unique biochemical regions within the bay and to discuss how spatial patterns in tracers could be used to indicate the relative importance of catchment, urban and offshore drivers in coastal bays. Discriminant analysis identified seven biogeochemical regions that were likely distinguished by variation in catchment, urban, and offshore input, and habitat type. δ13C and δ15N patterns suggested nearshore areas could be distinguished by increased sediment resuspension and higher wastewater inputs from catchments. High inshore lead (Pb) and copper (Cu) concentrations were likely the result of urban input. Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) increased further from shore. This trend implied oceanic influences were a significant control over As and Cd bioavailability. Cobalt (Co) and rare earths were also used to differentiate some nearshore areas, but incongruent distribution patterns in Co suggested it may be less reliable. Overall, results indicated that δ15N, δ13C, Cd, Cu, Pb and rare earth elements were the most reliable tracers to differentiate nearshore and offshore environments, and catchment–based effects. We encourage future studies to consider using a similar multivariate approach in coastal spatial analysis, and to include unrelated tracers that reflect distinct coastal influences."
https://openalex.org/W2898043116,"The surgical technique used in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is crucial for achieving good short and long term clinical outcomes. The medial mobile bearing UKA has shown excellent clinical outcomes and survivorship. But release of the medial collateral ligament during entering joint is cause of mobile bearing dislocation in short term outcomes and lateral compartment osteoarthritis may occur in the mid to long term outcomes. Removing all osteophytes at the time of UKA is sometime impossible due to their large size and extend to the inferior part of medial tibial plateau and removing them completely my result in release of the MCL. But no data exist on clinical outcomes in such patients.We conducted a prospective study from 2010 to 2015 of patients undergoing mobile bearing UKA and classified them in to two groups: those with (Gp1) and without (Gp2) residual osteophytes. Osteophyte size was measured using Hernborg's technique. The primary outcomes were pain score, functional score, and knee scores and the presence of reported medial knee pain.176 patients who underwent 199 mobile bearing UKAs were recruited: Gp1 = 42 patients (46 knees) and Gp2 = 134 patients (153 knees). Residual osteophyte sizes ranged from 2.13-9.42 mm (mean 4.12). The mean Gp1 Gp2 pain score (49.04, 48.92, p = 0.84), functional score (83.75, 84.04, p = 0.83) and knee score (89.86, 98.7, p = 0.0.78) scores were almost identical and no one complained of medial joint pain. Followed up ranged from 2 - 7 years (mean 4.23). No patients were lost to follow up.The patients with residual osteophytes of length less than 9 mm had good and similar clinical outcomes as patients without residual osteophytes following mobile bearing UKA.Level II-2, evidence obtained from well-designed cohort studies or case-control studies, preferably from more than one center or research group."
https://openalex.org/W2896333276,"Several randomized control trials have established that drugs can decrease the heart failure (HF) rehospitalization in patients with HF. However, limited studies have investigated the duration of medicine use to decrease the rehospitalization period in the real world. Hence, this study aims to investigate whether the evidence-based medicine decreases the HF rehospitalization in different treatment intervals in the clinical practice.We examined patients admitted with acute HF from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. In addition, the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were the composite endpoints of the in-hospital mortality and rehospitalization after 1 year. Furthermore, we analyzed the medicine use to decrease 14 days and 1, 6, and 12 months' HF rehospitalization.Overall, we examined 11,012 patients. The use of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers [hazard ratio (HR), 0.58; P < 0.01], β-blocker (HR, 0.67; P < 0.01), spironolactone (HR, 0.63; P < 0.01), and digitalis (HR, 0.67; P < 0.01) associated with the lower in-hospital mortality rate. The Cox regression analysis revealed that RAS blocker (HR, 0.86; P < 0.01) and β-blocker (HR, 0.71; P < 0.01) were independent predictors for MACE. Although RAS blockers declined rehospitalization to 6 months, β-blocker decreased the rehospitalization rate after 1 month use and the benefit persisted till 12 months. Furthermore, digitalis only lowered rehospitalization to 14 days.This study suggests that the use of evidence-based medicine is associated with lower MACE for patients with HF, and these drugs could play vital roles in different periods to decrease the rehospitalization in the clinical setting."
