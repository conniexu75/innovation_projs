https://openalex.org/W1563519230,"Abstract Insoluble antigen and antibody derivatives were obtained when ethyl chloroformate was added to solutions of antigen or antibody. Evidence has been obtained to show that polymerization has occurred and that the protein molecules are linked covalently to one another. The immunoadsorbent properties of these insolubilized proteins were investigated. They were found to be efficient, specific, and stable immunoadsorbents, and were used to isolate specific antibodies from a number of proteins, to isolate antigens from mixtures, and to remove contaminating antigen and antibody proteins from solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2036317831,"A renal tubular epithelial antigen is deposited in association with gamma globulin and complement in glomeruli from rats with experimental allergic glomerulonephritis induced by immunization with renal tubular antigens. Apparently, in normal kidneys this antigen is concentrated in the distal segment of the proximal convoluted tubular epithelium, and the principal source of this antigen in the glomerular deposits is autologous. This form of glomerulonephritis provides an experimental prototype for what may be termed ""autologous immunecomplex"" diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1981653071,"Structural analysis of immunoglobulin light chains has been carried out in an attempt to elucidate the genetic mechanisms involved in antibody synthesis. Analysis of two mouse kappa-chain proteins is almost complete. The differences are localized in one-half of the molecules, and do not reflect the operation of any one mutational mechanism. The peculiar character of the differences is discussed with reference to various theories of antibody formation. The finding that the two proteins differ in size is incompatible with certain proposed theories."
https://openalex.org/W2006624855,"The 17S and 7S immunoglobulins of the smooth dogfish, Mustelus canis, have been characterized with respect to molecular weights, chain structure, amino acid composition, and carbohydrate content. The 17S protein had a molecular weight of 982,000; that of the 7S protein was 198,000. Both proteins had similar amino acid compositions and a carbohydrate content of approximately 8 percent. Light and heavy chains from both immunoglobulins had molecular weights of 20,000 and 72,000 respectively. Apparently both immunoglobulins belong to the same class; this class resembles the gammaM-immunoglobulins of higher vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1952655298,"Abstract Methods for the observation of reversed electron transfer reactions by a quick freezing, trapped steady state method are described. Adenosine triphosphate-activated cytochrome oxidation in the trapped steady state is comparable to that observed at room temperature. Cytochrome oxidation by ATP activation of reversed electron transfer in terminally inhibited mitochondria containing endogenous substrate shows difference spectra of recognized components of the respiratory chain; no unusual compounds are observed. Supplements of oxalacetate or malonate to terminally inhibited mitochondria show on ATP addition not only oxidation of cytochromes in reversed electron transfer, but the formation of an absorption band between those of cytochromes b and c, here interpreted as the formation of the compound b555. Addition of uncoupling agents to terminally inhibited mitochondria containing endogenous substrate causes the decomposition of a new compound which has been tentatively designated as cytochrome b555, on the basis of (a) the positions of the α and γ bands at 77° K, 555 and 425 mµ, respectively; (b) the high ratio of the intensities of the γ to the α bands characteristic of cytochromes of type b; (c) the positions of the α and γ bands (560 and 428 mµ, respectively) at room temperature; and (d) the shift of the α band to a wave length shorter by 5 mµ on cooling from room temperature to a low temperature. With the assumption that the molecular extinction coefficient and low temperature enhancement factor of cytochrome c are applicable to cytochrome b555, the amount of this b555 compound present in pigeon heart mitochondria can be calculated and approaches 50% of that of cytochrome c. The b555 compound is relatively stable, reaching a maximum concentration less than 30 sec after sulfide is added and being detectable for approximately 15 min thereafter. The compound appears at a very low concentration in the presence of highly active reductants such as succinate. The concentration of Dicumarol required for half-maximal decomposition of the compound is 5 µm at room temperature. Other uncoupling agents are effective, for example, 2,4-dinitrophenol and m-chlorodicyanocarbonylphenylhydrazone."
https://openalex.org/W1533402038,"Abstract Addition of small amounts of Ca++ (∼80 nmoles per mg of protein) to rat liver mitochondria in the presence of adenosine triphosphate, Mg++, and fluoride caused stimulation of ATPase activity, accumulation of Ca++, ejection of H+ ions into the medium, and accumulation of phosphate. The molar ratio of Ca++ taken up-H+ ejected-phosphate accumulated-ATP hydrolyzed was found to be approximately 2.0:2.0:1.2:1.0. Together with earlier evidence, these findings indicate that utilization of a single hypothetical high energy intermediate (or its equivalent), whether generated by electron transport or ATP utilization, can cause accumulation of 2 Ca++ ions, ejection of 2 H+ ions, and accumulation of 1.2 phosphate ions. ATP-supported Ca++ uptake was blocked by 2,4-dinitrophenol, Dicumarol, azide, and oligomycin, but not by aurovertin. Other nucleoside 5'-triphosphates, such as guanosine triphosphate, cytidine triphosphate, and uridine triphosphate, failed to support Ca++ uptake. The stoichiometry between Ca++ uptake and H+ ejection was not significantly influenced by changes in pH between 7.2 and 8.2 or by varying the salt concentration from 80 to 320 mm. At pH 6.5, ATP-supported ejection of H+ in the presence of Ca++ underwent rebounds and oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1561164143,"A method has been developed for combining lipids in vitro with delipidized high density lipoprotein (apo-HDL) by mixing a concentrated petroleum ether solution of lipids with an aqueous solution of apo-HDL. When a mixture of plasma lipids was used, combination of phospholipids and cholesterol was observed in amounts comparable with those present in native HDL; triglycerides and cholesterol esters combined, but in much smaller amounts. Free fatty acids combined with apo-HDL and with albumin, but other lipids did not combine with albumin or with other proteins tested. Washing the recombined apo-HDL with petroleum ether did not remove lipids. The mobility of HDL on paper electrophoresis was decreased by removal of all lipids, and this change was reversed by recombination. Practically all the lipids present in the aqueous phase traveled with the protein. The ultracentrifugal sedimentation pattern of HDL was changed by delipidization to give an additional peak with a higher sedimentation coefficient, suggesting aggregation; recombination with lipids reversed this change to give a pattern similar to that of native HDL. Combination with phospholipids alone, either as a petroleum ether solution or as a micellar solution, produced the same change in ultracentrifugal pattern of apo-HDL as did combination with plasma lipid mixture. Cholesterol alone combined with apo-HDL in much smaller amounts than when phospholipids were also present, suggesting that combination of phospholipids with apo-HDL is the primary step in the formation of HDL."
https://openalex.org/W2000120282,Two antigenic subtypes of human lambda polypeptide chains were distinguished by rabbit antiserum produced to a lambda Bence Jones protein. Lambda Bence Jones proteins and G myeloma proteins with lambda light chains were identified as being in one or the other subtype. The Oz (+) lambda chain subtype is present in light chains from pooled normal human immunoglobulin G and in whole normal immunoglobulin G molecules.

https://openalex.org/W35690261,"Upon addition of low concentrations of calcium or manganese to pigeon heart mitochondria in a phosphate-free medium, a characteristic pattern of steady state changes ensues which leads to a high absorbance at 560 mµ (at 300° K) characteristic of cytochrome b. Other components of the respiratory chain are highly oxidized; electron transport from succinate and glutamate is inhibited, as is energy transfer into the pathway for diphosphopyridine nucleotide reduction. The spectroscopic changes and the inhibition of electron transfer represent State 6. Low concentrations of cations are required for half-maximal change in cytochrome b; about 15 µ m calcium gives half-maximal effect. The calcium concentration required is a function of pH; the response of cytochrome b of the largest magnitude is observed at pH 8. High concentrations of calcium (50 to 150 µ m ) decrease this effect. The inhibited state is readily reversed by phosphate, leading to reduction of all the components of the respiratory chain except cytochrome b, which proceeds to a less absorbing state. Under these conditions, the functions of electron transport, energy-linked pyridine nucleotide reduction, and response to adenosine diphosphate are largely restored. The inhibited state of electron transfer is readily reactivated by uncoupling agents, but energy-linked pyridine nucleotide reduction is not reactivated. Examination of cytochrome b spectra at low temperature (77° K) indicates the accumulation of a compound absorbing at 555 mµ in the presence of low concentrations of cations and its transformation to a compound absorbing at 565 mµ upon addition of phosphate. Cytochrome c responds most rapidly to cations; cytochrome b and reduced pyridine nucleotide respond less rapidly, but at low concentrations of cations. The alkalinization of the cristal membrane (29) is a slower reaction that requires higher cation concentrations. Both the reaction of cytochromes with cations and the alkalinization of the cristal membrane are considered as factors in causing the inhibited state of electron transfer, State 6."

https://openalex.org/W1602570978,"Abstract Reversed electron transfer in submitochondrial particles causes the oxidation of cytochromes a3 + a and c, and reduction of cytochrome b upon addition of adenosine triphosphate, indicating a crossover point for the energy-linked reversal of electron transfer between cytochromes c and b. The cytochrome component designaged b555 is uniformly observed to show increased absorption in the low to high energy transition and vice versa. It is tentatively identified as a high energy intermediate in the energy transfer pathway. The 555 mµ compound is distinguished from cytochrome c by its presence in KCl-washed cytochrome c-deficient particles and by the lack of evidence for their interconvertibility. Its identification as a cytochrome of type b is confirmed."
https://openalex.org/W2039531301,"PREVIOUS investigations have indicated that Gm(a)* and Gm(f)* are genetic characters localized in various areas of the major heavy chain class1–3 of human γG globulins. These determinants, detected as antigens, segregate in most populations, as if controlled by allelic genes, and occur independently in myeloma proteins from Caucasians. A previous report indicated that specific reagents for the human genetic factors can be produced by immunizing rabbits with myeloma proteins4. In order to analyse in a more satisfactory way the genetic control of different portions of the heavy chains, it seemed desirable deliberately to immunize with critical protein fragments in order to disclose additional genetic sites believed to be present but not detected by available antisera."

https://openalex.org/W2059645888,"THERE is as yet no ideal method for demonstrating pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO) in tissue culture. Isolation of an infecting strain, particularly if this is intracellular, is frequently technically difficult and is always time-consuming. Cytological examination of monolayer cultures for evidence of PPLO infection is rapid, but staining artefacts may give rise to difficulty in interpretation. Indirect evidence of infection by transmission to susceptible ‘indicator cultures’1 is only valid if these can be maintained free from accidental contamination by PPLO."

Binding of the positively charged thorium micelles with dissociated acid groups of polyanions in this region suggests a possible mechanism for the storage and release of divalent cations such as calcium.

https://openalex.org/W1547311027,"Abstract Acidic metabolites accumulate during d-valine inhibition of actinomycin formation by Streptomyces antibioticus. One of the metabolites appears to be 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, a precursor of the actinomycin chromophore. The data suggest that d-valine prevents the synthesis of the antibiotic pentapeptide chain or its attachment to 4-methyl-3-hydroxyanthranilic acid. A major metabolite of d-valine is N-succinyl-d-valine."

The method is based on the specific binding of I(131)-labeled antigen to the antidogy which has been produced by and has diffused around cells in an agarose medium and which has been precipitated by an antibody to gamma globulin. The antigen-binding zones appear as dark spots on high-speed x-ray film exposed to the dried agarose preparations.

https://openalex.org/W1517302427,"Abstract The aerobic dehydrogenation of the N-methyl group of sarcosine initiates an energy-requiring reduction of diphosphopyridine nucleotide in intact mitochondria. The formation of DPNH can be measured both spectrophotometrically and by the reduction of acetoacetate. Except in the presence of uncouplers, such as Dicumarol and arsenate, reduction of DPN by sarcosine does not require added adenosine triphosphate. The formation of DPNH is inhibited by Amytal, but not by oligomycin. It is proposed that DPN is reduced by electron transfer flavoprotein(2H) via the Amytal-sensitive site of the respiratory chain, and that the energy for this endergonic process can be transferred from the two terminal sites of energy conservation without the participation of inorganic phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2028413826,"IT is well known that an increased vascular permeability produced by various agents can be visualized by the leakage of intravenously administered dye through the affected vessels. The vascularity and high histamine and serotonin content of mouse ears1 suggested that these organs might be useful in the visualization of in vivo antigen–antibody reactions. While investigating the ability of intravenously administered pollen extracts to induce blueing of the ears of mice2, Kind et al. also found that mice sensitized with bovine serum albumin (BSA) developed blueing of the ears when later challenged intravenously with BSA and Evans blue dye. When blueing of the ears was produced in normal mice by the intravenous injection of BSA, rabbit anti-BSA and dye, no latent period was found to be necessary for the ‘fixation’ of antigen or antibody3. Indeed, in mice, maximal incidence of anaphylaxis with rabbit antibody can be obtained by injecting antibody and antigen intravenously in rapid succession4. The apparent absence of a requirement for tissue fixation in mice suggested that blueing of the ears in anaphylactic mice might be useful for detecting such proteins as normal human IgA or myeloma IgA, which will not sensitize guinea-pig skin for reverse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis probably because of the lack of fixation sites on such molecules5."
