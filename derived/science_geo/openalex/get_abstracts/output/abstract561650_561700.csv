https://openalex.org/W2412917277,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare, invariably fatal premature aging disorder. The disease is caused by constitutive production of progerin, a mutant form of the nuclear architectural protein lamin A, leading, through unknown mechanisms, to diverse morphological, epigenetic, and genomic damage and to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) attrition in vivo. Using a high-throughput siRNA screen, we identify the NRF2 antioxidant pathway as a driver mechanism in HGPS. Progerin sequesters NRF2 and thereby causes its subnuclear mislocalization, resulting in impaired NRF2 transcriptional activity and consequently increased chronic oxidative stress. Suppressed NRF2 activity or increased oxidative stress is sufficient to recapitulate HGPS aging defects, whereas reactivation of NRF2 activity in HGPS patient cells reverses progerin-associated nuclear aging defects and restores in vivo viability of MSCs in an animal model. These findings identify repression of the NRF2-mediated antioxidative response as a key contributor to the premature aging phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2418276263,"Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are primarily viewed as static contributors to gene expression. By developing a high-throughput tRNA profiling method, we find that specific tRNAs are upregulated in human breast cancer cells as they gain metastatic activity. Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1-constituting an ""inducible"" pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2413629639,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of associations between common genetic variants and human disease phenotypes, but the majority of these variants are non-coding, often requiring genetic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and individual reporter assays to delineate potential causal variants. We employ a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to simultaneously screen 2,756 variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with 75 sentinel variants associated with red blood cell traits. We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164. Functional follow-up of RBM38 delineates a key role for this gene in the alternative splicing program occurring during terminal erythropoiesis. Finally, we provide evidence for how common GWAS-nominated variants can disrupt cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory pathways."

Our study reveals the dynamic chromatin regulatory landscape during early development and identifies key transcription factors important for DHS establishment in mammalian embryos. Terminally differentiated sperm and egg genomes are organized in very different ways. While sperm genomes are packaged with protamines, egg genomes are occupied by nucleosomes and are transcriptionally inert (Jenkins and Carrell, 2012Jenkins T.G. Carrell D.T. Dynamic alterations in the paternal epigenetic landscape following fertilization.Front. Genet. 2012; 3: 143Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Upon fertilization, the tightly packaged sperm genome undergoes de novo nucleosome assembly before the two parental genomes replicate. This is followed by equal distribution of the replicated chromosomes into the two blastomeres of the 2-cell embryo. After a few round of cleavage divisions, the embryo reaches the morula stage when the first cell lineage specification commences to generate trophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst before implanting to the uterus (Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2014Burton A. Torres-Padilla M.E. Chromatin dynamics in the regulation of cell fate allocation during early embryogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Preimplantation development harbors two cell fate transitions. First, the highly differentiated germ cells (sperm and egg) are reprogrammed into a totipotent state characterized by having the highest level of cell fate plasticity (Rossant, 1976Rossant J. Postimplantation development of blastomeres isolated from 4- and 8-cell mouse eggs.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1976; 36: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar). The second cell fate transition takes place when the morula stage cells commit to either the trophectoderm lineage or pluripotent ICM cells (Morgan et al., 2005Morgan H.D. Santos F. Green K. Dean W. Reik W. Epigenetic reprogramming in mammals.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R47-R58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Concurrent with the cell fate transitions are dramatic chromatin and transcriptional changes. One of the most notable transcriptional changes taking place during mammalian preimplantation development is zygotic genome activation (ZGA) (Svoboda et al., 2015Svoboda P. Franke V. Schultz R.M. Sculpting the Transcriptome During the Oocyte-to-Embryo Transition in Mouse.Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2015; 113: 305-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In mice, a major ZGA takes place in 2-cell embryos (Hamatani et al., 2004Hamatani T. Carter M.G. Sharov A.A. Ko M.S. Dynamics of global gene expression changes during mouse preimplantation development.Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 117-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that ZGA plays an essential role in preimplantation development, no transcription factor (TF) responsible for mammalian major ZGA has been identified. Consequently, the mechanism underlying mammalian ZGA is largely unknown. Recent studies have revealed several TFs, including Zelda, Pou5f1, Nanog, and SoxB1, to be important for ZGA in Drosophila and/or zebrafish (Lee et al., 2013Lee M.T. Bonneau A.R. Takacs C.M. Bazzini A.A. DiVito K.R. Fleming E.S. Giraldez A.J. Nanog, Pou5f1 and SoxB1 activate zygotic gene expression during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.Nature. 2013; 503: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 2008Liang H.L. Nien C.Y. Liu H.Y. Metzstein M.M. Kirov N. Rushlow C. The zinc-finger protein Zelda is a key activator of the early zygotic genome in Drosophila.Nature. 2008; 456: 400-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These TFs are unlikely to be involved in mammalian ZGA as the mammalian counterpart either does not exist or is not expressed at an appreciable level before ZGA. Mammalian ZGA might be mechanistically different from that of Drosophila and zebrafish as mammalian ZGA takes place early during preimplantation development, while Drosophila/zebrafish ZGA takes place at a much later developmental stage (at cell cycle 14 in Drosophila and cell cycle 10 in zebrafish) (Lee et al., 2014Lee M.T. Bonneau A.R. Giraldez A.J. Zygotic genome activation during the maternal-to-zygotic transition.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2014; 30: 581-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells at a particular state possess a defined set of cis-regulatory elements that are accessible to trans-acting factors, which underlies the chromatin regulatory network of the cell state (Bell et al., 2011Bell O. Tiwari V.K. Thomä N.H. Schübeler D. Determinants and dynamics of genome accessibility.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, Gross and Garrard, 1988Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Nuclease hypersensitive sites in chromatin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Understanding the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during preimplantation development may provide insights into the chromatin and cell fate regulation during the process. DNase I hypersensitivity is one of the best measures of chromatin accessibility (Bell et al., 2011Bell O. Tiwari V.K. Thomä N.H. Schübeler D. Determinants and dynamics of genome accessibility.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and has been widely used to map functional elements, including promoters, enhancers, insulators, and locus control regions, as these regions are relatively more accessible (Gross and Garrard, 1988Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Nuclease hypersensitive sites in chromatin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Recently, DNase I treatment coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (DNase-seq) has allowed high-resolution genome-wide mapping of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) (Boyle et al., 2008Boyle A.P. Davis S. Shulha H.P. Meltzer P. Margulies E.H. Weng Z. Furey T.S. Crawford G.E. High-resolution mapping and characterization of open chromatin across the genome.Cell. 2008; 132: 311-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, millions of regulatory elements in diverse tissue and cell types have been identified in mammalian genome (Thurman et al., 2012Thurman R.E. Rynes E. Humbert R. Vierstra J. Maurano M.T. Haugen E. Sheffield N.C. Stergachis A.B. Wang H. Vernot B. et al.The accessible chromatin landscape of the human genome.Nature. 2012; 489: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar, Vierstra et al., 2014Vierstra J. Rynes E. Sandstrom R. Zhang M. Canfield T. Hansen R.S. Stehling-Sun S. Sabo P.J. Byron R. Humbert R. et al.Mouse regulatory DNA landscapes reveal global principles of cis-regulatory evolution.Science. 2014; 346: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Despite high resolution and robustness of the DNase-seq technique, millions of cells are needed, thereby limiting its application in rare biological samples. Therefore, how the DHS landscape of the pluripotent ICM is initially established during early development is unknown. In addition to DNase-seq, a technique called ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) has also been developed and used in studying chromatin accessibility (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Transposition of native chromatin for fast and sensitive epigenomic profiling of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins and nucleosome position.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Recently, two single-cell ATAC-seq methods have been developed and used in analyzing chromatin heterogeneity among populations of cells (Buenrostro et al., 2015Buenrostro J.D. Wu B. Litzenburger U.M. Ruff D. Gonzales M.L. Snyder M.P. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J. Single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles of regulatory variation.Nature. 2015; 523: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, Cusanovich et al., 2015Cusanovich D.A. Daza R. Adey A. Pliner H.A. Christiansen L. Gunderson K.L. Steemers F.J. Trapnell C. Shendure J. Epigenetics. Multiplex single-cell profiling of chromatin accessibility by combinatorial cellular indexing.Science. 2015; 348: 910-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of the single-cell ATAC-seq data relies on pre-existing chromatin accessibility maps generated using large numbers of cells. DNA loss through the multiple purification steps of traditional DNase-seq is the major reason for its low sensitivity. By minimizing DNA loss, a single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) method has been recently developed and used in analyzing chromatin accessibility using as few as one cell (Jin et al., 2015Jin W. Tang Q. Wan M. Cui K. Zhang Y. Ren G. Ni B. Sklar J. Przytycka T.M. Childs R. et al.Genome-wide detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells and FFPE tissue samples.Nature. 2015; 528: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, interpretation of the single-cell scDNase-seq data also requires a pre-existing DHS map. Consequently, it remains unknown whether these methods can be used for de novo identification of genome-wide chromatin accessible sites using a small number of cells. In this study, we modified the scDNase-seq method to achieve de novo genome-wide DHS mapping using as few as 30 cells. Using this low-input DNase-seq (liDNase-seq) method, we have generated DHS maps of mouse preimplantation embryos from 1-cell to the morula stage, revealing the dynamics of chromatin accessibility during mouse preimplantation development process. Using the DHS information, we identified key transcriptional factors involved in the establishment of the regulatory landscape early in mammalian life. Conventional DNase-seq for de novo genome-wide DHS mapping requires millions of cells (Boyle et al., 2008Boyle A.P. Davis S. Shulha H.P. Meltzer P. Margulies E.H. Weng Z. Furey T.S. Crawford G.E.

Humbert R. et al.Mouse regulatory DNA landscapes reveal global principles of cis-regulatory evolution.Science. 2014; 346: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), preventing its application to rare samples. To overcome this limitation, we made a few modifications to the scDNase-seq method (Jin et al., 2015Jin W. Tang Q. Wan M. Cui K. Zhang Y. Ren G. Ni B. Sklar J. Przytycka T.M. Childs R. et al.Genome-wide detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells and FFPE tissue samples.Nature. 2015; 528: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) to further prevent DNA loss during sequencing library construction (Figure S1A). The major improvements include (1) reduction of the purification steps before adaptor ligation and the first amplification and (2) usage of SPRI affinity beads instead of gel purification for size selection. Employing this modified method, we generated DHS maps of 100 and 30 mouse ESCs. We found that both samples generated DHS maps that were highly similar to those of the ENCODE project using 10–20 million ESCs (Figure S1B). Scatterplot analysis revealed a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.93 between the data generated using 30 cells and that of the ENCODE project (Figure S1C). Moreover, the 30-cell and 100-cell data have a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.98, indicating high reproducibility of the method (Figure S1C). Using Hotspot program (John et al., 2011John S. Sabo P.J. Thurman R.E. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Johnson T.A. Hager G.L. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Chromatin accessibility pre-determines glucocorticoid receptor binding patterns.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), we identified 49,157 and 77,589 DHSs (FDR < 0.01) from 30-cell and 100-cell data, respectively. Of the 21,330 most reliable DHSs identified by the ENCODE project (FDR < 0.01 and rpm > 2), 93% and 77% were identified by the liDNase-seq using 100 and 30 cells, respectively (Figure S1D). Conversely, of the 44,304 and 29,305 DHSs (FDR < 0.01 and rpm > 1) detected using 30 and 100 cells, 86% and 97% were identified in the ENCODE project (219,515 DHSs, FDR < 0.01), respectively (Figure S1E). These results indicate that the liDNase-seq method allows de novo mapping of DHSs at high resolution using as few as 30 cells without the need of a pre-existing DHS map. To understand how the chromatin regulatory landscape is established during mouse preimplantation development, we applied the liDNase-seq method to 1-cell, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stage embryos using 100–200 blastomeres for each sample with two biological replicates in each developmental stage to ascertain generation of high-quality and reproducible dataset (Table S1). Comparative analyses indicate that data from the two independent biological replicates in each developmental stage have high reproducibility (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: 0.717–0.895) (Figure S2A). Thus, we combined the data and used the common DHSs from the two replicates for subsequent analysis. As a reference of chromatin regulatory landscape of pluripotent cells, the ESC DHS map generated by liDNase-seq using 100 cells was used. Using stringent criteria (Hotspot FDR < 0.01 and RPM > 1 in both replicates), we identified 844, 1,006, 2,957, 12,323, 19,476, and 23,418 DHSs using the uniquely mapped reads at the 1-cell, 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and morula stage embryos and ESCs, respectively (Figure 1A and Table S2). The numbers of DHS increase during preimplantation development, suggesting progressive increase of chromatin accessibility at the primary structure level during this process (Figure 1A). To characterize these DHSs, we examined their genomic distribution on annotated genes defined by Refseq (Figure 1B). We found that 87.2% of the DHSs are located at promoter regions at the 1-cell embryos. This ratio decreased in 2-cell embryos (77.2%), and DHSs at distal regions, including distal exons, introns, and intergenic regions, are increased (Figure 1B). While there was no big difference in the DHS distribution between 2-cell and 4-cell embryos, a drastic increase was detected in the 8-cell embryos with about half of the DHSs located in the distal regions (Figure 1B). The DHS distribution pattern of morula-stage embryos is similar to that of the 8-cell embryos but is further shifted to distal distribution in ESCs (Figure 1B). The DHSs are highly enriched in promoter regions in embryos of all the developmental stages and ESCs (Figure 1B), which further supports the reliability of our DHS mapping results. These DHSs are distributed across the genome without obvious bias toward any specific chromosome or chromosome domains (Figure S2B). To confirm the liDNase-seq results, we performed qPCR analysis of the remaining intact DNA after limited DNase treatment at several DHSs identified by liDNase-seq using 4-cell and morula stage embryos. Consistent with liDNase-seq results, the accessible sites had decreased amount of intact DNA remnants while the inaccessible sites did not (Figure S3). Taken together, our results suggest that DHS distribution is dynamically changed during preimplantation development, especially at the 2-cell and 8-cell stages when many newly formed DHSs appear in distal regions.Figure 1DHSs Are Gradually Established during Preimplantation DevelopmentShow full caption(A) Bar graphs illustrate the number of DHSs detected at each stage of embryo development.(B) Graph illustrates genomic distribution of the DHSs relative to Refseq annotations.

(D) Intact DNA after limited DNase I treatment at loci inaccessible in both 4-cell and morula stage embryos Next, we examined the dynamics of individual DHSs during preimplantation development (Figures 1C and 1D). Using DHSs at morula stage as a reference, we found that 96.4% of 1-cell DHSs are maintained during preimplantation development. Similarly, 91.7% of 2-cell DHSs, 94.5% of 4-cell DHSs, and 75.9% of 8-cell DHSs are maintained until the morula stage. Taken together, our liDNase-seq analyses reveal that DHSs are progressively established during preimplantation development and are largely maintained once established. To reveal the detail of DHS dynamics during preimplantation development, we analyzed DHSs gained or lost at each stage. The number of gained DHSs gradually increases during development with the largest increase at the 8-cell and morula stage (Figure 2A). In contrast, the number of lost DHSs is relatively low until the morula stage (Figure 2A). These results are consistent with our observation that the majority of the DHSs are maintained during preimplantation development once they are established. Next, we examined the genomic location of these dynamic DHSs and found that the gained DHSs tend to locate in distal regions compared to all the DHSs at the previous stage (Figures 2B). This is also true for the lost DHSs, especially at the morula stage when more than 80% of the lost DHSs are located in distal regions (Figure 2B). These data indicate that distal DHSs are more dynamic compared to promoter DHSs. To gain insight into the potential function of the dynamic DHSs, we performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the genes related to 1-cell DHSs and dynamic DHSs at subsequent developmental stages. In 1-cell embryos, the most enriched GO term of the genes with promoter DHSs was cell cycle (Figure 1C), which is consistent with the fact that fertilization triggers the MII-stage arrested eggs to restart the cell cycle. The DHSs gained at the 2-cell stage were enriched for DNA replication and macroautophagy (Figure 2C), which is in line with active DNA replication and autophagy in early preimplantation embryos (Tsukamoto et al., 2008Tsukamoto S. Kuma A. Murakami M. Kishi C. Yamamoto A. Mizushima N. Autophagy is essential for preimplantation development of mouse embryos.Science. 2008; 321: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). DHSs gained at the 4-cell stage were enriched for DNA repair, spindle assembly, and protein homeostasis. Interestingly, DHSs gained at the 8-cell stage were enriched for gene expression regulation and protein acetylation, which is consistent with increased expression of various chromatin-modifying enzymes at the 8-cell stage (Burton et al., 2013Burton A. Muller J. Tu S. Padilla-Longoria P. Guccione E. Torres-Padilla M.-E. Single-cell profiling of epigenetic modifiers identifies PRDM14 as an inducer of cell fate in the mammalian embryo.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 687-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In addition, genes involved in blastocyst growth begin to become accessible at this stage. The DHSs gained at morula stage were most enriched for blastocyst development and trophectodermal cell differentiation, suggesting that the chromatin regulatory landscape has already prepared for the first cell lineage specification at the morula stage. Unlike the gained DHSs, no GO term enrichment was found in lost DHSs except for the morula stage, where chromatin remodeling and covalent modifications were enriched (Figure 2C). The DHSs presented in ESCs, but not in 1-cell to morula embryos, are associated with later differentiation and development (Figure 2D), which is consistent with the expression of genes associated with later developmental processes in serum-cultured ESCs (Marks et al., 2012Marks H. Kalkan T. Menafra R. Denissov S. Jones K. Hofemeister H. Nichols J. Kranz A. Stewart A.F. Smith A. Stunnenberg H.G. The transcriptional and epigenomic foundations of ground state pluripotency.Cell. 2012; 149: 590-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the chromatin regulatory landscape is linked to intracellular functions of preimplantation embryos. To understand the relationship between DHSs and transcription activity, we integrated the DHS information with the transcriptome of mouse preimplantation embryos (Xue et al., 2013Xue Z. Huang K. Cai C. Cai L. Jiang C.Y. Feng Y. Liu Z. Zeng Q. Cheng L. Sun Y.E. et al.Genetic programs in human and mouse early embryos revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing.Nature. 2013; 500: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In general, genes with promoter DHSs are expressed at a higher level compared to those without promoter DHSs in all stages of preimplantation embryos (Figure 3A). Although a majority of promoters with detectable DNase I hypersensitivity signal are active, we noticed that a significant portion (5.7%–18.2%) of the silenced promoters also harbor the detectable signal (Figure 3B, dotted boxes). After a close examination, we found that most genes (72%–85%) harboring promoter DHSs are expressed in each developmental stage (Figures S4A and S4B), while many of the silent genes with promoter DHSs start transcription at a later developmental stage (FPKM ≥ 1 and FC > 2), indicating that these promoters are primed for activation (Figures 3C, 3D, S4A, and S4C). Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that genes primed at the 8-cell stage were enriched in organic acid biosynthesis, cell projection organization, and actin filament-based process (Figure 3E), while genes primed at the morula stage are enriched in chromatin organization. Thus, DHSs can mark promoters either actively transcribing or primed for subsequent activation.Figure S4Promoter DHSs and Transcriptional Activation, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Genes harboring promoter DHSs were classified into 3 groups based on their transcription status.(B) Representative genes whose DHS formation correlates with transcriptional activation.

https://openalex.org/W2414953140,"Many studies have focused on the mechanisms underlying length and width determination in rod-shaped bacteria. Here, we focus instead on cell surface area to volume ratio (SA/V) and demonstrate that SA/V homeostasis underlies size determination. We propose a model whereby the instantaneous rates of surface and volume synthesis both scale with volume. This model predicts that these relative rates dictate SA/V and that cells approach a new steady-state SA/V exponentially, with a decay constant equal to the volume growth rate. To test this, we exposed diverse bacterial species to sublethal concentrations of a cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor and observed dose-dependent decreases in SA/V. Furthermore, this decrease was exponential and had the expected decay constant. The model also quantitatively describes SA/V alterations induced by other chemical, nutritional, and genetic perturbations. We additionally present evidence for a surface material accumulation threshold underlying division, sensitizing cell length to changes in SA/V requirements."

(Sc) to determine the optimum level of fish-oil substitution (partial or complete) for maximum growth of Nile tilapia. When we fully replaced fish oil with Schizochytrium (Sc100 diet), we found significantly higher weight gain and protein efficiency ratio (PER), and lower (improved) feed conversion ratio (FCR) and feed intake compared to a control diet containing fish oil (Sc0); and no significant change in SGR and survival rate among all diets. The Sc100 diet had the highest contents of 22:6n3 DHA, led to the highest DHA content in fillets, and consequently led to the highest DHA:EPA ratios in tilapia fillets. Schizochytrium sp. is a high quality candidate for complete substitution of fish oil in juvenile Nile tilapia feeds, providing an innovative means to formulate and optimize the composition of tilapia juvenile feed while simultaneously raising feed efficiency of tilapia aquaculture and to further develop environmentally and socially sustainable aquafeeds. Results show that replacing fish oil with DHA-rich marine Sc improves the deposition of n3 LC PUFA levels in tilapia fillet. These results support further studies to lower Schizochytrium production costs and to combine different marine microalgae to replace fish oil and fishmeal into aquafeeds."
https://openalex.org/W2413692136,"Objectives As trials were assessing the safety and efficacy of daily oral antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV infection, there was a clear need to understand the evolution of knowledge of, and attitudes toward, PrEP among primary care clinicians. Methods Physicians and nurse practitioners were surveyed in 2009 (n = 1500), 2010 (n = 1504), 2012 (n = 1503), 2013 (n = 1507), 2014 (n = 1508) and 2015 (n = 1501) to assess their awareness of PrEP, willingness to prescribe PrEP, and whether they support use of public funds to pay for PrEP. Pharmacists (n = 251) were surveyed about PrEP in 2012 only. Descriptive statistics were computed for physician demographics and PrEP-related questions. Prevalence ratios for willingness to prescribe PrEP were computed using Poisson regression analysis. Results Awareness of PrEP was low among clinicians (2009: 24%, 2010: 29%) but increased after trials reported effectiveness (2012: 49%, 2013: 51%, 2014: 61%, 2015: 66%). Following a description of PrEP with an estimated effectiveness of 75%, across 6 of the study years 91% of clinicians indicated a willingness to prescribe PrEP to at least one group at high risk of HIV acquisition. A smaller majority of clinicians indicated support for public funding of PrEP in 2009: 59%, 2010: 53%, and 2013: 63%. Conclusions In surveys conducted before and after the release of PrEP trial results, primary care clinicians were largely unaware of PrEP. They indicated high levels of willingness to prescribe it for patients at high risk of HIV acquisition and expressed interest in education about how to deliver this new clinical HIV prevention method. It will be important to continue monitoring clinician knowledge, attitudes, and practices as the use of PrEP increases in the US."
https://openalex.org/W2416333604,"Protein ubiquitination involves E1, E2, and E3 trienzyme cascades. E2 and RING E3 enzymes often collaborate to first prime a substrate with a single ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E2s, UBE2C (aka UBCH10) and UBE2S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE2C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain elongation, the RING does not bind UBE2S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE2S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys11-linked chain. Our findings define mechanisms of APC/C regulation, and establish principles by which specialized E3-E2-substrate-UB architectures control different forms of polyubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2417877795,"Background Longitudinal data are data in which each variable is measured repeatedly over time. One possibility for the analysis of such data is to cluster them. The majority of clustering methods group together individual that have close trajectories at given time points. These methods group trajectories that are locally close but not necessarily those that have similar shapes. However, in several circumstances, the progress of a phenomenon may be more important than the moment at which it occurs. One would thus like to achieve a partitioning where each group gathers individuals whose trajectories have similar shapes whatever the time lag between them. Method In this article, we present a longitudinal data partitioning algorithm based on the shapes of the trajectories rather than on classical distances. Because this algorithm is time consuming, we propose as well two data simplification procedures that make it applicable to high dimensional datasets. Results In an application to Alzheimer disease, this algorithm revealed a “rapid decline” patient group that was not found by the classical methods. In another application to the feminine menstrual cycle, the algorithm showed, contrarily to the current literature, that the luteinizing hormone presents two peaks in an important proportion of women (22%)."

A culture filtrate of Aspergillus niger F22 was highly active against Meloidogyne incognita with marked mortality of second-stage juveniles (J2s) and inhibition of egg hatching. The nematicidal component was identified as oxalic acid by organic acid analysis and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Exposure to 2 mmol/L oxalic acid resulted in 100% juvenile mortality at 1 day after treatment and suppressed egg hatching by 95.6% at 7 days after treatment. Oxalic acid showed similar nematicidal activity against M. hapla, but was not highly toxic to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The fungus was incubated on solid medium and dried culture was used for preparation of a wettable powder-type (WP) formulation as an active ingredient. Two WP formulations, F22-WP10 (ai 10%) and oxalic acid-WP8 (ai 8%), were prepared using F22 solid culture and oxalic acid. In a field naturally infested with M. incognita, application of a mixture of F22-WP10 + oxalic acid-WP8 at 1,000- and 500-fold dilutions significantly reduced gall formation on the roots of watermelon plants by 58.8 and 70.7%, respectively, compared to the non-treated control. The disease control efficacy of the mixture of F22-WP10 + oxalic acid-WP8 was significantly higher than that of a chemical nematicide, Sunchungtan (ai 30% fosthiazate). These results suggest that A. niger F22 can be used as a microbial nematicide for the control of root-knot nematode disease."

It is necessary to develop a model to predict the hepatitis epidemic that could be useful for preventing this disease.The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model were used to fit the incidence data from the Heng County CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) from January 2005 to December 2012. Then, the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was developed. The incidence data from January 2013 to December 2013 were used to validate the models. Several parameters, including mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean square error (MSE), were used to compare the performance among the three models.The morbidity of hepatitis from Jan 2005 to Dec 2012 has seasonal variation and slightly rising trend. The ARIMA(0,1,2)(1,1,1)12 model was the most appropriate one with the residual test showing a white noise sequence. The smoothing factor of the basic GRNN model and the combined model was 1.8 and 0.07, respectively. The four parameters of the hybrid model were lower than those of the two single models in the validation. The parameters values of the GRNN model were the lowest in the fitting of the three models.The hybrid ARIMA-GRNN model showed better hepatitis incidence forecasting in Heng County than the single ARIMA model and the basic GRNN model.

https://openalex.org/W2414754150,"The high circulating levels of histones found in various thrombotic diseases may compromise the anticoagulant barrier of endothelial cells. We determined how histones affect endothelial procoagulant tissue factor (TF) and anticoagulant thrombomodulin (TM). Surface antigens, soluble forms, and mRNA levels of TF and TM were measured by flow cytometry, ELISA, and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. TF and TM activity were measured using procoagulant activity, thrombin generation, or chromogenic assays. Involvement of the toll-like receptor (TLR) was assessed using the neutralizing antibodies. Histones dose-dependently induced surface antigens, activity and mRNA levels of endothelial TF. Histone-treated endothelial cells significantly shortened the lag time and enhanced the endogenous thrombin potential of normal plasma, which was normalized by a TF neutralizing antibody. Histones induced phosphatidylserine and protein-disulfide isomerase expression in endothelial cells. Histones also reduced the surface antigen, activity, and mRNA levels of endothelial TM. Polysialic acid and heparin reversed the histone-induced TF up-regulation and TM down-regulation. Activated protein C did not affect the TF up-regulation, but interrupted TM down-regulation. TLR2, and TLR4 inhibitors partially blocked the TF up-regulation. Histones induced the endothelial procoagulant phenotype through TF up-regulation and TM down-regulation. The effects of histones were partly mediated by TLR2, TLR4. Strategies to inhibit the harmful effects of histones in endothelial cells may be required in order to prevent a thrombotic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2410411921,"Oysters have important ecological functions in their natural environment, acting as global carbon sinks and improving water quality by removing excess nutrients from the water column. During their life-time oysters are exposed to a variety of pathogens that can cause severe mortality in a range of oyster species. Environmental stressors encountered in their habitat can increase the susceptibility of oysters to these pathogens and in general have been shown to impact on oyster immunity, making immune parameters expressed in these marine animals an important research topic.Paired-end Illumina high throughput sequencing of six S. glomerata tissues exposed to different environmental stressors resulted in a total of 484,121,702 paired-end reads. When reads and assembled transcripts were compared to the C. gigas genome, an overall low level of similarity at the nucleotide level, but a relatively high similarity at the protein level was observed. Examination of the tissue expression pattern showed that some transcripts coding for cathepsins, heat shock proteins and antioxidant proteins were exclusively expressed in the haemolymph of S. glomerata, suggesting a role in innate immunity. Furthermore, analysis of the S. glomerata ORFs showed a wide range of genes potentially involved in innate immunity, from pattern recognition receptors, components of the Toll-like signalling and apoptosis pathways to a complex antioxidant defence mechanism.This is the first large scale RNA-Seq study carried out in S. glomerata, showing the complex network of innate immune components that exist in this species. The results confirmed that many of the innate immune system components observed in mammals are also conserved in oysters; however, some, such as the TLR adaptors MAL, TRIF and TRAM are either missing or have been modified significantly. The components identified in this study could help explain the oysters' natural resilience against pathogenic microorganisms encountered in their natural environment."

We aimed to identify patterns of associative multimorbidity among mid-aged women and the lifestyle and socioeconomic factors associated with their development.Participants were from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. We included 4896 women born 1946-51, without multimorbidity in 1998. We identified multimorbidity patterns at survey 6 (2010) using factor analysis, and related these patterns to baseline lifestyle and socioeconomic factors using logistic regression. We dichotomised factor scores and determined odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between characteristics and odds of a high versus low factor score.We identified five multimorbidity patterns: psychosomatic; musculoskeletal; cardiometabolic; cancer; and respiratory. Overweight and obesity were respectively associated with increased odds of having a high score for the musculoskeletal (adjusted ORs 1.45 [95% CI 1.23, 1.70] and 2.14 [95% CI 1.75, 2.60]) and cardiometabolic (adjusted ORs 1.53 [95% CI 1.31, 1.79] and 2.46 [95% CI 2.02, 2.98]) patterns. Physical inactivity was associated with increased odds of a high score for the psychosomatic, musculoskeletal and cancer patterns (adjusted ORs 1.41 [95% CI 1.13, 1.76]; 1.39 [95% CI 1.11, 1.74]; and 1.35 [95% CI 1.08, 1.69]). Smoking was associated with increased odds of a high score for the respiratory pattern. Education and ability to manage on income were associated with increased odds of a high score for the psychosomatic pattern (adjusted ORs 1.34 [95% CI 1.03, 1.75] and 1.73 [95% CI 1.37, 1.28], respectively) and musculoskeletal pattern (adjusted ORs 1.43 [95% CI 1.10, 1.87] and 1.38 [1.09, 1.75], respectively).Distinct multimorbidity patterns can be identified among mid-aged women.

https://openalex.org/W2414660360,"Cell viability requires adaptation to changing environmental conditions. Ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis plays a crucial role in this process, because it provides a mechanism to remove transport proteins from the membrane. Arrestin-related trafficking proteins are important regulators of the endocytic pathway in yeast, facilitating selective ubiquitylation of target proteins by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5. Specifically, Rod1 (Art4) has been reported to regulate the endocytosis of both the Hxt1, Hxt3, and Hxt6 glucose transporters and the Jen1 lactate transporter. Also, the AMP kinase homologue, Snf1, and 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to regulate Jen1 via Rod1. Here, we further characterized the role of Rod1, Snf1, and 14-3-3 in the signal transduction route involved in the endocytic regulation of the Hxt6 high affinity glucose transporter by showing that Snf1 interacts specifically with Rod1 and Rog3 (Art7), that the interaction between the Bmh2 and several arrestin-related trafficking proteins may be modulated by carbon source, and that both the 14-3-3 protein Bmh2 and the Snf1 regulatory domain interact with the arrestin-like domain containing the N-terminal half of Rod1 (amino acids 1–395). Finally, using both co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation, we demonstrated the interaction of Rod1 with Hxt6 and showed that the localization of the Rod1-Hxt6 complex at the plasma membrane is affected by carbon source and is reduced upon overexpression of SNF1 and BMH2.

An important component of the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and stress responses is the regulation of the composition of plasma membrane proteins responsible for the uptake and extrusion of nutrients and other nonpermeable small molecules. The general mechanisms controlling this regulatory process are highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms and involve both transcriptional regulation and modulation of the balance of secretion, recycling, and degradation of individual transporter proteins in response to changes in the extracellular environment (reviewed in Ref. 1.Mulet J.M. Llopis-Torregrosa V. Primo C. Marqués M.C. Yenush L. Endocytic regulation of alkali metal transport proteins in mammals, yeast and plants.Curr. Genet. 2013; 59: 207-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Regulated endocytosis, one important step in this process, has been well studied in both mammals and yeast, unveiling many mechanistic similarities that establish yeast as a relevant model system. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plasma membrane transporters that need to be down-regulated are ubiquitylated by the Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase, endocytosed, sorted into multivesicular bodies in a process requiring the ESCRT machinery, and finally are delivered to the vacuole for degradation (2.Hein C.

Transporter ubiquitylation by the HECT family Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin ligase is mediated by one or more of several adaptor proteins that confer specificity and ensure the correct regulation of targeted proteins in response to changes in the extracellular environment (reviewed in Refs. 6.Lauwers E.

At least 18 Rsp5 adaptor proteins have been described, each having specificity for a subset of transport proteins and acting in response to specific stimuli. The molecular mechanisms governing these regulatory interactions are beginning to be clarified. For example, one subset of the Rsp5 adaptor proteins shows structural conservation and has been assigned to the arrestin-related trafficking (ART) 4The abbreviations used are: ART, arrestin-related trafficking protein; BiFC, bimolecular fluorescence complementation; TGN, trans-Golgi network. adaptor family (7.Lin C.H.

Arrestin-related ubiquitin-ligase adaptors regulate endocytosis and protein turnover at the cell surface.Cell. 2008; 135: 714-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The 14 members of this protein family contain a conserved fold in their N terminus that shows structural homology to the mammalian α and β arrestins and 1–3 repeats of the Rsp5 binding (L/P)PXY motif (8.Aubry L. Klein G. True arrestins and arrestin-fold proteins: a structure-based appraisal.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 118: 21-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In yeast, physical interactions have been demonstrated between Rsp5 adaptors Ecm21 (Art2) and Aly2 (Art3) with the Smf1 divalent metal cation transporter and the Dip5 aspartic acid permease, respectively (9.Hatakeyama R. Kamiya M. Takahara T. Maeda T. Endocytosis of the aspartic acid/glutamic acid transporter Dip5 is triggered by substrate-dependent recruitment of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase via the arrestin-like protein Aly2.Mol. Cell.

Arrestin-like proteins mediate ubiquitination and endocytosis of the yeast metal transporter Smf1.EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 1216-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the case of Dip5, addition of excess substrate was shown to increase the interaction with Aly2, whereas in the case of Ecm21, no alterations in Smf1 interaction were observed. Importantly, where within the cell these protein-protein interactions take place has not been extensively studied. In other cases, genetic evidence supports a role for the requirement for Rsp5 adaptors for the down-regulation of defined transporters but direct proof of physical interactions has not yet been reported (7.Lin C.H. MacGurn J.A. Chu T. Stefan C.J. Emr S.D.

Pelham H.R. Arrestin-mediated endocytosis of yeast plasma membrane transporters.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The endocytic activity of Rsp5 adaptor proteins has been shown to be modulated by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation switches in several cases. The first example was modulation of the activity of Ldb19(Art1) by the TORC1-responsive kinase, Npr1. Hyperphosphorylation of Ldb19 by Npr1 was shown to inhibit its endocytic activity for the Can1 arginine permease (12.MacGurn J.A. Hsu P.C. Smolka M.B. Emr S.D. TORC1 regulates endocytosis via Npr1-mediated phosphoinhibition of a ubiquitin ligase adaptor.Cell. 2011; 147: 1104-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The Npr1 kinase was also shown to inhibit the endocytic activity of the Bul1 and Bul2 Rsp5 adaptors by creating binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins, which then impede the degradation of the Gap1 general amino acid permease, presumably by preventing the association of the Rsp5-adaptor complex with Gap1 (13.Merhi A. André B. Internal amino acids promote Gap1 permease ubiquitylation via TORC1/Npr1/14-3-3-dependent control of the Bul arrestin-like adaptors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2012; 32: 4510-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this case, the Sit4 phosphatase has been proposed to be involved in Bul1 and Bul2 dephosphorylation, leading to their activation and subsequent down-regulation of Gap1 under the appropriate conditions, although direct dephosphorylation of Bul1 and Bul2 by Sit4 was not demonstrated. In addition, the calcineurin phosphatase was shown to directly dephosphorylate another Rsp5 adaptor Aly2, promoting its endocytic activity for Dip5, but not for Gap1 (14.O'Donnell A.F. Huang L. Thorner J. Cyert M.S. A calcineurin-dependent switch controls the trafficking function of α-arrestin Aly1/Art6.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24063-24080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies show that complex regulatory routes are employed to fine-tune the cohort of transport proteins present in the plasma membrane in response to the quality of the nitrogen source. The Rsp5 adaptor network has also been shown to respond to changes in the carbon source. On one hand, Rod1 was shown genetically to be involved in the down-regulation of the Hxt6 high affinity glucose permease and was also implicated in the endocytosis of the Hxt1 and Hxt3 transporters in response to 2-deoxyglucose (11.Nikko E. Pelham H.R. Arrestin-mediated endocytosis of yeast plasma membrane transporters.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15.O'Donnell A.F. McCartney R.R.

This adaptor was also shown to regulate the Rsp5-mediated ubiquitylation of the Jen1 lactate transporter in response to glucose addition and the Ste2 pheromone receptor (16.Becuwe M. Vieira N.

Biol. 2014; 34: 2660-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the report studying Jen1 regulation, the Snf1 kinase, which was previously shown to phosphorylate Rod1 (19.Shinoda J. Kikuchi Y. Rod1, an arrestin-related protein, is phosphorylated by Snf1-kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), was shown to create binding sites for the 14-3-3 proteins. Similar to what was observed for Bul1 and Bul2, 14-3-3 binding to Rod1 was shown to impede Jen1 delivery and subsequent degradation in the vacuole. In both cases, 14-3-3 binding to the Rsp5 adaptor is postulated to block the interaction with the targeted transporter, although this has not been experimentally proven. In the present study, we aimed to further characterize the signal transduction route involved in the endocytic regulation of the Hxt6 high affinity glucose transporter. We show that the Snf1 kinase interacts physically with both the Rod1 Rsp5 adaptor protein and with the closely related Rog3 adaptor, but not with other ART family members. We also show that the 14-3-3 protein Bmh2 interacts with many ART family members, suggesting a general role for these proteins in the Rsp5 signaling network. Moreover, we show that Rod1 physically interacts with Hxt6 principally at the plasma membrane. Upon overexpression of either SNF1 or BMH2, the Rod1-Hxt6 complex is present, but a lower percentage of the signal is observed at the plasma membrane. Accordingly, glucose-induced Hxt6 degradation is delayed in these strains. Finally, we also demonstrate the interaction between Rod1 and Hxt1. Thus, our work provides experimental proof of the physical interaction in vivo between an ART family member and its cargo proteins, which shows specificity both at the level of environmental stimulus and subcellular localization. The Snf1 kinase was previously reported to phosphorylate the ART family protein, Rod1 (19.Shinoda J. Kikuchi Y. Rod1, an arrestin-related protein, is phosphorylated by Snf1-kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We tested whether these two proteins physically interact in a yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1, we not only detected this interaction but also mapped the regions of these proteins required for the interaction. We show that the regulatory domain of Snf1 (Snf1-RD) interacts with the N-terminal half of Rod1, which contains the arrestin-like domain. Interestingly, this is also the domain of Rod1 implicated in binding the protein phosphatase regulatory subunit, Reg1 (16.Becuwe M. Vieira N. Lara D. Gomes-Rezende J. Soares-Cunha C. Casal M.

Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We further analyzed whether this interaction was specific for Rod1 or whether other ART family members also interacted with Snf1 in this assay. As shown in Fig. 2, Snf1 interacts only with Rod1 and the closely related Rog3 (Art7) protein. No growth was observed in control strains co-transformed with the ART vectors and the empty LexA-containing vector (data not shown). Our results support previous reports showing a functional interaction between Rod1 and Snf1 and show that Rog3 may also be regulated in a similar way (16.Becuwe M. Vieira N. Lara D. Gomes-Rezende J.

Moreover, they suggest that Snf1 is not a general regulator of ART family proteins and support the idea of a partitioning of the functions of Rsp5 adaptor proteins to respond to different classes of environmental changes through protein phosphorylation by specific kinases, such as those related to carbon (Snf1-Rod1/Rog3) or nitrogen (Npr1-Art1) sources (12.MacGurn J.A.

Because we did not detect binding in this assay (data not shown) and recent reports and high throughput studies show that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Rsp5 adaptor proteins (13.Merhi A. André B.

Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis of Bmh2 with 9 ART family members to assay this interaction under different experimental conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, all ART family proteins except Aly2 (Art3) and Art5 interacted with Bmh2 under the conditions tested. We performed this assay in selective medium containing either 2% glucose (synthetic dextrose (SD) medium) or in low glucose (LG) medium, containing 0.05% glucose, 2% glycerol, 2% galactose, and 2% ethanol as the carbon source, to test responsiveness to this environmental condition (22.Sanz P. Ludin K. Carlson M. Sip5 interacts with both the Reg1/Glc7 protein phosphatase and the Snf1 protein kinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Genetics. 2000; 154: 99-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that the relative growth pattern differed in these two conditions. Although suggestive, more experiments will be required to establish the physiological relevance of these interactions. We next studied the interaction between Rod1 and Bmh2 in the presence and absence of SNF1 overexpression (Fig. 4, A–D). We employed SNF1 mutants harboring point mutants, which constitutively activate (G53R) or deactivate (K84R) the kinase (23.Jiang R. Carlson M. Glucose regulates protein interactions within the yeast SNF1 protein kinase complex.Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3105-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The proposed model suggests that Snf1 phosphorylation of Rod1 creates binding sites for 14-3-3 protein interaction. Accordingly, we should be able to detect differences in yeast two-hybrid interactions by monitoring the activity of β-galactosidase. As shown in Fig. 4C, we observe an increase in the β-galactosidase activity in strains co-expressing ROD1-AD/BMH2-DB and SNF1. Moreover, expression of a mutated version of Snf1 that is constitutively active increases the Rod1-Bmh2 interaction, whereas overexpression of a kinase-dead version of Snf1 shows a similar level of Rod1-Bmh2 interaction as the empty vector control. The growth assays shown in Fig. 4A corroborate the data obtained in the β-galactosidase assays. These results complement the existing data used to propose the model presented by Becuwe et al. (16.Becuwe M. Vieira N. Lara D. Gomes-Rezende J. Soares-Cunha C. Casal M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. Vincent O. Paiva S. Léon S. A molecular switch on an arrestin-like protein relays glucose signaling to transporter endocytosis.J. Cell Biol. 2012; 196: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) for the regulation of the Jen1 lactate transporter, where they showed a reduction in the amount of Rod1 present in a Bmh2-GST pulldown in strains lacking SNF1. Our data show that the kinase activity of Snf1 is required for the increase in Rod1-Bmh2 interaction. Interestingly, we did not see any difference in these assays when we used a mutant form of Rod1 lacking the previously identified Snf1 phosphorylation site at serine 447 (data not shown), suggesting that this assay is not sensitive enough to detect this change or that other phosphorylation sites are also involved in 14-3-3 binding (19.Shinoda J. Kikuchi Y. Rod1, an arrestin-related protein, is phosphorylated by Snf1-kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 364: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To further clarify this point, we checked the interaction between Bmh2 and the N- and C-terminal parts of Rod1. As shown in Fig. 4D, we observed an interaction between Bmh2 and the N-terminal domain of Rod1 (amino acids 1–395), suggesting that that serine 447 is not likely to be the only phosphorylation site involved in the Bmh2-Rod1 interaction. We were next interested in studying the physical interaction between Rod1 and the Hxt6 hexose transporter. Previous studies have shown that Rod1 is necessary for the down-regulation of Hxt6 when cells are shifted from raffinose to glucose-containing medium (11.Nikko E. Pelham H.R. Arrestin-mediated endocytosis of yeast plasma membrane transporters.Traffic. 2009; 10: 1856-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). At least two studies have presented different experimental evidence showing that ART family members bind directly to transporter proteins (9.Hatakeyama R. Kamiya M. Takahara T. Maeda T. Endocytosis of the aspartic acid/glutamic acid transporter Dip5 is triggered by substrate-dependent recruitment of the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase via the arrestin-like protein Aly2.Mol. Cell.

However, in these cases, in vivo interactions in live cells were not reported, nor were the subcellular localization of the complexes. Here, we show both by co-immunoprecipitation and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) that Rod1 physically interacts with Hxt6 (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Specifically, in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we observe an increase in the amount of Rod1 that binds to Hxt6 in cells treated with glucose for 30 min, as compared with those grown in raffinose. Moreover, we also detect more Rod1 in the Hxt6 immunoprecipitate both before treatment and in glucose-treated cells overexpressing SNF1 or BMH2 (Fig. 5).FIGURE 6Visualization of the Rod1-Hxt6 complex in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. The HXT6-VC::HIS3 strain was transformed with the ROD1-VN or the empty plasmid, and the wild type strain was co-transformed with the VC empty plasmid and the ROD1-VN, as indicated. The cells were grown to mid-log phase in raffinose medium. A, images of the BiFC fluorescence and the overlay with the transmitted light are shown. B and C, the HXT6-VC::HIS3 strain expressing ROD1-VN was co-transformed with the endocytic vesicle marker DsRed-FYVE (B) or the TGN marker DsRed-Sec7 (C). Strains were grown to mid-log phase in raffinose medium and transferred to raffinose (RAF) or glucose (GLU) medium without methionine for 30 min to induce the expression of Rod1. The cells were visualized by confocal microscopy as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” D, the HXT6-VC::HIS3 strain expressing ROD1-VN was grown to mid-log phase in raffinose medium, incubated with 2 μg/ml FM4-64 for 60 min, washed, resuspended in glucose medium without methionine, and visualized by confocal microscopy 60 min later. Representative cells are shown. Identical results were obtained for at least two independent transformants and in at least two experiments. E, the plasma membrane fluorescence/internal fluorescence ratio was calculated from the data described in B and C (a total of 126 untreated and 88 treated cells were quantified).

The whiskers denote the maximal and minimal fluorescence intensities (p value < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using the BiFC assay, which is capable of detecting and determining the subcellular localization of protein-protein interactions in live cells, we demonstrate that a Rod1-Hxt6 complex can be detected principally at the cell surface in cells growing in raffinose as the sole carbon source. Importantly, no fluorescence was detected in either of the control combinations (Hxt6-VC/VN or VC/Rod1-VN; Fig. 6A). Using both FM4-64 treatments and co-localization studies with endosomal (FYVE-DsRed) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Sec7-DsRed) markers (24.Proszynski T.J. Klemm R.W. Gravert M. Hsu P.P. Gloor Y.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17981-17986Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we show that this signal partially co-localizes with endocytic vesicles and the vacuole (Fig. 6, B–D). Upon glucose treatment, we observe decrease in the plasma membrane fluorescence/internal fluorescence ratio, consistent with the vacuolar degradation of the complex (Fig. 6E). The vacuolar signal observed is likely to be a result of the permanent reconstitution of the Venus protein upon Hxt6-Rod1 interaction. Further studies are required to determine whether Rod1 travels with Hxt6 to the vacuole for degradation. In any case, to our knowledge these results represent the first observation of the interaction in vivo between a yeast α-arrestin and its cargo protein. We next studied the interaction between Rod1 and the Hxt1 hexose transporter, which was recently identified to be regulated by this α-arrestin in response to 2-deoxyglucose treatment (15.O'Donnell A.F. McCartney R.R. Chandrashekarappa D.G. Zhang B.B. Thorner J. Schmidt M.C. 2-Deoxyglucose impairs Saccharomyces cerevisiae growth by stimulating Snf1-regulated and α-arrestin-mediated trafficking of hexose transporters 1 and 3.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2015; 35: 939-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 7, the weak Rod1-Hxt1 BiFC signal appears internally independent of the carbon source. No fluorescence was observed with either control combination (Hxt1-VC/VN or VC/Rod1-VN; Fig. 7A). Upon 2-deoxyglucose treatment, a strong interaction is detected in punctate structures that co-localize with the FYVE domain containing endocytic marker, but not the Sec7 TGN marker. It is interesting to note that we very rarely observed the interaction at the cell surface regardless of the carbon source or treatments employed, which is in stark contrast to that observed in the case of Hxt6-Rod1. These data suggest additional levels of control of spatial and temporal specificity of the interaction between α-arrestins and their cargo proteins. Because the BiFC experiments described above for Hxt6-Rod1 were performed with a plasmid-borne version of Rod1, we performed a BiFC analysis with genomically integrated fusion proteins so that both fusion proteins would be under the control of their own promoter. We consider this analysis to be crucial to avoid misinterpretations because of overexpression of the proteins involved in complex formation and because our experiments and previous studies have shown that Rod1 protein accumulation and post-translational modifications are regulated by carbon source (Fig. 8A and Refs. 16.Becuwe M.

https://openalex.org/W2412531419,"Federal funding for basic scientific research is the cornerstone of societal progress, economy, health and well-being. There is a direct relationship between financial investment in science and a nation’s scientific discoveries, making it a priority for governments to distribute public funding appropriately in support of the best science. However, research grant proposal success rate and funding level can be skewed toward certain groups of applicants, and such skew may be driven by systemic bias arising during grant proposal evaluation and scoring. Policies to best redress this problem are not well established. Here, we show that funding success and grant amounts for applications to Canada’s Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant program (2011–2014) are consistently lower for applicants from small institutions. This pattern persists across applicant experience levels, is consistent among three criteria used to score grant proposals, and therefore is interpreted as representing systemic bias targeting applicants from small institutions. When current funding success rates are projected forward, forecasts reveal that future science funding at small schools in Canada will decline precipitously in the next decade, if skews are left uncorrected. We show that a recently-adopted pilot program to bolster success by lowering standards for select applicants from small institutions will not erase funding skew, nor will several other post-evaluation corrective measures. Rather, to support objective and robust review of grant applications, it is necessary for research councils to address evaluation skew directly, by adopting procedures such as blind review of research proposals and bibliometric assessment of performance. Such measures will be important in restoring confidence in the objectivity and fairness of science funding decisions. Likewise, small institutions can improve their research success by more strongly supporting productive researchers and developing competitive graduate programming opportunities."

Design Retrospective, single institution study. Subjects 120 eyes of 60 children with bilateral retinoblastoma treated since March 2008. Methods Retrospective review of all children treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering with bilateral ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (Melphalan, Carboplatin, Topotecan, Methotrexate) delivered in the same initial session to both naïve and previously treated eyes. Main Outcome Measures Ocular survival, metastatic disease, patient survival from metastases, second cancers, systemic adverse effects, need for transfusion of blood products, electroretinogram before and after treatment. Results 116 eyes were salvaged (4 eyes were enucleated: 3 because of progressive disease, 1 family choice). Kaplan Meier ocular survival was 99.2% at one year, 96.9% at 2 and 3 years and 94.9% for years 4 through 7. There were no cases of metastatic disease or metastatic deaths with a mean follow-up of 3.01 years. Two children developed second cancers (both pineoblastoma) and one of them died. Transfusion of blood products was required in 3 cases (4 transfusions), 1.9%. Two children developed fever/neutropenia requiring hospitalization (0.95%). ERGs were improved in 21.6% and unchanged after treatment in 52.5% of cases (increase or decrease of less than 25μV). Conclusions Bilateral ophthalmic artery chemosurgery is a safe and effective technique for managing bilateral retinoblastoma-even when eyes are advanced bilaterally, and if both eyes have progressed after systemic chemotherapy. Ocular survival was excellent (94.9% at 8 years), there were no cases of of metastatic disease and no deaths from metastatic disease, but children remain at risk for second cancers. In 21.6% of cases ERG function improved. Despite using chemotherapy in both eyes in the same session, systemic toxicity was low."
https://openalex.org/W2435667967,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biological process of metastatic cancer. However, an effective anticancer therapy that directly targets the EMT program has not yet been discovered. Recent studies have indicated that mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET), the reverse phenomenon of EMT, is observed in fibroblasts during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of reprogramming factors (RFs) on squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. RFs-introduced cancer cells (RICs) demonstrated the enhanced epithelial characteristics in morphology with altered expression of mRNA and microRNAs. The motility and invasive activities of RICs in vitro were significantly reduced. Furthermore, xenografts of RICs exhibited no lymph node metastasis, whereas metastasis was detected in parental SCC-inoculated mice. Thus, we concluded that RICs regained epithelial properties through MET and showed reduced cancer malignancy in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the understanding of the MET process in cancer cells by introduction of RFs may lead to the designing of a novel anticancer strategy."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether such mechanisms are preserved in PD patients despite an altered pattern of locomotion. We consecutively enrolled 23 PD patients (mean age 64±9 years) with bilateral symptoms (H&Y ≥II) if able to walk unassisted in medication-off condition (overnight suspension of all dopaminergic drugs). Ten healthy subjects (mean age 62±3 years) walked both at their ‘preferred’ and ‘slow’ speeds, to match the whole range of PD velocities. Kinematic data were recorded by means of an optoelectronic motion analyzer. For each stride we computed spatio-temporal parameters, time-course and range of motion (ROM) of hip, knee and ankle joint angles. We also measured kinetic (Wk), potential (Wp), total (WtotCM) energy variations and the energy recovery index (ER). Along with PD progression, we found a significant correlation of WtotCM and Wp with knee ROM and in particular with knee extension in terminal stance phase. Wk and ER were instead mainly related to gait velocity. In PD subjects, the reduction of knee ROM significantly diminished both Wp and WtotCM. Rehabilitation treatments should possibly integrate passive and active mobilization of knee to prevent a reduction of gait-related energetic components."

This in-depth analysis of a complex miRNA regulatory program in intestinal epithelial cell models provides novel evidence that the miR-30 family likely plays an important role in IEC homeostasis. The intestinal epithelium is vital for a wide range of physiological functions, including pathogen defense, nutrient absorption, and metabolic homeostasis. It is also the most rapidly renewing tissue in the body, with cellular turnover occurring every 3–5 days in humans. This rate is dependent on the stability of intestinal epithelial stem cells, which give rise to transit amplifying progenitor cells that go on to differentiate into various types of mature IECs, such as enterocytes, enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells, and goblet cells. Precise regulation of gene expression in these cell types is vital for the proper balance between proliferation and differentiation in the intestinal epithelium. miRNAs 2The abbreviations used are: miRNAmicroRNAIECintestinal epithelial cellLNAlocked nucleic acidHIEChuman intestinal epithelial cellCPMcounts per millionFC-fold changeFDRfalse discovery rateRQVrelative quantitative value. are prominent members of gene regulatory networks and are known for their roles in buffering and fine-tuning target gene expression (1Tsang J.

Notably, varying levels of Sox9 have been shown to mark functionally distinct cell types of the mouse intestinal epithelium. Accordingly, a transgenic reporter mouse (Sox9-EGFP) has been developed to identify and isolate both differentiated cell types and actively cycling intestinal epithelial stem cells and progenitors based on the levels of cellular EGFP expression driven by the Sox9 promoter (20Gracz A.D.

For example, miR-145 has been shown to target SOX9 in various cancer subtypes (25Dynoodt P. Speeckaert R. De Wever O. Chevolet I. Brochez L. Lambert J.

Because both miRNA expression and mRNA 3′-UTR usage can vary across cell types and conditions, these findings are not necessarily generalizable to the intestinal epithelium. To date no study has investigated miRNA-mediated regulation of SOX9 in the context of IECs. More importantly, roles of specific miRNAs in the control of intestinal epithelial proliferation and differentiation are poorly characterized. In this study, we work toward bridging this knowledge gap using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses. We carried out a bioinformatic strategy using TargetScan6.2 (30Lewis B.P. Burge C.B.

We identified putative target sites for nine miRNA families. To narrow this list of possible miRNA regulators of SOX9 in the intestinal epithelium, we analyzed the only data set of publically available small RNA sequencing data from mouse intestinal mucosa (4McKenna L.B. Schug J. Vourekas A. McKenna J.B. Bramswig N.C. Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. et al.MicroRNAs control intestinal epithelial differentiation, architecture, and barrier function.Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 1654-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Only four miRNA families were expressed at a minimum of 10 reads/million mapped: miR-145, miR-101, miR-320, and miR-30 (Fig. 1a). Of these, miR-30 has the strongest predicted base pairing with SOX9, consisting of an 8-mer seed as well as supplementary 3′-end pairing for two of the family members. Moreover, the miR-30 target site and flanking ∼15 bases are highly conserved among most mammals including human, rodent, dog, opossum, and horse, as well as distant vertebrates such as lizard. Because the intestinal mucosa includes diverse cell types not limited to epithelia, we next sought to evaluate the expression of the members of these four miRNA families across four main epithelial cell types. Specifically, we sorted functionally distinct IECs by FACS from the jejunum of female conventionally raised Sox9-EGFP mice. This model allows for the isolation of four populations based on cellular EGFP, including enteroendocrine cells (Sox9High), intestinal epithelial stem cells (Sox9Low), transit amplifying cells (Sox9Sublow), and differentiated enterocytes and Paneth and goblet cells (Sox9Negative). We then performed RT-PCR for each of the four miRNA families across each IEC population. miR-101 and miR-145 were very lowly expressed, indeed barely detected, in any cell type of the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 1b). It is worth noting that although miR-145 was reported to have robust expression in the study by McKenna et al. (4McKenna L.B. Schug J. Vourekas A. McKenna J.B. Bramswig N.C. Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. et al.MicroRNAs control intestinal epithelial differentiation, architecture, and barrier function.Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 1654-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) of the entire intestinal mucosa, it was recently demonstrated that miR-145 is specific to mesenchymal cells in the intestine (34Chivukula R.R. Shi G. Acharya A. Mills E.W. Zeitels L.R. Anandam J.L. Abdelnaby A.A. Balch G.C. Mansour J.C. Yopp A.C. Maitra A. Mendell J.T. et al.An essential mesenchymal function for miR-143/145 in intestinal epithelial regeneration.Cell. 2014; 157: 1104-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). By using FACS, we obtain a highly pure epithelial population, whereas the earlier data from McKenna et al. (4McKenna L.B. Schug J. Vourekas A. McKenna J.B. Bramswig N.C. Friedman J.R. Kaestner K.H. et al.MicroRNAs control intestinal epithelial differentiation, architecture, and barrier function.Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 1654-1664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) were generated using an intestinal scraping method, which could lead to some mesenchymal, lymphatic, and/or vascular contamination. Based on these differences, we conclude that it is likely that both miR-145 and miR-101 are robustly expressed in a non-epithelial mucosal tissue, but not in IECs. In contrast, members of the miR-30 family and miR-320a showed robust expression in IECs (Fig. 1b). Moreover, only miR-30 family members exhibited differential expression across functionally distinct IECs, leading us to select this miRNA family for follow-up analyses. To evaluate miR-30 regulation of SOX9 in IECs, we knocked down miR-30 expression using locked nucleic acids complementary to miR-30b, miR-30c, and miR-30d (LNA30bcd), in human intestinal epithelial cells (HIECs). Upon knockdown of these miR-30 family members, we observed a significant increase in SOX9 mRNA at 48 and 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2a), which is consistent with alleviation of negative post-transcriptional regulation of SOX9 by miR-30. However, we unexpectedly found that SOX9 protein was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 2, a and b). In fact, SOX9 mRNA and protein expression were strongly inversely correlated (Pearson's r = −0.93, p = 0.006; Fig. 2a) across three time points post-transfection with LNA30bcd. We confirmed that this inverse relationship between SOX9 mRNA and protein exists in a second intestinal cell culture model, Caco-2 (Fig. 2b), indicating that the finding is not unique to HIECs. To test for a direct relationship between miR-30 and the SOX9 3′-UTR, we performed a luciferase reporter assay in Caco-2 cells. We observed increased relative luciferase activity in cells transfected with 100 nm LNA30bcd (Fig. 2d), consistent with direct targeting of SOX9 by miR-30 that has been previously shown in cartilage (35Chang T. Xie J. Li H. Li D. Liu P. Hu Y. et al.MicroRNA-30a promotes extracellular matrix degradation in articular cartilage via downregulation of Sox9.Cell Prolif. 2016; 49: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the opposite effect of miR-30 inhibition on SOX9 mRNA and protein levels could be due to miR-30-mediated regulation of factors that modify SOX9 protein stability without affecting SOX9 RNA levels, such as post-translational modifiers (Fig. 2e). To evaluate this hypothesis, we next sought to define the regulatory program that miR-30 directs in HIECs and to identify potential miR-30 targets that may be regulating SOX9 protein levels. Specifically, we performed next generation high throughput RNA sequencing on total RNA isolated from mock and LNA30bcd transfected HIECs at three time points (see “Experimental Procedures”). Following read alignment and transcript quantification, we identified differentially expressed genes using edgeR (36Robinson M.D. McCarthy D.J. Smyth G.K. et al.edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data.Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21051) Google Scholar). To avoid bias from lowly expressed genes, we filtered out genes that did not reach an expression threshold of 10 counts per million (CPM) in at least three of the samples. A total of 10,096 genes were included in our analysis. We first normalized gene counts using the generalized linear model in edgeR to account for both the treatment and time variables in our experimental design. Samples were tightly clustered by treatment and time point according to multidimensional scaling, principal components, and hierarchical clustering analyses (Fig. 3, a–c). Notably, cells treated with 100 nm LNA30bcd at 24 h post-transfection clustered with mock transfected samples (Fig. 3c). However, cells treated with 100 nm LNA30bcd at 48 and 72 h post-transfection clustered into a distinct subclade, indicating that the regulatory effect of LNA30bcd was greatest at the later time points. Next, we performed differential expression analysis and found that half of all genes (50.1% or 5055) included in the analysis are significantly differentially expressed (FC ± 1.5 and FDR < 0.05) between mock and LNA30bcd transfected cells in at least one time point post-transfection (Fig. 4, a–c, and supplemental Table S1). Notably, although SOX9 was found to be up-regulated as expected by LNA30bcd treatment at 72 h post-transfection, it was certainly not the most robustly or significantly altered gene (Fig. 4d).FIGURE 4.LNA30bcd-treated HIECs undergo robust changes in gene expression over a 3-day time course. a, Venn diagram showing significantly down-regulated genes (fold change or FC < −1.5, FDR < 0.05) across time points in HIECs after 100 nm LNA30bcd transfection compared with mock transfection. b, Venn diagram showing significantly up-regulated genes (FC > 1.5, FDR < 0.05) across time points in HIECs after 100 nm LNA30bcd transfection compared with mock transfection. c, bar graph showing the number of significantly down-regulated and up-regulated genes across time points. d, volcano plot showing differentially expressed genes at 72 h.

We found that both highly conserved and species-specific predicted miR-30 targets sites were significantly enriched (p < 0.05) in genes up-regulated at both 48 and 72 h post-transfection, but as expected not in down-regulated genes (Fig. 4e). At 24 h post-transfection, predicted miR-30 target sites were not enriched. Together, these data suggest that our knockdown of miR-30 using LNA30bcd was specific and highly effective in HIECs, particularly in the later time points of our study. To identify genes that might act as post-translational regulators of SOX9 protein in response to LNA30bcd treatment, we performed Gene Ontology Molecular Function enrichment analysis (40Gene Ontology ConsortiumGene Ontology Consortium: going forward.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D1049-D1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar, 41Ashburner M.

Only three terms were identified as being significantly enriched (adjusted p value < 0.05; Fig. 5, a and b) at any time point in the up-regulated gene sets. Interestingly, these included “ubiquitin-protein transferase activity” and “ligase activity.” Ubiquitin ligase-mediated regulation of SOX9 has been shown previously in chondrocytes (43Hattori T. Kishino T. Stephen S. Eberspaecher H. Maki S. Takigawa M. de Crombrugghe B. Yasuda H. et al.E6-AP/UBE3A protein acts as a ubiquitin ligase toward SOX9 protein.J. Biol.

To evaluate whether miR-30 influences ubiquitin ligase-mediated degradation of SOX9 protein, we subjected Caco-2 cells to either mock or LNA30bcd transfection and then treated them with vehicle or MG132, a potent proteasome inhibitor. We found that MG132 treatment for 4 h was sufficient to rescue SOX9 protein expression following LNA30bcd treatment (Fig. 5c). This suggests that miR-30 is able to regulate SOX9 protein expression through post-transcriptional regulation of ubiquitin ligases (Fig. 5d). Based on previous work, altered levels of SOX9 are expected to lead to changes in the balanc"
https://openalex.org/W2415700736,"Chinese herbal medicine image recognition and retrieval have great potential of practical applications. Several previous studies have focused on the recognition with hand-crafted image features, but there are two limitations in them. Firstly, most of these hand-crafted features are low-level image representation, which is easily affected by noise and background. Secondly, the medicine images are very clean without any backgrounds, which makes it difficult to use in practical applications. Therefore, designing high-level image representation for recognition and retrieval in real world medicine images is facing a great challenge. Inspired by the recent progress of deep learning in computer vision, we realize that deep learning methods may provide robust medicine image representation. In this paper, we propose to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Chinese herbal medicine image recognition and retrieval. For the recognition problem, we use the softmax loss to optimize the recognition network; then for the retrieval problem, we fine-tune the recognition network by adding a triplet loss to search for the most similar medicine images. To evaluate our method, we construct a public database of herbal medicine images with cluttered backgrounds, which has in total 5523 images with 95 popular Chinese medicine categories. Experimental results show that our method can achieve the average recognition precision of 71% and the average retrieval precision of 53% over all the 95 medicine categories, which are quite promising given the fact that the real world images have multiple pieces of occluded herbal and cluttered backgrounds. Besides, our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance by improving previous studies with a large margin."

Breeding status of SNF wolves were assessed via nipple measurements, and wolves from throughout MN wolf range, by placental scars. In the SNF, proportions of currently breeding females (those breeding in the year sampled) ranged from 19% at age 2 to 80% at age 5, and from throughout wolf range, from 33% at age 2 to 100% at age 7. Excluding pups and yearlings, only 33% to 36% of SNF females and 58% of females from throughout MN wolf range bred in any given year. Generation time for SNF wolves was 4.3 years and for MN wolf range, 4.7 years. These findings will be useful in modeling wolf population dynamics and in wolf genetic and dog-domestication studies."

In this study, we profiled its primary and secondary metabolites, as well as hormones of embryogenic and non-embryogenic (dry and watery) callus and shoot base, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry together with histological characterization. Metabolite profiling showed relatively higher levels of glutamine, arginine and lysine in embryogenic callus than in dry and watery calli, while shoot base tissue showed an intermediate level of primary metabolites. For the five secondary metabolites analyzed (ie. panduratin, pinocembrin, pinostrobin, cardamonin and alpinetin), shoot base had the highest concentrations, followed by watery, dry and embryogenic calli. Furthermore, intracellular auxin levels were found to decrease from dry to watery calli, followed by shoot base and finally embryogenic calli. Our morphological observations showed the presence of fibrils on the cell surface of embryogenic callus while diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethylester staining indicated the presence of flavonoids in both dry and embryogenic calli. Periodic acid-Schiff staining showed that shoot base and dry and embryogenic calli contained starch reserves while none were found in watery callus. This study identified several primary metabolites that could be used as markers of embryogenic cells in B. rotunda, while secondary metabolite analysis indicated that biosynthesis pathways of these important metabolites may not be active in callus and embryogenic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2413835184,"All animals are infected by microbial partners that can be passengers or residents and influence many biological traits of their hosts. Even if important factors that structure the composition and abundance of microbial communities within and among host individuals have been recently described, such as diet, developmental stage or phylogeny, few studies have conducted cross-taxonomic comparisons, especially on host species related by trophic relationships. Here, we describe and compare the microbial communities associated with the cabbage root fly Delia radicum and its three major parasitoids: the two staphylinid beetles Aleochara bilineata and A. bipustulata and the hymenopteran parasitoid Trybliographa rapae. For each species, two populations from Western France were sampled and microbial communities were described through culture independent methods (454 pyrosequencing). Each sample harbored at least 59 to 261 different bacterial phylotypes but was strongly dominated by one or two. Microbial communities differed markedly in terms of composition and abundance, being mainly influenced by phylogenetic proximity but also geography to a minor extent. Surprisingly, despite their strong trophic interaction, parasitoids shared a very low proportion of microbial partners with their insect host. Three vertically transmitted symbionts from the genus Wolbachia, Rickettsia, and Spiroplasma were found in this study. Among them, Wolbachia and Spiroplasma were found in both the cabbage fly and at least one of its parasitoids, which could result from horizontal transfers through trophic interactions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this hypothesis may explain some but not all cases. More work is needed to understand the dynamics of symbiotic associations within trophic network and the effect of these bacterial communities on the fitness of their hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2410864000,"Semaphorin family proteins act on cells to mediate both repulsive and attractive guidance via binding to plexin family receptors, thereby playing fundamental roles in the morphogenesis and homeostasis of various tissues. Although semaphorin-plexin signaling is implicated in various diseases and is thus a target of intensive research, our mechanistic understanding of how semaphorins activate plexins on the cell surface is limited. Here, we describe unique anti-plexin-A1 antibodies that can induce a collapsed morphology in mouse dendritic cells as efficiently as the semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) ligand. Precise epitope analysis indicates that these ""semaphorin-mimicking"" antibodies dimerize cell-surface plexin-A1 by binding to the N-terminal sema domain of the plexin at sites away from the interface used by the Sema3A ligand. Structural analysis of plexin-A1 fragments using negative stain electron microscopy further revealed that this agonistic capacity is closely linked to the location and orientation of antibody binding. In addition, the full-length plexin-A1 ectodomain exhibited a highly curved ""C"" shape, reinforcing the very unusual dimeric receptor conformation of this protein at the cell surface when engaged with Sema3A or agonistic antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2415489310,"Protein misfolding is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, where mutations of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) account for about 20% of the inherited mutations. Human SOD1 (hSOD1) contains four cysteines, including Cys57 and Cys146, which have been linked to protein stability and folding via forming a disulfide bond, and Cys6 and Cys111 as free thiols. But the roles of the cellular oxidation-reduction (redox) environment in SOD1 folding and aggregation are not well understood. Here we explore the effects of cellular redox systems on the aggregation of hSOD1 proteins. We found that the known hSOD1 mutations G93A and A4V increased the capability of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems to reduce hSOD1 compared with wild-type hSOD1. Treatment with inhibitors of these redox systems resulted in an increase of hSOD1 aggregates in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with mutants but not in cells transfected with wild-type hSOD1 or those containing a secondary C111G mutation. This aggregation may be coupled to changes in the redox state of the G93A and A4V mutants upon mild oxidative stress. These results strongly suggest that the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems are the key regulators for hSOD1 aggregation and may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ALS. Protein misfolding is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, where mutations of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) account for about 20% of the inherited mutations. Human SOD1 (hSOD1) contains four cysteines, including Cys57 and Cys146, which have been linked to protein stability and folding via forming a disulfide bond, and Cys6 and Cys111 as free thiols. But the roles of the cellular oxidation-reduction (redox) environment in SOD1 folding and aggregation are not well understood. Here we explore the effects of cellular redox systems on the aggregation of hSOD1 proteins. We found that the known hSOD1 mutations G93A and A4V increased the capability of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems to reduce hSOD1 compared with wild-type hSOD1. Treatment with inhibitors of these redox systems resulted in an increase of hSOD1 aggregates in the cytoplasm of cells transfected with mutants but not in cells transfected with wild-type hSOD1 or those containing a secondary C111G mutation. This aggregation may be coupled to changes in the redox state of the G93A and A4V mutants upon mild oxidative stress. These results strongly suggest that the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems are the key regulators for hSOD1 aggregation and may play critical roles in the pathogenesis of ALS. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease in which the main feature is a loss of motoneurons and muscle atrophy. About 10% of cases are inherited and described as familial form of ALS (fALS). 4The abbreviations used are: fALSfamilial ALSSODsuperoxide dismutaseredoxreduction-oxidationTrxthioredoxinGrxglutaredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseGRglutathione reductasehSODhuman superoxide dismutaseATGaurothioglucoseBSObuthionine sulfoximineROSreactive oxygen species. fALS is associated with mutations in the genes C9orf72, SOD1, TDP-43, and FUS, with C9orf72 being the most prevalent and followed by SOD1 (1Seetharaman S.V.

In fact, the first reported gene related to fALS is Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) (4Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P.

SOD1 is a cytosolic ubiquitous enzyme that scavenges superoxide radicals in every cell type of the human body, including erythrocytes (1Seetharaman S.V. Prudencio M. Karch C. Holloway S.P. Borchelt D.R. Hart P.J. Immature copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Exp. Biol.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 563-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). However, mutations induce exclusively cell death of motoneurons and, to a lesser extent, other neurons (10Ilieva H. Polymenidou M. Cleveland D.W. Non-cell autonomous toxicity in neurodegenerative disorders: ALS and beyond.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In a metal-coordinated state, SOD1 forms a homodimer to accomplish its full enzymatic activity. Copper is necessary for the enzymatic activity, whereas zinc mainly works in maintaining the protein structure (5Valentine J.S. Doucette P.A. Zittin Potter S. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 563-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). A conformational change in mutant SOD1 may increase the accessibility of other substrates to copper in the protein to generate reactive oxygen or nitrogen species. Because most mutations associated so far with fALS do not show a reduction in SOD1 enzymatic activity, it has been postulated that the deleterious action of mutated SOD1 is probably due to a gain of toxic function rather than the expected increase in the concentration of free radicals (4Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene are associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). Several cellular mechanisms, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, NMDA-mediated excitoxicity, altered axonal transport, proteasome inhibition, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and so on have been suggested to initiate and promote neuronal death (2Kiernan M.C.

A hallmark in neurodegenerative disease is the presence of protein aggregates in the nervous tissue of patients. Indeed, SOD1 makes aggregates in the spinal cord of fALS patients and transgenic mice mimicking ALS-carrying mutations of SOD1 (8Wang J. Farr G.W. Zeiss C.J. Rodriguez-Gil D.J. Wilson J.H. Furtak K.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 1392-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although it is not fully clear whether the aggregates are toxic or represent a kind of self-inactivation system, it is well known that they are the results of protein misfolding (12Goodall E.F. Morrison K.E. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (motor neuron disease): proposed mechanisms and pathways to treatment.Expert Rev. Mol. Med. 2006; 8: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Metals are essential for the correct folding of SOD1. The apoenzyme is prone to aggregation (13Tiwari A. Liba A. Sohn S.H. Seetharaman S.V. Bilsel O. Matthews C.R. Hart P.J. Valentine J.S.

Chem. 2009; 284: 27746-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additionally, cysteines have been implicated to be involved in aggregation. SOD1 mutants are susceptible to have more aggregation propensity (14Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R.

According to the crystal structure of SOD1, there is an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys57 and Cys146 (Fig. 1). When cysteines were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis to other amino acids, the intracellular SOD1 aggregates decreased (18Tiwari A. Hayward L.J.

Cys111 is located on the surface of the molecule, where it can be oxidized, changing the molecular conformation of the protein (Fig. 1) (21Bosco D.A. Morfini G. Karabacak N.M. Song Y. Gros-Louis F.

The quaternary structure and stability of SOD1 are controlled by the intramolecular disulfide bond. The equilibrium between oxidized and reduced forms of the disulfide bond of SOD1 should be highly dependent on the redox potential of the cytosolic environment, which is mainly controlled by Trx or Grx systems (23Holmgren A. Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Trx system is composed of NADPH, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and Trx, whereas the Grx system is composed of NADPH, glutathione reductase (GR) and GSH, and Grx (23Holmgren A. Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lu J. Holmgren A. The thioredoxin antioxidant system.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2014; 66: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). Changes in the cytoplasmic redox potential would influence the reduction or the oxidation of the disulfide bond of WT or mutant SOD1 proteins, rendering reactive free cysteines that could interact with thiol groups of other molecules forming new aggregates. Human Grx1 was reported to be able to reduce apo-hSOD1 (25Bouldin S.D. Darch M.A. Hart P.J. Outten C.E.

Fiorenzo P. Nencini M. Cozzolino M. Pesaresi M.G. Valle C. Sepe S. Moreno S. Carrì M.T. Glutaredoxin 2 prevents aggregation of mutant SOD1 in mitochondria and abolishes its toxicity.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 4529-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using force-clamp atomic force spectroscopy, we have shown previously that a nucleophilic attack of Cys111 toward either Cys57 or Cys146 in a SOD1 single molecule can occur. The reactivity of Cys111 toward the conserved disulfide bond in WT and G93A or A4V mutant SOD1 is different (28Solsona C. Kahn T.B. Badilla C.L. Álvarez-Zaldiernas C. Blasi J. Fernandez J.M. Alegre-Cebollada J. Altered thiol chemistry in human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked mutants of superoxide dismutase 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 26722-26732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our aim here is to investigate the effects of the Trx and Grx systems on the redox state of wild-type and G93A and A4V mutant hSOD1 to evaluate the contribution of cellular redox environment change to SOD1 aggregation and ALS progression. To detect whether the mutations in ALS-linked SOD1 affect the susceptibility of SOD1 to reductants, we investigated the reduction of the WT and mutants G93A and A4V of hSOD1 by the GSH-Grx and Trx systems (Fig. 2A). When native oxidized hSOD1 (Fig. 2A, lane 6) was incubated with strong reductants, including a high concentration of GSH (10 mm) (Fig. 2A, lane 1) or DTT (10 mm) (Fig. 2A, lane 11) the proteins were fully reduced, which is consistent with a previous report (25Bouldin S.D. Darch M.A. Hart P.J. Outten C.E. Redox properties of the disulfide bond of human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase and the effects of human glutaredoxin 1.Biochem. J. 2012; 446: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A lower concentration of GSH (1 mm) alone could partially reduce disulfides in mutant G93A hSOD1 but not in WT hSOD1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). GR plus NADPH did not affect the redox state of SOD1 proteins and could not increase the reduction efficiency of 1 mm GSH for the oxidized WT and mutant SOD1 proteins (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). The presence of Grx1 in the GSH-Grx system enhanced the reduction of disulfide in G93A SOD1 protein. In contrast, the whole GSH-Grx system had a little reduction of disulfide in WT and A4V SOD1 proteins (Fig. 2A, lane 5). None of the oxidized SOD1 proteins were substrates of TrxR1 (Fig. 2A, lane 7); only the whole Trx system could reduce them. The Trx system reduced the oxidized A4V and G93A mutant SOD1 proteins efficiently but only gave a slight reduction for oxidized WT hSOD1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–10). Increasing the concentration of Trx1 did not enhance the reduction capacity (Fig. 2A, lanes 8–10). Mutation of SOD1 did not result in significant SOD1 activity change (Fig. 2B). The activities of recombinant proteins hSOD1 were 5.6 ± 0.6 units/μg for WT, 4.3 ± 1.8 units/μg for G93A, and 8.3 ± 1.4 units/μg for A4V, respectively. The presence of thiol-dependent redox systems did not change the enzymatic activity of hSOD1. Neither GSH nor the individual reductants of the Trx system affected the SOD1 activity of the G93A or A4V mutants (data not shown). To explore whether the Trx and GSH-Grx systems are key regulators of the aggregation of hSOD1 in cells, we generated RT4-D6P2T schwannoma cells stably expressing hSOD1-GFP fusion proteins to visualize their cellular location. We used aurothioglucose (ATG) to inhibit the cytosolic TrxR1 and buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which blocks the synthesis of GSH in cells, to see the effect of the Trx and Grx systems on SOD1 aggregation. Three different fluorescent cells, WT hSOD1-GFP, G93A hSOD1-GFP, and A4V hSOD1-GFP, were used to observe insoluble protein accumulations (Fig. 3A). Under resting conditions, fluorescence is spread over the cytoplasm (Fig. 3B, top panels). In all untreated cells, very few fluorescent bright spots in the cytoplasm were observed (Fig. 3B, top panels). ATG inhibits TrxR1 by targeting the essential selenocysteine residue, and BSO blocks GSH synthesis by inhibiting glutathione synthase, and thus treatment with 100 μm ATG or BSO for 24 h caused an alteration of the reducing capacity of the Trx and GSH systems, respectively. These treatments did not affect cell viability (data not shown). Using a confocal microscope, no remarkable morphologic changes were observed in the WT hSOD1-GFP cell line. In contrast, in cells overexpressing G93A hSOD1-GFP and A4V hSOD1-GFP, we detected condensed GFP fluorescent spots, mostly spherical, with sizes ranging from 0.2–20 μm2 and apparently located in the cytoplasm with no special distribution (Fig. 3B, center and bottom panels). The cells were analyzed with confocal florescence microscopy at a higher magnification (×400) to see the contents of the aggregates in cells (Fig. 3C). In WT cells, treatment with ATG did not show any increase in the aggregate amount, but treatment with BSO resulted in a slight increase. The aggregates in cells expressing G93A hSOD1-GFP and A4V hSOD1-GFP showed a significant increase upon treatment with BSO and ATG. These results indicated that the cellular redox environment changes that are regulated by the Trx and GSH systems are important for mutant hSOD1 aggregation in the cytoplasm. To further understand how the two cellular thiol-dependent redox systems change upon treatment with ATG and BSO, we detected protein levels of TrxR1, Trx1, and GR in the cells using Western blotting (Fig. 4). In all cells, the expression level of TrxR1 was elevated upon treatment with BSO but not in cells treated with ATG (Fig. 4, first lane). No significant differences were detected in terms of GR level in all cells (Fig. 4, fifth lane). Interestingly, treatment with BSO did not cause dramatic changes for Trx1 in cells expressing WT SOD1 but resulted in the enhancement of Trx1 in cells expressing mutant SOD1. Treatment with ATG induced an increase of Trx1 in cells overexpressing A4V SOD1 but not in cells overexpressing WT SOD1 (Fig. 4, third lane). These results indicate that the inhibition of electron transfer in one pathway may activate the expression of the other system. Cells overexpressing WT SOD1 also exhibited some difference in terms of the response to oxidative stress compared with cells expressing mutant SOD1. Because Cys111 has been shown to be a critical amino acid residue in the redox regulation of SOD1 and may affect the aggregation and formation of inclusion body-like structures of mutant SOD1 (29Roberts B.L. Patel K. Brown H.H. Borchelt D.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 866-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), we prepared stably transfected cell lines with expression of SOD1 harboring a Cys111 mutation to detect the effects of alteration of the Trx and GSH systems on SOD1 aggregation (Fig. 5). Compared with the results shown in Fig. 3, similar to cells expressing WT hSOD1, cells expressing C111G hSOD1 had little aggregates upon treatment with BSO and ATG (Fig. 5A). For cells expressing G93A and A4V mutant hSOD1, treatment with ATG or BSO showed an increase in aggregation (Fig. 3), whereas mutations in Cys111 prevented aggregate formation upon treatment with ATG and BSO in all cells (Fig. 5A, center and right panels). The amount of aggregates per cell in G93A/C111G- and A4V/C111G-expressing cells stayed at the same level upon treatment with BSO and ATG (Fig. 5B). This cumulative plot of probability of the size of hSOD1 aggregate in cells showed that treatment with BSO and ATG enlarged the probability of aggregates with a bigger area in the mutations G93A and A4V (Fig. 5C, top panels), but when Cys111 was mutated, the size of aggregates decreased in both cases and the aggregates were distributed as under untreated conditions (Fig. 5C, bottom panels). These results indicate that Cys111 in hSOD1 is a critical amino acid residue for the formation of SOD1 aggregate during thiol-dependent redox environment change. Treatment with BSO and ATG can cause a redox environment change, which may result in an alteration of ROS production. We used luminol chemiluminescence to detect the ROS level upon treatment with BSO. Superoxide reacts with luminol, which is oxidized, and light is emitted and detected (31Catz S.D. Carreras M.C. Poderoso J.J. Nitric oxide synthase inhibitors decrease human polymorphonuclear leukocyte luminol-dependent chemiluminescence.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After the treatment with BSO, the ROS level significantly increased in cells expressing WT hSOD1, C111G, A4V, and A4V/C111G (Fig. 6). In addition to studying the effects of treatment with ATG and BSO on cell morphology, we analyzed the redox state of hSOD1-GFP molecules in cells harboring single- and double-mutant hSOD1 by redox Western blotting (Fig. 7). In cells expressing WT-SOD1-GFP, there were no changes in the ratio of the reduced and oxidized form of SOD1 upon treatment with BSO or ATG. In cells expressing G93A SOD1-GFP, treatment with either BSO or ATG increased the ratio of oxidized forms (Fig. 7). In cells expressing A4V SOD1-GFP, the oxidized forms were increased significantly under both treatment conditions compared with untreated cells. We also found that mutation at Cys111 made the redox state of G93A/C111G and A4V/C111G SOD1 independent of cellular redox environment change caused by treatment with ATG or BSO (Fig. 7). To investigate whether the role of Cys111 in the hSOD1 aggregation involves the formation of disulfides, we used MS/MS to detect the disulfide formation in recombinant A4V SOD1 proteins. The protein was analyzed as purified. Besides the structural disulfide between Cys57 and Cys146, the peptide V4VCVLK9-H80VGDLGNVTADKDGVADVSIEDSVISLSGDHCIIGR114 was identified with high confidence with a 5+ precursor with a p value of 1.68e−6 and with a 6+ precursor with a p value of 8.9e−8 (Fig. 8, A and B), indicating that the disulfide of Cys6-Cys111 was formed. Fig. 8, C and D, shows the extracted ion chromatography of peptide L144ACGVIGIAQ153-H80VGDLGNVTADKDGVADVSIEDSVISLSGDHCIIGR114 and MS/MS fragmentation annotation of the higher energy collisional dissociation spectrum of the 5+ peptide, indicating that a disulfide between Cys111 and Cys146 (p = 5.25e−4) was present. In contrast, a disulfide between Cys57 and Cys146 was detected, but disulfides of Cys6-Cys111 and Cys111-Cys146 were not detected in purified recombinant WT hSOD1 protein. ALS is a complex disease in which the main targets are the cortical, brain stem, or spinal cord motoneurons. The intracellular protein aggregate of SOD1 is a hallmark character in nervous tissue of fALS patients (32Ferraiuolo L. Kirby J. Grierson A.J. Sendtner M. Shaw P.J.

Reintroducing captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders may help to augment the declining wild populations and conserve this critically endangered amphibian. We released 31 captive-reared juvenile giant salamanders implanted with VHF radio transmitters at the Heihe River (n = 15) and the Donghe River (n = 16) in the Qinling Mountains of central China. Salamanders were monitored every day for survival from April 28th 2013 to September 3rd 2014. We attempted to recapture all living individuals by the end of the study, measured their body mass and total body length, and checked for abnormalities and presence of external parasites. Two salamanders at the Heihe River and 10 animals at the Donghe River survived through the project timeline. Nine salamanders were confirmed dead, while the status of the other 10 animals was undetermined. The annual survival rate of giant salamanders at the Donghe River (0.702) was 1.7-fold higher than that at the Heihe River (0.405). Survival increased as individuals were held longer following surgery, whereas body mass did not have a significant impact on survival rate. All salamanders recaptured from the Donghe River (n = 8) increased in mass (0.50 ± 0.13 kg) and length (5.5 ± 1.5 cm) after approximately 11 months in the wild, and they were only 7% lighter than wild animals of the same length (mean residual = -0.033 ± 0.025). Our results indicate that captive-reared Chinese giant salamanders can survive in the wild one year after release and adequate surgical recovery time is extremely important to post-release survival. Future projects may reintroduce older juveniles to achieve better survival and longer monitoring duration."
https://openalex.org/W2412443584,"Objectives Definition of the optimal pneumococcal vaccine strategy in HIV-infected adults is still under evaluation. We aimed to compare immunogenicity and safety of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) versus the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) in HIV-infected adults. Methods We performed a pilot, prospective controlled study enrolling HIV-infected pneumococcal vaccine-naïve outpatients, aged 18–65 years with CD4 counts ≥200 cells/μL. Eligible subjects were recruited into two parallel groups: group 1 (n = 50) received two doses of PCV13 eight weeks apart, and group 2 (n = 50) received one dose of PPSV23, as part of their standard of care. Anti-pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide immunoglobulin G concentrations were quantified by ELISA at baseline, 8, 24 and 48 weeks. Clinical and viro-immunological follow-up was performed at the same time points. Unvaccinated, age-matched HIV-negative adults (n = 100) were also enrolled as baseline controls. Results Pre-vaccination specific IgG titers for each pneumococcal antigen did not differ between study groups but they were constantly lower than those from the HIV-negative controls. After immunization, significant increases in IgG titers were observed in both study groups at each time point compared to baseline, but response to serotype 3 was blunted in group 1. Antibody titers for each antigen did not differ between study groups at week 48. Overall, the proportion of subjects achieving seroprotection and seroconversion to all serotypes was comparable between groups. A marked decrease in IgG levels over time was observed with both vaccines. No relevant adverse reactions were reported in either group. Conclusions In this population with favorable immune profile, no relevant differences were observed in immunogenicity between PCV13 and PPSV23. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated.

https://openalex.org/W2413190891,"Background In North America, more than 800,000 youth are registered in organized ice hockey leagues. Despite the many benefits of involvement, young players are at significant risk for injury. Body-checking and aggressive play are associated with high frequency of game-related injury including concussion. We conducted a qualitative study to understand why youth ice hockey players engage in aggressive, injury-prone behaviours on the ice. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 61 minor ice hockey participants, including male and female players, parents, coaches, trainers, managers and a game official. Players were aged 13–15 playing on competitive body checking teams or on non-body checking teams. Interviews were manually transcribed, coded and analyzed for themes relating to aggressive play in minor ice hockey. Results Parents, coaches, teammates and the media exert a large influence on player behavior. Aggressive behavior is often reinforced by the player’s social environment and justified by players to demonstrate loyalty to teammates and especially injured teammates by seeking revenge particularly in competitive, body-checking leagues. Among female and male players in non-body checking organizations, aggressive play is not reinforced by the social environment. These findings are discussed within the framework of social identity theory and social learning theory, in order to understand players’ need to seek revenge and how the social environment reinforces aggressive behaviors. Conclusion This study provides a better understanding of the players’ motivations and environmental influences around aggressive and violent play which may be conducive to injury. The findings can be used to help design interventions aimed at reducing aggression and related injuries sustained during ice hockey and sports with similar cultures and rules."
https://openalex.org/W2417592541,"The SLAM family receptors contribute to diverse aspects of lymphocyte biology and signal via the small adaptor molecule SAP. Mutations affecting SAP lead to X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome Type 1, a severe immunodysregulation characterized by fulminant mononucleosis, dysgammaglobulinemia, and lymphoproliferation/lymphomas. Patients and mice having mutations affecting SAP also lack germinal centers due to a defect in T:B cell interactions and are devoid of invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. However, which and how SLAM family members contribute to these phenotypes remains uncertain. Three SLAM family members: SLAMF1, SLAMF5 and SLAMF6, are highly expressed on T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells. SLAMF1 and SLAMF6 are also implicated in iNKT development. Although individual receptor knockout mice have limited iNKT and germinal center phenotypes compared to SAP knockout mice, the generation of multi-receptor knockout mice has been challenging, due to the genomic linkage of the genes encoding SLAM family members. Here, we used Cas9/CRISPR-based mutagenesis to generate mutations simultaneously in Slamf1, Slamf5 and Slamf6. Genetic disruption of all three receptors in triple-knockout mice (TKO) did not grossly affect conventional T or B cell development and led to mild defects in germinal center formation post-immunization. However, the TKO worsened defects in iNKT cells development seen in SLAMF6 single gene-targeted mice, supporting data on positive signaling and potential redundancy between these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2418022882,"This study investigated the effects of ensiled mulberry leaves (EML) and sun-dried mulberry fruit pomace (SMFP) on the ruminal bacterial and archaeal community composition of finishing steers. Corn grain- and cotton meal-based concentrate was partially replaced with EML or SMFP. The diets had similar crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and metabolizable energy. Following the feeding trial, the steers were slaughtered and ruminal liquid samples were collected to study the ruminal microbiome. Extraction of DNA, amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and Illumina MiSeq pyrosequencing were performed for each sample. Following sequence de-noising, chimera checking, and quality trimming, an average of 209,610 sequences were generated per sample. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to examine the selected bacterial species in the rumen. Our results showed that the predominant phyla were Bacteroidetes (43.90%), Firmicutes (39.06%), Proteobacteria (4.31%), and Tenericutes (2.04%), and the predominant genera included Prevotella (13.82%), Ruminococcus (2.51%), Butyrivibrio (2.38%), and Succiniclasticum (2.26%). Compared to the control group, EML and SMFP groups had a higher abundance of total bacteria (p < 0.001); however, the bacterial community composition was similar among the three groups. At the phylum level, there were no significant differences in Firmicutes (p = 0.7932), Bacteroidetes (p = 0.2330), Tenericutes (p = 0.2811), or Proteobacteria (p = 0.0680) levels among the three groups; however, Fibrobacteres decreased in EML (p = 0.0431). At the genus level, there were no differences in Prevotella (p = 0.4280), Ruminococcus (p = 0.2639), Butyrivibrio (p = 0.4433), or Succiniclasticum (p = 0.0431) levels among the groups. Additionally, the dietary treatments had no significant effects on the archaeal community composition in the rumen. Therefore, EML and SMFP supplementation had no significant effects on the ruminal bacterial or archaeal community composition of finishing steers."
https://openalex.org/W2415131859,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants, the elderly and in immunosuppressed populations. The vast majority of neutralizing antibodies isolated from human subjects target the RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein, making it an attractive target for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Currently, Synagis® (palivizumab) is the only FDA approved antibody drug for the prevention of RSV infection, and there is a great need for more effective vaccines and therapeutics. Phage display is a powerful tool in antibody discovery with the advantage that it does not require samples from immunized subjects. In this study, Morphosys HuCAL GOLD® phage libraries were used for panning against RSV prefusion and postfusion F proteins. Panels of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against RSV F protein were discovered following phage library panning and characterized. Antibodies binding specifically to prefusion or postfusion F proteins and those binding both conformations were identified. 3B1 is a prototypic postfusion F specific antibody while 2E1 is a prototypic prefusion F specific antibody. 2E1 is a potent broadly neutralizing antibody against both RSV A and B strains. Epitope mapping experiments identified a conformational epitope spanning across three discontinuous sections of the RSV F protein, as well as critical residues for antibody interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2419634504,"An increasing number of studies have investigated microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential markers of diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. So far, agreement between studies has been minimal, which may in part be explained by intratumoral heterogeneity of miRNA expression. The aim of the present study was to assess the heterogeneity of a panel of selected miRNAs in rectal cancer, using two different technical approaches.The expression of the investigated miRNAs was analysed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH) in tumour specimens from 27 patients with T3-4 rectal cancer. From each tumour, tissue from three different luminal localisations was examined. Inter- and intra-patient variability was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Correlations between RT-qPCR and ISH were evaluated using Spearman's correlation.ICCsingle (one sample from each patient) was higher than 50% for miRNA-21 and miRNA-31. For miRNA-125b, miRNA-145, and miRNA-630, ICCsingle was lower than 50%. The ICCmean (mean of three samples from each patient) was higher than 50% for miRNA-21(RT-qPCR and ISH), miRNA-125b (RT-qPCR and ISH), miRNA-145 (ISH), miRNA-630 (RT-qPCR), and miRNA-31 (RT-qPCR). For miRNA-145 (RT-qPCR) and miRNA-630 (ISH), ICCmean was lower than 50%. Spearman correlation coefficients, comparing results obtained by RT-qPCR and ISH, respectively, ranged from 0.084 to 0.325 for the mean value from each patient, and from -0.085 to 0.515 in the section including the deepest part of the tumour.Intratumoral heterogeneity may influence the measurement of miRNA expression and consequently the number of samples needed for representative estimates. Our findings with two different methods suggest that one sample is sufficient for adequate assessment of miRNA-21 and miRNA-31, whereas more samples would improve the assessment of miRNA-125b, miRNA-145, and miRNA-630. Interestingly, we found a poor correlation between the expression estimates obtained by RT-qPCR and ISH, respectively."

Informed consent is a key component of bio-medical research involving human participants. However, obtaining informed consent is challenging in low literacy and resource limited settings. Rapid Ethical Assessment (REA) can be used to contextualize and simplify consent information within a given study community. The current study aimed to explore the effects of social, cultural, and religious factors during informed consent process on a proposed HPV-serotype prevalence study.

Methodology

A qualitative community-based REA was conducted in Adigudom and Mynebri Kebeles, Northern Ethiopia, from July to August 2013. Data were collected by a multi-disciplinary team using open ended questions concerning informed consent components in relation to the parent study. The team conducted one-to-one In-Depth Interviews (IDI) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with key informants and community members to collect data based on the themes of the study. Tape recorded data were transcribed in Tigrigna and then translated into English. Data were categorized and thematically analyzed using open coding and content analysis based on pre-defined themes.

Results

The REA study revealed a number of socio-cultural issues relevant to the proposed study. Low community awareness about health research, participant rights and cervical cancer were documented. Giving a vaginal sample for testing was considered to be highly embarrassing, whereas giving a blood sample made participants worry that they might be given a result without the possibility of treatment. Verbal consent was preferred to written consent for the proposed study.

Conclusion

This rapid ethical assessment disclosed important socio-cultural issues which might act as barriers to informed decision making. The findings were important for contextual modification of the Information Sheet, and to guide the best consent process for the proposed study. Both are likely to have enabled participants to understand the informed consent better and consequently to comply with the study."

The intrinsic structure of the HIV transmission among different individuals has valuable importance for the understanding of the epidemic and for the public health response. The aim of this study was to characterize the HIV-1 subtype B (HIV-1B) epidemic in South America through the identification of transmission links and infer trends about geographical patterns and median time of transmission between individuals. Sequences of the protease and reverse transcriptase coding regions from 4,810 individuals were selected from GenBank. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred and submitted to ClusterPicker to identify transmission links. Bayesian analyses were applied only for clusters including ≥5 dated samples in order to estimate the median maximum inter-transmission interval. This study analyzed sequences sampled from 12 South American countries, from individuals of different exposure categories, under different antiretroviral profiles, and from a wide period of time (1989–2013). Continentally, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela were revealed important sites for the spread of HIV-1B among countries inside South America. Of note, from all the clusters identified about 70% of the HIV-1B infections are primarily occurring among individuals living in the same geographic region. In addition, these transmissions seem to occur early after the infection of an individual, taking in average 2.39 years (95% CI 1.48–3.30) to succeed. Homosexual/Bisexual individuals transmit the virus as quickly as almost half time of that estimated for the general population sampled here. Public health services can be broadly benefitted from this kind of information whether to focus on specific programs of response to the epidemic whether as guiding of prevention campaigns to specific risk groups."
https://openalex.org/W2416721434,"Caldicellulosiruptor bescii encodes at least six unique multimodular glycoside hydrolases crucial for plant cell wall polysaccharides degradation, with each having two catalytic domains separated by two to three carbohydrate binding modules. Among the six enzymes, three have one N- or C-terminal GH5 domain with identical amino acid sequences. Despite a few reports on some of these multimodular enzymes, little is known about how the conserved GH5 domains behave, which are believed to be important due to the gene duplication. We thus cloned a representative GH5 domain from the C-terminus of a multimodular protein, i.e. the bifunctional cellulase/mannanase CbCel9B/Man5A which has been reported, and expressed it in Escherichia coli. Without any appending CBMs, the recombinant CbMan5A was still able to hydrolyze a variety of mannan substrates with different backbone linkages or side-chain decorations. While CbMan5A displayed the same pH optimum as CbCel9B/Man5A, it had an increased optimal temperature (90°C) and moreover, was activated by heating at 70°C and 80°C, a property not ever reported for the full-length protein. The turnover numbers of CbMan5A on mannan substrates were, however, lower than those of CbCel9B/Man5A. These data suggested that evolution of CbMan5A and the other domains into a single polypeptide is not a simple assembly; rather, the behavior of one module may be affected by the other ones in the full-length enzyme. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis further indicated that heating CbMan5A was not a simple transition state process. To the best knowledge of the authors, CbMan5A is the first glycoside hydrolase with thermal activation property identified from a multimodular bifunctional enzyme."

We previously demonstrated that Tpl2 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and modulates T helper cell differentiation. However, very little is known about how Tpl2 modulates the development of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs are a specialized subset of T cells that express FoxP3 and possess immunosuppressive properties to limit excess inflammation. Because of the documented role of Tpl2 in promoting inflammation, we hypothesized that Tpl2 antagonizes Treg development and immunosuppressive function. Here we demonstrate that Tpl2 constrains the development of inducible Tregs. Tpl2−/− naïve CD4+ T cells preferentially develop into FoxP3+ inducible Tregs in vitro as well as in vivo in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced systemic tolerance. Treg biasing of Tpl2−/− T cells depended on TCR signal strength and corresponded with reduced activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Importantly, Tpl2−/− Tregs have basally increased expression of FoxP3 and immunosuppressive molecules, IL-10 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4). Furthermore, they were more immunosuppressive in vivo in a T cell transfer model of colitis, as evidenced by reduced effector T cell accumulation, systemic production of inflammatory cytokines, and colonic inflammation. These results demonstrate that Tpl2 promotes inflammation in part by constraining FoxP3 expression and Treg immunosuppressive functions. Overall, these findings suggest that Tpl2 inhibition could be used to preferentially drive Treg induction and thereby limit inflammation in a variety of autoimmune diseases.

To our knowledge, no study has focused on its molecular biology owing to the lack of available transgenic methods and sequence information for S. rostratum. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a powerful tool for the study of gene function in plants; therefore, in the present study, we aimed to establish tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-derived VIGS in S. rostratum. The genes for phytoene desaturase (PDS) and Chlorophyll H subunit (ChlH) of magnesium protoporphyrin chelatase were cloned from S. rostratum and used as reporters of gene silencing. It was shown that high-efficiency VIGS can be achieved in the leaves, flowers, and fruit of S. rostratum. Moreover, based on our comparison of three different types of infection methods, true leaf infection was found to be more efficient than cotyledon and sprout infiltration in long-term VIGS in multiple plant organs. In conclusion, the VIGS technology and tomato genomic sequences can be used in the future to study gene function in S. rostratum."

This study was conducted to explore the potential factors correlated with RRF. A cross-sectional study was conducted by recruiting 155 patients with residual GFR more than 1mL/min per 1.73m2 at the initiation of peritoneal dialysis. We collected the demographic characteristics, nutritional markers and biochemical parameters of all participants, and analyzed the correlation between these variables and residual GFR as well. The odds ratio of RRF loss associated with each of the nutritional markers and biochemical parameters were estimated by logistic regression model. The residual GFR was negatively correlated with serum phosphate (ORQ3 = 2.67, 95%CI: 1.03–6.92; ORQ4 = 3.45, 95%CI: 1.35–9.04), magnesium (ORQ4 = 3.77, 95%CI: 1.48–3.63), and creatinine (ORQ3 = 2.93, 95%CI: 1.09–7.88; ORQ4 = 8.64 95%CI: 2.79–26.78), while positively associated with normalized protein catabolic rate (ORQ3 = 0.24, 95%CI: 0.09–0.65; ORQ4 = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.03–0.35), 24 hours urine volume(ORQ1 = 22.87, 95%CI: 2.76–189.24; ORQ3 = 0.08, 95%CI: 0.02–0.28) and serum chlorine concentrations (ORQ1 = 5.34, 95%CI: 1.94–14.68; ORQ4 = 0.28, 95%CI: 0.09–0.85), respectively.

The results showed that the compound eyes of adult P. dubia are of the apposition type, each eye comprising more than 1200 ommatidia. The ommatidium consists of a cornea, a crystalline cone made up of four cone cells, eight photoreceptors, two primary pigment cells, and 18 secondary pigment cells. The adult ommatidium has a fused rhabdom with eight photoreceptors. Seven photoreceptors extend from the proximal end of the crystalline cone to the basal matrix, whereas the eighth photoreceptor is shorter, extending from the middle level of the photoreceptor cluster to the basal matrix. The fused rhabdom is composed of the rhabdomeres of different photoreceptors at different levels.

Here, we employed transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-assisted homologous recombination in goat fibroblasts to introduce human α-lactalbumin (hLA) genes into goat BLG locus. TALEN-mediated targeting enabled isolation of colonies with mono- and bi-allelic transgene integration in up to 10.1% and 1.1%, respectively, after selection. Specifically, BLG mRNA levels were gradually decreasing in both mo- and bi-allelic goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) while hLA demonstrated expression in GMECs in vitro. Gene-targeted fibroblast cells were efficiently used in somatic cell nuclear transfer, resulting in production of hLA knock-in goats directing down-regulated BLG expression and abundant hLA secretion in animal milk. Our findings provide valuable background for animal milk optimization and expedited development for agriculture and biomedicine."

It has been shown that Ras1 undergoes phosphorylation, but the functional consequences and regulation of Ras1 phosphorylation remain unknown. Here we identify Ser-226 as an important residue for Ras1 phosphorylation, as mutating this residue to an alanine drastically diminishes the level of Ras1 phosphorylation. Notably, phosphorylated Ras1 accumulates as the cells approach the stationary phase of growth. Likewise, subjecting cells to nitrogen starvation also elevates the level of Ras1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, blocking Ras1 phosphorylation diminishes the level of autophagy and also renders the cells more sensitive to heat shock. Together, these data suggest a role of Ras1 phosphorylation in modulating nutrient signaling and stress response."

Poultry-exposed individuals are considered to be at high risk of infection with avian influenza viruses due to frequent exposure to poultry. Some avian H7 viruses have occasionally been found to infect humans. Seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies against influenza A/H7N7 virus among poultry-exposed and unexposed individuals in Egypt were assessed during a three-years prospective cohort study. The seroprevalence of antibodies (titer, ≥80) among exposed individuals was 0%, 1.9%, and 2.1% annually while the seroprevalence among the control group remained 0% as measured by virus microneutralization assay. We then confirmed our results using western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Although human infection with H7 in Egypt has not been reported yet, our results suggested that Egyptian poultry growers are exposed to avian H7 viruses. These findings highlight the need for surveillance in the people exposed to poultry to monitor the risk of zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses."

We retrospectively analyzed data from the contact participants to identify risk factors for eventual TB development and investigated the diagnostic efficacy of regular sputum check-ups.Among 133 contact participants, 16 (12.0%) developed TB during the 4-year follow-up period. Low body-mass-index (BMI) (<21) (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-8.98) and long duration of contact (>3 months) (aHR 8.70, 95% CI, 1.14-63.34) independently predicted the development of TB. Even though regular sputum check-ups required significant resources, they did facilitate the early identification of new TB cases among the contact participants. Regular sputum check-ups for high-risk patients based on BMI, contact duration and CXR findings may be a practical approach when compared with universal sputum follow-up, with a slightly decreased sensitivity but high positive likelihood ratio (88%, [95% CI, 62-98%] and 5.12, [95%CI, 3.30-7.95], respectively).While regular sputum check-ups for all contact participants facilitated the early identification of cases after the outbreak of TB in the healthcare facility, regular sputum check-ups for high-risk patients might be an effective alternative in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W2419556034,"Past research on pathogenesis of a complex disease suggests that differentially expressed message RNAs (mRNAs) can be noted as biomarkers of a disease. However, significant miRNA-mediated regulation change might also be more deep underlying cause of a disease. In this study, a miRNA-mediated regulation module is defined based on GO terms (Gene Ontology terms) from which dysfunctional modules are identified as the suspected cause of a disease. A miRNA-mediated regulation module contains mRNAs annotated to a GO term and MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which regulate the mRNAs. Based on the miRNA-mediated regulation coefficients estimated from the expression profiles of the mRNA and the miRNAs, a SW (single regulation-weight) value is then designed to evaluate the miRNA-mediated regulation change of an mRNA, and the modules with significantly differential SW values are thus identified as dysfunctional modules. The approach is applied to Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and it identifies 70 dysfunctional miRNA-mediated regulation modules from initial 4381 modules. The identified dysfunctional modules are detected to be comprehensive reflection of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. The proposed approach suggests that accumulated alteration in miRNA-mediated regulation might cause functional alterations, which further cause a disease. Moreover, this approach can also be used to identify diffentially miRNA-mediated regulated mRNAs showing more comprehensive underlying association with a disease than differentially expressed mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2413258966,"Echo planar imaging (EPI) suffers from geometric distortions caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities, which can be time-varying as a result of small amounts of head motion that occur over seconds and minutes during fMRI experiments, also known as ""dynamic geometric distortion"". Phase Labeling for Additional Coordinate Encoding (PLACE) is a promising technique for geometric distortion correction without reduced temporal resolution and in principle can be used to correct for motion-induced dynamic geometric distortion. PLACE requires at least two EPI images of the same anatomy that are ideally acquired with no variation in the magnetic field inhomogeneities. However, head motion and lung ventilation during the respiratory cycle can cause changes in magnetic field inhomogeneities within the EPI pair used for PLACE. In this work, we exploited dynamic off-resonance in k-space (DORK) and averaging to correct the within EPI pair magnetic field inhomogeneities; and hence proposed a combined technique (DORK+PLACE+averaging) to mitigate dynamic geometric distortion in EPI-based fMRI while preserving the temporal resolution. The performance of the combined DORK, PLACE and averaging technique was characterized through several imaging experiments involving test phantoms and six healthy adult volunteers. Phantom data illustrate reduced temporal standard deviation of fMRI signal intensities after use of combined dynamic PLACE, DORK and averaging compared to the standard processing and static geometric distortion correction. The combined technique also substantially improved the temporal standard deviation and activation maps obtained from human fMRI data in comparison to the results obtained by standard processing and static geometric distortion correction, highlighting the utility of the approach."
https://openalex.org/W2415369568,"Image labeling is essential for analyzing morphometric features in medical imaging data. Labels can be obtained by either human interaction or automated segmentation algorithms, both of which suffer from errors. The Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) algorithm for both discrete-valued and continuous-valued labels has been proposed to find the consensus fusion while simultaneously estimating rater performance. In this paper, we first show that the previously reported continuous STAPLE in which bias and variance are used to represent rater performance yields a maximum likelihood solution in which bias is indeterminate. We then analyze the major cause of the deficiency and evaluate two classes of auxiliary bias estimation processes, one that estimates the bias as part of the algorithm initialization and the other that uses a maximum a posteriori criterion with a priori probabilities on the rater bias. We compare the efficacy of six methods, three variants from each class, in simulations and through empirical human rater experiments. We comment on their properties, identify deficient methods, and propose effective methods as solution."
https://openalex.org/W2442031412,"We investigated the extent to which recognition of Chinese characters influenced same-different matching performance that did not require recognition. In each experimental trial, two partially occluded characters were shown sequentially, and participants decided whether or not they were the same. The two characters were either both upright or both inverted and mirror-reflected. The participants' Chinese reading fluency spanned the full range, from not knowing any characters to native speakers. The participants who could recognize some characters (defined as readers) were subsequently tested with character recognition in a naming task. Interestingly, although the readers' recognition accuracies well correlated with their years of Chinese language schooling, they were uncorrelated with the matching accuracies in the same-different task with upright characters. The only indication of top-down influence was the readers' higher accuracy in matching upright than inverted and reflected characters. However, the magnitude of this effect was small, to the extent that the average same-different accuracies were comparable for readers and non-readers alike. This small effect was further confirmed with native speakers in China, who should give rise to the largest possible effect. We conclude that top-down influence from character recognition was present but very limited, at least with the task and stimuli used."
