https://openalex.org/W1627867690,ATP-dependent calcium uptake of rat liver microsomes is examined following ingestion of CC14 (2.5 ml/kg). Within 30 min there is an abrupt drop in calcium uptake activity of the liver microsomes. This activity remains down for 48 hours before slowly returning to normal levels. The effect is specific for CC14 as contrasted with CHC13 and CH2Cl2. The CCl4 does not affect similar calcium uptake activity of kidney microsomes. Calcium uptake activity of the liver mitochondria is unaffected. The first 12 hours after CCl4 ingestion there is a relatively slow rise in the calcium content of the liver tissue and mitochondria. After 12 hours a much larger influx of calcium into the tissue and the mitochondria takes place. Forty-eight hours after CCl4 ingestion the process begins to slowly reverse. The following postulated sequence may relate to the CCl4 hepatotocicity. CCl4 is activated to free radicals by the liver endoplasmic reticulum. The free radical inactivate calcium pump activity of the liver endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium levels of the cytoplasm increase and significantly modify ion permeability of the plasma membrane. High levels of external calcium enter the cytoplasm and are sequestered in the mitochondria. The high level of mitochondrial calcium uptake inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The specific sensitivity of the calcium pump activity of liver microsomes to CCl4 further establishes the identity of a system seperate from the mitochondrial system. The above postulated sequence of events would suggest a critical role in liver metabolism for calcium pump activity of the endoplasmic reticulum.

https://openalex.org/W1573547824,"A rapid filtration method was used to measure initial rates of 3-O-[3H]methylglucose uptake and thus estimate hexose transport system activity in isolated white fat cells. Insulin markedly stimulated the transport system activity and its effect was rapidly and completely reversible. In addition, such oxidants as vitamin K5 (50 muM), hydrogen peroxide (4mM), methylene blue (50 muM), and diamide (20 mM) also maximally activated 3-O-methylglucose transport and their effects were not additive to those of maximal concentrations of insulin. These oxidants had no effect on total cellular ATP levels under these conditions. Hexose transport system activity in either the presence or absence of these stimulatory agents was uniformly sensitive to inhibition by cytochalasin B. Treatment of fat cells with either 0.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 3 mM dithio(bis)nitrobenzoic acid abolished the ability of insulin or oxidants to activate hexose transport system activity. Control transport activity was not significantly influenced by these agents. Fat cells treated with dithio(bis)nitrobenzoic acid completely regained the ability to respond to insulin or vitamin K5 after removal of the agent by washing in low concentrations of reductant. Elevated rates of transport due to prior incubation of cells with insulin or vitamin K5 were completely resistant to inhibition by subsequent addition of N-ethylmaleimide or dithio(bis)nitrobenzoic acid. Deactivation of the hormone-stimulated transport system could be achieved by washing cells free of insulin or by destruction of insulin-receptor interaction by trypsin. N-Ethylmaleimide effectively blocked deactivation of insulin-stimulated transport system activity, while dithio(bis)nitrobenzoic acid was without effect. These results suggest that distinct cellular components mediate activation versus deactivation of the fat cell hexose transport system. N-Ethylmaleimide, which effectively penetrates fat cells, inhibits both processes while the layer, more polar dithio(bis)nitrobenzoic acid blocks activation but not deactivation of this transport system."

A detailed study of cytochrome C oxidse activity with Keilin-Hartree particles and purified beef heart enzyme, at low ionic strength and low cytochrome C concentrations, showed biphasic kinetics with apparent Km1 = 5 x 10(-8) M, and apparent Km2 = 0.35 to 1.0 x 10(-6) M. Direct binding studies with purified oxidase, phospholipid-containing as well as phospholipid-depleted, demonstrated two sites of interaction of cytochrome c with the enzyme, with KD2 less than or equal to 10(-7) M, and KD2 = 10(-6) M. 2..."

https://openalex.org/W2088703956,"The beta subunit of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH-beta) from human pituitary glands was reduced and S-aminoethylated prior to thermolytic, tryptic, and chymotryptic digestions. Each digest was gel-filtered on Sephadex G-50 to seperate the glycopeptides. The glycopeptides and the peptides were isolated by high voltage paper electrophoresis at pH 6, 3.5, and 2.0. The purity of the isolated peptides was confirmed by amino acid analyses. The amino acid sequences of peptides were determined by Edman degradation followed by subtractive amino acid analysis and, in certain cases, confirmed by dansylation. COOH-terminal sequences of the peptides were determined by digestion with carboxypeptidases A and B and by hydrazinolysis. The tryptophan content of human follicle-stimulating hormone, of the beta subunit of human follicle-stimulating hormone, and of the glycopeptides obtained from the enzymic digests was determined by fluorescence spectra, titration against N-bromosuccinimide, colorimetric estimation with p-dimethyl aminobenzaldehyde, hydrolysis with methane sulfonic acid containing 0.2% tryptamine followed by amino acid analysis, microbiological assay, and sequence analysis. The presence of 1 tryptophan residue in the beta subunit was indicated."

https://openalex.org/W2038979224,"IT is generally accepted that the Sun affects the Earth's magneto-sphere and ionosphere by variations in the ultraviolet and X-ray radiation and in the solar wind due both to short lived disturbances such as flares1 and to long lived effects such as that associated with the ‘sector structure’ of the interplanetary magnetic field2. There have, however, been repeated claims3,4 for well over a century that the Sun influences many other processes on Earth, including terrestrial weather and human disorders. Friedman, Becker and Bachman5–7 have presented evidence for an association between geomagnetic storms, cosmic-ray flux variations and psychological behaviour. The term geomagnetic storm is used for worldwide fluctuations in the Earth's field with a scale of about 100γ over a period of several hours, caused by the impact of a solar plasma front on the magnetosphere. A number of Russian scientists8–10 have claimed that there is a real association between geomagnetic storms and the incidence of various human diseases. Within this general area, one of the most active areas of current research seems to be the correlation of solar activity and myocardial infarction and stroke. We have searched for a similar correlation in the USA but have failed to find one."

https://openalex.org/W1496782455,"Pulsed Fourier transform proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to study the glutamate-alanine transaminase-catalyzed incorporation of deuterium from solvent deuterium oxide into the alpha and beta positions of L-alanine. It was found that the beta proton resonance signal initially disappears slightly faster than the signal due to the alpha proton, but whereas the alpha proton signal decays exponentially, that due to the beta proton signal does not. Eventually, the rate of decrease of the alpha proton signal becomes greater than that for the beta proton. This change in the relative rates is ascribed to a deuterium isotope effect upon substitution of an alpha proton by a deuteron. Furthermore, as deuterium begins to replace hydrogen, two classes of alanine become distinguishable, i.e. alanine which contains deuterium in the alpha position and hydrogen in the beta position, and alanine which contains hydrogen in the alpha position and deuterium in the beta position. Thus, removal of all 3 beta protons is not contingent upon loss of an alpha proton from the same molecule. The two classes of deuterated alanine may conceivably arise by a scrambling mechanism in which protons are transferred from the alpha to the beta position and vice versa. Present evidence excludes this scramblong mechanism and leads to the conclusion that deuterium incorporation into L-alanine involves, (a) the reversible enzymatic conversion of the classical ketimine enzymes intermediate to an enaminetype structure, and (b) considerable conservation of label during the prototropic shift from the alpha carbon of L-alanine to the C4-position of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. It is also postulated that alanine binds at the active site in such a way as to bring the beta protons into close contact with a basic group on the enzyme surface. This group is distinct from that used in abstraction of an alpha proton. The beta protons of glutamate are not enzymatically removed; presumably glutamate binds in such a way that the beta protons cannot effectively interact with an enzyme base. Similar studies were carried out on soluble glutamate-aspartate transaminase; no evidence was found for significant enzyme-catalyzed deuterium incorporation into the beta position of L-glutamate, L-aspartate, and L-alanine."

https://openalex.org/W1578026804,"Under controlled conditions of diet, age, and animal management we confirmed our earlier studies that the fractional turnover rate constant of rat liver ornithine aminotransferase (L-ornithine:2-oxoacid aminotransferase, EC 2.6.1.13) was about 0.4 day-1 when estimated by tracer technique. However, when estimated by the kinetics of enzyme activity perturbation during dietary induction or return to normal levels, a value of about 0.7 day-1 was obtained. This discrepancy may now be attributed in part to a transistory change in the fractional rate constant during enzyme adaption."

https://openalex.org/W163733887,"Chicks convert both orally and intravenously administered 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 rapidly to 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3. The maximal accumulation of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 in intestine precedes the intestinal absorption response to 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 by at least 2 hours. Oral administration results in the highest concentrations of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 in intestine, giving a level about 1.5 times that achieved with an intravenous dose. On the other hand, an oral dose of 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitaminD3 gives much lower amounts of both 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 and 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 in bone and blood than an intravenous dose, which suggests that the 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 may not be utilized as well by the oral route as by an intravenous route. Liver homogenates from both rat and chick convert 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 to 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3. However, intestinal homogenates from chick, but not rat, can also cary out this conversion, which may account for the higher concentration of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3 found in the intestine of chicks given an oral dose of 1alpha-hydroxy[6-3H]vitamin D3."

https://openalex.org/W1987778509,"ALTHOUGH there is general agreement on the sequence of events at birth for several marsupial species1, it is still not known how the newborn joey navigates on its journey from the mother's cloaca to her pouch. Frith and Calaby2 have postulated that, at birth, the red kangaroo (Megaleia rufa) “… has large nostrils and presumably a well developed sense of smell which probably plays a major part in its location of the pouch”. On the other hand, Hartman3 has suggested that the newborn opossum (Didelphis virginiand) was “negatively geotropic” though he has now modified this view considerably4, as histological studies have revealed that the vestibular apparatus of the newborn animal is undirTerentiated and therefore nonfunctional5,6. To investigate whether one of these mechanisms2,4 could account for the behaviour of the newborn quokka (Setonix brachyurus) we have observed parturition in this macropodid marsupial."

https://openalex.org/W2006837640,"WE have reported1 the reduction of dinitrogen, in cis-[M(N2)2-(PMe2Ph)4] (A, where M = Mo or W), to ammonia, on treatment with sulphuric acid in methanol at 20 °C. The reaction of the molybdenum complex is complete in 3–4 min but the yield (≤ 0.8 mol per Mo atom) is only about half that from the tungsten complex (≤ 1.8 mol per W atom), which requires about 0.5 h for complete reaction. We now find that ammonia is produced almost equally well, (1.7 mol per W atom), but much more slowly, from a methanol solution of A, (with M = W) either at the boil (3–4 h) or on irradiation for 30 h at 20 °C (2 × 150-W tungsten filament lamps); a boiling ethanol solution yields only 0.4 mol NH3 per W atom. In contrast, A, (with M = Mo) gives very little ammonia (only 0.08 mol per Mo at best) in any of the above conditions; instead it evolves dinitrogen and dihydrogen."

https://openalex.org/W1976306002,"MACROPHAGES can have critical roles in repair, inflammation and a large variety of immunological phenomena1,2. The biological roles of these cells often occur subsequent to their ‘activation’, a subjective term which refers to a greatly heightened state of reactivity1–3. Activation can be induced by a variety of stimuli including ingestion of certain macro-organisms, contact with immune complexes, bacterial lipopolysaccharides and lymphokines3. Activated macrophages usually show an increase in cell size, increased adherence properties and cellular processes, lysosomal enzyme activity, and phagocytic ability1,2. In addition, alteration in characteristics and functions of various macrophage receptors can apparently take place as a consequence of activation4,5. Such a change is described in this paper: it involves Fc receptors as detected by Fc or EA rosette formation (see Table 1), and their relationship to surface mouse major histocompatibility (H–2) antigens as detected by anti-H–2 alloantisera. Aside from the general relevance this change has with regard to membrane alterations which occur in activated lymphoreticular cells, it can also be exploited as a marker for activated macrophages."
