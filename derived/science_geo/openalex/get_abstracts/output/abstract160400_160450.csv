https://openalex.org/W2147569451,"The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most potent source of interannual climate variability. Uncertainty surrounding the impact of greenhouse warming on ENSO strength and frequency has stimulated efforts to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of ENSO to climate change. Here we use annually banded corals from Papua New Guinea to show that ENSO has existed for the past 130,000 years, operating even during “glacial” times of substantially reduced regional and global temperature and changed solar forcing. However, we also find that during the 20th century ENSO has been strong compared with ENSO of previous cool (glacial) and warm (interglacial) times. The observed pattern of change in amplitude may be due to the combined effects of ENSO dampening during cool glacial conditions and ENSO forcing by precessional orbital variations."

Although recent advancements in solid-phase synthesis have made the construction of complex oligosaccharides less tedious, a high level of technical expertise is still necessary to obtain the desired structures. We describe the automated chemical synthesis of several oligosaccharides on a solid-phase synthesizer. A branched dodecasaccharide was synthesized through the use of glycosyl phosphate building blocks and an octenediol functionalized resin. The target oligosaccharide was readily obtained after cleavage from the solid support. Access to certain complex oligosaccharides now has become feasible in a fashion much like the construction of oligopeptides and oligonucleotides."

We organized an international functional annotation meeting (FANTOM) to annotate the first 21,076 cDNAs to be analysed in this project. Here we describe the first RIKEN clone collection, which is one of the largest described for any organism. Analysis of these cDNAs extends known gene families and identifies new ones."

https://openalex.org/W1565166977,"Senescence and genomic integrity are thought to be important barriers in the development of malignant lesions1. Human fibroblasts undergo a limited number of cell divisions before entering an irreversible arrest, called senescence2. Here we show that human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) do not conform to this paradigm of senescence. In contrast to fibroblasts, HMECs exhibit an initial growth phase that is followed by a transient growth plateau (termed selection or M0; refs 3,4,5), from which proliferative cells emerge to undergo further population doublings (∼20–70), before entering a second growth plateau (previously termed senescence or M1; refs 4,5,6). We find that the first growth plateau exhibits characteristics of senescence but is not an insurmountable barrier to further growth. HMECs emerge from senescence, exhibit eroding telomeric sequences and ultimately enter telomere-based crisis to generate the types of chromosomal abnormalities seen in the earliest lesions of breast cancer. Growth past senescent barriers may be a pivotal event in the earliest steps of carcinogenesis, providing many genetic changes that predicate oncogenic evolution. The differences between epithelial cells and fibroblasts provide new insights into the mechanistic basis of neoplastic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W1630919437,"Tropical South America is one of the three main centres of the global, zonal overturning circulation of the equatorial atmosphere (generally termed the 'Walker' circulation). Although this area plays a key role in global climate cycles, little is known about South American climate history. Here we describe sediment cores and down-hole logging results of deep drilling in the Salar de Uyuni, on the Bolivian Altiplano, located in the tropical Andes. We demonstrate that during the past 50,000 years the Altiplano underwent important changes in effective moisture at both orbital (20,000-year) and millennial timescales. Long-duration wet periods, such as the Last Glacial Maximum--marked in the drill core by continuous deposition of lacustrine sediments--appear to have occurred in phase with summer insolation maxima produced by the Earth's precessional cycle. Short-duration, millennial events correlate well with North Atlantic cold events, including Heinrich events 1 and 2, as well as the Younger Dryas episode. At both millennial and orbital timescales, cold sea surface temperatures in the high-latitude North Atlantic were coeval with wet conditions in tropical South America, suggesting a common forcing."

https://openalex.org/W1645714275,"Recent experimental results indicate that phosphorus, a single-component system, can have two liquid phases: a high-density liquid (HDL) and a low-density liquid (LDL) phase. A first-order transition between two liquids of different densities is consistent with experimental data for a variety of materials, including single-component systems such as water, silica and carbon. Molecular dynamics simulations of very specific models for supercooled water, liquid carbon and supercooled silica, predict a LDL-HDL critical point, but a coherent and general interpretation of the LDL-HDL transition is lacking. Here we show that the presence of a LDL and a HDL can be directly related to an interaction potential with an attractive part and two characteristic short-range repulsive distances. This kind of interaction is common to other single-component materials in the liquid state (in particular liquid metals), and such potentials are often used to decribe systems that exhibit a density anomaly. However, our results show that the LDL and HDL phases can occur in systems with no density anomaly. Our results therefore present an experimental challenge to uncover a liquid-liquid transition in systems like liquid metals, regardless of the presence of the density anomaly."

https://openalex.org/W2003409173,"We measured rate constants of thermal, interfacial electron transfer through oligophenylenevinylene bridges between a gold electrode and a tethered redox species in contact with an aqueous electrolyte using the indirect laser-induced temperature jump technique. Analysis of the distance dependence indicates that, unlike other bridges studied to date, the rate constants are not limited by electronic coupling for bridges up to 28 angstroms long. The energy levels of the bridges relative to those of the redox species rule out hopping through the bridge. We conclude that, out to 28 angstroms, the transfer is limited by structural reorganization and that electron tunneling occurs in less than 20 picoseconds, suggesting that oligophenylenevinylene bridges could be useful for wiring molecular electronic elements."
https://openalex.org/W2016841292,"Sexual selection can favor production of extravagant ornaments and weapons in the contest for access to the opposite sex. Existing explanations for the diversity of sexually selected structures focus on reproductive benefits conferred by particular ornament or weapon morphologies. Here, I show that costs of weapon production also may drive patterns of weapon evolution. In beetles, production of horns reduces the size of neighboring morphological structures (antennae, eyes, or wings, depending on the location of the horns), and these tradeoffs reveal unexpected functional associations between ecology and horn morphology. This study illustrates a critical but overlooked role of costs in sexual selection and has implications for understanding the evolution of animal morphology."

https://openalex.org/W1972188578,"The oxidation state of basaltic martian meteorites is determined from the partitioning of europium (Eu) in their pyroxenes. The estimated redox conditions for these samples correlate with their initial neodymium and strontium isotopic compositions. This is interpreted to imply varying degrees of interaction between the basaltic parent melts, derived from a source in the martian mantle, and a crustal component. Thus, the mantle source of these martian basalts may have a redox state close to that of the iron-wüstite buffer, whereas the martian crust may be more oxidized (with a redox state higher than or equal to that of the quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer). A difference in redox state of more than 3 log units between mantle and crustal reservoirs on Mars could result from oxidation of the crust by a process such as aqueous alteration, together with a subsequent lack of recycling of this oxidized crust through the reduced upper mantle."

https://openalex.org/W1973148087,"Yeast phosphofructokinase is a heterooctameric enzyme subject to a complex allosteric regulation. A mutation in thePFK1 gene, encoding the larger α-subunits, rendering the enzyme insensitive to allosteric inhibition by ATP was found to be caused by an exchange of proline 728 for a leucine residue. By in vitro mutagenesis, we introduced this mutation in eitherPFK1 or PFK2 and found that the exchange in either subunit drastically reduced the sensitivity of the holoenzyme to ATP inhibition. This was accompanied by a lack of allosteric activation by AMP, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, or ammonium and an increased resistance to heat inactivation. Yeast cells carrying either one mutation or both in conjunction did not display a strong phenotype when grown on fermentable carbon sources and did not show any significant changes in intermediary metabolites. Growth on non-fermentable carbon sources was clearly impaired. The strain carrying both mutant alleles was more sensitive to Congo Red than the wild-type strain or the single mutants indicating differences in cell wall composition. In addition, we found single pfk null mutants to be less viable than wild type at different storage temperatures and apfk2 null mutant to be temperature-sensitive for growth at 37 °C. The latter mutant was shown to be respiration-dependent for growth on glucose. Yeast phosphofructokinase is a heterooctameric enzyme subject to a complex allosteric regulation.

The latter mutant was shown to be respiration-dependent for growth on glucose. phosphofructokinase kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction Phosphofructokinase (Pfk1; E.C. 2.7.1.11) is a central enzyme of glycolysis found in almost all organisms from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. It catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate under ATP consumption,i.e. the second irreversible glycolytic reaction. Because of its allosteric properties, Pfk has been postulated to play a major role in the control of the glycolytic flux (reviewed in Ref. 1Kopperschläger G. Heinisch J.J. Zimmermann F.K. Entian K.D. Yeast Sugar Metabolism. Technomic Publishing Co. Inc., Lancaster, PA1997: 97-118Google Scholar). However, this role has been questioned by metabolic control calculations (2Galazzo J.L. Bailey J.E. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1990; 12: 162-172Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 3Westerhoff H.V. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 242-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In view of such models, the sensitivity of Pfk to allosteric regulation by a vast number of small molecules, especially in eukaryotes, remains a puzzling observation (reviewed in Ref. 4Sols A. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1981; 19: 77-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, ATP not only functions as a substrate, but also as an allosteric inhibitor at millimolar concentrations (5Banuelos M. Gancedo C. Gancedo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 6394-6398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, AMP (also in millimolar concentrations) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (effective in the micromolar range) are thought to be the most potent allosteric activators (6Avigad G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 7Nissler K. Otto A. Schellenberger W. Hofmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is also true for Pfk from bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is a heterooctameric enzyme composed of 4α- and 4β-subunits (8Kopperschläger G. Bär J. Nissler K. Hofmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 81: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), encoded byPFK1 and PFK2, respectively (note that this nomenclature is used by German and American groups (i.e.Ref. 9Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas Maitra and co-workers use the reverse designations, as in Ref. 10Lloyd D. James C.J. Maitra P.K. Yeast. 1992; 8: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants in either one of the genes still ferment glucose and are capable of growth on this carbon source, whereaspfk1 pfk2 double deletions are glucose-negative (11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of mutant alleles have been isolated for both PFKgenes, and their phenotypic consequences have been investigated in detail (Refs. 12Clifton D. Weinstock S.B. Fraenkel D.G. Genetics. 1978; 88: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ciriacy M. Breitenbach I. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 152-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Nadkarni M. Parmar L. Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 175: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, to name just a few studies). The genes have been cloned and sequenced (15Heinisch J. Ritzel R.G. Von Borstel R.C. Aguilera A. Rodicio R. Zimmermann F.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 78: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), providing the basis for targeted amino acid exchanges by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition to sequence comparisons between Pfks from a variety of organisms, this approach was aided by the determination of the x-ray structure of eubacterial Pfk (16Evans P.R. Hudson P.J. Nature. 1979; 279: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Shirakihara Y. Evans P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 973-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18Schirmer T. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 343: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Based on these works, we could show that critical amino acid residues in the active center are functionally conserved in the yeast and human muscle Pfk (11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Raben N. Exelbert R. Spiegel R. Sherman J.B. Nakajima H. Plotz P. Heinisch J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar). A hypothesis originally brought up by Poorman et al. (20Poorman R.A. Randolph A. Kemp R.G. Heinrikson R.L. Nature. 1984; 309: 467-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) attributes the origin of eukaryotic Pfk subunits to a gene duplication event, with the N-terminal half of each subunit retaining catalytic function and the C-terminal half evolving allosteric binding sites. This assumption was substantiated by our findings, when we abolished activation of yeast Pfk by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate using site-directed in vitro mutagenesis in sequences encoding the C-terminal halves of each subunit (21Heinisch J.J. Boles E. Timpel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As stated above, the importance of allosteric control of Pfk for yeast metabolism is an ongoing controversy. Since inhibition by ATP seems to be the principle regulatory mechanism (AMP and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate function by reversing this inhibition (see Refs. 6Avigad G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 102: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and7Nissler K. Otto A. Schellenberger W. Hofmann E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)), we started here to investigate this control at the level of enzyme structure and physiological consequences of altering ATP inhibition. For this purpose, we took advantage of a previous work, in which mutants insensitive to ATP inhibition were obtained in a genetic screen and shown to be caused by a defect in the α-subunits encoded byPFK1 (Ref. 22Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar; note again that these authors designate this gene encoding the larger Pfk subunits as PFK2). After identifying the altered base, we introduced the equivalent exchange byin vitro mutagenesis in the yeast PFK1 andPFK2 genes. Our data provide first clues to the localization of the regulatory ATP binding domain in eukaryotic Pfk subunits, for which x-ray structure analyses are not yet available. Yeast strain MCH-7B (derived from HD56–5A (Ref. 11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by deletion of the TRP1coding region) and its isogenic pfk deletion derivatives (Table I (available as supplemental material in on-line version)) were used as recipients for transformations with plasmids carrying in vitro mutated PFK alleles, for enzyme purification and determination of kinetic parameters. For amplification of plasmid DNA, E. coli strain DH5αF′ (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used throughout. Standard media and growth conditions were employed (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar). Rich media were based on 1% yeast extract and 2% bacto-peptone (Difco) and supplemented with 2% glucose (YEPD) or 1% glycerol and 3% ethanol (YEPGE) for growth of mutants unable to utilize glucose. Yeast transformants were selected on minimal medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose) supplemented with amino acids adenine and uracil (SC) as described (24Zimmermann F.K. Scheel I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), omitting uracil, tryptophan, leucine, or histidine when selecting for the respective markers. Standard molecular genetic procedures were followed in the preparation and handling of DNA (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983Google Scholar, 25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.S. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was carried out by a freeze method according to Ref. 26Klebe R.J. Harris J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene ( Amst. ). 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar. Deletions in the PFK genes were obtained by inverse PCR according to a method described by (27Eberhardt I. Hohmann S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we first constructed plasmids carrying either the PFK1 or thePFK2 gene in the pUK1921-derivative pUK19ea (obtained by digestion of pUK1921 (Ref. 28Heinisch J.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1103-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) with EcoRI/AccI, fill-in with Klenow, and religation to delete the BamHI site from the polylinker). PFK1 was subcloned as a 4-kbSphI fragment (= pJJH424; from −960 to + 3006 bp according to the published sequence reading the A from the translation start codon as +1) and PFK2 as a 4-kb PstI fragment (= pJJH422; from −899 to +3001 bp). For deletion of the open reading frames, the oligonucleotide pairs pProm1.1/pP1–60 and pProm2.2/pP2–60, each carrying a BamHI recognition sequence (Table II (available as supplemental material in on-line version)), were used for PCR on these templates. The products were then digested with BamHI and religated to yield pJJH428 (pfk1Δ) and pJJH429 (pfk2Δ). To the latter construct more 3′-non-coding sequences of PFK2 were added as an EcoRI/BamHI fragment (now enclosing sequences 830 bp downstream of the translational stop codon; pJJH463). pJJH428 and pJJH463 were linearized at the single BamHI sites to introduce a set of marker genes (HIS3, URA3,TRP1, and LEU2) from the YDp-vector series (29Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) as BamHI fragments into each. The resulting plasmids were used to construct a series of otherwise isogenic pfk single deletion mutants by taking advantage of homologous recombination using the one-step gene replacement method (30Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar). For localization of the PFK1 mutation in strain gTI-4C (22Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) the coding sequence was amplified from whole cells by PCR using the oligonucleotide pair pPFK1FusX/pPFK1endX (Table II (supplemental material)). From the product, the 2-kb BglII fragment (comprising about two thirds of the 5′ end of PFK1) and the 2.2-kb PstI/XhoI fragment (containing about two thirds of the 3′ end of PFK1, with the XhoI site introduced by one of the primers) were used to substitute either theBglII or the PstI/SalI fragment of YP1r (Fig. 1, based on the 2-μm vector YEp352 carryingPFK1 and its flanking regions as a 4-kb SphI fragment (Ref. 11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). As recipient plasmids for in vivo recombination, we constructed the yeast multicopy plasmids pJJH684 (pfk1Δ2196–2929, URA3) and pJJH685 (pfk2Δ2178–2830, LEU2) again by inverse PCR (27Eberhardt I. Hohmann S. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide pairs PFK1delXho-5′/PFK1delXho-3′ and PFK2delXho-5′/PFK2delXho-3′ (Table II (supplemental material)), respectively, to introduce a singleXhoI site. Plasmids pJJH680 (PFK1, bp +1988 to +3006) and pJJH681 (PFK2, bp +1991 to +2982) were then constructed as templates for in vitro mutagenesis by subcloning the 3′ end of each PFK gene as aBglII/BamHI fragment into pUK1921 linearized withBamHI, taking advantage of the internal BglII restriction site in each of the genes. Mutations were introduced by amplification with the oligonucleotide pairs universal-40/pfk1-P728L and universal-40/pfk2-P728L, respectively. PCR products were co-transformed with pJJH684 (pfk1Δ2196–2929,URA3) or pJJH685 (pfk2Δ2178–2830,LEU2), each linearized with XhoI, into the diploid yeast strain MCH-22D, selecting for uracil and leucine prototrophy, respectively. Recombinant plasmids were recovered, amplified in E. coli, and shown to produce the expected restriction fragments. All fragments introduced from PCR products were subjected to sequence analysis and confirmed to contain only the expected exchanges in comparison to the wild-type genes. ThePFK1 mutant allele (further designated asPFK1atp) was then subcloned as an SphI fragment into pT7T3 carrying the HIS3 marker in its BamHI site (a gift from Peter Kötter, University of Frankfurt, Germany) to yield pJJH769. The PFK2 mutant allele (further designated as PFK2atp) was subcloned as aBamHI fragment into YIplac128 with a LEU2 marker (31Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar) to yield pJJH770. For integration into the HIS3 andLEU2 loci pJJH769 was linearized with XhoI and pJJH770 with BstEII prior to transformation of AST3–2B (pfk1::TRP1) and AST8–6C (pfk2::URA3), respectively. Single integrants were chosen after Southern analysis and shown by PCR to contain the expectedpfk gene deletions of the recipient strains and the restriction sites indicative of the PFKatp mutations introduced (see oligonucleotides in Table II, available as supplemental material in on-line version). These were then recombined by a cross of the two strains, resulting in the diploid HD264. Segregants were obtained after tetrad analysis (Table I, available as supplemental material in on-line version) and used for further physiological characterizations. Pfk was purified for determination of kinetic parameters using a modification of the method of (32Kopperschläger G. Johannson G. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 124: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), based on precipitation with polyethylene glycol and affinity purification on Affi-Gel Blue columns, as described (11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was determined in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, containing 10 mm magnesium chloride, with 3 mm ATP and 0.5 mm fructose 6-phosphate in a standard assay mixture containing 0.2 mm NADH, 0.3 units of aldolase, 1.5 units of triosephosphate isomerase, and 0.5 units of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase without other effectors. The ancillary enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) in ammonium sulfate suspension. To test the effect of ammonium activation, the ancillary enzymes were purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany) as dried powder, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffer, and added to a final concentration of 1 unit/ml, each. For enzymatic determinations in crude extracts, 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 mmmagnesium chloride was used with the same ancillary enzymes as described above, but with substrate concentrations of 2.0 mm fructose 6-phosphate and 1 mm ATP, unless indicated otherwise. Allosteric activators like 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm ADP, and 10 μm fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were added as indicated. To determine glucose consumption and ethanol production rates, cells were grown overnight to late logarithmic phase in rich medium with 1% glycerol and 3% ethanol as carbon sources. They were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with distilled and sterile water, and resuspended in 50 ml of synthetic complete medium with 1% glucose at an A600 of about 0.5. Cultures were incubated with shaking at 30 °C, and 1-ml aliquots were removed each hour, cells separated by centrifugation for 3 min in a microcentrifuge, and supernatants frozen at −20 °C for later determinations. Growth was followed by determination of the A600 in an Ultraspec 4000 photometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determination of intermediate metabolite concentrations, a method described in Ref. 33Gonzalez B. Francois J. Renaud M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar was modified. Cells were grown overnight in 50 ml of synthetic complete medium containing 1% glycerol and 3% ethanol as carbon source. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 100 ml of synthetic complete medium with 4% glucose, and 50-ml aliquots were harvested by centrifugation after incubation at 30 °C for the times indicated. They were immediately resuspended in ice-cold 1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, and injected into 11.5 ml of boiling ethanol. After incubation for 3 min at 80 °C, suspensions were cooled on ice and dried to completeness under vacuum. After resuspension in 1.5 ml of distilled water, cell debris was separated by a 15-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was used for NADP- or NADH-coupled enzymatic determinations. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels were determined via activation of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase from potatoes as described previously (21Heinisch J.J. Boles E. Timpel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Calculations were based on the assumption that an A600 of 1 equals 0.4 mg/ml cell dry weight (34Heinisch J. Curr. Genet. 1986; 11: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum prepared against purified yeast Pfk was used for immunological detection of Pfk subunits in Western blots as described (11Arvanitidis A. Heinisch J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8911-8918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), visualized by treatment with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-rabbit-antibodies using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium staining. Sequences were obtained from SeqLab (Göttingen, Germany) with standard oligonucleotide primers or primers custom-synthesized by MWG Biotech (Munich, Germany). Previously, a pfk1 mutant could be isolated by its failure to grow on glucose as a sole carbon source in a strain already carrying a pfk2 defective allele (22Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This mutant showed a phosphofructokinase activity insensitive to allosteric inhibition by ATP when crossed back into a PFK2 wild-type background. To localize the mutation, we used PCR to amplify the complete coding region of PFK1 with its flanking sequences from the genome of the mutant strain gTI-4C (22Lobo Z. Maitra P.K. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two fragments were obtained from the PCR product by digestion with appropriate restriction endonucleases and used for subcloning in conjunction with wild type flanking PFK1 sequences in a yeast multicopy vector (Fig. 1; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Transformation into a pfk1 deletion strain and determination of Pfk activities in crude extracts revealed that the mutation conferring insensitivity to ATP inhibition was located in the 3′-part of the gene. Sequencing of this region showed a single base substitution at position 2184, leading to an exchange of proline 728 for a leucine in the deduced amino acid sequence. It should be noted that this exchange is close to a serine residue (position 724) previously identified as being involved in the binding of the allosteric activator fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (21Heinisch J.J. Boles E. Timpel C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15928-15933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In order to confirm that indeed a single exchange of proline 728 for leucine is responsible for the unusual allosteric behavior of the octameric Pfk enzyme, we proceeded by introducing the same exchange in the coding region of both PFK1 andPFK2 by in vitro-mutagenesis. We then constructed single-copy integrants of the mutant PFK alleles with only part of the sequence obtained from the PCR products, confirmed by sequencing to contain only the mutation introduced. For this purpose, single deletion mutants (pfk1::TRP1 andpfk2::URA3) of opposite mating type were used to integrate PFK1atp at the HIS3 locus and thePFK2atp mutant allele at the LEU2 locus, respectively. The resulting strains were crossed and subjected to tetrad analysis to obtain all possible combinations of PFKalleles (segregants from HD264, Table I (see supplemental material)). The strains were first tested for their specific phosphofructokinase activities under inhibitory and non-inhibitory conditions. Under optimized test conditions (i.e. at 1 mm ATP, 2.0 mm fructose 6-phosphate and in the presence of positive effectors), all strains displayed comparably high specific Pfk activities (Table III). It should be noted that the original non-isogenic mutant strain gTI-4C reaches only about 60% of the respective segregant (HD264-9B) in our isogenic series. Whereas Pfk activity was below the level of detection in crude extracts from wild-type cells under inhibitory test conditions (3 mm ATP, 0.2 mm fructose 6-phosphate, without effectors), all mutants retained considerable activities under such conditions.Table IIISpecific Pfk activities associated with mutant allelesStrainRelevant genotypeWithout effectors 1-aActivities were determined in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mmMgCl2 at 3 mm ATP, 0.2 mm fructose 6-phosphate.With effectors 1-bActivities were determined in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mmMgCl2 at 1 mm ATP, 2.0 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm ADP, 10 μm fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (note that specific activities in various determinations did not vary by more than 20%, whereas relative activities of the mutants as compared to the wild type varied by less than 10%).milliunits/mg proteinHD264–10APFK1 PFK2<5716HD264–7CPFK1atp PFK2atp pfk1∷TRP1 pfk2∷URA3241480HD264–10BPFK1atp PFK2atp pfk1∷TRP1 pfk2∷URA3277551HD264–9BPFK1atp PFK2 pfk1∷TRP1313677HD264–1CPFK2atp PFK1 pfk2∷URA3367857gTI-4CPFK1atp PFK21034121-a Activities were determined in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mmMgCl2 at 3 mm ATP, 0.2 mm fructose 6-phosphate.1-b Activities were determined in 50 mm K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 20 mmMgCl2 at 1 mm ATP, 2.0 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.5 mm AMP, 0.5 mm ADP, 10 μm fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (note that specific activities in various determinations did not vary by more than 20%, whereas relative activities of the mutants as compared to the wild type varied by less than 10%). Open table in a new tab As expected from previous works, strains carrying only one mutantPFK allele and being deleted for the gene encoding the other subunit did not show detectable Pfk activity in crude extracts. However, there were distinct growth phenotypes associated with the strains of our isogenic series (Fig. 2 A). Thus, all strains carrying two active PFK alleles (i.e. PFK1 PFK2, PFK1atp PFK2, PFK1 PFK2atp, orPFK1atp PFK2atp) grew normally on media containing glucose as a carbon source (compare also TableIV). When PFK2atp was the only functional PFK allele being present (pfk1::TRP1 PFK2atp), strains grew much more slowly on YEPD, whereas strains with only PFK1atp(PFK1atp pfk2::URA3) failed to grow on this medium. Mutant strains carrying either one or both PFKatpalleles showed a reduced capacity to grow on medium containing non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 2, A and C). This was not observed when the other PFK allele was deleted (pfk1::TRP1 PFK2atp; PFK1atp pfk2::URA3).Table IVGrowth rates and concentrations of metabolites in transformants carrying various mutant PFK allelesPFK allele 2-aStrains used in this experiment were: HD264–10A (PFK1 PFK2), HD264–7C (PFK1atp PFK2atp), HD264–9B (PFK1atp PFK2), and HD264–1C (PFK1 PFK2atp).μMetabolitesFru-2,6-P2SCYEPDATPGlc-6-PFru-6-PFru-1,6-P2h−1nmol/mg dry weightpmol/mg dry weightPFK1 PFK20.400.383.170.870.825.103.5PFK1atp PFK2atp0.400.463.320.920.876.531.9PFK1atp PFK20.400.403.300.800.844.522.9PFK1 PFK2atp0.380.443.250.561.076.405.4Cells were pregrown on YEP glycerol/ethanol (determination of growth rates) or on YNB glycerol/ethanol (determination of metabolite concentrations) overnight and than incubated for 2h in synthetic (SC) or rich medium (YEPD) with 2% Glc (growth rates) or for 2 h in synthetic medium with 4% Glc (metabolites).

Prolonged incubation on YEPD of the mutant strains resulted in distinct colony morphologies (Fig. 2 B). Whereas the wild-type strain formed smooth round colonies, the mutants displayed various degrees of sectoring, being most pronounced in the double mutant (PFK1atp PFK2atp), to a lesser degree in the PFK1atp PFK2mutant, and almost undetectable in the PFK1 PFK2atp mutant. Microscopic examination did not reveal any tendency to pseudohyphal growth at the colony borders. An altered colony morphology could be caused by a defect in ammonium signaling (35Palkova Z. Janderova B. Gabriel J. Zikanova B. Pospisek M. Forstova J. Nature. 1997; 390: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the sensitivity of our mutants to increasing concentrations of ammonium in the medium. In order to establish a possible connection of the regulation of the central glycolytic pathway with cell wall biosynthesis, we also tested drugs like caffeine and Congo Red. As evident from Fig. 2 C, all strains carrying PFK mutant alleles conferring insensitivity to ATP inhibition were more resistant to increasing concentrations of ammonium chloride. This also held true when we used ammonium sulfate (data not shown). Sodium chloride at similar concentrations did not show any inhibitory effect. With respect to caffeine, the PFK1atp PFK2 mutant and the single pfk1 deletion showed an increased resis"

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation is necessary but not sufficient for these metabolic actions of insulin. The insulin-stimulated translocation of phospho-c-Cbl to lipid rafts, via its association with CAP, comprises a second pathway regulating GLUT4 translocation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of a dominant negative CAP mutant (CAPΔSH3) completely blocked the insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis but only partially inhibited glycogen synthase activation. In contrast, CAPΔSH3 expression did not affect glycogen synthase activation by insulin in the absence of extracellular glucose. Moreover, CAPΔSH3 has no effect on the PI3K-dependent activation of protein phosphatase-1 or phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. These results indicate blockade of the c-Cbl/CAP pathway directly inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, which results in secondary inhibition of glycogen synthase activation and glycogen synthesis.

Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase (GS),1 the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis, is regulated by covalent and allosteric modification (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin promotes the net dephosphorylation of GS through the activation of glycogen-targeted protein-phosphatase-1 (PP1) and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). This action of insulin is facilitated by the stimulation of glucose uptake, since the resulting increase in glucose-6-phosphate leads to the allosteric activation of GS and increased susceptibility to PP1-mediated dephosphorylation (3Lawrence Jr., J.C. James C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7975-7982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cadefau J. Bollen M. Stalmans W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The stimulation of glucose disposal by insulin requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which leads to the increased activity of PIP3-dependent kinases such as Akt and protein kinase C ζ/λ (5Cohen P.

The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin blocks many of the metabolic actions of insulin, including the effects of the hormone on glucose transport and GS activities (7Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 8Shepherd P.R. Nave B.T. Siddle K. Biochem.

Moreover, both the inactivation of GSK-3 and the activation of PP1 are blocked by wortmannin (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem.

However, the activation of PI3K alone is not sufficient for insulin action, since other hormones and adhesion molecules can stimulate PI3K activity without reproducing the metabolic effects of insulin (12Wiese R.J.

Furthermore, cell-permeable derivatives of PIP3 do not fully mimic the effects of insulin on glucose transport (14Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, although the PI3K pathway is necessary, there is at least one additional pathway required for glucose transport regulation by insulin. The PI3K-independent pathway might involve the tyrosine phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene c-Cbl (15Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of c-Cbl by insulin requires the c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP), an adapter molecule that recruits c-Cbl to the insulin receptor (16Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CAP expression correlates with c-Cbl phosphorylation and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, expression of the CAP gene is increased by insulin-sensitizing activators of the nuclear receptor PPARγ (17Ribon V. Johnson J.H. Camp H.S. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14751-14756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These data suggest a potential link between CAP/Cbl and the metabolic actions of insulin. Upon phosphorylation, Cbl translocates to a Triton-insoluble lipid raft microdomain (18Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), where CAP binds to the caveolar protein flotillin (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, expression of a CAP mutant in which the SH3 domains have been deleted (CAPΔSH3) disrupted the formation of a CAP·flotillin·Cbl complex in lipid rafts, blocked translocation of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter GLUT4, and inhibited glucose transport, glycogen, and lipid synthesis (19Baumann C.A.

However, it remained unclear whether CAPΔSH3 directly blocked the signaling pathways involving GS dephosphorylation that are independent of glucose transport. We demonstrate here that the CAP/Cbl pathway regulates GS activation exclusively through a glucose-dependent mechanism.

After 30 min at 37 °C, 20 μm2-deoxy-d-[14C]glucose (∼20 cpm/pmol) was added to all wells. After 5 min at room temperature, the assay was terminated by the adding 50 μl of 200 mm 2-deoxyglucose and washing the cells 3 times with PBS on ice. Adipocytes were collected in 0.5 ml of distilled water. 10 μl of the cell suspension was retained to determine protein concentration and the remainder was subject to scintillation counting.

In some experiments, the cells were washed and incubated in glucose-free, low serum media immediately prior to insulin treatment.

Briefly, cells were treated in the absence and presence of 100 nm insulin for 15 min, and then 1 μCi of [14C]glucose (20 cpm/pmol) was added to all wells. After 45 min, cells were washed on ice with PBS, and glycogen was precipitated with 30% potassium hydroxide and quantitated by scintillation counting. Immunoblotting (22Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J.

J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were performed as described previously. Protein measurements were determined by the method of Bradford. CAPΔSH3 overexpression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly inhibits the translocation of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane, without affecting PI3K-dependent signals (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). To explore the implications of this result in more detail, we examined the effects of CAPΔSH3 expression on glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis over a range of insulin concentrations. In control LacZ-transfected 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin produced a 15-fold increase in glucose transport (Fig. 1 A) and a 10-fold increase in glycogen synthesis (Fig. 1 B). Overexpression of CAPΔSH3 decreased maximal glucose uptake by 40–50% (Fig.1 A). The construct blocked the responsiveness to insulin without effecting the EC50 for the hormone. Not surprisingly, CAPΔSH3 expression also blocked insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis (Fig. 1 B), which is dependent on increased glucose uptake under these conditions. Extrapolating for an average 50% transfection efficiency (data not shown), these results demonstrate that expression of CAPΔSH3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes produces a nearly complete inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. We next examined the effects of CAPΔSH3 expression on the regulation of GS activity by insulin. Electroporation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with CAPΔSH3 resulted in a 30% decrease in the activation of GS by insulin, compared with both LacZ- and CAP-expressing cells (Fig.2 A). In these experiments the electroporation efficiency was ∼50–60% (data not shown), indicating that CAPΔSH3 overexpression reduced GS activation by half. Previous studies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes indicated that removal of extracellular glucose also decreased the insulin-stimulated GS activity by 40–50% (20Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effect of CAPΔSH3 on GS activation may be secondary to inhibition of glucose transport. To evaluate this possibility directly, the electroporated adipocytes were incubated in glucose-free medium during the insulin treatment, and GS activity was assayed in vitro. Removal of extracellular glucose decreased insulin-stimulated GS activity by 40% in LacZ- and CAP-expressing cells (Fig. 2 B; compare with Fig. 2 A). However, CAPΔSH3 expression had no further inhibitory effect on GS activation by insulin. Thus, the glucose-independent pathway that mediates the dephosphorylation and subsequent activation of GS by insulin appears not to involve the CAP/Cbl pathway. The PI3K inhibitor wortmannin completely blocked the regulation of GS, PP1, and GSK-3 by insulin (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, pretreatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 200 nm wortmannin did not significantly change the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl (Fig.3 A). However, wortmannin pretreatment of transfected cells incubated in glucose-free media completely blocked the residual activation of GS by insulin (Fig. 3 B). Thus, a PI3K-dependent pathway is likely to trigger the glucose-independent activation of GS. Insulin promotes the activation of GS by decreasing the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. Both the activation of glycogen-targeted PP1 and the inactivation of GSK-3 have been proposed to mediate this effect of the hormone (5Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of CAPΔSH3 expression on the regulation of these enzymes by insulin. Electroporation of LacZ, CAP, or CAPΔSH3 into 3T3-L1 adipocytes had no effect on the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3 (Fig.4A), which results in enzymatic inactivation (24Welsh G.I. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Insulin treatment of LacZ-electroporated cells also caused a 50% increase in PP1 activity (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of either CAP or CAPΔSH3 had no effect on PP1 activation by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4 B). These results cumulatively indicate that the CAP/Cbl pathway is not necessary for the insulin-mediated regulation of enzymes that covalently modify GS. Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis in muscle and fat by a coordinate increase in GLUT4 vesicle translocation and covalent modification of glycogen metabolizing enzymes (1Brady M.J. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 10: 408-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Insulin promotes the dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase, resulting in enzymatic activation and inactivation, respectively. Both phosphatase activation and kinase inactivation contribute to the dephosphorylation of both proteins in response to insulin. Additionally, increased glucose-6-phosphate levels allosterically activate GS, overriding inhibition caused by phosphorylation (2Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roach P.J. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 541-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, glucose metabolites induce the translocation of cytosolic GS to glycogen-containing fractions in primary hepatocytes (25Fernandez-Novell J.M. Arino J. Vilaro S. Bellido D. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), skeletal muscle (26Nielsen, J. N., Derave, W., Kristiansen, S., Ralston, E., Ploug, T., and Richter, E. A. (2001) J. Physiol., in press.Google Scholar), and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (20Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Insulin therefore activates GS through covalent modification, allosteric activation, and enzymatic translocation. However, the complex interplay between insulin signaling cascades, elevated levels of glucose, and its metabolites and glycogen stores in the regulation of GS activity and glycogen synthesis rates remains unclear. The activation of PI3K and downstream serine/threonine kinases plays an important role in the hormonal regulation of glucose uptake and storage. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K blocked the stimulation of glucose transport (7Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism, such as GS, PP1, and GSK-3 (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, overexpression of PI3K or downstream enzymatic effectors in cells partially increased glucose uptake (27Tanti J.F. Gremeaux T. Grillo S. Calleja V. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25227-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PI3K activation is not sufficient to mediate changes in glucose metabolism produced by insulin (12Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 13Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), implicating a second signaling pathway. The PI3K-independent arm of insulin action may result from the phosphorylation of c-Cbl via its association with CAP. Insulin stimulated c-Cbl phosphorylation and translocation of the Cbl·CAP complex to lipid rafts, where CAP directly bound flotillin (15Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The insulin-dependent localization of phospho-Cbl to subdomains of the plasma membrane resulted in the generation of signaling pathways involved in GLUT4 translocation. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, overexpression of the dominant negative CAP mutant, CAPΔSH3, specifically blocked the insulin-mediated translocation of phospho-Cbl into lipid rafts and completely inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (19Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the insulin-mediated phosphorylation and translocation of Cbl were not blocked by PI3K inhibitors (Fig. 3 A, data not shown), indicating that the Cbl·CAP·flotillin axis may comprise the PI3K-independent pathway regulating glucose transport. Overexpression of the dominant negative mutant CAPΔSH3 completely blocked insulin-stimulated glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, correcting for transfection efficiency (Fig. 1,A and B). Further, CAPΔSH3 overexpression also reduced insulin-mediated GS activation by 50% (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, this effect was solely the result of reduced glucose uptake, because CAPΔSH3 did not block GS activation in the absence of extracellular glucose (Figs. 2 B and3 B). Moreover, the inhibition of GSK-3 and activation of PP1 by insulin were unaffected by CAPΔSH3 expression (Fig. 4,A and B), whereas the glucose-independent activation of GS by insulin was completely suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (Fig. 3 B). In primary adipocytes, insulin and glucose synergistically promote the dephosphorylation and activation of GS (29Lawrence Jr., J.C. Larner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2104-2113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of extracellular glucose decreases insulin-stimulated GS activation by 40% in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2 B) (20Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27497-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, blockade of glucose transport by CAPΔSH3 overexpression caused a 50% reduction in GS activation by insulin. However, the regulation of GSK-3 and PP1 by insulin was unaffected by CAPΔSH3, indicating that these enzymes may constitute the other 50% of GS activation. In agreement, the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, which completely blocks the effects of insulin on GSK-3 and PP1 activities (10Hurel S.J. Rochford J.J. Borthwick A.C. Wells A.M. Vandenheede J.R. Turnbull D.M. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), also blocked the glucose-independent activation of GS (Fig. 3 B). Cumulatively, these results indicate that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin utilizes glucose-dependent and independent pathways to regulate GS activity. In parallel, insulin initiates PI3K-dependent and -independent signaling pathways to mobilize GLUT4 translocation. Blockade of the PI3K-independent, CAP/Cbl-dependent insulin pathway through CAPΔSH3 expression inhibits GLUT4 translocation and the glucose-dependent component of GS activation by insulin. In contrast, pharmacological inactivation of PI3K blocks both insulin-mediated stimulation of glucose transport and regulation of PP1 and GSK-3 activities, resulting in a complete inhibition of GS activation. Whether insulin also utilizes a PI3K-independent pathway to regulate PP1 and GSK-3 activities is presently under investigation."
