Although reduced growth of juvenile corals in acidified seawater has been reported, coral larvae have been reported to demonstrate some level of tolerance to reduced pH. We hypothesize that the observed tolerance of coral larvae to low pH may be partly explained by reduced metabolic rates in acidified seawater because both calcifying and non-calcifying marine invertebrates could show metabolic depression under reduced pH in order to enhance their survival. In this study, after 3-d and 7-d exposure to three different pH levels (8.0, 7.6, and 7.3), we found that the oxygen consumption of Acropora digitifera larvae tended to be suppressed with reduced pH, although a statistically significant difference was not observed between pH conditions. Larval metamorphosis was also observed, confirming that successful recruitment is impaired when metamorphosis is disrupted, despite larval survival. Results also showed that the metamorphosis rate significantly decreased under acidified seawater conditions after both short (2 h) and long (7 d) term exposure. These results imply that acidified seawater impacts larval physiology, suggesting that suppressed metabolism and metamorphosis may alter the dispersal potential of larvae and subsequently reduce the resilience of coral communities in the near future as the ocean pH decreases."
https://openalex.org/W2043879952,"The actin cytoskeleton of dendritic spines plays a key role in morphological aspects of synaptic plasticity. The detailed analysis of the spine structure and dynamics in live neurons, however, has been hampered by the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional fluorescence microscopy. The advent of nanoscopic imaging techniques thus holds great promise for the study of these processes. We implemented a strategy for the visualization of morphological changes of dendritic spines over tens of minutes at a lateral resolution of 25 to 65 nm. We have generated a low-affinity photoconvertible probe, capable of reversibly binding to actin and thus allowing long-term photoactivated localization microscopy of the spine cytoskeleton. Using this approach, we resolve structural parameters of spines and record their long-term dynamics at a temporal resolution below one minute. Furthermore, we have determined changes in the spine morphology in response to pharmacologically induced synaptic activity and quantified the actin redistribution underlying these changes. By combining PALM imaging with quantum dot tracking, we could also simultaneously visualize the cytoskeleton and the spine membrane, allowing us to record complementary information on the morphological changes of the spines at super-resolution."

We now demonstrate that Prdx6 is required for agonist-induced NOX2 activation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) and that the effect requires the PLA2 activity of Prdx6. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was markedly reduced in perfused lungs and isolated PMVEC from Prdx6 null mice. Rac1 and p47phox, cytosolic components of NOX2, translocated to the endothelial cell membrane after Ang II treatment in wild-type but not Prdx6 null PMVEC. MJ33, an inhibitor of Prdx6 PLA2 activity, blocked agonist-induced PLA2 activity and ROS generation in PMVEC by >80%, whereas inhibitors of other PLA2s were ineffective. Transfection of Prx6 null cells with wild-type and C47S mutant Prdx6, but not with mutants of the PLA2 active site (S32A, H26A, and D140A), “rescued” Ang II-induced PLA2 activity and ROS generation. Ang II treatment of wild-type cells resulted in phosphorylation of Prdx6 and its subsequent translocation from the cytosol to the cell membrane. Phosphorylation as well as PLA2 activity and ROS generation were markedly reduced by the MAPK inhibitor, U0126. Thus, agonist-induced MAPK activation leads to Prdx6 phosphorylation and translocation to the cell membrane, where its PLA2 activity facilitates assembly of the NOX2 complex and activation of the oxidase.

For example, H2O2 modulates cell growth, apoptosis, and various other endothelial cell functions (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid.

Biol. 2010; 30: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). NADPH oxidases (NOXs) are a family of seven widely distributed enzymes that enzymatically generate O2⨪ and, through dismutation, H2O2 (3Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Of these, NOX2 is the canonical NOX responsible for O2⨪ generation by the respiratory burst in neutrophils. NOX2 is also found in other cell types and is a major source of ROS in endothelial cells (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the unstimulated state, NOX2 is quiescent, with the intrinsic membrane subunits (cytochrome b558 comprising gp91phox and p22phox) and cytosolic subunits (Rac1, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox) confined to their respective compartments (4Pendyala S. Usatyuk P.V. Gorshkova I.A. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 841-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Activation of the enzyme complex by stimuli such as angiotensin II (Ang II), phorbol esters, or thrombin leads to translocation of the cytosolic components to the plasma membrane, resulting in assembly of the oxidase complex. Cytochrome b558 with its heme, NADPH, and flavin binding sites functions to transfer electrons from NADPH to oxygen, thereby generating O2⨪ in the extracellular space. Dismutation of O2⨪, either catalyzed or spontaneous, generates H2O2, which is regarded as the primary ROS signaling molecule in endothelium (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar).Peroxiredoxins are a family of antioxidants that express peroxidase activity and catalyze the removal of H2O2 and other hydroperoxides (5Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Of the six mammalian members of the family, peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only peroxiredoxin with both phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and peroxidase activities (6Fisher A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). The PLA2 activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of the acyl group at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, with special affinity for phosphatidylcholine, to produce free fatty acids and a lysophospholipid; the peroxidase activity uses glutathione as the co-factor for reduction of hydroperoxides, including phospholipid hydroperoxides (6Fisher A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). In a previous study, Prdx6 (therein called p29) was found to participate in the activation of NOX2 in human neutrophils (7Leavey P.J. Gonzalez-Aller C. Thurman G. Kleinberg M. Rinckel L. Ambruso D.W. Freeman S. Kuypers F.A. Ambruso D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45181-45187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Prdx6 might activate NOX2-mediated ROS generation was not determined. Here, we investigated the role of Prdx6 in NOX2 activation in alveolar macrophages and in the endothelium in situ and in vitro. We found that phosphorylation of Prdx6 through MAPK activity causes its translocation to the cell membrane, and the resultant PLA2 activity leads to assembly of the NOX2 enzyme complex and ROS generation.DISCUSSIONNOX2 has been well established as the major source of ROS generation in PMN and macrophages (3Lambeth J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although NOX2 was originally considered as a protein complex exclusive to these phagocytic cells, there is compelling evidence to indicate that NOX2 expression is widely distributed, and it is now considered as the major enzyme system for ROS generation in vascular endothelial cells (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). NOX2 consists of membrane and cytosolic components that, in response to a wide variety of agonists, assemble at the plasma membrane, thereby activating the enzyme to produce O2⨪. However, the exact mechanisms that drive this assembly are not known. What is clear is that NOX2 assembly can be initiated by pathways involving either a receptor- or non-receptor-mediated process (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 791-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 4Pendyala S. Usatyuk P.V. Gorshkova I.A. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 841-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). An example of the former is Ang II that works through its receptor subtypes AT1 and AT2 to activate downstream signaling pathways, whereas non-receptor-mediated agonists include the phorbol esters (e.g. PMA) that directly stimulate PKC. In this study, we used both Ang II and PMA to activate NOX2-dependent ROS production by intact perfused lungs or isolated PMVEC. With either agonist, NOX2 activation did not occur in the absence of Prdx6 and was rescued by transfection of Prdx6 null cells with a construct expressing wild-type Prdx6. Thus, we conclude that Prdx6 is essential for NOX2 activation and ROS production in endothelial cells. A similar Prdx6 requirement was demonstrated for agonist-mediated ROS production by alveolar macrophages.A similar conclusion regarding a role for Prdx6 in NOX2 activation was reached in a previous in vitro study of PMN in which ROS production was approximately doubled by the presence of recombinant Prdx6 (also known as p29); this latter study used a reconstituted system consisting of isolated plasma membrane from PMN and recombinant cytosolic proteins (7Leavey P.J. Gonzalez-Aller C. Thurman G. Kleinberg M. Rinckel L. Ambruso D.W. Freeman S. Kuypers F.A. Ambruso D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45181-45187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although the recombinant Prdx6 (p29) exhibited both PLA2 and peroxidase activities, neither activity could be conclusively associated with NOX2 activation, which raised the possibility that enhancement of NOX2 activity by Prdx6 was unrelated to either enzymatic activity. However, the present study using PMVEC shows conclusively that Prdx6 facilitates NOX2 assembly and activation through its PLA2 activity. Evidence to support this mechanism is provided by the following findings: 1) activation of PLA2 activity with agonist (Ang II, PMA) stimulation in wild-type but not Prdx6 null cells; 2) the rescue of Ang II response by transfection of Prdx6 null cells with constructs leading to the expression of Prdx6 with PLA2 activity, whereas constructs that did not lead to PLA2 activity were ineffective; and 3) the inhibition of activation in the presence of the PLA2 inhibitor, MJ33. Thus, we conclude that the essential role of Prdx6 is associated with its PLA2 activity.Our previous studies have demonstrated that Prdx6 has its peak PLA2 activity at pH 4 with minimal activity at cytosolic pH (20Kim T.S. Dodia C. Chen X. Hennigan B.B. Jain M. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L750-L761PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen J.W. Dodia C. Feinstein S.I. Jain M.K. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28421-28427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This finding correlated with the ability of Prdx6 to bind to native phospholipid substrate (liposomes) at acidic but not neutral pH (22Manevich Y. Reddy K.S. Shuvaeva T. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2306-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 25Manevich Y. Shuvaeva T. Dodia C. Kazi A. Feinstein S.I. Fisher A.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 485: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, lipid binding at pH 7 and subsequent PLA2 activity were markedly enhanced by phosphorylation of the protein (8Wu Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Chowdhury I. Pak J.H. Kazi A. Dodia C. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Prdx6 phosphorylation was shown in lung epithelial cells in response to PMA as determined by immunoprecipitation and was blocked by inhibition of MAPKs (8Wu Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Chowdhury I. Pak J.H. Kazi A. Dodia C. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study, Prdx6 phosphorylation and its association with the endothelial cell plasma membrane (presumably as a result of binding to membrane lipids) were demonstrated subsequent to treatment of PMVEC with Ang II. The plasma membrane association was shown by immunofluorescence, immunoblot, and the Duolink procedure using an antibody to phosphorylated Prdx6. Further, Prdx6 translocation, PLA2 activity, and activation of NOX2 were blocked in the presence of U0126, an inhibitor of ERK MAPK activation and shown previously to inhibit Prdx6 phosphorylation (8Wu Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Chowdhury I. Pak J.H. Kazi A. Dodia C. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The requirement for phosphorylation of Prdx6 was confirmed by transfection with a construct expressing a Thr177 mutant into Prdx6 null cells. Thr177 is the unique site of protein phosphorylation when recombinant protein is treated in vitro with MAPKs (ERK, p38) (8Wu Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Chowdhury I. Pak J.H. Kazi A. Dodia C. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In distinction from transfection with the wild-type construct, transfection with a construct expressing the T177A mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated (8Wu Y. Feinstein S.I. Manevich Y. Chowdhury I. Pak J.H. Kazi A. Dodia C. Speicher D.W. Fisher A.B. Biochem. J. 2009; 419: 669-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was unable to rescue Ang II activation of NOX2 despite exhibiting basal PLA2 activity that was about 50% of the wild-type activity. Thus, we conclude that Prdx6 phosphorylation is required for NOX2 activation.This study has not investigated which product of PLA2 activity is responsible for NOX2 activation. PLA2 liberates both a free fatty acid and lyso-PC from phosphatidylcholine substrate, and previous studies have provided evidence that either metabolite might be directly or indirectly responsible for initiating the events leading to activation of the NOX2 pathway (30Bostan M. Galatiuc C. Hirt M. Constantin M.C. Brasoveanu L.I. Iordachescu D. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol.

Of note, Prdx6 does not show a preference for arachidonate-containing phospholipids so that arachidonic acid would not be preferentially liberated by Prdx6 PLA2 activity (24Akiba S. Dodia C. Chen X. Fisher A.B. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 120: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, the specific product of PLA2 activity that mediates NOX2 activation remains unresolved.Previous studies have provided evidence that PLA2 activity is important for NOX2 activation in PMN and possibly endothelial and other cell types (30Bostan M. Galatiuc C. Hirt M. Constantin M.C. Brasoveanu L.I. Iordachescu D. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 33Rao G.N. Lassègue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K.

Johnson D.K. Ziegler L.M. DiMattina A.J. Stone R.I. Holland J.A. Endothelium. 2003; 10: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, assessment of the specific PLA2 involved in activation has been hampered by the relative non-specificity of inhibitors used in many of the earlier studies. Although the member of the PLA2 family that might be responsible for NOX2 activation was not identified precisely, suspicion has focused on cytoplasmic PLA2 (cPLA2) (36Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 37Zhao X. Bey E.A. Wientjes F.B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25385-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). cPLA2 is ubiquitously expressed in cells and demonstrates a preference for arachidonate-containing phospholipids as the substrate; release of arachidonic acid can give rise to the broad spectrum of eicosanoid metabolites. cPLA2 can be phosphorylated by MAPKs and translocates to the cell membrane, similar to the pathway we have described herein for Prdx6 (36Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L. Eitan-Hazan Z. Hershfinkel M. Levy R. J. Cell. Biol. 2003; 162: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cPLA2 and release of arachidonic acid were demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle cells stimulated with Ang II, although this was not directly linked to NOX2 activation (33Rao G.N. Lassègue B. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ROS production by endothelial cells activated with low density lipoprotein was inhibited by the presence of the cPLA2 inhibitor, AACOCF3 (35O'Donnell R.W. Johnson D.K. Ziegler L.M. DiMattina A.J. Stone R.I. Holland J.A. Endothelium. 2003; 10: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The possible role for cPLA2 in NOX2 activation in PMN and monocytes has been inferred by its presence on the plasma membrane following stimulation and by decreased ROS production when expression of cPLA2 was “knocked down” with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (31Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 36Shmelzer Z. Haddad N. Admon E. Pessach I. Leto T.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 25385-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the effects of AACOCF3 on ROS production with PMN stimulated by PMA were unimpressive (30Bostan M. Galatiuc C. Hirt M. Constantin M.C. Brasoveanu L.I. Iordachescu D. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2003; 7: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Further, deletion of cPLA2 by gene targeting did not alter NOX2 activation in PMN or peritoneal macrophages treated with various agonists, including opsonized zymosan, PMA, and formyl-MLF peptide (39Rubin B.B. Downey G.P. Koh A. Degousee N. Ghomashchi F. Nallan L. Stefanski E. Harkin D.W. Sun C. Smart B.P. Lindsay T.F. Cherepanov V. Vachon E. Kelvin D. Sadilek M. Brown G.E. Yaffe M.B. Plumb J. Grinstein S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20146-20156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These latter results indicate that a role for cPLA2 in activation of NOX2 in phagocytes is unlikely. In the present study, AACOCF3 did not block the ROS response to Ang II or PMA in PMVEC. Thus, cPLA2 is not involved in Ang II- or PMA-mediated NOX2 activation in endothelial cells, although a role for cPLA2 in response to other agonists cannot be excluded.In summary, this study has shown that Prdx6 is required for activation of NOX2 in mouse PMVEC stimulated with Ang II or PMA and alveolar macrophages stimulated with concanavalin A or fMLF. Exposure of PMVEC to agonists results in MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Prdx6, its translocation to the cell membrane, and activation of phospholipase A2 activity that leads to translocation of NOX2 cytoplasmic components and activation of the enzyme complex.

Of the six mammalian members of the family, peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only peroxiredoxin with both phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and peroxidase activities (6Fisher A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). The PLA2 activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of the acyl group at the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, with special affinity for phosphatidylcholine, to produce free fatty acids and a lysophospholipid; the peroxidase activity uses glutathione as the co-factor for reduction of hydroperoxides, including phospholipid hydroperoxides (6Fisher A.B. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar). In a previous study, Prdx6 (therein called p29) was found to participate in the activation of NOX2 in human neutrophils (7Leavey P.J.

Here, we investigated the role of Prdx6 in NOX2 activation in alveolar macrophages and in the endothelium in situ and in vitro. We found that phosphorylation of Prdx6 through MAPK activity causes its translocation to the cell membrane, and the resultant PLA2 activity leads to assembly of the NOX2 enzyme complex and ROS generation.

NOX2 is also found in other cell types and is a major source of ROS in endothelial cells (1Frey R.S. Ushio-Fukai M. Malik A.B. Antioxid.

In the unstimulated state, NOX2 is quiescent, with the intrinsic membrane subunits (cytochrome b558 comprising gp91phox and p22phox) and cytosolic subunits (Rac1, p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox) confined to their respective compartments (4Pendyala S.

https://openalex.org/W2015483723,"The ubiquitously distributed MAP1S is a homologue of the exclusively neuronal distributed microtubule-associated protein 1A and 1B (MAP1A/B). They give rise to multiple isoforms through similar post-translational modification. Isoforms of MAP1S have been implicated in microtubule dynamics and mitotic abnormalities and mitotic cell death. Here we show that ablation of the <i>Map1s</i> gene in mice caused reduction in the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 or xL (Bcl-2/xL) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (P27) protein levels, accumulation of defective mitochondria, and severe defects in response to nutritive stress, suggesting defects in autophagosomal biogenesis and clearance. Furthermore, MAP1S isoforms interacted with the autophagosome-associated light chain 3 of MAP1A/B (LC3), a homologue of yeast autophagy-related gene 8 (ATG8), and recruited it to stable microtubules in a MAP1S and LC3 isoform-dependent mode. In addition, MAP1S interacted with mitochondrion-associated leucine-rich PPR-motif containing protein (LRPPRC) that interacts with the mitophagy initiator and Parkinson disease-related protein Parkin. The three-way interactions of MAP1S isoforms with LC3 and microtubules as well as the interaction of MAP1S with LRPPRC suggest that MAP1S isoforms may play positive roles in integration of autophagic components with microtubules and mitochondria in both autophagosomal biogenesis and degradation. For the first time, our results clarify roles of MAP1S in bridging microtubules and mitochondria with autophagic and mitophagic initiation, maturation, trafficking, and lysosomal clearance. Defects in the MAP1S-regulated autophagy may impact heart disease, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and a wide range of other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2089685254,"The impermeant nature of the intestinal barrier is maintained by tight junctions (TJs) formed between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells. Disruption of TJs and loss of barrier function are associated with a number of gastrointestinal diseases, including neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal diseases in preterm infants. Human milk is protective against NEC, and the human milk factor erythropoietin (Epo) has been shown to protect endothelial cell-cell and blood-brain barriers. We hypothesized that Epo may also protect intestinal epithelial barriers, thereby lowering the incidence of NEC. Our data demonstrate that Epo protects enterocyte barrier function by supporting expression of the TJ protein ZO-1. As immaturity is a key factor in NEC, Epo regulation of ZO-1 in the human fetal immature H4 intestinal epithelial cell line was examined and demonstrated Epo-stimulated ZO-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner through the PI3K/Akt pathway. In a rat NEC model, oral administration of Epo lowered the incidence of NEC from 45 to 23% with statistical significance. In addition, Epo treatment protected intestinal barrier function and prevented loss of ZO-1 at the TJs in vivo. These effects were associated with elevated Akt phosphorylation in the intestine. This study reveals a novel role of Epo in the regulation of intestinal epithelial TJs and barrier function and suggests the possible use of enteral Epo as a therapeutic agent for gut diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2013614229,"Maintenance of healthy mitochondria prevents aging, cancer, and a variety of degenerative diseases that are due to the result of defective mitochondrial quality control (MQC). Recently, we discovered a novel mechanism for MQC, in which Mieap induces intramitochondrial lysosome-like organella that plays a critical role in the elimination of oxidized mitochondrial proteins (designated MALM for Mieap-induced accumulation of lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria). However, a large part of the mechanisms for MQC remains unknown. Here, we report additional mechanisms for Mieap-regulated MQC. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers completely inhibited MALM. A mitochondrial outer membrane protein NIX interacted with Mieap in a ROS-dependent manner via the BH3 domain of NIX and the coiled-coil domain of Mieap. Deficiency of NIX also completely impaired MALM. When MALM was inhibited, Mieap induced vacuole-like structures (designated as MIV for Mieap-induced vacuole), which engulfed and degraded the unhealthy mitochondria by accumulating lysosomes. The inactivation of p53 severely impaired both MALM and MIV generation, leading to accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria. These results suggest that (1) mitochondrial ROS and NIX are essential factors for MALM, (2) MIV is a novel mechanism for lysosomal degradation of mitochondria, and (3) the p53-Mieap pathway plays a pivotal role in MQC by repairing or eliminating unhealthy mitochondria via MALM or MIV generation, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2013469097,"Tubulin post-translational modifications generate microtubule heterogeneity and modulate microtubule function, and are catalyzed by tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) proteins. Using antibodies specific to monoglycylated, polyglycylated, and glutamylated tubulin in whole mount immunostaining of zebrafish embryos, we observed distinct, tissue-specific patterns of tubulin modifications. Tubulin modification patterns in cilia correlated with the expression of ttll3 and ttll6 in ciliated cells. Expression screening of all zebrafish tubulin tyrosine ligase-like genes revealed additional tissue-specific expression of ttll1 in brain neurons, ttll4 in muscle, and ttll7 in otic placodes. Knockdown of ttll3 eliminated cilia tubulin glycylation but had surprisingly mild effects on cilia structure and motility. Similarly, knockdown of ttll6 strongly reduced cilia tubulin glutamylation but only partially affected cilia structure and motility. Combined loss of function of ttll3 and ttll6 caused near complete loss of cilia motility and induced a variety of axonemal ultrastructural defects similar to defects previously observed in zebrafish fleer mutants, which were shown to lack tubulin glutamylation. Consistently, we find that fleer mutants also lack tubulin glycylation. These results indicate that tubulin glycylation and glutamylation have overlapping functions in maintaining cilia structure and motility and that the fleer/dyf-1 TPR protein is required for both types of tubulin post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W2038846484,"Background Antibodies that protect against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria are only acquired after years of repeated infections. The B cell biology that underlies this observation is poorly understood. We previously reported that “atypical” memory B cells are increased in children and adults exposed to intense Pf transmission in Mali, similar to what has been observed in individuals infected with HIV. In this study we examined B cell subsets of Pf -infected adults in Peru and Mali to determine if Pf transmission intensity correlates with atypical memory B cell expansion. Methodology/Principal Findings In this cross-sectional study venous blood was collected from adults in areas of zero (U.S., n = 10), low (Peru, n = 18) and high (Mali, n = 12) Pf transmission. Adults in Peru and Mali were infected with Pf at the time of blood collection. Thawed lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify B cell subsets, including atypical memory B cells, defined by the cell surface markers CD19+ CD20+ CD21− CD27− CD10−. In Peru, the mean level of atypical memory B cells, as a percent of total B cells, was higher than U.S. adults (Peru mean: 5.4% [95% CI: 3.61–7.28]; U.S. mean: 1.4% [95% CI: 0.92–1.81]; p<0.0001) but lower than Malian adults (Mali mean 13.1% [95% CI: 10.68–15.57]; p = 0.0001). In Peru, individuals self-reporting ≥1 prior malaria episodes had a higher percentage of atypical memory B cells compared to those reporting no prior episodes (≥1 prior episodes mean: 6.6% [95% CI: 4.09–9.11]; no prior episodes mean: 3.1% [95% CI: 1.52–4.73]; p = 0.028). Conclusions/Significance Compared to Pf-naive controls, atypical memory B cells were increased in Peruvian adults exposed to low Pf transmission, and further increased in Malian adults exposed to intense Pf transmission. Understanding the origin, function and antigen specificity of atypical memory B cells in the context of Pf infection could contribute to our understanding of naturally-acquired malaria immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2087428022,"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (Lb. bulgaricus) is an important species of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) used for cheese and yogurt fermentation. The genome of Lb. bulgaricus 2038, an industrial strain mainly used for yogurt production, was completely sequenced and compared against the other two ATCC collection strains of the same subspecies. Specific physiological properties of strain 2038, such as lysine biosynthesis, formate production, aspartate-related carbon-skeleton intermediate metabolism, unique EPS synthesis and efficient DNA restriction/modification systems, are all different from those of the collection strains that might benefit the industrial production of yogurt. Other common features shared by Lb. bulgaricus strains, such as efficient protocooperation with Streptococcus thermophilus and lactate production as well as well-equipped stress tolerance mechanisms may account for it being selected originally for yogurt fermentation industry. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that Lb. bulgaricus 2038 was genetically closer to the common ancestor of the subspecies than the other two sequenced collection strains, probably due to a strict industrial maintenance process for strain 2038 that might have halted its genome decay and sustained a gene network suitable for large scale yogurt production."
https://openalex.org/W1973297914,"Ecological traps form when artificial structures are added to natural habitats and induce mismatches between habitat preferences and fitness consequences. Their existence in terrestrial systems has been documented, yet little evidence suggests they occur in marine environments. Coastal fish farms are widespread artificial structures in coastal ecosystems and are highly attractive to wild fish.To investigate if coastal salmon farms act as ecological traps for wild Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and saithe (Pollachius virens), we compared proxy measures of fitness between farm-associated fish and control fish caught distant from farms in nine locations throughout coastal Norway, the largest coastal fish farming industry in the world. Farms modified wild fish diets in both quality and quantity, thereby providing farm-associated wild fish with a strong trophic subsidy. This translated to greater somatic (saithe: 1.06-1.12 times; cod: 1.06-1.11 times) and liver condition indices (saithe: 1.4-1.8 times; cod: 2.0-2.8 times) than control fish caught distant from farms. Parasite loads of farm-associated wild fish were modified from control fish, with increased external and decreased internal parasites, however the strong effect of the trophic subsidy overrode any effects of altered loads upon condition.Proxy measures of fitness provided no evidence that salmon farms function as ecological traps for wild fish. We suggest fish farms may act as population sources for wild fish, provided they are protected from fishing while resident at farms to allow their increased condition to manifest as greater reproductive output."

We previously demonstrated that the injection of S14G-HN, a highly potent HN derivative, into brain ameliorated memory loss in an Abeta-injection mouse model. To fully understand HN's functions under AD-associated pathological conditions, we examined the effect of S14G-HN on triple transgenic mice harboring APPswe, tauP310L, and PS-1M146V that show the age-dependent development of multiple pathologies relating to AD. After 3 months of intranasal treatment, behavioral analyses showed that S14G-HN ameliorated cognitive impairment in male mice. Moreover, ELISA and immunohistochemical analyses showed that Abeta levels in brains were markedly lower in S14G-HN-treated male and female mice than in vehicle control mice. We also found the expression level of neprilysin, an Abeta degrading enzyme, in the outer molecular layer of hippocampal formation was increased in S14G-HN-treated mouse brains. NEP activity was also elevated by S14G-HN treatment in vitro. These findings suggest that decreased Abeta level in these mice is at least partly attributed to S14G-HN-induced increase of neprilysin level. Although HN was identified as an anti-neuronal death factor, these results indicate that HN may also have a therapeutic effect on amyloid accumulation in AD."
https://openalex.org/W2029671948,"Background So far, human antibodies with good affinity and specificity for MUC1, a transmembrane protein overexpressed on breast cancers and ovarian carcinomas, and thus a promising target for therapy, were very difficult to generate. Results A human scFv antibody was isolated from an immune library derived from breast cancer patients immunised with MUC1. The anti-MUC1 scFv reacted with tumour cells in more than 80% of 228 tissue sections of mamma carcinoma samples, while showing very low reactivity with a large panel of non-tumour tissues. By mutagenesis and phage display, affinity of scFvs was increased up to 500fold to 5,7×10−10 M. Half-life in serum was improved from below 1 day to more than 4 weeks and was correlated with the dimerisation tendency of the individual scFvs. The scFv bound to T47D and MCF-7 mammalian cancer cell lines were recloned into the scFv-Fc and IgG format resulting in decrease of affinity of one binder. The IgG variants with the highest affinity were tested in mouse xenograft models using MCF-7 and OVCAR tumour cells. However, the experiments showed no significant decrease in tumour growth or increase in the survival rates. To study the reasons for the failure of the xenograft experiments, ADCC was analysed in vitro using MCF-7 and OVCAR3 target cells, revealing a low ADCC, possibly due to internalisation, as detected for MCF-7 cells. Conclusions Antibody phage display starting with immune libraries and followed by affinity maturation is a powerful strategy to generate high affinity human antibodies to difficult targets, in this case shown by the creation of a highly specific antibody with subnanomolar affinity to a very small epitope consisting of four amino acids. Despite these “best in class” binding parameters, the therapeutic success of this antibody was prevented by the target biology."

Little is known about the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) affecting the signaling activity of FLT3. To identify such PTP, myeloid cells expressing wild type FLT3 were infected with a panel of lentiviral pseudotypes carrying shRNA expression cassettes targeting different PTP. Out of 20 PTP tested, expressed in hematopoietic cells, or presumed to be involved in oncogenesis or tumor suppression, DEP-1 (PTPRJ) was identified as a PTP negatively regulating FLT3 phosphorylation and signaling. Stable 32D myeloid cell lines with strongly reduced DEP-1 levels showed site-selective hyperphosphorylation of FLT3. In particular, the sites pTyr-589, pTyr-591, and pTyr-842 involved in the FLT3 ligand (FL)-mediated activation of FLT3 were hyperphosphorylated the most. Similarly, acute depletion of DEP-1 in the human AML cell line THP-1 caused elevated FLT3 phosphorylation. Direct interaction of DEP-1 and FLT3 was demonstrated by “substrate trapping” experiments showing association of DEP-1 D1205A or C1239S mutant proteins with FLT3 by co-immunoprecipitation. Moreover, activated FLT3 could be dephosphorylated by recombinant DEP-1 in vitro. Enhanced FLT3 phosphorylation in DEP-1-depleted cells was accompanied by enhanced FLT3-dependent activation of ERK and cell proliferation. Stable overexpression of DEP-1 in 32D cells and transient overexpression with FLT3 in HEK293 cells resulted in reduction of FL-mediated FLT3 signaling activity. Furthermore, FL-stimulated colony formation of 32D cells expressing FLT3 in methylcellulose was induced in response to shRNA-mediated DEP-1 knockdown. This transforming effect of DEP-1 knockdown was consistent with a moderately increased activation of STAT5 upon FL stimulation but did not translate into myeloproliferative disease formation in the 32D-C3H/HeJ mouse model. The data indicate that DEP-1 is negatively regulating FLT3 signaling activity and that its loss may contribute to but is not sufficient for leukemogenic cell transformation.

Böhmer F.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Some PTP, notably SHP-2, have been found to positively influence growth-stimulatory signaling pathways, and mutations leading to gain-of-function of these PTP can potentially be oncogenic. It has been demonstrated that SHP-2 directly interacts with FLT3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner via phosphotyrosine 599. SHP-2 contributes to FL-mediated ERK activation and proliferation (18Müller J.P. Schönherr C. Markova B. Bauer R. Stocking C. Böhmer F.D. Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Heiss E. Masson K. Sundberg C. Pedersen M. Sun J. Bengtsson S. Rönnstrand L. Blood. 2006; 108: 1542-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but it appears dispensable for cell transformation by the FLT3-ITD mutant receptor (18Müller J.P. Schönherr C. Markova B. Bauer R. Stocking C. Böhmer F.D. Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Little is known about PTP, which negatively regulate FLT3. Loss of such PTP could potentially also contribute to transformation of AML cells. Initial studies demonstrated that co-expression of FLT3 with the PTP SHP-1, PTP1B, and PTP-PEST leads to FLT3 dephosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory function of these PTP for FLT3 signaling (14Schmidt-Arras D.E. Böhmer A. Markova B. Choudhary C. Serve H. Böhmer F.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3690-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the function of PTP in FLT3 signaling, we have analyzed a panel of relevant PTP by using shRNA-mediated down-regulation in myeloid 32D cells expressing wild type FLT3 as a model system. Stable down-regulation of the transmembrane PTP DEP-1/PTPRJ positively affected signaling of FLT3. In addition, we found that autophosphorylation of FLT3 as well as FL-stimulated cell proliferation were enhanced in response to DEP-1 depletion. Overexpression of DEP-1 inhibited FLT3 phosphorylation and signaling. Direct interaction studies using DEP-1 “trapping mutants” and dephosphorylation in vitro further supported that FLT3 is a bona fide substrate of DEP-1. Identification of DEP-1 as a negatively regulating PTP for FLT3 will enable analyzing a possible role in transformation of myeloid cells. The IL-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line 32D clone 3 (32D) (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ), Braunschweig, Germany) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate (5 mg/ml), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 1 ng/ml IL-3 or conditioned medium obtained from murine IL-3 producing BPV cells (20Heyworth C.M.

For expression of DEP-1, the sequence of human DEP-1 was cut out from pNRTIS33-DEP-1-WT (21Jandt E. Denner K. Kovalenko M. Ostman A. Böhmer F.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4175-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and inserted into the retroviral vector pMEX-IRES-puro (22Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T.

Constructs for expression of GST-DEP-1 (wild type or C1239S cytoplasmic domain) fusion proteins in E. coli were described earlier (23Petermann A. Haase D. Wetzel A. Balavenkatraman K.K. Tenev T. Gührs K.H. Friedrich S. Nakamura M. Mawrin C. Böhmer F.D. Brain Pathol. 2010; (December 27, 10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00464.x)PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in bacteria (strain Escherichia coli BL21) and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed by standard techniques. Constructs for transient expression of wild type DEP-1 or DEP-1 C1239S mutant were described previously (24Gross S. Knebel A. Tenev T. Neininger A. Gaestel M. Herrlich P. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26378-26386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An expression construct for the DEP-1 D1205A trapping mutant was kindly provided by Dr. Tencho Tenev (The Breakthrough Breast Cancer Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK). Dep-1 siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (5′-UACUGUGUCUUGGAAUCUAdGdC-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAGAUUCCAAGACACAGUAdGdG-3′ (antisense)) or control siRNA (target DNA sequence AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT; SI03650325) used in this study were obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). siRNA was transfected into THP-1 cells using AMAXA Nucleofector system, program version 01. 1.5 × 106 cells were transfected with 2.1 μg of siRNA using Nucleofector buffer V. For generation of retroviral particles, Phoenix amphotropic packaging cells (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were transiently transfected with the pMSCV-derivative plasmids using polyethyleneimine, and retrovirus-containing media were collected 48 h after transfection. 104 32D cells were infected three times with the pseudotyped particles in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (1,5-dimethyl-1,5-diazaundecamethylene polymethobromide, AL-118, catalog no. 10,768-9, Sigma). The transduction efficiency was in the range of 10–30% as assessed by parallel transduction with GFP-expressing viral particles. Selecting the population of the transduced cell pool with 2 μg/ml puromycin was started 48 h after transduction. Sufficiently propagated cell pools (5–10 × 106 cells) were subjected for phenotypic characterization immediately after establishment. In some cases, cells were sorted for equal FLT3 levels before analysis. Production of lentiviral particles and transduction of 32D cells with corresponding cell supernatants was carried out essentially following the above protocol, except that Phoenix gp cells were used for virus particle production by transfecting them with pLKO.1 derivative plasmids in combination with pRev, pEnv-VSV-G, and pMDLg (kindly provided by Dr. Carol Stocking, Hamburg, Germany) (25Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Beyer W.R. Westphal M. Ostertag W. von Laer D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Transduced cell pools were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. 104 32D cells were infected three times with the pseudotyped particles in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. The transduced cell pool was selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin or 400 μg/ml G418 48 h post-transduction and subjected to analysis. In some cases cells were sorted for equal FLT3 levels before analysis. Independent rounds for the knockdown of DEP-1 were performed and analyzed five times independently. In each round of transduction, the corresponding control shRNA cell pools were generated and analyzed in parallel. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding DEP-1 WT, DEP-1 C1239S, or DEP-1 D1205A along with a plasmid encoding human FLT3 in the molar ratio 1:1 using polyethyleneimine. 36 h after transfection, cells were starved for 8 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml FL for 5 min. Cells were then lysed, and immunoprecipitation of DEP-1 or FLT3 was carried out as described above. THP-1 cells were starved in cytokine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% FCS and stimulated with FL (100 ng/ml) for 2.5 min. Subsequently, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed. For FLT3 immunoprecipitation, lysis was done in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Immunoprecipitated FLT3 was incubated with the amounts of purified GST fusion proteins of wild type or catalytically inactive C1239S DEP-1 catalytic domain indicated in the figure in PTP assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT) at 30 °C for 30 min. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Dephosphorylation of FLT3 was analyzed by assessing the ratio of phosphorylated FLT3 (by using phosphotyrosine-specific antibody pTyr-Y100) to total FLT3 protein (detected by anti-FLT3 antibody C-20). To assess proliferation of the different 32D cell pools, cells were washed twice in IL-3-free medium, seeded in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS, and sodium pyruvate (5 mg/ml) in cytokine-free medium, or supplemented with FL or IL-3. For 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46262) Google Scholar), 20,000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated in specified growth conditions. MTT was added in the final concentration of 0.5 μg/μl. The formazan crystals were solubilized, and absorbance was measured at 570 nm. The assay was performed in triplicate. For GFP-based assays, 2 × 105 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (white plates with clear bottom). At the time points indicated in the figure legends, proliferation of quadruplicate samples was determined measuring GFP fluorescence intensity with a TECAN reader (Crailsheim, Germany). To analyze colony formation of 32D cell lines, 3 × 104 cells were plated in 1 ml of a culture mixture containing Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen), 1% methylcellulose, and 20% FCS per well of a 6-well plate. All samples were prepared in triplicate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for the indicated time periods before counting and photographing representative sections of the wells. Photographs were taken with a Zeiss AxioCam HRC digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted microscope. To obtain cell populations with a similar FLT3 protein level, cell pools were sorted for a similar GFP level using an ARIA FACS cell sorter (BD Biosciences). For detection of expression of human DEP-1, retrovirally transduced 32D cells were labeled with primary anti-DEP-1 antibody and subsequently co-stained with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Overexpression of DEP-1 was analyzed with a FACS Canto cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences). For isolation of 32D cells stably overexpressing huDEP-1, an ARIA FACS cell sorter was used. 32D cells were washed twice with PBS and starved in serum- and cytokine-free RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h before stimulation at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml FL or 1 ng/ml IL-3 for the time periods indicated. THP-1 cell were starved in cytokine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% FCS. Subsequently, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed. For FLT3 immunoprecipitation, lysis was done in 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. For detection of activated signaling proteins in cell lysates, RIPA buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA was used. Lysis buffers were freshly supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm glycerol phosphate), and lysis was allowed on ice for 15 min before thorough vortexing and centrifugation. FLT3 immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating with anti-FLT3 S-18 antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads. Adjusted aliquots of the cell extracts were subjected SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probing with the indicated primary antibodies. After subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the blots were developed using Western Lightning chemiluminescence detection (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and quantitatively evaluated using a CCD camera-based system (LAS3000, Fuji). For quantification of specific phosphorylation, blots for phosphorylated proteins were stripped and subsequently reprobed with pan-specific antibodies. Specific phosphorylation was calculated as the ratio of the signals for phosphorylated protein to the signal for total protein detected. Values of the nonstimulated samples of cells expressing the control shRNA cells were set to 1.0. A total of 106 cells were starved from cytokines and serum for 4 h, placed in 6-well plates, and exposed to 5 gray γ-irradiation. Immediately after irradiation, cells were supplemented with FL (50 ng/ml), IL-3 (1 ng/ml), or no cytokine with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Cell viability was analyzed using the annexin-V-PE apoptosis assay using flow cytometry. Cells staining negative for both annexin-V and 7-aminoactinomycin D were counted as viable cells. Eight- to 10-week-old male C3H/HeJ mice, which are syngeneic to 32Dcl3 cells, were used to assess the in vivo development of leukemia-like disease. 32D muFLT3 shDEP-1 A2/A3 cells (2 × 106) were injected into the lateral tail vein. The experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the local Committee on Animal Experimentation. To analyze the role of individual PTP on the activity of FLT3, we used 32D cells stably expressing FLT3 wild type protein (28Grundler R. Miething C. Thiede C. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2005; 105: 4792-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This murine bone marrow-derived cell line is strictly growth factor-dependent and therefore suitable to study receptor-mediated signaling and physiologic activity. A panel of 20 classical PTP was selected according to their known expression in 32D cells or generally in hematopoietic cells (29Mizuki M. Schwable J. Steur C. Choudhary C. Agrawal S. Sargin B. Steffen B. Matsumura I. Kanakura Y. Böhmer F.D. Müller-Tidow C. Berdel W.E. Serve H. Blood. 2003; 101: 3164-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or because of a presumed role in oncogenesis or tumor suppression (supplemental Table S1)(17Ostman A. Hellberg C. Böhmer F.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). shRNA expression cassettes were introduced in 32D FLT3 cells using the MISSION® shRNA lentivirus transduction system. Nonvalidated target sets of 4–5 shRNAs targeting each a particular PTP were packed into lentiviral pseudoparticles and transduced into 32D FLT3 cells. Transduced cell pools were selected by antibiotic treatment starting 2 days post-transduction and were subsequently expanded. Care was taken to ensure relatively high transduction efficiencies (10–30%) and to carry out analyses with cell pools that were only propagated for short periods to minimize clonal drifts. The effect of PTP knockdown on FLT3-mediated signaling quality was characterized by analyzing FL-mediated phosphorylation of ERK as a functional readout. Cells were starved in cytokine-free medium and subsequently stimulated with FL. Whole cell lysates of PTP-shRNA-expressing cells pools were immunoblotted with phospho-ERK antibodies, and its activation was scored. Although many shRNAs had little effect, several PTP-shRNAs caused altered ERK activation. These were subjected to a second validation screen, repeating shRNA transduction and ERK activation measurements with independently derived cell pools. For some positively scoring PTP in the second round, knockdown was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting (supplemental Table S1). Notably, two independent shRNAs targeting DEP-1 (further designated A2 and A3) reproducibly resulted in enhanced FLT3-mediated ERK phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S1). To validate the knockdown, protein and mRNA levels of DEP-1 were analyzed. As indicated in Fig. 1A, DEP-1 protein was reduced to 7 or 38% using shRNA targets A2 or A3, respectively, as compared with cells expressing a nontargeting control shRNA (or nontransduced cells, supplemental Fig. S2A). DEP-1 mRNA expression was similarly reduced to 9 or 38%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Depletion of CD45 in 32D FLT3 cells also enhanced FL-stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, indicating that this PTP may likewise interfere with FLT3 signaling (supplemental Table S1). A closer investigation of this finding revealed, however, that FLT3 surface expression was elevated in CD45-depleted cells by unknown mechanisms (data not shown). Therefore, the role of CD45 was not further investigated at this point. To analyze if DEP-1 depletion would lead to alterations in CD45 levels, the latter were checked in DEP-1-depleted cell pools. CD45 protein and mRNA levels were, however, unaffected by DEP-1 depletion (supplemental Fig. S2, A and C). We considered the possibility that PTP depletion would affect signaling of FLT3-ITD, the transforming mutant version of FLT3. shRNA-mediated down-regulation of DEP-1 did not, however, alter the autophosphorylation of FLT3-ITD nor the magnitude of constitutive or FL-stimulated FLT3-ITD signaling (data not shown). It is possible that FLT3-ITD"
https://openalex.org/W2036068677,"P2X7 receptors have emerged as potential drug targets for the treatment of medical conditions such as e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and neuropathic pain. To assess the impact of pharmaceuticals on P2X7, we screened a compound library comprising approved or clinically tested drugs and identified several compounds that augment the ATP-triggered P2X7 activity in a stably transfected HEK293 cell line. Of these, clemastine markedly sensitized Ca(2+) entry through P2X7 to lower ATP concentrations. Extracellularly but not intracellularly applied clemastine rapidly and reversibly augmented P2X7-mediated whole-cell currents evoked by non-saturating ATP concentrations. Clemastine also accelerated the ATP-induced pore formation and Yo-Pro-1 uptake, increased the fractional NMDG(+) permeability, and stabilized the open channel conformation of P2X7. Thus, clemastine is an extracellularly binding allosteric modulator of P2X7 that sensitizes P2X7 to lower ATP concentrations and facilitates its pore dilation. The activity of clemastine on native P2X7 receptors, Ca(2+) entry, and whole-cell currents was confirmed in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Similar effects were observed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Consistent with the data on recombinant P2X7, clemastine augmented the ATP-induced cation entry and Yo-Pro-1 uptake. In accordance with the observation that P2X7 controls the cytokine release from LPS-primed macrophages, we found that clemastine augmented the IL-1β release from LPS-primed human macrophages. Collectively, these data point to a sensitization of the recombinantly or natively expressed human P2X7 receptor toward its physiological activator, ATP, possibly leading to a modulation of macrophage-dependent immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1980377911,"The accumulation of unhealthy mitochondria results in mitochondrial dysfunction, which has been implicated in aging, cancer, and a variety of degenerative diseases. However, the mechanism by which mitochondrial quality is regulated remains unclear. Here, we show that Mieap, a novel p53-inducible protein, induces intramitochondrial lysosome-like organella that plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control. Mieap expression is directly regulated by p53 and is frequently lost in human cancer as result of DNA methylation. Mieap dramatically induces the accumulation of lysosomal proteins within mitochondria and mitochondrial acidic condition without destroying the mitochondrial structure (designated MALM, for Mieap-induced accumulation of lysosome-like organelles within mitochondria) in response to mitochondrial damage. MALM was not related to canonical autophagy. MALM is involved in the degradation of oxidized mitochondrial proteins, leading to increased ATP synthesis and decreased reactive oxygen species generation. These results suggest that Mieap induces intramitochondrial lysosome-like organella that plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control by eliminating oxidized mitochondrial proteins. Cancer cells might accumulate unhealthy mitochondria due to p53 mutations and/or Mieap methylation, representing a potential cause of the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W2052152807,"Antibodies to the water channel protein aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which is expressed in astrocytic endfeet at the blood brain barrier, have been identified in the serum of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) patients and are believed to induce damage to astrocytes. However, AQP4 specific T helper cell responses that are required for the generation of anti-AQP4 antibodies and most likely also for the formation of intraparenchymal CNS lesions have not been characterized.Using overlapping 15-meric peptides of AQP4, we identified the immunogenic T cell epitopes of AQP4 that are restricted to murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-A(b). The N-terminal region of AQP4 was highly immunogenic. More precisely, the intracellular epitope AQP4(22-36) was detected as major immunogenic determinant. AQP4(82-108) (located in the second transmembrane domain), AQP4(139-153) (located in the second extracellular loop), AQP4(211-225) (located in the fifth transmembrane domain), AQP4(235-249) (located in the sixth transmembrane domain), as well as AQP4(289-306) in the intracellular C-terminal region were also immunogenic epitopes. AQP4(22-36) and AQP4(289-303) specific T cells were present in the natural T cell repertoire of wild type C57BL/6 mice and T cell lines were raised. However, active immunization with these AQP4 peptides did not induce signs of spinal cord disease. Rather, sensitization with AQP4 peptides resulted in production of IFN-γ, but also IL-5 and IL-10 by antigen-specific T cells. Consistent with this cytokine profile, the AQP4 specific antibody response upon immunization with full length AQP4 included IgG1 and IgG2, which are associated with a mixed Th2/Th1 T cell response.AQP4 is able to induce an autoreactive T cell response. The identification of I-A(b) restricted AQP4 specific T cell epitopes will allow us to investigate how AQP4 specific autoimmune reactions are regulated and to establish faithful mouse models of NMO that include both cellular and humoral responses against AQP4."
https://openalex.org/W2146775979,"Identification of somatic mutations in cancer is a major goal for understanding and monitoring the events related to cancer initiation and progression. High resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis represents a fast, post-PCR high-throughput method for scanning somatic sequence alterations in target genes. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of HRM analysis for tumor mutation screening in a range of tumor samples, which included 216 frozen pediatric small rounded blue-cell tumors as well as 180 paraffin-embedded tumors from breast, endometrial and ovarian cancers (60 of each). HRM analysis was performed in exons of the following candidate genes known to harbor established commonly observed mutations: PIK3CA, ERBB2, KRAS, TP53, EGFR, BRAF, GATA3, and FGFR3. Bi-directional sequencing analysis was used to determine the accuracy of the HRM analysis. For the 39 mutations observed in frozen samples, the sensitivity and specificity of HRM analysis were 97% and 87%, respectively. There were 67 mutation/variants in the paraffin-embedded samples, and the sensitivity and specificity for the HRM analysis were 88% and 80%, respectively. Paraffin-embedded samples require higher quantity of purified DNA for high performance. In summary, HRM analysis is a promising moderate-throughput screening test for mutations among known candidate genomic regions. Although the overall accuracy appears to be better in frozen specimens, somatic alterations were detected in DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded samples."
https://openalex.org/W2136293604,"Background TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an immune effector molecule that functions as a selective anti-tumor agent. However, tumor cells, especially metastatic tumor cells often exhibit a TRAIL-resistant phenotype, which is currently a major impediment in TRAIL therapy. The aim of this study is to investigate the synergistic effect of TNFα and IFN-γ in sensitizing metastatic colon carcinoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings The efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of cooperation between TNFα and IFN-γ in sensitizing metastatic colon carcinoma cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were examined. The functional significance of TNFα- and IFN-γ-producing T lymphocyte immunotherapy in combination with TRAIL therapy in suppression of colon carcinoma metastasis was determined in an experimental metastasis mouse model. We observed that TNFα or IFN-γ alone exhibits minimal sensitization effects, but effectively sensitized metastatic colon carcinoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis when used in combination. TNFα and IFN-γ cooperate to repress Bcl-xL expression, whereas TNFα represses Survivin expression in the metastatic colon carcinoma cells. Silencing Bcl-xL expression significantly increased the metastatic colon carcinoma cell sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of Bcl-xL significantly decreased the tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, TNFα and IFN-γ also synergistically enhanced TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation. TNFα and IFN-γ was up-regulated in activated primary and tumor-specific T cells. TRAIL was expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells in vivo, and in tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) ex vivo. Consequently, TRAIL therapy in combination with TNFα/IFN-γ-producing CTL adoptive transfer immunotherapy effectively suppressed colon carcinoma metastasis in vivo. Conclusions/Significance TNFα and IFN-γ cooperate to overcome TRAIL resistance at least partially through enhancing caspase 8 activation and repressing Bcl-xL expression. Combined CTL immunotherapy and TRAIL therapy hold great promise for further development for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2049456898,"Macrophages can remove antigen from the surface of antibody-coated cells by a process termed trogocytosis. Using live cell microscopy and flow cytometry, we investigated the dynamics of trogocytosis by RAW264.7 macrophages of Ramos B cells opsonized with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. Spontaneous and reversible formation of uropods was observed on Ramos cells, and these showed a strong enrichment in rituximab binding. RAW-Ramos conjugate interfaces were highly enriched in rituximab, and transfer of rituximab to the RAW cells in submicron-sized puncta occurred shortly after cell contact. Membrane from the target cells was concomitantly transferred along with rituximab to a variable extent. We established a flow cytometry-based approach to follow the kinetics of transfer and internalization of rituximab. Disruption of actin polymerization nearly eliminated transfer, while blocking phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity only resulted in a delay in its acquisition. Inhibition of Src family kinase activity both slowed acquisition and reduced the extent of trogocytosis. The effects of inhibiting these kinases are likely due to their role in efficient formation of cell-cell conjugates. Selective pre-treatment of Ramos cells with phenylarsine oxide blocked uropod formation, reduced enrichment of rituximab at cell-cell interfaces, and reduced the efficiency of trogocytic transfer of rituximab. Our findings highlight that dynamic changes in target cell shape and surface distribution of antigen may significantly influence the progression and extent of trogocytosis. Understanding the mechanistic determinants of macrophage trogocytosis will be important for optimal design of antibody therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2075590391,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a heritable cancer syndrome characterized by tumors of the pituitary, pancreas and parathyroid. Menin, the product of the MEN1 gene, is a tumor suppressor protein that functions in part through the regulation of transcription mediated by interactions with chromatin modifying enzymes.Here we show menin association with the 5' regions of DNA damage response genes increases after DNA damage and is correlated with RNA polymerase II association but not with changes in histone methylation. Furthermore, we were able to detect significant levels of menin at the 3' regions of CDKN1A and GADD45A under conditions of enhanced transcription following DNA damage. We also demonstrate that menin is specifically phosphorylated at Ser394 in response to several forms of DNA damage, Ser487 is dynamically phosphorylated and Ser543 is constitutively phosphorylated. Phosphorylation at these sites however does not influence the ability to interact with histone methyltransferase activity. In contrast, the interaction between menin and RNA polymerase II is influenced by phosphorylation, whereby a phospho-deficient mutant had a higher affinity for the elongating form of RNA polymerase compared to wild type. Additionally, a subset of MEN1-associated missense point mutants, fail to undergo DNA damage dependent phosphorylation.Together, our findings suggest that the menin tumor suppressor protein undergoes DNA damage induced phosphorylation and participates in the DNA damage transcriptional response."
https://openalex.org/W2038064021,"Background Peri-implantitis has gained significant clinical attention in recent years. This disease is an inflammatory reaction to microorganisms around dental implants. Due to the limited accessibility, non-invasive antimicrobial strategies are of high interest. An unexpected approach to implant disinfection may evolve from electrolysis. Given the electrical conductivity of titanium implants, alkalinity or active oxidants can be generated in body fluids. We investigated the use of dental titanium implants as electrodes for the local generation of disinfectants. Our hypothesis was that electrolysis can reduce viable counts of adhering bacteria, and that this reduction should be greater if active oxidative species are generated. Methodology/Principal Findings As model systems, dental implants, covered with a mono-species biofilm of Escherichia coli C43, were placed in photographic gelatin prepared with physiological saline. Implants were treated by a continuous current of 0 - 10 mA for 15 minutes. The reduction of viable counts was investigated on cathodes and anodes. In separate experiments, the local change in pH was visualized using color indicators embedded in the gelatin. Oxidative species were qualitatively detected by potassium iodide-starch paper. The in situ generated alkaline environment around cathodic implants caused a reduction of up to 2 orders of magnitude in viable E. coli counts. On anodic implants, in contrast to cathodic counterparts, oxidative species were detected. Here, a current of merely 7.5 mA caused complete kill of the bacteria. Conclusions/Significance This laboratory study shows that electrochemical treatment may provide access to a new way to decontaminate dental implants in situ."

Here, we show that in addition to a typical H+-ATP synthase, Aphanothece halophytica contains a putative F1F0-type Na+-ATP synthase (ApNa+-ATPase) operon (ApNa+-atp). The operon consists of nine genes organized in the order of putative subunits β, ϵ, I, hypothetical protein, a, c, b, α, and γ. Homologous operons could also be found in some cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017. The ApNa+-atp operon was isolated from the A. halophytica genome and transferred into an Escherichia coli mutant DK8 (Δatp) deficient in ATP synthase. The inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli DK8 expressing ApNa+-ATPase exhibited Na+-dependent ATP hydrolysis activity, which was inhibited by monensin and tributyltin chloride, but not by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP). The Na+ ion protected the inhibition of ApNa+-ATPase by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The ATP synthesis activity was also observed using the Na+-loaded inverted membrane vesicles. Expression of the ApNa+-atp operon in the heterologous cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 showed its localization in the cytoplasmic membrane fractions and increased tolerance to salt stress. These results indicate that A. halophytica has additional Na+-dependent F1F0-ATPase in the cytoplasmic membrane playing a potential role in salt-stress tolerance.

These results indicate that A. halophytica has additional Na+-dependent F1F0-ATPase in the cytoplasmic membrane playing a potential role in salt-stress tolerance. The F1F0-type ATP synthase (ATPase) plays vital functions in the energy-transducing membranes of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts by catalyzing ATP synthesis and hydrolysis coupled with transmembrane proton or sodium ion transport (1von Ballmoos C. Wiedenmann A. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The hydrophilic extramembranous F1 domain consists of five different polypeptides with a stoichiometry of α3β3γδϵ. The integral membrane F0 domain consists of three different polypeptides (a, b, and c) and mediates the transfer of protons or sodium ions across the membrane. The number of c subunits shows substantial variation in different organisms (2Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18228-18235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Like F1F0-type ATPases, vacuolar V1V0- and archaea A1A0-type ATPases are also membrane-anchored rotary enzymes, although former functions primarily as an ATP-driven ion pump (1von Ballmoos C.

Plants are known to have two F-type ATPases, one each in the chloroplast and mitochondria, and one V-type ATPase residing in the vacuole. The cyanobacteria are oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and possess one F-type ATPase in the thylakoid membranes. All of these complexes use proton as the coupling ion (1von Ballmoos C. Wiedenmann A.

To date, two types of Na+-transporting mechanisms are known to extrude Na+ from the cytoplasm. The Na+/H+ antiporters are of one type that utilize energy of the transmembrane proton gradient for Na+ translocation (4Zhu J.K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar), whereas another type is the primary ATP-driven Na+-pumps in the plasma membrane (P-type Na+-ATPase) (5Shono M. Hara Y. Wada M. Fujii T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1996; 37: 385-388Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Balnokin Y.V. Popova L.G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The P-type Na+-ATPase is a single component polypeptide found in many organisms, including yeast. However, the presence of P-type Na+-ATPase in plants and algae seems to be rare. Aphanothece halophytica is a halotolerant cyanobacterium isolated from the Dead Sea. A. halophytica is known to accumulate betaine and can grow in a wide range of salinity (0.25–3.0 m NaCl) as well as at alkaline pH conditions (7Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36931-36938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that A. halophytica has a unique biosynthetic pathway of osmoprotectant betaine consisting of three-step methylation of glycine (8Waditee R. Tanaka Y. Aoki K. Hibino T.

From the shotgun sequencing of the whole genome, we found that A. halophytica contains a putative F1F0-type Na+-ATP synthase (ApNa+-ATPase) operon (ApNa+-atp). Isolation of the operon and its functional characterization are described below. A. halophytica cells were grown photoautotrophically in the BG11 liquid medium containing 18 mm NaNO3 and Turk Island salt solution at 30 °C (7Waditee R. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T.

Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 cells were also grown in the BG11 liquid medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES-KOH and bubbled with 3% CO2 at 30 °C under continuous fluorescent white light (40 μE m−2 s−1). Escherichia coli DH5α and DK8 (Δatp) (13Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The ApNa+-atp operon of A. halophytica was amplified by PCR using the primer set ApATPaseBamHI-F/ApATPaseSalI-R. The sequences of ApATPaseBamHI-F and ApATPaseSalI-R are 5′-GGATCCGGAGTTAGGGGCGATGGTACAAT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACGGATGAAGGATGATCACTC-3′, respectively. The amplified fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBSK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. The insert was then cloned in frame into the BamHI/SalI sites of pTrcHis2C (Invitrogen) with the C-terminal peptide of His6 tag. The resulting plasmid, pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp was introduced first to E. coli DH5α and then to DK8 cells (13Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the complementation test, E. coli DK8 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C or pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp were grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C. Cells were plated on to a 1.5% M13 minimal medium agar plate (pH 7.0), containing 42 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 8.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 15 μm thiamine, a carbon source (35 mm glucose or 35 mm succinate), and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. For growth experiments, the E. coli DK8 cells grown in LB medium at the late logarithmic phase were transferred into fresh medium containing various concentrations of NaCl at pH 7.0 with a starting A620 of 0.02. Cells were harvested at exponential growth phase and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 1.0 m sucrose. The collected cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 mm MgCl2) with a ratio (g ml−1) of 1.0:2.0. After homogenization, cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell at 400 kilopascals. Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 15 min. The inverted membrane vesicles were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, to a final protein concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The ATPase activity was assayed by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate resulting from the hydrolysis of ATP. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and membrane vesicles (30 μg of protein). The reaction was started by addition 4 mm ATP (Tris salt). Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 mm EDTA and 0.2 m NaCl. After incubation for 1 day, Na+-loaded membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended again in 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 0.25 m EDTA. ATP synthesis was measured in the reaction medium (0.5 ml) containing 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, 0.1 mm ADP, 1 μm valinomycin, and Na+-loaded-membrane vesicles (30 μg protein). At different time intervals, 50-μl sample was taken out and added immediately to 5 μl of 20% TCA. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquot (1 μl) of the supernatant was diluted with 99 μl of distilled water, and the ATP content was determined by luciferin/luciferase reaction. The pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp, which contains the trc promoter, was digested with ScaI and then ligated into the E. coli/Synechococcus shuttle vector pUC303 at the SalI-digested and blunt-ended site. The resulting plasmid, designated as pUC303-ApNa+-atp, was used to transform Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 cells (10Waditee R. Hibino T. Nakamura T. Incharoensakdi A. Takabe T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 4109-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For salt stress experiments, Synechococcus cells were subcultured in BG11 medium as described above but supplemented with 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin. Cells at the late logarithmic phase were transferred into fresh medium containing various concentrations of NaCl (0–0.5 m). The isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) was used to induce the ApNa+-atp expression under the trc promoter. Cells were harvested at exponential growth phase and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1.0 m sucrose. The collected cells were resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 5 mm MgCl2) with a ratio (g ml−1) of 1.0:2.0. After homogenization, the cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell at 400 kilopascals. Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 9800 × g for 15 min. The inverted membrane vesicles were sedimented by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, to a final protein concentration of 1 mg ml−1. The above prepared membrane vesicles (total membrane fraction) were used for the separation of thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugation at 110,000 × g for 16 h (14Berger S. Ellersiek U. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The gradient consisted of four layers: 5.5 ml of 58% sucrose, 4.5 ml of 40% sucrose, 4.5 ml of 30% sucrose, and 4 ml of 10% sucrose layer. Thylakoid membranes remained at the 40/58% sucrose interphase, whereas cytoplasmic membranes moved into the 30% sucrose layer that was essentially free of chlorophyll (14Berger S. Ellersiek U. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were determined using an ABI310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Cellular ions were determined with a Shimadzu PIA-1000 personal ion analyzer (9Wutipraditkul N. Waditee R. Incharoensakdi A. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Nakamura T. Shikata M. Takabe T. Takabe T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 4176-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford's method. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were carried out as described previously (15Waditee R. Bhuiyan N.H. Hirata E. Hibino T. Tanaka Y. Shikata M. Takabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34185-34193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antibody raised against the His6 tag was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Nucleotide sequence data of the ApNa+-atp operon from A. halophytica are deposited to the DDBJ database under the accession nos. AB602793, AB602794, and AB602795. From the shotgun sequence analysis of the A. halophytica genome, we found a putative F1F0-type ApNa+-atp operon in addition to the typical H+-ATPase (ApH+-ATPase) operon (ApH+-atp). The ApNa+-atp operon had nine ORFs, each with a putative start codon. These genes were organized in the order atpD (β), atpC (ϵ), atpI (I), hypothetical gene (hyp), atpB (a), atpE (c), atp F (b), atpA (α), and atp G (γ) (Fig. 1A). By contrast, gene organization of ApH+-atp splits into two clusters, encoding Iacbb′δαγ and βϵ (Fig. 1B). The gene organization of ApNa+-atp is similar to those of the atp operons in E. coli (EcH+-atp) (13Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) and Ilyobacter tartaricus (ItNa+-atp) (16Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar) that encode F-type H+- and Na+-ATPases, respectively. But, in EcH+-atp and ItNa+-atp, the operon starts from gene I and does not contain the hypothetical gene (Fig. 1, C and D). A Blast search revealed the presence of a similar operon in some cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, Acaryochloris marina MBIC11017, and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 (Fig. 1E). Among them, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 had the same gene organization to that of ApNa+-atp, whereas in A. marina MBIC11017 and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, additional gene(s) were found. The deduced protein sequences of the nine genes, except the gene encoding hypothetical protein, were compared with the corresponding sequences of ATPase subunits from different species. The protein encoded by ApNa+-atpI showed the least homologous (4–7% identity) compared with the corresponding subunit of H+-transporting ATPase from E. coli and Na+-transporting ATPase from I. tartaricus, Propionigenium modestum, Acetobacterium woodii, and Clostridium paradoxum. The α and β subunits of ApNa+-ATPase showed greater similarity to the corresponding subunits from other species (40–51% identity) than the remaining subunits, which showed ∼15–39% identity. Fig. 2 shows the phylogenetic tree of several ATPases. The β subunit of ApH+-ATPase exhibited high homology to the cyanobacterial H+-ATPases from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, A. marina MBIC11017, and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. It also exhibited high homology to that of spinach H+-ATPase, supporting the view that the plant chloroplast originated through endosymbiosis from a cyanobacterium. The β subunit of ApNa+-ATPase exhibited high homology to the Na+-ATPases from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, A. marina MBIC11017, and Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, but relatively low homology to subunit B of A-type ATPase from Methanosarcina mazei Go1 and V-type ATPase from Enterococcus hirae. This result suggests that cyanobacterial Na+-ATPases are F-type ATPase, and evolved earlier than the separation between cyanobacteria, E. coli, and I. tartaricus. The membrane-spanning helices of the multiple copies of subunit c in the F0 complex are the rotor ring of H+ (or Na+)-translocating ATP synthases (1von Ballmoos C. Wiedenmann A. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S1A shows the phylogenetic tree of subunit c in several ATPases. Subunit c of ApH+-ATPase exhibited high homology to that of cyanobacterial H+-ATPase and spinach H+-ATPase but was considerably different from that of ApNa+-ATPase, which is similar to the phylogenic tree of β subunit. Supplemental Fig. S1B shows the alignment of subunit c of several F-type ATPases. Based on x-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy studies, the binding sites for H+ and Na+ have been identified (1von Ballmoos C. Wiedenmann A. Dimroth P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 649-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 17Meier T. von Ballmoos C. Neumann S. Kaim G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The binding site of H+ in subunit c in spinach H+-ATPase has been assigned as Gln (Gln-34, numbering in subunit c of ApNa+-ATPase, Phe (Phe-65), Glu (Glu-67), Thr (Thr-70), and Tyr (Tyr-72), whereas the binding site of Na+ in subunit c of ItNa+-ATPase has been assigned as Gln (Gln-34), Val (Val-65), Glu (Glu-67), Ser (Ser-68), and Tyr (Tyr-72). The H+-binding site (Gln-34, Phe-65, Glu-67, Thr-70, and Tyr-72) was conserved in all cyanobacterial H+-translocating ATPases (supplemental Fig. S1B). For the Na+-binding site, Glu-67, Ser-68, and Tyr-72 were conserved in all cyanobacterial Na+-translocating ATPases. However, the Gln-34 changed to Glu (Glu-34) in all cyanobacterial Na+-ATPases. Val-65 did not change, but Glu-67, Ser-68, and Thr-69 motif were conserved. These results indicate that ApH+-ATPase presumably H+-translocating ATPases, although ion specificity of ApNa+-ATPase need to be tested experimentally. The plant F-type H+-ATPase has a unique regulatory mechanism, which is caused by a redox change of two cysteine residues located in the γ subunit. Under light, the reducing equivalents produced by photosynthetic electron transport reduce thioredoxin, which in turn reduces the disulfide bond formed within the γ subunit, yielding the active enzyme. The two cysteine residues forming the disulfide bond in the spinach H+-ATPase were assigned to Cys-199 and Cys-205 (18Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S2A shows the alignment of the γ subunit of several F-type ATPases. Cys-199 and Cys-205 of spinach H+-ATPase are shown in supplemental Fig. S2A in closed boxes. These cysteines were not conserved in all F-type ATPases from cyanobacteria, E. coli, and I. tartaricus. The spinach γ subunit is unique in having an extra domain around the two cysteine residues as shown by the dotted line box. In the cyanobacterial H+-ATPase, the extradomain was nine residues smaller and did not contain the two cysteine residues. By contrast, in the cyanobacterial Na+-ATPase, that type of extradomain was missing as is the case also in E. coli and I. tartaricus. The phylogenetic tree in supplemental Fig. S2B showed that the γ subunit of spinach H+-ATPase was separated from that of cyanobacterial H+-ATPase, indicating the evolution of unique regulating system in plant H+-ATP synthetases. To clone the ApNa+-atp operon from A. halophytica, PCR amplification was performed resulting in a 6832-bp PCR product in which the GTG start codon in atpD was changed to ATG. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV restriction site of pBSK+ vector and sequenced. Although one nucleotide change from GAG (Glu-41) to GAT (Asp-41) was found in the β subunit, this clone was used for further experiments because the substitution is rather conserved. Then, the insert was digested with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into the BamHI/SalI sites of pTrcHis2C expression vector. The last gene, atpG, was fused in frame with His6 tag. To examine the functional properties of ApNa+-atp, these genes were expressed in the E. coli mutant DK8 lacking the unc operon encoding ATPase (Δatp). As shown in Fig. 3A, the γ subunit of ApNa+-ATPase could be detected in the E. coli DK8 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp but not with the vector alone. The expression was maximum at 2–5 h, and therefore, the 3-h induction time point was employed hereafter, unless otherwise stated. The expression level of γ subunit increased with increase in NaCl concentrations (Fig. 3B). To examine the localization of γ subunit in DK8, E. coli cells expressing ApNa+-atp were fractionated into the cytoplasmic, periplasmic, and membrane fractions, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses. The γ subunit was detected in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the γ subunit and whole complex are assembled into the cytoplasmic membranes of E. coli cells. As a next step, the E. coli membrane fraction was solubilized with Triton X-100, fractionated by 40–65% (g/v) ammonium sulfate, and applied to an ion exchange column chromatography. The active fractions were then used for activity measurements. We next examined whether the expressed ApNa+-ATPase has ATP hydrolysis activity. The ATP hydrolysis activity in the inverted membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells increased with increasing NaCl concentrations (Fig. 4A). The apparent Km value for Na+ was determined as 3.0 mm. The ATP hydrolysis activity of control cells (the empty vector transformants) was very low and did not increase upon the increase of NaCl concentration (data not shown). The ATP hydrolysis activity of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells increased with increasing ATP (Fig. 4B); the apparent Km value for ATP was determined to be 2.8 mm. The Na+ content inside the ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells decreased when cells were transferred to a new Na+-free medium, but no change in the Na+ content was observed inside the control cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the E. coli DK8 cells expressing ApNa+-ATPase can extrude Na+ from inside the cells to the external medium. The ATP hydrolysis activity in inverted membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells was strongly inhibited by azide (F1 inhibitor; 55%), DCCD 2The abbreviations used are: DCCD, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone. (F0 inhibitor; 70%), tributyltin chloride (F0 inhibitor; 80%), and monensin (Na+-gradient dissipator; 70%), but not by CCCP (a protonophore) and KNO3 (a permeant anion) (Fig. 5A). Moreover, Na+ provided protection against inhibition by DCCD. When NaCl was added into the individual reaction medium, the DCCD-inhibited ATPase activity was decreased to 70, 40, and 30% in the presence of 1, 10, and 50 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 5B). To know whether the expressed ApNa+-ATPase in DK8 cells has ATP synthesis activity, the ATP synthesis activity was assayed using the luciferin/luciferase reaction. The Na+-loaded inverted membrane vesicles of E. coli DK8 cells were prepared and incubated with the reaction medium (0.5 ml) containing 5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, and 0.1 mm ADP. The ATP synthesis was observed in the membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells (Fig. 6A, closed circles), but not in the empty vector transformants (data not shown). To examine the requirement of Δψ on ATP synthesis, inhibitors and ionophores were added to the reaction medium. Results showed that membrane potential-generating K+/valinomycin and protonophore CCCP stimulated ATP synthesis (Fig. 6A), implying that ATP synthesis requires Δψ but not ΔpH. In contrast, the Na+ gradient dissipator monensin and the F0 inhibitor DCCD inhibited ATP synthesis, suggesting that ATP synthesis by F1F0-ATPase requires ΔpNa+. Furthermore, application of external Na+ (20 and 50 mm NaCl) into the reaction medium decreased the ATP synthesis (Fig. 6B). In other words, decrease in ΔpNa+ due to external Na+ causes decrease in the ATP synthesis. We next investigated the physiological role of ApNa+-ATPase, namely the NaCl-stress tolerance in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 7, E. coli DK8 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C or pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp exhibited similar growth patterns in the absence of NaCl. An increase in the NaCl concentration up to 0.2 and 0.5 m NaCl resulted in slow growth of all cells. However, the growth rate of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells was higher than that of empty vector transformants. Therefore, the effect of NaCl on growth of a salt-sensitive mutant E. coli TO114, in which nhaA, nhaB, and chaA genes were deleted, was determined. The E. coli TO114 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C-ApNa+-atp grew in the growth medium containing 0.2 m NaCl, whereas the E. coli TO114 cells transformed with pTrcHis2C did not (data not shown). To determine whether ApNa+-atp could complement E. coli DK8 (Δatp), empty vector transformant and ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells were plated onto M13 minimal medium containing succinate as the sole carbon and energy source. Control plates contained glucose in the same amount as succinate. Results showed that empty vector transformants could grow only on glucose, whereas ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells could grow on both glucose and succinate (data not shown). Hence, the ApNa+-atp operon encoding F1F0-ATPase was able to produce ATPase in the host cells, supporting the growth of E. coli DK8 on a nonfermentable carbon source. The expression plasmid pUC303-ApNa+-atp containing isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible trc promoter was introduced into Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 cells. The expression of γ subunit of ApNa+-ATPase was detected in the membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells (Fig. 8A). Its expression level increased with the increase of NaCl in the growth medium (Fig. 8B). To examine the localization of ApNa+-ATPase, total membrane fractions were applied on the sucrose density gradient as described in “Experimental Procedures” (14Berger S. Ellersiek U. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes contained ∼4.1 μg chlorophyll per mg protein, whereas cytoplasmic membranes were essentially free of chlorophyll (data not shown). Moreover, data presented in Fig. 8C revealed that a single protein band of the corresponding molecular mass of γ subunit of ApNa+-ATPase was found in plasma membrane fraction, which was identified by the presence of the nitrate transporter NrtA (19Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This indicated that ApNa+-ATPase was localized in the plasma membrane of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells. It was shown that all of the transformants could grow at almost the same rate in the BG11 medium (Fig. 9A). At 0.3 m NaCl concentration, the growth rate of both empty vector transformants and ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells decreased but the growth rate of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells is higher than the growth rate of empty vector transformants (Fig. 9B). At 0.5 m NaCl concentration, empty vector transformants could not grow, whereas ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells could (Fig. 9C), indicating that the ApNa+-atp transformation impaired growth at high salinity. The sequence of ApNa+-atp operon was obtained from the shotgun genome sequencing of A. halophytica. Nine ORFs were organized in the order atpD (β), atpC (ϵ), atpI (I), hypothetical gene (hyp), atpB (a), atpE (c), atpF (b), atpA (α), and atpG (γ) (Fig. 1), which is different from other bacteria. In C. paradoxum, E. coli, I. tartaricus, and P. modestum, the atp operon consists of nine structural genes, atpI (I), atpB (a), atpE (c), atpF (b), atpH (δ), atpA (α), atpG (γ), atpD (β), and atpC (ϵ), which are grouped together to form a single transcriptional unit (16Walker J.E.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The atp operon in a strictly anaerobic A. woodii consists of 11 genes, including nine genes found in the bacterial atp operons and additional two copies of atpE (c) (22Rahlfs S. Aufurth S. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33999-34004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, the structural genes in cyanobacteria Anabaena strain PCC 7210, Synechococcus strain PCC 6301, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are organized in two separate domains, with one containing atpB (a), atpE (c), atpF (b), atpH (δ), atpA (α), and atpG (γ), whereas the other contained atpD (β) and atpC (ϵ) (23Curtis S.E. J.

Biol. 1991; 17: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although the deduced protein sequences of nine ApNa+-ATPase subunits showed low percent identity compared with the corresponding sequences of F-type ATPase subunits from different species, the conserved amino acids Ser68 and Thr69 at the Na+-binding site of the ApNa+-ATPase subunit c were found (supplemental Fig. S1). The Na+-binding site of the I. tartaricus ATPase and H+-binding site of the spinach chloroplast ATPase subunit c were compared (2Vollmar M. Schlieper D. Winn M. Büchner C. Groth G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 18228-18235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Alanine was present at position 62 of the H+-translocating ATPase, whereas a polar serine or threonine was observed in the equivalent position of Na+-translocating ATPase. Likewise, the hydrophobic side chain leucine was found in H+-translocating ATPase at position 63, but threonine was found at the equivalent position of Na+-translocating ATPase. The data presented above clearly indicate that F-typeNa+-ATPase from A. halophytica is a Na+-translocating ATPase. Furthermore, this study examined the biochemical properties and physiological functions of ApNa+-ATPase. The expression of ApNa+-ATPase in ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells could impair its growth under high salinity (Fig. 7). The ATP hydolysis activity in inverted membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 was dependent on NaCl and ATP concentration in the reaction medium (Fig. 4). Moreover, the Na+ extrusion from Na+-loaded ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells was observed after the cells were energized with glucose (data not shown), suggesting that the Na+ extrusion is likely due to the contribution by ApNa+-ATPase because glucose can yield ATP during its metabolism. ApNa+-ATPase was confirmed as a member of F-type Na+-ATPase by using appropriate inhibitors. The ATPase activity was inhibited by azide (F1 inhibitor), DCCD (F0 inhibitor), or tributyltin chloride (F0 inhibitor). In addition, it was found that monensin (Na+-gradient dissipator) inhibited ATPase activity, whereas CCCP (a protonophore) and KNO3 (a permeant anion) did not inhibit activity (Fig. 5A). These data indicate the involvement of ΔpNa+ but not ΔpH on ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, it was found that Na+ could protect ATPase activity from DCCD inhibition in a pH-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). Using another approach, ATP synthesis was observed in the Na+-loaded membrane vesicles of ApNa+-ATPase-expressing E. coli DK8 cells in the presence of ΔpNa+ and Δψ (Fig. 6). Our data revealed that ATP synthesis was stimulated in the presence of K+/valinomycin. ATP synthesis decreased when external Na+ and monensin (Na+ gradient dissipator) were added because both of them reduced ΔpNa+ (Fig. 6B). Based on these results, it can be concluded that ATP synthesis catalyzed by ApNa+-ATPase requires ΔpNa+. As per the above data, we thought that the introduction of ApNa+-atp operon into the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 will confer salt tolerance to this organism. As expected, the ApNa+-ATPase-expressing cells could grow in the BG11 medium containing 0.5 m NaCl, whereas the empty vector transformants could not (Fig. 9). From these results, ApNa+-atp transformation could improve salt tolerance in the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 as well as E. coli DK8 mutant (Δatp) and salt-sensitive mutant E. coli TO114. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression level of γ subunit of ApNa+-ATPase increased with increasing NaCl concentration in the growth medium (Fig. 8B). Taken together, our results strongly suggest a role for ApNa+-ATPase in the salt-stress tolerance of this photosynthetic organism. We thank Professor T.

https://openalex.org/W2100900404,"Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase (VHR) is classified as a dual specificity phosphatase. Unlike typical dual specificity phosphatases, VHR lacks the MAPK-binding domain and shows poor activity against MAPKs. We found that EGF receptor (EGFR) was a direct substrate of VHR and that overexpression of VHR down-regulated EGFR phosphorylation, particularly at Tyr-992 residue. Expression of VHR inhibited the activation of phospholipase Cγ and protein kinase C, both downstream effectors of Tyr-992 phosphorylation of EGFR. Decreasing VHR expression by RNA interference caused higher EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-992. In addition to EGFR, VHR also directly dephosphorylated ErbB2. Consistent with these results, suppression of VHR augmented the foci formation ability of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, whereas overexpression of VHR suppressed cell growth in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. Expression of VHR also suppressed tumor formation in a mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, VHR expression was significantly lower in NSCLC tissues in comparison to that in normal lung tissues. Collectively, this study shows that down-regulation of VHR expression enhances the signaling of ErbB receptors and may be involved in NSCLC pathogenesis.

Among protein modifications, tyrosine phosphorylation is extensively used only in multicellular, eukaryotic organisms. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in signaling transduction pathways that are involved in embryogenesis, development, and homeostasis. Disorders in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation are found in many human diseases from cancer to immune disorders. Although protein phosphorylation is a balanced action of protein kinases and phosphatases, the experimental data of protein phosphatases is proportionally much less than that of protein kinases. Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) 3The abbreviations used are: DUSP, dual specificity phosphatase; EGFR, EGF receptor; MKP, MAPK phosphatase; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PLC, phospholipase C; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; TR, Tet repressor; VHR, vaccinia H1-related phosphatase. are structurally related to protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) and are initially implicated in the down-regulation of MAPKs (1Alonso A.

The induction of MKP expression by MAPK signaling may, in turn, lead to the down-regulation of MAPK activities. Recently, many newly identified DUSPs were found to have little or no phosphatase activity against MAPKs, indicating that MAPK inactivation is not the sole function of DUSPs (18Chen A.J. Zhou G.

VHR, a phosphatase related to the vaccinia virus phosphatase VH1, is among the first identified mammalian DUSPs (1Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A.

Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, conclusive evidence supporting its role in dephosphorylating growth factor receptors in a biological context is absent. VHR has been shown to inactivate JNK and ERK pathways in different systems (25Todd J.L. Rigas J.D. Rafty L.A. Denu J.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2573-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, its suppressive activity against MAPKs is weak in comparison to that of MKPs. Moreover, unlike MKPs, VHR expression is not up-regulated in response to MAPK activation (27Alonso A. Saxena M. Williams S. Mustellin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). VHR is phosphorylated by ZAP70 at tyrosine residue 138 in response to T cell receptor signaling. This phosphorylation augments VHR activity in suppressing the ERK pathway (27Alonso A. Saxena M. Williams S. Mustellin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). A recent report shows that expression levels of VHR are regulated during the cell cycle. Knockdown of VHR expression by RNA interference causes cell cycle arrest and senescence (28Rahmouni S. Cerignoli F. Alonso A. Tsutji T. Henkens R. Zhu C. Louis-dit-Sully C. Moutschen M. Jiang W. Mustelin T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 524-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The aim of this research was to further examine the biological function of VHR in epithelial cells. Our results showed that VHR had very limited activity against MAPKs and that VHR regulated receptor-proximal signaling through dephosphorylating ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases. Our data from cultured cells, transplanted tumors, and clinical patient samples suggested that a decrease in VHR expression could be involved in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer. All of the H1299-derived cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin. H1299 cells were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For establishing the tetracycline-inducible cells, a pcDNA6/TR vector (Invitrogen), which encodes the Tet repressor (TR), was transfected into H1299 cells. The transfected cells were selected by blasticidin (40 μg/ml) for 1 week to form the H1299TR cells. The pcDNA4/TO-Myc-VHR (or MKP-1) vector was transfected into H1299TR cells. The transfected cells were selected by Zeocin (500 μg/ml) for 1 week to generate H1299-VHRTR (or MKP-1TR) cells. To construct the human VHR expression vectors, DNA fragment encoding the VHR gene was PCR-amplified using a cDNA clone (GenBankTM number BM926103, American Type Culture Collection) as a template, 5′-GCGGGATCCACCATGTCGGGCTCGTTCGAG as the forward primer, and 5′-GTGCTCGAGATGGGTTTCAACTTCCCCTC as the reverse primer. The DNA fragment was enzyme-digested and inserted into pcDNA4/TO/Myc-His B (Invitrogen) and pGEX-GST-4T-3 (GE Healthcare) vectors between the BamHI and XhoI sites to form the Myc-VHR and GST-VHR expression vectors, respectively. The VHR-C124S phosphatase-inactive mutant (VHR-CS) constructs were generated by the side-directed mutagenesis method and sequence-verified. Mammalian and bacterial expression vector of MKP-1 were described previously (21Wang J.Y. Lin C.H. Yang C.H. Tan T.H. Chen Y.R. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The RNA interference vector against human VHR was generated using the pSuper-retro vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) as a backbone. A 19-nucleotide sequence (5′-CCTCAGCGCTTACTTTGAA) corresponding to the nucleotides 291–309 of human VHR coding sequence was used for designing the inverted repeat insertion in pSuper-retro vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA interference-resistant VHR vector was constructed by generating T300G, C303T, T306C, and A309G mutations within the coding sequence in a FLAG-VHR plasmid using the side-directed mutagenesis method. Protein A beads and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) were purchased from Sigma. The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was prepared from the culture of a hybridoma (clone 9E10). Anti-VHR, JNK, pJNK, pp38-MAPK, pERK, and anti-Tyr(P) (p-Tyr-100) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-ERK antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). The anti-GST (SC-138) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). The peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were purchased from Peirce. EGF and puromycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TNF-α was purchased from R & D System (Minneapolis, MN). Zeocin and blasticidin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fresh frozen tumor and paired nontumor lung tissue specimens from NSCLC patients receiving surgical resection at Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital were obtained from the tissue bank of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital with signed informed consent. All of the specimens were snap frozen soon after resection and stored at −80 °C. The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital and National Health Research Institutes. Before RNA extraction, one frozen section stained by hematoxylin and eosin stain was performed first for the histopathology examination by a pathologist (SF Huang). In this way, the tumor diagnosis and tumor percentage were determined. The benign paired lung tissue was also examined to make sure there was no tumor contamination. The RNA extraction was performed with SV total RNA isolation system (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Reverse transcription of cDNAs were performed using the ProtoScript first strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and using 1 μg of total RNA as templates. The reverse transcription mixtures were used as templates in subsequent PCRs or were stored at −20 °C. Quantification of mRNA was conducted by real time PCR on the LightCycler instrument (Roche Applied Science). Specificity was further verified by checking the PCR products using agarose gel electrophoresis. Real time PCR was performed using a kit of LightCycler FastStart DNA Masterplus SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 20 μl in the LightCycler glass capillaries. The reaction program was: initial heating to 95 °C for 10 min followed by 45 PCR cycles of heating to 95 °C for 10 s, incubation for 10 s at the annealing temperature specific for the use of primer, and incubation for 25 s at 72 °C. We conducted a melting curve analysis after every real time PCR to identify PCR product and to detect the possible presence of contaminating products. We also quantified transcripts of β-Actin gene, and each sample was normalized on the basis of its β-actin mRNA content. The relative quantification was determined by using a comparative threshold cycle (CT) method. Immunohistochemical staining was performed at the Pathology Core Laboratory, National Health Research Institutes. The assays were performed on 4-μm-thick formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The sections were deparaffinized twice in xylene for 10 min and twice in ethanol for 2 min and then placed in 10 mm citric buffer solution (pH 6.0) and heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The samples were washed once with PBS, and the endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 3% H2O2 for 5 min. The slides were rinsed twice with PBS and then incubated with a VHR antibody (number AP8478a; Abgent, San Diego, CA) at 1:50 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with an anti-rabbit antibody-conjugated with peroxidase (1:500; Santa Cruz) for 1 h. The slides were then washed with PBS three times and incubated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen for 10 min. After the reaction, the slides were washed with water three times and counterstained with hematoxylin. Whole cell lysate was prepared by suspending 2 × 106 cells in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The cell extracts were kept on ice and vigorously mixed four times at 5-min intervals. The extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected for further analyses or stored at −80 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described with modifications (29Chen Y.R. Han J. Kori R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39334-39342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Target proteins in cell extracts were precipitated by incubation with a specific antibody plus protein A/G-agarose beads in 1 ml of lysis buffer with continuously rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, and 10 mm DTT). The immunocomplex was then mixed with 50 μl of phosphatase reaction buffer containing indicated amounts of GST-VHR or GST-MKP-1. The phosphatase reaction was performed at 37 °C for indicated times and then terminated by adding SDS sampling buffer. The reaction mixtures were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE plus Western blot analyses. Immunoprecipitated proteins or 50–100 μg of cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–10%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL). The membrane was first incubated in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% of nonfat milk powder (or 2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h, then incubated with a primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed twice (10 min each) with TBST buffer, and blotted with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed four times (10 min each) with TBST buffer, subjected to chemiluminescence reaction in the SuperSignal reagent (Pierce), and exposed to x-ray films. H1299-VHRTR (or H1299-pSuper and VHRi) cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes (100 cells/dish) and cultured with or without tetracycline (5 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. The cells were fixed and stained by the Giemsa staining method. The numbers of cell foci (bigger than 1 mm in diameter) were determined. The data are presented as the percentages of foci numbers of untreated H1299-VHRTR and that of H1299-pSuper control cells. Three-dimensional culture system was consisted of three layers. In 24-well plate, each well was firstly coated with 300 μl, 0.4% agarose in RPMI medium plus 10% serum. The second layer contained growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences; Bedford, MA) and H1299-VHRTR cells. One thousand cells were suspended in 320 μl of medium, and then the cell-containing medium was mixed with 160 μl of Matrigel. After seeding the total 480-μl mixture on the first gel layer, the gel culture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to solidify. Finally 300 μl of culture medium with or without tetracycline was added on the solidified Matrigel. The final concentration of tetracycline in the whole culture system was 5 μg/ml. Eight-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were purchased from BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd. The animals had access to food and water ad libitum. The experimental procedures using animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Health Research Institutes. The mice were injected subcutaneously with H1299-VHRTR cells. Each injection contained 2 × 106 cells suspended in 150 μl of RPMI 1640 medium with 30% of growth factor-reduced Matrigel. Five days post-injection, the mice were provided with water containing 0 or 1 mg/ml of tetracycline (supplemented with 10 mg/ml sucrose for palatability). Four weeks post-injection, the tumors were harvested, weighted, and processed for immunohistochemistry or Western blot analyses. We established an inducible expression system for VHR in H1299 NSCLC cells. The expression of Myc-tagged VHR was induced by tetracycline to a level that was similar to endogenous VHR (Fig. 1A, endo VHR). Interestingly, the induction of Myc-VHR expression in H1299 cells did not decrease JNK activation by TNF-α. In contrast, expression of Myc-MKP-1, to a much lower level than that of Myc-VHR, apparently suppressed JNK activation by TNF-α (Fig. 1B). Additionally, expression of VHR did not affect ERK activation by EGF and p38-MAPK activation by TNF-α (Fig. 1, C and D). Because our result differed from the previous reports showing that JNK was negatively regulated by VHR, we examined whether VHR could directly dephosphorylate JNK1 in vitro. We tested recombinant GST-VHR and GST-MKP-1 against JNK1 to have an equivalent comparison of these two DUSPs. Phosphorylated JNK1 was subjected to reactions with various amounts of GST phosphatases. We found that JNK1 could be efficiently dephosphorylated even by the lowest amount of GST-MKP-1. In contrast, GST-VHR failed to dephosphorylate JNK1 in the same reaction condition (Fig. 2A). This result, consistent with the data in Fig. 1, indicated that VHR was not an effective JNK phosphatase in comparison to MPK-1. Taken together, our data suggested that VHR was not a major cellular MAPK phosphatase. VHR is more effective in dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine residue than phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (30Schumacher M.A. Todd J.L. Rice A.E. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Actually, the first report on VHR shows that VHR dephosphorylates multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including EGFR, FGFR, and insulin receptor in vitro (24Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, the regulatory role of VHR on receptor signaling has not been characterized in a biological system. We hypothesized that, instead of being a dual specific MAPK phosphatase, VHR might serve as a PTP in mammalian cells. Because of the availability of various phospho motif-specific antibodies against EGFR, we selected EGFR as a candidate molecule for further examination. Immunoprecipitated EGFR was subjected to in vitro reactions with wild type or phosphatase-inactive GST-VHR; the reaction mixtures were analyzed by Western blotting using various phospho-EGFR antibodies. Incubation with wild type VHR, but not its mutant, apparently decreased EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr-845, Tyr-992, and Tyr-1068. The effect was weaker at Tyr-1045 and Tyr-1173 (Fig. 2B). These data supported the notion that VHR is an EGFR phosphatase. Interestingly, when we examined the EGFR phosphorylation pattern in H1299-VHRTR/EGFR in the presence of VHR induction, we detect a clear decrease of phosphorylation at only Tyr-992 but less so at other Tyr residues (Fig. 3A). Induction of VHR expression in H1299-VHRTR/EGFR cells also decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins in response to EGF stimulation (Fig. 3B). This result indicated that VHR did regulate EGFR signaling in a biological context. Similar experiments were performed to test whether VHR dephosphorylated ErbB2. We found that VHR decreased ErbB2 phosphorylation in vitro and in a cellular context, and the dephosphorylation of ErbB2 was more evident at Tyr-877 and Tyr-1221 than those at Tyr-1139 and Tyr-1248 (supplemental Fig. S1). Our data indicated that VHR was a cellular PTP against EGFR and ErbB2. Because we did not detect significant endogenous ErbB2 expression in most of the NSCLC cell lines tested (data not shown), we focused our study on the effect of VHR against endogenous EGFR. We treated H1299-VHRTR cells with EGF for various times (5–60 min) in the presence or absence of VHR induction. We found that VHR expression suppressed endogenous EGFR Tyr-992 phosphorylation but mainly at the early time points of EGF treatment (0, 5, 10, and 20 min). VHR expression had minimal effects at later time points (30 and 60 min) (Fig. 4A). This result was reproducible and more evident in H1299-VHRTR/EGFR cells (Fig. 4B). The expression level of EGFR in H1299-VHRTR/EGFR was ∼2.5-fold of that in control H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S2A). These data suggested that VHR suppressed the early phase of Tyr-992 phosphorylation during EGFR activation. Interestingly, when we examined the interaction between EGFR and VHR by co-immunoprecipitation, we found that VHR-EGFR interaction was weak but detectable in the absence of ligand stimulation. However, this interaction was decreased upon EGF stimulation (supplemental Fig. S2B). Ligand-induced dissociation between VHR and EGFR could explain the ineffectiveness of VHR on EGFR Tyr-992 phosphorylation at the later time points upon EGF stimulation. To test whether EGFR signaling regulated the expression of VHR, we treated parental H1299 cells with EGF and collected cell samples at various time points for examining the VHR expression levels. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2C, VHR expression remained constant through 0–8 h post-EGF stimulation, indicating that VHR was not regulated by EGFR signaling. To validate the role of endogenous VHR in EGFR signaling, we established VHR-deficient H1299 cells (H1299-VHRi) using the RNA interference method. VHR expression in H1299-VHRi cells was ∼33% (an average of multiple samples) of that in control H1299-pSuper cells. In comparison to H1299-pSuper cells, H1299-VHRi cells showed a stronger phosphorylation at EGFR Tyr-992 residue (Fig. 4C) with or without EGFR stimulation. When VHR was reintroduced into H1299-VHRi cells through a RNA interference-resistant vector (H1299-VHRi/VHR), phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr-992 was reduced and less responsive to EGF (Fig. 4C). This result, consistent with the previous data, showed that VHR regulated EGFR signaling through suppressing Tyr-992 phosphorylation. Tyr-992 phosphorylation of EGFR has been shown to be involved in the recruitment of PLCγ and Src. To test whether decreasing the early EGFR Tyr-992 phosphorylation by VHR was sufficient to affect downstream signaling, we examined the regulatory effects of VHR on the PLCγ-PKC pathway. We found that expression of VHR in H1299-VHRTR cells decreased both basal and EGF-induced Tyr-783 phosphorylation in PLCγ, suggesting that VHR did suppress PLCγ signaling (Fig. 5A). To further support this observation, we found that EGF-induced PKC activation, a downstream event of PLCγ signaling, was also suppressed in the H1299-VHRTR cell with VHR induction (Fig. 5B). These data indicated that VHR not only suppressed EGFR Tyr-992 phosphorylation, it also inhibited the downstream signaling events. However, when we examined Src activation by detecting phosphorylation on the activating residue Tyr-416, we found that expression of VHR did not affect Src activation by EGF stimulation (supplemental Fig. S3A). Consistent with this result, VHR also did not affect the activation status of Src when both molecules were co-expressed in H1299 cells (supplemental Fig. S3B). These data indicated that VHR had a minimal effect in regulating Src activation. Both EGFR and ErbB2 are involved in the regulation of epithelial cell growth. Because of the suppressive effect of VHR on EGFR and ErbB2 signaling, we tested whether expression of VHR affected cell growth in H1299 cells. In regular, monolayer cell culture, we did not observe a significant difference between H1299-VHRTR cells with or without VHR induction (data not shown). However, when H1299-VHRTR cells were seeded at a low density (100 cells/60-mm dish) and allowed to grow for 2 weeks, induction of VHR significantly suppressed cell foci formation (Fig. 6A). Consistent with this observation, suppression of VHR expression by RNA interference enhanced foci formation in H1299 cells (Fig. 6A). We also tested the growth-suppressive effect of VHR when cells were maintained in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures. In the absence of VHR induction, H1299-VHRTR cells formed colonies of significant size in 2 weeks. In the presence of tetracycline and VHR expression, the colonies formed by H1299-VHRTR cells were much less and smaller (Fig. 6B). Taken together, our data indicated that VHR expression in H1299 cells could suppress cell proliferation in both two- and three-dimensional cultures. We also performed tumor xenograft experiments by injecting the H1299-VHRTR cells into nude mice subcutaneously. The mice were provided with water containing 0 or 1 mg/ml of tetracycline. Four weeks post-injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were harvested, weighed, and examined for VHR expression. The tumors formed in mice treated with tetracycline were significantly smaller than those formed in control mice (Fig. 6, C and D). The relative levels of endogenous and tet-induced Myc-VHR in the tumors were similar to that of cells cultured in vitro (Fig. 6E). This result was consistent with the notion that VHR suppressed cancer cell growth. Our data strongly suggested that VHR played an important role in controlling cell proliferation, which is usually increased in cancer tissues. We hypothesized that expression of VHR might be down-regulated in cancer tissues. To test this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA expression of VHR and a closely related DUSP, MKP-6, in 36 pairs of cancer/adjacent normal tissues from NSCLC patients. We found that VHR expression was significantly lower in tumor tissues in comparison to adjacent normal lung tissues (Fig. 7). The selected sample size of 36 will yield 96.4% power for detecting a clinically meaningful difference of 0.33 between the two groups (normal versus tumor) at the 5.0% level of significance. This difference was more evident in lung adenocarcinoma than in squamous cell carcinoma (supplemental Fig. S4A) and was more significant in advanced stage III cancers than in stage I cancers (supplemental Fig. S4B). In contrast to VHR, MKP-6 expression was not significantly changed in NSCLC tissues (Fig. 7). To support the data of mRNA analyses, we performed immunohistochemical assays on tissue sections from patients with more than a 3-fold difference in VHR expression between tumor and normal tissues. As shown in supplemental Fig. S5, those tumor tissues showed weaker VHR staining intensity than the adjacent normal tissues. Taken together, these results supported our hypothesis that VHR expression is down-regulated in cancer cells. VHR is among the first identified mammalian DUSPs (24Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Despite the initial report showing that VHR is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is capable of dephoshorylating various receptor tyrosine kinases in vitro, the majority of the followed researches had focused on the ability of VHR to dephosphorylate and inactivate MAPKs (25Todd J.L. Rigas J.D. Rafty L.A. Denu J.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2573-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 26Todd J.L. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13271-13280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 27Alonso A. Saxena M. Williams S. Mustellin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4766-4771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unlike the typical MKPs, VHR displays a strong preference for dephosphorylating phosphotyrosine residue over phosphothreonine residue (30Schumacher M.A. Todd J.L. Rice A.E. Tanner K.G. Denu J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3009-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although multiple reports have shown that VHR is capable of inactivating ERKs and JNKs, its activity against MAPKs has not been compared with that of MKPs side-by-side. In this study, we first examined the ability of VHR in inactivating MAPKs using an inducible expression system in H1299 NSCLC cell line. We did not find a significant effect of VHR on ERK, p38-MAPK, and JNK (Fig. 1). In contrast, MKP-1, when expressed at a much lower level, can efficiently dephosphorylate JNK, in the same cell line. Using GST fusion recombinant proteins, we also showed that MKP-1 could dephosphorylate JNK1 much more efficiently than did VHR in the same reaction condition (Fig. 2). These data, different from the recent reports, led us to question the role of VHR in MAPK regulation and to speculate about the physiological functions of VHR. Our experimental data were more consistent with the initial report of VHR (24Ishibashi T. Bottaro D.P. Chan A. Miki T. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 12170-12174Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We found that VHR was an ErbB receptor phosphatase. Although VHR can dephosphorylate EGFR on multiple tyrosine residues in vitro, it preferentially reduced EGFR phosphorylation on Tyr-992 in a cellular context (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Consistent with this result, expression of VHR suppressed the activation of PLCγ/PKC pathway (Fig. 5), which is dependent on the EGFR Tyr-992 phosphorylation (31Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), without affecting EGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 1). Interestingly, Src has also been shown to bind to the phospho-Tyr-992 residue of EGFR (32Sierke S.L. Longo G.M. Koland J.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), but we did not find an effect on EGF-induced Src activation by VHR expression (supplemental Fig. S3). It was likely that Src can be activated through multiple phospho-Tyr residues of EGFR and therefore was not affected by VHR. Our data also suggested that VHR could modulate EGFR signaling by dephosphorylating specific tyrosine residues. Both EGFR and ErbB2 signaling are important for the proliferation of epithelial cells. We found that expression of VHR reduced foci formation ability of H1299 cells, whereas decreasing VHR enhanced this ability. We also found that expression of VHR greatly reduced the colony forming ability of H1299 cells in three-dimensional Matrigel culture. Furthermore, expression of VHR suppressed tumor formation by H1299 cells in a mouse xenograft system (Fig. 6). These results were consistent with the suppressive activity of VHR against the EGFR and ErbB2 signaling pathway. We did not detect a significant amount of ErbB2 expression in H1299 cells; therefore, the growth-suppressive effect of VHR likely was not mediated through inhibiting ErbB2. We did not observe significant effects of VHR on Src (supplemental Fig. S3) and c-Met (data not shown). Our data also showed that VHR had a preference among different phosphotyrosine motifs, indicating that VHR is not a nonselective phosphatase. However, VHR may very likely have cellular substrates other than the ErbB receptors; therefore, we cannot conclude that VHR affected cell proliferation only through suppression of EGFR. As reported recently, VHR is involved in dephosphorylating STAT5 at Tyr-694/699 (22Hoyt R. Zhu W. cerignoli F. Alonso A. Mustelin T. David M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 3402-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data and that of others revealed the importance of VHR in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated signaling. Our results also showed that VHR expression levels in NSCLC tissues are lower than those in adjacent normal tissues. The difference in VHR expression between normal lung and NSCLC tissues was statistically significant (Fig. 7). In contrast, the expression of MKP-6, a closely related DUSP, was not apparently different between normal and cancerous tissues. These data, in combination with our biochemical and functional analyses of VHR, suggested that a decrease in VHR expression and a subsequent loss of ability to suppress tyrosine kinase signaling may be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC.

https://openalex.org/W1964392254,"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), encoded by Epstein-Barr virus, is required for EBV-mediated B cell transformation and plays a significant role in the development of posttransplant B cell lymphomas. LMP1 has also been implicated in exacerbation of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. LMP1 is a constitutively active functional mimic of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member CD40, utilizing tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) adaptor proteins to induce signaling. However, LMP1-mediated B cell activation is amplified and sustained compared with CD40. We have previously shown that LMP1 and CD40 use TRAFs 1, 2, 3, and 5 differently. TRAF6 is important for CD40 signaling, but the role of TRAF6 in LMP1 signaling in B cells is not clear. Although TRAF6 binds directly to CD40, TRAF6 interaction with LMP1 in B cells has not been characterized. Here we tested the hypothesis that TRAF6 is a critical regulator of LMP1 signaling in B cells, either as part of a receptor-associated complex and/or as a cytoplasmic adaptor protein. Using TRAF6-deficient B cells, we determined that TRAF6 was critical for LMP1-mediated B cell activation. Although CD40-mediated TRAF6-dependent signaling does not require the TRAF6 receptor-binding domain, we found that LMP1 signaling required the presence of this domain. Furthermore, TRAF6 was recruited to the LMP1 signaling complex via the TRAF1/2/3/5 binding site within the cytoplasmic domain of LMP1."
https://openalex.org/W2058094141,"Chemical control of protein secretion using a small molecule approach provides a powerful tool to optimize tissue engineering strategies by regulating the spatial and temporal dimensions that are exposed to a specific protein. We placed fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) under conditional control of a small molecule and demonstrated greater than 50-fold regulation of FGF-2 release as well as tunability, reversibility, and functionality in vitro. We then applied conditional control of FGF-2 secretion to a cell-based, skeletal tissue engineering construct consisting of adipose stem cells (ASCs) on a biomimetic scaffold to promote bone formation in a murine critical-sized calvarial defect model. ASCs are an easily harvested and abundant source of postnatal multipotent cells and have previously been demonstrated to regenerate bone in critical-sized defects. These results suggest that chemically controlled FGF-2 secretion can significantly increase bone formation by ASCs in vivo. This study represents a novel approach toward refining protein delivery for tissue engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2044675863,"Objectives We hypothesised that assessment of plasma C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1), a stable endothelin-1 precursor fragment, is of prognostic value in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), beyond other prognosticators, including N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Methods We examined 491 patients with systolic CHF (age: 63±11 years, 91% men, New York Heart Association [NYHA] class [I/II/III/IV]: 9%/45%/38%/8%, 69% ischemic etiology). Plasma CT-proET-1 was detected using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Results Increasing CT-proET-1 was a predictor of increased cardiovascular mortality at 12-months of follow-up (standardized hazard ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.95, p = 0.03) after adjusting for NT-proBNP, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), age, creatinine, NYHA class. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under curve for 12-month follow-up were similar for CT-proET-1 and NT-proBNP (p = 0.40). Both NT-proBNP and CT-proET-1 added prognostic value to a base model that included LVEF, age, creatinine, and NYHA class. Adding CT-proET-1 to the base model had stronger prognostic power (p<0.01) than adding NT-proBNP (p<0.01). Adding CT-proET-1 to NT-proBNP in this model yielded further prognostic information (p = 0.02). Conclusions Plasma CT-proET-1 constitutes a novel predictor of increased 12-month cardiovascular mortality in patients with CHF. High CT-proET-1 together with high NT-proBNP enable to identify patients with CHF and particularly unfavourable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1999350860,"Rhythmic behaviors, such as walking and breathing, involve the coordinated activity of central pattern generators in the CNS, sensory feedback from the PNS, to motoneuron output to muscles. Unraveling the intrinsic electrical properties of these cellular components is essential to understanding this coordinated activity. Here, we examine the significance of the transient A-type K(+) current (I(A)), encoded by the highly conserved Shal/K(v)4 gene, in neuronal firing patterns and repetitive behaviors. While I(A) is present in nearly all neurons across species, elimination of I(A) has been complicated in mammals because of multiple genes underlying I(A), and/or electrical remodeling that occurs in response to affecting one gene.In Drosophila, the single Shal/K(v)4 gene encodes the predominant I(A) current in many neuronal cell bodies. Using a transgenically expressed dominant-negative subunit (DNK(v)4), we show that I(A) is completely eliminated from cell bodies, with no effect on other currents. Most notably, DNK(v)4 neurons display multiple defects during prolonged stimuli. DNK(v)4 neurons display shortened latency to firing, a lower threshold for repetitive firing, and a progressive decrement in AP amplitude to an adapted state. We record from identified motoneurons and show that Shal/K(v)4 channels are similarly required for maintaining excitability during repetitive firing. We then examine larval crawling, and adult climbing and grooming, all behaviors that rely on repetitive firing. We show that all are defective in the absence of Shal/K(v)4 function. Further, knock-out of Shal/K(v)4 function specifically in motoneurons significantly affects the locomotion behaviors tested.Based on our results, Shal/K(v)4 channels regulate the initiation of firing, enable neurons to continuously fire throughout a prolonged stimulus, and also influence firing frequency. This study shows that Shal/K(v)4 channels play a key role in repetitively firing neurons during prolonged input/output, and suggests that their function and regulation are important for rhythmic behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W2082986654,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most prevalent inherited childhood muscle disorder in humans. mdx mice exhibit a similar pathophysiology to the human disorder allowing for an in-depth investigation of DMD. Myogenin, a myogenic regulatory factor, is best known for its role in embryonic myogenesis, but its role in adult muscle maintenance and regeneration is still poorly understood. Here, we generated an mdx:Myogflox/flox mouse harboring a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase transgene, which was used to conditionally delete Myog during adult life. After tamoxifen treatment, three groups of mice were created to study the effects of Myog deletion: mdx:Myogflox/flox mice (mdx), Myogflox/flox mice (wild-type), and mdx:MyogfloxΔ/floxΔ:Cre-ER mice (mdx:Myog-deleted). mdx:Myog-deleted mice exhibited no adverse phenotype and behaved normally. When run to exhaustion, mdx:Myog-deleted mice demonstrated an enhanced capacity for exercise compared to mdx mice, running nearly as far as wild-type mice. Moreover, these mice showed the same signature characteristics of muscle regeneration as mdx mice. Unexpectedly, we found that myogenin was dispensable for muscle regeneration. Factors associated with muscle fatigue, metabolism, and proteolysis were significantly altered in mdx:Myog-deleted mice, and this might contribute to their increased exercise capacity. Our results reveal novel functions for myogenin in adult muscle and suggest that reducing Myog expression in other muscle disease models may partially restore muscle function."
https://openalex.org/W2020323092,"Worldwide, Aspergillus flavus is the second leading cause of allergic, invasive and colonizing fungal diseases in humans. However, it is the most common species causing fungal rhinosinusitis and eye infections in tropical countries. Despite the growing challenges due to A. flavus, the molecular epidemiology of this fungus has not been well studied. We evaluated the use of microsatellites for high resolution genotyping of A. flavus from India and a possible connection between clinical presentation and genotype of the involved isolate.A panel of nine microsatellite markers were selected from the genome of A. flavus NRRL 3357. These markers were used to type 162 clinical isolates of A. flavus. All nine markers proved to be polymorphic displaying up to 33 alleles per marker. Thirteen isolates proved to be a mixture of different genotypes. Among the 149 pure isolates, 124 different genotypes could be recognized. The discriminatory power (D) for the individual markers ranged from 0.657 to 0.954. The D value of the panel of nine markers combined was 0.997. The multiplex multicolor approach was instrumental in rapid typing of a large number of isolates. There was no correlation between genotype and the clinical presentation of the infection.There is a large genotypic diversity in clinical A. flavus isolates from India. The presence of more than one genotype in clinical samples illustrates the possibility that persons may be colonized by multiple genotypes and that any isolate from a clinical specimen is not necessarily the one actually causing infection. Microsatellites are excellent typing targets for discriminating between A. flavus isolates from various origins."
https://openalex.org/W2047046134,"Many studies have shown that juvenile salmon imprint olfactory memory of natal stream odors during downstream migration, and adults recall this stream-specific odor information to discriminate their natal stream during upstream migration for spawning. The odor information processing of the natal stream in the salmon brain, however, has not been clarified. We applied blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the odor information processing of the natal stream in the olfactory bulb and telencephalon of lacustrine sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). The strong responses to the natal stream water were mainly observed in the lateral area of dorsal telencephalon (Dl), which are homologous to the medial pallium (hippocampus) in terrestrial vertebrates. Although the concentration of L-serine (1 mM) in the control water was 20,000-times higher than that of total amino acid in the natal stream water (47.5 nM), the BOLD signals resulting from the natal stream water were stronger than those by L-serine in the Dl. We concluded that sockeye salmon could process the odor information of the natal stream by integrating information in the Dl area of the telencephalon."
https://openalex.org/W2080977540,"Insect yolk protein precursor gene expression is regulated by nutritional and endocrine signals. A surge of amino acids in the hemolymph of blood-fed female mosquitoes activates a nutrient signaling system in the fat bodies, which subsequently derepresses yolk protein precursor genes and makes them responsive to activation by steroid hormones.

IntroductionMosquito-transmitted diseases like malaria and dengue fever are a global problem affecting hundreds of millions of people every year. Anautogenous mosquito females require vertebrate blood for reproduction, and it is the vector-host interaction during blood feeding that makes mosquitoes effective vectors for multiple infectious diseases. Blood is the sole source of amino acids (AAs) 3The abbreviations used are: AA, amino acid; YPP, yolk protein precursor; TOR, target of rapamycin; CAT, cationic amino acid transporter; HAT, heterodimeric transporter; TMD, transmembrane domain; DA, dopamine; IV, current-voltage dependence. in adult females, with the exception of stores acquired during the larval phase. Blood meal-derived AAs deliver energy and the essential building blocks for synthesis of yolk protein precursor (YPP) proteins that are deposited into developing eggs by the mother to provide nutrients necessary for embryonic development (1Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Raikhel A.S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 35: 661-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).During mosquito vitellogenesis, YPP gene expression is activated exclusively in the mosquito fat body, the insect analog of the vertebrate liver (2Arrese E.L.

Cell Metabolism. 2007; 6: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Blood meal-derived AAs stimulate YPP genes via the target of rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction pathway (4Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This group includes the three cationic AAs, arginine, histidine, and lysine. Treatment of fat bodies with amino acid uptake inhibitors ouabain and bafilomycin resulted in inhibition of the amino acid-induced YPP gene expression, proving that facilitated transport is involved in the AA signaling mechanism (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of the transmembrane signaling and transporting events that cause fat body activation in mosquitoes is unknown.In previous work, we cloned two putative orphan AA transporters that belong to the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) subfamily of the SLC7 (solute carrier family 7) (7Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) from the fat body of Aedes aegypti females, AaCAT1 and AaCAT2. AaCAT1, originally named slif (A. aegypti slimfast), was renamed after more sequence data became available (see below). RNAi-mediated knockdown of both transporters resulted in a strong decrease in the transcriptional response of YPP genes to amino acid stimulation similar to that observed during TOR inhibition (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest that these two SLC-7 transporters are part of the TOR-signaling cascade, upstream of the TOR kinase.In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, three types of secondary transporters from the SLC7 and SLC36 families act as regulators of cell growth via TOR signaling. One of them, Drosophila SLIF, is part of the larval fat body nutrient sensor mechanism. It genetically interacts with the TOR signaling pathway in the fat body and mediates the repression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in peripheral tissues by an undefined endocrine regulator (8Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Hennig et al. (9Hennig K.M. Colombani J. Neufeld T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have found that TOR signaling stimulates general endocytotic uptake of a hexamerin storage protein, whereas it inhibits the endocytotic uptake and degradation of SLIF protein in the larval fat body, resulting in a positive effect on bulk endocytosis and a negative effect on endocytotic degradation. Fat body SLIF is associated with the regulation of lipid accumulation in oenocytes of Drosophila larvae (10Gutierrez E. Wiggins D. Fielding B. Gould A.P. Nature. 2007; 445: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar).An AA transporter of the SLC36 family in Drosophila, pathetic (PATH), also regulates TOR activity in different tissues. This transporter has a very low transport capacity and an exceptionally high substrate affinity, and it was suggested that PATH may control growth by functioning as an AA sensor or transceptor (11Goberdhan D.C. Meredith D. Boyd C.A. Wilson C. Development. 2005; 132: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A third AA transporter, MINIDISCS, a light chain subunit of the heterodimeric transporter (HAT)-SLC7 subfamily is essential for amino acid-activated endocrine regulation of fly growth by the fat body (12Martin J.F. Hersperger E. Simcox A. Shearn A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Here we report the molecular and functional characterization of AaCAT1 from the yellow fever mosquito, A. aegypti. The AaCAT1 transcript and protein expression profiles were determined during mosquito postembryonic development, and functional electrochemical characterization was conducted using heterologous expression of AaCAT1 transcript in Xenopus laevis oocytes with subsequent electrophysiological recording of amino acid-induced currents and quantitative radiolabeled amino acid uptake assays.DISCUSSIONReproductive success in anautogenous female mosquitoes depends on vitellogenesis, the rapid conversion of blood meal proteins into mosquito yolk proteins for deposition in developing eggs. Yolk proteins are used in embryonic and early postembryonic development of mosquitoes. The nutrient signaling and transport processes underlying vitellogenesis are only partly understood. Previous studies have shown that AaCAT1 and AaCAT2 are part of the fat body nutrient AA signaling system and necessary for the onset of vitellogenesis after a blood meal (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the transport functions of these transporters in mosquitoes were unknown and impossible to predict because no closely related transporters were characterized at this time. The present study reveals the phylogenetic relationships, transport function, and expression patterns of AaCAT1 and shows that it is essential for efficient mosquito egg development in the yellow fever mosquito, A. aegypti.AaCAT1 is a member of the CAT subfamily of the SLC7 family of AA transporters, which has a characteristic 14-TMD structure that differentiates the CAT subfamily from the 12-TMD-containing members of the neighboring HAT subfamily (27Hediger M.A. Romero M.F. Peng J.B. Rolfs A. Takanaga H. Bruford E.A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The results of our analysis (Fig. 1) suggest that CATs evolved upon duplication of the last two TMDs in an ancestral 12-TMD-containing HAT-like transporter. This duplication might have resulted in the loss of the functional requirement of these proteins for an auxiliary subunit, as seen in the HAT subfamily. Functional expression of HAT requires the association of a core SLC7 subunit with an auxiliary subunit from the SLC3 family, whereas such association is not required for functional expression of CAT proteins (7Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Three of the five mammalian CAT-SLC7 transporters are characterized. All characterized mammalian CATs (SLC7A1 to -3, also called CAT1 to -3) resemble transporters from the y+ transport system, which in general mediate transport of cationic AAs in plasma membrane of cells of different tissues (28Closs E.I. Boissel J.P. Habermeier A. Rotmann A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The characterized mammalian transporters predominantly transport Lys and Arg and act as exchangers or facilitators.Until now, the functions of CATs in non-mammalian model systems were ambiguous and widely inferred based on the phylogenetic proximity of predicted protein sequences. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the CAT and HAT subfamily diverged from a common ancestor around 2.6 billion years ago. AaCAT1 and AaCAT3, together with Drosophila SLIF, form the most recent ∼100 million-year-old expansion in the CAT subfamily, which is clearly separated from the mammalian and nematode CATs (Fig. 2). Therefore, the function of AaCAT1-like transporters cannot be inferred through phylogenetic proximity to the characterized vertebrate transporters and can only be determined by direct assay. This also raises the possibility that specific inhibitors to these transporters could be identified with little or no effect on the vertebrate counterparts.We were able to express AaCAT1 in a heterologous expression system suitable for comprehensive analysis of transport proteins. The results obtained from the analysis of AaCAT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggest that AaCAT1 acts as a histidine-selective transporter with relatively high affinity to l-His (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Therefore, its properties differ from the classical y+ system that does not discriminate cationic amino acids and has even better capacity to transport arginine and lysine (29Devés R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition, AaCAT1 displays strong stereo-specificity toward the l-enantiomer of its substrate (Fig. 5). With notably less substrate-induced current, it responds to l-ornithine but not to other tested metabolic amino acids. Among amino acid-derived neurotransmitters, only DA induces notable changes in AaCAT1-associated currents (Fig. 3); however, the functional significance of this interaction is not clear.The estimated affinity of AaCAT1 for His was 5 times higher than the previously reported Km of l-Arg transport by mouse CAT-1 (30Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and is comparable with other reported Km values for mammalian CAT1 and CAT2 interacting with their preferred substrates: arginine, lysine, and ornithine (29Devés R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, l-histidine transport by these CATs was notably smaller (30Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and was only detectable at low pH, where His is predominantly protonated (31Vékony N. Wolf S. Boissel J.P. Gnauert K. Closs E.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12387-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In our analysis, AaCAT1 generated large currents at neutral pH 7.2 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The current-derived calculations of the affinity constant consider only the charged fraction of the substrate. The actual affinity of AaCAT to His+ could be significantly higher (e.g. E0.5l-His+ = 20.7 ± 4 μm and K0.5l-His = 27.5 ± 10.37 μm (considering 6.1% protonated His+ at pH 7.2). Hence, selective interaction with His+ may cause interesting phenomena in the function of AaCAT1. First, it shifts this transport mechanism into a high affinity region, which is typically identified for transporters with narrow substrate specificity. Second, upon acidification of the extracellular medium, a significant amplification of substrate-mediated electrical or chemical signals might occur on the cell membrane of AaCAT1-expressing cells.We attempted to analyze AaCAT1 function at alkaline conditions. Unexpectedly, we identified significant endogenous cationic amino acid-induced currents that interfere with AaCAT1 activity. Alkalinization to pH 8.2 enables quasiuniform Arg+, Lys+, and His+ currents in both AaCAT1 and control uninjected oocytes. Therefore, we cannot make any statements regarding the function of AaCAT1 in alkaline conditions.It is possible that AaCAT1 acts as a transceptor involved in both transport and signaling processes. This would comprise a unique mechanism for signaling of changes in concentrations of essential l-His in the mosquito hemolymph, and such a signal could be amplified upon acidification. Additional studies on AaCAT1 function are necessary to test this interesting hypothesis.The AaCAT1 gene has a unique expression pattern (Fig. 8). mRNA is detectable during the fourth larval instar, but the AaCAT1 protein was not detected until the pupal and adult stages. These data suggest that AaCAT1 has no role in embryonic or postembryonic developmental processes and that its function is probably adult-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an AA transporter with such restricted expression patterns; the closely related Drosophila SLC-7 transporter slif is strongly expressed in larval stages of fruit flies and plays a prominent role in the regulation of larval development (8Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). AaCAT1 mRNA expression was detected in many organs/body parts with the exception of the head, with high relative expression levels in the flight muscle tissue of the thorax. The functional significance of this finding is unclear.Injection of dsRNA into the hemocoel of adult mosquitoes has been shown to be an effective method to achieve strong RNAi-mediated gene knockdowns in a variety of different tissues (4Hansen I.A.

Hansen I.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and overall knockdown of AaCAT1 was very strong after injection (Fig. 9A). Knockdown of AaCAT1 resulted in a significant reduction in egg numbers (Fig. 9B), similar to reductions that have been observed as a result of the knockdown of other proteins of the fat body nutrient signaling cascade in mosquitoes (4Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Roy S.G. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol.

However, the finding that AaCAT1 knockdown mosquitoes are still able to produce a considerable number of viable eggs suggests that there are redundant AA signaling and transport systems that perform similar tasks as this protein.In summary, we report the characterization of a mosquito CAT with strong substrate specificity to l-histidine as never before reported for a member of the SLC7-CAT subfamily. AaCAT1 has a unique expression profile and is only found in pupae and adult mosquitoes. It is part of the AA signaling pathway and is involved in mosquito egg development.Several facts make this transporter an interesting target for the development of novel, environmentally safe insecticides. First, it forms a distinct phylogenetic cluster with other insect CATs; second, its transport characteristics are very unlike vertebrate CATs (it specifically transports an essential AA); and third, it is part of the mosquito nutrient-sensing system and is associated with insect reproduction.

During mosquito vitellogenesis, YPP gene expression is activated exclusively in the mosquito fat body, the insect analog of the vertebrate liver (2Arrese E.L. Soulages J.L. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2010; 55: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 3Baker K.D. Thummel C.S. Cell Metabolism. 2007; 6: 257-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Blood meal-derived AAs stimulate YPP genes via the target of rapamycin (TOR) signal transduction pathway (4Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Roy S.G. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20565-20572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Several AAs are essential for the activation of YPP genes in the fat body. This group includes the three cationic AAs, arginine, histidine, and lysine. Treatment of fat bodies with amino acid uptake inhibitors ouabain and bafilomycin resulted in inhibition of the amino acid-induced YPP gene expression, proving that facilitated transport is involved in the AA signaling mechanism (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the exact nature of the transmembrane signaling and transporting events that cause fat body activation in mosquitoes is unknown. In previous work, we cloned two putative orphan AA transporters that belong to the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT) subfamily of the SLC7 (solute carrier family 7) (7Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) from the fat body of Aedes aegypti females, AaCAT1 and AaCAT2. AaCAT1, originally named slif (A. aegypti slimfast), was renamed after more sequence data became available (see below). RNAi-mediated knockdown of both transporters resulted in a strong decrease in the transcriptional response of YPP genes to amino acid stimulation similar to that observed during TOR inhibition (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest that these two SLC-7 transporters are part of the TOR-signaling cascade, upstream of the TOR kinase. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, three types of secondary transporters from the SLC7 and SLC36 families act as regulators of cell growth via TOR signaling. One of them, Drosophila SLIF, is part of the larval fat body nutrient sensor mechanism. It genetically interacts with the TOR signaling pathway in the fat body and mediates the repression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling in peripheral tissues by an undefined endocrine regulator (8Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Hennig et al. (9Hennig K.M. Colombani J. Neufeld T.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 963-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) have found that TOR signaling stimulates general endocytotic uptake of a hexamerin storage protein, whereas it inhibits the endocytotic uptake and degradation of SLIF protein in the larval fat body, resulting in a positive effect on bulk endocytosis and a negative effect on endocytotic degradation. Fat body SLIF is associated with the regulation of lipid accumulation in oenocytes of Drosophila larvae (10Gutierrez E. Wiggins D. Fielding B. Gould A.P. Nature. 2007; 445: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). An AA transporter of the SLC36 family in Drosophila, pathetic (PATH), also regulates TOR activity in different tissues. This transporter has a very low transport capacity and an exceptionally high substrate affinity, and it was suggested that PATH may control growth by functioning as an AA sensor or transceptor (11Goberdhan D.C. Meredith D. Boyd C.A. Wilson C. Development. 2005; 132: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A third AA transporter, MINIDISCS, a light chain subunit of the heterodimeric transporter (HAT)-SLC7 subfamily is essential for amino acid-activated endocrine regulation of fly growth by the fat body (12Martin J.F. Hersperger E. Simcox A. Shearn A. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular and functional characterization of AaCAT1 from the yellow fever mosquito, A. aegypti. The AaCAT1 transcript and protein expression profiles were determined during mosquito postembryonic development, and functional electrochemical characterization was conducted using heterologous expression of AaCAT1 transcript in Xenopus laevis oocytes with subsequent electrophysiological recording of amino acid-induced currents and quantitative radiolabeled amino acid uptake assays. DISCUSSIONReproductive success in anautogenous female mosquitoes depends on vitellogenesis, the rapid conversion of blood meal proteins into mosquito yolk proteins for deposition in developing eggs. Yolk proteins are used in embryonic and early postembryonic development of mosquitoes. The nutrient signaling and transport processes underlying vitellogenesis are only partly understood. Previous studies have shown that AaCAT1 and AaCAT2 are part of the fat body nutrient AA signaling system and necessary for the onset of vitellogenesis after a blood meal (6Attardo G.M. Hansen I.A. Shiao S.H. Raikhel A.S. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 3071-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, the transport functions of these transporters in mosquitoes were unknown and impossible to predict because no closely related transporters were characterized at this time. The present study reveals the phylogenetic relationships, transport function, and expression patterns of AaCAT1 and shows that it is essential for efficient mosquito egg development in the yellow fever mosquito, A. aegypti.AaCAT1 is a member of the CAT subfamily of the SLC7 family of AA transporters, which has a characteristic 14-TMD structure that differentiates the CAT subfamily from the 12-TMD-containing members of the neighboring HAT subfamily (27Hediger M.A. Romero M.F. Peng J.B. Rolfs A. Takanaga H. Bruford E.A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 465-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The results of our analysis (Fig. 1) suggest that CATs evolved upon duplication of the last two TMDs in an ancestral 12-TMD-containing HAT-like transporter. This duplication might have resulted in the loss of the functional requirement of these proteins for an auxiliary subunit, as seen in the HAT subfamily. Functional expression of HAT requires the association of a core SLC7 subunit with an auxiliary subunit from the SLC3 family, whereas such association is not required for functional expression of CAT proteins (7Verrey F. Closs E.I. Wagner C.A. Palacin M. Endou H. Kanai Y. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Three of the five mammalian CAT-SLC7 transporters are characterized. All characterized mammalian CATs (SLC7A1 to -3, also called CAT1 to -3) resemble transporters from the y+ transport system, which in general mediate transport of cationic AAs in plasma membrane of cells of different tissues (28Closs E.I. Boissel J.P. Habermeier A. Rotmann A. J. Membr. Biol. 2006; 213: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The characterized mammalian transporters predominantly transport Lys and Arg and act as exchangers or facilitators.Until now, the functions of CATs in non-mammalian model systems were ambiguous and widely inferred based on the phylogenetic proximity of predicted protein sequences. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the CAT and HAT subfamily diverged from a common ancestor around 2.6 billion years ago. AaCAT1 and AaCAT3, together with Drosophila SLIF, form the most recent ∼100 million-year-old expansion in the CAT subfamily, which is clearly separated from the mammalian and nematode CATs (Fig. 2). Therefore, the function of AaCAT1-like transporters cannot be inferred through phylogenetic proximity to the characterized vertebrate transporters and can only be determined by direct assay. This also raises the possibility that specific inhibitors to these transporters could be identified with little or no effect on the vertebrate counterparts.We were able to express AaCAT1 in a heterologous expression system suitable for comprehensive analysis of transport proteins. The results obtained from the analysis of AaCAT1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes suggest that AaCAT1 acts as a histidine-selective transporter with relatively high affinity to l-His (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Therefore, its properties differ from the classical y+ system that does not discriminate cationic amino acids and has even better capacity to transport arginine and lysine (29Devés R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition, AaCAT1 displays strong stereo-specificity toward the l-enantiomer of its substrate (Fig. 5). With notably less substrate-induced current, it responds to l-ornithine but not to other tested metabolic amino acids. Among amino acid-derived neurotransmitters, only DA induces notable changes in AaCAT1-associated currents (Fig. 3); however, the functional significance of this interaction is not clear.The estimated affinity of AaCAT1 for His was 5 times higher than the previously reported Km of l-Arg transport by mouse CAT-1 (30Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and is comparable with other reported Km values for mammalian CAT1 and CAT2 interacting with their preferred substrates: arginine, lysine, and ornithine (29Devés R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, l-histidine transport by these CATs was notably smaller (30Kim J.W. Closs E.I. Albritton L.M. Cunningham J.M. Nature. 1991; 352: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and was only detectable at low pH, where His is predominantly protonated (31Vékony N. Wolf S. Boissel J.P. Gnauert K. Closs E.I. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12387-12394Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In our analysis, AaCAT1 generated large currents at neutral pH 7.2 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). The current-derived calculations of the affinity constant consider only the charged fraction of the substrate. The actual affinity of AaCAT to His+ could be significantly higher (e.g. E0.5l-His+ = 20.7 ± 4 μm and K0.5l-His = 27.5 ± 10.37 μm (considering 6.1% protonated His+ at pH 7.2). Hence, selective interaction with His+ may cause interesting phenomena in the function of AaCAT1. First, it shifts this transport mechanism into a high affinity region, which is typically identified for transporters with narrow substrate specificity. Second, upon acidification of the extracellular medium, a significant amplification of substrate-mediated electrical or chemical signals might occur on the cell membrane of AaCAT1-expressing cells.We attempted to analyze AaCAT1 function at alkaline conditions. Unexpectedly, we identified significant endogenous cationic amino acid-induced currents that interfere with AaCAT1 activity. Alkalinization to pH 8.2 enables quasiuniform Arg+, Lys+, and His+ currents in both AaCAT1 and control uninjected oocytes. Therefore, we cannot make any statements regarding the function of AaCAT1 in alkaline conditions.It is possible that AaCAT1 acts as a transceptor involved in both transport and signaling processes. This would comprise a unique mechanism for signaling of changes in concentrations of essential l-His in the mosquito hemolymph, and such a signal could be amplified upon acidification. Additional studies on AaCAT1 function are necessary to test this interesting hypothesis.The AaCAT1 gene has a unique expression pattern (Fig. 8). mRNA is detectable during the fourth larval instar, but the AaCAT1 protein was not detected until the pupal and adult stages. These data suggest that AaCAT1 has no role in embryonic or postembryonic developmental processes and that its function is probably adult-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an AA transporter with such restricted expression patterns; the closely related Drosophila SLC-7 transporter slif is strongly expressed in larval stages of fruit flies and plays a prominent role in the regulation of larval development (8Colombani J. Raisin S. Pantalacci S. Radimerski T. Montagne J. Léopold P. Cell. 2003; 114: 739-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). AaCAT1 mRNA expression was detected in many organs/body parts with the exception of the head, with high relative expression levels in the flight muscle tissue of the thorax. The functional significance of this finding is unclear.Injection of dsRNA into the hemocoel of adult mosquitoes has been shown to be an effective method to achieve strong RNAi-mediated gene knockdowns in a variety of different tissues (4Hansen I.A.

Hansen I.A. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and overall knockdown of AaCAT1 was very strong after injection (Fig. 9A). Knockdown of AaCAT1 resulted in a significant reduction in egg numbers (Fig. 9B), similar to reductions that have been observed as a result of the knockdown of other proteins of the fat body nutrient signaling cascade in mosquitoes (4Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Park J.H. Peng Q. Raikhel A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 5Hansen I.A. Attardo G.M. Roy S.G. Raikhel A.S. J. Biol.

However, the finding that AaCAT1 knockdown mosquitoes are still able to produce a considerable number of viable eggs suggests that there are redundant AA signaling and transport systems that perform similar tasks as this protein.In summary, we report the characterization of a mosquito CAT with strong substrate specificity to l-histidine as never before reported for a member of the SLC7-CAT subfamily. AaCAT1 has a unique expression profile and is only found in pupae and adult mosquitoes. It is part of the AA signaling pathway and is involved in mosquito egg development.Several facts make this transporter an interesting target for the development of novel, environmentally safe insecticides. First, it forms a distinct phylogenetic cluster with other insect CATs; second, its transport characteristics are very unlike vertebrate CATs (it specifically transports an essential AA); and third, it is part of the mosquito nutrient-sensing system and is associated with insect reproduction.

https://openalex.org/W2004057669,"Aquatic hyphomycete fungi are fundamental mediators of energy flow and nutrient spiraling in rivers. These microscopic fungi are primarily dispersed in river currents, undergo substantial annual fluctuations in abundance, and reproduce either predominantly or exclusively asexually. These aspects of aquatic hyphomycete biology are expected to influence levels and distributions of genetic diversity over both spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of genotypic diversity in the representative aquatic hyphomycete Tetracladium marchalianum. We sampled populations of this fungus from seven sites, three sites each in two rivers in Illinois, USA, and one site in a Wisconsin river, USA, and repeatedly sampled one population over two years to track population genetic parameters through two seasonal cycles. The resulting fungal isolates (N = 391) were genotyped at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. In spite of seasonal reductions in the abundance of this species, genotypic diversity was consistently very high and allele frequencies remarkably stable over time. Likewise, genotypic diversity was very high at all sites. Genetic differentiation was only observed between the most distant rivers (∼450 km). Clear evidence that T. marchalianum reproduces sexually in nature was not observed. Additionally, we used phylogenetic analysis of partial β-tubulin gene sequences to confirm that the fungal isolates studied here represent a single species. These results suggest that populations of T. marchalianum may be very large and highly connected at local scales. We speculate that large population sizes and colonization of alternate substrates in both terrestrial and aquatic environments may effectively buffer the aquatic populations from in-stream population fluctuations and facilitate stability in allele frequencies over time. These data also suggest that overland dispersal is more important for structuring populations of T. marchalianum over geographic scales than expected."
https://openalex.org/W2053617352,"Significant cocoa production in the municipality of Waslala, Nicaragua, began in 1961. Since the 1980s, its economic importance to rural smallholders increased, and the region now contributes more than 50% of national cocoa bean production. This research aimed to assist local farmers to develop production of high-value cocoa based on optimal use of cacao biodiversity. Using microsatellite markers, the allelic composition and genetic structure of cacao was assessed from 44 representative plantings and two unmanaged trees. The population at Waslala consists of only three putative founder genotype spectra (lineages). Two (B and R) were introduced during the past 50 years and occur in >95% of all trees sampled, indicating high rates of outcrossing. Based on intermediate allelic diversity, there was large farm-to-farm multilocus genotypic variation. GIS analysis revealed unequal distribution of the genotype spectra, with R being frequent within a 2 km corridor along roads, and B at more remote sites with lower precipitation. The third lineage, Y, was detected in the two forest trees. For explaining the spatial stratification of the genotype spectra, both human intervention and a combination of management and selection driven by environmental conditions, appear responsible. Genotypes of individual trees were highly diverse across plantings, thus enabling selection for farm-specific qualities. On-farm populations can currently be most clearly recognized by the degree of the contribution of the three genotype spectra. Of two possible strategies for future development of cacao in Waslala, i.e. introducing more unrelated germplasm, or working with existing on-site diversity, the latter seems most appropriate. Superior genotypes could be selected by their specific composite genotype spectra as soon as associations with desired quality traits are established, and clonally multiplied. The two Y trees from the forest share a single multilocus genotype, possibly representing the Mayan, 'ancient Criollo' cacao."
https://openalex.org/W2069458976,"We previously reported that the USP19 deubiquitinating enzyme positively regulates proliferation in fibroblasts by stabilizing KPC1, a ubiquitin ligase for p27(Kip1). To explore whether this role of USP19 extends to other cellular systems, we tested the effects of silencing of USP19 in several human prostate and breast models, including carcinoma cell lines. Depletion of USP19 inhibited proliferation in prostate cancer DU145, PC-3 and 22RV1 cells, which was similar to the pattern established in fibroblasts in that it was due to decreased progression from G1 to S phase and associated with a stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). However, in contrast to previous findings in fibroblasts, the stabilization of p27(Kip1) upon USP19 depletion was not associated with changes in the levels of the KPC1 ligase. USP19 could also regulate the growth of immortalized MCF10A breast epithelial cells through a similar mechanism. This regulatory pattern was lost, though, in breast cancer MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Of interest, the transformation of fibroblasts through overexpression of an oncogenic form of Ras disrupted the USP19-mediated regulation of cell growth and of levels of p27(Kip1) and KPC1. Thus, the cell context appears determinant for the ability of USP19 to regulate cell proliferation and p27(Kip1) levels. This may occur through both KPC1 dependent and independent mechanisms. Moreover, a complete loss of USP19 function on cell growth may arise as a result of oncogenic transformation of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974273388,"The IKKβ is known to regulate transcription factor NF-κB activation leading to inflammatory responses. Recent gene knockout studies have shown that IKKβ can orchestrate local inflammatory responses and regulate homeostasis of epithelial tissues. To investigate whether IKKβ has an intrinsic role in epithelial cells, we established an in vivo system in the immune privileged corneal epithelium. We generated triple transgenic Krt12rtTA/rtTAt/tet-O-Cre/IkkβF/F (IkkβΔCE/ΔCE) mice by crossing the Krt12-rtTA knock-in mice, which express the reverse tetracycline transcription activator in corneal epithelial cells, with the tet-O-Cre and IkkβF/F mice. Doxcycline-induced IKKβ ablation occurred in corneal epithelial cells of triple transgenic IkkβΔCE/ΔCE mice, but loss of IKKβ did not cause ocular abnormalities in fetal development and postnatal maintenance. Instead, loss of IKKβ significantly delayed healing of corneal epithelial debridement without affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis or macrophage infiltration. In vitro studies with human corneal epithelial cells (HCEpi) also showed that IKKβ was required for cytokine-induced cell migration and wound closure but was dispensable for cell proliferation. In both in vivo and in vitro settings, IKKβ was required for optimal activation of NF-κB and p38 signaling in corneal epithelial cells, and p38 activation is likely mediated through formation of an IKKβ-p38 protein complex. Thus, our studies in corneal epithelium reveal a previously un-recognized role for IKKβ in the control of epithelial cell motility and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2069194695,"Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are frequently occurring disorders diagnosed by deficits in three core functional areas: social skills, communication, and behaviours and/or interests. Mental retardation frequently accompanies the most severe forms of ASDs, while overall ASDs are more commonly diagnosed in males. Most ASDs have a genetic origin and one gene recently implicated in the etiology of autism is the Deleted-In-Autism-1 (DIA1) gene. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a bioinformatics-based approach, we have identified a human gene closely related to DIA1, we term DIA1R (DIA1-Related). While DIA1 is autosomal (chromosome 3, position 3q24), DIA1R localizes to the X chromosome at position Xp11.3 and is known to escape X-inactivation. The gene products are of similar size, with DIA1 encoding 430, and DIA1R 433, residues. At the amino acid level, DIA1 and DIA1R are 62% similar overall (28% identical), and both encode signal peptides for targeting to the secretory pathway. Both genes are ubiquitously expressed, including in fetal and adult brain tissue. Conclusions/Significance Examination of published literature revealed point mutations in DIA1R are associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) and DIA1R deletion is associated with syndromes with ASD-like traits and/or XLMR. Together, these results support a model where the DIA1 and DIA1R gene products regulate molecular traffic through the cellular secretory pathway or affect the function of secreted factors, and functional deficits cause disorders with ASD-like symptoms and/or mental retardation."
https://openalex.org/W2034399987,"While insulin signaling has been extensively studied in Caenorhabditis elegans in the context of ageing and stress response, less is known about the factors underlying the secretion of insulin ligands upstream of the insulin receptor. Activation of the receptor governs the decision whether to progress through the reproductive lifecycle or to arrest growth and enter hibernation. We find that animals with reduced levels of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocase homologue TOMM-40 arrest growth as larvae and have decreased insulin signaling strength. TOMM-40 acts as a mitochondrial translocase in C. elegans and in its absence animals fail to import a mitochondrial protein reporter across the mitochondrial membrane(s). Inactivation of TOMM-40 evokes the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and causes a collapse of the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Consequently these broadly dysfunctional mitochondria render an inability to couple food abundance to secretion of DAF-28/insulin. The secretion defect is not general in nature since two other neuropeptides, ANF::GFP and INS-22::VENUS, are secreted normally. RNAi against two other putative members of the TOMM complex give similar phenotypes, implying that DAF-28 secretion is sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction in general. We conclude that mitochondrial function is required for C. elegans to secrete DAF-28/insulin when food is abundant. This modulation of secretion likely represents an additional level of control over DAF-28/insulin function."
https://openalex.org/W2060287164,"The molecular basis for retention of integral membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not well understood. We recently discovered a novel ER molecular chaperone termed Cosmc, which is essential for folding and normal activity of the Golgi enzyme T-synthase. Cosmc, a type II single-pass transmembrane protein, lacks any known ER retrieval/retention motifs. To explore specific ER localization determinants in Cosmc we generated a series of Cosmc mutants along with chimeras of Cosmc with a non-ER resident type II protein, the human transferrin receptor. Here we show that the 18 amino acid transmembrane domain (TMD) of Cosmc is essential for ER localization and confers ER retention to select chimeras. Moreover, mutations of a single Cys residue within the TMD of Cosmc prevent formation of disulfide-bonded dimers of Cosmc and eliminate ER retention. These studies reveal that Cosmc has a unique ER-retention motif within its TMD and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which TMDs of resident ER proteins contribute to ER localization."
https://openalex.org/W1994594333,"Wnt signaling regulates embryo development and tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation leads to an array of diseases, including cancer. Dapper1 has been shown to be a key negative regulator of Wnt signaling. However, its function and regulation remain poorly understood. In this study, we report that 14-3-3β interacts with human Dapper1 (hDpr1). The interaction is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of hDpr1 at Ser-237 and Ser-827. 14-3-3β binding attenuates the ability of hDpr1 to promote Dishevelled (Dvl) degradation, thus enhancing Wnt signaling. We further provide evidence that PKA-mediated Dpr1 phosphorylation may contribute to growth and tumor formation of colon cancer Caco2 cells. Finally, we show that cyclooxygenase-2 expression and PKA activation are positively correlated with Dvl protein levels in colon cancer samples. Together, our findings establish a novel layer of regulation of Wnt signaling by PKA via the 14-3-3-Dpr1-Dvl axis."
https://openalex.org/W2087843002,"Background The heparin-binding plasma protein histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG; alternatively, HRGP/HPRG) can suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth in vitro and in vivo. Mice lacking the HRG gene are viable and fertile, but have an enhanced coagulation resulting in decreased bleeding times. In addition, the angiogenic switch is significantly enhanced in HRG-deficient mice. Methodology/Principal Findings To address whether HRG deficiency affects tumor development, we have crossed HRG knockout mice with the RIP1-Tag2 mouse, a well established orthotopic model of multistage carcinogenesis. RIP1-Tag2 HRG−/− mice display significantly larger tumor volume compared to their RIP1-Tag2 HRG+/+ littermates, supporting a role for HRG as an endogenous regulator of tumor growth. In the present study we also demonstrate that platelet activation is increased in mice lacking HRG. To address whether this elevated platelet activation contributes to the increased pathological angiogenesis in HRG-deficient mice, they were rendered thrombocytopenic before the onset of the angiogenic switch by injection of the anti-platelet antibody GP1bα. Interestingly, this treatment suppressed the increase in angiogenic neoplasias seen in HRG knockout mice. However, if GP1bα treatment was initiated at a later stage, after the onset of the angiogenic switch, no suppression of tumor growth was detected in HRG-deficient mice. Conclusions Our data show that increased platelet activation mediates the accelerated angiogenic switch in HRG-deficient mice. Moreover, we conclude that platelets play a crucial role in the early stages of tumor development but are of less significance for tumor growth once angiogenesis has been initiated."
https://openalex.org/W2035849143,"The PARP family member poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3 (PARP3) is structurally related to the well characterized PARP1 that orchestrates cellular responses to DNA strand breaks and cell death by the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose). In contrast to PARP1 and PARP2, the functions of PARP3 are undefined. Here, we reveal critical functions for PARP3 during vertebrate development.We have used several in vitro and in vivo approaches to examine the possible functions of PARP3 as a transcriptional regulator, a function suggested from its previously reported association with several Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. We demonstrate that PARP3 gene occupancy in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH occurs preferentially with developmental genes regulating cell fate specification, tissue patterning, craniofacial development and neurogenesis. Addressing the significance of this association during zebrafish development, we show that morpholino oligonucleotide-directed inhibition of parp3 expression in zebrafish impairs the expression of the neural crest cell specifier sox9a and of dlx3b/dlx4b, the formation of cranial sensory placodes, inner ears and pectoral fins. It delays pigmentation and severely impedes the development of the median fin fold and tail bud.Our findings demonstrate that Parp3 is crucial in the early stages of zebrafish development, possibly by exerting its transcriptional regulatory functions as early as during the specification of the neural plate border."
https://openalex.org/W2003650957,"Background p66Shc, an isoform of Shc adaptor proteins, mediates diverse signals, including cellular stress and mouse longevity. p66Shc protein level is elevated in several carcinomas and steroid-treated human cancer cells. Several lines of evidence indicate that p66Shc plays a critical role in steroid-related carcinogenesis, and steroids play a role in its elevated levels in those cells without known mechanism. Methods and Findings In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which steroid hormones up-regulate p66Shc protein level. In steroid-treated human prostate and ovarian cancer cells, p66Shc protein levels were elevated, correlating with increased cell proliferation. These steroid effects on p66Shc protein and cell growth were competed out by the respective antagonist. Further, actinomycin D and cyclohexamide could only partially block the elevated p66Shc protein level by steroids. Treatment with proteasomal inhibitors, but not lysosomal protease inhibitor, resulted in elevated p66Shc protein levels, even higher than that by steroids. Using prostate cancer cells as a model, immunoprecipitation revealed that androgens and proteasomal inhibitors reduce the ubiquitinated p66Shc proteins. Conclusions The data collectively indicate that functional steroid receptors are required in steroid up-regulation of p66Shc protein levels in prostate and ovarian cancer cells, correlating with cell proliferation. In these steroid-treated cells, elevated p66Shc protein level is apparently in part due to inhibiting its ubiquitination. The results may lead to an impact on advanced cancer therapy via the regulation of p66Shc protein by up-regulating its ubiquitination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2011319007,"There is a remarkable diversity of song-learning strategies in songbirds. Establishing whether a species is closed- or open-ended is important to be able to interpret functional and evolutionary consequences of variation in repertoire size. Most of our knowledge regarding the timing of vocal learning is based on laboratory studies, despite the fact that these may not always replicate the complex ecological and social interactions experienced by birds in the wild. Given that field studies cannot provide the experimental control of laboratory studies, it may not be surprising that species such as the great tit that were initially assumed to be closed-ended learners have later been suggested to be open-ended learners. By using an established colour-ringed population, by following a standardized recording protocol, and by taking into account the species' song ecology (using only recordings obtained during peak of singing at dawn), we replicated two previous studies to assess song repertoire learning and flexibility in adult wild great tits elicited by social interactions. First, we performed a playback experiment to test repertoire plasticity elicited by novel versus own songs. Additionally, in a longitudinal study, we followed 30 males in two consecutive years and analysed whether new neighbours influenced any change in the repertoire. Contrary to the previous studies, song repertoire size and composition were found to be highly repeatable both between years and after confrontation with a novel song. Our results suggest that great tits are closed-ended learners and that their song repertoire probably does not change during adulthood. Methodological differences that may have led to an underestimation of the repertoires or population differences may explain the discrepancy in results with previous studies. We argue that a rigorous and standardized assessment of the repertoire is essential when studying age- or playback-induced changes in repertoire size and composition under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2125922880,"Structures of the multidrug-binding repressor protein QacR with monovalent and bivalent cationic drugs revealed that the carboxylate side-chains of E90 and E120 were proximal to the positively charged nitrogens of the ligands ethidium, malachite green and rhodamine 6G, and therefore may contribute to drug neutralization and binding affinity. Here, we report structural, biochemical and in vivo effects of substituting these glutamate residues. Unexpectedly, substitutions had little impact on ligand affinity or in vivo induction capabilities. Structures of QacR(E90Q) and QacR(E120Q) with ethidium or malachite green took similar global conformations that differed significantly from all previously described QacR-drug complexes but still prohibited binding to cognate DNA. Strikingly, the QacR(E90Q)-rhodamine 6G complex revealed two mutually exclusive rhodamine 6G binding sites. Despite multiple structural changes, all drug binding was essentially isoenergetic. Thus, these data strongly suggest that rather than contributing significantly to ligand binding affinity, the role of acidic residues lining the QacR multidrug-binding pocket is primarily to attract and guide cationic drugs to the ""best available"" positions within the pocket that elicit QacR induction."
https://openalex.org/W1998850825,"Herpesviral entry is a highly elaborated process requiring many proteins to act in precise conjunction. Neutralizing antibodies interfere with this process to abrogate viral infection. Based on promoter transactivation of a reporter gene we established a novel method to quantify herpesvirus entry and neutralization by antibodies. Following infection with mouse and human cytomegalovirus and Herpes simplex virus 1 we observed promoter transactivation resulting in substantial luciferase expression (>1000-fold). No induction was elicited by UV-inactivated viruses. The response was MOI-dependent and immunoblots confirmed a correlation between luciferase induction and pp72-IE1 expression. Monoclonal antibodies, immune sera and purified immunoglobulin preparations decreased virus-dependent luciferase induction dose-dependently, qualifying this approach as surrogate virus neutralization test. Besides the reduced hands-on time, this assay allows analysis of herpesvirus entry in semi-permissive and non-adherent cells, which were previously non-assessable but play significant roles in herpesvirus pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1982398176,"Objective We examined the association between density of healthcare providers and patient outcomes using a large nationally representative cohort of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Uganda. Design We obtained data from The AIDS Support Organization (TASO) in Uganda. Patients 18 years of age and older who initiated cART at TASO between 2004 and 2008 contributed to this analysis. The number of healthcare providers per 100 patients, the number of patients lost to follow-up per 100 person years and number of deaths per 100 person years were calculated. Spearman correlation was used to identify associations between patient loss to follow-up and mortality with the healthcare provider-patient ratios. Results We found no significant associations between the number of patients lost to follow-up and physicians (p = 0.45), nurses (p = 0.93), clinical officers (p = 0.80), field officers (p = 0.56), and healthcare providers overall (p = 0.83). Similarly, no significant associations were observed between mortality and physicians (p = 0.65), nurses (p = 0.49), clinical officers (p = 0.73), field officers (p = 0.78), and healthcare providers overall (p = 0.73). Conclusions Patient outcomes, as measured by loss to follow-up and mortality, were not significantly associated with the number of doctors, nurses, clinical officers, field officers, or healthcare providers overall. This may suggest that that other factors, such as the presence of volunteer patient supporters or broader political or socioeconomic influences, may be more closely associated with outcomes of care among patients on cART in Uganda."
https://openalex.org/W2082929913,"The synthesis of inactive enzyme precursors, also known as “zymogens,” serves as a mechanism for regulating the execution of selected catalytic activities in a desirable time and/or site. Zymogens are usually activated by proteolytic cleavage. Many viruses encode proteases that execute key proteolytic steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we describe a proof of concept for a therapeutic approach to fighting viral infections through eradication of virally infected cells exclusively, thus limiting virus production and spread. Using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a model, we designed two HCV NS3 protease-activated “zymogenized” chimeric toxins (which we denote “zymoxins”). In these recombinant constructs, the bacterial and plant toxins diphtheria toxin A (DTA) and Ricin A chain (RTA), respectively, were fused to rationally designed inhibitor peptides/domains via an HCV NS3 protease-cleavable linker. The above toxins were then fused to the binding and translocation domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A in order to enable translocation into the mammalian cells cytoplasm. We show that these toxins exhibit NS3 cleavage dependent increase in enzymatic activity upon NS3 protease cleavage in vitro. Moreover, a higher level of cytotoxicity was observed when zymoxins were applied to NS3 expressing cells or to HCV infected cells, demonstrating a potential therapeutic window. The increase in toxin activity correlated with NS3 protease activity in the treated cells, thus the therapeutic window was larger in cells expressing recombinant NS3 than in HCV infected cells. This suggests that the “zymoxin” approach may be most appropriate for application to life-threatening acute infections where much higher levels of the activating protease would be expected."
https://openalex.org/W1990232141,"Mutagenic DNA repair (MDR) transiently increases mutation rate through the activation of low-fidelity repair polymerases in response to specific, DNA-damaging environmental stress conditions such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure. These repair polymerases also confer UVR tolerance, intimately linking mutability and survival in bacteria that colone habitats subject to regular UVR exposure.Here, we investigate adaptive specificity in experimental lineages of the highly UVR-mutable epiphytic plant pathogen Pseudomonas cichorii 302959. Relative fitness measurements of isolates and population samples from replicate lineages indicated that adaptive improvements emerged early in all lineages of our evolution experiment and specific increases in relative fitness correlated with distinct improvements in doubling and lag times. Adaptive improvements gained under UVR and non-UVR conditions were acquired preferentially, and differentially contributed to relative fitness under varied growth conditions.These results support our earlier observations that MDR activation may contribute to gains in relative fitness without impeding normal patterns of adaptive specificity in P. cichorii 302959."
