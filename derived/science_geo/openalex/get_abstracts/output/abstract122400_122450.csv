https://openalex.org/W2000125965,"The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) constitute a family of proteins, of which three members have so far been described. Using the expressed sequence tag sequencing approach, we have identified a novel TIMP-related cDNA fragment and subsequently cloned a fourth human TIMP (TIMP-4) from a human heart cDNA library. The open reading frame encodes a 224-amino acid precursor including a 29-residue secretion signal. The predicted structure of the new protein shares 37% sequence identity with TIMP-1 and 51% identity with TIMP-2 and −3. The protein has a predicted isoelectric point of 7.34. The open reading frame-directed expression of TIMP-4 protein in MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells showed metalloproteinase inhibitory activity on reverse zymography. By Northern analysis, only the adult heart showed abundant TIMP-4 transcripts with a 1.4-kilobase predominant transcript band; very low levels of the transcripts were detected in the kidney, placenta, colon, and testes, and no transcripts were detected in the liver, brain, lung, thymus, and spleen. This unique expression pattern suggests that TIMP-4 may function in a tissue-specific fashion in extracellular matrix homeostasis.

Controlled remodeling of the ECM is an essential aspect in the process of normal development, and deregulated remodeling has been indicated to have a role in the etiology of diseases such as arthritis, periodontal disease, and cancer metastasis (1Dochherty A.J.P.

The down-regulation of MMPs may occur at the levels of transcriptional regulation of the genes and activation of secreted proenzymes and through interaction with specific inhibitor proteins such as TIMPs. TIMPs are secreted multifunctional proteins that play pivotal roles in the regulation of ECM metabolism. Their most widely recognized action is as inhibitors of matrix MMPs. Thus, the net MMP activity in the ECM is the result of the balance between activated enzyme levels and TIMPs levels. Augmented MMP activity is associated with the metastatic phenotype of carcinomas, especially breast cancer (7Basset P. Wolf C. Rouyer N. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P.

These results suggest that an increase in the amount of TIMPs relative to MMPs could function to block tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In fact, tumor cell invasion and metastasis can be inhibited by up-regulation of TIMP expression or by an exogenous supply of TIMPs (17Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M.

The proteins are classified based on structural similarity to each other as well as their ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinases. There have been other reports of inhibitors of metalloproteases (IMPs) with characteristics different from these known TIMPs. In some cases these activities result from alternate forms of the known TIMPs. For instance, a report describes one IMP present in the conditioned media of human bladder carcinoma to be a partially glycosylated form of TIMP-1 and another to be a partially processed and degraded form of TIMP-2 (25Miyazaki K. Funahashi K. Numata Y. Koshikawa N. Akaogi K. Kikkawa Y. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are additional reports that describe sources and characteristics of IMP activity, but the gene products associated with these activities have not been delineated (26Apodaca G. Rutka J.T. Bouhana K. Berens M.E. Giblin J.R. Rosenblum M.L. McKerrow J.H. Banda M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2322-2329PubMed Google Scholar). Individual TIMP family members may have specific physiological roles. This notion is supported by several lines of evidence. First, although TIMPs are essentially interchangeable in their capabilities as inhibitors of MMPs, they are distinguished by the formation of specific complexes with different pro-MMPs (27Goldberg G.I. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. Wilhelm S. He C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8207-8211Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 28Kleiner D.E. Unsworth E.J. Krutzsch H.C.

J. 1992; 283: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Secreted MMP-2·TIMP-2 and MMP-9·TIMP-1 complexes may represent an additional function for TIMPs in controlling activation of specific latent MMPs. Unlike TIMP-1 and −2, TIMP-3 has a unique association with the ECM (30Leco K.J. Khokha R. Pavloff N. Hawkes S.P. Edwards D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9352-9360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the expression of TIMP genes is quite different. The TIMP-1 gene is highly inducible at the transcriptional level in response to many cytokines and hormones (31Lotz M. Guerne P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2017-2120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Mann J.S. Kindy M.S. Edwards D.R. Curry T.E.

Acta. 1992; 1171: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Likewise, TIMP-3 expression is not only induced in response to mitogenic stimulation but also is subject to cell cycle regulation (22Wick M. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that TIMP-3 expression may represent an invaluable tool for the analysis of cell cycle progression, terminal differentiation, and replicative senescence. In contrast, TIMP-2 expression, like that of MMP-2 with which it interacts, is largely constitutive (21Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Onisto M. Levy A.T. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13933-13938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Denhardt D.T. Feng B. Edwards D.R. Cocuzzi E.T. Malyankar U.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Since the introduction of the expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing approach, many novel human genes have been discovered and isolated (38Adams M.A. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Merril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F. Kerlavage A.R. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). With the rapidly growing repertoire of human ESTs, we took advantage of automated EST sequence analysis to identify novel TIMP-related genes. We describe here the full-length sequence of a novel member of the TIMP family, and we examined the expression of this new member, TIMP-4, in a variety of tissues. We have also demonstrated an MMP inhibitory activity of the expressed TIMP-4 protein. Restriction enzymes, T7 polymerase, a random primer DNA-labeling kit, and digoxigenin-labeled nucleotides were obtained from Boehringer Mannhem. [32P]dATP was purchased from Amersham Corp. We have used EST analysis to search for a new TIMP. A data base containing approximately 500,000 human partial cDNA sequences (expressed sequence tags) has been established in a collaborative effort between the Institute for Genomic Research and Human Genome Science, Inc., using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones (38Adams M.A. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Merril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F. Kerlavage A.R. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1651-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). Sequences of TIMP-related genes were searched for using the blastn and tblastn algorithms (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). An EST from a human brain library, which demonstrated homology to TIMPs, was completely sequenced and found to be a partial clone lacking the sequence at the 5′-end. The coding region and 3′-untranslated region of this clone were excised from the Bluescript vector by digestion with the restriction endonucleases EcoRI and XhoI and used to generate a radiolabeled probe. This probe was used to screen a Northern blot of total RNAs from several human tissues. The highest level of expression of the putative novel TIMP was noted in RNA from adult heart. We next generated a cDNA library from human heart. Poly(A) mRNA from heart tissue was obtained using Oligotex beads. Five micrograms of this mRNA were used to construct a directional cDNA library in the Stratagene Unizap vector using the Stratagene cDNA library kit. One million clones of the primary library were amplified, and an aliquot was excised to yield Bluescript SK plasmid clones. These clones were screened with the probe generated by EcoRI and XhoI digestion of the positive clone from a human brain library as described above. Positive clones were rescreened, both by hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analysis, using a Bluescript reverse primer and an antisense primer (5′-GACTGTCCACTTGGCACTTCT-3′) specific for the putative TIMP-related gene in the 3′-untranslated region. The full-length cDNA was completely sequenced using ABI 373a automated fluorescent sequencer protocols. Total RNA was extracted from tissues according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (45Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The RNA from human breast cancer cells was prepared using the RNAzol B RNA isolation kit (Tel-Test, Inc.) based on the manufacturer's instructions. Equal aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to a nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim). The membrane was prehybridized with ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech, Inc.) at 68°C for 30 min. The hybridization was carried out in the same solution with a 32P-labeled TIMP-4 probe (1.5 × 106 cpm/ml) for 1 h at 68°C. The membrane was then rinsed in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC constains 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) containing 0.05% SDS three times for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50°C. The full-length TIMP-4 cDNA was isolated from the Bluescript vector, following EcoRI and XhoI digestion, and used as a template for preparation of a random-labeled cDNA probe. The riboprobe is a 390-base segment extending from nucleotides 800-1,189 (the end of the 3′-end of the cDNA). This riboprobe, which covers 85% of the 3′-untranslated region, was generated by PstI digestion of the Bluscript vector, followed by RNA synthesis with T7 polymerase. The human TIMP-4 full-length sequence was subcloned into the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega) downstream of the human cytomegalovirus promoter to generate the pCITIMP4 expression vector. Forty micrograms of pCITIMP4 or the control pCI-neo plasmids were transfected into MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells by the calcium phosphate-mediated method as described previously (46Mcleskey S.W. Kurebayashi J. Honing S.F. Zweibel J.A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Kern F.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2168-2177PubMed Google Scholar). Thirty G418-resistant individual clones were selected in the selection medium containing 800 μg/ml G418, subcloned, and characterized by in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis. TIMP-4-producing clones were grown in serum-free defined medium. The conditioned media were collected at 40 h after culturing cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, concentrated approximately 10-fold using an Amicon hollow fiber concentrator with a Mr 10,000 cutoff. The inhibitory activity was subsequently analyzed on reverse zymography SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples of conditioned media from TIMP-4 -producing clones and control clones were adjusted to the same protein concentration and electrophoresed on a 0.1% SDS, 12% polyacrylamide protease substrate gel (47Staskus P.W. Masiarz F.R. Pallanck L.J. Hawkes S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 449-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was incubated in collagenase buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.7 μg/ml of recombinant MMP2) at 37°C overnight to allow digestion of gelatin in the gel. The MMP inhibitory activities of samples were visualized by Commassie Blue R-250 (Sigma) staining and destaining as described previously (48Azzam H.S. Arand G. Lippman M.E. Thompson E.W. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1758-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We have searched a data base of human genes identified by the EST method. The automated screening revealed an EST from a human brain library with a 45% sequence homology to the TIMP-2 protein. The clone was completely sequenced. A putative stop codon was located; however, a start codon (ATG) could not be located at the 5′-end. The length of the open reading frame was also shorter than expected for a 22-28-kDa protein in the TIMP family. Therefore, it was concluded that this cDNA clone did not encode the entire putative TIMP protein, and that a segment at the 5′-end containing the start codon was missing. To obtain the full-length sequence of the putative new TIMP gene, the identified cDNA clone was prepared as a probe and was used to investigate the expression of this new putative TIMP gene in a variety of human tissues by Northern blot analysis. Because the highest expression of this new putative TIMP gene was identified in human heart, we next generated a cDNA phage library from a human adult heart and screened 1 million clones for an additional 5′-sequence. As a result, a number of clones were identified, and the longest of these was sequenced and found to contain the full-length cDNA sequence of the putative new TIMP gene. The nucleotide sequence determined from this clone and the predicted corresponding amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. The full-length cDNA sequence contains 1,189 bp with a 672-bp open reading frame: 59 bp in the 5′-untranslated region and 458 bp of a 3′-untranslated sequence. The open reading frame extends from the initiation A60TG codon to TAG732 stop. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 224 amino acids. A hydrophobic leader sequence at the amino terminus conforms to a consensus signal peptide with a predicted cleavage site following an alanine residue located at position 29 in the precursor (Fig. 1). Removal of the signal sequence results in a mature protein of 195 amino acids, having a calculated molecular mass of 22 kDa, which is in close agreement with the molecular mass range of the TIMP family. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a protein with an isoelectric point of 7.34. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence with the sequences of human TIMP-related proteins is shown in Fig. 2. After optimal alignment, the putative protein shows 37% sequence identity and 57% similarity to TIMP-1 and 51% identity and 70% similarity to TIMP-2 and −3. These calculations do not take into account the significance of any gaps in the alignments. The predicted protein structure of the putative new protein shares several essential features that are characteristic of the TIMP family, including 12 completely conserved cysteine residues in the corresponding positions that form intrachain disulfide bonds that fold the protein into a two domain structure (49Williamson R.A. Marston F.A. Angal S. Koklitis P. Panico M. Morris H.R. Carne A.F. Smith B.J. Harris T.J. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The presence of a consensus sequence, VIRAK, which has been proposed to serve a hallmark of the TIMP family (36Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 50Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar), was also observed in the most conserved first 22 amino acids located at the amino-terminal region.Fig. 2Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of human TIMP-4 with human TIMP-1-TIMP-3. The available amino acid sequence of TIMP-1 (accession number P01033), TIMP-2 (accession number P16035), and TIMP-3 (accession number P35625) were obtained from the SwissProt data base and aligned with the TIMP-4 deduced sequence using the clustal method of the MegAlign program from the DNASTAR software package. Conserved bases are boxed; the 29-amino acid putative signal sequence is shown between two triangles (▵), and the 12 conserved cysteine residues are labeled with arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The extensive similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence with TIMPs suggests that the putative new protein is a novel member of the human TIMP family and should be designated human TIMP-4. Tissue-specific transcription of TIMP-4 was examined by Northern blotting on 20 μg of total RNAs from various human adult tissues (Fig. 3). As expected, the Northern blot showed maximal TIMP-4 transcript levels in the heart. Using a full-length cDNA hybridization probe, transcripts of 4.1, 2.1, 1.4, 1.2, and 0.97 kb were detected in heart, with the 1.4-kb band representing at least 90% of the hybridization signal. Similar bands, with much lesser accumulations in their relative intensity, were also obtained in the kidney, pancreas, colon, and testes. By contrast, none of them was present in other specimens analyzed, such as the liver, brain, lung, small intestine, thymus, and spleen. The 1.4-kb TIMP-4 transcript was also detected in RNA isolated from the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 4). To rule out the possibility of cross-hybridization with TIMP-1-TIMP-3, an additional filter with RNA from MDA-MB-231 cells was also hybridized with a 389-bp riboprobe, which represents a specific nucleotide sequence of the 3′-untranslated TIMP-4. As shown in Fig. 4B, the riboprobe recognized the same bands in the RNA from MDA-MB-231 cells as the complete DNA probe, thus suggesting that the 1.4-kb transcript corresponds to TIMP-4.Fig. 4Northern analysis of TIMP-4 expression in human breast cancer cells. RNAs were isolated and subjected to Northern analysis by hybridization with either a full-length cDNA probe (A) or a 390-base riboprobe, which represents a specific nucleotide sequence of the 3′-untranslated TIMP-4 (C). The integrity of the RNA was ascertained by hybridization with a housekeeping gene, 36B4 (B). Each lane contained 20 μg of total RNA. Northern analysis failed to detect the TIMP-4 transcript in most breast cancer cell lines, except MDA-MB-231 cells, which showed a strong 1.4-kb TIMP-4 transcript; a very weak hybridization signal was also detected in MDA-MB-436 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Active recombinant TIMP-4 protein is required for characterization of its biochemical activity against MMPs and biological functions to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. As an initial attempt to evaluate the biological significance of TIMP-4 to inhibit cancer growth and metastasis, we have transfected the TIMP-4 full-length cDNA into the highly tumorigenic MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells. Three positive clones have been selected and expressed high levels of the TIMP-4 transcript (Fig. 5A). Conditioned media from two TIMP-4-positive clone and one control clone were collected, concentrated, and analyzed for metalloproteinase inhibitory activity by reverse zymography. Fig. 5B shows that the conditioned media from TIMP-4-producing clones contained a prominent MMP inhibitory activity at the 22-kDa band in a nonreducing gelatin-containing SDS gel. In contrast, no such activity was observed in the conditioned medium form control MDA-MB-435 cells, suggesting that no endogenous TIMP activities were detectable in the same conditions for detection of recombinant TIMP-4 activity. The work described here introduces a new member of the TIMP family, to which we confer the title TIMP-4 because of its high sequence homology to the TIMP family, 12 conserved cysteine residues, and the expressed MMP inhibitory activity. The classic approach to identifying novel proteins begins with the discovery of an interesting biological activity. This protein is then purified and biochemically characterized, and subsequently, the gene is cloned. Since the introduction of the EST sequencing approach and the availability of tens of thousands of ESTs, researchers can now shift their attention to high throughput cDNA cloning in conjunction with structural similarity analysis as an accelerated method of protein discovery. In this regard, the nucleic acid sequences of randomly picked cDNAs from established EST data bases are searched and analyzed by the BLAST program for sequence similarity to the protein of interest. Where similarities are detected, it is possible to make functional inferences concerning the encoded protein based on what is known about the function of the matched sequences. Using this approach, we identified an EST with high sequence homology to TIMP-2 and, subsequently, the novel TIMP-4 gene was cloned using this EST as a probe. The predicted protein structure of TIMP-4 shows several interesting features. First, as expected, essential features of other TIMPs are conserved, including the location of 12 Cys residues, as well as their relative spacing and the presence of a 29-amino acid leader sequence, which presumably is cleaved to produce the mature protein (13Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Second, the mature protein has an expected size of 22 kDa, which is similar to the sizes of TIMP proteins. Expressed rTIMP-4 protein migrates as a 24-kDa protein by reverse zymography SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at nonreducing conditions, which is consistent with that obtained for other TIMPs (25Miyazaki K. Funahashi K. Numata Y. Koshikawa N. Akaogi K. Kikkawa Y. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14387-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the deduced amino acid sequence of TIMP-4 predicts a protein with an isoelectric point of 7.34, the most neutral human TIMP protein at the physiological condition (pH 7.4) comparing with values of 8.00, 6.45, and 9.04 for human TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and TIMP-3, respectively (24Wilde C.G. Hawkins P.R. Coleman R.T. Levine W.B. Delegeane A.M. Okamoto P.M Ito L.Y. Scott R.W. Seilhamer J.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fourth, as expected, TIMP-4 has a highly conserved amino-terminal domain similar to other TIMPs. The amino-terminal 126 amino acid residues of mature TIMP-1 (51Murphy G. Houbrechts A. Cockett M.I. Williamson R.A. O'Shea M. Docherty A.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8097-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and the amino-terminal 127 residues of mature TIMP-2 (52Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.P. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 35DeClerck Y.A. Darville M.I. Yean T.D. Lee Y. Tomich J.M. Langley K.E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) have been shown to be adequate for the inhibition of MMPs, suggesting that this part of the proteins is functionally critical for inhibition of MMPs. In this region, the first 22 amino acids of the mature proteins is the most conserved among the TIMPs; 16 of the first 22 amino acids (73%) are identical among human TIMP-1-TIMP-3. However, the first 22 amino acids of mature TIMP-4 show a decreased sequence identity with other TIMPs: 63% identical to TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 and 59% identical to TIMP-3. The consensus sequence CXCXPXHPQXAFCNXDXVIRAK (single amino acid code; X, any amino acid) has been proposed to serve a diagnostic hallmark of the TIMPs being present in TIMP-1-TIMP-3 (36Apte S.S. Olsen B.R. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14313-14318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because TIMP-4 has a less conserved sequence in this region, with only 12 of 22 amino acids identical in all four TIMPs, we suggest the use of consensus sequence VIRAK (positions 47-51; Fig. 2) as a diagnostic hallmark of the TIMP family. We have shown that TIMP-4 is more homologous to TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 than to TIMP-1. Tissue expression of TIMP-4 appears limited. Although large amounts of transcript were detected in the heart, much lower levels of expression were detected in the kidney, pancreas, colon, and testes; no TIMP-4 transcripts were detected in other tissues, such as liver, brain, lung, thymus, small intestine, and spleen. TIMP-4 may function in a tissue-specific fashion as part of an acute response to tissue remodeling. It is interesting to note that the highest level of TIMP-4 expression is seen in the heart, in which human cancer metastasis rarely occurs. The possibility that the high expression of TIMP-4 in the heart may contribute the inability of malignant cells to invade needs further consideration. We have expressed TIMP-4 in MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells in an effort to investigate the biological significance of this new TIMP in tumor growth and metastasis. Since TIMPs block the activities of MMPs, the net inhibitory activity of TIMPs might be important in preventing malignant progression from the benign to the metastatic phenotype. In fact, tumor cell invasion and metastasis can be blocked by up-regulation of TIMP expression or an exogenous supply of TIMPs (17Khokha R. Waterhouse P. Yagel S. Lala P.K. Overall C.M. Norton G.

Alternatively, down-regulation of TIMP-1 and −2 has been reported to contribute significantly to the invasive potential of human glioblastoma (19Mohanam S. Wang S.W. Rayford A. Yamamoto M. Sawaya R.

We have analyzed the MMP inhibitory activities of the expressed rTIMP-4 from the conditioned media of transfected clones. As expected, rTIMP-4 proteins expressed from human breast cancer cells possess an inhibitory activity against MMP and are secreted extracellularly, thus confirming that the novel protein is a new member of the TIMP family. In summary, we have cloned and sequenced a novel human TIMP gene designated TIMP-4, the expression of which is tissue-specific. We have also presented evidence indicating the MMP inhibitory activity of the expressed TIMP-4 protein. We thank Dr. W. G. Stetler-Stevenson for providing rMMP-2, Drs. Amy Sang and Robert Bienkowski for discussion on the manuscript, and Jane Shirreffs for reading the manuscript."

Although the mature protein has yet to be identified, the deduced amino acid sequence of the mac25 propeptide shows an overall 40-45% similarity and 20-25% identity to IGFBPs. Furthermore, mac25 contains the common IGFBP motif (GCGCCXXC) at the NH2 terminus, in a region containing a cluster of 12 conserved cysteines, of which 11 are found in mac25, suggesting that mac25 is another member of the IGFBP family. In this study, we describe the successful expression of recombinant human mac25, using a baculovirus system, and demonstrate that the 27-kDa mac25 protein specifically binds IGFs, thereby meeting criteria necessary for renaming it IGFBP-7. Recombinant human IGF-I was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), and recombinant human IGF-II was provided by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Recombinant human IGFBP-3E. coli, a non-glycosylated 29-kDa core protein which was expressed in E. coli, was a generous gift from Celtrix (Santa Clara, CA). Highly specific rabbit polyclonal antibody, αIGFBP-3g1, was raised in our laboratory against glycosylated IGFBP-3 (9Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [Gln6,Ala7,Tyr18,Leu19,Leu27]IGF-II ([QAYLL]IGF-II), a synthetic IGF-II analog, was synthesized as described previously (15Oh Y. Muller H.L. Zhang H. Ling N. Rosenfeld R.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 343: 41-54Crossref Google Scholar). Iodination was performed by a modification of the chloramine-T technique, to a specific activity of 350-500 μCi/μg for IGF-I and IGF-II and 100 μCi/μg for IGFBP-3E. coli peptides (10Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Initially, a partial cDNA fragment was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using RNA isolated from the human breast cancer cell line Hs578T as described previously (16Nagalla S.R. Barry J.B. Creswich C.K. Eden P. Taylor T.R. Spindel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6205-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The primers used for amplification were 5′-primer TGCGAGCAAGGTCCTTCCAT and 3′-primer CACCAGGCAGGAGTTCTGTC (corresponding to nucleotides 479-498 and 628-647 of L198182, GenBank™ sequence). The partial cDNA was subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and confirmed by sequencing. An expression cDNA library prepared in ZapExpress (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with Hs578T mRNA was screened with the partial cDNA fragment, as described previously (16Nagalla S.R. Barry J.B. Creswich C.K. Eden P. Taylor T.R. Spindel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6205-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and full-length clones were isolated. Full-length sequence was identical to the published mac25 sequence (13Murphy M. Pykett M.J. Harnish P. Zang K.D. George D.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 715-722PubMed Google Scholar). To express recombinant protein, a FLAG epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) was added at the COOH terminus by use of polymerase chain reaction. Primers (A) 5′-GGCCATTCAGACCCGGGGTGG (661-682) and (B) 5′-GCCGCCCTCGAGCTACTTCTACTGCTGCTTGTAGTCCCTTTTTTCACTGGCTAT (827-844), which was designed with the FLAG sequence followed by a stop codon and a restriction site for XhoI, were used, and the resulting polymerase chain reaction product was digested with SmaI and XhoI restriction enzymes and ligated into full-length cDNA digested with the above enzymes, to replace the COOH terminus. After sequencing, the FLAG-tagged mac25 cDNA was subcloned into baculovirus expression vector pFASTBAC1 (Life Technologies, Inc.). mac25-pFASTBAC1 construct was transfected into Sf9 insect cells and positive viral recombinants were isolated, using the vendor's protocols. Western immunoblots were performed with the FLAG sequence specific anti-M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak). Large scale protein purification was begun by infecting 108 HI-5 insect cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 at 27°C for 3 days. The media from the infected cells were collected and concentrated, and the resultants were bound to an anti-M2 antibody affinity column overnight at 4°C. The column was washed three times with 5 ml of HBS (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl), and the protein was eluted with four 1-ml washes with HBS containing FLAG peptide, 0.5 μg/μl. The purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 12% gel (10Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and stained with Coomasie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunodetection. Eluted fractions from an anti-M2 antibody affinity column were pooled, concentrated, and quantitated by comparison with known amounts of IGFBP-3E. coli after silver staining. The NH2-terminal sequence of mac25 (10 μg) was determined (Biotechnology Laboratory in the Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon) by Edman degradation using a 470A gas-phase protein Sequencer equipped with a 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). FLAG-tagged-mac25 and IGFBP-3E. coli were incubated with 125I-IGF-I or -IGF-II (50,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of unlabeled peptides at the concentrations indicated in the text and figures, overnight at 4°C. After cross-linking with disuccinimidyl suberate, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and radioautography (10Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were quantified by densitometry using the area under the curve, as calculated by an LKB densitometer. Unreduced samples of FLAG-tagged-mac25 and IGFBP-3E. coli were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters, which were incubated overnight with 1.5 × 106 cpm of 125I-IGF-I or -IGF-II, washed, dried, and exposed to film. Similarly, WLB were prepared by nondenaturing PAGE, i.e. without SDS, in stacking (pH 7.4) or resolving (pH 8.8) gels (17Hunes B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis Protein: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, New York1990Google Scholar) for assessment of IGF binding. Proteins were deglycosylated with endoglycosidase F (Endo F) (9Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a positive control, acid-chromatographed normal human serum IGFBP fractions were prepared (18Gargosky S.E. Pham H.P. Wilson K.F. Liu F. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), with an IGFBP-3 concentration of 3.5 ng/μl, assessed by IGFBP-3 radioimmunoassay (18Gargosky S.E. Pham H.P. Wilson K.F. Liu F. Giudice L.C. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Forty ng of FLAG-tagged mac25 and 2 μl of acid-chromatographed normal human serum IGFBP fraction, containing 7 ng of glycosylated IGFBP-3, were treated with 120-480 milliunits of Endo F as described previously (9Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent Western immunoblots or ligand blots were performed as described above. Blots of 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from normal human tissues, that had been subjected to electrophoresis in 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel before transfer to nylon membranes, were purchased (Clontech). Total RNA from a variety of normal and cancer cell lines was isolated by standard methods, using guanidine thiocyanate (16Nagalla S.R. Barry J.B. Creswich C.K. Eden P. Taylor T.R. Spindel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6205-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled antisense cRNA probes for mac25, transcribed from the plasmid constructs, were used. Blots were hybridized and washed at high stringency as described previously (16Nagalla S.R. Barry J.B. Creswich C.K. Eden P. Taylor T.R. Spindel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6205-6209Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A is an immunoblot of the fractions collected during purification of FLAG-tagged mac25, and the purified concentrated protein on nonreducing 12% SDS-PAGE. The major antibody-specific protein is 27 kDa, with a minor higher molecular weight antibody-specific protein of ∼54 kDa (presumably dimers of the mac25 protein). Analysis of the purified recombinant human (rh)-mac25 protein on a nonreducing 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining (Fig. 1B), show a protein of approximately 99% purity and a molecular weight of 27,000. The NH2-terminal sequence of the purified rh-mac25 was SSSDTCGPCE, indicating that human mac25 contains 26 residues of signal peptide sequence and 251 amino acids of the mature protein, which is 18-22% identical to other mature IGFBPs (most identical to IGFBP-3). Since the deduced amino acid sequence analysis revealed that mac25 contains one potential N-glycosylation site located at amino acid 171 (Asn-Val-Thr), we treated mac25 with various concentrations of Endo F (120-480 milliunits) to cleave the N-glycosylated carbohydrates. As shown in Fig. 2A, the size of mac25 was reduced to approximately 25 kDa following treatment with 480 milliunits of Endo-F, indicating that the secreted rh-mac25 is a glycosylated protein with 2 kDa of N-linked sugars and a 25-kDa core. Parallel treatment of human serum IGFBP-3 with Endo F reduced the 41- and 39-kDa glycosylated species to a 29-kDa core protein (Fig. 2B). To test whether mac25 is capable of binding to IGF peptides, we performed WLB and IGF affinity cross-linking. As shown in Fig. 3A, when we employed WLB under denaturing conditions with 125I-IGF-I (upper panel) or 125I-IGF-II (lower panel), rh-mac25 was not detected, at concentrations of rh-mac25 ranging from 1.5 to 150 nM, although 5 nM rhIGFBP-3E. coli was detected as a 29-kDa band with either 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II. However, when rh-mac25 was electrophoresed by nondenaturing PAGE, rh-mac25 was faintly detected at a concentration of 30 nM and clearly identified at 300 nM (Fig. 3B). Alternatively, when affinity cross-linking, another method for testing binding ability, was performed with 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II and concentrations of rh-mac25 similar to those used in WLB, an approximately 34-kDa band was detected on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating the 27-kDa rh-mac25 bound to 7-kDa 125I-IGF-I (Fig. 3C, upper panel) or 125I-IGF-II (Fig. 3C, lower panel, and D). Binding of rh-mac25 to IGFs is readily detectable by affinity cross-linking at a mac25 concentration as low as 2 nM. Furthermore, the data indicate that rh-mac25 binding to IGFs is specific, as shown by competition with unlabeled IGF-I and IGF-II, but not with [QAYLL]IGF-II, which has approximately 100-fold less affinity for IGFBPs. We estimated that the affinity of rh-mac25 is at least 5-6-fold lower for IGF-I and 20-25-fold lower for IGF-II than those of rhIGFBP-3E. coli (shown as an approximately 36-kDa band), after determining band densities by densitometer. We next investigated the distribution of IGFBP-7 in normal human tissues and human cancer cells, using Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, the 1.1-kilobase IGFBP-7 mRNA was detected in a broad spectrum of normal tissues. In particular, high expression of IGFBP-7 was observed in small intestine, colon, ovary, prostate, testes, spleen, heart, kidney, and pancreas. Interestingly, expression of IGFBP-7 mRNA was reduced in ER-positive breast cancer and cancer cells from prostate, colon, and lung, although ER-negative breast cancer cells and glioblastoma cells showed relatively high expression (Fig. 4B). IGFBPs bind to IGF peptides with high affinity, ranging from 10−11 to 10−9 M and regulate the biological activities of the IGFs. Amino acid sequence analysis has revealed that relatively high similarity (50-60%) exists among human IGFBPs (1Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 3: 243-266Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The most striking feature is a cluster of 18 conserved cysteines found in all IGFBPs except IGFBP-6, which contains 16. Twelve are in the NH2-terminal one-third of the molecule (10 in IGFBP-6) and the remaining six are in the COOH-terminal third of the protein. These terminal regions are highly homologous among the IGFBPs and are speculated to contribute to binding of IGFs. In regard to this sequence homology and striking conservation of cysteines among the IGFBPs, mac25 meets structural criteria as a new member of the IGFBP family by the fact that mac25 contains critical conserved sequences, including the IGFBP motif (GCGCCXXC) in the NH2 terminus, as well as 11 conserved cysteines in the NH2 terminus and, possibly, 1 at the COOH terminus. Indeed, our affinity cross-linking data showed that mac25 specifically binds IGF-I and IGF-II, indicating that mac25 is a bona fide IGFBP, and can be properly called IGFBP-7. Specificity of the IGFBP-7 binding to IGF was further demonstrated by the relatively low affinity for [QAYLL]IGF-II, an IGF-II analog whose affinity for IGFBPs is 100-fold less than that of native IGF-II. Compared with IGFBP-3, the affinity of IGFBP-7 for IGFs was assessed by competitive affinity cross-linking to be 5-25-fold lower, which might be attributed to a lack of conserved sequences at the COOH terminus, particularly of the 6 cysteines, of which only one may be conserved. The COOH terminus of the IGFBPs clearly contributes to the structural configuration required for IGF binding and may even be capable of independent binding of IGF peptides. 2Y. Oh, S. R. Nagalla, Y. Yamanaka, H.-S. Kim, E. Wilson, and R. G. Rosenfeld, unpublished data. The failure to demonstrate IGFBP-7 binding of IGF by conventional Western ligand blotting methods may be attributable to the loss of structural integrity under denaturing conditions, since binding was observed when blotting was performed with non-denaturing gels. Alternatively, the affinity of IGFBP-7 for IGF peptides may be overestimated by cross-linking and may, in fact, be 2 or even 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of IGFBP-3. Similar problems have been observed in studies of proteolytic fragments of IGFBP-3, which bind poorly by Western ligand blot, but are readily identified by cross-linking (19Giudice L.C. Farrell E.M. Pham H. Lamson G.L. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 71: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, even if the affinity of IGFBP-7 proves to be 100-fold lower than that of IGFBP-3, it would still be in a range capable of modulating the interaction of IGFs with their receptors, as is the case with other IGFBPs. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that IGFBP-3, the major IGFBP species in the circulation, has a novel growth inhibitory action mediated through its own receptor (IGF-independent action), in addition to regulating IGF access to IGF receptors (IGF-dependent action) in human breast cancer cells (9Oh Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transcriptional regulation of IGFBP-3 expression provides a mechanism for both TGF-β2 and all-trans-retinoic acid (all-trans-RA) inhibition of breast cancer cell growth (11Oh Y.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1545-1550PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have reported that expression of mac25 mRNA was elevated in senescent human mammary epithelial cells, while apparently down-regulated in mammary carcinoma cell lines (13Murphy M. Pykett M.J. Harnish P. Zang K.D. George D.L. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 715-722PubMed Google Scholar, 14Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Moreover, mac25 mRNA was up-regulated in normal, growing mammary epithelial cells by all-trans-RA, suggesting that mac25 may be a downstream effector of the RA-induced senescence pathway (14Swisshelm K. Ryan K. Tsuchiya K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Taken together with our data showing reduced levels of mac25 (IGFBP-7) mRNA in cancer cells from breast, prostate, colon and lung, it is tempting to speculate that mac25 (IGFBP-7) functions not only as an IGF binding protein, but also as a direct growth-suppressing factor, with an IGF-independent action similar to that of IGFBP-3 (9Oh Y. Muller H.L. Lamson G. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14964-14971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Oh Y. Muller H.L. Pham H.M. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol.

Additionally, we propose that IGFBPs 1-7 will prove to be members of a superfamily of growth-regulating factors that share structural and sequence homology and which may modulate growth by IGF-dependent and/or IGF-independent mechanisms. Further assessment of IGF binding affinity and the mechanism(s) for the growth-suppressing actions of IGFBP-7 is currently underway."
https://openalex.org/W1988176512,"Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) is involved in the biosynthesis of many peptide hormones and neurotransmitters. Mice with the fat mutation have previously been found to have a point mutation in the cpe gene, and to have greatly reduced levels of CPE-like enzyme activity in the pituitary and pancreatic islets (Naggert, J. K., Fricker, L. D., Varlamov, O., Nishina, P. M., Rouille, Y., Steiner, D. F., Carroll, R. J., Paigen, B. J., and Leiter, E. H. (1995) Nat. Genet. 10, 135-142). In the present report, we examined CPE-like activity and peptide processing in several tissues of C57BLKS/LtJ-Cpefat/Cpefat mutant (Cpefat/Cpefat) mice. Whereas CPE-like activity is detected in homogenates of Cpefat/Cpefat mouse tissues, the majority of this activity is not due to CPE based on the sensitivity to p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate. In addition, the Cpefat/Cpefat activity does not bind to a substrate affinity column under conditions that bind CPE. Furthermore, the enzyme activity and immunoreactive properties of the activity purified from Cpefat/Cpefat brain are distinct from those of CPE. Taken together, these data suggest that CPE is completely inactive in the Cpefat/Cpefat mice, and that all of the CPE-like activity is due to other carboxypeptidases such as carboxypeptidase D. Levels of Leu-enkephalin in Cpefat/Cpefat mouse brain are approximately 5-fold lower than those in control brain. Treatment of the Cpefat/Cpefat brain extract with carboxypeptidase B restores the level of Leu-enkephalin to the level in control brain. Interestingly, the large molecular weight enkephalin-containing peptides are elevated 2-3-fold in Cpefat/Cpefat mouse brain. These data indicate that CPE plays an important role in the processing of peptide hormones in various tissues, but that other carboxypeptidases also contribute to peptide processing. Furthermore, the increase in levels of high molecular weight enkephalin peptides in the Cpefat/Cpefat mouse suggests that CPE is required for efficient peptide processing by the endopeptidases."

LTP was not associated with any change in the total activity of PKA, consistent with activation by cyclic AMP, as opposed to an increase in the amount or efficacy of the enzyme. The LTP-associated activation of PKA required stimulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, and bath application of NMDA was sufficient to activate PKA.

https://openalex.org/W1975439918,"The superoxide (O2·¯)-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes is a multicomponent complex consisting of a membrane-associated flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), bearing the NADPH binding site and two redox centers (FAD and heme) and three cytosolic activating components: p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2). The canonical view is that the induction of O2·¯ generation involves the stimulus-dependent assembly of all three cytosolic components with cytochrome b559, a process mimicked in vitro by a cell-free system activated by anionic amphiphiles. We studied the requirement for individual cytosolic components in the activation of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system consisting of purified and relipidated cytochrome b559, recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1, and the amphiphile, lithium dodecyl sulfate. We found that pronounced activation of NADPH oxidase can be achieved by exposing cytochrome b559 to p67phox and Rac1, in the total absence of p47phox (turnover = 60 mol O2·¯/s/mol cytochrome b559). However, maximal activation (turnover = 153 mol O2·¯/s/mol cytochrome b559) could only be obtained in the presence of p47phox. O2·¯ production, in the absence of p47phox, was dependent on: high molar ratios of p67phox and Rac1 to cytochrome b559, Rac1 being in the GTP-bound form, cytochrome b559 being saturated with FAD, and an optimal concentration of amphiphile. Single cytosolic components or combinations of two cytosolic components, other than p67phox and Rac1, were incapable of activation. We conclude that p67phox and Rac1 are the only cytosolic components directly involved in the induction of electron transport in cytochrome b559. p47phox appears to facilitate or stabilize the interaction of p67phox and, possibly, Rac1 with cytochrome b559, and is required for optimal generation of O2·¯ under physiological conditions.

INTRODUCTIONThe production of oxygen radicals, in response to triggering of cell-surface receptors, is the paramount microbicidal mechanism of phagocytic cells. The primary reaction in this process is the generation of superoxide (O2·¯), 1The abbreviations used are: O2·¯superoxideGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateLiDSlithium dodecyl sulfateCGDchronic granulomatous disease. derived by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, catalyzed by a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), utilizing NADPH as the source of electrons (reviewed in 1Rotrosen D.

Electron flow from NADPH to oxygen is activated consequent to the interaction of cytochrome b559 with three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2), leading to the formation of a multimolecular structure, known as the NADPH oxidase complex (reviewed in 4McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The elicitation of an oxidative burst in intact phagocytes is accompanied by the translocation to the plasma membrane of about 10% of p47phox and p67phox (5Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Translocation of p47phox to the membrane is linked to the phosphorylation of the component at multiple sites (6Okamura N. Curnutte J.T. Roberts R.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, movement of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane requires the presence of cytochrome b559 (7Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is of interest that membrane localization of p67phox is dependent on p47phox (7Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one of the functions of p47phox is to escort p67phox to the membrane. Whether activation or an oxidative burst is associated with translocation of Rac to the membrane is still controversial (8Quinn M.T. Evans T. Loetterle L.R. Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Google Scholar). Of special relevance to the subject of the present communication is the finding that, in preparations obtained from both resting and stimulated leukocytes, p47phox is detected in the soluble fraction, whereas p67phox is associated with the cytoskeleton, which is also the site of O2·¯ production (11Woodman R.C. Ruedi J.M. Jesaitis A.J. Okamura N. Quinn M.T. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Google Scholar).The activation of NADPH oxidase can be mimicked in vitro by a cell-free system consisting, in its most basic form, of membranes and the cytosolic fraction of resting phagocytes exposed to a critical concentration of some anionic amphiphiles (12Bromberg Y. Pick E. Cell. Immunol. 1984; 88: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 13Heyneman R.A. Vercauteren R.E. J.

Chem. 1985; 260: 13539-13545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete reconstitution of a functioning NADPH oxidase can be achieved in cell-free systems consisting exclusively of highly purified or recombinant components (17Rotrosen D. Yeung C.L. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Kwong C.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1459-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 18Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol.

The most commonly utilized version of this is the semi-recombinant system, consisting of purified relipidated and reflavinated cytochrome b559 combined with recombinant p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (18Abo A. Boyhan A. West I. Thrasher A.J. Segal A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16767-16770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is commonly accepted that the cell-free system contains all the basic components necessary for NADPH-dependent O2·¯ generation, but is lacking at least one cytosolic component, probably active in the intact cell (p40phox) (20Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and all signal transduction and regulatory elements. Experimental evidence has, so far, supported the canonical view that NADPH oxidase activation in the cell-free system is an “all or none” phenomenon, in the sense that all three cytosolic components, in rigorous molar proportions, are required for the activation of electron flow across the redox centers of cytochrome b559. In spite of recent advances in our understanding of the nature of protein-protein interactions among components, leading to the assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex (reviewed in 4McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of the ensuing activation of electron transport in cytochrome b559 remains obscure.Three pieces of evidence suggest that not all cytosolic components are directly involved in the “activation” of cytochrome b559 or that individual components might have distinctive roles in this process. First, O2·¯ production could be induced in solubilized membranes (21Bellavite P. Corso F. Dusi S. Grzeskowiak M. Della-Bianca V. Rossi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8210-8214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purified and relipidated cytochrome b559 (22Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Koshkin V. Pick E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by phosphatidic acid, in the absence of cytosolic components. Second, the finding (11Woodman R.C. Ruedi J.M. Jesaitis A.J. Okamura N. Quinn M.T. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Google Scholar) that p47phox was absent from the cytoskeletal fraction of activated neutrophils, which contained the bulk of O2·¯ forming activity, was difficult to reconcile with the concept that p47phox is more than a transient constituent of the NADPH oxidase complex. Finally, Cross et al. (24Cross A.R. Yarchover J.L. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21448-21454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the activated NADPH oxidase possessed a diaphorase activity, which was dependent on p67phox but not on p47phox. They went on to show that the two cytosolic components have unequal roles in the regulation of electron flow in cytochrome b559; p67phox stimulated the flow from NADPH to FAD, whereas p47phox was required for electron transport from FAD to heme and oxygen (25Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The subject of this paper is the finding that purified relipidated and reflavinated cytochrome b559 generates high amounts of O2·¯ when combined in vitro with p67phox, Rac1, and an anionic amphiphile, in the total absence of p47phox.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe found that O2·¯ was generated by a cell-free system consisting of purified and relipidated cytochrome b559, p67phox, and Rac1 in the GTPγS-bound form, activated by the anionic amphiphile, LiDS. The remarkable feature of this form of NADPH oxidase activation is that it occurs in the total absence of the cytosolic component, p47phox. Fig. 1 illustrates a characteristic experiment, in which O2·¯ production by the complete cell-free system, consisting of cytochrome b559 combined with all three cytosolic components (trace 1), was compared with that proceeding in the absence of p47phox (trace 2), Rac1 (trace 3), p67phox (trace 4), or both p47phox and Rac1 (trace 5). It is evident that the combination of cytosolic components p67phox and Rac1-GTPγS is both necessary and sufficient for the activation of electron transport in cytochrome b559 from NADPH to oxygen, leading to the production of O2·¯, although the presence of p47phox was required for maximal O2·¯ production. The process was dependent on: the presence of NADPH (a Km for NADPH of 40 μM was found), saturation of cytochrome b559 with FAD (a 3-fold molar excess of FAD was present in the activation mixture), and an optimal concentration of LiDS. Heat denaturation of either p67phox or Rac1 (95°C, 3 min) resulted in a total loss of NADPH oxidase activating ability. Recombinant Rac1 not subjected to exchange to GTPγS was also inactive. The simultaneous presence of p67phox and Rac1 during coincubation with cytochrome b559, in the presence of LiDS, was an absolute requirement for activation; none of the two components was active by itself and exposure of cytochrome b559 to only one component during the 3-min incubation in 50 μl, followed by the addition of the second component together with the 0.95 ml of assay buffer, did not lead to O2·¯ generation. Neither any of the three cytosolic components added alone nor combinations of two cytosolic components, other than p67phox and Rac1, at molar ratios in relation to cytochrome b559 of up to 40:1, were capable of NADPH oxidase activation.As seen in Table I, turnover rates reaching 40% of those obtained in the complete cell-free system, were achieved by activation of cytochrome b559 with the combination of p67phox and Rac1, whereas single cytosolic components or all other combinations of two cytosolic components elicited turnover rates of less than 1.9% of those measured in the complete system. Fig. 2 illustrates the dose-response dependence of O2·¯ production, in the p47phox-deficient cell-free system, on the concentration of p67phox (A) and Rac1 (B) in the presence of a constant amount of cytochrome b559 and a saturating amount of the second cytosolic component. It is apparent that maximal O2·¯ production is obtained at molar excesses over cytochrome b559 of 40:1, for p67phox and 15:1 for Rac1.TABLE I.O2·¯ production by a semirecombinant cell-free system in the presence and absence of p47phox Cell-free activation of NADPH oxidase was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The concentration of cytochrome b559 varied from 0.05 to 0.08 μM.

We propose that the induction of electron flow in cytochrome b559 is mediated by the cooperative action of p67phox and Rac1, in the GTP-bound state, and that p47phox is not directly involved in this process. This proposal is compatible with a number of earlier findings. These are: (a) p67phox is found in the cytosol of phagocytes as a complex with p47phox (33Park J.-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M.

Whereas some of these interactions are constitutive, others are enhanced by stimuli eliciting O2·¯ generation (40De Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (d) stimulus-dependent translocation of p67phox to the membrane in intact cells requires the interaction of its NH2-terminal domain (residues 1-246) with the two SH3 domains of p47phox (40De Mendez I.

The only exception is the report by Uhlinger et al. (46Uhlinger D.J. Taylor K.L. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22095-22098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), proposing, on the basis of kinetic analysis of NADPH oxidase activation in a semirecombinant cell-free system, that p67phox interacts directly with cytochrome b559; (f) there is evidence (47Diekmann D.

Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 991-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); (g) finally, indirect evidence was presented for an interaction between Rac2 and cytochrome b559 by the finding of reduced membrane localization of Rac2 in cells of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients lacking cytochrome b559 (50Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We conclude that, in a cell-free setting, a marked level of NADPH oxidase activation can be achieved in the absence of p47phox. It is likely that the unassisted interaction of p67phox (and Rac1?) with cytochrome b559 is either of low affinity or possesses a high dissociation rate. p47phox, by virtue of its ability to bind to both cytochrome b559 and p67phox, by molecular affinities enhanced by in vivo or in vitro activating mechanisms (37Sumimoto H. Kage Y. Nunoi H. Sasaki H. Nose T. Fukumaki Y. Ohno M. Minakami S. Takeshige K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 40De Mendez I. Adams A.G. Sokolic R.A. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1211-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serves as a bridge leading to the establishment of a stable bond. It is also possible that binding of p47phox to p67phox and cytochrome b559 is not simultaneous but sequential, as recently proposed in another context (41De Leo F.R. Ulman K.V. Davis A.R. Jutila K.L. Quinn M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17013-17020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex in the absence of p47phox is clearly nonphysiological, as demonstrated by the impairment of O2·¯ production by phagocytes of patients with the p47phox-deficient form of CGD, and there is little doubt that, in the intact cell, p47phox is required for optimal O2·¯ production. It is, however, significant, that CGD patients, lacking p47phox, have a milder form of disease and higher intracellular oxidant production than those lacking cytochrome b559 (cited in 25Cross A.R. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6543-6548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).The most likely reason for our observation not having been made earlier is that its occurrence is dependent on p67phox and Rac1 being present in marked molar excesses in relation to cytochrome b559. This requirement is overcome, under physiological conditions, by the “bridging” action of p47phox. INTRODUCTIONThe production of oxygen radicals, in response to triggering of cell-surface receptors, is the paramount microbicidal mechanism of phagocytic cells. The primary reaction in this process is the generation of superoxide (O2·¯), 1The abbreviations used are: O2·¯superoxideGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateLiDSlithium dodecyl sulfateCGDchronic granulomatous disease. derived by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen, catalyzed by a membrane-bound heterodimeric flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559), utilizing NADPH as the source of electrons (reviewed in 1Rotrosen D.

Electron flow from NADPH to oxygen is activated consequent to the interaction of cytochrome b559 with three cytosolic proteins, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac (1 or 2), leading to the formation of a multimolecular structure, known as the NADPH oxidase complex (reviewed in 4McPhail L.C. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The elicitation of an oxidative burst in intact phagocytes is accompanied by the translocation to the plasma membrane of about 10% of p47phox and p67phox (5Clark R.A. Volpp B.D. Leidal K.G. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Translocation of p47phox to the membrane is linked to the phosphorylation of the component at multiple sites (6Okamura N. Curnutte J.T. Roberts R.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6777-6782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, movement of p47phox and p67phox to the membrane requires the presence of cytochrome b559 (7Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). It is of interest that membrane localization of p67phox is dependent on p47phox (7Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one of the functions of p47phox is to escort p67phox to the membrane.

The calculated molecular mass of 70,692 daltons was consistent with size of the purified enzyme.

Activation of VLCFAs to their CoA thioesters is apparently a crucial step and this step is catalyzed by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACS). VLACS activity localizes in peroxisomes and microsomes but not in mitochondria (3Singh H. Poulos A. Arch. Biochem.

A marked biochemical deterioration in subjects with this disease is a defect of oxidation of VLCFAs. Since fibroblasts from these patients showed a very low activity in formation of very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, it has been considered that a new synthetase, VLACS being different from long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (6Suzuki H.

These data indicate that ALDP is responsible for at least a part of X-ALD. The function of ALDP and the relation between ALDP and VLCFA oxidation activity are unknown.

Taketani S. Yokota S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), assigned as one of the ATP-binding cassette transporters (10Mosser J.

Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).VLACS was recently purified from rat liver peroxisomal membrane (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although our attempts to prepare a specific antibody were unsuccessful, the purified VLACS did provide partial amino acid sequence data of protease-digested polypeptides, and this made it feasible to begin the cloning of VLACS cDNA. We report here the isolation and sequencing of cDNA encoding rat VLACS, a comparison of the sequence to those of the related enzymes, the subcellular localization, and the biosynthesis of functional VLACS in COS-1 cells.DISCUSSIONA full-length VLACS cDNA clone was obtained from a rat λgt 11 cDNA library, using degenerative primers designed based on partial amino acid sequences of peptide fragments from rat liver VLACS. This clone was confirmed to encode VLACS, sequence analysis revealed the existence of the regions corresponding to the peptide fragments from the purified VLACS, the calculated molecular mass of the coding region corresponded to that of the purified VLACS, the size of mRNA in Northern blot analysis was similar to that of the full-length clone, the DEHP-induction motif of the mRNA was similar to that of VLACS activity in rat liver (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the antibody raised against cDNA-expressed protein in E. coli specifically cross-reacted with the purified VLACS, and the specific activities and the substrate specificity of the cDNA-expressed protein in COS-1 cells were similar to those of the purified VLACS, respectively.On considering subcellular localization of acyl-CoA synthases, distributions of LACS and VLACS seem to be important. LACS was found to localize in peroxisomes, mitochondrial outer membranes, and microsomes (39Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). VLACS was estimated to be present in peroxisomes, but absent in mitochondria due to subcellular distribution of lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, VLACS was detected only in peroxisomes and microsomes (Fig. 6), and the calculated specific lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activities in peroxisomal and microsomal fractions were much the same value of the purified VLACS, which is compatible with previous observations (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).VLACS has been considered a peroxisomal membrane protein (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP, therefore, VLACS is expected to have a targeting signal into peroxisomes. In mammalian peroxisomal proteins, peroxisomal targeting signals 1 and 2 were identified (37Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and they seem to be specific to peroxisomal matrix protein. VLACS, as well as 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP, did not have these signals, hence a hitherto unknown targeting signal(s) specific to peroxisomal membrane proteins may exist. In hydropathy analysis (45Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar), VLACS has no typical transmembrane region (data not shown), unlike 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP. These results can serve as a good base for future projects such as a topological study of VLACS on peroxisomal membrane proteins and interaction of VLACS with ALDP and other peroxisomal membrane proteins, and this will be important to understand the mechanism related to deficiency of the peroxisomal VLACS activity in X-ALD fibroblasts (8Lazo O. Contreras M. Hashmi M. Stanley W. Irazu C. Singh I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). VLACS cDNA and the anti-VLACS antibody will be good tools for such studies.VLACS, LACS, and FATP seem to belong to the firefly luciferase family as there are two specific domains. Interestingly, VLACS has high sequence similarity to FATP (Fig. 8). However, there was no sequence homology in the NH2-terminal region between VLACS and FATP (1-41 amino acids in VLACS and 1-69 amino acids in FATP, Fig. 8). The NH2-terminal sequence of FATP (Fig. 8, underlined) is thought to encode a signal sequence to cytoplasmic membranes. The poor homology seems to reflect the difference concerning subcellular localization of the two proteins.Proteins in the firefly luciferase family generally show a high sequence divergence in their entire region, except for the two conserved domains, if they have different functions (42Toh H. Protein Seq. Data Anal. 1991; 4: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar). Since VLACS and FATP have different functions, it is the first case in the family that a high similarity through broad regions was observed between the two proteins with different functions. An additionally isolated clone with FATP cDNA was shown to encode mouse LACS. Interestingly, this LACS was found to have function not only as activation of fatty acids but also as active uptake of long-chain fatty acids (41Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Attention needs to be given to whether VLACS also functions as VLCFAs transporter.

Biophys. 1987; 259: 382-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Activation of VLCFAs to their CoA thioesters is apparently a crucial step and this step is catalyzed by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACS). VLACS activity localizes in peroxisomes and microsomes but not in mitochondria (3Singh H. Poulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is the most common hereditary disease among the peroxisomal diseases and is characterized by progressive demyelination of the white matter and by adrenocortical insufficiency (4Moser H.W.

A marked biochemical deterioration in subjects with this disease is a defect of oxidation of VLCFAs. Since fibroblasts from these patients showed a very low activity in formation of very long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, it has been considered that a new synthetase, VLACS being different from long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (6Suzuki H.

VLACS cDNA and the anti-VLACS antibody will be good tools for such studies.VLACS, LACS, and FATP seem to belong to the firefly luciferase family as there are two specific domains. Interestingly, VLACS has high sequence similarity to FATP (Fig. 8). However, there was no sequence homology in the NH2-terminal region between VLACS and FATP (1-41 amino acids in VLACS and 1-69 amino acids in FATP, Fig. 8). The NH2-terminal sequence of FATP (Fig. 8, underlined) is thought to encode a signal sequence to cytoplasmic membranes. The poor homology seems to reflect the difference concerning subcellular localization of the two proteins.Proteins in the firefly luciferase family generally show a high sequence divergence in their entire region, except for the two conserved domains, if they have different functions (42Toh H. Protein Seq. Data Anal. 1991; 4: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar). Since VLACS and FATP have different functions, it is the first case in the family that a high similarity through broad regions was observed between the two proteins with different functions. An additionally isolated clone with FATP cDNA was shown to encode mouse LACS. Interestingly, this LACS was found to have function not only as activation of fatty acids but also as active uptake of long-chain fatty acids (41Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Attention needs to be given to whether VLACS also functions as VLCFAs transporter. A full-length VLACS cDNA clone was obtained from a rat λgt 11 cDNA library, using degenerative primers designed based on partial amino acid sequences of peptide fragments from rat liver VLACS. This clone was confirmed to encode VLACS, sequence analysis revealed the existence of the regions corresponding to the peptide fragments from the purified VLACS, the calculated molecular mass of the coding region corresponded to that of the purified VLACS, the size of mRNA in Northern blot analysis was similar to that of the full-length clone, the DEHP-induction motif of the mRNA was similar to that of VLACS activity in rat liver (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the antibody raised against cDNA-expressed protein in E. coli specifically cross-reacted with the purified VLACS, and the specific activities and the substrate specificity of the cDNA-expressed protein in COS-1 cells were similar to those of the purified VLACS, respectively. On considering subcellular localization of acyl-CoA synthases, distributions of LACS and VLACS seem to be important. LACS was found to localize in peroxisomes, mitochondrial outer membranes, and microsomes (39Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Yokota S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). VLACS was estimated to be present in peroxisomes, but absent in mitochondria due to subcellular distribution of lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activity (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the present study, VLACS was detected only in peroxisomes and microsomes (Fig. 6), and the calculated specific lignoceroyl-CoA synthetase activities in peroxisomal and microsomal fractions were much the same value of the purified VLACS, which is compatible with previous observations (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). VLACS has been considered a peroxisomal membrane protein (24Uchida Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Hashimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP, therefore, VLACS is expected to have a targeting signal into peroxisomes. In mammalian peroxisomal proteins, peroxisomal targeting signals 1 and 2 were identified (37Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and they seem to be specific to peroxisomal matrix protein. VLACS, as well as 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP, did not have these signals, hence a hitherto unknown targeting signal(s) specific to peroxisomal membrane proteins may exist. In hydropathy analysis (45Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar), VLACS has no typical transmembrane region (data not shown), unlike 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein and ALDP. These results can serve as a good base for future projects such as a topological study of VLACS on peroxisomal membrane proteins and interaction of VLACS with ALDP and other peroxisomal membrane proteins, and this will be important to understand the mechanism related to deficiency of the peroxisomal VLACS activity in X-ALD fibroblasts (8Lazo O.

https://openalex.org/W2138537891,"Structural studies on the N-linked oligosaccharides of Haemonchus contortus, an economically important nematode that parasitizes domestic ruminants, have revealed core fucosylation of a type not previously observed in any eukaryotic glycoprotein. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed on detergent extracts of homogenized adult H. contortus and on purified H11, a glycoprotein isolated from intestinal brush borders which has been previously shown to be an effective vaccine antigen. The major N-linked glycans identified in the present study have up to three fucose residues attached to their chitobiose cores. The fucoses are found at the 3- and/or 6-positions of the proximal GlcNAc and at the 3-position of the distal GlcNAc. The latter substitution is unique in N-glycans. Most anti-H11 monoclonal antibodies are known to recognize carbohydrate epitopes, and it is possible that the newly discovered multifucosylated core structures are highly immunogenic in this glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2026536182,"Glucokinase reversibly partitions between a bound and a free state in the hepatocyte in response to the metabolic status of the cell. Maximum binding occurs at low [glucose] (<5 mM) and minimum binding at high [glucose] or in the presence of sorbitol or fructose. In this study we determined the binding characteristics of glucokinase in the hepatocyte in situ, by adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression combined with the digitonin-permeabilization technique. We also determined the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to changes in either total glucokinase overexpression or in free glucokinase activity. Glucokinase overexpression is associated with an increase in both free and bound activity, with an overall decrease in the proportion of bound activity. In hepatocytes incubated at low [glucose] (0-5 mM), glucokinase binding involves a high-affinity binding site with a Kd of ∼0.1 μM and a binding capacity of ∼3 pmol/mg total cell protein and low-affinity binding with a Kd of ∼1.6 μM. Increasing glucose concentration to 20 mM causes a dose-dependent increase in the Kd of the high- affinity site to ∼0.6 μM, and this effect was mimicked by 50 μM sorbitol, a precursor of fructose 1-P, confirming that this site is the regulatory protein of glucokinase.Glycogen synthesis determined from the incorporation of [2-3H,U-14C]glucose into glycogen at 5 mM or 10 mM glucose was very sensitive to small increases in total glucokinase activity and correlated more closely with the increase in free glucokinase activity. The relation between glycogenic flux and glucokinase activity is sigmoidal. Expression of the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to glucokinase activity as the control coefficient reveals that the coefficient is greater for the incorporation of 2-tritium (which occurs exclusively by the direct pathway) than for incorporation of 14C label (which involves direct and indirect pathways) and is greater at 5 mM glucose (when glucokinase is maximally sequestered at its high-affinity site) than at 10 mM glucose. The results support the hypothesis that compartmentation of glucokinase in the hepatocyte increases the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to small changes in total glucokinase activity and that glucose-induced translocation of glucokinase has a major role in the acute control of glycogen synthesis.

INTRODUCTIONGlucokinase (hexokinase IV or D), is one of four hexokinase isoenzymes expressed in vertebrates (1Walker D.G. Essays Biochem. 1966; 2: 33-67Google Scholar). It differs from the other isoenzymes in its lower molecular mass, a low affinity for glucose and sigmoidal kinetics, and in binding to a 68-kDa regulatory protein, which decreases its affinity for glucose (2Magnuson M.A. Jetton T.L. Berdanier C.D. Hargrove J.L. Nutrition and Gene Expression. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 143-167Google Scholar, 3Iynedjian P.B. Biochem.

Binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein is competitive with glucose (5Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and is influenced by fructose 6-P and fructose 1-P (6Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Glucokinase is expressed in liver cells, insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas, and small populations of neuroendocrine cells (7Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Milburn J.L. Cassidy L. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4521-4530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jetton J.L. Liang Y. Pettepher C.C. Zimmerman E.C. Cox F.G. Horvath K. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

Hepatic glucokinase is conventionally assayed in the high-speed supernatant of liver homogenates and has been assumed to be present in the free state in the cytoplasm (1Walker D.G. Essays Biochem. 1966; 2: 33-67Google Scholar, 2Magnuson M.A. Jetton T.L. Berdanier C.D. Hargrove J.L. Nutrition and Gene Expression.

However, studies on digitonin-permeabilized hepatocytes have shown that both glucokinase and its regulatory protein bind to the hepatocyte matrix by a Mg2+-dependent mechanism (11Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The proportion of the enzyme that is bound is dependent on the substrates with which hepatocytes are incubated before permeabilization with digitonin. Maximum binding occurs at low [glucose] (<5 mM) and minimum binding occurs at high [glucose] or at low concentrations of fructose or sorbitol (13Agius L. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14Agius L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which are precursors of fructose-1-P (15Davies D.R. Detheux M. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Binding of the regulatory protein to the cell matrix is not affected by these substrates (12Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), suggesting that the regulatory protein acts as a receptor for binding glucokinase to the cell matrix.Adenovirus-mediated enzyme expression is potentially a very powerful tool to modulate the concentration of a single enzyme in the intact cell in situ in order to determine the consequent changes in metabolic flux (16Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Marked overexpression of glucokinase in hepatocytes using adenovirus is associated with various changes in glucose metabolism including a large increase in glycogen deposition (17O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The present study had two aims. First, to determine the binding characteristics of glucokinase in the hepatocyte in situ by combining adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression with the digitonin-permeabilization technique. Second, to determine the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to small increases in glucokinase overexpression. We demonstrate that there is both high-affinity and low-affinity binding for glucokinase in the hepatocyte, and that the rate of glycogen synthesis is very sensitive to small increases in total glucokinase activity and correlates more closely with the free glucokinase activity. The sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to changes in total glucokinase activity is greatest at low glucose concentration, thus demonstrating the role of glucose-induced translocation of glucokinase in the acute control of hepatic glycogen synthesis.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, by combining adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression with digitonin permeabilization we evaluated the effect of increments in total glucokinase activity on the distribution of the enzyme between bound and free states. Because the amount of the regulatory protein as determined by Western blotting was unchanged in cells overexpressing glucokinase, it was possible to determine the capacity and affinity of glucokinase binding in situ. The data show that there is high-affinity binding for glucokinase with a binding capacity that exceeds the molar amount of endogenous glucokinase by less than 2-fold. The Kd of this high-affinity binding was dependent on the substrates with which the hepatocytes were preincubated before permeabilization with digitonin. The increase in Kd of this site with sorbitol (a precursor of fructose 1-P (11Agius L. Peak M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)) confirms that this site is the regulatory protein because binding of glucokinase to the regulatory protein is dissociated by fructose 1-P (6Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).There was also low-affinity binding with a Kd of ∼1.6 μM and a capacity corresponding to approximately 2-3 times that of the high-affinity binding. The low-affinity binding, unlike the high-affinity binding was very sensitive to increasing digitonin concentration 2L. Agius, M. Peak, C. B. Newgard, A. M. Gomez-Foix, and J. J. Guinovart, unpublished results. suggesting that it may be associated with membranes. It is as yet unclear whether this low-affinity binding constitutes a specific receptor for glucokinase. The possibility that this site may be a low-affinity conformation of the regulatory protein cannot be excluded. The binding characteristics of this low-affinity binding could only be determined in cells incubated at low glucose because of non-linearity of the plots (free/bound versus free activity) at high glucose. Linearity is expected if binding is non-cooperative (22Atkinson D.E. Cellular Energy Metabolism and its Regulation. Academic Press, New York1977: 139-140Google Scholar). Whether the non-linearity at high glucose was due to co-operative binding could not be resolved from the data.A key finding from the binding experiments is that a small increase in glucokinase overexpression (by less than 40% above endogenous levels) is associated with a much larger fractional increase in the free glucokinase activity because the percentage binding decreases sharply with overexpression. This effect is most marked at low glucose (0-5 mM). The physiological implication is that a small change in the total amount of hepatic glucokinase as occurs between fed and fasted states would be associated with a much larger change in free activity, if the amount of the regulatory protein does not change by a corresponding amount. The amount of regulatory protein in rat liver decreases during fasting and increases during refeeding. However, the proportional changes of the regulatory protein are smaller than the changes in the amount of glucokinase (30Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our findings therefore suggest that changes in the total amount of glucokinase during fasting or refeeding would be associated with larger changes in free glucokinase activity.Adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression is associated with a large increase in glycogen synthesis (17O'Doherty R.M. Lehman D.L. Seoane J. Gomez-Foix A.M. Guinovart J.J. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20524-20530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), consistent with a major role of changes in total amount of glucokinase in controlling glycogen synthesis. In the present study we used metabolic control analysis (determination of control coefficients) to evaluate the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to small increases in glucokinase activity. Control coefficients express the sensitivity of pathway flux to small changes in total enzyme activity and represent the slope of plots of log flux versus log enzyme activity. Since glucokinase partitions between bound and free states and glucokinase overexpression is associated with larger increases in free than in bound activity we determined the coefficients in relation to either total glucokinase activity (which would be equivalent to the total enzyme concentration) or to the free fraction which would approximate glucokinase activity if the bound fraction is much less active than the free activity as predicted from the kinetic properties of glucokinase in association with the regulatory protein (4Van Schaftingen E. Diabetologia. 1994; 37: S43-S47Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).The coefficients expressed in relation to total glucokinase activity report three findings. First, that the coefficient (or sensitivity of flux) is greater for incorporation of 2-tritium than of 14C label into glycogen. Second, that the coefficients for incorporation of both 14C and 2-tritium are greater than unity. Third, that these coefficients are greater when determined at 5 mM glucose than at 10 mM glucose.Incorporation of 2-tritium into glycogen occurs only by the direct pathway of glycogen synthesis but is an underestimate of the direct pathway because of loss of 2-tritium label at the phosphoglucoisomerase step. The higher coefficients for incorporation of 2-tritium relative to 14C can be explained by glucokinase overexpression favoring the incorporation of glucose 6-phosphate to glycogen relative to loss of 2-tritium at the phosphoglucoisomerase step.A coefficient greater than unity for incorporation of [14C]glucose into glycogen indicates that the increase in glycogen synthesis is greater than the increase in glucokinase activity. One possible explanation is that cycling between glucokinase and glucose 6-phosphatase increases the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to glucokinase activity (31Wals P.A. Katz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18343-18352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Newsholme E.A. Crabtree B. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1976; 41: 61-109PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fell D.A. Sauro H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that the compartmentation of glucokinase between bound and free states increases the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to changes in total glucokinase activity.Since glucokinase overexpression is associated with a greater increase in free than in bound activity at glucose concentrations between 5 and 15 mM (Fig. 4) the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to glucokinase might be expected to parallel the increase in free activity, since this is a kinetically more active state. This hypothesis is supported by two sets of observations. First, that the coefficient expressed relative to total glucokinase activity is greater at 5 mM than at 10 mM glucose and accordingly, the increase in free activity is greater at 5 mM glucose (Fig. 4). Second, that when the coefficients are expressed relative to the free activity to correct for the different changes in free activity at 5 and 10 mM glucose (for the same total overexpression) the coefficients are lower than those expressed relative to total glucokinase activity and the difference in coefficients between 5 and 10 mM glucose is abolished. From a physiological standpoint the results support the hypothesis that sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to glucokinase is greatest at low glucose, and that the glucose-induced translocation of glucokinase, which results in increased free activity, constitutes a major mechanism for the acute increase in glycogen synthesis in response to an increase in extracellular glucose concentration.In summary, the present findings support two main conclusions that are relevant from a physiological perspective. First, that small changes in total glucokinase activity (less than 50% above endogenous levels) as are observed during refeeding after a fast in vivo (30Vandercammen A. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), result in much larger changes in glycogen synthesis as indicated by control coefficients greater than unity. Second, that glucose-induced translocation of glucokinase as a result of the 5-fold increase in the Kd of the high-affinity binding site is a major mechanism for the acute control of glucokinase activity as indicated by the higher control coefficient of glycogen synthesis to total glucokinase activity at 5 mM as compared with 10 mM glucose. We suggest that adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression is a powerful tool to evaluate the roles of glucokinase expression and of short-term glucokinase translocation to the control of hepatic glycogen synthesis.

Marked overexpression of glucokinase in hepatocytes using adenovirus is associated with various changes in glucose metabolism including a large increase in glycogen deposition (17O'Doherty R.M.

The present study had two aims. First, to determine the binding characteristics of glucokinase in the hepatocyte in situ by combining adenovirus-mediated glucokinase overexpression with the digitonin-permeabilization technique. Second, to determine the sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to small increases in glucokinase overexpression. We demonstrate that there is both high-affinity and low-affinity binding for glucokinase in the hepatocyte, and that the rate of glycogen synthesis is very sensitive to small increases in total glucokinase activity and correlates more closely with the free glucokinase activity. The sensitivity of glycogen synthesis to changes in total glucokinase activity is greatest at low glucose concentration, thus demonstrating the role of glucose-induced translocation of glucokinase in the acute control of hepatic glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1978991443,"The aberrant phosphorylation of the neurofilament high molecular weight subunit (NFH) in the neuronal perikaryon is a common feature of several neurological diseases. We demonstrated a strong correlation between hyperphosphorylation of the NFH carboxyl-terminal domain and activation of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) -γ in PC12 cells. Agents that activated SAPKγ in PC12 cells also caused the hyperphosphorylation of perikaryal NFH in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons. The NFH carboxyl-terminal domain was phosphorylated by SAPKγ in vitro, and the use of peptide substrates indicated that this event occurred preferentially at KSPXE motifs. We propose that SAPKγ, perhaps in concert with other SAPKs, is involved in the abnormal phosphorylation of perikaryal NFH. This finding could lead to new insights into the etiology of several neurological diseases.

Lasek R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). In common with other intermediate filament proteins, each NF subunit contains a highly conserved α-helical rod domain, involved in coiled-coil dimer formation, flanked by an amino-terminal head domain and a carboxyl-terminal tail domain (6Geisler N. Kaufmann E. Fischer S. Plessman U. Weber K. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The size differences between NF subunits are due to variations in the length of the tail domains (6Geisler N. Kaufmann E. Fischer S. Plessman U. Weber K.

The tail domains of NFM and NFH display complex subdomain patterns with several distinct motifs (10Harris J. Ayyub C. Shaw G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One such motif, the Lys-Ser-Pro (KSP) sequence, is especially abundant in the tail domain of NFH, with numbers ranging from 43 in human NFH (11Lees J.F. Shneidman P.S. Skuntz S.F. Carden M.J.

These KSP repeats represent the major phosphorylation sites in NFH and NFM (14Lee V.M.-Y. Otvos Jr., L. Carden M.J. Hollosi M. Dietzschold B. Lazzarini R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The electrophoretic mobilities of NFH and NFM on SDS-polyacrylamide gels are retarded significantly by phosphorylation of the KSP repeats (16Julien J.-P. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The knowledge that KSP repeats contain the major phosphorylation sites in NFM and NFH has focused efforts to identify the relevant kinases within the superfamily of proline-directed protein kinases. Several neuronal enzymes in this category have been shown to phosphorylate NFH in vitro. These include glycogen synthase kinase-3 (17Guan R.J. Khatra B.S. Cohlberg J.A. J. Biol.

Gainer H. Pant H.C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), several kinases may participate in tail domain phosphorylation, perhaps through a hierarchical mechanism (22Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The development of monoclonal antibodies that could distinguish between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated KSP repeats in the tail domains of NFH and NFM led to the discovery that axonal NFs are normally more highly phosphorylated than those located in the perikaryon and dendrites (23Sternberger L.A. Sternberger N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6126-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 24Lee V.M.-Y. Carden M.J. Schlaepfer W.W. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3474-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This normal phosphorylation pattern is characteristically altered in a variety of neuropathologies, where perikaryal NFs become hyperphosphorylated (25Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1987; 46: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 26Nixon R.A. Brain Pathol. 1993; 3: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We recently showed (27Jayaraman D. Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 13: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (CI), a potent calpain (28Saito K.-I. Nixon R.A. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 231-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and proteasome inhibitor (29Tsubuki S. Kawasaki H. Saito Y. Miyashita N. Inomata M. Kawashima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We have now found that agents known to activate stress response pathways have an effect similar to that of CI. These pathways involve proline-directed kinases of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, which include the ERKs, the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs), and p38. (31Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The MAP kinases are related structurally and are activated by similar cascades in response to diverse external stimuli. The SAPK pathway responds to intra- and extracellular stress stimuli and may promote inhibition of cell growth (32Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 33Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). There is a degree of cross-talk between the different MAP kinase signaling cascades as evidenced by the activation of ERKs, SAPKs, and p38 by hyperosmolarity (34Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 35Han J. Lee J.-D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). However, the various MAP kinases also respond differently to certain stimuli, one example being the activation by arsenite of p38, but not the ERKs, in PC12 cells (36Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso- Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). We report here that CI caused the prolonged activation of ERK-1/2 and SAPKγ. The stimulation of NFH tail domain phosphorylation in PC12 cells by various stress response activators correlated with the degree of SAPKγ activation and the kinase phosphorylated recombinant NFH tail domain in vitro. These results suggest that stress-activated protein kinases may be responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of perikaryal NFs seen in various neuropathologies. CI, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal (CII), anisomycin, and anti-NFH monoclonal antibody N52 were purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) was from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). Nerve growth factor (NGF) (2.5S) was purchased from Prince Laboratories (Toronto, ON). Anti-NF monoclonal antibodies SMI 31 and SMI 34 were obtained from Sternberger Monoclonals, Inc. (Baltimore, MD). Anti-SAPKγ (C-17), anti-ERK-1 (C-16), and anti-ERK-2 (C-14) polyclonal antibodies as well as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun (amino acids 1-79) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Myelin basic protein and bovine serum albumin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, ON). Bovine apotransferrin was from ICN (Mississauga, ON). GST-NFH fusion protein containing the entire tail domain of murine NFH (amino acids 412-1087; 12Julien J.-P. Côté F. Beaudet L. Sidky M. Flavell D. Grosveld F. Mushynski W.E.

Embryos were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats that were previously anesthetized with ether and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. DRGs from E15 rat embryos were dissected, dissociated with trypsin, and maintained in defined medium N1 (37Bottenstein J.E. Sato G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar) containing 30 μg ml−1 bovine apotransferrin, with added 0.9% bovine serum albumin, 6 ng ml−1 2.5 S NGF, and antibiotics. Culture dishes were coated with cross-linked collagen (38Macklis J.D. Sidman R.L. Shine H.D. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1985; 21: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in a procedure involving overnight precipitation of 50 μg ml−1 collagen followed by cross-linking for 2 h at room temperature with 130 μg ml−1 of 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide-p-toluenesulfonate. Dissociated DRGs were plated either dispersely or in a volume of 10 μl at the center of a 35-mm dish. In the latter case, the cells were allowed to attach for 30 min before flooding with defined medium. The localization of neuronal perikarya in a small centrally located region allowed them to be separated manually from the surrounding halo of neurites. Localized and dispersed DRG cultures were maintained for 19-20 days before being used for experiments. The PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained according to published procedures (39Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4871) Google Scholar, 40Lindenbaum M.H. Carbonetto S. Grosveld F. Flavell D. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5662-5667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were grown in 85% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), and antibiotics. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4) and lysed with 200 μl of SAPKγ lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. An aliquot of each supernatant was used to determine the protein concentration and equalize the amount of protein used in each set of experiments. SAPKγ was immunoprecipitated from 100 to 150 μg of total protein using 10 μl of anti-SAPKγ polyclonal antibody (C-17) (100 μg ml−1) and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B suspension (Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfé, PQ) for 3 h at 4°C. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with SAPKγ lysis buffer and once with SAPKγ kinase buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 25 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The assays were initiated by adding to the sedimented beads 10 μl of SAPKγ kinase buffer containing 0.5 μg of GST-c-Jun and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol). The reactions were incubated at 30°C for 20 min and then terminated by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol). Phosphorylation of the substrate protein was visualized after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar) by autoradiography and quantified using a Fujix BAS2000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Bio-Imaging). The assay was similar to that for SAPKγ except for the following changes. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 0.2% Nonidet-P40, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The kinases were immunoprecipitated with 5 μl each of anti-ERK-1 (C-16) (100 μg/ml) and anti-ERK-2 (C-14) (100 μg/ml) polyclonal antibodies. ERK kinase buffer consisted of 30 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Assays were initiated by adding to the sedimented beads 20 μl of ERK kinase buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5 Ci/mmol). The reactions were terminated after 20 min at 30°C by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of Coomassie Blue R250-staining protein bands excised from SDS-PAGE gels. For the separate analysis of neurite and perikaryal fractions, dissociated DRGs were plated on a small area at the center of a dish as described above. This allowed for the manual separation of a central zone rich in neuronal cell bodies from the halo of neurites by using a circular punch with a diameter slightly larger than that of the neuronal cell body mass. The DRG fractions were solubilized in SDS sample buffer. PC12 cells were harvested in 2% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 6.8, and protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on slab gels by SDS-PAGE (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.) in buffer containing 48 mM Tris, 39 mM glycine, and 5% methanol. The membrane was then blocked with 1% skimmed milk powder in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (20 mM Tris, pH 7.7, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), incubated with primary antibodies, and developed using the ECL Western blotting Detection Kit (Amersham Corp.). Dispersed DRG cultures were grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips. The cells were fixed with 3.7% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, then with methanol at −20°C, rinsed, blocked with 50% goat serum in TBS (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl), 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated for 30 min with SMI 34 monoclonal antibody (1/1000) in TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 containing 10% goat serum. After extensive washing, the cells were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in TBS, 0.3% Triton X-100 containing 10% goat serum. The effects on NFH phosphorylation of agents that are known to activate members of the MAP kinase family were assessed by Western blotting using three different monoclonal antibodies. N52 is a NFH-specific, phosphorylation-independent antibody (42Shaw G. Osborn M. Weber K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 42: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar) that was used to assess increases in NFH phosphorylation by detecting species with a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE (16Julien J.-P. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SMI 31 and SMI 34 antibodies bind to different phosphoepitopes involving KSP repeats in the tail domains of NFH and sometimes NFM (43Shea T.B. Beerman M.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 44: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with CI (30 μM) for 10 h caused all of the NFH to shift to a more slowly migrating form (Fig. 1) and resulted in the greatest increase in NFH immunoreactivity to SMI 31 and SMI 34 among the various agents that were tested. Treatment of PC12 cells with CII (30 μM) for 10 h did not cause any detectable change in NFH phosphorylation. NGF, an activator of ERKs in PC12 cells (44Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 45Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), also had no noticeable effect on NFH phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Neither did treatment with anisomycin or TNFα, two SAPK activators (46Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dal T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12781-12786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), each caused a partial shift in the mobility of NFH (Fig. 1). Increased osmolarity rendered NFH immunoreactive with both SMI 31 and SMI 34, whereas arsenite treatment produced NFH that was more immunoreactive with SMI 31. PC12 cells were treated with 0.4 M NaCl or 0.5 mM arsenite for no longer than 4 h, as they began detaching from the substratum beyond this time point. Treatment with 0.05 mM arsenite for 10 h yielded results similar to those with 0.5 mM arsenite for 4 h. The band slightly above NFH that was weakly reactive with SMI 31 antibody did not appear to be a slower migrating form of NFH, since it was not detected by N52 antibody. Since only certain of the agents known to activate SAPKs caused an increase in NFH phosphorylation, we determined whether the discrepancies were due to variation in the extent of enzyme activation. Hyperosmolarity produced a relatively strong activation of SAPKγ in PC12 cells, and the high level of activity was maintained for approximately 1 h (Fig. 2A). Arsenite produced approximately the same level of activation as hyperosmolarity, although the activation was more prolonged (Fig. 2B). The increase in NFH phosphorylation was nevertheless comparable in the two cases (Fig. 1), suggesting that toxicity may have dampened the effect of more prolonged activation by arsenite. Anisomycin produced a very modest level of SAPKγ activation which peaked at 0.5 h (Fig. 3A). TNFα also caused only a modest and transient activation of SAPKγ (Fig. 3B), similar to that reported in HeLa cells (48Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of CI and CII on ERK-1/2 activity with that of NGF, a known ERK activator. NGF caused a prolonged activation of ERK-1/2 (Fig. 4) similar to what has already been reported (44Qiu M.-S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 45Traverse S. Gomez N. Paterson H. Marshall C. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Prolonged ERK activation was also seen following CI treatment, but at a lower level than was obtained with NGF. The lowest level of ERK activation was observed with CII treatment. As shown in Fig. 5, CI treatment of DRG cultures produced a complete shift in the mobility of perikaryal NFH, to a level normally seen only in axonal NFH. CII, which did not cause an observable increase in NFH phosphorylation in PC12 cells, effected a partial decrease in the mobility of perikaryal NFH in DRGs. Hyperosmotic shock caused a more extensive shift in the mobility of perikaryal NFH. Arsenite treatment caused a broadening of the NFH band, whereas anisomycin treatment had no effect. CI treatment and hyperosmotic shock promoted the staining of neuronal perikarya with SMI 34 (Fig. 6, B and D, respectively). Treatment with CII (Fig. 6C), anisomycin, or arsenite (data not shown) did not enhance the staining of neuronal perikarya with SMI 34. Since hyperphosphorylation of perikaryal NFH and NFM has been observed following axonal damage (50Goldstein M.E. Cooper H.S. Bruce J. Carden M.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 1586-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether this effect could be reproduced in vitro. The neurites of DRG neurons in localized cultures were severed from their cell bodies, and the latter were harvested at different times after injury. The mobility of NFH on SDS-PAGE was unchanged at 2 and 5 h following neurite disruption (Fig. 7). A partial decrease in mobility was seen at 12 and 24 h, which was reversed by 48 h. It is likely that the elevated phosphorylation state of perikaryal NFH that occurs in both mechanically damaged cultures and in cultures exposed to other stressing agents is due to the activation of the same or related kinase(s). GST-NFH is a recombinant fusion protein that contains the entire tail domain of mouse NFH (amino acids 412-1087; 12Julien J.-P. Côté F. Beaudet L. Sidky M. Flavell D. Grosveld F. Mushynski W.E. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in a completely unphosphorylated state. 2M. G. Sacher, unpublished results. GST-NFH was phosphorylated by SAPKγ in an immunoprecipitation kinase assay (Fig. 8A), whereas GST alone was not phosphorylated under the same conditions (data not shown). GST-NFH was not as good a SAPKγ substrate as GST-c-Jun; 30-35 times more 32P was incorporated into GST-c-Jun than GST-NFH when the immunoprecipitation kinase assays were done in parallel. The KSP repeats in NFH contain different motifs. Three of the most abundant motifs are KSPXE, KSPEK, and KSPXK, where X is an uncharged amino acid residue, usually an Ala, a Gly, or a Val. Peptide-(601-615) (EAKSPAEAKSPAEAK) and peptide-(854-867) (VKSPAKEKAKSPEK) correspond to the amino acid sequence in murine NFH (12Julien J.-P. Côté F. Beaudet L. Sidky M. Flavell D. Grosveld F. Mushynski W.E. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Peptide-(601-615) contains 2 KSPXE motifs, and peptide-(854-867) contains both KSPXK and KSPEK motifs. Immunoprecipitation kinase assays of SAPKγ demonstrated that peptide-(601-615) was phosphorylated at a markedly higher level than peptide-(854-867) (Fig. 8B). In this study we have shown that treatment of PC12 cells and DRG neurons with agents that activate stress response pathways can promote the phosphorylation of KSP repeats in the tail domain of NFH. The extent to which NFH phosphorylation in PC12 cells was increased correlated with the degree of SAPKγ activation by various agents. The strongest activator, CI, as well as hyperosmotic shock, also increased the phosphorylation of perikaryal NFH in DRG neurons. Although other stress-activated kinases, in addition to SAPKγ, may also participate in this process, the ERKs did not appear to play a significant role in view of the failure of NGF treatment to cause a detectable increase in the phosphorylation state of NFH (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). In addition, treatment of PC12 cells with arsenite, which activates SAPKγ (Fig. 2), but not ERKs (36Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso- Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar), caused an increase in NFH phosphorylation. The evidence linking SAPKγ to the hyperphosphorylation of NFH is compelling. There was a strong correlation between the extent of KSP repeat phosphorylation and the degree of SAPKγ activation in PC12 cells. Only when SAPKγ was strongly activated, as in the case of treatment with 30 μM CI, 0.4 M NaCl, or 0.5 mM arsenite, was there a detectable increase in phosphorylation of the tail domain of NFH. More modest increases in SAPKγ activity caused by TNFα, anisomycin, or 30 μM CII were without apparent effect. However, lower levels of phosphorylation in the latter cases could have gone undetected since multiple phosphorylation events are required to cause the extensive shifts in gel electrophoretic mobility (16Julien J.-P.

As the BCR complex does not have any intrinsic kinase activity, the induction of tyrosine-protein phosphorylation must involve the participation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Accordingly, there is accumulating evidence that Lyn and Syk are responsible for the initiation of BCR-induced signals. This biochemical signal is required for all subsequent events of B cell activation, including rise in intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C, and ultimately cell proliferation or programmed cell death (reviewed in 1Pleiman C.M.

B cell lines that have lost expression of CD45 have a variety of abnormal characteristics (7Kawauchi K. Lazarus A.H. Rapoport M.J. Harwood A. Cambier J.C. J.

Studies of CD45-negative B cell plasmacytoma expressing BCR have shown that CD45 is required for BCR-induced calcium mobilization (9Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In contrast to this positive role of CD45, a negative regulatory role of CD45 was also reported using the CD45-deficient WEHI-231 B cells (10Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This mutant B cell shows marked spontaneous tyrosine phosphorylation before BCR stimulation and enhanced calcium mobilization upon BCR engagement. The reason for the differences between these cell lines is unknown but presumably reflects differences in other active molecules that may vary between them.Lyn, a member of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), is expressed in B cells, mast cells, and monocytes. Cross-linking of BCR induces an increase in Lyn tyrosine kinase activity, as determined by an increase in Lyn autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. Studies using Lyn-deficient chicken DT40 B cell lines have shown that Lyn is required for BCR-induced normal calcium mobilization, as well as for the increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced following receptor ligation (11Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice lacking expression of Lyn have circulating autoreactive antibodies, implicating that Lyn plays a role in establishing B cell tolerance (12Hibbs M.L. Tarlinton D.M. Armes J. Grail D. Hodgson G. Maglitto R. Stacker S.A. Dunn A.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 301-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 13Nishizumi H. Taniuchi I. Yamanashi Y. Kitamura D. Ilic D. Mori S. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Immunity. 1995; 3: 549-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar).Activity of Src family PTKs is inhibited by phosphorylation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue located near the C terminus. Csk phosphorylates Src family PTKs at this site and is a natural inhibitor of Src PTKs. In vitro, Src PTKs undergo autophosphorylation in their kinase domain. The extent of phosphorylation of autophosphorylation site in vivo correlates with their activity and appears to be required for maximum catalytic activity (reviewed in 14Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). One model for how CD45 regulates BCR signaling is that it interacts with BCR-activated PTKs, thought to be Src family PTKs such as Lyn. In support of this model, Lyn can be coprecipitated with CD45 (15Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible role of CD45 is to dephosphorylate tyrosine residue(s) of Src family PTKs, regulating their kinase activity. However, direct evidence for hyperphosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosines of Src family PTKs in CD45-deficient B cells has not been reported. Moreover, it has not been clear how CD45 regulation of Src PTKs is translated into BCR-mediated signal transduction.We have studied effects of CD45 on Lyn using CD45-deficient DT40 B cells. Lyn is dominantly expressed among Src family PTKs in DT40 cells. Our results demonstrated that not only C-terminal negative tyrosine, but also autophosphorylation tyrosine, is hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient B cells. Lyn activation following BCR stimulation is apparently diminished in this mutant cell. Thus, our findings suggest that dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn is an obligatory mechanism for its kinase participation in BCR signaling.DISCUSSIONOur previous observations indicate that activation of Lyn is an initial critical step for BCR signaling (11Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 23Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Phenotypes of CD45-deficient DT40 B cells are similar to those of Lyn-deficient cells, based on the following two criteria: (i) BCR-induced whole tyrosine phosphorylation pattern (Fig. 3) and (ii) BCR-induced calcium mobilization (Fig. 4). Indeed, BCR-induced Lyn activation, judged by in vitro kinase activity toward enolase (Fig. 5A), was significantly inhibited by loss of CD45. This conclusion is further supported by the minimal induction of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in CD45-deficient cells, since we have shown previously that phosphorylation of Cbl is mediated by Lyn in BCR signaling (29Tezuka T. Umemori H. Fusaki N. Yagi T. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In contrast to Lyn, Syk activation is not significantly affected by loss of CD45 (Fig. 7) (31Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27987-27990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since Lyn activation is decreased in CD45-deficient cells, this result appears to contradict our previous conclusion that Lyn enhances Syk kinase activity in BCR signaling (23Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, given the evidence that Syk is activated even in the absence of Lyn to some extent by receptor cross-linking, this observation implies that the Lyn-independent Syk activation occurs in CD45-deficient cells. In contrast to the delayed and slow activation of Syk in Lyn-deficient DT40 cells (23Kurosaki T. Takata M. Yamanashi Y. Inazu T. Taniguchi T. Yamamoto T. Yamamura H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), Syk activation in CD45-deficient cells is apparently normal. Thus, in wild-type cells, CD45 may negatively regulate the activity of Syk, directly or indirectly. Alternatively, the residual Lyn activation in CD45-deficient cells may be enough for enhancing Syk activity in BCR signaling.Syk-deficient DT40 cells show complete abolishment of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation (32Kurosaki T. Johnson S.A. Pao L. Sada K. Yamamura H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas IP3 was generated upon receptor engagement in CD45-deficient cells (data not shown), supporting the concept that Syk activation occurs even in the mutant cells. We have recently shown that IP3 generation is also abolished in Btk-deficient DT40 cells (33Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Thus, this result also implies that Btk activation is not significantly affected by loss of CD45. Taken together, CD45-deficient phenotypes suggest that among Lyn, Syk, and Btk, Lyn activation is dominantly regulated by CD45 in BCR signaling.There is evidence that Src PTKs are negatively regulated by phosphorylation on a conserved tyrosine near their C terminus. Dephosphorylation of tyrosine 527 in Src activates the protein kinase activity both in vivo and in vitro (14Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). This C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Lyn was hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient cells, providing the direct evidence that this site is a target of CD45 in B cells. Not only the C-terminal tyrosine, but also the autophosphorylation tyrosine, was hyperphosphorylated in mutant DT40 cells. In some CD45-deficient T cell lymphomas, mapping studies of the phosphorylation sites of Lck indicate that only the C-terminal tyrosine of Lck is hyperphosphorylated (34Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 35McFarland E.D.C.

A. 1993; 90: 1402-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), leading to its decreased kinase activity (36Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6302-6306Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). However, the possibility that dephosphorylation at autophosphorylation tyrosine of Src PTKs is also mediated by CD45 has been suggested. Indeed, in particular CD45-deficient T cell line YAC-1, loss of CD45 results in hyperphosphorylation of both autophosphorylation and negative regulatory tyrosines (37Burns C.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not established whether the autophosphorylation tyrosine of Lyn is dephosphorylated directly by CD45 in vivo. Given the evidence that CD45 is associated with Lyn in B cells (15Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that this dephosphorylation occurs directly by CD45.Hyperphosphorylated Lyn at both autophosphorylation and C-terminal tyrosines in CD45-deficient DT40 cells shows ∼5-fold lower in vitro kinase activity than wild-type cells at the resting state. Since C-terminal phosphorylation is inhibitory and autophosphorylation is stimulatory, this result indicates that phosphorylation status on C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn is dominant for determining its kinase activity.BCR-induced activation of Lyn from the CD45-deficient cells was significantly reduced. Because resting wild-type DT40 cells have Lyn that is constitutively dephosphorylated at both autophosphorylation and C-terminal tyrosines (Fig. 8C), these data suggest that dephosphorylation at either or both of these tyrosines is required for participation of Lyn in BCR signaling. In Csk-deficient DT40 cells, Lyn is dephosphorylated at C-terminal tyrosine and subsequently hyperphosphorylated at autophosphorylation tyrosine at the resting level, and this mutant cell shows augmented tyrosine phosphorylation after BCR stimulation (38Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn is a prerequisite for its participation in BCR-mediated signal transduction. Since this dephosphorylation is mediated by CD45, CD45 positively regulates BCR signaling through Lyn. Based on a proposed model of Src regulation, phosphorylation at the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine mediates an intramolecular association with the kinase's own Src homology 2 (SH2) domain and represses kinase activity (14Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Thus, dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn, in addition to increasing its kinase activity, may allow the unoccupied SH2 domain to bind to other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Indeed, binding of Lyn to phosphorylated Igα via its SH2 domain was reported to increase the kinase activity of Lyn (39Clark M.R. Johnson S.A. Cambier J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).With dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn, phosphorylation extent of autophosphorylation tyrosine at the resting state appears to increase the efficacy for BCR-induced activation of Lyn. As mentioned above, in Csk-deficient DT40 cells, BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation pattern is significantly augmented than wild-type cells, presumably by hyperphosphorylated Lyn at autophosphorylation tyrosine. In this context, CD45 may act to negatively modulate the efficacy of Lyn in BCR signal transduction, since our data provide the possibility that dephosphorylation of autophosphorylation tyrosine is also mediated by CD45.

As the BCR complex does not have any intrinsic kinase activity, the induction of tyrosine-protein phosphorylation must involve the participation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Accordingly, there is accumulating evidence that Lyn and Syk are responsible for the initiation of BCR-induced signals. This biochemical signal is required for all subsequent events of B cell activation, including rise in intracellular calcium, activation of protein kinase C, and ultimately cell proliferation or programmed cell death (reviewed in 1Pleiman C.M.

Studies of CD45-negative B cell plasmacytoma expressing BCR have shown that CD45 is required for BCR-induced calcium mobilization (9Justement L.B. Campbell K.S. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1991; 252: 1839-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In contrast to this positive role of CD45, a negative regulatory role of CD45 was also reported using the CD45-deficient WEHI-231 B cells (10Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This mutant B cell shows marked spontaneous tyrosine phosphorylation before BCR stimulation and enhanced calcium mobilization upon BCR engagement. The reason for the differences between these cell lines is unknown but presumably reflects differences in other active molecules that may vary between them.Lyn, a member of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs), is expressed in B cells, mast cells, and monocytes. Cross-linking of BCR induces an increase in Lyn tyrosine kinase activity, as determined by an increase in Lyn autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. Studies using Lyn-deficient chicken DT40 B cell lines have shown that Lyn is required for BCR-induced normal calcium mobilization, as well as for the increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced following receptor ligation (11Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice lacking expression of Lyn have circulating autoreactive antibodies, implicating that Lyn plays a role in establishing B cell tolerance (12Hibbs M.L. Tarlinton D.M. Armes J. Grail D.

Csk phosphorylates Src family PTKs at this site and is a natural inhibitor of Src PTKs. In vitro, Src PTKs undergo autophosphorylation in their kinase domain. The extent of phosphorylation of autophosphorylation site in vivo correlates with their activity and appears to be required for maximum catalytic activity (reviewed in 14Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). One model for how CD45 regulates BCR signaling is that it interacts with BCR-activated PTKs, thought to be Src family PTKs such as Lyn. In support of this model, Lyn can be coprecipitated with CD45 (15Brown V.K. Ogle E.W. Burkhardt A.L. Rowley R.B. Bolen J.B. Justement L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A possible role of CD45 is to dephosphorylate tyrosine residue(s) of Src family PTKs, regulating their kinase activity. However, direct evidence for hyperphosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosines of Src family PTKs in CD45-deficient B cells has not been reported. Moreover, it has not been clear how CD45 regulation of Src PTKs is translated into BCR-mediated signal transduction.We have studied effects of CD45 on Lyn using CD45-deficient DT40 B cells. Lyn is dominantly expressed among Src family PTKs in DT40 cells. Our results demonstrated that not only C-terminal negative tyrosine, but also autophosphorylation tyrosine, is hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient B cells. Lyn activation following BCR stimulation is apparently diminished in this mutant cell. Thus, our findings suggest that dephosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn is an obligatory mechanism for its kinase participation in BCR signaling."

We report that stable expression of Bcl-2 in HeLa cells is associated with multiple phenotypic changes. Treatment of HeLa cells with anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody (mAb) resulted in preferential degradation of lamin B compared with lamins A and C. Significant lamin B degradation was detected as early as 1 h after anti-CD95 mAb treatment. In contrast, lamins A and C as well as actin remained unchanged until 4 h after treatment with anti-CD95 mAb, a time point that correlated with the period of DNA fragmentation. These results indicate that selective degradation of lamin B is an early cellular event in response to activation of the CD95 pathway and that it precedes DNA fragmentation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 resulted in prevention of lamin B degradation and DNA fragmentation into oligonucleosome fragments in response to the apoptotic signal by anti-CD95 mAb. In addition, in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells that were protected against apoptosis, anti-CD95 mAb-induced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was completely blocked. Overexpression of Bcl-2 also resulted in restoration of the CD95-mediated signaling pathway involving activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (p50/RelA). These findings suggest that Bcl-2 prevents apoptosis in part by preventing the degradation of major nuclear polypeptides such as lamin B and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.

To study the mechanism of intracellular sorting of EGF-EGF receptor complexes to lysosomes, NIH 3T3 cells transfected with wild-type and mutant EGF receptors were employed. The kinetics of 125I-EGF trafficking was analyzed using low concentrations of the ligand to avoid saturation of the specific sorting system. The relative size of the pool of internalized 125I-EGF-receptor complexes that were capable of recycling decreased as receptors traversed the endosomal system. The rate of 125I-EGF sequestration from the recycling pathway correlated with the rate of 125I-EGF transition from early to late endosomes as measured by Percoll gradient fractionation. Deletion of the last 63 amino acids of the EGF receptor cytoplasmic tail did not inhibit the process of sequestration and targeting to the late endosomes and lysosomes. Truncation of the 123 residues, however, resulted in impaired lysosomal targeting and increased recycling of EGF. Receptor mutant in which 165 residues were deleted displayed maximal ability to recycle and a minimal extent of sorting to the late endosomes. The data suggest that two regions of the EGF receptor molecule, residues 1022-1063 and to a lesser extent residues 1063-1123, contribute in the regulation of routing of EGF receptors to the degradation pathway. The kinase-negative receptor mutant recycled EGF more intensively compared with the wild-type receptor, and the transport of this mutant to late endosomes was inhibited. These results support the view that the receptor kinase activity is important for ligand-induced sorting of EGF receptors to the pathway of lysosomal degradation."

Biochem. 52, 271): 1412-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and later substrates singly labeled with 13C (5Hill R.E. Miura I. Spenser I.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 4179-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), established the pattern of incorporation into the skeleton of pyridoxol (1; see Structure 1) of the carbon atoms of glycerol, glucose, and pyruvic acid. From these results it was inferred that pyridoxol is constructed from three glucose-derived triose phosphates, two of which enter intact, supplying the C3 fragments, C-3,4,4′ and C-6,5,5′ of pyridoxol, with the carbon atom holding the phosphate ester group yielding C-4′ and C-5′, while the third triose phosphate unit yields a C2 unit, by decarboxylation of pyruvate, whose CH3-CO moiety then supplies the C2 unit, C-2′,2, i.e. the CH3 group and the adjacent ring carbon of pyridoxol.We now furnish definitive proof that these inferences were indeed correct. This direct evidence comes from the results of incorporation studies with substrates labeled with 13C at contiguous sites, so called “bond-labeled” compounds, whose mode of incorporation into pyridoxol was determined by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR).The power of this method lies in the circumstance that, when contiguous carbon atoms within a compound are 100% enriched in 13C, this fact is indicated by the presence, within the 13C NMR spectrum of the compound, of 13C-13C coupling, which is indicated by the appearance of peaks that are not present in the spectrum of a natural abundance sample or of a singly 13C-enriched sample. These new peaks are detectable even if the fully 13C enriched sample is a minor component of a mixture that consists mainly of the unenriched compound.The appearance of peaks due to 13C-13C coupling, in the signals of the 13C NMR spectrum of a biosynthetic product, as a result of incorporation of contiguously 100%13C-13C-enriched (i.e. bond-labeled) substrates, provides direct evidence for the transfer from substrate into the biosynthetic product of an intact C-C unit. The application of bond-labeled samples thus constitutes a powerful tool for the demonstration of the transfer of intact multi-carbon fragments in biosynthetic investigations; provided adequate incorporation can be achieved in a tracer experiment with a 13C bond-labeled substrate, these are the tracers of choice. Neither radioactive tracer methods nor the use of substrates that are enriched with stable isotopes at single sites can show incorporation of intact multi-carbon units. Furthermore, 13C NMR does not only detect the site of labeling, but at the same time confirms the identity of the labeled sample and determines its degree of chemical purity. A precondition of the application of NMR methods for the analysis of biosynthetic incorporation patterns is the reliable assignment of each spectral signal to the individual atom that gives rise to it.Support for the inferences drawn from our tracer studies with 14C-labeled substrates, that the pyridoxine skeleton was constructed from three glucose-derived subunits, came from an experiment with [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]D-glucose (referred to as Experiment 1 in Table I) (6Hill R.E.

Experiment 4 served as a test of D-xylose as the general carbon source. This change in the general carbon source was made after consideration of the results of the D-glucose displacement experiments, Experiments 5 and 7, and after failure to observe 13C incorporation in an early experiment with [2,3-13C2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose. Whereas unlabeled 4-hydroxy-L-threonine completely suppressed the incorporation, into C-6,5,5′ of pyridoxol, of 13C from [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]-D-glucose (Experiment 7), unlabled 1-deoxy-D-xylulose only partially suppressed the incorporation, into C-2′,2,3,4,4′ of pyridoxol, of 13C from [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]-D-glucose (Experiment 5). Furthermore, in an experiment with [2,3-13C2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose in which D-glucose served as the general carbon source, no 13C enrichment was detectable in the pyridoxol that was isolated. We reasoned that these results may have been the consequence of an “inducer exclusion effect,” a phenomenon that occurs in bacterial systems, whereby certain carbohydrates (so-called “PTS-carbohydrates”), e.g. glucose, inhibit the transport and metabolism of other carbohydrates (so-called “class I non-PTS carbohydrates”) (PTS = phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system) (16) of which 1-deoxy-D-xululose might be one. We surmised that in our short term (6 h) incubations, D-glucose might have inhibited the uptake of 1-deoxy-D-xululose, whereas entry of the amino acid, 4-hydroxy-L-threonine, had not been affected. If this reasoning were correct, the problem might be overcome by using as the general carbon source in this experiment a non-PTS-carbohydrate such as D-xylose, in place of D-glucose, a PTS-carbohydrate.

Experiment 4 served as a test of D-xylose as the general carbon source. This change in the general carbon source was made after consideration of the results of the D-glucose displacement experiments, Experiments 5 and 7, and after failure to observe 13C incorporation in an early experiment with [2,3-13C2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose. Whereas unlabeled 4-hydroxy-L-threonine completely suppressed the incorporation, into C-6,5,5′ of pyridoxol, of 13C from [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]-D-glucose (Experiment 7), unlabled 1-deoxy-D-xylulose only partially suppressed the incorporation, into C-2′,2,3,4,4′ of pyridoxol, of 13C from [1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6]-D-glucose (Experiment 5). Furthermore, in an experiment with [2,3-13C2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose in which D-glucose served as the general carbon source, no 13C enrichment was detectable in the pyridoxol that was isolated. We reasoned that these results may have been the consequence of an “inducer exclusion effect,” a phenomenon that occurs in bacterial systems, whereby certain carbohydrates (so-called “PTS-carbohydrates”), e.g. glucose, inhibit the transport and metabolism of other carbohydrates (so-called “class I non-PTS carbohydrates”) (PTS = phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system) (16) of which 1-deoxy-D-xululose might be one. We surmised that in our short term (6 h) incubations, D-glucose might have inhibited the uptake of 1-deoxy-D-xululose, whereas entry of the amino acid, 4-hydroxy-L-threonine, had not been affected. If this reasoning were correct, the problem might be overcome by using as the general carbon source in this experiment a non-PTS-carbohydrate such as D-xylose, in place of D-glucose, a PTS-carbohydrate. Cultures of E. coli mutant WG2 were established on the minimal medium, with D-xylose as the general carbon source, and in a test experiment (Experiment 4) it was found that under these conditions incorporation of label from sodium [2,3-13C2]pyruvate matched the result obtained when D-glucose served as the general carbon source (Experiment 3). Having thereby established that D-xylose could replace D-glucose as the general carbon source without measurable impairment of pyridoxine biosynthesis, we proceeded with Experiments 6 and 9 (Table I).500 (3.3)a In Experiments 4, 6, and 9, D-xylose in place of D-glucose was used as the general carbon source in order to avert the possibility that the presence of glucose might limit the uptake and incorporation of the labeled carbohydrate substrates, [2,3-13C2]-1-deoxy-D-xylulose (Experiment 6) and [2,3-13C2]-D-erythroate (Experiment 9).

A sample of the amino acid was added since it was observed that this stimulates pyridoxol biosynthesis.c 4-Hydroxy-L-threonine shows antimetabolite properties in E. coli, inhibiting the growth of E. coli B when cultured on a pyridoxine-supplemented growth medium. Addition of L-threonine (20 mg/liter) permits the mutant to grow in the presence of the amounts of 4-hydroxy-L-threonine that were added to the medium in Experiments 6, 7, and 8 (100, 750, and 160 mg/liter, respectively).d Only three 1 liter cultures (rather than five) were employed in this experiment. Open table in a new tab The results of the tracer studies with 13C bond-labeled substrates that are here presented define more precisely the mode of incorporation of glucose carbon atoms into the glucose-derived subunits, C-2′,2, C-3,4,4′ and C-6,5,5′, of pyridoxol. They show, further, that an intact C2 unit, derived from C-3,2 of pyruvic acid, serves as the precursor of the C2-unit, C-2′,2, and that the C5 chain, C-2′,2,3,4,4′ of pyridoxol, originates by linear combination of the pyruvate-derived C2 unit and one of the glucose-derived C3 units. Furthermore, the results establish the identities of the two multicarbon precursors whose union accounts for the formation of the complete skeleton of pyridoxine. It is shown that 1-deoxy-D-xylulose (12) supplies the intact C5 chain, C-2′,2,3,4,4′, while the C3N unit, N-1,C-6,5,5′, is derived intact from 4-hydroxy-L-threonine (13), which is thereby proven to be an intermediate of the biosynthetic route. D-Erythroate (11) is shown to serve as an intermediate between glucose and 4-hydroxy-L-threonine. Preliminary reports of part of this work have appeared elsewhere (8Kennedy I.A. Hill R.E.

D-Glucose (Experiments 1-3, 5, 7, and 8) or D-xylose (Experiments 4, 6, and 9) served as the general carbon source. Pyridoxal hydrochloride was added to a concentration of 6 × 10−7 M when the minimal medium was used to grow the pdxH− mutant.All media were prepared in distilled water and were sterilized by autoclaving. The pyridoxal hydrochloride supplement solution was sterilized by filtration.Stock CulturesStock cultures of E. coli B WG2 were maintained on monthly slants of the nutrient broth medium. After subculturing from the previous month's stock, fresh slants were incubated 24 h at 37°C and were then stored at 4°C. Every time fresh stock slants were prepared, slants of minimal salts medium, with and without pyridoxal supplementation, were inoculated and incubated 24 h at 37°C in order to monitor for the presence of wild-type revertants.Labeled CompoundsThe following labeled compounds were acquired from a commercial source (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.

It is not yet clear what role DGPP plays in lipid metabolism and cell signaling, but it has been suggested that DGPP may function to attenuate the signaling functions of PA or may serve as a signaling molecule itself (3Munnik T. de Vrije T.

DGPP phosphatase has recently been purified to homogeneity from S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

When DGPP is supplied as a substrate in vitro, the enzyme removes the β phosphate of DGPP to generate PA and then removes the α phosphate to generate DG (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although DGPP phosphatase can also utilize PA as a substrate in the absence of DGPP, the enzyme has a 10-fold higher specificity constant for DGPP (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The PA phosphatase activity of the DGPP phosphatase enzyme is distinct from the conventional PA phosphatase enzyme (8Carman G.M. Zeimetz G.M. J. Biol.

Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The conventional PA phosphatase enzyme has a Mg2+ ion requirement and is sensitive to inhibition by NEM (19Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8641-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Morlock K.R. McLaughlin J.J. Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3586-3593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PA phosphatase activity of the DGPP phosphatase enzyme does not have a Mg2+ ion requirement and is insensitive to NEM (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Two forms of PA phosphatase activity exist in mammalian cells. The conventional form of the enzyme associates with the endoplasmic reticulum, has a Mg2+ ion requirement, is inhibited by NEM, and is responsible for the synthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (21Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other form of the enzyme is associated with the plasma membrane, does not have a Mg2+ ion requirement, is insensitive to NEM, and is thought to be involved in lipid signaling pathways (21Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A PA phosphatase activity has been identified from the membrane fraction of Escherichia coli (22Van den Bosch H. Vagelos P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 233-248Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and mutants defective in this activity have been isolated that are defined by the pgpB gene (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PA phosphatase activity in pgpB mutants has been measured using the assay conditions described for the conventional Mg2+-dependent PA phosphatase enzyme (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these assay conditions would not reveal the existence of a Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity such as that displayed by the DGPP phosphatase enzyme. With this in mind, we tested the hypothesis that E. coli possessed a Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity of a DGPP phosphatase enzyme. In this study we provided both genetic and biochemical evidence that the pgpB gene encoded for a DGPP phosphatase activity that can also utilize PA, lyso-PA, and phosphatidylglycerophosphate as substrates. All chemicals were reagent grade. Growth medium supplies were purchased from Difco. Radiochemicals and ENHANCE were from DuPont NEN. Scintillation counting supplies were from National Diagnostics. Nucleotides, glycerol 3-phosphate, NEM, Triton X-100, isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids and Sigma. Protein assay reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad. Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates were from EM Science. E. coli DG kinase was obtained from Lipidex Inc. The E. coli strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Strains CF10 and CF20 are mutants with disrupted alleles in the pgpA and pgpB genes, respectively (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain CF30 is a mutant with disrupted alleles in both the pgpA and pgpB genes (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pTI5-217 is a runaway replication plasmid that contains the pgpB gene under the control of a tac promoter (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in LB medium and maintained on LB agar. Growth media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) as needed. Cultures were grown to the exponential phase of growth at 30°C and then harvested by centrifugation. Strain JM103 bearing plasmid pTI5-217 was shifted to 37°C and incubated for 1 h to increase the plasmid copy number (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (2 mM) was then added to the growth medium to induce the expression of the pgpB gene product (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 1 h, the induced cells were harvested by centrifugation.TABLE I.E. coli strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeRelevant phenotypeRef.TI80AaIsogenic parent strain of CF10, CF20, and CF30.recA+ srl::Tn10Wild-type phosphatase activity25Funk C.R.

Cells were disrupted by sonic oscillation followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the membrane fraction. Membranes were washed, resuspended, and dialyzed with 50 mM Tris-maleate (pH 7.0) buffer containing 20% glycerol and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. These membranes were used as the source of DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities. S. cerevisiae DGPP phosphatase (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and C. roseus PA kinase (2Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were purified as described previously. DGPP standard and 32P-labeled (α-32P and β-32P) DGPP were synthesized enzymatically using purified C. roseus PA kinase as described by Wu et al. (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). [32P]PA and [32P]lyso-PA were synthesized enzymatically from DG and monoacylglycerol, respectively, using E. coli DG kinase (26Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (19Lin Y.-P. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DGPP phosphatase activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [β-32P]DGPP (5,000-10,000 cpm/nmol) or by following the formation of [32P]PA from [α-32P]DGPP (2,000-5,000 cpm/nmol) as described by Wu et al. (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1 mM DGPP, 2 mM Triton X-100, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The chloroform-soluble phospholipid product of the reaction, PA, was analyzed with standard PA and DGPP by thin-layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-treated plates using the solvent system chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:15:13:12:4) (4Wu W.-I Liu Y.

The positions of the labeled phospholipids on the chromatograms were determined by autoradiography. The amount of labeled phospholipids was determined by scintillation counting. PA phosphatase activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [32P]PA (10,000 cpm/nmol) (28Carman G.M. Lin Y.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM PA, 1 mM Triton X-100, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. PA phosphatase activity was also measured in a reaction mixture which included 2 mM MgCl2 and omitted Na2EDTA. Lyso-PA phosphatase activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble 32Pi from chloroform-soluble [32P]lyso-PA (20,000 cpm/nmol) (28Carman G.M. Lin Y.-P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 mM lyso-PA, 1 mM Triton X-100, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. PGP phosphatase activity was measured using a coupled enzyme assay where the PGP substrate of the reaction was generated by the PGP synthase reaction (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM [3H]glycerol 3-phosphate (40,000 cpm/nmol), 0.1 mM CDP-DG, 1.5 mM Triton X-100, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM NEM, 0.1 mg/ml E. coli strain CF30 membrane protein, and 10 pmol/min purified yeast DGPP phosphatase in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The chloroform-soluble phospholipid products of the reaction, PGP and PG, were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/water (50:30:4:8). The positions of the labeled phospholipids on the chromatograms were determined by fluorography. All enzyme assays were conducted at 30°C in triplicate. The average standard deviation of the assays was ±5%. The enzyme reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of product/min. Specific activity was defined as units/mg of protein. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The original E. coli pgpB mutant was isolated in a biochemical screen that was designed to isolate cells defective in PGP phosphatase activity (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has shown that pgpB mutant cells are also defective in PA phosphatase and lyso-PA phosphatase activities (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These mutant cells exhibit the greatest reduction in PA phosphatase activity (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined the levels of PA phosphatase activity in membranes derived from a well characterized mutant with a pgpB allele that has been disrupted by the insertion of an Ampr gene fragment (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant has the same properties as the original pgpB mutant (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We measured PA phosphatase activity in the presence of Mg2+ ions as described previously (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of PA phosphatase activity in the pgpB mutant was 75% lower than the activity found in its isogenic wild-type parent strain (Fig. 2A). We next examined if E. coli possessed a Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity. In these experiments, the reaction mixture also contained Na2EDTA, and the membranes used for the enzyme assays were dialyzed to remove divalent cations. Indeed, a Mg2+-independent activity was expressed in E. coli cells. Whether Mg2+ ions were present or not, the levels of PA phosphatase activity were similar in wild type cells and were reduced to the same extent in pgpB mutant cells (Fig. 2A). The pgpB gene has been cloned, sequenced, 2GenBank™ accession no. M23628. and shown to be the structural gene for the PA phosphatase activity defined by the pgpB mutation (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein product encoded by the pgpB gene is expressed at elevated levels in cells bearing the wild-type pgpB gene under the control of a tac promoter on a runaway replication plasmid (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells also overexpress PA phosphatase, lyso-PA phosphatase, and PGP phosphatase activities (24Icho T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5117-5124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of the pgpB gene product also resulted in elevated levels (370-fold) of the PA phosphatase activity that was measured in the absence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 2A). We next examined the levels of DGPP phosphatase activity. In wild-type cells, the specific activity of DGPP phosphatase (Fig. 2B) was approximately 6-fold greater than that of the PA phosphatase activities measured in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions (Fig. 2A). DGPP phosphatase activity was not detected in pgpB mutant cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the specific activity of DGPP phosphatase from cells that overexpress the pgpB gene product was 310-fold greater than that found in wild-type cells (Fig. 2B). A pgpA mutant was isolated in the same biochemical screen that identified the pgpB mutant (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant exhibits a defect in PGP phosphatase activity, while PA phosphatase and lyso-PA phosphatase activities are present at wild-type levels (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We examined PA phosphatase (measured in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions) and DGPP phosphatase activities in a mutant in which the pgpA gene was disrupted (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant has the same properties as the original pgpA mutant (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of PA phosphatase (Fig. 2A) and DGPP phosphatase (Fig. 2B) activities from pgpA mutant cells were the same as that from its isogenic wild-type parent (Fig. 2B). The membrane fraction of strain JM103/pTI5-217 was used for the characterization of DGPP phosphatase and Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activities. The elevated expression of the pgpB gene product from these cells represents a considerable enrichment of these activities that is equivalent to a nearly 600-fold purification over that expressed in the cell extract of wild-type E. coli. We examined the thermolability of DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities. Membranes were heated at 50°C, and samples were removed at various time intervals. DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities were then measured at 30°C under standard assay conditions. In this experiment, DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities were inactivated with identical kinetics (Fig. 3). A t1/2 of 55 s for the inactivation of both phosphatase activities was calculated from a replot of the log activity versus time of incubation (Fig. 3). The time dependence of the DGPP phosphatase reaction was examined using [α-32P]DGPP as the substrate (Fig. 4). By using the α-labeled substrate we could distinguish the removal of the β phosphate of DGPP from the removal of the pyrophosphate moiety of DGPP. The water-soluble fraction of the reaction was also analyzed. DGPP phosphatase catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the β phosphate of DGPP, and after an initial lag period, catalyzed the dephosphorylation of the α phosphate of DGPP (Fig. 4B). Thus, DGPP phosphatase dephosphorylated DGPP to PA and subsequently dephosphorylated PA to DG. The kinetics of activity toward DGPP and PA were examined using Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles. This mixed micellar system allows the analysis of lipid-dependent enzymes using surface dilution kinetics, a model system which mimics the physiological surface of the membrane (30Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Positive cooperative kinetics were exhibited with respect to the surface concentration of DGPP (Fig. 5). The data were analyzed according to the Hill equation using the EZ-FIT Enzyme Kinetic Model Fitting Program (31Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This analysis yielded a Hill number of 1.45, a Km value for DGPP of 2.3 mol %, and a Vmax value of 2,167 nmol/min/mg. Positive cooperative kinetics were also exhibited with respect to the surface concentration of PA (Fig. 5). Analysis of this data according to the Hill equation gave a Hill number of 3.9, a Km value for PA of 3.1 mol %, and a Vmax value of 313 nmol/min/mg. The specificity constants (Vmax/Km) for DGPP and PA were 942 and 101, respectively. Maximum DGPP phosphatase activity was observed at pH 6.5 (Fig. 6). DGPP phosphatase activity was independent of any divalent cation requirement and was stimulated (35%) by 2 mM Na2EDTA. DGPP phosphatase activity was not significantly affected by the addition of 5 mM NEM to the assay system. The addition of Mn2+ ions to the assay resulted in a dose-dependent inactivation of DGPP phosphatase activity (Fig. 7). This inactivation followed positive cooperative kinetics (Hill number of 3) and the IC50 value for MnCl2 was calculated to be 34 μM. PA phosphatase activity was also inhibited by Mn2+ ions (data not shown). Furthermore, the Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity was stimulated (25%) by 2 mM Na2EDTA and was not significantly affected by 5 mM NEM. The addition of 1 mM MnCl2 to the assay systems for DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase (measured in the presence or absence of Mg2+ ions) resulted in the total inhibition of all three activities in wild-type cells, in cells that overproduced the pgpB gene product, and in pgpA mutant cells (data not shown).Fig. 7Effect of MnCl2 on DGPP phosphatase activity. DGPP phosphatase activity from membranes derived from strain JM103/pTI5-217 was measured in the absence and presence of the indicated concentrations of MnCl2. The inset is a replot of the MnCl2-mediated inhibition of DGPP phosphatase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the ability of the pgpB gene product to utilize DGPP, PA, lyso-PA, and PGP as substrates, we examined the ability of pure DGPP phosphatase from S. cerevisiae to utilize lyso-PA and PGP as substrates. Lyso-PA phosphatase activity was measured by following the dephosphorylation of [32P]lyso-PA under the optimum assay conditions for DGPP phosphatase activity (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The yeast DGPP phosphatase enzyme catalyzed the dephosphorylation of lyso-PA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8). The enzyme exhibited positive cooperative kinetic behavior toward the surface concentration of lyso-PA (Hill number of 1.5). The Km and Vmax values for the reaction were calculated according to the Hill equation to be 0.74 mol % and 167 μmol/min/mg. The PGP phosphatase activity of yeast DGPP phosphatase was measured by a coupled enzyme assay using PGP synthase activity to generate the PGP substrate for the reaction. Membranes from E. coli strain CF30 were used as the source of PGP synthase. This strain contains disrupted alleles in both the pgpA and pgpB genes and is partially defective in PGP phosphatase activity (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the PGP synthesized via the PGP synthase reaction accumulates and can be used for the reaction catalyzed by the yeast DGPP phosphatase. The yeast DGPP phosphatase was incubated with CDP-DG, [3H]glycerol-3-phosphate, and the E. coli membranes. Following incubation, the chloroform-soluble products of the reaction were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. In this experiment, yeast DGPP phosphatase catalyzed a time-dependent reaction utilizing the PGP generated in the PGP synthase reaction for the synthesis of PG (Fig. 9). In this study we tested the hypothesis that the E. coli pgpB gene encoded a DGPP phosphatase activity. The product of the pgpB gene is a 28-kDa membrane-associated enzyme which has the ability to dephosphorylate PA, lyso-PA, and PGP in vitro (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We questioned whether the PA phosphatase activity defined by the pgpB gene (23Icho T. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 722-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was in fact a Mg2+-independent activity of the DGPP phosphatase enzyme similar to the activity characterized in S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We showed that E. coli possessed a PA phosphatase activity that was independent of any Mg2+ ion requirement and was insensitive to inhibition by NEM. The expression of the Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity was reduced in pgpB mutant cells and elevated in cells overexpressing the wild-type pgpB gene. A residual amount of PA phosphatase activity was present in the pgpB mutant indicating that the pgpB gene product was not the only source of PA phosphatase activity in E. coli. DGPP phosphatase activity was present in E. coli and its expression was not detected in the pgpB mutant. Thus, the lack of DGPP phosphatase activity was the most pronounced phenotype of the pgpB gene. Our data indicated that the DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities were due to a single enzyme. DGPP phosphatase activity was overproduced in cells overexpressing the pgpB gene product and the extent of its overproduction paralleled that of the Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity. Both activities were inhibited by Mn2+ ions and were insensitive to inhibition by NEM. In addition, DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities exhibited the same kinetics of temperature inactivation. The substrate dependence experiments demonstrated that DGPP was a better substrate for the enzyme when compared with PA. The specificity constant for DGPP was 9.3-fold higher than that for PA. In addition, the enzyme exhibited greater cooperative kinetic behavior toward PA when compared with DGPP. This substrate preference was consistent with the elevated DGPP phosphatase activity relative to the PA phosphatase activity found in the various E. coli strains. The enzymological properties (e.g. dephosphorylation of the β phosphate of DGPP followed by the dephosphorylation of the α phosphate of DGPP, pH optimum, stimulation by Na2EDTA, inhibition by Mn2+ ions, and insensitivity to NEM) of the E. coli DGPP phosphatase were similar to those described for the enzyme from S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Moreover, the yeast DGPP phosphatase was similar to the E. coli enzyme with respect to the utilization of lyso-PA and PGP as substrates in vitro. PA phosphatase enzymes have been purified from rat liver (32Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) share properties that are strikingly similar to those of the PA phosphatase activity of the DGPP phosphatase enzymes from S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and E. coli. For example, the mammalian enzymes do not have a Mg2+ ion requirement, they are insensitive to inhibition by NEM, and they are inhibited by Mn2+ ions (32Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19422-19429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Fleming I.N. Yeaman S.J. Biochem.

In addition, the rat liver Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase, like the DGPP phosphatase enzymes from S. cerevisiae and E. coli, can utilize lyso-PA as a substrate in vitro (35Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether this rat liver Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase can utilize DGPP as a substrate. The rat liver Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase also utilizes ceramide 1-phosphate and sphingosine 1-phosphate as substrates in vitro (35Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These lipid phosphate compounds as well as PA and lyso-PA have been shown to be mediators of cell activation and signal transduction in mammalian cells (17Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12949-12952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 36Divecha N. Irvine R.F.

Milstien S. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 146: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the rat liver Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase may play a role in regulating the balance of these lipid mediators (35Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the rat liver Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase utilizes all of these substrates in vivo. Similarly, it is unclear whether the DGPP phosphatase enzymes from S. cerevisiae and E. coli utilize all of their respective substrates in vivo. It is known that the PGP phosphatase activity encoded by the E. coli pgpB gene product is not essential for the synthesis of PG in vivo (25Funk C.R. Zimniak L. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 205-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An understanding of the function of DGPP in phospholipid metabolism and cell signaling will require a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches. This will require the cloning of those genes that encode enzymes involved in DGPP metabolism and the purification and characterization of the products of these genes. Our laboratories have initiated these studies by purifying a PA kinase from plants (2Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and purifying a DGPP phosphatase from S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we have identified PA kinase activities in S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y.

Carman, unpublished data. and are developing methods for their purification. The finding of DGPP phosphatase and PA kinase activities in S. cerevisiae (4Wu W.-I Liu Y. Riedel B. Wissing J.B. Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1868-1876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and E. coli suggests a potential role of DGPP metabolism in these organisms that may be similar to that described in plants (3Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The identification of the pgpB gene as the gene encoding for a DGPP phosphatase in E. coli should facilitate genetic and molecular studies aimed at gaining an understanding of the role(s) of DGPP metabolism in E. coli and may also facilitate the isolation of genes encoding for DGPP phosphatase from eukaryotic organisms.

To measure the kinetics of protein-DNA interactions in real time, changes in tryptophan fluorescence in the polymerase and 2-aminopurine (2-AP) fluorescence in the promoter DNA upon binary complex formation were used as probes. The protein fluorescence changes measured conformational changes in the polymerase whereas the fluorescence changes of 2-AP base, substituted in place of dA in the initiation region (−4 to +4), measured structural changes in the promoter DNA, such as DNA melting. The kinetic studies, carried out in the absence of the initiating nucleotide, are consistent with a two-step DNA binding mechanism, E+D⇄K1EDa⇄k−2k2EDb where the RNA polymerase forms an initial weak EDa complex rapidly with an equilibrium association constant K1. The EDa complex then undergoes a conformational change to EDb, wherein RNA polymerase is specifically and tightly bound to the promoter DNA. Both the polymerase and the promoter DNA may undergo structural changes during this isomerization step. The isomerization of EDa to EDb is a fast step relative to the rate of transcription initiation and its rate does not limit transcription initiation. To understand how T7 RNA polymerase modulates its transcriptional efficiency at various promoters at the level of DNA binding, comparative studies with two natural T7 promoters, Φ10 and Φ3.8, were conducted. The results indicate that kinetics, the bimolecular rate constant of DNA binding, kon (K1k2), and the dissociation rate constant, koff (k−2), and thermodynamics, the equilibrium constants of the two steps (K1 and k2/k−2) both play a role in modulating the transcriptional efficiency at the level of DNA binding.

Bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase is a 98-kDa single subunit polymerase that catalyzes synthesis of RNA complementary in sequence to the template DNA (1Chamberlin, M. J., Ryan, T., (1983) The Enzymes, (Boyer, P. D., ed), Vol. 15, pp. 87–108, Academic Press, New York.Google Scholar). The phage enzymes are among the simplest RNA polymerases known, as no accessory proteins are necessary for specific initiation, elongation, or termination of transcription (2Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 3Kotani H. Ishizaki Y. Hiraoka N. Obayashi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2653-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 17 promoters of bacteriophage T7 direct specific initiation of RNA synthesis that occurs in a rapid and processive manner (4Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2690-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Ikeda R.A. Lin A.C. Clarke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2640-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to their simplicity these enzymes serve as model systems to understand, in depth, the mechanisms of transcription initiation, elongation, or termination. Initiation of transcription occurs by recognition and binding of the RNA polymerase to a promoter DNA sequence. This event is recognized as one of the important steps at which transcription and gene expression is regulated. The 17 bacteriophage T7 promoters share consensus sequence from −17 to +6 position relative to the transcription start site at +1 (6Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The class III gene promoters of T7 are absolutely conserved in DNA sequence, whereas the class II gene promoters differ at a number of positions within the consensus sequence. The sequence of the promoter DNA is a primary factor that determines the strength of the promoter and the efficiency of initiation. However, the relationship between promoter DNA sequence and transcriptional efficiency is not well understood at the mechanistic level. In general, the detailed kinetics and thermodynamics of transcription are less well understood, in part, due to its complexity. The T7 promoters and the phage RNA polymerase, owing to their simplicity, should serve as a good starting model to understand the mechanism and regulation of transcription in greater detail. The present study consists of the kinetic and thermodynamic investigations of the steps involved in promoter recognition and DNA binding. The interaction of the RNA polymerase with its promoter DNAs has not been examined previously using fast kinetic methods. Since DNA binding is a fast step, it is necessary to use rapid kinetic methods to directly observe intermediate binary species that accumulate transiently during initiation. The stopped-flow methods used in this study allow us to elucidate the mechanism of DNA binding and to determine the rate and equilibrium constants of steps leading to intermediate species. To examine DNA binding in real time we use the change in the intrinsic fluorescence of protein upon promoter binding as a signal. In addition, we have taken advantage of the fluorescent properties of 2-aminopurine (2-AP) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-AP2-aminopurinedsdouble-stranded. base, an analog of dA, which can be incorporated into the promoter DNAs and used as a probe to monitor promoter opening in real time. The present studies have been carried out in the absence of the NTP substrate. Comparative studies with two natural T7 promoters, Φ10 and Φ3.8, representing strong class III and weak class II promoters, respectively, provide insights into the mechanism by which T7 RNA polymerase regulates its transcriptional efficiency at the level of DNA binding. 2-aminopurine double-stranded. T7 RNA polymerase was purified from the Escherichia coli BL21/pAR1219 cell line (kindly provided by Alan Rosenberg and Bill Studier, Brookhaven National Laboratories) (2Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). The enzyme was >95% pure after three chromatography columns consisting of SP-Sephadex, CM-Sephadex, and DEAE-Sephacel purchased from Sigma (7Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1245-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The polymerase was stored in 50% glycerol, and buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.7), 1 mM trisodium EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl at −80°C. The concentration of the polymerase was determined by absorbance measurement at 280 nm and from its molar extinction coefficient of 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (8King G.C. Martin C.T. Pham T.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The DNA promoters were synthesized on a Millipore Nucleic Acid synthesis system 899. DMT-deoxynucleoside (benzoyl or isobutyryl) β-cyanoethylphosphoramidites were purchased from PerSeptive Biosystems. 2-Aminopurine CE phosphoramidite and Ac-dC-CE phosphoramidite were purchased from Glen Research Corp. Ac-dC-CE phosphoramidite was used for dC incorporation in 2-AP DNA. Coupling time of 15 min for 2-AP base incorporation and ultrafast cleavage and deprotection systems were used for the synthesis of 2-AP containing DNAs (deprotection was performed with a mixture of equal volumes of ammonium hydroxide and 40% methylamine aqueous solution, following the procedure provided by Glen Research). 2-AP base was incorporated at position −3, −1, and +4 for Φ10 and Φ3.8 nontemplate strands, position −4 and −2 for Φ10 template strand, and position −4 for the Φ3.8 template strand (Fig. 1). All synthetic promoters used in this study were purified on 16% polyacrylamide, 5 M urea gels. The DNA was visualized by UV shadowing, and electroeluted from the gel using an Elutrap apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell). The concentration of purified DNA was determined by absorbance measurement at 260 nm using the following extinction coefficients (M−1 cm−1) for the bases: dA, 15,200; dC, 7050; dG, 12,010; dT, 8400. The extinction coefficient of 2-AP, at 260 nm, equal to 1000 M−1 cm−1 was used in the calculation of 2-AP DNA concentration (9Fox J.J. Wempen I. Hampton A. Doerr I.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1669-1675Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The double-stranded (ds) DNAs were prepared by annealing the individual single-stranded DNA strands. The exact ratio of the two single-stranded DNA strands to prepare the dsDNAs was determined routinely from titration experiments performed on an 18% native polyacrylamide gel that resolves dsDNA from the single-stranded DNAs. The fluorimetric titration experiments were performed on a Perkin Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer. The emission spectra of 2-AP containing DNAs were obtained by excitation at 315 nm (excitation slit width = 5 nm, and emission slit width = 5 nm). Fluorimetric titration experiments were performed in the reaction buffer (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% Tween 20) at 25°C. The fluorescence changes recorded in all these experiments are an average of 5 measurements which were taken after at least 1 min of incubation when the readings no longer changed. A constant amount of 2-AP dsDNA (0.05 μM) was titrated against increasing concentration of T7 RNA polymerase. A control experiment was carried out in the presence of normal DNA (0.05 μM) and increasing amounts of the polymerase, and the spectra were subtracted from the above to obtain fluorescence changes due to polymerase·2-AP DNA complex formation. The stopped-flow instrument from KinTek Corp. (State College, PA) was used to measure the DNA binding kinetics. Equal volumes of protein and DNA in buffer (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 5 mM dithiothreitol) from separate syringes were rapidly mixed in the stopped-flow instrument at 25°C. Changes in fluorescence emission of the protein were measured using a cut-on long pass filter >348 nm (Oriel Corp., catalog number 51260) after excitation at 290 nm (1-mm slits). 2-AP fluorescence emission was measured using a cut-on filter >360 nm (WG360, Hi-Tech Scientific, serial number 273129), after excitation at 315 nm (1-5 mm slit width). About 5-10 kinetic traces for 2-AP DNAs and 20-30 for normal DNAs were routinely averaged for each experiment. The equilibrium binding and kinetic data were fit using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) or KaleidaGraph (Abelbeck) softwares. Stopped-flow kinetic traces were fit using the KinTek stopped-flow kinetic program software to single or sum of exponential as in the equation, F = Σ An× exp(-kobs,nt) + C, where F is the fluorescence at time t, n is the number of exponential terms, An and kobs,n are the amplitude and the observed rate constant of the nth term, respectively, and C is the fluorescence intensity at t = 0. The error bars for kobs values shown in the Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 represent errors in the fit. The errors shown for the rate constants represents the mean of deviation of the reported rate constants from the values computed from the maximum and minimum kobs values.Fig. 7The 2-APΦ10 and 2-APΦ3.8 dsDNA binding as a function of [RNA polymerase]. The stopped-flow kinetic experiments described in Fig. 6, a and b, were measured at increasing [polymerase]. The first-order rate constants obtained from single exponential fit, increased linearly with increasing [polymerase] for both 2-APΦ10 (a) and 2-APΦ3.8 (b) dsDNAs. The slopes and the intercepts provided the kon and koff values of 65 ± 8 μM−1 s−1 and 3.4 ± 0.4 s−1 for 2-APΦ10 dsDNA; and 84 ± 9 μM−1 s−1, 8.7 ± 0.3 s−1 for 2-APΦ3.8 dsDNA. This translates into Kd values of 0.052 ± 0.013 and 0.104 ± 0.010 μM for 2-APΦ10 and 2-APΦ3.8 DNAs, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6Stopped-flow kinetics of RNA polymerase binding to 2-APΦ10 and 2-APΦ3.8 dsDNAs. The stopped-flow kinetics of polymerase binding to 2-AP DNAs were measured at 25°C by exciting the 2-AP DNAs at 315 nm and measuring emission at >360 nm. Each kinetic trace shown is an average of 5-10 measurements. The kinetics of 2-APΦ10 (a) and 2-APΦ3.8 (b) binding under the conditions of excess polymerase (0.3 μM) over DNA (0.05 μM) fit to a single exponential. The kinetics of 2-APΦ10 (a) fit to a first-order rate constant of 19.3 ± 1.6 s−1; and 2-APΦ3.8 (b) to 28.9 ± 1.4 s−1. The kinetics of 2-APΦ10 (c) and 2-APΦ3.8 (d) binding under the conditions of excess DNA (0.3 μM) over polymerase (0.05 μM) were biphasic and fit to the sum of exponentials. The rate constants for the fast phase were comparable in value to the rate constants observed in a and b. The kinetics of 2-APΦ10 DNA (c) fit to a first-order rate constant of 17.7 ± 1.1 s−1, and the 2-APΦ3.8 DNA (d) to 35.5 ± 2.5 s−1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Studies in the literature (10Suh W.-C.

We studied the equilibrium and kinetic interactions between T7 RNA polymerase and T7 promoters with the goal of dissecting the steps involved in the process of promoter recognition during transcription initiation. The kinetics of DNA binding were measured using stopped-flow methods. The decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence that results upon promoter-polymerase binary complex formation was used as the probe for kinetic measurements. To investigate the kinetics of promoter opening, 2-AP containing promoter DNAs were prepared. 2-AP is a fluorescent base analog of dA that base pairs with dT. The fluorescence of 2-AP is sensitive to local changes that result from melting of dsDNA (9Fox J.J. Wempen I. Hampton A. Doerr I.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 1669-1675Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 14Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 1228-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Millar D.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This is evident from the fluorescence spectra in Fig. 2, a and b, which shows the 2-4-fold higher fluorescence of 2-AP in the single-stranded DNA form versus the dsDNA form. Both DNA binding and DNA melting during transcription initiation should be observable in real time by following the change in fluorescence of 2-AP DNA promoters. The consensus sequence recognized by T7 RNA polymerase consists of bases in the region −17 to +6 relative to the transcription start site at +1 (16Chamberlin M. McGrath J. Waskell L. Nature. 1970; 228: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 17Oakley J.L. Strothkamp R.E. Sarris A.H. Coleman J.E.

We have synthesized promoter DNAs, 40-base pairs in length, containing the natural Φ10 and Φ3.8 sequences from positions −21 to +19 (Fig. 1). The sequence of Φ10, a class III promoter, is absolutely conserved whereas the sequence of Φ3.8, a class II promoter, differs at several positions (−2, −11, −12, and −13) from the consensus sequence. We compare here the equilibrium and kinetic interactions of these two promoters to better understand how transcriptional efficiency is regulated at the DNA binding steps during initiation. Fluorescent promoter DNAs were chemically synthesized by incorporating 2-AP bases in place of dA bases in both the template and the nontemplate DNA strands in the region between −4 and +4 (Fig. 1). We chose to incorporate the 2-AP bases in this region because the region −6 to +2 has been shown (19Osterman H.L. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4884-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3306-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) to be in the single-stranded form in the open binary complex. The fluorescence of 2-AP bases at those positions should be sensitive to changes in DNA structure, such as DNA melting that occurs during initiation. Changing the dA bases to 2-AP at those positions does not affect transcription initiation. The steady state and pre-steady state kinetics of 2-mer to 19-mer RNA product formation were the same with the 2-AP-modified versus the unmodified promoters (data not shown). We have also synthesized partially dsDNA promoters that contain single-stranded template region from −5 onward as mimics of open promoter DNAs (Fig. 1). Binding of T7 RNA polymerase to 2-AP modified promoter DNAs resulted in about 6-7-fold enhancement in 2-AP-DNA fluorescence, as shown in Fig. 2, a and b. This increase in fluorescence is greater than the expected change from simply melting the duplex DNA. Therefore, at least a part of the increase in fluorescence appears to be due to the interaction of the DNA with the protein active site. The increase in 2-AP DNA fluorescence change upon binary complex formation was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of Φ10 and Φ3.8 promoters. The fluorimetric titrations were carried out at constant [DNA] and increasing [polymerase] at 25°C. The 2-AP DNA was excited at 315 nm (to minimize protein absorption) and emission was measured at 370 nm. The final equilibrium binding isotherms were obtained by subtracting the fluorescence of protein. The binding isotherms were fit to a hyperbola (Fig. 3, a and b) to calculate the apparent Kd values. The measured Kd values for Φ10 and Φ3.8 were 0.015 (±0.002) and 0.035 (±0.009) μM, respectively. The Φ10 promoter DNA therefore binds to the polymerase more strongly than the Φ3.8 promoter. The kinetic mechanism of RNA polymerase binding to DNA was investigated using the stopped-flow method. The binding of Φ10 and Φ3.8 promoter DNAs to the polymerase leads to quenching of protein tryptophan fluorescence. This intrinsic change in protein fluorescence was used to measure the kinetics of DNA binding, under conditions of excess polymerase over DNA as well as excess DNA over polymerase. Except for an extra kinetic phase under excess DNA conditions, the kinetics under the two conditions were comparable. Fig. 4 shows representative kinetic traces under excess [DNA] conditions, where 0.3 μM Φ10 DNA (Fig. 4a) or Φ3.8 DNA (Fig. 4b) was mixed with 0.05 μM polymerase. The kinetics fit best to two exponentials. To elucidate the mechanism of DNA binding and determine the bimolecular rate constant of DNA binding, the kinetics were measured as a function of increasing [DNA]. As shown in Fig. 5, a and b, the observed rate constant (kobs) of the fast phase increased linearly with increasing [DNA]. If DNA binding occurred with a simple one-step mechanism: E+D⇄koffkonEDREACTION 1 then, kobs = kon[S] + koff, where S is DNA or polymerase, E. The slope of kobs versus [DNA] provided the bimolecular rate constant, kon, and the intercept provided the dissociation rate constant, koff (21Johnson, K. A., (1992) The Enzymes, (Singman, D. S., ed), 3rd Ed., Vol. 20, pp. 1–61, Academic Press, Orlando, FL.Google Scholar). DNA binding is most likely a multistep process. Therefore, the derived kon and koff are macroscopic rate constants that describe the overall kinetics of DNA binding and dissociation and do not necessarily represent the intrinsic rate constants. The stopped-flow kinetic results show that Φ10 dsDNA promoter binds to the polymerase with a kon of 72 ± 7 μM−1 s−1 (slope), and dissociates from the binary complex with a koff of 4.0 ± 0.3 s−1 (intercept). The Φ3.8 dsDNA promoter binds to the polymerase with about 2-fold slower kon (42 ± 4 μM−1 s−1) and also dissociates faster from the complex with a 4-fold higher koff (17.7 ± 1.0 s−1). Control experiments with a dsDNA containing a non-promoter DNA sequence (Fig. 1), that is a DNA with random sequence, showed no measurable fluorescence changes confirming that the above rate constants measure specific interactions of the polymerase with the respective promoter sequences. The presence of a second slow phase in the DNA binding kinetics (Fig. 4) suggested a second step in the DNA binding mechanism (21Johnson, K. A., (1992) The Enzymes, (Singman, D. S., ed), 3rd Ed., Vol. 20, pp. 1–61, Academic Press, Orlando, FL.Google Scholar). Curiously, this slow phase was observed only when [DNA] was in excess of the polymerase. In addition, the observed rate constant of the second phase decreased with increasing [DNA] (Fig. 5, c and d). Both of these results suggest the presence of a conformational change before DNA binding, as shown in Reaction R2. The proposed conformational change is most likely a change in the polymerase, since biphasic kinetics were not observed when the polymerase concentration was in excess of the promoter DNA. E'⇄k−1k1E;E+D⇄KdEDReaction 2 According to mechanism (Reaction R2), the RNA polymerase exists in two conformations, E′ and E. The polymerase, E, is competent for DNA binding whereas polymerase, E′, needs to undergo a conformational change in order to bind DNA. k1 and k−1 represent the forward and reverse rate constants of the conformational change, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the binary complex ED. The rate constant of the second phase decreased with increasing [DNA] because of the following relationship between the observed rate constant and [DNA] (22Fersht A.R. Requena Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 60: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). kobs=k1+k−1×KdKd+[DNA](Eq.1) At very low [DNA], the observed rate constant will be close to k1+ k−1, whereas at very high [DNA], the observed rate will plateau at k1. Thus, Reaction R3 predicts that the observed rate constant will decrease from the sum of the rate constants (k1+ k−1) to k1 with increasing [DNA]. This is clearly the case with the Φ3.8 promoter as shown in Fig. 5d. In case of the Φ10 promoter, the decrease is small (Fig. 5c). This is both because of the tighter Kd of Φ10 DNA relative to Φ3.8, and since the kinetics were not measured at very low [DNA]. The nature of this slow conformational change in the polymerase required for DNA binding is not known. It may represent movement of one of the polymerase domains such as the thumb region that has been postulated to be flexible and involved in DNA binding (23Sousa R. Rose J. Wang B.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Judging from the relative amplitudes of the fluorescence changes in the kinetic experiments, we estimate that E′ represents about 30% of the population of RNA polymerase. Thus, approximately 70% of the RNA polymerase is in a conformation that binds DNA with fast kinetics. The rest of the discussion in this paper is concerned with the kinetics of the fast form of the polymerase. To measure the kinetics of DNA melting, the stopped-flow experiments were repeated with the 2-AP-modified promoter DNAs. The binding of 2-AP promoter DNAs to the polymerase resulted in a time-dependent increase in 2-AP DNA fluorescence (Fig. 6). Similar to the results with the non-fluorescent DNAs, the kinetics of DNA binding at excess [polymerase] were monophasic, whereas the kinetics at excess [DNA] were multiphasic. Fig. 6, a and b, show some of the stopped-flow kinetic traces resulting from 2-APΦ10 and 2-APΦ3.8 DNA binding under the conditions of excess [polymerase] (0.3 μM) over the [DNA] (0.05 μM). Similarly, Fig. 6, c and d, show the multiphasic kinetics under conditions of excess [DNA] (0.3 μM) over [polymerase] (0.05 μM). The observed rate constants of the fast phase were comparable under both conditions. To investigate the steps involved in DNA binding and to measure their rate constants, the stopped-flow kinetics of 2-AP DNA binding were measured at increasing [polymerase]. The kinetics fit best to a single exponential and as shown in Fig. 7, a and b, the observed rate constants increased linearly as a function of [polymerase], analogous to the dependence measured by protein fluorescence change. Both protein and DNA fluorescence changes therefore appear to measure essentially the same process. The kon and koff rate constants (Table I) for 2-APΦ10 are 65 ± 8 μM−1 s−1 and 3.4 ± 0.4 s−1, respectively, and these are also comparable to those obtained from protein fluorescence changes. The kon (84 ± 9 μM−1 s−1) and koff (8.7 ± 0.3 s−1) rate constants of 2-APΦ3.8 are about 2-fold different from those of the non-fluorescent Φ3.8 DNA. The 2-AP modification does not affect the DNA binding kinetics of Φ10 promoter, but it seems to affect the kinetics of Φ3.8 promoter to a small extent. No separate phase due to DNA melting was observed. Thus, if the increase in 2-AP fluorescence measures DNA melting, this step is fast and appears to occur concomitant with DNA binding. The second slow phase observed under excess [DNA] conditions is due to the population of RNA polymerase that binds DNA with slower kinetics, since the observed rate constants of the slow phase decreased with [DNA].TABLE I.Kinetic constants of T7 RNAP binding to T7 promotersPromoterkonkoffkoff/kon = KdKdaμm−1·s−1s−1μmμmΦ1072 ± 74.0 ± 0.30.055 ± 0.0102APΦ1065 ± 83.4 ± 0.40.052 ± 0.0130.015 ± 0.002Φ10-17/40364 ± 280.02 ± 0.60.000055 ± 0.0022APΦ10-17/40329 ± 470.1 ± 1.70.0003 ± 0.006Φ3.842 ± 417.7 ± 1.00.421 ± 0.0222APΦ3.884 ± 98.7 ± 0.30.104 ± 0.0100.035 ± 0.009Φ3.8-17/40312 ± 375.6 ± 0.60.018 ± 0.00452APΦ3.8-17/40423 ± 437.7 ± 0.40.018 ± 0.001a Equilibrium constant from fluorimetric titrations. Open table in a new tab a Equilibrium constant from fluorimetric titrations. Measurement of the kinetic rate constants also provides an estimate of equilibrium constants such as Kd, (Kd = koff/kon) which provides the strength of the binary complex. Consistent with the Kd values obtained from the equilibrium fluorescence titrations (Table I), the Kd value for the 2-AP modified Φ3.8 DNA was about 2-fold higher relative to the Φ10 promoter. The equilibrium Kd values measured from the fluorimetric titrations are, however, lower than those derived from the kinetic rate constants. The different Kd values from the two methods suggest the presence of an additional step after the bimolecular DNA binding step. This step must be very slow since it was not observed by stopped-flow kinetic measurements. Additional studies need to be carried out to understand the differences in the Kd values by the two methods. To further understand the process of open binary complex formation, the kinetics of polymerase binding to partially dsDNA promoters were investigated. These promoters are double-stranded in the promoter binding region (−21 to −5), but they mimic open promoters because the template DNA in the initiation and coding regions (from −5 onward) is single-stranded. The DNA binding kinetics were measured by following both the protein fluorescence change and the 2-AP fluorescence change in the DNA. As with the fully dsDNA promoters, binding of partially dsDNA to the polymerase resulted in a decrease in protein fluorescence and an increase in 2-AP DNA fluorescence (data not shown). The kinetics of DNA binding under all conditions, excess [polymerase] or excess [DNA], fit to a single exponential. The absence of the second slow phase suggested that both E and E′ forms of the polymerase in the proposed mechanism (Reaction R1) were capable of binding the partially dsDNAs. The kon and koff values were derived from the slopes and the intercepts of the linear increases in the observed rate constant versus [DNA] or [polymerase] (Table I). Interestingly, the partially dsDNAs bind to the polymerase with much higher kon and dissociate with much lower koff values relative to the fully dsDNAs. For instance, the partially ds Φ10 DNA binds with a 5-fold higher kon, and a 30-200-fold lower koff relative to the fully dsDNA (Table I). Similarly, the partially ds Φ3.8 DNAs bind with a 5-fold higher kon, but the koff values are 2-3-fold lower than those of the fully dsDNA. We have investigated the equilibrium and kinetic interactions between T7 promoters and T7 RNA polymerase to dissect the steps in the mechanism of DNA binding during initiation of transcription. The polymerase-DNA binary complex formation was quantitated by following both the decrease in protein tryptophan fluorescence and the increase in 2-AP DNA fluorescence. Since the fluorescence of 2-AP dsDNA increases upon DNA melting, this change was used to probe the kinetics of promoter opening. The 2-AP base was introduced in place of dA bases in the region shown to be in the open form during initiation (19Osterman H.L. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4884-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3306-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Replacement of dA bases with 2-AP in this region did not affect transcription initiation, since the measured steady state and pre-steady state kinetics of 2-mer to 19-mer RNA formation with 2-AP-modified DNAs as templates were comparable to those with the unmodified DNAs. We compare here the mechanism of polymerase binding to two natural T7 promoters: Φ10, a strong class III promoter, and Φ3.8, a weaker class II promoter that has base changes at positions −2, −11, −12, −13 from the consensus sequence. The base changes in class II promoters affect their efficiency of transcription, however, the regulatory mechanisms are unclear. There are several ways by which transcriptional efficiency can be regulated. A promoter may have weaker equilibrium (Kd) or unfavorable kinetic interactions with the polymerase, that is, low kon and high koff values. Thus, both kinetic and thermodynamic interactions can play a role in dictating the efficiency of transcription. Efficiency of transcription is also controlled by steps following initial DNA binding, such as open complex formation, binding of initiating nucleotides, phosphodiester bond formation, and processivity of RNA synthesis. The equilibrium interactions of Φ10 and Φ3.8 promoters with the polymerase were measured using fluorimetric titrations. The increase in fluorescence of 2-AP-modified promoters upon binding to the polymerase was used to determine the apparent Kd values. The derived Kd values indicate that T7 RNA polymerase does discriminate against Φ3.8 promoter at the DNA binding step. Φ3.8 promoter interaction with the polymerase was at least 2-fold weaker relative to the strong Φ10 promoter. Investigation of the stopped-flow kinetics of DNA binding showed that the weaker interactions of the Φ3.8 DNA were due to slower kon, the bimolecular rate constant of DNA binding, as well as faster koff, the dissociation rate constant. The Kd values calculated from the ratio of koff/kon for the various Φ3.8 promoters are also consistently weaker relative to the Φ10 promoters (see Table I). The kinetics of protein-DNA interactions (the kon and koff values) must play a significant role in promoter discrimination in vivo. The slow kon and faster koff translates into unfavorable kinetic interactions that could decrease promoter utilization. The 2-fold lower kon and the 2-fold higher koff together make Φ3.8 a weaker promoter relative to Φ10. Exactly which base change in Φ3.8 is responsible for the weaker binding cannot be determined from this study. Most likely candidates are bases at positions −11, −12, and −13 because base changes at these positions occur in T7 promoters at lower frequencies (6-18%) than changes at, say, position −2 (30%) (6Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 477-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The initial steps of DNA binding, including closed and open binary complex formation, have been studied to a large extent with E. coli RNA polymerase (13Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). Techniques such as DNA footprinting and nitrocellulose membrane binding have been used to measure the kinetics of DNA binding. Similarly, sensitivity of open single-stranded DNA to KMnO4 (24Hayatsu H. Ukita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 556-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Kainz M. Roberts J. Science. 1992; 255: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and nitrocellulose filter binding (26Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 258: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Wellington S.R. Spiegelman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7205-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been used to probe open complex formation steps. All of these methods are manual and cannot measure transient complexes formed with rapid kinetics. The stopped-flow method, especially with promoter DNAs containing the fluorescent base 2-AP, is ideal for measuring the kinetics of DNA binding as well as the kinetics of promoter opening in real time. The fluorescence of 2-AP is sensitive to changes in the state of the DNA. Thus, stopped-flow kinetic studies with promoter DNAs containing 2-AP bases placed in the initiation region allow measurement of local conformational changes, such as DNA melting, that occur during initiation. Additionally, these experiments provide both kinetic and equilibrium information necessary to elucidate the detailed mechanism of DNA binding during transcription. To dissect the various steps in the mechanism of promoter binding, the kinetics of DNA binding were measured by following both the changes in the fluorescence of protein and the 2-AP DNA. These experiments indicated that both protein and DNA fluorescence changes measured the same bimolecular process of DNA binding to the protein. No distinct kinetic phase due to promoter opening was observed with the fluorescent 2-AP DNAs. Stopped-flow study of both protein and DNA fluorescence changes provided the kon and koff rate constants that describe the overall rate of binary complex formation and dissociation. Comparison of the kinetic constants for different promoters shows that the strength of binary complex is determined by both the kon and the koff values (Table I). Partially dsDNA promoters bind to the polymerase with the highest affinity. The strong binding of partially dsDNAs is due to both a higher kon (5-10-fold) and a lower koff (2-200 fold) compared to the fully dsDNAs. Furthermore, it is also seen, that the ds Φ10 promoter binds to the polymerase strongly, and with a higher kon (about 2-fold) and a lower koff (about 2-fold) relative to the weaker ds Φ3.8 promoter. The lower koff values indicate that the binary complex is kinetically stable. Thus, the partially dsDNAs form the most kinetically stable binary complexes whereas the Φ3.8 dsDNAs the least. The lower than diffusion limited kon and the differences in kon values between various promoter DNAs suggest that DNA binding occurs by a two-step mechanism, E+D⇄K1EDa⇄k2k−2EDbReaction 3 The first step in the above mechanism represents the diffusion-controlled binding of the DNA to the polymerase to form EDa, with an equilibrium association constant K1. The interactions of the DNA with polymerase in this complex are weak, and the free polymerase, DNA, and the EDa species are in rapid equilibrium (that is, the rates of binding and dissociation are faster relative to k2 and k−2). Therefore, although there are two steps in the DNA binding mechanism, due to fast formation of EDa, the stopped-flow kinetics showed only one phase. The second step leading to the formation of EDb is a conformational change, wherein the interactions between the polymerase and the DNA are more stable. If we compare the above mechanism to that proposed for DNA binding to E. coli RNA polymerase (13Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar), the EDa complex would be analogous to one of the closed binary complexes, and the EDb species may be analogous to one of the open complexes. Since the stopped-flow kinetics of DNA binding measured by protein or DNA fluorescence changes were identical, the isomerization step may be global. In other words, both polymerase and DNA may change their conformation concomitantly during the isomerization step leading to formation of EDb. Studies with partially dsDNA promoters (both 2-AP and unmodified DNAs) provide clues as to the nature of this second step. Since the partially dsDNAs are already open, we did not expect the 2-AP fluorescence to change. However, the 2-AP fluorescence in the partially dsDNAs increased in an analogous manner as in the fully dsDNAs. These results can be explained in two ways. The 2-AP fluorescence increase may be due to a conformational change that occurs in both fully double-stranded and partially dsDNAs such as DNA twisting or DNA bending, distortions which could lead to promoter opening (29Travers A.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 181-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, DNA bending or twisting may represent the second step in mechanism (Reaction R3), and the resulting EDb complex in the fully dsDNA promoters may be an intermediate open binary complex. Alternatively, the increase in 2-AP fluorescence may simply be due to the change in the protein conformation which may result in changes in the local environment around the DNA. According to the proposed mechanism (Reaction R3), the bimolecular rate constant, kon listed in Table I is equal to K1k2 and the measured dissociation rate constant, koff is equal to k−2. The lower-than-diffusion-limited kon values for the fully dsDNA promoters can result both from a weaker EDa complex or a slower conformational change (k2). The Φ3.8 promoter, which has a lower kon, therefore forms a weaker EDa complex or undergoes a slower conformational change, or both, relative to the Φ10 promoter. Since the partially dsDNAs are already open, they do not have to go through a “closed” complex, and therefore the kon values of partially dsDNAs are higher and close to diffusion-limited. The above two-step mechanism of DNA binding predicts that the observed rate constants should saturate at k2+ k−2 at high DNA or polymerase concentrations. Since no saturation was observed in our measurements up to rate constant of 100 s−1, the second step in the above mechanism must be fast (>100 s−1) for both the Φ10 and Φ3.8 promoters. Relative to the rates of transcription initiation, 2In T7 RNA polymerase, transcription initiation occurs at rate constants ranging from 1 to 5 s−1 (Y. Jia and S. S. Patel, unpublished results). EDb, the intermediate open binary complex, is formed with fast kinetics that cannot limit transcription initiation. This does not mean that regulation cannot occur at the DNA binding step. Although promoter opening is not rate-limiting, the equilibrium constants of DNA binding and isomerization steps can modulate the efficiency of transcription initiation. For instance, the faster koff (or k−2) of Φ3.8 makes the isomerization of EDa to EDb to occur with an unfavorable equilibrium relative to the Φ10 promoter. Thus, efficiency of transcription initiation is modulated kinetically by the macroscopic rate constants kon and koff, and thermodynamically by the equilibrium constants (K1 and k2/k−2) of the two steps during DNA binding."

https://openalex.org/W2118195657,"Receptor serine-threonine kinases (RSTK) mediate inhibitory as well as stimulatory signals for growth and differentiation by binding to members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. Over 12 different RSTKs have been isolated so far, displaying wide expression in peripheral tissues and in the nervous system. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel type I RSTK termed activin receptor-like kinase-7 (ALK-7) that, unlike other members of this receptor family, is predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system. The ALK-7 gene encodes a 55-kDa cell-surface protein that exhibits up to 78% amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domain to previously isolated type I receptors for TGF-β and activin. In the extracellular domain, however, ALK-7 is more divergent, displaying comparable similarities with all members of the ALK subfamily. RNase protection and in situ hybridization studies demonstrated a highly specific mRNA distribution restricted to neurons in several regions of the adult rat central nervous system, including cerebellum, hippocampus, and nuclei of the brainstem. Receptor reconstitution and cross-linking experiments indicated that ALK-7 can form complexes with type II RSTKs for TGF-β and activin in a ligand-dependent manner, although direct binding of ALK-7 to ligand in these complexes could not be demonstrated. The specific expression pattern of ALK-7, restricted to the postnatal central nervous system, indicates that this receptor may play an important role in the maturation and maintenance of several neuronal subpopulations. Receptor serine-threonine kinases (RSTK) mediate inhibitory as well as stimulatory signals for growth and differentiation by binding to members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily. Over 12 different RSTKs have been isolated so far, displaying wide expression in peripheral tissues and in the nervous system. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel type I RSTK termed activin receptor-like kinase-7 (ALK-7) that, unlike other members of this receptor family, is predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system. The ALK-7 gene encodes a 55-kDa cell-surface protein that exhibits up to 78% amino acid sequence identity in the kinase domain to previously isolated type I receptors for TGF-β and activin. In the extracellular domain, however, ALK-7 is more divergent, displaying comparable similarities with all members of the ALK subfamily.

DHP agonist and antagonist modulation of Ba2+ inward currents was assessed after coexpression of chimeric and mutant calcium channel α1 subunits with α2δ and β1a subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Whereas DHP antagonists required Thr-1066, DHP agonist modulation crucially depended on the additional presence of Gln-1070 (numbering according to α1C-a), which also further increased the sensitivity to DHP antagonists. Asp-955, which is found at the corresponding position in the calcium channel α1S subunit from carp skeletal muscle, displayed functional similarity to Gln-1070 with respect to DHP interaction. We conclude that these residues (Thr-1066 plus Gln-1070 or Asp-955), which are located in close vicinity on the same side of the putative α-helix of transmembrane segment IIIS5, form a crucial DHP binding motif.

We show that a chimera of murine (m) EGF in which the carboxyl-terminal tail is substituted for that of TGF-α (mEGF/TGF-α44-50) results in complex features that belie this initial simplistic assumption. Comparison of EGF and mEGF/TGF-α44-50 in equilibrium binding assays showed that although the relative binding affinity of the chimera was reduced 80-200-fold, it was more potent than EGF in mitogenesis assays using NR6/HER cells. This superagonist activity could not be attributed to differences in ligand processing or to binding to other members of the c-erbB family. It appeared to be due, in part, to choice of an EGFR-overexpressing target cell where high receptor number compensated for the low affinity of the ligand; it also appeared to be related to the ability of the chimera to activate the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Thus, when EGFR autophosphorylation was measured, mEGF/TGF-α44-50 was more potent than EGF, despite its low affinity. When tested using chicken embryo fibroblasts, substitution of the TGF-α carboxyl-terminal tail into mEGF failed to enhance its binding affinity for chicken EGFRs; however, the chimera was intermediate in potency between TGF-α and mEGF in mitogenesis assays. Our results suggest a contextual requirement for EGFR recognition which is ligand-specific. Further, the unpredictable responses to chimeric ligands underline the complex nature of the processes of ligand recognition, receptor activation, and the ensuing cellular response.

Therefore, EGF treatment potentially results in the formation of several multimeric signaling complexes, including EGFR-Grb2-mSos1, EGFR-Shc-Grb2-mSos1, and Shc-Grb2-mSos1, linking the receptor to activation of the Ras GTPase. We have purified Grb2, mSos1, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex to high homogeneity, and used these isolated proteins to obtain binding affinities of mSos1 for Grb2 and of either Grb2 or Grb2-mSos1 for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides. mSos1 bound Grb2 with a KD of 0.4 μM; the stoichiometry of the Grb2-mSos1 complex was 1:1.

Furthermore, dissociation of EGFR and Shc from the Grb2-mSos1 complex upon phosphorylation of mSos1 within its C-terminal tail (23Rozakis-Adcock M. van der Geer P. Mbamalu G. Pawson T.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1327-1331PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that changes in the region of mSos1 that binds the Grb2 SH3 domain also affect interactions involving the Grb2 SH2 domain. Since the Grb2 SH2 domain does not interact directly with its SH3 domains (21Lemmon M.A. Ladbury J.E. Mandiyan V. Zhou M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31653-31658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cussac D. Frech M. Chardin P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4011-4021Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the proximity of mSos1 to Grb2 in the Grb2-mSos1 complex may allow mSos1 to bridge the SH2 and SH3 domains of Grb2 and play a role in modulating interactions of Grb2 SH2 with its phosphotyrosine-containing ligands. The substantial complexity of the Grb2-mSos1 heterodimer compared to Grb2 alone, the presence of constitutive Grb2-mSos1 complexes in cells, and the ability of phosphorylated mSos1 to affect interactions of the Grb2-mSos1 complex with phosphopeptide ligands have provided the impetus to compare the binding of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides to the Grb2-mSos1 complex or to Grb2 alone. We have successfully purified both mSos1 and the Grb2-mSos1 complex to high homogeneity from baculovirus-infected insect cells. The availability of both proteins has enabled us to use the SPR method to obtain kinetic parameters and binding affinities of Grb2 binding to full-length mSos1, and of the Grb2-mSos1 complex binding to EGFR and Shc phosphopeptides.

More significantly, we have shown that the Grb2-mSos1 complex binds phosphopeptides with higher affinity than Grb2, suggesting that mSos1 affects binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain to phosphopeptides.

A 4.7-kilobase fragment containing the full-length mSos1 coding sequence was generated from Bluescript-mSos1 by digestion with NotI and HindII. This fragment was then cloned into the NotI/SmaI sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen) resulting in the construct pVL1392-mSos1. A similar clone of pVL1392-Grb2 was obtained by ligating a SpeI-PstI fragment from a cDNA clone of murine Grb2 in the pCR™II vector (Invitrogen) with PstI-XbaI-digested pVL1392. mSos1- and Grb2-expressing baculoviruses were obtained by homologous recombination in Sf9 cells following Lipofectin cotransfection of BaculoGold™ DNA (Pharmingen) with pVL1392-mSos1 and pVL1392-Grb2, respectively. The viruses were plaque-purified and amplified at least twice using Sf9 insect cells grown in IPL41 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with yeastolate, lipid concentrate, Fungizone, gentamicin sulfate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. High titer stocks of both viruses were used to infect High Five™ (Stratagene) insect cells grown on 15-cm tissue culture dishes. Infected cells were harvested after 2-3 days of infection, pooled, and frozen at −70°C. Previously frozen mSos1 baculovirus-infected High Five™ cells (from 24 15-cm tissue culture dishes) were thawed and lysed in 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPPi, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and protease inhibitors (16 μg/mL benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), pH 7.0, with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, pH 7.0, were added to the lysate, which was then clarified by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant, which contained most of the mSos1 protein, was loaded onto a Q Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., 50 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, pH 7.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 50 to 300 mM NaCl in buffer A, in a 400-ml gradient volume. Fractions containing mSos1 were concentrated and exchanged into buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT, pH 6.6) containing 50 mM NaCl, then loaded onto a SP Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia, 100 ml). The column was washed with 120 ml of buffer B containing 50 mM NaCl followed by 120 ml of buffer B containing 100 mM NaCl before mSos1 was eluted in a gradient of 100-300 mM in buffer B, in a 600-ml gradient volume. Fractions containing mSos1 were concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 200 (Pharmacia) gel filtration column, where the protein was eluted in HBS buffer (50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT, pH 7.5). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining shows mSos1 to be ∼95% pure (Fig. 1). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nM, using a calculated extinction coefficient of 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Grb2 baculovirus-infected High Five™ cells from eight 15-cm tissue culture dishes were pooled and frozen at −70°C. Frozen insect cells were lysed in 20 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, protease inhibitors (same as above for mSos1 purification), pH 7.0) with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 50-ml Q Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl. After the column was washed with 75 ml of buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl, bound proteins were eluted in a gradient of 50 to 150 mM NaCl in buffer A, in 400 ml of gradient volume. Fractions containing Grb2 were pooled, concentrated, and subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column, in HBS buffer. The Grb2 sample was determined to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and the protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nM, using a calculated extinction coefficient of 3.76 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Grb2-mSos1 complexes were formed in vivo by coinfecting High Five™ cells with both mSos1 and Grb2 baculoviruses. Coinfection results in individual insect cells that are infected with both baculovirus and also cells that are infected with either mSos1 or Grb2 baculovirus. Upon lysis of the insect cells, previously uncomplexed mSos1 and Grb2 may interact to form the Grb2-mSos1 complex. Grb2-mSos1 complexes were obtained from coinfected cells to achieve optimal protein stability by in vivo complexation of the two proteins prior to the purification process. Doubly infected cells from 24 15-cm tissue culture dishes were harvested, pooled, and frozen at −70°C. Purification of the Grb2-mSos1 complex was the same as that for mSos1 (see above). During purification of the Grb2-mSos1 complex from coinfected insect cells, we have observed the existence of Grb2 (∼50% of all overexpressed Grb2) and mSos1 (<15% of all overexpressed mSos1) that were not complexed to each other. The first column (Q Sepharose) separated the majority of free Grb2 from the Grb2-mSos1 complex, and the second column (SP Sepharose) separated free mSos1 from the complex. The purified Grb2-mSos1 complex is ∼95% pure and is stable with negligible dissociation of its components (Fig. 1). The protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 1.46 × 105 M−1 cm−1 calculated after determination of the Grb2-mSos1 stoichiometry (see below). Molecular mass estimates of mSos1, Grb2, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex were obtained by analytical gel filtration on Superose 12 (Pharmacia) and Superdex 200 columns, in buffer conditions of varying pH, ionic strength, and magnesium concentration. Both columns were calibrated with protein molecular mass standards from Pharmacia. Dynamic light-scattering measurements were made using a DynaPro™-801 instrument (Protein Solutions Inc.). Shape-independent molecular mass determination methods including sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and laser light scattering were also performed on mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1. All hydrodynamic measurements were made at 20°C, in HBS buffer using protein solutions at 1.0-1.75 mg/ml. Analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out in a model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with interference optics, and data analysis was effected as described previously (26Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Initial sample concentrations were determined from a fringe count assuming an average refractive increment of 4.1 fringes mg−1ml−1 according to Babul and Stellwagon (27Babul J. Stellwagon E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The light-scattering measurements were determined in a Dawn F multiangle laser light-scattering photometer (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) using a manual injector. The common intercept on a Zimm plot of the extrapolations to zero angle and zero concentration yielded the reciprocal molecular mass; a value of 0.815 was assumed for dn/dc (the specific refractive index increment of the protein) for the samples. The purified Grb2-mSos1 complex was dissociated by addition of urea to 8 M. The two protein components were separated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column in buffer A containing 50 mM NaCl and 8 M urea. The ratio of the areas under both peaks and the extinction coefficients of the respective proteins were used to determine the molar ratio of Grb2 and mSos1 in the Grb2-mSos1 complex. This information and the molecular mass of the complex determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and laser light scattering were then used to determine the stoichiometry of the Grb2-mSos1 complex. The Shc-derived phosphopeptide (Shc pYVNV, amino acid sequence DPSpYVNVQNLDK) was a gift from Bob Hodges, University of Alberta (PENCE). The EGFR-derived phosphopeptide (EGFR1068, amino acid sequence VPEpYINQSVPK) was a gift from Steve Shoelson, Joslin Diabetes Center, MA. The insulin receptor-derived phosphopeptide (IR-PEP, amino acid sequence GPApYLNAKKFV) was synthesized using Fmoc ((9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase chemistry with direct incorporation of phosphotyrosine as the N-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl-O-phosphono-L-tyrosine derivative. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin and deprotection were achieved through a 90-min incubation at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid containing a scavenger mixture of thioanisol, 1,2-ethanedithiol, and water (1.0:0.1:2.0% by volume). The product was precipitated with cold t-butyl ethyl ether, collected by centrifugation and purified using reverse phase HPLC. The authenticity of the phosphopeptide was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. SPR experiments to monitor real time binding of proteins to their ligands were done on a BIAcore instrument (Pharmacia). Phosphopeptides were immobilized onto CM Biosensor chip surfaces by standard procedures (28O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). 10-30 μg of phosphopeptides in 50 mM HEPES, 1 M NaCl, pH 7.5, were presented to the activated chip surfaces for 7 min (up to 200 resonance units of phosphopeptides were immobilized) followed by inactivation of the surfaces with ethanolamine. Noncovalently bound peptides were removed with a 3-min pulse of 2 M guanidine hydrochloride. Analyses of the Grb2-mSos1 interactions were done by first immobilizing mSos1 onto the Biosensor chip surface. Immobilization procedures were identical to those for phosphopeptides except that mSos1 was presented to the activated chip in a buffer containing 50 mM sodium formate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.0, and noncovalently bound proteins were removed with 3-min pulses of 0.1 M NaOH. Negative control surfaces were generated by performing the immobilization under identical conditions as above in the absence of both peptide and protein. Dissociation constants, KD, were obtained from Scatchard analysis using responses at equilibrium for varying concentrations of protein. All measurements were done at 25°C, and refractive index errors due to bulk solvent effects were corrected by subtracting away responses on the negative control surfaces for each of the protein concentrations used. kon values were determined from measured apparent koff and KD. koff values were determined by injecting excess amounts of competing phosphopeptides Shc pYVNV precisely as the dissociation phase of protein from the chip surface occurs to prevent rebinding. koff values were calculated from ln(Rt1Rtn) = koff(tn− t1), where Rtn and Rt1 are responses at time n and starting time, respectively. We have purified Grb2, mSos1, and the Grb2-mSos1 complex. The availability of these proteins and their phosphopeptide ligands have allowed us to reconstitute some of the events in the Ras signaling pathway in vitro. Highly purified proteins have enabled us to measure equilibrium and kinetic parameters for binding of Grb2 to mSos1, and binding of the Grb2-mSos1 complex to phosphopeptide ligands mimicking known physiological upstream ligands (Shc and EGFR). In the process of purifying mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1, gel filtration was also used analytically to determine the sizes of these proteins. Both species had elution volumes corresponding to 403 ± 50 kDa. This mass was invariant in buffers with pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8.0, NaCl concentration between 50 and 300 mM, and Mg2+ concentration between 0 and 10 mM. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering with DynaPro™-801 indicated that mSos1 behaves like a protein of molecular mass 263 ± 16 kDa. These studies suggested that both mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1 exist in solution as oligomers. However, both methods of molecular mass determination depend on prior calibration with globular proteins of known molecular masses, and the results obtained can be severely distorted for nonglobular proteins. Therefore, we pursued more rigorous methods of molecular mass determination that are shape-independent, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and laser light scattering. Results from sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation for both mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1 are shown in Fig. 1. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation indicated maximum molecular masses at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge cell of 160-170 kDa for mSos1 and 170-190 kDa for Grb2-mSos1. Ultracentrifugation data obtained from both samples indicated slight heterogeneity due to proteolytic degradation, most likely due to the 48-h incubation at 20°C necessary for the experiment. Laser light-scattering experiments indicated molecular masses of 135 and 150 kDa for mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1, respectively. Therefore, both shape-independent molecular mass determination methods suggest that mSos1 and Grb2-mSos1 are monomers in solution. Separation of unfolded Grb2-mSos1 complex by gel filtration in 8 M urea gave a molar ratio of 1:1 for its protein components. This ratio, together with the molecular mass of 170-190 kDa by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, suggests that the complex contains one molecule each of Grb2 and mSos1. The stoichiometry of Grb2-mSos1 allowed calculation of the extinction coefficient of the complex to determine the concentration of the proteins used in binding studies. The purified mSos1 and Grb2 proteins were used in SPR experiments to obtain dissociation constants for Grb2 binding to mSos1 that had been immobilized on a Biosensor chip. Raw data from these experiments, and results from the corresponding Scatchard analysis of equilibrium responses of Grb2 binding to mSos1, are shown in Fig. 2. Grb2 bound to mSos1 with a KD of 451 ± 107 nM, a value lower than KD values in the micromolar ra"

INTRODUCTIONAntimicrobial peptides originating from multicellular organisms have been discovered, mainly in arthropods including insects, vertebrates, and plants (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some antimicrobial peptides isolated from evolutionally distant origins are structurally similar. For example, defensins were originally found in mammalian neutrophil cells (2Zeya H.I. Spitznagel J.K. Science. 1963; 142: 1085-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Insect/arthropod defensins, isolated from the body fluid of insects and other arthropods, show a certain degree of sequence similarity with mammalian defensins (3Lambert J. Keppi E. Dimarcq J-L. Wicker C. Reichhart J-M. Dunbar B. Lepage P. Dorsselaer A.V. Hoffmann J. Fothergill J. Hoffmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Both mammalian and insect defensins contain six cysteine residues contributing intramolecular disulfide bridges. Cecropins, linear and mostly helical antibacterial peptides without cysteine residues, were first detected in insects (4Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and later isolated from porcine small intestine (5Lee J-Y. Boman A. Sun C. Andersson M. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9159-9162Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Plant defensins are antifungal peptides with eight cysteine residues (6Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Osborn R.W. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and a homologue, drosomycin, was recently demonstrated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (7Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition, most immune proteins of insects, including antimicrobial peptides, are induced by bacterial challenge or wounding. The gene expression of these immune proteins is suggested to be regulated by transcription factors that resemble those controlling the genes for immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins in vertebrates, e.g. NFκB. These results suggest that such regulatory systems are of evolutionally ancient origin, i.e. prior to the divergence of deuterostomes (e.g. vertebrates) from protostomes (e.g. insects) (8Ip Y.T. Reach M. Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Cai H. Gonzalez-Crespo S. Tatei K. Levine M. Cell. 1993; 19: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (382) Google Scholar).It is, therefore, possible to argue that some innate immune systems related to antimicrobial peptides may be evolutionally related. However, little has been experimentally studied on the early events in the evolution of the antimicrobial peptide-related defense systems. From this aspect, it is clearly important to explore how antimicrobial peptides and their gene regulation in lower invertebrates diverged during an ancient process of evolution. Although few fossil records are available, nematodes are thought to be of very ancient origin, at least comparable with the divergence time of the lines leading to vertebrates and to arthropods from an ancient group (9Vanfleteren J.R. Evers E.A.I.M. Van De Werken G. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The similarity of the antimicrobial peptide-related defense systems among evolutionally distant organisms, furthermore, encourages the application of model animals for studying the innate immunity. It has already been proposed that D. melanogaster may provide an excellent model for a molecular and genetic approach to innate immune reactions, including organisms other than insects (10Hultmark D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Similarly, the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, can also be another candidate for a model.Parasitic nematodes in animal intestines can survive not only a hostile hydrolytic environment and host immune attacks but also a microbe-rich environment. Hence, the immune defenses against coliform microbes are essential for the parasites. We have already reported antibacterial, bacteriolytic, and agglutinating activities in the body fluid of the intestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 1J. Moore, R. Parton, and M. W. Kennedy, personal communication. The antibacterial factor ASABF (A. suum antibacterial factor) is a heat-stable and trypsin-sensitive molecule, i.e. peptide/protein. In the present study, the purification, determination of primary structure, and cDNA cloning of ASABF were carried out. The results revealed that ASABF is a novel antibacterial peptide containing four intramolecular disulfide bridges and has several features similar to those of insect/arthropod defensins. ASABF homologues in C. elegans were, moreover, demonstrated by a computer-assisted search of data bases.MATERIALS AND METHODSNematodes and Collection of Body FluidAdult female A. suum were obtained from Tokyo Shibaura Zohki, Tokyo, Japan. The nematodes were kept at 4°C after isolation from pig small intestines, and body fluid was collected within 5 h as described previously (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The collected body fluid was stored at −120°C.MicroorganismsBacterial strains, Micrococcus luteus (IFO12708), Bacillus subtilis (IFO3134), and Proteus vulgaris (IFO3851T), and fungal strains, Alternaria brassicicola (IFO31227) and Septoria tritci (IFO7347), were purchased from the Institute for Fermentation (IFO), Osaka, Japan. Escherichia coli (JM109) was purchased from Takara. Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538P) was a gift from Dr. Masanori Yamamoto. Trichoderma viride (MAFF236543) was obtained from the National Institute of Agrobiological Resources, Tsukuba, Japan.Antimicrobial AssayInhibition zone assay was performed for the anti-S. aureus assay, as described previously (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, LB-agar plates (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with small wells containing 105 colony-forming units/ml (final) logarithmic phase bacteria were prepared. Samples were poured into each well and incubated at 37°C for 18 h. Antibacterial activity was detected as clear zones around the wells after the incubation. The inhibition zone assay was also used for the antifungal assay. Fungi were inoculated on potato-dextrose agar plates (Difco). Wells cut at the edge of the developing fungal lawn received samples. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 72 h, and the formation of clear zones was observed.In order to determine the IC50, 2The abbreviations used are: IC5050% growth inhibitory concentrationHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPCRpolymerase chain reactionSLspliced leaderntnucleotidekbpkilobase pair. the microdilution method described by Alvarez-Bravo et al. (13Alvarez-Bravo J. Kurata S. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used with modification. Each bacterial strain in the logarithmic phase was suspended in 200 μl of optimum medium, containing a series of purified ASABF at a 2-fold increase in concentration. The optical density of the bacterial suspension was adjusted to 0.02 at 650 nm. The following media were used: LB medium for E. coli and S. aureus and IFO802 medium (10 g of polypeptone, 2 g of yeast extract, 1 g of MgSO4/7H2O, 1 liter of distilled water, pH 7.0) for B. subtilis, M. luteus, and P. vulgaris. The bacterial suspension was incubated at 37°C for E. coli and S. aureus and at 30°C for B. subtilis, M. luteus, and P. vulgaris. Twenty-four h after the incubation, the optical density of the bacterial suspension was measured at 650 nm.Purification of ASABFStep 1. Gel Permeation HPLCDefrosted body fluid was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris. The supernatant was applied to a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) connected to a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. A modified saline solution (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution pattern was monitored at 280 nm. A part of each fraction was directly subjected to inhibition zone assay, and the antibacterial activity against S. aureus was assessed. To estimate the molecular mass of ASABF, a series of standards was used: bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), aprotinin (6.5 kDa), and cyanocobalamin (1.36 kDa). We repeated this step to purify a greater amount of ASABF.Step 2. Reversed-phase HPLCThe fractions exhibiting antibacterial activity, which were derived from 3-6 ml of parent body fluid, were applied to a Purecil C18 column (Millipore Corp.) connected to a Waters HPLC system. Two linear gradient elutions were employed after an elution with ultrapure water for 25 min: 0-40% acetonitrile over 40 min and 40-100% acetonitrile over 10 min. Both the ultrapure water and acetonitrile used as mobile phases contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was constant at 1 ml/min at ambient temperature. The elution pattern was monitored at 225 nm. The fractions were vacuum-dried and then dissolved in ultrapure water again to test the antibacterial activity against S. aureus by inhibition zone assay. The purity of ASABF was tested by tricine/SDS-PAGE with 16% acrylamide gels (14Schagger H.J. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). A series of standards were used to estimate the molecular mass of ASABF: myoglobin (16.9 kDa), myoglobin I-II (14.4 kDa), myoglobin I (8.2 kDa), myoglobin II (6.2 kDa), and myoglobin III (2.5 kDa). The proteins in the gels were visualized by a silver staining kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.).S-PyridylethylationTwenty to forty μg of purified ASABF was dissolved into 200 μl of 0.25 M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 M EDTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. The sample was flushed with nitrogen and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Two μl of 4-vinylpyridine was added, and the sample was flushed with nitrogen again and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. S-Pyridylethylated ASABF was separated from the reagents by reversed-phase HPLC using a Sephacil C18 SC2.1/10 microbore column connected to a Pharmacia SMART system. Two linear gradient elutions were employed after an elution with ultrapure water for 3 min: 0-40% acetonitrile over 40 min and 40-100% acetonitrile over 5 min. Both the ultrapure water and acetonitrile used as mobile phases contained 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was constant at 0.1 ml/min at ambient temperature. The elution pattern was monitored at 225 and 280 nm. S-Pyridylethylated ASABF was eluted at 27% acetonitrile.Protease DigestionLysyl Endopeptidase DigestionTwenty to forty μg of purified ASABF or S-pyridylethylated ASABF was dissolved in 100 μl of 200 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 8 M urea. The dissolved samples were diluted twice with ultrapure water, and 1 μg of lysylendopeptidase was added. The digestion was carried out at 37°C for 3 h.V8 Protease DigestionTwenty to forty μg of S-pyridylethylated ASABF was dissolved in 200 μl of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 μg of S. aureus V8 protease and digested at 37°C for 18 h.The fragments derived by protease digestion were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described for S-pyridylethylation.Determination of Amino Acid SequencePurified ASABF, S-pyridylethylated ASABF, and the fragments derived by protease digestion were lyophilized and subjected to automated sequence analysis using an Applied Biosystems Procise™ or a Beckman LF3000.Mass SpectrometryThe exact molecular mass of intact ASABF was determined by an ion spray ionization mass spectrometer (API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, Perkin-Elmer). The quadrupole was scanned over 500-2000 Da using a step size of 0.1 Da and a 1.0-ms dwell time/step. A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used (Voyager™-RP, PerSeptive Biosystems) to determine the mass of the S-pyridylethylated fragment of ASABF, Arg68-Gly89.cDNA CloningA cDNA for ASABF was cloned using three-step PCR amplification.Step 1. Reverse Transcriptase-PCRThe poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the body walls of adult female A. suum, as described by Kuramochi et al. (15Kuramochi T. Hirawake H. Kojima S. Takamiya S. Furushima R. Aoki T.

Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized from 0.3 μg of the poly(A)+ RNA and oligo(dT)20-M4 adaptor primer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC(T)20-3′, using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The cDNA coding Thr34-Arg43 was amplified by PCR using a set of degenerate primers: the sense primer (29-mer) whose sequence is deduced from Cys27-Gly33 with a designed 5′-flanking sequence, 5′-GCGCGCGCGTG(T/C)AA(A/G)TT(T/C)CA(A/G)AA(T/C)TG(T/C)GG-3′; and the antisense primer (27-mer) whose sequence is deduced from Pro44-Asp49 with designed 5′-flanking sequence, 5′-AGCAGCAGC(A/G)TC(A/G)CA(A/T/G/C)AC(A/G)CA(A/T/G/C)GT(A/T/G/C)GG-3′. All reagents used in this step were obtained from an RNA LA PCR kit (AMV) (Takara). Denaturation was carried out at 95°C for 6 min (first cycle) or 1 min (second and following cycles), annealing at 35°C (initial 10 cycles) or 45°C (following 30 cycles) for 1 min, and polymerization at 72°C for 1 min. The total number of cycles was 40. Only the product of expected size was found. This product was subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced by a dye terminator system (PRISM™, Applied Biosystems) with an automated DNA sequencer (373A, Applied Biosystems).Step 2. Amplification of 5′-End Using SL1 PrimerMost of the mRNAs in Ascaris lumbricoides are trans-spliced and acquire a common 22-nt SL1 sequence at the 5′-end (16Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Darzynkiewicz E. Laneve R. Nilsen T.W. RNA. 1995; 1: 714-723PubMed Google Scholar). It is thus highly possible that cDNAs for ASABF contain the SL1 sequence. PCR was performed using a set of primers: the sense primer (22-mer) whose sequence is identical to the SL1 sequence, 5′-GGTTAAATTACCCAAGTTTGAG-3′; the antisense primer (23-mer) whose sequence is identical to that for Thr34-Arg43 revealed in “Step 1,” 5′-CGACCTCCACGTTTCTCACAGTG-3′. All reagents used in this step were obtained from an LA PCR kit Ver.2 (Takara). Denaturation was carried out at 95°C for 6 min (first cycle) or 1 min (second and following cycles), annealing at 55°C for 1 min, and polymerization at 72°C for 1 min. Taq DNA polymerase was added during the first denaturation, i.e. a hot start mode. The cycle was repeated 30 times. The major product was shown to be of 0.2 kbp and was subcloned. The nucleotide sequence of the product was sequenced as described above. The nucleotide sequence deduced the putative signal sequence and the N-terminal region of the mature ASABF.Step 3: 3′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA EndsTo determine the sequence of a full-length cDNA for ASABF, 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out using a set of primers: the sense primer (35-mer) whose sequence is identical to the 5′ untranslated region revealed in “Step 2,” 5′-GATATTCAGCAAAAAAGACAAAACTACTGTCGACC-3′; and M13M4 primer (17-mer) as an antisense primer, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′. PCR conditions were identical to those described under “Step 2.” Major products were found to be of 0.6 and 0.25 kbp. Their sequences revealed that the product of 0.6 kbp was the full-length cDNA for ASABF, except for the SL1 sequence.Computer-assisted Sequence AnalysisStandard sequence analyses were performed using Genetyx-Mac Ver. 7.3 (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). The MPsrch™ (Smith-Waterman algorithm, University of Edinburgh, U. K.) was used for searching the nucleic acid data bases at DDBJ, GenBank, and EBI Data Bank and the protein data bases at Swiss-Prot, Protein Information Resource, GenPept, and Protein Data Bank via the on-line E-mail server of the DNA Information and Stock Center, Tsukuba, Japan. Furthermore, the cDNA catalogue of C. elegans, including unpublished data, was searched using the BLAST algorithm (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69141) Google Scholar) through the kindness of Prof. Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). The statistical significance of sequence similarity was estimated by a jumbling test (18Schwartz, R. M., Dayhoff, M. O., (1978) Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, Vol. 5, Suppl. 3, pp. 353–358, National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C..Google Scholar) using the program employed by Nagata et al. (19Nagata A. Suzuki Y. Igarashi M. Eguchi N. Toh H. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4020-4024Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The criteria described by Doolittle (20Doolittle R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were used to evaluate the score of the jumbling test.DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the purification, primary structure, and cDNA cloning of the novel antibacterial peptide ASABF discovered in the body fluid of the nematode A. suum. ASABF has been confirmed as a peptide, and it is thus strongly suggested that antibacterial peptides contribute to the immune defense of the ancient animal nematodes. Mature ASABF is a basic 71-residue peptide containing eight cysteines engaged in intramolecular disulfide bridges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the structure of an antibacterial protein in a nematode.In some trials, a protein exhibiting weak antibacterial activity was eluted at higher acetonitrile concentration than that of ASABF, by reversed-phase HPLC in step 2 of the purification. The IC50 of this minor antibacterial protein against S. aureus was estimated to be 200 μg/ml, which is much higher than that of ASABF. The N-terminal 19-amino acid sequence of this peptide was completely identical to that of ABA-1 (21Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ABA-1 is known to be the most abundant protein in the body fluid of A. suum and binds fatty acids at high affinities. We separated ABA-1 by gel permeation HPLC using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. This partially purified ABA-1 was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC. Neither the partially purified ABA-1 nor any fractions separated by reversed-phase HPLC exhibited antibacterial activity against S. aureus and M. luteus. We speculate that the minor antibacterial activity might be attributed to a protein similar to ABA-1 or a degraded ABA-1. However, further analyses could not be carried out because this minor antibacterial activity was not always observed. There is no evidence to indicate other antibacterial factors in the body fluid. Furthermore, the antibacterial spectrum of ASABF is in good agreement with that of the body fluid (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 3Y. Kato, unpublished data. It is, therefore, suggested that ASABF is the major antibacterial molecule in the body fluid of A. suum.The cDNA cloning studies reveal that mature ASABF is processed from a 93-residue precursor. A 4-residue peptide, Arg90-Ser93, is thought to be removed in addition to the elimination of a putative signal peptide by the processing. The exact mechanism of the processing remains to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that the 4-residue peptide includes a dibasic cleavage site Arg90-Arg91 (22Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 23Bulet P. Dimarcq J-L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Dorsselaer A.V. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14893-14897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Several types of antimicrobial peptides containing cysteine residues have been reported. Insect/arthropod defensins are antibacterial peptides containing six cysteine residues engaged in intramolecular disulfide bridges (24Chernysh S. Cociancich S. Briand J-P. Hetru C. Bulet P. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 81-89Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We found similarity between ASABF and insect/arthropod defensins in several features. Both of them are cationic peptides and more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. Insect/arthropod defensins have a consensus sequence, Cys1-[…]-Cys2-Xaa-Xaa-Xaa-Cys3-[…]-Gly-Xaa-Cys4-[…]-Cys5-Xaa-Cys6 (25Cociancich S. Goyffon M. Bontems F. Bulet P. Bouet F. Menez A. Hoffmann J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This consensus sequence is highly conservative among insect/arthropod defensins, except for the Gly between Cys3 and Cys4 of sapecin B (26Yamada K. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We can find the consensus sequence in the sequence of mature ASABF ignoring Cys50 and Cys69. The intramolecular disulfide bridges are essential for the antibacterial activity of the insect defensin, sapecin (27Kazuhara T. Nakajima Y. Matsuyama K. Natori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The antibacterial activity of ASABF was also lost by S-pyridylethylation. In contrast to these similar features, some other data do not support the belief that ASABF is a member of the insect/arthropod defensin family. A computer-assisted multiple alignment suggests that tenecin (28Moon H.J. Lee S.Y. Kurata S. Natori S. Lee B.L. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) is the insect/arthropod defensin most similar to ASABF (Fig. 3). The homology between tenecin and ASABF is 25% identity and 52% similarity in the optimum region corresponding to Ser24-Cys66 of ASABF. The statistical significance of the sequence similarity was evaluated by a jumbling test. The normalized alignment score was estimated to be 3.82 of the standard deviation, and its evaluation is “marginal” (20Doolittle R.F. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All of the normalized alignment scores between ASABF and other insect/arthropod defensins are >3.0 of the standard deviation, i.e. “improbably significant,” except for sapecin B (3.01 of the standard deviation). 4The jumbling test was carried out for the insect/arthropod defensins listed in 24Chernysh S. Cociancich S. Briand J-P. Hetru C. Bulet P. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 81-89Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar. In conclusion, the significant sequence similarity is not verified, whereas some similar features are observed between ASABF and insect/arthropod defensins. Moreover, ASABF contains eight cysteine residues, whereas the number of cysteine residues is six, without exception, in insect/arthropod defensins (24Chernysh S. Cociancich S. Briand J-P. Hetru C. Bulet P. J. Insect Physiol. 1996; 42: 81-89Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We thus propose to classify ASABF into a novel group of antibacterial proteins in the present situation. However, we are not rejecting the proposal that ASABF and insect/arthropod defensins are possibly related by common ancestry. Are they evolutionally related? This question is curious from the aspect of a search for the origin of cysteine-rich antibacterial peptides. Insect/arthropod defensins show a certain degree of sequence similarity with mammalian defensins as mentioned in the Introduction. It is unclear whether these antibacterial peptides diverged from a common ancestor molecule. The discovery of ASABF, however, suggests that the cysteine-rich antibacterial peptides could be very ancient in origin. Further studies on antibacterial proteins in lower invertebrates should elucidate the evolutional relationship among ASABF, insect/arthropod defensins, and mammalian defensins. In addition, antifungal peptides containing eight cysteine residues have been also reported, i.e. plant defensins and drosomycin (see Introduction). ASABF exhibits no potent antifungal activity and no significant sequence similarity to these antifungal peptides. However, allowing for several gaps, the array consisting of eight cysteine residues seems to be arranged in a similar pattern between ASABF and these antifungal peptides. Interestingly, it has been suggested that structural and functional properties of plant defensins resemble those of insect and mammalian defensins (6Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Osborn R.W. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Revealing the relationship between ASABF and these antifungal peptides might be another key to studying the evolutional relationship among cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides.One of our goals is to introduce the nematode C. elegans as a model animal for investigation on innate immunity, as mentioned in the Introduction. From this aspect, it is very curious regarding whether ASABF homologues exist in C. elegans. A cDNA catalogue by Prof. Yuji Kohara was searched. BLAST data base searches revealed significant sequence identity with a deduced protein from the cDNA sequence, yk150c7 (Fig. 4). In the optimum region corresponding to Leu33-Gly72 of ASABF, yk150c7 exhibits 42% identity and 57% similarity with a normalized alignment score of 5.61 of the standard deviation, i.e. “probably significant.” Furthermore, nucleic acid data bases and protein data bases were searched. The protein deduced from the putative gene, T22H6.5, was found to be a protein most similar to both ASABF and yk150c7 by the MPsrch™ data base search (Fig. 4). In the optimum region corresponding to Leu40-Cys69 of ASABF, T22H6.5 exhibits 39.4% identity and 54.5% similarity with a normalized alignment score of 4.61 of the standard deviation. T22H6.5 is also similar to yk150c7 with 48.6% identity and 67.6% similarity in the optimum region corresponding to Phe38-Cys74 of T22H6.5. T22H6.5 contains nine cysteine residues, and one of the cysteines is found in the highly hydrophobic putative signal sequence at the N-terminal region. The array consisting of eight other cysteine residues is similar to that of ASABF. It is noteworthy that the highly similar region among ASABF, yk150c7, and T22H6.5 is almost identical to the region overlapping insect/arthropod defensins (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The function of the deduced proteins from yk150c7 and T22H6.5 has been unknown and is not predicted. Further experimental analyses are necessary to confirm the function of these ASABF homologues in C. elegans.Fig. 4Alignment of ASABF and the homologues in C. elegans. The conserved arrays consisting of eight cysteine residues are marked with asterisks. Identical residues are dark-stippled, and similar residues are light-stippled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To date, a number of antimicrobial proteins were isolated from multicellular animals. Most of them are, however, derived from higher animals, e.g. vertebrates and arthropods. The higher animals seem to develop characteristic defense systems, e.g. B- and T-cell-based adaptive immunity in vertebrates and prophenoloxidase cascades in arthropods, overlaying primitive immunity as described previously (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Studying the immune defense of lower invertebrates, such as nematodes, could be a way to isolate the primitive systems from these additional systems. The present work was carried out as the initial step of this project. INTRODUCTIONAntimicrobial peptides originating from multicellular organisms have been discovered, mainly in arthropods including insects, vertebrates, and plants (1Boman H.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some antimicrobial peptides isolated from evolutionally distant origins are structurally similar. For example, defensins were originally found in mammalian neutrophil cells (2Zeya H.I. Spitznagel J.K. Science. 1963; 142: 1085-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Insect/arthropod defensins, isolated from the body fluid of insects and other arthropods, show a certain degree of sequence similarity with mammalian defensins (3Lambert J. Keppi E. Dimarcq J-L. Wicker C. Reichhart J-M. Dunbar B. Lepage P. Dorsselaer A.V. Hoffmann J. Fothergill J. Hoffmann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Both mammalian and insect defensins contain six cysteine residues contributing intramolecular disulfide bridges. Cecropins, linear and mostly helical antibacterial peptides without cysteine residues, were first detected in insects (4Steiner H. Hultmark D. Engstrom A. Bennich H. Boman H.G. Nature. 1981; 292: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) and later isolated from porcine small intestine (5Lee J-Y. Boman A. Sun C. Andersson M. Jornvall H. Mutt V. Boman H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9159-9162Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Plant defensins are antifungal peptides with eight cysteine residues (6Broekaert W.F. Terras F.R.G. Cammue B.P.A. Osborn R.W. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 1353-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and a homologue, drosomycin, was recently demonstrated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (7Fehlbaum P. Bulet P. Michaut L. Lagueux M. Broekaert W.F. Hetru C. Hoffmann J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33159-33163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In addition, most immune proteins of insects, including antimicrobial peptides, are induced by bacterial challenge or wounding. The gene expression of these immune proteins is suggested to be regulated by transcription factors that resemble those controlling the genes for immunoglobulins and acute phase response proteins in vertebrates, e.g. NFκB. These results suggest that such regulatory systems are of evolutionally ancient origin, i.e. prior to the divergence of deuterostomes (e.g. vertebrates) from protostomes (e.g. insects) (8Ip Y.T. Reach M. Engstrom Y. Kadalayil L. Cai H. Gonzalez-Crespo S. Tatei K. Levine M. Cell. 1993; 19: 753-763Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (382) Google Scholar).It is, therefore, possible to argue that some innate immune systems related to antimicrobial peptides may be evolutionally related. However, little has been experimentally studied on the early events in the evolution of the antimicrobial peptide-related defense systems. From this aspect, it is clearly important to explore how antimicrobial peptides and their gene regulation in lower invertebrates diverged during an ancient process of evolution. Although few fossil records are available, nematodes are thought to be of very ancient origin, at least comparable with the divergence time of the lines leading to vertebrates and to arthropods from an ancient group (9Vanfleteren J.R. Evers E.A.I.M. Van De Werken G. Van Beeumen J.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The similarity of the antimicrobial peptide-related defense systems among evolutionally distant organisms, furthermore, encourages the application of model animals for studying the innate immunity. It has already been proposed that D. melanogaster may provide an excellent model for a molecular and genetic approach to innate immune reactions, including organisms other than insects (10Hultmark D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 178-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Similarly, the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, can also be another candidate for a model.Parasitic nematodes in animal intestines can survive not only a hostile hydrolytic environment and host immune attacks but also a microbe-rich environment. Hence, the immune defenses against coliform microbes are essential for the parasites. We have already reported antibacterial, bacteriolytic, and agglutinating activities in the body fluid of the intestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum (11Kato Y. Zool. Sci. 1995; 12: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 1J. Moore, R. Parton, and M. W. Kennedy, personal communication. The antibacterial factor ASABF (A. suum antibacterial factor) is a heat-stable and trypsin-sensitive molecule, i.e. peptide/protein. In the present study, the purification, determination of primary structure, and cDNA cloning of ASABF were carried out. The results revealed that ASABF is a novel antibacterial peptide containing four intramolecular disulfide bridges and has several features similar to those of insect/arthropod defensins. ASABF homologues in C. elegans were, moreover, demonstrated by a computer-assisted search of data bases."

INTRODUCTIONA wide range of immune and inflammatory responses are influenced by the cytokine IL-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1interleukin-1IL-1rainterleukin-1 receptor antagonistIL-1Rinterleukin-1 receptorJl-azetidine-2-carboxylic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1IL-8interleukin-8IL-6interleukin-6. (1Dinarello C.A. FASEB J... 1994; 8: 1314-1325Google Scholar). The two agonists IL-1α and IL-1β can cause both local and systemic inflammatory responses. Prolonged expression of even low levels of IL-1 can have detrimental consequences in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (2Arend W.P. Dayer J.-M. Arthritis & Rheum. 1995; 33: 151-160Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and inflammatory bowel disease (3Casini-Raggi V. Kam L. Chong Y.J.T. Fiocchi C. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2434-2440PubMed Google Scholar). The naturally occurring antagonist IL-1ra plays an important role in physiological regulation of IL-1-induced activities. The three IL-1 ligands, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1ra, bind to the two IL-1 receptors (IL-1R), type I and type II (1Dinarello C.A. FASEB J... 1994; 8: 1314-1325Google Scholar). Only the type I receptor induces signaling upon binding of IL-1α or -β. The type II receptor appears to act as a negative regulator of activity by effectively competing for binding of ligand and thus regulating IL-1 concentrations (4Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F. Re F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K.H. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6155-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The type II receptor released from cells selectively binds IL-1β or -α over IL-1ra, therefore having little effect on the inhibitory action of the antagonist (5Symons J.A. Young P.R. Duff G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).IL-1 antagonists, including IL-1ra and soluble IL-1R, have been therapeutically effective in animal models of inflammatory disease and are currently in human trials. Recent studies have shown that IL-1ra can reduce some of the symptoms of established disease in model systems, bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis in rats (6Makarov S.S. Olsen J.C. Johnston W.N. Anderle S.K. Brown R.R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Haskill J.S. Schwab J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cytokine. 1993; 5: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A small, active IL-1 antagonist would have several advantages over the recombinant IL-1ra protein including ease of synthesis, the ability to deliver locally in high concentrations, and possible oral delivery. We have screened large libraries of recombinant peptides in search of IL-1 receptor antagonists. The peptide described here, AF12198, is derived from a family of peptide antagonists we recently reported (9Yanofsky S.D. Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P.

AF12198, Ac-FEWTPGWYQJYALPL-NH2, binds specifically to the human type I IL-1R and blocks both in vitro and in vivo IL-1-induced activities. This peptide is the first low molecular weight IL-1 receptor antagonist to show in vivo activity.DISCUSSIONIn our search for small IL-1 antagonists we have screened diverse recombinant peptide libraries and found a peptide family that specifically binds with high affinity to the human type I IL-1 receptor. We have characterized in vitro and in vivo activities of one of the most potent of these peptides, AF12198, Ac-FEWTPGWYQJYALPL-NH2. AF12198 inhibits IL-1-induced in vitro events at an effective molar concentration 1000-fold higher than for IL-1ra. Like IL-1ra, AF12198 has no agonist activity.This is the first example of a small, low molecular weight IL-1R antagonist with in vivo antagonist activity. When we followed in vivo activity in cynomolgus monkeys, we found that infusion of the peptide did reduce IL-1 induction of IL-6 in four of six animals. However, AF12198 infusion did not affect the response of two of the test animals, both low responders to IL-1. Several factors seem to be contributing to the marginal in vivo activity of AF12198 in this system. First, rapid metabolism limited the effective plasma concentration of AF12198. Analysis of plasma steady state levels of AF12198 revealed that the peptide was rapidly degraded by endopeptidase activity to two nonactive metabolites, Ac-FEWTPGWYQJY-OH and Ac-FEWTPG-OH. This metabolism was also reflected in the rapid decline in plasma concentrations of AF12198 once infusion was ended. As a consequence of the rapid metabolism, we were able to achieve a plasma concentration of active peptide of only 4 to 5 nmol/ml. When IL-1ra was administered with the same protocol, at a concentration of IL-1ra which completely blocked the response to the IL-1β bolus, steady state plasma concentrations of 35 pmol/ml were attained, and at the end of the infusion IL-1ra levels declined much more slowly than AF12198. If the results from the in vitro cell-based assays are an accurate predictor of in vivo efficacy, we needed to achieve a plasma peptide molar concentration 1000-fold higher than IL-1ra to get comparable activity. Therefore, we would need to achieve a plasma concentration of AF12198 of 35 nmol/ml, 7-fold higher than detected in the in vivo system. Unfortunately, the poor solubility of the peptide limited the dose that could be administered in this model system.We were able to show that AF12198 does bind IL-1R in vivo, by using an ex vivo format, where cynomolgus monkeys could be treated with an infusion of the same dose of AF12198, but administered over a shorter period. With this protocol, a mean AF12198 plasma concentration of 72 nmol/ml was reached. This concentration completely blocked IL-1-induced activity ex vivo. Again, the two metabolites, 11-mer and 6-mer, were detected in plasma samples at the end of the 15-min infusion. Because we were able to deliver a high volume of AF12198 with a short infusion, the plasma concentration of active peptide was sufficient to block the functional effects of IL-1 binding. We are currently testing AF12198 analogs with modifications designed to limit proteolysis and increase solubility.IL-1 has shown no species specificity for receptor binding although some differences in induction of biological activity have been reported (14Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1991; 77: 1627-1652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human IL-1 clearly binds murine type I IL-1R and induces a variety of biological activities. However, analysis of a series of IL-1β muteins has shown different binding affinities and activation characteristics for human and murine receptors (15Grütter M.G. van Oostrum J. Priestle J.P. Edelmann E. Joss U. Feige U. Vosbeck K. Schmitz A. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Surface regions involved in binding appear to be distinct, suggesting that the complementary sites on each of the receptors are also distinct. This may explain the receptor selectivity of AF12198. The site where AF12198 binds to the human type I IL-1R is either not present on the human type II and murine type I receptors or is not essential for binding of ligand. That AF12198 does not bind the human type II receptor is a pharmacological advantage. The soluble type II IL-1R binds pro-IL-1β and IL-1β with high affinity and IL-1α with lower affinity but binds IL-1ra with greatly reduced activity (5Symons J.A. Young P.R. Duff G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This provides a mechanism for blocking activation by limiting circulating levels of IL-1β but not IL-1ra. Since AF12198 does not bind the type II receptor, the peptide does not compromise this regulatory interaction.Recent mutagenesis studies (16Labriola-Tompkins E. Chandran C. Kaffka K.L. Biondi D.

The agonists, IL-1β and -α, possess two main surface sites, A and B, which interact with the receptors (17Evans R.J. Bray J. Childs J.D. Vigers G.P.A. Brandhuber B.J. Skalicky J.J. Thompson R.C.

IL-1ra has only site A and thus has no agonist activity. Residues within site A identified by Evans et al. (17Evans R.J. Bray J. Childs J.D. Vigers G.P.A. Brandhuber B.J. Skalicky J.J. Thompson R.C.

In the three-dimensional models of the ligands, the site A residues are clustered at the open end of the β-barrel. We have also been successful in the co-crystallization of IL-1ra and the soluble extracellular domain of the human type I IL-1R (22Schreuder H.A. Tradif C. Soffientini A. Sarubbi E. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Yanofsky S. Barrett R.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 39-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Analysis of the model of bound IL-1R derived from the co-crystal show that the Trp-16, Gln-20, Tyr-34, Gln-36, and Tyr-147, identified by Evans et al. (17Evans R.J. Bray J. Childs J.D. Vigers G.P.A.

Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P. Chinn J.P. Cwirla S.E. Peters-Bhatt E. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E.H. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7381-7386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the immediate amino-terminal residues of active AF12198 analogs are most frequently aromatics. Computer modeling of the WYQJY core of AF12198 indicates that the peptide can adopt a conformation similar to the A site-critical residues of IL-1ra. The identification of AF12198 from screening large libraries, combined with structural information derived from crystallography and NMR of the human type I receptor and molecular modeling, provides powerful tools for structure-based drug design. We are currently designing small peptidomimetic molecules as potential antagonists based on the model of the bound conformation of AF12198.With AF12198 we have shown that a small molecule can block in vivo IL-1-induced activity. However, direct therapeutic use of AF12198 or related analogs will be limited due to rapid metabolism and poor pharmacokinetics. The value of AF12198 is as a tool in understanding pharmacophores important for antagonist activity and as a model for rational structure-based design of low molecular weight peptidomimetic antagonists. INTRODUCTIONA wide range of immune and inflammatory responses are influenced by the cytokine IL-1 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1interleukin-1IL-1rainterleukin-1 receptor antagonistIL-1Rinterleukin-1 receptorJl-azetidine-2-carboxylic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayICAM-1intercellular adhesion molecule-1IL-8interleukin-8IL-6interleukin-6. (1Dinarello C.A. FASEB J... 1994; 8: 1314-1325Google Scholar). The two agonists IL-1α and IL-1β can cause both local and systemic inflammatory responses. Prolonged expression of even low levels of IL-1 can have detrimental consequences in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (2Arend W.P. Dayer J.-M. Arthritis & Rheum. 1995; 33: 151-160Crossref Scopus (927) Google Scholar) and inflammatory bowel disease (3Casini-Raggi V. Kam L. Chong Y.J.T. Fiocchi C. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2434-2440PubMed Google Scholar). The naturally occurring antagonist IL-1ra plays an important role in physiological regulation of IL-1-induced activities. The three IL-1 ligands, IL-1α, IL-1β and IL-1ra, bind to the two IL-1 receptors (IL-1R), type I and type II (1Dinarello C.A. FASEB J... 1994; 8: 1314-1325Google Scholar). Only the type I receptor induces signaling upon binding of IL-1α or -β. The type II receptor appears to act as a negative regulator of activity by effectively competing for binding of ligand and thus regulating IL-1 concentrations (4Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F. Re F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K.H. Dower S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6155-6159Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The type II receptor released from cells selectively binds IL-1β or -α over IL-1ra, therefore having little effect on the inhibitory action of the antagonist (5Symons J.A. Young P.R. Duff G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).IL-1 antagonists, including IL-1ra and soluble IL-1R, have been therapeutically effective in animal models of inflammatory disease and are currently in human trials. Recent studies have shown that IL-1ra can reduce some of the symptoms of established disease in model systems, bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis in rats (6Makarov S.S. Olsen J.C. Johnston W.N. Anderle S.K. Brown R.R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Haskill J.S. Schwab J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Dis. 1995; 54: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and lung fibrosis in mice (8Piquet P.F. Vesin C. Grau G.E. Thompson R.C. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A small, active IL-1 antagonist would have several advantages over the recombinant IL-1ra protein including ease of synthesis, the ability to deliver locally in high concentrations, and possible oral delivery. We have screened large libraries of recombinant peptides in search of IL-1 receptor antagonists. The peptide described here, AF12198, is derived from a family of peptide antagonists we recently reported (9Yanofsky S.D. Baldwin D.N. Butler J.H. Holden F.R. Jacobs J.W. Balasubramanian P. Chinn J.P. Cwirla S.E. Peters-Bhatt E. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E.H. Akeson A. Bowlin T.L. Dower W.J. Barrett R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AF12198, Ac-FEWTPGWYQJYALPL-NH2, binds specifically to the human type I IL-1R and blocks both in vitro and in vivo IL-1-induced activities. This peptide is the first low molecular weight IL-1 receptor antagonist to show in vivo activity."

This cAMP-induced facilitation is consistent with the induction of spontaneous action potentials that are abolished by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin and by reducing nerve terminal excitability with arachidonic acid. We have also demonstrated that a β-adrenergic receptor is linked to this pathway because isoproterenol increases cAMP levels and glutamate release, and both actions are antagonized by the receptor antagonist propanolol and the protein kinase A inhibitors H89 and 8-chloroadenosine 3′,5′-monophosphorothioate ((Rp)-isomer).

A number of secretory proteins enter the ER by virtue of a cleavable N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence (1Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol... 1975; 67: 835-851Google Scholar). Once the signal sequence has emerged from a cytosolic ribosome, the secretory protein can bind to the signal recognition particle (SRP), which helps target the protein to the translocation apparatus on the ER membrane (2Meyer D.I.

In yeast, this coupling of translation and translocation is not obligatory, as certain secretory proteins, such as α-factor and carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), can be translocated posttranslationally in vitro (4Hansen W.

Regardless of the pathway, the secretory protein is translocated through a translocation apparatus comprised of several integral membrane proteins.

Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), although the exact role of hsp70s in the translocation mechanism remains controversial (16Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Here we describe the partial characterization of a novel yeast protein (open reading frame #YKL073) (17Rasmussen S.W. Yeast. 1994; 10: S69-S74Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) that has homology to the hsp70 family. We have named the protein Cer1p, for chaperone in the ER. As shown below, CER1p affects the import of a subset of secretory proteins, those able to translocate posttranslationally. GHY1 containing the CER1 disruption was created as follows. Two oligonucleotide DNA primers were constructed containing at the 5′ ends, 40 base pairs of CER1 sequence immediately flanking the predicted CER1 open reading frame and 20 base pairs identical to the pRS306 sequence upstream and downstream of the URA3 gene. A polymerase chain reaction was performed using these primers and the pRS306 plasmid to generate a URA3 fragment with 40 base pairs of CER1 DNA flanking the gene. This fragment was used to transform SEY6210 (leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3Δ200 trp1Δ901 lys2-801 MATα) to uracil prototrophy. The insertion was verified by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the URA3 gene using primers from flanking regions of the CER1 gene. GHY2 is a cer1::URA3 and was constructed as described above from the pep4 parent strain LCY22 (MATα leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 his3Δ200 trp1Δ901 lys2-801 pep4). The CER1 gene was disrupted as described previously in the strain MY767 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3, 112 ade2 his 4 kar2-1) which was generously provided by Mark Rose, Princeton University to create GHY3, a cer1Δ kar2-1 strain. Yeast strain GHY2, used in this experiment, is cer1::URA3. The CER1 strain used in this experiment is LCY22. Equal aliquots of cells were harvested in log phase and total cellular protein was isolated as described previously (18Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague G.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies against α-factor, CPY, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase B (DPAP-B), and invertase were generously provided by Tom Stevens. The anti-Kar2 antibody was generously provided by Mark Rose. Detection of the primary antibody was accomplished with secondary antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase and visualized using chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce). GHY1 was transformed with the 2μ-based plasmid YEpSCJ1 (19Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) which contains the SCJ1 open reading frame and was the generous gift of Pamela Silver, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School. Cell cultures of the GHY2 (cer1Δ pep4) strain were grown to mid log phase, equal aliquots of cells were spheroplasted for 30 min at 30°C by addition of lyticase (10 μg/ml) in supportive buffer (1.2 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaN3, 3%β-mercaptoethanol). The spheroplasts were pelleted (650 × g, 5 min) and resuspended in nonsupportive buffer (0.2 M sorbitol, 25 mM NaPO4 pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2) and osmotically lysed by incubation on ice for 20 min. Unlysed cells and cell debris were pelleted (500 × g, 5 min). The resulting supernatant contained intact internal membranes (as assayed by Kar2p inaccessibility to externally added proteases in the absence of detergent) and cytosol. Treatment of this fraction with proteases and detergent was carried out as described previously (20Deshaies R. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A protease mixture of trypsin and proteinase K (1:1 by mass) was added to final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and allowed to digest for 20 min at room temperature. Protease reactions were stopped by addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20%. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C) the pellets were resuspended and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted, as described above. CER1 is predicted to encode a hydrophilic 100-kDa protein (Fig. 1), possessing both an N-terminal signal sequence, for transport into the ER, and a C-terminal ER retention signal (-HDEL). Therefore the Cer1 protein (Cer1p) is expected to reside in the lumen of the ER. The predicted N-terminal region of Cer1p (44 kDa) has significant homology (17% amino acid identity, 27% similarity) to the N-terminal ATPase domain of Kar2p and other hsp70s, including several 5-7 residue spans of exact identity. Amino acids predicted to contact the bound ATP (noted with an asterisk in Fig. 1) (21Flaherty K.M. Deluca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Science. 1990; 346: 623-628Google Scholar) are particularly well conserved. Actin and hexokinase, proteins known to share a similar three-dimensional fold with the hsp70 N-terminal domain, do not show significant homology to hsp70s or Cer1p and have no spans of homology longer than 2 residues. However, it should be noted that Cer1p is not a traditional member of the hsp70 family of molecular chaperones. In addition to the greater size, Cer1p does not display any observable homology to the highly conserved peptide binding domain of traditional hsp70s. Bacterial and eukaryotic hsp70s, for example, are over 50% identical in a 17-kDa region of the peptide binding domain (residues 385-545 of DnaK) (22Wang T.-F. Chang J. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26049-26051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript a molecular characterization of this open reading frame was published (23Craven R.A. Egerton M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15(11): 2640-2650Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The authors name the gene LHS1, for lumenal hsp70 homolog. Our sequence analysis does not find the same degree of homology as reported by these authors, and we do not find homology extending beyond the ATP binding domain. Since homology is not found within the well conserved peptide binding domain of hsp70s, Cer1p does not share all the features of the hsp70 family and should not be considered an hsp70 homolog. To examine the function of Cer1p we disrupted the gene in yeast. Cells lacking the CER1 gene (cer1Δ) grew normally at 30°C (Fig. 2A), the optimal growth temperature for the parent strain, but grew poorly at lower temperatures, as compared to a wild type CER1 strain (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that either Cer1p has an important function only at lower temperatures, or other proteins can compensate for the loss of Cer1p at 30°C. Investigation of a possible mating defect in cer1Δ cells of mating type α led to the discovery of decreased secretion of the mating pheromone α-factor. Since Cer1p is predicted to reside in the ER lumen, and the ER-hsp70 Kar2p is essential for translocation, we tested whether the secretory defect was due to a translocation block of the α-factor precursor (ppαf) into the ER. At the restrictive temperature (18°C), the ppαf accumulated in cer1Δ cells (Fig. 3A). This accumulation was more pronounced at 18°C than at 30°C. Since increased levels of ppαf could have resulted from either an inhibition of signal sequence cleavage in the ER or from a failure of the protein to cross the ER membrane, we probed the intracellular location of ppαf by protease sensitivity (Fig. 3B). Outer membranes of yeast cells were partially disrupted by homogenization following cell wall removal. After such treatment, the ppαf that accumulated in cer1Δ cells could be degraded with the proteases proteinase K and trypsin under conditions in which the ER lumenal protein Kar2p remained protease resistant. Only following detergent treatment did Kar2p become sensitive to proteolytic attack, indicating the ER membranes were intact following lysis of the plasma membrane. Therefore, ppαf accumulated due to a translocation block in cer1Δ cells. To determine whether loss of Cer1p affected ER translocation universally, we examined the processing of other well characterized secretory proteins: CPY, which like ppαf translocates posttranslationally, and DPAP-B and invertase, which translocate cotranslationally (6Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 7Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Ngsee J.K. Hansen W. Walter P. Smith M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3400-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 2T. G. Hamilton, unpublished data. Mature CPY is a glycosylated vacuolar protein. In pep4 strains the final proteolytic processing of CPY is blocked and the vacuolar glycosylated form, which migrates at a rate corresponding to a 69-kDa protein, can be electrophoretically separated from unglycosylated forms (25Stevens T.H. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 438-439Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In cer1Δ pep4 cells we observed a second, faster migrating form (60 kDa) of CPY (Fig. 3A). As with ppαf, this accumulation was greater at 18°C than at 30°C. This faster migrating species is the untranslocated preproCPY (ppCPY), since endoglycosidase H treatment increased the mobility of the 69-kDa form but not the 60-kDa form (data not shown). In addition, the glycosylated ER form of CPY, termed p1 (25Stevens T.H. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 438-439Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (371) Google Scholar) could be observed in both cer1Δ and CER1 cells, but migrated more slowly than ppCPY. The conversion of p1 to the vacuolar p2 form observed in pulse-chase experiments occurred at the same rate in CER1 and cer1Δ cells, indicating that Golgi glycosyl processing and sorting to the vacuole are not affected by loss of Cer1p function (data not shown). In contrast to ppCPY and ppαf, the import of both DPAP-B and invertase were unaffected in the cer1Δ strain at all temperatures tested (Fig. 3C). Craven et al. (23Craven R.A. Egerton M. Stirling C.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15(11): 2640-2650Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reported a translocation defect in lhs1Δ deletion stains (cer1Δ). They also observed the accumulation of precursor proteins in cells lacking functional Cer1p. But because the secretory proteins chosen in their study could not be easily classified according to their translocation pathway, the authors were unable to conclude that Lhs1p (Cer1p) functioned only in posttranslational translocation. Because of the sequence similarity and functional relationship between Cer1p and Kar2p, we generated kar2 cer1 double mutants to probe possible genetic interactions. As seen in Fig. 4A, a strain harboring defects in both kar2 (12Rose M.D. Misra L.M. Vogel J.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and cer1 (kar2-1 cer1Δ) grew more slowly at 30°C than cells carrying mutations in either cer1 or kar2 alone. When cer1Δ was combined with other mutations (e.g. cne1Δ; the yeast calnexin gene) such synthetic growth defects were not observed (data not shown). In Escherichia coli, the co-chaperone hsp40 (or DnaJ) acts in concert with hsp70 (DnaK) in folding and replication functions (26Rassow J. Voos W. Pfanner N. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 207-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Similar hsp70-hsp40 pairs have been demonstrated in various compartments in yeast (27Way J.C. Silver P.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 5-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Only one soluble hsp40 has been identified in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, termed Scj1p (28Blumberg H. Silver P.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Genetic interactions between KAR2 and SCJ1 suggest that the protein products of these two genes function as an hsp70-hsp40 pair in the ER (19Schlenstedt G. Harris S. Risse B. Lill R. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Interestingly, addition of a multicopy plasmid bearing the SCJ1 gene eliminates the ppαf translocation defect in a cer1Δ strain (Fig. 4B). Since deletion of SCJ1 has no effect on translocation, 3P. Silver and T. G. Hamilton, unpublished data. Scj1p is likely either regulating the activity of Cer1p directly, or is decreasing the effect of a cer1Δ by regulating the activity of Kar2p. The secretory proteins that require Cer1p function (ppαf, ppCPY) have previously been shown to translocate posttranslationally in vitro and have relatively weak signal sequences whereas the proteins that are unaffected by loss of Cer1p function (preinvertase, preDPAP-B) translocate co-translationally and possess stronger signal sequences. While it remains possible that other unknown differences between these two sets of proteins underlie the different requirements for Cer1p, the translocation pathway is the most obvious and striking difference. The correlation with SRP independence is not strong however, since translocation of preinvertase not severely affected in yeast lacking SRP. Since the translated N-terminal domain of preinvertase does not aggregate or fold upon emergence from the ribosome it may not require co-translational SRP interactions (7Johnsson N. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2686-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our translocation results are remarkably similar to those seen with mutations in Sec63p, an integral membrane protein and part of a translocation apparatus (10Deshaies R.J. Sanders S.L. Feldheim D.A. Schekman R. Nature. 1991; 349: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Yeast possessing a temperature sensitive mutation in sec63 accumulate unprocessed ppαf, ppCPY, but not preinvertase or preDPAP-B (6Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Why would only a subset of secretory proteins be affected by mutations in the translocation apparatus? A possible answer may be in the recent discovery of a second ER translocation apparatus in yeast, proposed to function solely in the cotranslational import pathway (29Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although Sec63p and associated proteins may be utilized in both co- and posttranslational import, there may be sufficient levels of this second cotranslational import apparatus to prevent accumulation of preDPAP-B and preinvertase in sec63 strains. In contrast with these results, the related protein Kar2p has been shown to affect the import of secretory proteins in both pathways (15Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 30Brodsky J.L. Goeckeler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The combination of a kar2 temperature sensitive mutation with a deletion of the cer1 gene (kar2-1 cer1Δ) lead to a severe growth defect, suggesting overlapping functions of the two gene products in posttranslational translocation. How does an ER lumenal protein affect a targeting process assumed to be entirely cytosolic? One possibility is that Cer1p functions with only the Sec63p containing translocation complex, but not with the cotranslational translocation complex. Another possibility is that the posttranslational import pathway has a greater requirement for ER chaperones to assist in the translocation process. Cotranslational transport could be less dependent on ER chaperones by virtue of the ribosome attachment. The ribosome could either aid directly in translocation, by generating the force required for protein movement through the membrane, or aid indirectly by linking translation, and therefore folding, to the translocation process. Either way, differences between the two import pathways extend to the lumenal side of the ER membrane. Cer1p is the first member of a new class of hsp70 like proteins that are involved in organelle import. If Cer1p interacts directly with a translocating polypeptide, as has been shown for Kar2p, it binds through a novel peptide binding domain. It remains to be tested whether this protein displays other hsp70 chaperone functions, such as assisting in protein folding or targeting proteins for degradation.

This domain, which contains a pair of YXXL/I sequences (where X corresponds to a variable residue), is known as antigen recognition activation motif, activation receptor homology-1, tyrosine-based activation motif, or immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (13Reth M. Nature. 1989; 338: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). This sequence, which is triplicated in ζ and present as a single copy in each of the other CD3 chains, has an important role in coupling the TCR·CD3-mediated signaling to intracellular signal transduction molecules (14Straus D.B. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, how the TCRαβ clonotypic receptor is able to deliver signaling events to the other chains of the complex after its stimulation by an antigen remains to be solved. Due to the short length of the cytoplasmic tails and to the apparent lack of inherent signaling activity of both clonotypic chains, it is assumed that the TCR heterodimer transmits the signals produced upon antigen binding through the CD3 chains. TCR and CD3 domains involved in TCR·CD3 complex assembly could also be good candidates to mediate interactions required for signal transduction. In this regard, transmembrane domains of the TCR and CD3 chains have been shown to play a crucial role in assembly, partly due to charge neutralization between the basic residues of TCRβ, TCRα (or TCRγ and TCRδ), and the acidic residues of each one of the CD3 chains (1Chan A.C. Irving B.A. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 2Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Malissen B. Schmitt-Verhulst H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, additional residues must participate to add specificity to the interaction. The location in the transmembrane region of TCRβ of a conserved ITAM-like motif, which is also present in TCRγ but not in TCRα or TCRδ, prompted us to search for the role this sequence could play in assembly, surface expression, and function of the TCR·CD3 complex, as a possible first signal transducer after TCR stimulation. Although clones that expressed high levels of the TCR·CD3 complex on the cell surface were obtained, the mutation of the C-terminal tyrosine of the ITAM-like motif in TCRβ resulted in an impaired CD3ζ assembly. Surprisingly, stimulation of MUT clones through the TCR·CD3 complex resulted specifically in defective induction of programmed cell death, whereas other activation read outs were normal, including IL-2 secretion, IL-2Rα (CD25), and CD69 expression and down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex. These results suggest a specific role of CD3ζ in TCR·CD3-induced apoptosis. 31.13 is a TCRβ-negative Jurkat mutant kindly provided by Dr. A. Alcover (Institut Pasteur, Paris) (15Alcover A.

JR2, an anti-TCR Vβ8 mAb, was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-human CD95 mAbs, CH-11 and DX2, were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. FITC-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse Igs and human CD3 were purchased from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). The HA1.7 β chain cDNA (Vβ3) was a gift from Dr. M. Owen (EMBL/GenBank accession number X63456). It was derived from the HA1.7 human CD4+ T cell clone specific for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide 307-319 in the context of HLA-DR1. For cloning into the pSRα expression vector, XhoI and BamHI restriction sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the HA1.7 β chain cDNA. Full WT cDNA was PCR-amplified by using, as amplification primers, the 5′-sense oligonucleotide CCCCTCGAGCCATGGGAATCAGGCTC (oligo 1), which included the XhoI site, and the 3′-antisense oligonucleotide GGGGGATCCAGGGCTGCCTTCAG (oligo 4), which included the BamHI site. The construction of the full MUT cDNA involved the following steps. 1) Generation of a PCR-amplified product from the 5′-end of the molecule to the nucleotide 892. Mutations at positions 881 and 882 were introduced by using the 3′-antisense oligonucleotide CAGCACAGCAAGCAGGGTGGC (oligo 2) which included the changes (underlined and boldface) A/T and T/C to produce the desired Tyr/Leu change. Oligo 1 was used as sense primer for the amplification. 2) Generation of a PCR-amplified product from position 872 to the 3′-end of the cDNA. It was carried out by using the oligonucleotide GCCACCCTGCTTGCTGTGCTG (oligo 3) as 5′-sense primer which is complementary to oligo 2, and the oligo 4 previously described as 3′- antisense primer. 3) Generation of the full cDNA MUT. It was achieved by mixing purified PCR products derived from steps 1 and 2, taking into account that they have complementary tails, and performing a PCR with oligo 1 and oligo 4 as amplification primers. In all cases, 25 amplification cycles were performed, each consisting of 1 min at 94°C, 2 min at 55°C, 2 min at 72°C, and a single final extension of 5 min at 72°C. Full PCR-derived XhoI/BamHI-tailored cDNAs, WT and MUT, were isolated, cloned into pSRα expression vector previously digested with XhoI and BamHI, and fully sequenced in Sequagel gels (National Diagnostics, Hessle, UK) by the Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) method. DNA-mediated gene transfer into 31.13 cells was accomplished by electroporation. 5 × 106 cells were mixed with 40 μg of DNA in a sterile disposable cuvette (Bio-Rad) in a volume of 0.8 ml of RPMI 1640 and electroporated in a Bio-Rad gene pulser unit at 250 V and 960 microfarads. After electroporation, the cells were immediately resuspended in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 (Bio-Whitakker) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were plated in 96-well flat bottom plates at 2 × 104 cells/well in selective medium containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). After 3-4 weeks, the growing cells were screened by flow cytometry for surface expression of CD3 (UCHT1), Vβ3 (JOVI-3), and Vβ8 (JR2). 105-106 cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with a specific mAb (2-4 μg/ml) in PBS, washed, and incubated for additional 30 min with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. After washing, the cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (EPICS-XL MCL, Coulter). 105 cells/well were stimulated with soluble UCHT1 or JOVI-3 at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 μg/ml in the presence of 10 ng/ml PMA. After 24 h, 100 μl of culture supernatant were removed from each well and frozen to ensure that no viable cells remained. The IL-2 content of these supernatants was determined in a CTLL2 proliferation assay. CTLL2 were seeded at 104 cells/well in a 1:2 dilution of the culture supernatants, and 24 h later the cells were pulsed for 6 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK) per well. Cells were harvested, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. 2 × 104 cells/well were stimulated with plastic-bound mAbs UCHT1, JOVI.3, or soluble SEB at different concentrations. After 48 h, viable and dead cells were counted in a hemocytometer in the presence of 0.25% trypan blue. Antibody-coated plastic wells were prepared by overnight incubation of 96-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with various concentrations of purified mAb in PBS at 4°C. 2.5 × 105 cells/well were incubated at 37°C for 20 h with different concentrations of soluble SEB or for 4 h with 10 μg/ml JOVI-3. Cells were washed, stained with a FITC-conjugated CD3 mAb, and analyzed by flow cytometry. 2 × 104 cells/well were stimulated for 48 h with soluble SEB, ranging from 1 to 100 μg/ml, or with anti-CD95 mAb at 500 ng/ml. They were then harvested from culture and permeabilized in 500 μl of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml RNase, in PBS. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with 1 μM A23187 plus 15 ng/ml PMA for 24 h. After vortexing, samples were allowed to equilibrate at 4°C in the dark for at least 1 h before being analyzed. Propidium iodide fluorescence analysis was performed by flow cytometry (EPICS-XL MCL, Coulter). 20 × 106 cells/ml were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without cysteine and methionine in the presence of [35S]methionine (0.5 mCi/ml). After labeling, the cells were lysed in 1% Brij 96 (Sigma) lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were pre-cleared twice with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using specific antibodies pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose beads as described (16Salmerón A. Borroto A. Fresno M. Crumpton M.J. Ley S.C. Alarcón B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1675-1683PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance the detection of ζ, the cells were pretreated with the water-soluble Bolton-Hunter reagent before radioiodination. Briefly, 20 × 106 cells were washed with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS plus 200 ng/ml of sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate (Pierce), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by diluting the cells with 10 ml of 10 mM L-lysine in PBS. The cells were centrifuged and 125I-labeled by the lactoperoxidase method and subsequently lysed and immunoprecipitated as above. Total RNAs (15-20 μg/lane) were run on 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen, DuPont NEN), prehybridized, and hybridized at 65°C in 6 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. For hybridization, 2 × 106 cpm/ml of random priming or nick translation 32P-labeled probe were added. The specific human Vβ3 gene segment probe was PCR-derived from the HA1.7 β chain cDNA by using oligo 1 (see above) as sense primer and the oligonucleotide 5′-ATATGAGAAATAGATCAG as antisense primer. Full-length HA1.7 TCRα cDNA (17Hewitt C.R.A. Lamb J.R. Hayball J. Hill M. Owen M.J. O'Hehir R.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1493-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) was used as the TCRα probe. A 486-base pair fragment derived by PCR from murine CD95L cDNA (18Takahashi T. Tanaka M. Brannan C.I. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Suda T. Nagata S. Cell. 1994; 76: 969-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar) was a gift from A. Ortiz (Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid). Blots were stripped and subsequently rehybridized with other probes, including 28 S probe to account for RNA loading variations. Exposed films were scanned with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The comparison between the amino acid sequences of the transmembrane domains of TCRβ chains from different species (Fig. 1) shows a high degree of homology, therefore suggesting that this domain plays a role other than anchoring the chain in the cell membrane. The extent of residue conservation in this domain is much lower when TCRβ is compared with TCRγ, its analogue chain in γδ T cells. Interestingly, an ITAM-like motif, as defined by the sequence (YXXLXXXXXXYXXL/I), is present only in the transmembrane domains of TCRβ and TCRγ, whereas the tyrosine residues of the motif are absent in TCRα and TCRδ. It is significant, however, that in TCRα both tyrosine residues are conservatively substituted by phenylalanine residues. To investigate the putative role of the TCRβ ITAM-like motif, its C-terminal tyrosine residue (named Tyr-TM11) was mutated to leucine using a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol. WT and MUT versions of TCRβ HA1.7 cDNA were transfected into the 31-13 TCRβ minus Jurkat mutant cells previously described (15Alcover A. Alberini A. Acuto O. Clayton L.K. Transy C. Spagnoli G.C. Moingeon P. López P. Reinherz E.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). After selection in the presence of G-418, WT and MUT TCRβ transfectants were analyzed by flow cytofluorimetry using UCHT1 mAb to determine whether transfection of TCRβ chain cDNA had reconstituted the expression of the TCR·CD3 complex. As shown in Fig. 2, WT clones expressed surface TCR/CD3, with a mean percentage of positive cells of 58%. On the other hand, MUT clones expressed, on average, only 25% positive cells. In this regard, Fig. 2 shows a clustering of the WT clones in the 60-80% positive region while MUT clones remain in the 10-30% region. The reduced surface expression of the TCR·CD3 complex in clones containing the mutated TCRβ suggests that this protein does not efficiently reconstitute the TCR·CD3 complex. To further analyze the possible functional implication of Tyr-TM11, three MUT clones expressing high levels of TCR·CD3 were used in comparative experiments with three WT clones expressing similar levels of the complex. All six clones were positive not only with UCHT1 but also with the anti-Vβ3 mAb JOVI-3, which recognizes the variable region of the transfected TCRβ HA1.7. On the contrary, none of the clones were stained with a specific Vβ8 antibody, showing that TCR·CD3 expression in these clones had not resulted from a reversion and reexpression of endogenous Jurkat's TCRβ. Other T cell markers were equally expressed in all clones, and, as expected, HLA class II molecules were not detected on the surface of Jurkat, 31-13, and transfected cells (data not shown). To investigate the causes of the possible assembly defect, WTB7 and MUTC2 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h, and their lysates were immunoprecipitated with CD3ϵ and TCRβ-specific mAbs. As shown in Fig. 3A, JOVI-3 immunoprecipitated a TCRα/β heterodimer from WTB7 cells that had the mobility of the mature Golgi processed form. However, in MUTC2 cells, JOVI-3 mainly immunoprecipitated a TCRα/β heterodimer that migrated with the characteristic mobility of the immature heterodimer located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (19Alarcon B. Berkhout B. Breitmeyer J. Terhost C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2953-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some mature TCRα/β heterodimer was also detected in MUTC2 cells, accounting for the surface staining of these cells. In addition to the mature and immature heterodimer, large amounts of unassociated TCRβ chain were detected in the MUTC2 clone (spot in the diagonal, Fig. 3A) but not in WTB7 cells. The immunoprecipitation with the CD3ϵ-specific mAb SP34 showed that in MUTC2 cells the immature form of the TCRα/β heterodimer was CD3-associated. This result suggests that mutation of Tyr-TM11 does not affect the ability of TCRβ to associate with TCRα or CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ but results in an impaired exit of the TCR·CD3 complex from the ER. The ER location of most of the TCR·CD3 complex in MUTC2 cells is suggested by the dominant presence in the immunoprecipitate of immature TCRα/β heterodimer, which has been previously shown to be endo-H-sensitive (19Alarcon B. Berkhout B. Breitmeyer J. Terhost C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2953-2961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, confocal microscopy of JOVI-3-stained WTB7 and MUTC2 cells confirmed that in MUTC2 the TCR·CD3 complex was mostly located in the ER (data not shown). Nevertheless, enough complex should leak out of the ER to allow high expression on the cell surface. The export deficit produced by the mutation in TCRβ could be compensated in MUTC2 cells by the overwhelming expression of the TCRβ chain. In this regard, an RNA blot analysis with a Vβ3-specific probe showed that the transfected mRNA is expressed at 5-fold higher levels in MUTC2 than in WTB7 cells (Fig. 3B). The hampered transport of the TCR·CD3 complex from the ER in MUTC2 is compatible with a deficit in the association of CD3ζ chain which has been suggested to be the last step in the assembly of the TCR·CD3 complex (9Weissman A.M. Frank S.J. Orloff D.G. Mercep M. Ashwell J.D. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3651-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Blumberg R.S. Sancho J. Ley S.C. McDermott F.V. Tan K. Breitmeyer J. Terhost C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Indeed, although some CD3ζ homodimer was detected in metabolic labelings of WTB7 cells (Fig. 3A), none was detectable in MUTC2. However, due to the poor labeling of CD3ζ, we could not rule out the existence of this subunit. To further explore this possibility, WTB7 and MUTC2 cells were surface iodinated by the lactoperoxidase method prior to exposing the cells to sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate, previously shown to enhance the detection of CD3ζ (16Salmerón A. Borroto A. Fresno M. Crumpton M.J. Ley S.C. Alarcón B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1675-1683PubMed Google Scholar). After iodination, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with CD3ϵ- and CD3ζ-specific mAbs. As shown in Fig. 4, immunoprecipitation with CD3ζ antibody N39 from the WTB7 lysate resulted in the coprecipitation of CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ as well as the TCRα/β heterodimer. On the other hand, although immunoprecipitation with anti-CD3ζ from MUTC2 revealed similar, if not higher, amounts of CD3ζ to those found in WTB7, the amounts of coprecipitated CD3γ, -δ, and -ϵ chains and TCRα/β were highly diminished. Conversely, the immunoprecipitation with a CD3ϵ mAb showed that the levels of CD3γ, -δ, -ϵ, and TCRα/β were similar in WTB7 and MUTC2 cells, while the levels of complex-associated CD3ζ were much lower in MUTC2 than in the WTB7 clone (Fig. 4). These experiments suggest that, on the MUTC2 cell surface, CD3ζ is loosely associated in the TCR·CD3 complex and mostly present as an independent molecule. To test the effect of Tyr-TM11 mutation on TCR/CD3-mediated signaling, MUT and WT clones were stimulated with PMA and different concentrations of soluble UCHT1 mAb; after 24 h, IL-2 production was measured in a CTLL2 proliferation assay. Although some intrinsic variability was found among the different clones, there was not a clear effect of the mutation in the ability of the TCR·CD3 complex to promote IL-2 secretion (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when soluble JOVI-3 mAb; or plastic-bound UCTH-1 and JOVI-3 mAbs were used (data not shown). As expected, the parental TCR·CD3-negative Jurkat mutant 31-13 was unresponsive. However, a very clear effect of Tyr-TM11 mutation on cell viability was observed. Consistently, stimulation with plastic-bound UCHT1 or JOVI-3 mAbs resulted in significant losses of cell viability, in WT clones but not in MUT ones, as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion (Fig. 5B). Upon stimulation with different ligands of the TCR·CD3 complex, a clear dose-response effect on cell viability was observed. That this phenomena is a dose-dependent effect is shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, clone MUTC2 was much less sensitive to stimuli-induced cell death than clone WTB7. Interestingly, soluble Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B (SEB), which has been shown to be a ligand for human TCR Vβ3 (21Kappler J. Kotzin B. Herron L. Gelland E. Bigler R.D. Boylston A. Carrell S. Posnet D.N. Choi Y. Marrack P. Science. 1989; 244: 811-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) even in the absence of class II molecules (17Hewitt C.R.A. Lamb J.R. Hayball J. Hill M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12839-12845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), was able to induce a similar effect (Fig. 6C). The mutation of Tyr-TM11 in TCRβ, therefore, abrogated TCR·CD3-induced cell death but did not affect IL-2 secretion. T cells have been described to undergo apoptosis when stimulated with TCR/CD3 ligands (23Dhein J. Walczak H. Bäumler C. Debatin K. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 24Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D.H. Ware C.F. Green D.R.

Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis is the mechanism underlying cell death in our cell system, WTG7 and MUTC2 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of soluble SEB, and the level of apoptosis was measured by propidium iodide incorporation in the DNA of permeabilized cells. As shown in Fig. 7, SEB stimulation leads to an increase in the number of cells with sub-G1 amounts of DNA in the WTG7 clone, whereas no effect was observed in MUTC2 cells. These results suggest that, upon stimulation, genomic DNA was only degraded in WT cells. Similar results were observed in WT and MUT clones obtained from independent transfections (data not shown). To ascertain whether other activation events were affected by the mutation in TCRβ, clones were stimulated with anti-TCRβ mAb JOVI-3. The expression of activation markers IL-2Rα chain (CD25) and CD69 was then analyzed. As shown in Fig. 8A, JOVI-3 stimulated CD25 and CD69 expression in both MUTC2 and WTB7 cells. Similar results were obtained when these clones were stimulated with UCHT1 or SEB (data not shown). In addition, ligand-induced receptor internalization experiments showed that both JOVI-3 mAb (Fig. 8B) and SEB (not shown) induced down-regulation of the TCR·CD3 complex in WT and MUT cells with similar efficiencies. Taken together, all previous data indicate that mutation of Tyr-TM11 in TCRβ results in a specific inhibition of TCR·CD3-induced apoptosis but has no effect in IL-2 production, CD25 and CD69 expression, and TCR·CD3 complex down-regulation. The pathways for activation of apoptosis are multiple and distinct in different cell types. Recently, it has been described that in T cells, TCR·CD3 cross-linking induces both CD95 (also known as APO-1 and Fas) and CD95 ligand (CD95-L) expression and that TCR·CD3-induced programmed cell death is mediated by engagement of CD95 by its ligand (23Dhein J.

https://openalex.org/W2092491649,"Stimulation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) of NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the EGF receptor (EGFR) results in a release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Ca2+ release is followed by an influx of extracellular calcium which can be recorded by the influx of the calcium surrogate Mn2+. Both Ca2+ release and Mn2+/Ca2+ influx are inhibited by expression of the dominant negative Asn17-Ras mutant and abrogated by microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibody Y13-259, whereas microinjection of the anti-Ras antibody Y13-238 which does not interact with the effector binding domain of Ras is without any effect on the EGF-induced Ca2+ transient. Neither Asn17-Ha-Ras nor the Y13-259 antibody interferes with the thapsigargin-induced Mn2+/Ca2+ influx. The nerve growth factor receptor (Trk)-mediated Ca2+ transient was found to be unaffected by the dominant negative Ras mutant or microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies. Substitution of the phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) binding site of the EGFR by the PLCγ binding domain of Trk renders the EGFR-induced Ca2+ influx insensitive to the expression of Asn17-Ha-Ras, whereas the Ca2+ signal induced by Trk carrying the PLC binding site of EGFR is Ras-dependent and abrogated by the dominant negative Ras mutant. It is concluded that the Ca2+ transient induced by the activated EGFR, not, however, the Ca2+ transient elicited by the activated NGFR/Trk, is a Ras-mediated phenomenon and that the role of Ras in regulating EGFR-induced Ca2+ influx depends on the structure of the PLCγ binding domain.

The nerve growth factor receptor (Trk)-mediated Ca2+ transient was found to be unaffected by the dominant negative Ras mutant or microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies. Substitution of the phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) binding site of the EGFR by the PLCγ binding domain of Trk renders the EGFR-induced Ca2+ influx insensitive to the expression of Asn17-Ha-Ras, whereas the Ca2+ signal induced by Trk carrying the PLC binding site of EGFR is Ras-dependent and abrogated by the dominant negative Ras mutant. It is concluded that the Ca2+ transient induced by the activated EGFR, not, however, the Ca2+ transient elicited by the activated NGFR/Trk, is a Ras-mediated phenomenon and that the role of Ras in regulating EGFR-induced Ca2+ influx depends on the structure of the PLCγ binding domain. In previous reports, we and others had demonstrated that expression of transforming Ha-Ras leads to an enhanced Ca2+ influx (5Maly K. Kindler E. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H.

It remained unclear, however, whether this effect represents a gain-of-function of the mutated Ras protein or whether cellular Ras is also involved in regulating Ca2+ entry mechanisms operating in nontransformed cells stimulated by growth factors which activate Ras-dependent signaling pathways. In order to address this question, Ca2+ transients induced by activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFRepidermal growth factor receptorNGFRnerve growth factor receptorIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePLCphospholipase CETREGFR/Trk. and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR/Trk) were investigated. Both receptors are known to activate Ras and to cause an elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A.

The studies presented here were performed with NIH3T3 cells overexpressing either EGFR or an EGFR/Trk chimeric receptor consisting of an extracellular EGFR domain and the cytosolic domain of Trk as described previously (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This system permits the study of both receptors in the same cellular environment employing the same agonist. In PC12 cells under physiological conditions, EGFR and NGFR induce opposite effects, activation of EGFR elicits proliferation, whereas stimulation of NGFR leads to differentiation (15Obermeier A.

Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4235) Google Scholar). When expressed in fibroblasts, however, activation of NGFR causes a proliferative response (20Cordon Cardo C. Tapley P. Jing S.Q. Nanduri V. O'Rourke E. Lamballe F. Kovary K. Klein R. Jones K.R. Reichardt L.F. Cell. 1991; 66: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Both receptors have been shown to activate a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, resulting in the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Ca2+-release is followed or accompanied by an enhanced influx of Ca2+ through voltage-independent Ca2+ channels of the plasma membrane (21Putney Jr., J.W. Bird G.S. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 610-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 22Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2268) Google Scholar). Although the Ca2+ transients elicited by activation of different receptor tyrosine kinases appear to be rather similar, the underlying mechanisms have been shown to differ in a receptor-specific fashion (23Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries Smits A.M. Qiu R.G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. de Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These differences may result from variations in the contribution of Ca2+ influx to the total Ca2+ transient and the Ca2+ channels involved. The data presented here demonstrate that the Ca2+ influx following activation of EGFR is blocked by expression of a dominant negative (Asn17) mutant of Ha-Ras and abrogated by microinjection of antibodies interacting with the effector binding domain of Ras whereas the Ca2+ influx elicited by an activation of Trk is not affected by Asn17-Ha-Ras or anti-Ras antibody and appears to proceed by a Ras-independent mechanism. In an attempt to identify the mechanism responsible for the differences in signaling by the two receptor types, it was investigated whether the significantly different affinities to phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) described in a preceding publication (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are related to the distinct signal transmission. The studies revealed that an exchange of the phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) binding sites between Trk and EGFR renders the Trk-induced Ca2+ influx Ras-dependent and abolishes the Ras dependence of the EGFR-mediated Ca2+ influx. epidermal growth factor receptor nerve growth factor receptor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phospholipase C EGFR/Trk. Fura-2/AM was obtained from Molecular Probes; culture media and sera were from Boehringer Ingelheim Bioproducts; SK&F96365 was from Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals; EGF and nifedipine were purchased from Sigma; pRSV-Asn17-Ha-Ras was kindly provided by L. de Vries, Laboratory for Physiological Chemistry, University of Utrecht, and pEF-neo GFP-S65T by S. Geley, Institute of Pathology, University of Innsbruck. NIH3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing EGFR (EGFR6), NIH3T3 cells expressing a chimeric EGFR/Trk (ETR2), and NIH3T3 cells expressing the mutant receptors EGF-R.X2 or ET-R.X3 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere (95% air, 5% CO2). The generation and characteristics of NIH3T3 transfectants expressing the mutant receptors ET-R2, EGF-R.X2, or ET-R.X3 had been described in a preceding publication (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). EGF-R.X2 carries the Trk residues 780-790 which had been identified as the PLCγ1 binding site of Trk, in place of the EGFR amino acids 987-997. In ET-R.X3, Trk residues 780-790 were replaced by the EGFR sequence 987-997 which had been characterized as a PLC binding site of EGFR. All cell lines exhibit similar expression levels for the receptors. Biological properties of these cell lines had been described previously (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). EGFR6 and ET-R2 fibroblasts were transfected with circular plasmid DNA (50 μg/ml) by microinjection of single cells. The pipette solution contained 4 parts of pRSV dominant negative Asn17-Ha-Ras (2Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) or empty pRSV vector and 1 part of modified Aequorea green fluorescence protein (GFP-S65T in a pEF-neo vector) (3Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, GFP-positive cells were investigated for [Ca2+]i measurements and fura-2 fluorescence quench by Mn2+. The cells (104/ml) were plated on coverslips (diameter 22 mm) in 35-mm dishes (6-well plates) and cultured for 1 day. Loading with fura-2 was performed by incubation with 1 μM fura-2/AM for 15 min. Then the cells were washed with HEPES buffer (HBS: 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 20 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4) and kept in HEPES buffer at room temperature. For determination of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) employing a single cell imaging system (Magical, Applied Imaging, Sunderland SR53HD, UK, Nikon Diaphot microscope), the coverslip was placed into the recording chamber and the cells were kept in nominally Ca2+-free HEPES buffer (HBS without Ca2+) for 5 min. Where indicated, the cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF or 1 μM thapsigargin. After 1 min, 1 mM CaCl2 was added. The cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was calculated from the ratios of background subtracted images (excitation wavelength 340 and 380 nm, emission wavelength 510 nm) according to the calibration procedure and equations described by Grynkiewicz et al. (4Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This quench was measured as described previously (5Maly K. Kindler E. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Cell Calcium. 1995; 18: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) according to the procedure of Kass et al. (6Kass G.E. Llopis J. Chow S.C. Duddy S.K. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17486-17492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Background subtracted single-cell images (excitation 360 nm, emission 510 nm) were captured, and the fura-2 quench by Mn2+ was calculated as the percentage of fluorescence decrease of the initial fura-2 fluorescence 60 s after addition of 100 μM Mn2+ (final concentration). The initial fluorescence after fura-2 loading was similar in all cells under study (50 ± 10 arbitrary units/cell). Fig. 1A shows a representative single-cell recording of an EGF-induced Ca2+ signal in EGFR6 cells. In order to discriminate between Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx, cells were initially kept in Ca2+-free medium. Addition of EGF leads to a release of Ca2+ from internal stores. After store depletion, Ca2+ was added to the medium. This results in a second peak of intracellular Ca2+ representing Ca2+ influx and release of refilled stores. For a more sensitive determination of calcium influx, the Ca2+ surrogate Mn2+ was employed, and the quench of fura-2-loaded cells by exogenous Mn2+ was determined in a single-cell imaging system. As shown in Table I, this EGF-induced Mn2+ influx is sensitive to the Ca2+ channel blockers SK&F96365 and La3+, but insensitive to nifedipine up to concentrations of 10 μM. These results were likewise obtained by whole-cell patch clamp studies (data not shown).TABLE IEGF-induced Ca2+ influx determined by Mn2+ quenching of fura-2ControlEGF (50 ng/ml)EGF ++SK&F96365 (10 μM)EGF + LaCl (1 mM)EGF + nifedipine (10 μM)EGFR610.9 ± 1.338.0 ± 2.214.4 ± 2.118.5 ± 1.435.8 ± 3.0ETR210.0 ± 1.0318.8 ± 1.312.48 ± 0.230.89 ± 0.2317.7 ± 1.21 Open table in a new tab In order to determine the role of Ras in the EGF-induced Ca2+ transient, cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the dominant negative Asn17-Ras mutant. Transfection was performed by microinjection, and the transfected cells were identified by co-transfection with a vector encoding a mutated version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP-S65T). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table II, Asn17-Ras inhibits the EGF-induced Ca2+ transient by interfering with both Ca2+ release and Ca2+ influx. Whereas Ca2+ release is strongly but incompletely suppressed (Fig. 1A), Ca2+/Mn2+ influx is completely abrogated (Table II). The results obtained with the dominant negative Ras mutant were confirmed by microinjection of anti-Ras antibodies. The monoclonal antibody Y13-259 had been shown to interact with the effector binding domain of Ras and to inhibit the proliferative effect of serum growth factors (24Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). As shown in Table III, microinjection of this antibody completely inhibits the EGF-induced Ca2+/Mn2+ influx in EGFR6 cells. Microinjection of the non-neutralizing anti-Ras antibody Y13-238 (25Furth M.E. Davis L.J. Fleurdelys B. Scolnick E.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 294-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect Ca2+/Mn2+ influx (Table III). Microinjected unspecific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody which was used to identify the treated cells also did not interfere with the Ca2+ influx (data not shown).TABLE IIEffect of dominant negative Ras (Asn17-Ha-Ras) on Ca2+ influxControlEGF (50 ng/ml)EGF/Asn17-RasThapsigargin (1 μM)Thapsigargin/Asn17-RasEGFR611.9 ± 3.938.0 ± 5.512.8 ± 1.952.9 ± 5.549.6 ± 9.5ETR29.9 ± 2.744.4 ± 3.341.7 ± 5.955.7 ± 3.1151.3 ± 5.3 Open table in a new tab TABLE IIIEffect of anti-Ras antibody on Ca2+ influxControlY13-259 (100 μg/ml)Y13-238 (100 μg/ml)EGF (50 ng/ml)EGF + Y13-259 (100 μg/ml)EGF + Y13-238 (100 μg/ml)Thapsigargin (1 μM)Thapsigargin + Y13-259 (100 μg/ml)EGFR620.8 ± 1.119.0 ± 1.318.9 ± 1.739.2 ± 3.019.8 ± 1.736.9 ± 2.230.6 ± 1.934.3 ± 0.8ETR220.2 ± 1.821.2 ± 2.819.8 ± 2.337.4 ± 2.241.7 ± 2.5NDNDNDET-R.X319.6 ± 0.720.1 ± 2.518.8 ± 1.634.06 ± 2.519.5 ± 2.129.6 ± 4.8NDND Open table in a new tab The absolute Ras dependence of the EGF-induced Ca2+ influx raised the question whether Ras is involved in regulating the activity of store-operated calcium channels. For this reason, intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted with thapsigargin, and the effects of an expression of the dominant negative Ras mutant and microinjected, neutralizing anti-Ras antibody were determined. The data revealed, however, that neither Asn17-Ras nor the neutralizing anti-Ras antibody are able to interfere with thapsigargin-induced store-regulated Ca2+ influx (TABLE II, TABLE III). The role of Ras in the NGFR/Trk-induced Ca2+ signal was studied in ETR2 cells. These cells represent NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing a chimeric EGFR/Trk consisting of the extracellular EGF binding domain of the EGFR and the cytosolic region of Trk (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activation of Trk by EGF results in a calcium signal which resembles the Ca2+ transient observed after activation of EGFR in EGFR6 cells (Fig. 1B and Table I). In contrast to the EGFR-induced Ca2+ signal, neither release nor influx of Ca2+ are affected by an expression of Asn17-Ras or microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies (Fig. 1B, TABLE II, TABLE III). A major difference between EGFR and NGFR/Trk is the affinity to PLCγ1. Compared to the EGFR, the affinity of Trk to PLCγ1 is approximately 100-fold higher (26Obermeier A. Halfter H. Wiesmueller K.H. Jung G. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The high affinity of activated Trk was shown to be defined by ±5 amino acid residues flanking phosphorylated tyrosine 785. Changing the tyrosine at this position to phenylalanine causes a PLCγ binding-incompetent mutant receptor that cannot induce any IP3 or Ca2+ signal upon EGF stimulation (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the EGFR, a PLCγ1 binding site surrounding tyrosine 992 had been identified. In addition to the EGFR domain surrounding Tyr992, which exhibits the highest affinity for PLCγ, secondary low affinity binding sites such as Tyr1068 and Tyr1173 could be characterized (27Rotin D. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Daly R.J. Daum G. Li N. Fischer E.H. Burgess W.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the significance of the distinct binding properties for the Ras dependence of the Ca2+ signal, exchange mutants were employed. The exchange mutant EGF-RX carried the Trk residues 780-790 in place of the EGFR amino acids 987-997; in ET-R, Trk residues 780-790 were replaced by the EGFR sequence 987-997, to yield ET-RX as described previously (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The expression levels and functionality of the mutant receptors were determined in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells as described before (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The ability of the mutant receptors to activate Ras independently of their PLCγ binding domain was ascertained (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, substitution of the PLCγ1 binding site of Trk by the PLCγ binding domain of the EGFR renders the Ca2+ influx into cells overexpressing the mutant Trk receptor (ET-R.X3) sensitive to dominant negative Ras or to microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies (Table III). Inversely, the Ca2+ influx elicited by the activated EGFR which is completely blocked by Asn17-Ras becomes refractory to the expression of the dominant negative Ras mutant if the exchange mutant EGF-R.X2 carrying the PLCγ binding site from Trk is expressed (Fig. 2). Thus, the Ras dependence of the Ca2+ influx induced by the activated EGFR or Trk, respectively, is determined by the structure of the PLCγ binding sites and can be transferred from one receptor to the other together with the corresponding binding domain of the receptors. The data presented here demonstrate that the Ca2+ signal induced by an activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mediated by a Ras-dependent mechanism. The complete inhibition of Ca2+ influx which is seen in cells expressing the dominant negative Asn17-Ras mutant or observed after microinjection of neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies is probably due to the suppression of Ca2+ release (Fig. 1A). The attenuated depletion of internal Ca2+ stores may be insufficient to activate a store-operated Ca2+ influx. That Ras is not required for the activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels of the plasma membrane is supported by the insensitivity of the thapsigargin-mediated Ca2+ influx to Asn17-Ras or microinjected neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies. The mechanism by which Ras regulates Ca2+ release remains to be elucidated. According to a recent publication, the EGF-induced Ca2+ transient is completely abolished by dominant negative Asn17-Rac1 (23Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries Smits A.M. Qiu R.G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. de Laat S.W. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7883-7886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicating that Asn17-Rac1 also interferes with Ca2+ release; otherwise, the initial rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ release would have been unaffected. These findings together with the data reported here suggest that the EGF-induced Ca2+ release involves Ras and Rac1. The activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JUNKs) by EGF has also been shown to require Ras and Rac1 (28Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 29Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Thus, the activated EGFR may employ a similar pathway for the generation of the Ca2+ signal and the activation of JUNK. The release of internal Ca2+ is usually mediated by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generated by a phospholipase C (PLC) (30Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated EGFR is known to bind and activate PLCγ (31Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor T.S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although evidence for Ras as an upstream effector or regulator of PLCγ has been presented (32Smith M.R. Liu Y.L. Kim H. Rhee S.G. Kung H.F. Science. 1990; 247: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Valius M. Secrist J.P. Kazlauskas A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 3058-3071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism by which Ras could regulate PLC activity is still unclear. Recently, it has been shown that the SH2 domains of p120Ras-GAP exhibit a similar affinity to a binding site of the EGFR as the SH2 domains of PLCγ (34Soler C. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12320-12324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region around the phosphorylated tyrosine at position 992 was also described as a high affinity binding site for protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1b (PTP1b) and PLCγ as well as GAP are equally effective in competing with PTP1b for binding to the EGFR (35Milarski K.L. Zhu G. Pearl C.G. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. MacLean D. Thieme-Sefler A. Zhang Z.-Y. Sawyer T. Decker S.J. Dixon J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23634-23639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ras-GAP and PLCγ may compete for the same binding site of the EGF receptor. Since Ras-GAP also binds to the effector domain of GTP-charged Ras (36Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), which requires a release from the receptor (37Serth J. Weber W. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6361-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), conditions which favor the accumulation of Ras-GDP-like expression of Asn17-Ras (38Medema R.H. de Vries Smits A.M. van der Zon G.C. Maassen J.A. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39Grunicke H.H. Maly K. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 389-402PubMed Google Scholar) or blockade of the effector binding domain of Ras by a neutralizing antibody may enhance the association of Ras-GAP to the PLCγ binding site of the EGFR and thereby reduce the activation of PLCγ. This competition may be more relevant for the EGFR than for Trk as (i) the affinity of PLCγ to the binding site around tyrosine 992 of the EGFR is significantly lower than the affinity of PLCγ to Trk where residues flanking tyrosine 785 form a high affinity binding domain for PLCγ (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), (ii) there is so far no evidence for a competition between GAP and PLCγ for a common binding site on Trk. The assumption that the Ras dependence of the Ca2+ influx induced by the activated receptors is correlated to their affinities for PLCγ1 could be confirmed by studies employing receptor mutants. We had shown previously (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the EGF-induced IP3 response in cells overexpressing the EGFR/Trk (ETR) is proportional to the affinities of PLCγ1 to the corresponding receptors, i.e. high for ET-R cells and low for EGF-R cells. Substitution of tyrosine at position 785 of the ETR by a phenylalanine eliminates binding of PLCγ1 to the ETR and abrogates the EGF-induced IP3 and Ca2+ signals (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Exchange of the PLCγ1 binding sites of EGFR and Trk reduces the binding of PLCγ1 to the mutated ETR and enhances PLCγ1 binding to the EGFR exchange mutant. Accordingly, EGF-induced IP3 and Ca2+ signals were found to be strictly proportional to the binding affinities of PLCγ1 to the corresponding receptor mutants (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activation of a mutant EGFR carrying the PLCγ1 binding domain of Trk instead of the endogenous PLCγ binding domain leads to a Ca2+ influx which is unaffected by dominant negative Ras, although the expression levels of the wild type EGFR6 and the mutant EGF-R.X2 were found to be similar. Furthermore, the Trk-induced Ca2+ influx which was found to be unaffected by dominant negative Ras, becomes Ras-dependent if the PLCγ1 binding site of Trk is replaced by the PLC binding domain of the EGFR. The data obtained with the exchange mutants also demonstrate that the insensitivity of the Trk-induced Ca2+ influx to dominant negative Asn17-Ras is not explained by an inefficient blockade of Ras activation. Both the ET-R2 cells and the ET-R.X3 cells overexpress the corresponding chimeric EGF/Trk receptors to similar levels (1Obermeier A. Tinhofer I. Grunicke H.H. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas Asn17-Ras does not affect the Ca2+ influx following activation of the ET-R receptors which contain the wild-type Trk, the Ca2+ signal observed after stimulation of the ET-RX receptor carrying the mutated PLC binding site is completely abrogated, demonstrating that Asn17-Ras is indeed active in the cells expressing the chimeric EGFR/Trk receptors. The implication of Rac1 in the EGF-induced Ca2+ signal which had been reported by others (23Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Vries Smits A.M. Qiu R.G. M'Rabet L. Symons M.H. de Laat S.W. Bos J.L.

Rac1 and RhoA have been shown to stimulate phosphatidylinositol-4′-kinase and phosphatidyl-4-phosphate-5′-kinase, respectively (40Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A.

Dominant negative RhoN19 causes indeed a partial inhibition of the EGF-induced Ca2+ signal under conditions where the ATP-mediated Ca2+ transient is unaffected (23Peppelenbosch M.P.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which Ras activates Rac1 is still unclear, evidence is accumulating that Rac1 can be activated by Ras-dependent and independent pathways (29Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Evidence for an activation of RhoA by Rac1 has been presented (42Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3076) Google Scholar). Phospholipase A2 has also been implicated in the generation of the EGF-induced Ca2+ signal (43Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Depending on the cell type, activation of PLA2 appears to be mediated by either Ras or Rac1, but the role of this PLA2-dependent pathway for the EGF-induced Ca2+ signal is still obscure (43Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries Smits A.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H. Bos J.L. Cell. 1995; 81: 849-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In summary, activation of the EGFR results in an elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ which is inhibitable by expression of dominant negative Ras or microinjection of neutralizing anti-Ras antibodies. We conclude that the EGF-induced Ca2+ transient represents a Ras-regulated mechanism and that the rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ elicited by a stimulation of the NGFR is independent of Ras. We suggest, as a hypothetical model, that the Ras dependence of the EGF-induced Ca2+ signal mediated by the EGFR is due to a competition of PLCγ and p120Ras-GAP for a common binding site of the EGFR, and that the differences between the EGFR and Trk reflect the differences in the affinity of PLCγ to the EGFR or Trk, respectively.

The insolubilized synthetic peptide representing the phosphorylated form of the tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of FcγRIIb also binds Shc from the lysates of activated but not from resting BL41 cells. This suggests that the binding does not depend on the interaction of FcγRIIb1-phosphotyrosine with the SH2 domain of Shc. Tyr phosphorylation of FcγRIIb1-associated Shc is low, indicating an impaired function. Shc is implicated in regulating p21ras activation; thus, we have compared p21ras activities in BL41 cells treated in different ways. p21ras activity is reduced when B cell receptor and FcγRIIb1 are co-ligated. p21ras couples protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent events to the Ser/Thr kinase-mediated signaling pathway leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Our results show that B cell receptor-FcγRIIb1 co-cross-linking partially inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.

There is evidence to suggest that both the N- and C-terminal regions of IGFBPs are important for complex formation with IGFs (21Wang J.-F. Hampton B. Mehlman T. Burgess W.H. Rechler M.M. Biochem.

In contrast, the respective middle regions of IGFBP sequences show greater heterogeneity. We have used chemical iodination to characterize the binding interaction between IGFs and bIGFBP-2. We have achieved this by identifying tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 which are iodinated when this molecule is not bound to IGFs, but on the other hand are protected from iodination when either IGF-I or IGF-II is bound. The primary structure of bIGFBP-2 contains six tyrosine residues which are spread throughout the amino acid sequence of this molecule. This study has shown that an approximate 5-fold protection against modification specifically at Tyr60 occurs when bIGFBP-2 is iodinated while in a complex with either IGF-I or IGF-II. Finally, iodination at Tyr60 leads to a significant reduction in the affinity of IGFs for bIGFBP-2, indicating that Tyr60 may be one of a number of residues which play an important role in the bIGFBP-2 binding reaction with the IGFs. Recombinant bIGFBP-2 was transiently expressed in the COS-1 (ATCC: CRL 1650) monkey kidney cell line and purified from medium conditioned by the transfected cells by a method adapted from Szabo et al.

HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Merck (Kilsyth, Victoria, Australia) and trifluoroacetic acid from Sigma-Aldridge (Castle Hill, N.S.W., Australia). All other reagents were analytical grade. At the scale of 0.1 nmol of bIGFBP-2, a series of iodinations were performed by the chloramine-T method (9Moss J.A. Francis G.L. Ross M. Wallace J.C.

The amount of Na125I (specific radioactivity 50 nCi/nmol) was maintained at 4 nmol/reaction and the molar ratio of chloramine-T/Na125I per reaction was varied between 0.125 and 1.25. Two stock solutions were prepared, one containing bIGFBP-2 and the other containing both bIGFBP-2 and IGF-II in the following manner. In two separate tubes, 0.8 nmol of lyophilized bIGFBP-2 was resuspended in 350 μl of iodination buffer (250 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). Forty microliters of 10 mM acetic acid was added to the bIGFBP-2 stock solution and 3.2 nmol of IGF-II in 40 μl of 10 mM acetic acid was added to the bIGFBP-2/IGF-II stock solution (resulting in a 4-fold molar ratio of IGF-II to bIGFBP-2). The vials were left at room temperature for 120 min to allow the complex between bIGFBP-2 and IGF-II to form. Then 36 nmol of NaI was added to each reaction mixture in 10 μl of 5 mM NaOH. This was the equivalent of a 40-fold molar excess of NaI over bIGFBP-2. After mixing, both of the reaction mixtures were divided into 8 × 50-μl (0.1 nmol) aliquots of bIGFBP-2. Iodination was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the appropriate chloramine-T solution (prepared in a 10-fold serial dilution in 8 steps from 0.5 to 0.05 mM with water) followed by an incubation at room temperature for 45 s. Each reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 nmol of sodium metabisulfite in 10 μl of water. The 16 reaction mixtures were stored at −20°C prior to HPLC gel filtration at acid pH. Reaction products were thawed and acidified by the addition of 50 μl of 2 M acetic acid to dissociate the IGF·bIGFBP-2 complex. Iodinated bIGFBP-2 was separated from free iodide and iodinated IGF (when present) by gel filtration on a TSK G3000SW Ultrogel HPLC column (7.5 × 600 mm) equilibrated with a solution containing 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM HCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and 1-ml fractions were collected for γ-counting. Protein was detected by absorbance at 215 nm and tyrosine fluorescence (excitation 275 nm, emission 305 nm). The amount of bIGFBP-2 recovered from the column was estimated by the integrated area of the 215-nm absorbance peak using the extinction coefficient ϵ0 = 6.5 × 106μvolt·s·mg−1 (25Buck M.A. Olah T.A. Weitzmann C.J. Cooperman B.S. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and standardized with accurately quantified IGF-II standards (GroPep Pty. Ltd.). The amount of iodine incorporated was estimated by the radioactivity associated with the bIGFBP-2 peak, adjusting for the known 125I specific activity. The elution times of bIGFBP-2, IGF-II, and radioactive iodide were established by independent injection of the respective components. bIGFBP-2 (3.9 nmol) was dissolved in 255 μl of iodination buffer and divided into three equal 1.3-nmol aliquots. Either IGF-I or IGF-II (5 nmol in 40 μl of 10 mM acetic acid) was added to one aliquot, while 40 μl of 10 mM acetic acid was added to the other two bIGFBP-2 solutions. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 120 min to allow the complex between IGF and bIGFBP-2 to form. Then 52 nmol of NaI (specific radioactivity 2 nCi/nmol) was added to each of the three bIGFBP-2 solutions. Sodium metabisulfite, 200 nmol in 10 μl of water, was added to one of the bIGFBP-2 solutions to prevent iodination in this tube. Following the addition of 40 nmol of chloramine-T in 10 μl of water (corresponding to a chloramine-T/NaI molar ratio of 0.75) to each tube, the iodination reactions proceeded as described above. The iodinations of bIGFBP-2 alone and bIGFBP-2 in complex with IGF-I or IGF-II were then stopped by the addition of 200 nmol of sodium metabisulfite in 10 μl of water. All of the reaction mixtures were acidified by the addition of 100 μl of 4 M acetic acid and the bIGFBP-2 species were then purified by HPLC gel filtration as described above and the bIGFBP-2 peaks were lyophilized (Speed-Vac, Savant, Farmingdale, NY). Iodinated bIGFBP-2 species were subjected to tryptic peptide mapping as follows. Each of the lyophilized bIGFBP-2 species was denatured and reduced in 1 ml of S-carboxymethylation buffer (8 M urea, 0.6 M guanidine HCl, 20 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) and the cysteine thiols were blocked by reaction with 69 μmol of iodoacetic acid in 200 μl of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The reaction was allowed to proceed in the dark at room temperature for 15 min and subsequently, the S-carboxymethylated bIGFBP-2 species was purified on a C4 reverse-phase HPLC cartridge (Brownlee Aquapore BU300 C4, 7 μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, and dimensions of 2.1 × 100 mm). The protein was eluted over a linear gradient of 10-50% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 20 min, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The bIGFBP-2 peak was collected and concentrated to approximately 20 μl by solvent evaporation under vacuum (Speed-Vac, Savant), then diluted to 1 ml with digestion buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 20 mM CaCl2). Digestion was initiated by the addition of 2 μg of trypsin in 2 μl of 10 mM acetic acid and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 12 h after which a further 2 μg of trypsin was added and the digestion continued for an additional 12 h. This corresponded to a final enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) and a total reaction time of 24 h. Due to the relatively high enzyme to substrate ratio and extended reaction times, the self-digestion products of trypsin were also determined in a control incubation of trypsin in digestion buffer alone, under the same conditions. The digestions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. The digested bIGFBP-2 peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (using the same cartridge as described above) at 40°C with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 50% (v/v) in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid over 50 min at 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the peptide backbone bonds was monitored at 215 nm, aromatic residues at 275 nm and tryptophan at 295 nm. Non-iodinated tyrosyl peptides were detected by their specific tyrosine fluorescence (excitation 275 nm, emission 305 nm) while iodinated tyrosyl peptides were detected at 295 nm and by detection of γ-radiation as tyrosine iodination abolished tyrosine fluorescence (26Cowgill R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 94: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Eluate was collected in 0.25 min fractions starting with the first fluorescent peak. Peptides which contained tyrosyl peptides were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Edman degradation was carried out automatically on an Applied Biosystems model 470A gas-phase Sequencer with a 900A Control/Data Analysis Module. Mono-iodotyrosine and di-iodotyrosine were identified in the sequencer chromatograms (27Tsomides T.J. Eisen H.N. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and were confirmed by their radioactivity. The separate tryptic peptides which encompass the six tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 (Tyr60, Tyr71, Tyr98, Tyr213, Tyr226, and Tyr269) will be referred to subsequently as the peptides P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and P6, respectively, and the iodinated derivatives will be referred to as Px* (mono-iodotyrosyl derivative) and Px** (di-iodotyrosyl derivative), where (x) refers to the peptides 1-6. The positions of P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 and the iodinated derivatives of these peptides in the elution profile of the tryptic map were established by N-terminal sequencing. The identities of tyrosine containing peptides were confirmed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (EMS) on a Perkin Elmer Psi-ex triple quadrupole mass spectrometer by Yoji Hawasaka at the Australian Research Council EMS unit, Adelaide. bIGFBP-2 was modified as described in the large-scale iodinations except that the radioactive iodine isotope 125I was omitted from the reaction. Again, bIGFBP-2 was iodinated alone and in a complex with both IGF-I and IGF-II. The iodinated bIGFBP-2 species were then purified by HPLC gel filtration as described above and the incorporation of iodine was confirmed by the loss of tyrosine-specific fluorescence during the chromatography. The relative affinities of the respective iodinated bIGFBP-2 species for both 125I-labeled IGF-I and IGF-II were determined by charcoal binding assay, as described previously (24Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have used IGF-mediated protection against chemical modification of the tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 to investigate the association between bIGFBP-2 and IGF-I or IGF-II at the molecular level. The 6 tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 are distributed throughout the amino acid sequence and so enable the IGF-binding site to be localized to the N-terminal, middle, or C-terminal regions of this molecule. In this study, we have identified tyrosine residues which are protected from chloramine T-mediated iodination when IGFs are bound as outlined in Fig. 1. When the concentration of NaI was held at 40-fold excess over bIGFBP-2, an increase in the molar ratio of chloramine-T/NaI in the iodination reaction resulted in an increase in the amount of iodine which became incorporated into bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 2a). This figure also shows that when bIGFBP-2 was iodinated in a complex with IGF-II, the molar incorporation of iodine into bIGFBP-2 was reduced. A linear increase in iodine incorporation was observed for both IGF-protected bIGFBP-2 and unprotected bIGFBP-2 over the chloramine-T/NaI molar ratio range of 0.125 and 0.75. However, when this ratio was increased beyond 0.75, the subsequent increase in iodine incorporation into both protected and free bIGFBP-2 was less, on a molar basis. For IGF-protected bIGFBP-2 this change in the reactivity of the bIGFBP-2 tyrosine residue population was observed to occur when approximately 5 mol of iodine had been incorporated per bIGFBP-2 molecule compared with approximately 8 mol of iodine for bIGFBP-2 alone. These results suggest that the number of reactive tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 was reduced when IGF-II was bound. The tyrosine fluorescence of the intact bIGFBP-2 molecule was a useful measure of the degree of iodination of the tyrosine residues. The chloramine T-dependent increase in the iodination of bIGFBP-2 was seen by a corresponding drop in tyrosine-specific fluorescence (Fig. 2b). As the ratio of chloramine-T/NaI per reaction was increased between 0.125 and 0.5, there was a rapid loss of bIGFBP-2 associated tyrosine fluorescence. However, negligible further losses in the tyrosine fluorescence of the iodinated bIGFBP-2 species were observed when this ratio was increased beyond 0.5. Fig. 2b shows that the tyrosine fluorescence ultimately dropped to approximately 10% of the unmodified molecule when bIGFBP-2 was iodinated alone. In contrast, bIGFBP-2 which had been iodinated while protected by IGF-II still retained 40% of the tyrosine fluorescence of the unmodified molecule. Both sets of data outlined above, which are representative examples of four independent experiments, suggest that ordinarily reactive tyrosine residues of bIGFBP-2 were protected from iodination when IGF-II was bound. A 0.75 molar ratio of chloramine-T/NaI was chosen to generate iodinated bIGFBP-2 at a scale which enabled the modification pattern of iodinated IGF-associated and free bIGFBP-2 to be determined by tryptic mapping. These reaction conditions are indicated by arrows in Figs. 2, a and b. Complete tryptic digestion of bIGFBP-2 would theoretically generate 32 fragments ranging in size from single amino acids up to a peptide of 45 residues (Fig. 3). Trypsin was chosen as the proteolytic mapping enzyme because in theory it could liberate each tyrosine residue in a discrete peptide fragment. Following tryptic digestion, peptides of bIGFBP-2 were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 4). Autodigestion of trypsin (Fig. 4d) generated a background of 7 fluorescent peaks. Digestion of non-iodinated bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 4a) resulted in the generation of 9 tyrosine containing peptides in addition to those generated by trypsin autodigestion as detected by tyrosine fluorescence. The pattern of digestion shown in Fig. 4 is representative of the many experiments performed (data not shown). N-terminal sequence analysis and EMS identified the fluorescent tryptic peptides of bIGFBP-2 to be (in order of elution) P1, P6, P2, and P3, +P6, P4+P5+, P4+P5, +P4+P5, where + indicates an intact trypsin-sensitive bond, as defined in Fig. 3. The tyrosyl peptides P4, P5, and P6 were all identified as partial digestion fragments while the peptides P2 and P3 were not resolved by this chromatography. The mass of the peptide which was identified as P3 by N-terminal sequencing was between 15 and 16 mass units greater than the predicted mass. One possible explanation for this observation is the previously documented (28Baker M.S. Green S.P. Goss N. Katrantzis M. Doe W.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Mistry R. Snashall P.D. Totty N. Guz A. Tetley T.D. Biochem.

Open table in a new tab The loss of tyrosine fluorescence due to iodination can clearly be seen when the tryptic map of non-iodinated bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 4a) is compared with the tryptic tyrosine fluorescence maps of bIGFBP-2 iodinated ether alone (Fig. 4b) or complexed with IGF-II (Fig. 4c). Table Ib summarizes the differences in residual tyrosine fluorescence of bIGFBP-2 which was iodinated in a complex with IGF-II or alone. An additional fluorescent peak (A) was present in the iodinated bIGFBP-2 maps but was absent in the non-iodinated bIGFBP-2 map. However, this peak was most probably an artifact of the iodination reaction as both N-terminal sequence and EMS analysis showed conclusively that this peak was not a peptide. The order of tyrosine reactivity when calculated in terms of the residual tyrosine fluorescence (Table Ib) changed from P6 > P1 > P2 and P3 > P4+P5 when bIGFBP-2 was modified alone to P2 and P3 > P6 > P4+P5 > P1 when bIGFBP-2 was modified in a complex with IGF-II. However, the major difference in the iodination pattern of both free bIGFBP-2 and IGF-II associated bIGFBP-2 was the large residual tyrosine fluorescence of the peptide P1 in the map of IGF-II associated bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 4c). When quantified, the residual fluorescence of this peptide was 94% of the tyrosine specific fluorescence yielded by the same peptide isolated from non-iodinated bIGFBP-2 (Fig. 4a) and was 5.7-fold more intense than for the same peptide from bIGFBP-2 which had been iodinated free of IGF-II (Fig. 4b). The amount of non-iodinated P6 peptide was very low in all of the iodinated bIGFBP-2 tryptic maps which indicated that this residue was freely available for iodination, although complex formation with IGF-II afforded a 2.5-fold protection against modification at this site (Fig. 4c) in comparison to bIGFBP-2 modified alone (Fig. 4b). The non-iodinated tyrosyl peptides P2 and P3 were 2.8 times more abundant in the peptide map of bIGFBP-2 which had been modified alone (Fig. 4b) compared with bIGFBP-2 which was iodinated with IGF-II bound (Fig. 4c). The additive residual tyrosine specific fluorescence of partially digested peptides which contained P4 and P5 were similar (Fig. 4, b and c) regardless of IGF association prior to the iodination reaction. The tyrosine fluorescence associated with P4+P5 peptides was significant, accounting for 36% of the total remaining fluorescence of the non-iodinated tyrosyl peptides. The tryptic peptides of bIGFBP-2 which had incorporated iodine were also directly identified by their 125I radioactivity. Fig. 5 shows an alignment of the tryptic map fractions of bIGFBP-2 iodinated free (a) and bIGFBP-2 iodinated as a complex with IGF-II (b) which contain 125I radioactivity. Fractions which contained iodinated peptides were characterized by both N-terminal sequencing and EMS as summarized in Table IIa. Tyrosine containing peptides were the only peptides of bIGFBP-2 which were found to incorporate iodine under our reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 5a, the order of elution of iodinated tyrosyl peptides of bIGFBP-2 was determined to be P1*, P1**, P6*, P6**, and P3*; and P3**, P2*, P2**, +P6**, (+P4+P5)**; and (P4+P5)*, (P4+P5)**, and (P4+P5)***, where parentheses indicate that the locations of the iodine atoms in these peptides were not characterized. The incorporation of iodine was observed to increase the hydrophobicity of tyrosine containing peptides as can be seen"

Monoclonal antibodies against Nα-phosphopyridoxyl-L-lysine were screened for: 1) binding of 5′-phosphopyridoxyl amino acids, 2) binding of Schiff base of pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) and amino acids, the first intermediate of all PLP-dependent reactions, and 3) catalysis of PLP-dependent α,β-elimination with β-chloro-D/L-alanine.

INTRODUCTIONThe cytokine receptor superfamily is a large group of structurally related proteins that together with their ligands, the hematopoietic cytokines, regulate important cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. Characteristic three-dimensional folds have been identified for both receptor and ligand families. The ligands have been characterized as four antiparallel α helix bundle proteins (for review, see 1Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the receptors a common two domain immunoglobulin-like fold was suggested, based on the low but significant homology seen in the extracellular ligand binding domain of these proteins (2Bazan J.F.

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar).It is generally accepted that common structural principles underlie hematopoietic cytokine receptor recognition and signaling. As shown for growth hormone, binding and signal transduction involve formation of a receptor subunit dimer that is dependent on binding of the ligand first to the primary receptor subunit, followed by binding of this complex to the second receptor subunit (5Cunningham B.C.

Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Juxtaposition of the two cytoplasmic receptor domains is thought to initiate the signaling cascade and typically involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including the receptor subunits themselves, by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (7Ihle J.N.

The primary subunit GM-Rα binds GM-CSF with low affinity, whereas GM-Rβ on its own has no detectable binding affinity for GM-CSF. In combination with GM-Rα, GM-Rβ confers high affinity binding and forms a heterodimeric receptor complex, a critical step in signal transduction induced by GM-CSF. However, several aspects remain unresolved, including the precise stoichiometry of the signaling complex and the contributions of each subunit to signaling.

We replaced the extracellular domains of the GM-CSF receptor α and β subunits with a coiled coil motif or “leucine zipper” and examined these constructs for their capacity to confer factor-independent growth when transfected into the pro-B cell line Ba/F3. To form a coiled coil, we used the leucine zipper regions of the transcription factors Jun and Fos. When both leucine zipper domains are present, heterodimers of the two leucine zippers predominate, since this is the most energetically favorable combination (22O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford III, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, the Jun leucine zipper domain can form homodimers, although they are less favorable than heterodimers, and Fos homodimers are the least likely to occur (22O'Shea E.K. Rutkowski R. Stafford III, W.F. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 245: 646-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In previous studies, the Fos-Jun leucine zipper has been used to mediate the formation of bispecific antibodies (23Kostelny S.A. Cole M.S. Tso J.Y. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1547-1553PubMed Google Scholar), as well as to initiate aspartate receptor-mediated chemotaxis in Escherichia coli (24Cochran A.G. Kim P.S. Science. 1996; 271: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the use of the Fos-Jun leucine zipper to analyze the mechanism of signal transduction through the GM-CSF receptor and to test the potential of the IFNγRβ to signal as a homodimer. We find that the leucine zipper can functionally substitute for the combination of ligand and GM-Rα and GM-Rβ extracellular domains. Our findings bear on the question of GM-CSF signaling complex stoichiometry, since we find that simple heterodimers of GM-Rα and GM-Rβ are able to signal. We also observe signaling by homodimers of the GM-Rα cytoplasmic domain. In addition, we have created homodimers of the β subunit of the hIFNγ receptor, a class II cytokine receptor subunit with a short cytoplasmic domain, via a Jun extracellular zipper domain to explore the potential of the β subunit to signal. We demonstrate that a hIFNγRβ homodimer can transduce a proliferative response in Ba/F3 cells.DISCUSSIONWe have investigated the requirement of GM-CSF receptor extracellular domains for one aspect of signaling, proliferation, by replacing the extracellular domain with the leucine zipper domain of either the Fos or Jun protein. Simultaneous expression of Fos-α and Jun-βc resulted in a proliferative response and conferred factor independence on Ba/F3 cells, suggesting that the extracellular domains contribute to signaling only by causing ligand-dependent association of the receptor intracellular domains. Since neither Fos nor Jun has structural similarities to receptor extracellular domains, yet they functionally substitute for the combination of ligand and GM-Rα and GM-Rβ extracellular domains, we conclude that specific extracellular domain structure is not crucial as long as specific dimer formation is ensured. Our observations suggest that specific ligand-induced allosteric changes in the receptor extracellular domains are unlikely to be required for initiation of signal transduction. Furthermore, the GM-CSF receptor extracellular domains do not depend on interactions with auxiliary proteins to initiate the signaling cascade that results in proliferation, since our simple Fos-Rα and Jun-βc heterodimers signal but exclude the possibility of interactions with additional extracellular domains.We selected a leucine zipper to drive receptor dimerization based on the observation that in ligand-induced signaling by single transmembrane receptors, close parallel alignment of the α helical transmembrane segment of each of the two interacting subunits appears to be crucial (30Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). Activating transmembrane domain mutations have been described for two single transmembrane receptors, the neu oncogene (31Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) and the common β subunit of the GM-CSF receptor (13Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Both mutations act by inducing constitutive receptor dimerization (13Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 587Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 33Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Structural evidence indicates that the basis for constitutive homodimerization in the mutant neu receptor is the formation of an energetically favorable coiled coil by two parallel transmembrane domains (34Brandt R.P. Pincus M.R. Chen J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1989; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Replacement of both GM-CSF receptor extracellular domains with α helices capable of forming a coiled coil heterodimer most likely allows for optimal positioning of the two parallel transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to initiate the signal transduction process.Our findings have implications for the question of signaling complex stoichiometry. The number of each receptor subunit present in the native GM-CSF receptor signaling complex remains unknown, although several groups have suggested that it may comprise oligomers of αβ dimers, which allow multimers of β subunits to come in contact with each other (14Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the leucine zippers Fos and Jun interact as a simple heterodimer in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore in the Fos-α/Jun-βc transfectant line, the stoichiometry of intracellular domains in the signaling complex is one α and one β subunit. Although multiple receptor subunits may be present in the native complex, our results indicate that dimers consisting of one α and one β subunit are sufficient to initiate signaling for proliferation. We cannot rule out the possibility that αβ dimers may recruit additional β subunits or αβ dimers into the complex. If additional components do enter the complex, then in our reconstituted system (and possibly in the native complex) they must do so by interactions mediated by either the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains, since our system excludes additional extracellular interactions.Several studies with chimeric receptors have shown that dimerization of the intracellular portion of the GM-Rβ subunit is sufficient to initiate proliferation (14Eder M. Ernst T.J. Ganser A. Jubinsky P.T. Inhorn R. Hoelzer D. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30173-30180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, our transfectant lines expressing either Jun-βc or Cys/Jun-βc show a biological response. From our observed increase in the short term survival of the Jun-Rβ transfectants over untransfected cells, we infer that the Jun-β construct promotes the dimerization of the β intracellular domain, albeit transiently and perhaps infrequently. Long term survival and proliferation probably require the formation of a greater number of intracellular dimers, longer lasting association, or both. These requirements are clearly met by the presence of a single additional extracellular cysteine residue. In Cys/Jun-βc transfectants, the paired β intracellular domains are able to signal for long term proliferation, a response not observed with the equivalent construct lacking the additional cysteine.More surprising are our findings regarding the biological effects of stable GM-Rα dimers formed by the Cys/Jun-α construct. The role of the intracellular domain of the GM-Rα subunit in proliferation is not well understood. Several studies point to its requirement for GM-CSF-induced initiation of proliferation (35Weiss M. Yokoyama C. Shikama Y. Naugle C. Druker B. Sieff C.A. Blood. 1993; 82: 3298-3306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in at least one study, dimers of the α cytoplasmic domain (via hybrid GM-CSF receptors) did not result in a signal for proliferation (15Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On detailed examination of our Cys/Jun-α transfectants, however, we found no net change in the live cell numbers during the first 14 days following mIL-3 deprivation. Since the line remains viable in the absence of growth factor, we propose that dimers of the GM-Rα cytoplasmic domain are signaling either to prevent apoptosis or to initiate cell proliferation at a rate equal to the rate of cell death. After approximately 2 weeks in the absence of mIL-3, the Cys/Jun-α cultures were able to proliferate at a rate that exceeded the rate of cell death, and these cultures were maintained for more than 6 months.The growth characteristics of our Cys/Jun-α line closely resemble the phenotype observed with a mouse GM-Rβ variant that lacks an extracellular domain, except for a small novel sequence of 34 amino acids, which includes a single cysteine residue (37Hannemann J. Hara T. Kawai M. Miyajima A. Ostertag W. Stocking C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2402-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When transfected into Ba/F3 cells this variant of the β chain does not immediately confer factor-independent proliferation but, rather, promotes the transformation of cells to factor independence after >14 days. A possible explanation for the delayed proliferative response is that during the 2-week period, cells with mutations that allow a more robust proliferative response have been selected. However, formation of either αα dimers (as described here) or ββ dimers (37Hannemann J. Hara T. Kawai M. Miyajima A. Ostertag W. Stocking C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2402-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is still required to obtain the proliferative response. A similar attempt to induce factor independence in Ba/F3 cells using a mutant α subunit with a stop codon after the transmembrane domain and an intact β subunit did not give rise to factor independence, even after prolonged (>1 month) culturing in GM-CSF (36Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M.B. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case GM-CSF drives the dimerization of an αβ receptor complex, but this complex only contains one cytoplasmic β domain and no α domain. Taken together these results suggest that forced dimerization of any two GM-CSF receptor subunits (αα, αβ, or ββ) can result in initiation of signaling, presumably by activation of cytoplasmic proteins associated with the cytoplasmic domains of the GM-CSF receptor subunits (for example GM-Rβ with JAK2). If these molecules come in close physical proximity for extended periods, as would be the case in our Cys/Jun-α transfectants, they can become activated and can initiate signaling.We have demonstrated the general utility of using Fos and Jun domains to replace extracellular receptor domains to test productive receptor combinations in the absence of ligand. The FLAG tag allows easy detection, and the small extracellular domain is easy to manipulate as DNA and protein. Specifically we have shown that the extracellular domains of the mouse GM-CSF receptor subunits are functionally dispensable if dimers can be formed by other means, and that dimers consisting of only one α and one β receptor subunit can signal in a manner similar to the wild type receptor. Dimers of the α subunit also initiate signaling, either for prevention of apoptosis or for a low level of proliferation. Finally, we have demonstrated that the formation of hIFNγRβ cytoplasmic domain dimers is sufficient to induce a proliferative signal. With our Jun-hIFNγRβ line, we have defined a system in which one can use intact minimal cytoplasmic domains to further investigate the requirements for signaling that results in proliferation. INTRODUCTIONThe cytokine receptor superfamily is a large group of structurally related proteins that together with their ligands, the hematopoietic cytokines, regulate important cellular processes such as differentiation and proliferation. Characteristic three-dimensional folds have been identified for both receptor and ligand families. The ligands have been characterized as four antiparallel α helix bundle proteins (for review, see 1Rozwarski D.A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bazan J.F. Bohm A. Wlodawer A. Hatada M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 159-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For the receptors a common two domain immunoglobulin-like fold was suggested, based on the low but significant homology seen in the extracellular ligand binding domain of these proteins (2Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar).

Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar).It is generally accepted that common structural principles underlie hematopoietic cytokine receptor recognition and signaling. As shown for growth hormone, binding and signal transduction involve formation of a receptor subunit dimer that is dependent on binding of the ligand first to the primary receptor subunit, followed by binding of this complex to the second receptor subunit (5Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. deVos A. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 6Wells J.A. deVos A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Juxtaposition of the two cytoplasmic receptor domains is thought to initiate the signaling cascade and typically involves tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including the receptor subunits themselves, by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (7Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 8Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Silvennoinen O. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 369-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar).Signaling induced by GM-CSF follows this paradigm and is mediated by a complex comprising the ligand and two receptor subunits, GM-Rα and GM-Rβ, which are members of the cytokine receptor superfamily (9Goodall G.J. Bagley C.J. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A.

The primary subunit GM-Rα binds GM-CSF with low affinity, whereas GM-Rβ on its own has no detectable binding affinity for GM-CSF. In combination with GM-Rα, GM-Rβ confers high affinity binding and forms a heterodimeric receptor complex, a critical step in signal transduction induced by GM-CSF. However, several aspects remain unresolved, including the precise stoichiometry of the signaling complex and the contributions of each subunit to signaling. Several groups have suggested that the native GM-CSF receptor signaling complex may be comprised of oligomers of αβ dimers or β subunit multimers and may involve other as yet unidentified molecules (13Jenkins B.J.

Thus, I-ovalbumin differs from active serpins by its inability to form irreversible complexes with proteinases. I-ovalbumin is unusually thermostable: it does not undergo any structural transition between 45°C and 120°C as tested by differential scanning calorimetry, and it retains full inhibitory capacity after heating at 120°C. It has 8% less α-helices and 9% more β-sheet structures than native ovalbumin, as shown by circular dichroism. Our results show that the primary sequence of ovalbumin contains the information required for enabling the first step of the serpin-proteinase interaction to occur, i.e. the formation of the Michaelis-like reversible complex, but does not contain the information needed for stabilizing this initial complex.

This sequence forms a sharply bent loop (loop 4) connecting β-strand 3 and α-helix 2 of H-Ras (20Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A.

GTP binding induces a conformational change primarily in two regions of H-Ras termed the switch I (residues 30-38, effector domain) domain and the switch II (residue 60-76) domain (22Milburn M.V.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The conformational change in the switch II domain clearly requires Gly-60 because significant structural alterations, such as the reorientation of the Gly-60 amide group and a partial collapse of helix 2, are found to be at or near this residue (20Pai E.F.

In addition, the G60A mutation completely eliminates the biological activity of H-Ras without significantly affecting its binding to guanine nucleotides (31Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.M. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It also drastically reduces RasGAP and NF1-induced GTPase activity of H-Ras but not the binding of H-Ras to them (32Chen Hwang M.-C. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8196-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 was moderately attenuated by the G60A mutation (31Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.M. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, the binding of H-Ras to another downstream target, RalGDS (13Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8196-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the switch II domain may participate, with varying degrees, in the interaction of H-Ras with downstream targets. In this study, we present evidence to show that H-Ras harboring the G60A mutation is a dominant negative mutant that inhibits the function of H-Ras by sequestering H-Ras downstream targets.DISCUSSIONWe have described a new H-Ras dominant negative mutant, v-H-Ras(G60A), that inhibits the activity of v-H-Ras in an oocyte GVBD induction assay. v-H-Ras(G60A) was found to specifically inhibit v-H-Ras but not other mitogenic agents, such as insulin and IGF. The mechanism of inhibition is unlikely to be due to perturbation of guanine-nucleotide exchange factor because v-H-Ras(G60A) was equally effective against either v-H-Ras·GDP or v-H-Ras·GTP. We then searched for v-H-Ras inhibition site among H-Ras downstream targets using a competition assay. Both the N-terminal 275 residues Raf-1 and the C-terminal 127 residues RalGDS were found to suppress the dominant negative effect of v-H-Ras(G60A). These findings indicate that v-H-Ras(G60A) inhibits H-Ras downstream target(s). Unfortunately, H-Ras interacts with multiple downstream targets, and more than one target (Raf-1 and RalGDS) suppressed v-H-Ras(G60A); therefore, the true downstream target(s) of H-Ras could not be determined solely by the competition assay. Nevertheless, by combining the findings of GVBD and kinase assays, it is clear that Raf-1 is an inhibited target. This conclusion is in accord with numerous other studies (51Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 19: 236-240Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 52Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). However, since our current results cannot rule out the possibility that v-H-Ras(G60A) may also inhibit other cellular factors involved in the H-Ras signaling pathways (19Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Frutos S. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31706-31710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether Raf-1 kinase inhibition alone can fully explain the dominant negative phenotype of v-H-Ras(G60A).The straightforward interpretation for the Raf-1 kinase inhibition is that v-H-Ras(G60A) forms a stable but nonproductive complex with Raf-1; this eventually depletes the intracellular Raf-1 pool and blocks the activity of v-H-Ras. However, this interpretation is in direct contrast to the hypothesis that Raf-1 membrane recruitment is the sole contribution of H-Ras to Raf-1 activation (54Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 55Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). If the hypothesis were true, v-H-Ras(G60A) should be able to induce Raf-1 kinase and in turn activate subsequent mitogenic responses because it binds well to Raf-1. Apparently, membrane recruitment is a necessary but not a sufficient step for Raf-1 activation. Membrane recruitment of Raf-1 by H-Ras is mediated by the interaction between the effector domain (switch I) of H-Ras and Raf-1 residues 55-132 termed RBD (8Van Aslet L. Barr M. Marcus S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the switch I domain is not perturbed by the G60A mutation, the binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 RBD is basically intact in the G60A mutant (31Sung Y.J. Carter M. Zhong J.M. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3470-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Chen Hwang M.-C. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 233-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recently, another Raf-1 RBD consisting of residues 130-196, which is capable of independently binding Ras·GTP, was identified (49Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K. Ghosh S. Terrell R.S. Campbell-Burk S. Bell R.M. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9809-9812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to Raf-1 fragments containing the first RBD, the binding of the Raf-1 second RBD is severely impaired by the G60A mutation (58Drugan J.K. Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Der C.J. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. Campbell S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 233-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These findings support the hypothesis that Ras induces Raf-1 through a multiple step reaction, which may involve an initial interaction between the first RBD with the switch I domain that recruits Raf-1 to membrane and a second interaction between the second RBD and the switch II domain that initiates Raf-1 activation. It appears that the G60A mutant sequesters Raf-1 by uncoupling these interaction events. v-H-Ras(G60A) cannot display its dominant negative phenotype without proper membrane attachment (Table III). This result not only indicates that membrane localization is important for sequestering Raf-1, it also implies that the second interaction between Ras and Raf-1 may not occur until Raf-1 is membrane bound. However, it is not known whether membrane attachment per se is sufficient or if additional factors are required to form stable v-H-Ras(G60A)·Raf-1 complexes.In addition to forming inactive v-H-Ras(G60A)·Raf-1 complexes, it is clear that the competitive binding of v-H-Ras and v-H-Ras(G60A) to their downstream effectors also contributes to the dominant negative effect of v-H-Ras(G60A). This is why the extent of v-H-Ras(G60A) dominant negative effect is critically dependent upon the molar ratio of v-H-Ras(G60A) to v-H-Ras (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The GTPase activity of c-H-Ras was drastically reduced by the G60A mutation; however, unlike v-H-Ras(G60A), c-H-Ras(G60A) still contained detectable GTPase activity (32Chen Hwang M.-C. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8196-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, c-H-Ras(G60A)·GTP must have a shorter half-life than v-H-Ras(G60A)·GTP. GTP hydrolysis promotes the dissociation of the sequestered downstream target from the sequestered complex; this may be why c-H-Ras(G60A) exhibits a weaker dominant negative phenotype than v-H-Ras(G60A).Apparently, the ability to form a stable complex with v-H-Ras(G60A) is not a universal property of all H-Ras downstream targets. This phenomenon may simply reflect the difference in binding strength. Raf-1 and RalGDS are known to bind much more tightly to H-Ras than RasGAP (13Kikuchi A. Demo S.D. Ye Z.H. Chen Y.W. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 7483-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 59Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol.

We have not tested other H-Ras downstream targets, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MEKK, PKCζ, and Rin (15Han L. Colicelli J. Mol.

Assuming 500 nl for the volume of an oocyte, Ras at 46 ng, GST-Raf-1-N275 at 4.6 ng, and GST-RalGDS-C127 at 23 ng (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) will have intracellular concentrations of 4.3, 0.16, and 1.1 μM, respectively. Under these conditions, v-H-Ras(G60A) should bind rather well to Raf-1 or RalGDS fragment and reduce its ability to sequester the true downstream target. Since it only requires a small amount of Raf-1 and RalGDS fragment to suppress v-H-Ras(G60A), this result suggests that oocytes need only a small percentage of total cellular downstream targets (or Raf-1) for propagating H-Ras signal. The same mechanism also explains the finding that high amounts of Raf-1 or RalGDS fragments are required to compete directly against the activity of v-H-Ras (Fig. 5B). Otherwise, any amount of competing Raf-1 or RalGDS fragment would have caused measurable v-H-Ras inhibition. A similar observation was reported by others using Raf-1 RBD fragment and oncogenic N-Ras (48Scheffler J.E. Waugh D.S. Bekesi E. Kiefer S.E. LoSardo J.E. Neri A. Prinzo K.M. Tsao K.-L. Wegrzynski B. Emerson S.D. Fry D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22340-22346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 7-fold more GST-RalGDS-C127 is needed to achieve a comparable level of v-H-Ras(G60A) suppression than that of GST-Raf-1-N275 (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). This phenomenon appears to be due to the difference in binding strength since RalGDS binding is more drastically reduced (by about 8-fold) by the G60A mutation than Raf-1 binding (32Chen Hwang M.-C. Sung Y.-J. Hwang Y.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8196-8202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the much reduced RalGDS binding by the G60A mutation argues against the possibility that RalGDS is a v-H-Ras(G60A) sequestered target unless oocytes contain very high endogenous RalGDS. The threshold appears to be around the equivalent of 23 ng of GST-RalGDS-C127 per oocyte since this is the concentration of RalGDS that can efficiently suppress v-H-Ras(G60A) (Fig. 6). Thus, RalGDS may only function as an opportunistic v-H-Ras(G60A) suppressor in our assay by virtue of its ability to titrate out v-H-Ras(G60A) at high concentrations.The membrane attachment requirement for v-H-Ras(G60A) to exert its dominant negative phenotype of v-H-Ras(G60A) distinguishes it from the RAST class of dominant negative mutants (47Gibbs J.B.

Wigler M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3039-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which need cytosolic proteins. Intriguingly, we found that while Raf-1 was highly effective against v-H-Ras(G60A), it could not suppress RasT. On the other hand, RasGAP suppressed RasT but not v-H-Ras(G60A). These observations imply that H-Ras requires both RasGAP and Raf-1 to transmit its mitogenic response. We cannot reconcile this apparent paradox at the present time. Since anti-Ras monoclonal antibodies Y13-259 and 6B7 have been shown to block insulin-induced oocyte GVBD (63Deshpande A.K. Kung H.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 7: 1285-1288Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 64Korn L.J. Siebel C.W. McCormick F. Roth R.A. Science. 1987; 236: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it was surprising to find v-H-Ras(G60A) had no effect against insulin (Table I). This result implies that insulin may employ signaling route(s) other than Raf-1, the known v-H-Ras(G60A) inhibition point, to promote GVBD. Several potential candidates exist, such as MEKK, REKS, and others (16Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Imazumi K. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol.

These MEK activators may represent possible insulin bypass points. It is also possible that v-H-Ras(G60A) inhibition is bypassed by other members of Raf family, such as A- and B-Raf (67Daum G. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Fries H.W. Troppmair J. Rapp U.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 474-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We are currently investigating these possibilities.Ras harboring the G60A mutation is a potent inhibitor that perturbs the H-Ras signaling pathway by sequestering essential downstream effector(s). The properties of the G60A mutant will be useful for elucidating the mechanism of H-Ras interacting with its downstream effectors as well as the signal transduction pathway(s) associated with H-Ras. INTRODUCTIONRas mediates the signaling of numerous growth factors and external stimuli by cycling between a GTP-bound active state and a GDP-bound inactive state (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1993; 62: 851-891Google Scholar). Ras is activated by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, which promote GDP to GTP exchange (1Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev.
