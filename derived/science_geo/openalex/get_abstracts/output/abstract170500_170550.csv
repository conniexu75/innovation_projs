In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, these storage lipids accumulate during stationary growth phase within organelles known as lipid bodies. We have used single and multiple gene disruptions to study storage lipid synthesis in yeast. Four genes, ARE1, ARE2, DGA1, and LRO1, were found to contribute to TAG synthesis. The most significant contribution is made byDGA1, which encodes a novel acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase. Two of the genes, ARE1 andARE2, are also involved in steryl ester synthesis. A yeast strain that lacks all four genes is viable and has no apparent growth defects under standard conditions. The strain is devoid of both TAG and steryl esters, and fluorescence microscopy revealed that it also lacks lipid bodies. We conclude that neither storage lipids nor lipid bodies are essential for growth in yeast. Steryl esters and triacylglycerol (TAG) are the main storage lipids in eukaryotic cells.

Storage lipids are usually found within special organelles known as lipid particles or lipid bodies (2Zweytick D. Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In yeast, these lipid bodies accumulate during stationary phase, and they can constitute up to 70% of the total lipid content of the cell (3Clausen M.K. Christiansen K. Jensen P.K. Benke O.

Several lipid-metabolizing enzymes are preferentially localized to the lipid bodies in yeast, and it has therefore been proposed that they do not solely serve as a depot for lipids but instead may have a more complex role in lipid biosynthesis, metabolism, degradation, and trafficking (6Leber R.

It has been shown that the other major storage lipid, TAG, can be synthesized in at least two different ways. One is an acyl-CoA-dependent reaction that is catalyzed by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Two different DGATs are known to exist in eukaryotes. One DGAT, also known as DGAT1, was first described in mammals but is also found in plants and is related to ASAT (12Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C.

In addition, a second DGAT, DGAT2, was recently identified in the fungus Mortiella ramanniana (14Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). DGAT2 is not related to any previously known enzyme, but genes encoding homologues of DGAT2 exist in other eukaryotes (14Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J.

In addition to the reaction catalyzed by the two types of DGATs, an acyl-CoA-independent pathway for TAG synthesis was also recently discovered in plants and yeast (16Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). This pathway involves the novel enzyme phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT), which can synthesize TAG from phospholipids and diacylglycerol (16Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). PDAT is distantly related to the mammalian enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and is encoded by the LRO1 gene in yeast (17Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15609-15612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We used single and multiple gene disruptions to study the relative contributions of the four genes, ARE1, ARE2,DGA1 and LRO1, to storage lipid synthesis in yeast. We find that the DGAT2 encoded by the DGA1 gene is the most important yeast enzyme involved in TAG synthesis. TheLRO1 gene, which encodes PDAT, also contributes significantly to TAG accumulation, whereas the products of theARE1 and ARE2 genes both make small but detectable contributions. Steryl ester synthesis is exclusively dependent on ARE1 and ARE2. Significantly, a strain that lacks all four genes contains neither storage lipids nor lipid bodies but is still viable. We conclude that storage lipid synthesis is non-essential in yeast. All strains used (Table I) are congenic to W303-1A (18Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.

Strains SCY60, SCY61, and SCY62 (the wild type control) were obtained from Stephen Sturley. Strains H1111 and H1112 were made by crossing SCY60 to SCY61 and dissecting tetrads. Other strains were made either by crosses or by successive one-step gene disruptions. Thelro1-Δ::URA3 andlro1-Δ::TRP1 disruptions were made by cloning the URA3 HindIII fragment or the TRP1 EcoRI fragment, respectively, between the BbsI andMunI sites of LRO1. To disrupt DGA1, an SmaI-SacI fragment carrying theKanMX4 marker was cloned between the ClaI andStuI sites in DGA1.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSCY60MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3SCY61MAT a are2-Δ∷LEU2 ADE2SCY62MAT a ADE2H1111MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 ADE2H1112MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 are2-Δ∷LEU2 ADE2H1228MAT a dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 ADE2H1025MAT a lro1-Δ∷URA3 ADE2H1226MAT a lro1-Δ∷URA3 dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 ADE2H1262MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 are2-Δ∷LEU2 lro1-Δ∷URA3 ADE2H1237MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 are2-Δ∷LEU2 dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 ADE2H1236MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 lro1-Δ∷TRP1 ADE2H1266MAT a are2-Δ∷LEU2 dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 lro1-Δ∷TRP1 ADE2H1246MATα are1-Δ∷HIS3 are2-Δ∷LEU2 dga1-Δ∷KanMX4 lro1-Δ∷TRP1 ADE2 Open table in a new tab Yeast cells were grown in YNB complete medium, which is yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Sigma), complete supplement mixture (Bio 101, Inc.), and 2% glucose. The cells were pre-cultivated on YNB complete plates for 1–2 days and then transferred to a preculture in liquid YNB. Stationary phase cells were grown for 52 h prior to being harvested. The total lipid content and lipid composition of the cells were determined as described previously (16Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In vitro DGAT activity was determined in crude extract of yeast cells in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Yeast cells were homogenized in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 0.2 ml of glass beads (0.45–0.5 mm in diameter) using a Mini Beadbeater-8 (Biospec Products) for three cycles of 60 s. Aliquots corresponding to 200 μg of protein were diluted to a total volume of 90 μl. To each aliquot, 10 μl of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (20 nmol, 5000 dpm/nmol) and di-6:0 diacylglycerol (5 nmol) were added. The suspension was thoroughly mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Lipids were extracted into chloroform (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck). The plate was first developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (85:15:10:3.5) for 80 mm. The dried plate was then developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1.5) for 180 mm using an automatic developing chamber (Camag). The radioactive lipids were quantified by electronic autoradiography (Instant Imager, Packard Instrument Co.). Aliquots of stationary phase cells (400 μl) were pelleted, washed twice in water, dissolved in 25 μl of water, and then stained with Nile Red (20Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The stained cells were incubated in the dark for 10 min, after which they were washed in water and then diluted into 100 μl of water. Prior to microscopy, the cells were mixed with ProLong Anti-fade reagent (Anti-fade kit, P-7481, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioscop 2 MOT (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen) equipped with an HBO 100 arc lamp system and a 63× plan apochromat objective with a fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence filter, using an excitation wavelength of 480–520 nm and emission at 510 nm. For the interference contrast images, a Nomarski prism was used instead of the fluorescence filter. We wanted to determine whether DGA1, LRO1,ARE1, and ARE2 are the only genes that contribute to storage lipid synthesis in yeast or whether other lipid-synthesizing pathways remain to be discovered. We additionally wanted to estimate the relative contribution of each gene to TAG and steryl ester synthesis. To this end, we made two sets of yeast strains (TableI). In the first set, each strain was disrupted for one of the four genes under study. A comparison of these single disrupted strains to the wild type allowed us to determine to what extent removal of one of the genes will reduce steryl ester or TAG accumulation. However, it is possible that up-regulation of one enzyme may compensate for the loss of another enzyme, particularly in the case of duplicated genes such as ARE1 and ARE2. We therefore also made a set of triple disrupted strains in which each strain expresses only one of the four genes. These strains allow us to determine the contribution to storage lipid synthesis of each enzyme in isolation. Finally, we also made a quadruple disrupted strain that lacks all four genes. We found that all seven strains are viable with normal growth rates. However, the final density of the quadruple disrupted strain in stationary phase is 75% of the wild type. Cell counting showed that this reflects a reduced cell number. The final densities of the other six strains all fell in the range between the wild type and the quadruple disrupted strain. Because storage lipids accumulate mainly during late exponential and stationary phase, we proceeded to analyze the lipid content of each strain after entry into stationary phase. We found that the lipid composition is strongly affected in several of the strains. Most significantly, the quadruple disrupted strain lacked storage lipids (Fig. 1). Because storage lipids constitute a major part of the lipids in stationary phase cells, the total lipid content is therefore reduced to 29% of the wild type strain (Fig. 1). From this we conclude that the four genes under study are the only genes that contribute to storage lipid synthesis in yeast, and also that storage lipids are not essential for growth. It should be noted, however, that the quadruple disrupted strain shows a reduced survival after nitrogen starvation (data not shown), indicating that the ability to accumulate storage lipids is important for long term survival in stationary phase. To determine to what extent the absence of storage lipid synthesis in the quadruple disrupted strain affects the lipid composition in general, we also measured the amounts of fatty acid, diacylglycerol, and polar lipid in both exponential and stationary phase cells. As shown in Table II, there are only minor differences between the quadruple disrupted strain and the wild type in exponential phase, where the amount of storage lipids is low. In stationary phase, the quadruple disrupted strain has a 2.5-fold increase in fatty acids and a 3.7-fold decrease in diacylglycerol, as compared with the wild type (Table II). These changes are significant but should be interpreted with some caution, particularly in the case of fatty acids that are easily generated by lipid hydrolysis during the extraction procedure (5Rattray J.B.M. Ratledge C.I. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial Lipids. 1. Academic Press, London1988: 555-697Google Scholar).Table IILipid composition of wild type and quadruple disrupted yeast strainsExponentialStationaryWild typeH1246Wild typeH1246Steryl ester0.2 ± 0.20.0 ± 0.016.5 ± 0.50.2 ± 0.1Triacylglycerol17.7 ± 1.00.2 ± 0.0160.2 ± 2.20.3 ± 0.32-aS.D.

(n = 4). It is evident that all four genes contribute to TAG synthesis in vivo, because only the quadruple disrupted strain is completely devoid of TAG (Fig. 1). However, the contribution of each gene varies significantly. Thus, the triple disrupted strains carrying only the DGA1 or LRO1 gene synthesizes TAG at 87 and 38% of the wild type level, respectively (Fig. 1). In contrast, triple disrupted strains carrying ARE1 orARE2 synthesize only minute, but still detectable, amounts of TAG. We conclude that the DGAT2 enzyme encoded by DGA1 is the major TAG-synthesizing enzyme in yeast. Consistent with this, thedga1 strain was the only single disrupted strain where the amount of TAG, and also the total amount of fatty acids, was significantly reduced (Fig. 1). Unlike the case with TAG, and consistent with previous findings (7Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we found that only two of the genes, ARE1 andARE2, contribute to steryl ester accumulation. Thus, triple disrupted strains carrying only DGA1 or LRO1 lack steryl esters (Fig. 1). We further note that although ARE1and ARE2 are the only two genes involved in steryl ester synthesis, the amount of steryl esters made by the strain carrying onlyARE1 (8% of wild type) or ARE2 (48% of wild type) does not add up to 100%. However, steryl ester synthesis is significantly higher in the corresponding single disrupted strains,i.e. when either ARE1 or ARE2 is present together with DGA1 and LRO1. We wanted to determine to what extent the observed in vivo effects on TAG levels correlate with TAG-synthesizing DGAT activity in vitro. We therefore proceeded to assay extracts from different yeast strains for DGAT activity (Table III). We found that although extracts from the strain expressing only DGA1 have an acyl-CoA-dependent TAG synthesis that is comparable with that of the wild type, the activity is much lower or absent in extracts from the other strains. This suggests that the DGAT2 enzyme encoded byDGA1 is responsible for most of the DGAT activity in wild type yeast cells. The triple disrupted strains expressing eitherARE1 or ARE2 also have some DGAT activity, although 60–100-fold lower than the wild type. This is consistent with the notion that the small amount of TAG present in these strains is made in an acyl-CoA-dependent reaction. Extracts from the strain expressing only LRO1, which should be devoid of DGAT activity, also incorporate acyl groups from acyl-CoA into TAG. This is most likely due to an acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferase that is present in yeast (21Richard M.G. McMaster C.R. Lipids. 1998; 33: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It will generate labeled phospholipid, which can be metabolized into TAG in a reaction catalyzed by PDAT, the enzyme encoded by LRO1. Accordingly, the limited TAG formation in this strain would not reflect a DGAT activity of LRO1 but rather its PDAT activity described previously (16Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 17Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T.

Extracts from the quadruple disrupted strain produced very small amounts of labeled TAG. When analyzed further, we came to the conclusion that these minute amounts of TAG are produced non-enzymatically, as reported previously (22Stobart K. Mancha M. Lenman M. Dahlqvist A. Stymne S. Planta. 1997; 203: 58-66Google Scholar).Table IIIIncorporation of palmitoyl-CoA into TAG in yeast extractsStrainExpressed geneLabeled TAG% wild typeH1262DGA1112.2 ± 6.3H1237LRO13.3 ± 0.3H1236ARE21.0 ± 0.1H1266ARE11.7 ± 0.1H1246None0.4 ± 0.1The incorporation of [14C]palmitoyl-CoA into TAG was assayedin vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data shown is the mean ± S.E.

The major fatty acids that accumulate in yeast are palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, and oleic acids. In addition, trace amounts of lauric, myristic, and cis-vaccenic acid are also found. To determine whether a reduced or absent storage lipid synthesis would affect the balance between different fatty acids, we proceeded to analyze the fatty acid composition in our wild type, triple disrupted, and quadruple disrupted strains (TableIV). Interestingly, we found that whereas the triple disrupted strain carrying only DGA1 has a fatty acid composition that is similar to that of the wild type strain, the other triple disrupted strains, which lack DGA1, accumulate significant amounts of vaccenic acid. Moreover, the amount of palmitoleic acid is also elevated in these strains, whereas the amount of palmitic acid is reduced as compared with the wild type (Table IV). The relative distribution of the fatty acids was similar in steryl esters, TAG, and total lipids (data not shown). We conclude that the fatty acid composition of the cell is altered in yeast strains that lack the DGAT2 enzyme encoded by DGA1, perhaps as a consequence of the reduced TAG synthesis in these strains.Table IVFatty acid composition of total lipid in stationary phase yeast cellsWild type,4-aStrains are indicated with the expressed gene. all fourH1262,DGA1H1237, LRO1H1236,ARE2H1266, ARE1H1246, NonePalmitic acid (16:0)15.4 ± 0.110.9 ± 0.17.7 ± 0.110.8 ± 0.18.6 ± 0.18.1 ± 0.2Palmitoleic acid (16:1 Δ9)29.8 ± 0.331.7 ± 0.237.0 ± 0.437.8 ± 0.333.3 ± 0.232.5 ± 0.1Stearic acid (18:0)9.9 ± 0.29.7 ± 0.17.9 ± 0.17.7 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.19.5 ± 0.1Oleic acid (18:1 Δ9)44.6 ± 0.347.6 ± 0.344.1 ± 0.440.9 ± 0.340.9 ± 0.142.7 ± 0.3Vaccenic acid (18:1 Δ11)0.1 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.13.4 ± 0.27.6 ± 0.17.3 ± 0.1Results are expressed as percent of the total fatty acid in each strain and represent the mean ± S.E.

Because the main content of the lipid bodies that accumulate during stationary phase are TAG and steryl esters, we wanted to determine whether they could be formed in the absence of either of these lipids. The lipid bodies can be visualized using the fluorescent dye Nile Red (20Greenspan P. Mayer E.P. Fowler S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). We therefore stained yeast cells that had been grown to late stationary phase with this dye. As shown in Fig.2, we found that whereas lipid bodies are abundantly present in the wild type (Fig. 2 A), they are completely absent in the quadruple disrupted strain (Fig.2 F). We next examined the role of each gene in lipid body formation, using the triple disrupted strains. We found that all four strains contain lipid bodies (Fig. 2, B–E), whose prominence appears to correlate with the storage lipid content (Fig.1). The fact that the strains expressing only DGA1 orLRO1, which contain only TAG but no steryl esters, are able to form lipid bodies shows that steryl esters are not required for their formation. We were not able to test whether TAG is required for their formation in the presence of steryl esters, because the strains expressing only ARE1 or ARE2 still make small amounts of TAG (Fig. 1). From these experiments we conclude that lipid bodies fail to form in the absence of both storage lipids and also that these organelles are not essential for growth under normal conditions. In the present investigation, we show that four yeast genes,ARE1, ARE2, LRO1, and DGA1, contribute to TAG and steryl ester accumulation, and that no other pathways exist for the synthesis of these storage lipids in yeast (Fig.1). We further show that storage lipid synthesis is required for lipid body formation (Fig. 2) and that neither storage lipids nor lipid bodies are essential for growth. The ability to accumulate storage lipids does, however, influence long term survival of stationary phase cells, as evidenced by a reduced survival of the quadruple disrupted strain during nitrogen starvation. The DGAT2 encoded by DGA1 (14Lardizabal K.D. Mai J.T. Wagner N.W. Wyrick A. Voelker T. Hawkins D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38862-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) seems to be the most important enzyme for TAG synthesis in yeast. Thus, the strain expressing only DGA1 has 87% of the wild type TAG level (Fig. 1). Conversely, the amount of TAG (and also total lipids) is significantly reduced in the single disrupted strain lackingDGA1, which shows that none of the other genes can fully substitute for its role in TAG synthesis. The second most important gene involved in TAG synthesis clearly is LRO1, which encodes the PDAT enzyme (16Dahlqvist A. Ståhl U. Lenman M. Banas A. Lee M. Sandager L. Ronne H. Stymne S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6487-6492Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 17Oelkers P. Tinkelenberg A. Erdeniz N. Cromley D. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the strain expressing onlyLRO1 has 38% of the wild type TAG level, and the TAG content is somewhat reduced in the strain lacking LRO1 (Fig.1). Interestingly, we further found that both ARE1 andARE2 contribute to TAG synthesis, although at a much lower level. This is evident from the strains expressing only ARE1or ARE2, both of which contain small but still detectable amounts of TAG. Because some plant and animal homologues ofARE1 and ARE2 possess DGAT activity (12Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K.

Consistent with previous observations (7Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A. Deckelbaum R.J. Aljinovic G. Pohl T.M. Rothstein R. Sturley S.L.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we found that steryl ester accumulation is dependent only on ARE1 andARE2. The amounts of steryl esters made in strains carrying only ARE1 or ARE2 do not add up to wild type levels, but steryl ester accumulation is much higher in the corresponding single disrupted strains carrying DGA1 andLRO1 together with either ARE1 or ARE2(Fig. 1). This suggests that although DGA1 andLRO1 do not themselves contribute to steryl ester synthesis, their presence does permit a more efficient accumulation of steryl esters. It is conceivable that this reflects a more efficient lipid body formation in the presence of normal amounts of TAG. We further note while ARE2 is the most important gene for steryl ester synthesis, ARE1 makes a comparatively larger contribution to TAG accumulation. It is conceivable that this reflects the same kind of functional differentiation that produced two distinct but related enzymes, DGAT1 and ASAT, in higher eukaryotes (10Chang C.C.Y. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.H. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J.

Bechtold N. Caboche M. Lepiniec L. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that the ARE1- and ARE2-encoded proteins are much more similar to each other than either of them is to the ASATs and DGAT1s in higher eukaryotes. We conclude thatARE1 and ARE2 are not direct homologues of the latter, but rather the products of a more recent gene duplication in yeast. Besides the absence of triacylglycerol and steryl ester, the quadruple disrupted strain also fails to accumulate diacylglycerol in stationary phase (Table II). This is in contrast to the wild type, which has 3 times more diacylglycerol in stationary phase than during exponential growth. Diacylglycerol is still present in the quadruple disrupted strain but only at the lower level seen in exponential phase. This finding suggests that the increased diacylglycerol level in wild type stationary phase cells is causally related to the increased synthesis of storage lipids, notably triacylglycerol. We further found that the fatty acid composition is altered in yeast cells that lack the TAG-synthesizing DGAT2 encoded by DGA1 (Table IV). Thus, there is an increase in both vaccenic and palmitoleic acid, while the amount of palmitic acid is reduced. The reason for these changes is not known, but we note that palmitoyl-CoA is converted to palmitoleoyl-CoA and then to vaccenoyl-CoA in two consecutive reactions catalyzed by a desaturase and an elongase, respectively. Reducing or eliminating the acyl-CoA-dependent TAG synthesis is likely to affect both the size and the composition of the acyl-CoA pool, with resulting effects also on fatty acid composition. In conclusion, we have shown that DGA1, LRO1,ARE1, and ARE2 are the only yeast genes involved in storage lipid synthesis, and also that the DGAT2 encoded byDGA1 is the most important enzyme for TAG synthesis. Finally, we have shown that neither storage lipid synthesis nor lipid body formation is essential for growth in yeast. It has been proposed that the latter do not simply serve as inert lipid stores but also play an important role in the biosynthesis, mobilization, and trafficking of intracellular lipids (1Murphy D.J.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that lipid bodies are important for some of these functions; however, our results suggest that a process that is exclusively localized to the lipid bodies or in some other way dependent on them cannot be essential for growth.

Conversely, bisphosphonates, stable analogs of pyrophosphate commonly used for the management of osteoporosis, prevent osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid excess in vitro and in vivo (7Plotkin L.I.

The anti-apoptotic effect of these agents requires the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).1 However, the events triggered by bisphosphonates upstream of ERKs have remained heretofore unknown.Gap junction channels are formed by two hemichannels, each formed by six molecules of connexin (Cx) and contributed by one of the two adjacent cells. The Cx superfamily comprises at least 15 proteins expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Cxs are highly homologous and share similar topology: four membrane spanning domains, two extracellular and one intracellular loop (8Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, channels formed by different Cxs differ in their permeability to intracellular metabolites and second messengers (9Cao F. Eckert R. Elfgang C. Nitsche J.M. Snyder S.A.

Cx-43 is the major gap junction protein expressed in cells of the osteoblastic lineage and may mediate communication among cells of the osteocyte network (11Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Warlow P.M.

Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar).An essential role of Cxs in physiology has been established by the evidence that spontaneous Cx mutations in humans or loss of Cx function by gene targeting in mice is associated with severe disorders, including demyelinating neuropathies, deafness, congenital cataracts, and even death (16White T.W. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 283-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Hodgins M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 2-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, knowledge of the direct cause-effect relationship between altered intercellular communication and the defect is lacking. Importantly, different mutations of the same Cx gene cause different disorders (17Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Hodgins M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 2-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that different domains of the same protein are involved in distinct physiologic processes. Hence, it remains unclear whether the pathologies induced by the specific mutations or by Cx deficiency result from altered gap junction communication or from loss of Cx functions that are independent of gap junctions. A role of Cxs in processes independent of gap junctions has been strongly suggested by evidence that Cx hemichannels operate in nonjunctional regions of the plasma membrane (18John S.A. Kondo R.

Science. 2001; 292: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition, Cx-43 interacts directly with Src, a protein that participates in the transduction of signals induced by a multitude of extracellular stimuli (22Loo L.W. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Carcinogen. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Giepmans B.N. Hengeveld T. Postma F.R. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8544-8549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This evidence has raised the possibility that Cx-43 hemichannels may, directly or indirectly, activate intracellular signaling. Thus, Cxs in general, and Cx-43 in particular, may be involved in the communication not just between adjacent cells but also between cells and their extracellular environment.The studies reported herein demonstrate that Cx-43 hemichannels are essential for the transduction of the anti-apoptotic signal of bisphosphonates and that hemichannel opening leads to the activation of the Src/ERKs signal transduction pathway. These results establish a novel paradigm of Cx-43 function as transducer of extracellular signals and a role for this protein, independent of its well established role in cell-to-cell communication via gap junctions, in the regulation of cell survival.DISCUSSIONThe studies reported in this paper demonstrate that the bisphosphonate alendronate, a small synthetic molecule of 250 Da, efficacious in the treatment of several metabolic bone diseases, exerts anti-apoptotic effects on osteocytes and osteoblasts by opening Cx-43 hemichannels and that hemichannel opening in turn activates the Src kinase and ERKs. These findings establish a previously unsuspected role of Cx-43 in the regulation of cell survival and elucidate a novel function of this protein, in addition to its well known role in gap junction communication. Moreover, our findings with alendronate imply that naturally occurring small molecules must exist in the extracellular milieu which deliver anti-apoptotic signals through their ability to gate Cx-43 hemichannels.Heretofore, the only known biologic role of Cxs was in intercellular communication and specifically the formation of full channels (gap junctions) between neighboring cells. Trafficking of small molecules through gap junctions was known to exert regulatory influences on cell proliferation and differentiation. While our manuscript was in preparation, Kamermans et al. (21Kamermans M. Fahrenfort I. Schultz K. Janssen-Bienhold U. Sjoerdsma T. Weiler R. Science. 2001; 292: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) reported that hemichannels formed by Cx-26 are critical for the transmission of signals between neurons in the retina. The evidence presented herein that MAP kinases can be activated by hemichannel opening and that Cxs play a role in the transduction of survival signals in response to extracellular cues adds Cx-43 hemichannels to the large list of transmembrane proteins, e.g. growth factor receptors, G protein coupled receptors, integrins, etc., capable of transducing extracellular signals to intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell survival.The precise mechanism by which exposure to alendronate leads to opening of Cx-43 hemichannels in osteocytes/osteoblasts is a matter of conjecture at the present time. Osteoclasts, the highly specialized polykaryons responsible for the resorption of bone, like osteoblasts and osteocytes, are targets of bisphosphonate action. Specifically, bisphosphonates act on osteoclasts to induce their apoptosis (44Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Uy H.L. Sasaki A. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). This mechanism underlies the potent antiresorptive actions of this class of drugs. Some bisphosphonates, including alendronate, trigger osteoclast apoptosis by inhibiting enzymes of the mevalonate pathway which prenylate survival proteins, such as Ras, whereas others form cytotoxic analogs of ATP (45Luckman S.P.

Res. 1997; 12: 1358-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is thought that bisphosphonates buried in the bone matrix by virtue of their high affinity for hydroxyapatite reach the osteoclast interior following osteoclastic bone resorption and the phagocytosis of particles of matrix containing the drug (48Sato M. Grasser W. Endo N. Akins R. Simmons H. Thompson D.D. Golub E. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). However, the results of the present report together with evidence that osteoclasts express Cx-43 (49Ilvesaro J. Väänänen K. Tuukkanen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that both in osteoblastic/osteocytic cells and osteoclasts the drugs might enter the interior of the cells through Cx-43 hemichannels. In any event, the absolute requirement of Cx-43 for the effect of alendronate on osteoblasts and osteocytes, and for that matter in HeLa cells transfected with Cx-43, strongly suggests that bisphosphonates either interact directly with this protein or somehow recognize and interact with another membrane moiety associated with Cx-43. Hemichannel opening may result from direct or indirect interaction of bisphosphonates with Cx-43, which leads to alteration of the tertiary and/or quaternary structures of Cx-43. Future studies will of course be needed to establish the nature of this putative “receptor-like” role of Cx-43 in alendronate action.Each of the six Cx-43 proteins making up the hemichannel has two distinct domains: a transmembrane domain that participates in the formation of the pore of the hemichannel and a C-terminal domain that contains the proline-rich SH3 and SH2 binding sites required for the interaction of Cx-43 with Src. The results of our experiments with truncated mutants consisting of only the pore forming domain or the C-terminal domain indicate that both regions are needed for the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate. In addition, because the truncated form of Cx-43 lacking the C-tail (Cx-43Δ245) forms channels with permeability similar to that exhibited by wild type Cx-43 (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the inability of this mutant to transduce the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate implies that communication between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space is not sufficient for this effect. In fact, the restoration of the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate in HeLa cells by cotransfection of the pore forming region together with the C-terminal tail in our experiments is fully consistent with the contention that the transduction of the cell survival signal requires the association of the two portions of the molecule through intramolecular noncovalent interactions, the so-called “ball-and-chain” mechanism described previously by Hoshi and co-workers (50Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ball-and-chain mechanism has been also evoked to explain the closing of Cx-43 gap junction channels in response to Src, pH changes, as well as insulin (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 51Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys.

Res. 1998; 83: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Based on our results and the lines of supporting evidence discussed above, we propose that a direct or indirect interaction of alendronate with the Cx-43 pore forming region is responsible for opening the hemichannel, whereas the Cx-43 C-terminal portion of the molecule serves as the docking site for Src kinase(s) or other adaptor molecules. The subsequent Src activation evidently links Cx-43 with the ERK pathway (Fig. 6). The sequential nature of the events depicted in the figure is fully supported by the results of our experiments with dominant negative kinases (Fig. 5). Our model also provides for the transient nature of the hemichannel opening by bisphosphonates. Specifically, we propose that activation of Src and ERKs not only will attenuate cell death but will also cause the closure of the hemichannels by phosphorylating the C terminus of Cx-43. This particular contention is fully supported by previous evidence that phosphorylation of the C-terminal portion of Cx-43 by these kinases results in channel closure (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 42Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol.

Whether bisphosphonates induce phosphorylation of Cx-43 will require further studies.At this stage, the identity of putative naturally occurring small molecules that may control Cx-43 hemichannel opening leading to survival signals is only a matter of conjecture. Nonetheless, changes in calcium concentrations within the physiological range as well as removal of extracellular calcium by chelators, such as EGTA, do open Cx-43 hemichannels (19Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP and metabolic inhibitors also open Cx-43 hemichannels. However, in distinction to extracellular calcium removal or bisphosphonates, extracellular ATP and metabolic inhibitors induce permanent opening of the hemichannels and cell death (18John S.A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2520-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although a major action of bisphosphonates is prevention of bone resorption resulting from the drugs' ability to induce osteoclast apoptosis, bisphosphonates have been surprisingly effective in the management of skeletal disorders unrelated to abnormal osteoclastic resorption. Indeed, treatment with bisphosphonates benefits children with severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant familial disease caused by abnormalities in the synthesis of collagen type I by osteoblasts (56Glorieux F.H. Bishop N.J. Plotkin H. Chabot G. Lanoue G. Travers R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Likewise, bisphosphonates seem efficacious in idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, a disease of decreased osteoblast performance of unknown etiology (57Brumsen C. Hamdy N.A. Papapoulos S.E. Medicine (Baltimore). 1997; 76: 266-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). On the other hand, targeted disruption of the Cx-43 gene in mice results in delayed ossification and generalized osteoblast dysfunction (15Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results of the present report, these observations raise the possibility that Cx-43-transduced survival signals are indeed of critical importance for the normal function of osteoblasts. Consequently, gating of Cx-43 hemichannels by small molecules present in the bone microenvironment may be one important mechanism for maintaining osteoblast survival and thereby skeletal homeostasis.In conclusion, the findings reported in this paper elucidate a novel paradigm of signal transduction mediated by Cx-43 and open new avenues of investigation aiming to examine the possibility that Cx-43 hemichannels are utilized by endogenous molecules and perhaps drugs other than bisphosphonates to transduce cell survival signals. Osteocytes, former osteoblasts entombed in the mineralized bone matrix, communicate with each other and with osteoblasts on the bone surface through gap junctions, clusters of channels that connect directly the cytoplasm of neighboring cells (1Doty S.B.

Conversely, bisphosphonates, stable analogs of pyrophosphate commonly used for the management of osteoporosis, prevent osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid excess in vitro and in vivo (7Plotkin L.I. Weinstein R.S. Parfitt A.M. Roberson P.K. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1363-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic effect of these agents requires the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs).1 However, the events triggered by bisphosphonates upstream of ERKs have remained heretofore unknown. Gap junction channels are formed by two hemichannels, each formed by six molecules of connexin (Cx) and contributed by one of the two adjacent cells. The Cx superfamily comprises at least 15 proteins expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Cxs are highly homologous and share similar topology: four membrane spanning domains, two extracellular and one intracellular loop (8Unger V.M. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Yeager M. Science. 1999; 283: 1176-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, channels formed by different Cxs differ in their permeability to intracellular metabolites and second messengers (9Cao F. Eckert R. Elfgang C. Nitsche J.M. Snyder S.A.

Cx-43 is the major gap junction protein expressed in cells of the osteoblastic lineage and may mediate communication among cells of the osteocyte network (11Civitelli R. Beyer E.C. Warlow P.M.

Res. 2000; 15: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Lack of Cx-43 in vitro orin vivo results in osteoblast dysfunction and delayed ossification (14Lecanda F. Towler D.A. Ziambaras K. Cheng S.L. Koval M. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2249-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). An essential role of Cxs in physiology has been established by the evidence that spontaneous Cx mutations in humans or loss of Cx function by gene targeting in mice is associated with severe disorders, including demyelinating neuropathies, deafness, congenital cataracts, and even death (16White T.W. Paul D.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 283-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 17Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Hodgins M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 2-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, in most cases, knowledge of the direct cause-effect relationship between altered intercellular communication and the defect is lacking. Importantly, different mutations of the same Cx gene cause different disorders (17Kelsell D.P. Dunlop J. Hodgins M.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 2-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that different domains of the same protein are involved in distinct physiologic processes. Hence, it remains unclear whether the pathologies induced by the specific mutations or by Cx deficiency result from altered gap junction communication or from loss of Cx functions that are independent of gap junctions. A role of Cxs in processes independent of gap junctions has been strongly suggested by evidence that Cx hemichannels operate in nonjunctional regions of the plasma membrane (18John S.A. Kondo R.

Science. 2001; 292: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In addition, Cx-43 interacts directly with Src, a protein that participates in the transduction of signals induced by a multitude of extracellular stimuli (22Loo L.W. Kanemitsu M.Y. Lau A.F. Mol. Carcinogen. 1999; 25: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23Giepmans B.N. Hengeveld T. Postma F.R. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8544-8549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This evidence has raised the possibility that Cx-43 hemichannels may, directly or indirectly, activate intracellular signaling. Thus, Cxs in general, and Cx-43 in particular, may be involved in the communication not just between adjacent cells but also between cells and their extracellular environment. The studies reported herein demonstrate that Cx-43 hemichannels are essential for the transduction of the anti-apoptotic signal of bisphosphonates and that hemichannel opening leads to the activation of the Src/ERKs signal transduction pathway. These results establish a novel paradigm of Cx-43 function as transducer of extracellular signals and a role for this protein, independent of its well established role in cell-to-cell communication via gap junctions, in the regulation of cell survival. DISCUSSIONThe studies reported in this paper demonstrate that the bisphosphonate alendronate, a small synthetic molecule of 250 Da, efficacious in the treatment of several metabolic bone diseases, exerts anti-apoptotic effects on osteocytes and osteoblasts by opening Cx-43 hemichannels and that hemichannel opening in turn activates the Src kinase and ERKs. These findings establish a previously unsuspected role of Cx-43 in the regulation of cell survival and elucidate a novel function of this protein, in addition to its well known role in gap junction communication. Moreover, our findings with alendronate imply that naturally occurring small molecules must exist in the extracellular milieu which deliver anti-apoptotic signals through their ability to gate Cx-43 hemichannels.Heretofore, the only known biologic role of Cxs was in intercellular communication and specifically the formation of full channels (gap junctions) between neighboring cells. Trafficking of small molecules through gap junctions was known to exert regulatory influences on cell proliferation and differentiation. While our manuscript was in preparation, Kamermans et al. (21Kamermans M. Fahrenfort I. Schultz K. Janssen-Bienhold U. Sjoerdsma T. Weiler R. Science. 2001; 292: 1178-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) reported that hemichannels formed by Cx-26 are critical for the transmission of signals between neurons in the retina. The evidence presented herein that MAP kinases can be activated by hemichannel opening and that Cxs play a role in the transduction of survival signals in response to extracellular cues adds Cx-43 hemichannels to the large list of transmembrane proteins, e.g. growth factor receptors, G protein coupled receptors, integrins, etc., capable of transducing extracellular signals to intracellular signaling pathways that influence cell survival.The precise mechanism by which exposure to alendronate leads to opening of Cx-43 hemichannels in osteocytes/osteoblasts is a matter of conjecture at the present time. Osteoclasts, the highly specialized polykaryons responsible for the resorption of bone, like osteoblasts and osteocytes, are targets of bisphosphonate action. Specifically, bisphosphonates act on osteoclasts to induce their apoptosis (44Hughes D.E. Wright K.R. Uy H.L. Sasaki A. Yoneda T. Roodman G.D. Mundy G.R. Boyce B.F. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). This mechanism underlies the potent antiresorptive actions of this class of drugs. Some bisphosphonates, including alendronate, trigger osteoclast apoptosis by inhibiting enzymes of the mevalonate pathway which prenylate survival proteins, such as Ras, whereas others form cytotoxic analogs of ATP (45Luckman S.P.

Res. 1997; 12: 1358-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is thought that bisphosphonates buried in the bone matrix by virtue of their high affinity for hydroxyapatite reach the osteoclast interior following osteoclastic bone resorption and the phagocytosis of particles of matrix containing the drug (48Sato M. Grasser W. Endo N. Akins R. Simmons H. Thompson D.D. Golub E. Rodan G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). However, the results of the present report together with evidence that osteoclasts express Cx-43 (49Ilvesaro J. Väänänen K. Tuukkanen J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) raise the possibility that both in osteoblastic/osteocytic cells and osteoclasts the drugs might enter the interior of the cells through Cx-43 hemichannels. In any event, the absolute requirement of Cx-43 for the effect of alendronate on osteoblasts and osteocytes, and for that matter in HeLa cells transfected with Cx-43, strongly suggests that bisphosphonates either interact directly with this protein or somehow recognize and interact with another membrane moiety associated with Cx-43. Hemichannel opening may result from direct or indirect interaction of bisphosphonates with Cx-43, which leads to alteration of the tertiary and/or quaternary structures of Cx-43. Future studies will of course be needed to establish the nature of this putative “receptor-like” role of Cx-43 in alendronate action.Each of the six Cx-43 proteins making up the hemichannel has two distinct domains: a transmembrane domain that participates in the formation of the pore of the hemichannel and a C-terminal domain that contains the proline-rich SH3 and SH2 binding sites required for the interaction of Cx-43 with Src. The results of our experiments with truncated mutants consisting of only the pore forming domain or the C-terminal domain indicate that both regions are needed for the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate. In addition, because the truncated form of Cx-43 lacking the C-tail (Cx-43Δ245) forms channels with permeability similar to that exhibited by wild type Cx-43 (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the inability of this mutant to transduce the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate implies that communication between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space is not sufficient for this effect. In fact, the restoration of the anti-apoptotic effect of alendronate in HeLa cells by cotransfection of the pore forming region together with the C-terminal tail in our experiments is fully consistent with the contention that the transduction of the cell survival signal requires the association of the two portions of the molecule through intramolecular noncovalent interactions, the so-called “ball-and-chain” mechanism described previously by Hoshi and co-workers (50Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ball-and-chain mechanism has been also evoked to explain the closing of Cx-43 gap junction channels in response to Src, pH changes, as well as insulin (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 51Morley G.E. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Biophys.

Res. 1998; 83: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Based on our results and the lines of supporting evidence discussed above, we propose that a direct or indirect interaction of alendronate with the Cx-43 pore forming region is responsible for opening the hemichannel, whereas the Cx-43 C-terminal portion of the molecule serves as the docking site for Src kinase(s) or other adaptor molecules. The subsequent Src activation evidently links Cx-43 with the ERK pathway (Fig. 6). The sequential nature of the events depicted in the figure is fully supported by the results of our experiments with dominant negative kinases (Fig. 5). Our model also provides for the transient nature of the hemichannel opening by bisphosphonates. Specifically, we propose that activation of Src and ERKs not only will attenuate cell death but will also cause the closure of the hemichannels by phosphorylating the C terminus of Cx-43. This particular contention is fully supported by previous evidence that phosphorylation of the C-terminal portion of Cx-43 by these kinases results in channel closure (24Zhou L. Kasperek E.M. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 42Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W. Simon S. Lau A.F. Eckhart W. J. Biol.

Whether bisphosphonates induce phosphorylation of Cx-43 will require further studies.At this stage, the identity of putative naturally occurring small molecules that may control Cx-43 hemichannel opening leading to survival signals is only a matter of conjecture. Nonetheless, changes in calcium concentrations within the physiological range as well as removal of extracellular calcium by chelators, such as EGTA, do open Cx-43 hemichannels (19Quist A.P. Rhee S.K. Lin H. Lal R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP and metabolic inhibitors also open Cx-43 hemichannels. However, in distinction to extracellular calcium removal or bisphosphonates, extracellular ATP and metabolic inhibitors induce permanent opening of the hemichannels and cell death (18John S.A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2520-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Although a major action of bisphosphonates is prevention of bone resorption resulting from the drugs' ability to induce osteoclast apoptosis, bisphosphonates have been surprisingly effective in the management of skeletal disorders unrelated to abnormal osteoclastic resorption. Indeed, treatment with bisphosphonates benefits children with severe forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant familial disease caused by abnormalities in the synthesis of collagen type I by osteoblasts (56Glorieux F.H. Bishop N.J. Plotkin H. Chabot G. Lanoue G. Travers R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 339: 947-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Likewise, bisphosphonates seem efficacious in idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, a disease of decreased osteoblast performance of unknown etiology (57Brumsen C. Hamdy N.A. Papapoulos S.E. Medicine (Baltimore). 1997; 76: 266-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). On the other hand, targeted disruption of the Cx-43 gene in mice results in delayed ossification and generalized osteoblast dysfunction (15Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results of the present report, these observations raise the possibility that Cx-43-transduced survival signals are indeed of critical importance for the normal function of osteoblasts. Consequently, gating of Cx-43 hemichannels by small molecules present in the bone microenvironment may be one important mechanism for maintaining osteoblast survival and thereby skeletal homeostasis.In conclusion, the findings reported in this paper elucidate a novel paradigm of signal transduction mediated by Cx-43 and open new avenues of investigation aiming to examine the possibility that Cx-43 hemichannels are utilized by endogenous molecules and perhaps drugs other than bisphosphonates to transduce cell survival signals. The studies reported in this paper demonstrate that the bisphosphonate alendronate, a small synthetic molecule of 250 Da, efficacious in the treatment of several metabolic bone diseases, exerts anti-apoptotic effects on osteocytes and osteoblasts by opening Cx-43 hemichannels and that hemichannel opening in turn activates the Src kinase and ERKs.

Likewise, bisphosphonates seem efficacious in idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis, a disease of decreased osteoblast performance of unknown etiology (57Brumsen C. Hamdy N.A. Papapoulos S.E. Medicine (Baltimore). 1997; 76: 266-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). On the other hand, targeted disruption of the Cx-43 gene in mice results in delayed ossification and generalized osteoblast dysfunction (15Lecanda F. Warlow P.M. Sheikh S. Furlan F. Steinberg T.H. Civitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 931-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Taken together with the results of the present report, these observations raise the possibility that Cx-43-transduced survival signals are indeed of critical importance for the normal function of osteoblasts. Consequently, gating of Cx-43 hemichannels by small molecules present in the bone microenvironment may be one important mechanism for maintaining osteoblast survival and thereby skeletal homeostasis. In conclusion, the findings reported in this paper elucidate a novel paradigm of signal transduction mediated by Cx-43 and open new avenues of investigation aiming to examine the possibility that Cx-43 hemichannels are utilized by endogenous molecules and perhaps drugs other than bisphosphonates to transduce cell survival signals.

https://openalex.org/W2000489928,"Members of the epidermal growth factor receptor, or ErbB, family of receptor tyrosine kinases have a single transmembrane (TM) α-helix that is usually assumed to play a passive role in ligand-induced dimerization and activation of the receptor. However, recent studies with the epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) and the erythropoietin receptor have indicated that interactions between TM α-helices do contribute to stabilization of ligand-independent and/or ligand-induced receptor dimers. In addition, not all of the expected ErbB receptor ligand-induced dimerization events can be recapitulated using isolated extracellular domains, suggesting that other regions of the receptor, such as the TM domain, may contribute to dimerization in vivo. Using an approach for analyzing TM domain interactions in Escherichia colicell membranes, named TOXCAT, we find that the TM domains of ErbB receptors self-associate strongly in the absence of their extracellular domains, with the rank order ErbB4-TM > ErbB1-TM ≈ ErbB2-TM > ErbB3-TM. A limited mutational analysis suggests that dimerization of these TM domains involves one or more GXXXG motifs, which occur frequently in the TM domains of receptor tyrosine kinases and are critical for stabilizing the glycophorin A TM domain dimer. We also analyzed the effect of the valine to glutamic acid mutation in ErbB2 that constitutively activates this receptor. Contrary to our expectations, this mutation reduced rather than increased ErbB2-TM dimerization. Our findings suggest a role for TM domain interactions in ErbB receptor function, possibly in stabilizing inactive ligand-independent receptor dimers that have been observed by several groups.

The ErbB (or HER) family of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases has four members: the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are:EGFepidermal growth factorCAMchloramphenicolCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseECextracellularEPOerythropoietinErbBproduct of oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus (receptors in the EGF receptor family)GpAglycophorin AMBPmaltose-binding proteinTMtransmembraneZOIzone of inhibition 1The abbreviations used are:EGFepidermal growth factorCAMchloramphenicolCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseECextracellularEPOerythropoietinErbBproduct of oncogene of avian erythroblastosis virus (receptors in the EGF receptor family)GpAglycophorin AMBPmaltose-binding proteinTMtransmembraneZOIzone of inhibition receptor (ErbB1), ErbB2 (also known as HER2 or the Neu oncogene product), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4) (1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each ErbB receptor has a large extracellular (EC) domain of 600–630 amino acids, a single membrane-spanning α-helix, and an intracellular domain of ∼500 amino acids that contains the tyrosine kinase domain plus regulatory sequences (2Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar). It is now quite well established that activation of ErbB receptors involves their ligand-induced (or ligand-stabilized) oligomerization, which in turn leads to receptor trans-phosphorylation and activation within dimers or higher order oligomers (reviewed in Ref. 3Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar). In the case of ErbB1, we and others have demonstrated that the isolated EC domain of the receptor dimerizes completely upon EGF binding (4Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Lemmon M.A., Bu, Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J.

Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, the isolated EC domain of ErbB4 oligomerizes strongly when it binds to its growth factor ligand neuregulin 1-β1 (4Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These findings have led to the argument that ErbB receptor activation results directly and solely from ligand-induced oligomerization of EC domains (3Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3484) Google Scholar, 11Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 459-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 12Heldin C.-H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). In this view, the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domains of receptor molecules need not contribute directly to receptor oligomerization, but are instead driven together by EC domain interactions in the process of receptor activation.By contrast with this model, Tanner and Kyte (13Tanner K.G. Kyte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35985-35990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have argued that interactions between TM domains do contribute significantly to ErbB1 dimerization. In fact, they go so far as to argue from their data that ErbB1 TM domain interactions provide the primary driving force for receptor dimerization. According to their proposal the unliganded ErbB1 EC domain sterically inhibits TM domain-mediated dimerization of the receptor. Activation of the receptor by EGF is then proposed to occur when ligand binding induces conformational changes in the EC domain that relieve this inhibition and permit TM domain-mediated ErbB1 homodimerization (13Tanner K.G. Kyte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35985-35990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This model was prompted by the finding of Tanner and Kyte (13Tanner K.G. Kyte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35985-35990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that EGF-induced dimerization is far more efficient for a fragment of ErbB1 that contains both the EC domain and the TM domain (when studied in detergent solution) than it is for the EC domain alone. Several other pieces of data also support a role for TM domains in dimerization of bitopic cell-surface receptors. For example, a specific Val → Glu mutation within the TM domain of the Neu oncogene product (ErbB2) is well known to induce ErbB2 dimerization and activation (14Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 15Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 339: 230-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Although precisely how the Val → Glu mutation activates the receptor is not clear, it has been proposed to stabilize interactions between TM α-helices directly (16Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Nature. 1989; 339: 587Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Tzahar et al. (17Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) have also suggested a role for TM domain interactions in ligand-induced ErbB receptor heteromerization. Finally, it was recently shown that the single TM domain from the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor forms oligomers (18Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmuller U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 110-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and that this self-association may play a role in EPO receptor signaling across the membrane (19Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D. Klingmuller U. Curr.

A. 2001; 98: 4379-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).Although recent findings by our laboratory and others argue that EC domains are often sufficient to drive receptor dimerization, this may not always be the case. For example, neuregulin-induced homodimerization of the isolated ErbB3 EC domain cannot be detectedin vitro (4Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D., Hu, S. Ratzkin B. Philo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24604-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligand-induced heteromeric association of ErbB receptors detected in vivocannot be recapitulated using isolated EC domains in vitro(4Ferguson K.M. Darling P.J. Mohan M.J. Macatee T.L. Lemmon M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4632-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 21Horan T. Wen J. Arakawa T. Liu N. Brankow D., Hu, S. Ratzkin B. Philo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24604-24608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Motivated by these observations, together with the reports of receptor TM domain self-association outlined above, we have initiated studies of TM domain interactions in the ErbB receptor family. Using TOXCAT, a system recently developed by the Engelman laboratory for analyzing TM domain interactions in the inner membrane ofEscherichia coli (22Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we find that the TM domains from ErbB receptors homo-oligomerize efficiently. Identification of mutations that disrupt association of ErbB receptor TM domains suggests that the interactions responsible are similar to those that mediate dimerization of the glycophorin A TM α-helix (22Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M.

Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we also find that the Neu mutation destabilizes rather than stabilizes dimerization of the ErbB2 TM domain. Our results support a role for TM domains in stabilizing (possibly ligand-independent) dimerization of ErbB receptors and suggest that the Neu mutation may achieve its effects by altering the nature, rather than extent, of ErbB2 TM domain dimerization.RESULTSTo investigate the ability of ErbB receptor TM domains to self-associate in the plasma membrane of E. coli, we employed the TOXCAT system developed by Russ and Engelman (22Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). This system exploits two properties of the ToxR protein from Vibrio cholerae, namely that it is a specific transcriptional activator that requires dimerization to induce expression from its target promoters and that it is an integral membrane protein with modular structure (26Kolmar H. Hennecke F. Gotze K. Janzer B. Vogt B. Mayer F. Fritz H.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3895-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fusion of the cytoplasmic domain of ToxR (ToxR′) to the strongly dimerizing TM domain from glycophorin A (GpA) (27Bormann B.J. Knowles W.J. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4033-4037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) allows ToxR′ to activate transcription from the ctx promoter (22Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,29Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This finding has been exploited in several studies of TM domain interactions (18Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Kubatzky K.F. Ruan W. Gurezka R. Cohen J. Ketteler R. Watowich S.S. Neumann D. Langosch D.

A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The TM domain of interest is fused between a NH2-terminal cytoplasmic ToxR′ transcriptional activation domain and a periplasmic (assuming correct membrane insertion) MBP domain. Correct membrane insertion of the ToxR′ (TM)MBP chimera can be determined by assessing both its ability to complement an MBP deficiency in mutant E. coli and its accessibility to protease digestion in spheroplasts. TM domain dimerization is assessed in the TOXCAT system by monitoring expression of CAT, which is under control of the ToxR-responsive ctxpromoter on a reporter plasmid.ErbB Receptor TM Domains DimerizeBy assessing the ability of ToxR′ chimerae to activate CAT reporter expression in E. coli we found that each ErbB receptor TM domain homodimerizes significantly, even when compared with the strongly dimerizing GpA TM domain (GpA-TM). The ErbB receptor TM domains homodimerize in the rank order ErbB4-TM > ErbB1-TM ≈ ErbB2-TM > ErbB3-TM. CAT expression in E. coli can be monitored using a disc diffusion assay (see “Experimental Procedures”), in which resistance to CAM around a disc impregnated with this antibiotic is assessed. As shown graphically in Fig. 2 (see also Ref. 22Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), only a small ZOI surrounds a CAM-impregnated disc placed on a plate ofE. coli expressing a dimerizing ToxR′ chimera (ToxR′(GpA-TM)MBP, for example), since these cells are CAM-resistant. The ZOI is much larger when the bacteria express a nondimerizing ToxR′ chimera; either with no TM domain (No TM) or with a nondimerizing TM domain (the G83I mutant of GpA-TM (23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 29: 12719-12725Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar)), since activation of CAT expression is reduced. As shown in Fig. 2, expression of ToxR′ chimerae containing the ErbB1, ErbB2, or ErbB4 TM domains results in ZOI’s similar in size to that seen for GpA-TM, indicating strong TM domain dimerization. A chimera containing the ErbB3 TM domain also appears to confer some CAM resistance, but significantly less than for the other ErbB TM domains or GpA-TM. The ZOI measured for the ErbB3 chimera is only slightly smaller than with the G83I mutant of GpA-TM in which dimerization is severely disrupted (23Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 29: 12719-12725Crossref Scopus (463) Google Scholar).For a more quantitative comparison of TM domain dimerization we next assayed CAT activity directly in lysates of E. coliexpressing the different chimerae, by measuring the transfer of3H acetyl groups to biotinylated CAM (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 3, expression of the ToxR′(GpA-TM)MBP chimera resulted in a high level of CAT activity in E. coli lysates, which was reduced over 12-fold by the G83I mutation that disrupts GpA-TM dimerization. ToxR′ chimerae containing the ErbB1 or ErbB2 TM domains induced approximately half the CAT activity seen for GpA-TM: the ErbB3 TM domain induced slightly less (approximately 40%) and the ErbB4 TM domain more (approximately 70%) activity.Figure 3Quantitative CAT assays of E. coliexpressing ToxR′(ErbB-TM) MBP chimerae. CAT assays were performed on normalized quantities of lysates from E. colithat expressed chimerae with the noted TM domains (see “Experimental Procedures”). At least three independent experiments were performed (in triplicate) for each TM domain, and means are plotted (±S.D.). CAT activities are expressed as the percentage of that seen with the GpA-TM chimera in parallel experiments. Background correction was also applied according to the number of counts (less than 3–5% of the value obtained with GpA-TM) measured in a negative control (pccKAN, with no TM domain).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In control experiments, we demonstrated by Western blotting that expression levels of the ToxR′ chimerae containing ErbB receptor TM domains were essentially identical (Fig.4 A). To demonstrate that the chimerae are correctly integrated into the membrane, each was shown to complement a malE deletion in E. coli, allowing a strain that does not express MBP (MM39) to grow with maltose as its sole carbon source (Fig. 4 B). This can only occur if the MBP moiety of the chimera is present in the periplasm and so provides evidence that the chimera inserts correctly in the plasma membrane: with MBP in the periplasm, ToxR′ sequences in the cytoplasm and the TM domain spanning the inner membrane. Correct membrane integration was further supported by that fact that each chimera was accessible to partial proteinase K digestion in spheroplasts (but not in whole cells), while cytoplasmic proteins were not (representative data are shown in Fig. 5). In these experiments, nearly all of the expressed chimera was accessible to proteinase K in the spheroplast preparation, suggesting that almost all has acquired the correct transmembrane orientation.Figure 4Mutation of ErbB TM domains does not affect expression or membrane insertion of ToxR' chimerae. A, lysates from E. coli expressing the marked chimerae were normalized for protein content, run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and immunoblotted with an antibody to the COOH-terminal MBP domain. All chimerae tested expressed at essentially identical levels, except for the ErbB4 N2/C mutant (which actually showed enhanced apparent dimerization). Results for all mutants that were defective in oligomerization are shown, to confirm that loss of CAT transcription did not simply result from a reduction in the quantity of the transcriptional activator. B, MM39 (malE-deficient) E. coli expressing the indicated chimera were streaked on an M9 minimal media plate with maltose as the sole carbon source. Only cells in which MBP is periplasmic (and therefore in which the chimera is correctly inserted into the membrane) can survive with maltose as sole carbon source. This was true for all TM domain chimerae used in this study, indicating proper membrane integration. As controls, growth of cells expressing periplasmic MBP from pMAL-p2 is shown, as is the lack of growth of cells expressing only cytoplasmic MBP from pMAL-c2 (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5ToxR(ErbB-TM) MBP chimerae are susceptible to protease digestion in spheroplasts but not in whole cells. The accessibility of ToxR′/MBP chimerae to proteinase K digestion in spheroplasts (S) and whole cells (W) was compared. Data from these control experiments are shown here for chimerae containing GpA-TM (A), ErbB2-TM mutated in motifs 2N and 2C (B), wild-type ErbB2-TM (C), and ErbB2-TM containing the Neu Val → Glu mutation (D). Similar data were obtained for all other chimerae discussed in this paper. In each panel, the left-hand gel is a Western blot probed with an anti-MBP antibody, while the right-hand gelis stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor the extent to which proteinase K has proteolyzed E. coli proteins in general. The intact ToxR′(TM)MBP fusion is denoted at the left of each anti-MBP Western blot with an arrow, and MBP that has been liberated from the chimera by proteolysis is denoted with anasterisk. In whole cells (W) there is no cleavage of the chimerae whether the cells are left untreated (U), treated with proteinase K (P) or treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 plus proteinase K (DP). The Coomassie-stained gel on the right of each panel shows no general cleavage ofE. coli proteins. By contrast, while chimerae are not cleaved in spheroplasts (S) that are left untreated (U), substantial cleavage is seen when proteinase K is added (P), despite a lack of general proteolysis in the Coomassie-stained gels. This indicates that the ToxR′(TM)MBP chimerae are accessible to added proteinase K in spheroplasts but not in intactE. coli. Detergent solubilization of spheroplasts followed by proteinase K treatment (labeled DP) results in substantially more general proteolysis of E. coli proteins, but no significant increase in ToxR′(TM)MBP chimera cleavage. This indicates that nearly all of the chimeric protein is accessible to proteinase K in the spheroplast preparation. These results support the data presented in Fig. 4 that the ToxR′(TM)MBP chimerae are correctly integrated into the E. coli inner membrane, with MBP in the periplasm. Molecular mass markers in the Coomassie-stained gels are (from the highest seen) are 201, 130, 94, 48, and 36 kDa (close to the bottom of each gel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Presence of Potential Dimerization Motifs in ErbB Receptor TM DomainsThree primary modes have been described for the strong noncovalent self-association of individual TM domains. In one, a heptad motif of leucines is thought to mediate oligomerization, presumably through side chain packing interactions similar to those seen in leucine zippers (18Gurezka R. Laage R. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9265-9270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The ErbB receptor TM domains contain no such heptad motifs, arguing against the relevance of this type of interaction for our studies. A second mode involves stabilization of TM domain oligomers by intramembraneous hydrogen bonds between polar side chains (32Zhou F.X. Merianos H.J. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2250-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 33Gratkowski H. Lear J.D. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The ErbB receptor TM domains contain no strongly polar side chains, allowing us to dismiss this as a possibility. The third mode, likely to be of most relevance for ErbB receptor TM domains, involves the so called GXXXG motif (30Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The GXXXG motif is a central component of the dimerization interface for the GpA TM domain (28MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H.

Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16155-16159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nearly all dimerizing sequences isolated from a TM domain library in a TOXCAT-based screen contained a sequence related to the GXXXG motif (30Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the GpA-TM dimer have shown that the GXXXG motif increases the total area of the helix-helix interface by allowing close proximity of adjacent straight helices when they cross in a right-handed sense (28MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). In addition, the motif provides a flat surface against which side chains of other interfacial residues may pack.Inspection of the sequences for the ErbB receptor TM domains (Fig. 1) shows several elements that closely resemble the GXXXG motifs found by Russ and Engelman (30Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) to drive TM domain dimerization. These motifs are listed in Table I. Sternberg and Gullick (35Sternberg M.J. Gullick W.J. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) previously pointed out the frequent occurrence of this general pentapeptide motif (P0-P1-P2-P3-P4) in the TM domains of receptor tyrosine kinases, in which the first position (P0) is occupied by a residue with a small side chain (G/A/S/T/P), position P4 is occupied by alanine or glycine, and position P3 is most often occupied by a residue with a large aliphatic side chain. The TM domains from ErbB1, ErbB2, and ErbB4 all possess at least two such potential motifs, one toward the amino terminus and one toward the carboxyl terminus of the domain (separated by ∼3 turns of α-helix). Each motif is designated with the receptor name and respective terminus in Table I (for example, motif 1C is the ErbB1 COOH-terminal motif with sequence AXXXG). In the ErbB1 and ErbB4 TM domains there are two possible NH2-terminal motifs that overlap. These are denoted by the addition of a subscripted “1” or “2” to the motif name. For example, the ErbB1 NH2-terminal TXXXG pattern is motif 1N1, and the overlapping GXXXA pattern is motif 1N2 (see Table I). The ErbB3 TM domain is exceptional in having only one possible motif, a TXXXG sequence (3N), that is positioned similarly to the GXXXG motif in GpA-TM (Fig. 1).Table IPotential GXXXG-based dimerization motifs in the TM domains of ErbB receptorsMotifTM domainResidue 1Residue 2Residue 3Residue 4Residue 5Role in dimerization1N1 (TXXXG)ErbB1Thr648Gly649Met650Val651Gly652No1N2 (GXXXA)ErbB1Gly649Met650Val651Gly652Ala653No1C (AXXXG)ErbB1Ala661Leu662Gly663Ile664Gly665Yes2N (SXXXG)ErbB2Ser656Ala657Val658Val659Gly660Yes2C (GXXXG)ErbB2Gly668Val669Val670Phe671Gly672Yes3N (TXXXG)ErbB3Thr647Val648Ile649Ala650Gly651No4N1 (AXXXG)ErbB4Ala655Gly656Val657Ile658Gly659ND1-aND, not determined.4N2 (GXXXG)ErbB4Gly656Val657Ile658Gly659Gly660Yes4C (GXXXA)ErbB4Gly668Leu669Thr670Phe671Ala672No↑Mutated position1-a ND, not determined.

Here we report that ErbB4, a tyrosine kinase receptor for neuregulins, is a substrate for presenilin-dependent γ-secretase. Our studies show that constitutive ectodomain shedding of full-length ErbB4 yields the ∼80-kDa membrane-associated C-terminal fragment (B4-CTF). Subsequent intramembrane cleavage of the B4-CTF was inhibited in the cells devoid of functional presenilins or by treatment of cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor, leading to enhanced accumulation of B4-CTF. Furthermore, anin vitro γ-secretase assay demonstrated that the intracellular domain of ErbB4 (B4-ICD) was produced and subsequently released into the soluble fraction in a presenilin-dependent manner. We have also shown that ectopically expressed B4-ICD is localized to the nucleus, suggesting that the presenilin-dependent cleavage of ErbB4 generates the soluble B4-ICD that functions in the nucleus presumably at transcriptional level. Our study indicates that ErbB4 represents a first receptor tyrosine kinase that undergoes intramembrane proteolysis and may mediate a novel signaling function independent of its canonical role as a receptor tyrosine kinase.

These observations imply that the presenilins may also be involved in the intramembrane cleavage of other type I membrane proteins.

At 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed using buffer IP (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with buffer HS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) plus protease inhibitor using a 22-gauge needle. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. The samples were then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. Membranes were pelleted from the postnuclear supernatants by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 ×g and resuspended in buffer H (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA) plus protease inhibitors. In vitro B4-ICD and NICD generation experiments were performed by incubating the membrane fractions at 37 °C for the indicated time in a volume of 50 μl as 2.5 mg/ml protein solution. After incubation, the soluble and membrane-associated ErbB4 or Notch fragments were separated by centrifugation of the reaction mixtures at 200,000 × g for 30 min. To identify novel substrates for presenilin-dependent γ-secretase, we conducted proteomic analysis by subcellular fractionation and two-dimensional electrophoresis. To detect the accumulation of novel substrates for γ-secretase, we first treated 293 cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor, Compound E (25Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H. Yang F.

To achieve the enrichment of target transmembrane proteins, we performed subcellular fractionation to isolate membrane proteins using the 293 cells grown in the presence or absence of Compound E (Fig.1 A). Both heavy (P2) and light (P3) membrane fractions were extracted with carbonate (100 mm Na2CO3 at pH11) to remove peripherally attached membrane proteins (Fig. 1 A). Under these conditions, C-terminal fragments of APP (C83/99), known γ-secretase substrates, substantially accumulated in all γ-secretase-treated cells (Fig. 1 B). The remaining integral membrane proteins (CP2 and CP3) were further analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (Fig. 1 C) (data not shown for CP2). Less than 1% of total identified spots in two-dimensional gels accumulated in substantially higher levels in γ-secretase-treated cells as compared with control cells. Based on the molecular size of protein spots detected and selectively present in the inhibitor-treated cells, we selected several type I membrane candidate substrates. The following criteria were used to select the candidate substrates for further verification and analyses: (i) size of the predicted intracellular domain; (ii) phorbol ester-enhanced or metalloprotease-mediated ectodomain shedding; (iii) presence of extracellular dimerization motif. One of these candidates was ErbB4, a type I membrane receptor tyrosine kinase (26Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The accumulation of ErbB4 C-terminal fragments was dramatically elevated in dAsp cells whereas the levels of full-length form were virtually unaffected (Fig. 2 B). As for the case in APP, the enhanced accumulation of B4-CTF was likely due to the increased stability. This may be attributed to the deficient γ-secretase activity rather than increased ectodomain shedding, because the secretion of the extracellular domain was not significantly affected in dAsp cells as compared with dW cells (data not shown). Next we investigated if a γ-secretase inhibitor blocks the putative transmembrane cleavage of ErbB4 to cause an accumulation of B4-CTF similar to that observed in dAsp cells.

Our studies suggest that constitutive ectodomain shedding of full-length ErbB4 yields the ∼80-kDa membrane-associated B4-CTF, and the subsequent intramembrane cleavage of the B4-CTF was inhibited in cells devoid of functional presenilins or by treatment of cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor, leading to enhanced accumulation of B4-CTF. To directly assess the intramembrane cleavage of ErbB4 without stimulation with ligand, we expressed constructs encoding the truncated ErbB4 lacking the majority of entire extracellular regions (Fig.4 A). To trace the precursor and product upon cleavage, the truncated construct (ΔE2) encoded a polypeptide containing an HA epitope tag located immediately after the signal peptide in addition to the C-terminal V5 and 6xHis tags (Fig.4 A). ErbB4 constructs encoding extracellular 79 amino acids (ΔE2, Fig. 4 A) were found to undergo proteolytic processing in the absence of the majority of the extracellular domain, yielding C-terminal fragments that are similar to the fragment generated from full-length ErbB4. Increased accumulation of these fragments (indicated by the asterisk in Fig. 4 B) in dAsp indicates that these fragments represent a direct substrate for γ-secretase cleavage. Alignment of transmembrane amino acid sequences revealed that ErbB4 has a conserved valine residue, which is topologically similar with the γ-secretase cleavage site in Notch (Fig. 4 A (15Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar)). Recent studies demonstrated that APP also undergoes a similar cleavage, which is reminiscent of the S3 cleavage of Notch at the conserved valine residue (at site 49 of the Aβ), in addition to the expected γ-secretase cleavage (at sites 40 and 42) (17Gu Y.

To directly demonstrate the γ-secretase-like cleavage of ErbB4 and the subsequent release of soluble intracellular domains of ErbB4 (B4-ICD), we performed in vitro γ-CTF (e.g. B4-ICD) generation experiments (17Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 18Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A.

Incubation of the cytosol-free membrane fractions prepared from dW cells transfected with ErbB4-ΔE2 constructs (Fig. 3 A) led to the release of V5-epitope-tagged B4-ICD into the soluble fraction (Fig. 4 C). The release of B4-ICD was increased in a time-dependent manner in dW cells, whereas inhibition occurred in both membrane fractions from dAsp cells and dW cells incubated with Compound E (Fig. 4 C), indicating that presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage is responsible for the release of B4-ICD. In our system, Notch intracellular domain (NICD) was also generated in a γ-secretase inhibitor-sensitive manner when the membrane fractions were prepared from dW cells transfected with the Notch-ΔE construct (Fig.4 D (15Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar)). To gain insight into the biological functions of the B4-ICD produced by presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage, we then examine its subcellular localization. We determined the subcellular localization of B4-ICD by expressing either GFP alone or an N-terminal GFP-tagged version of ErbB4 containing the entire intracellular domain (GFP-B4ICD; Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, GFP was distributed both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the GFP-B4ICD was located predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 5). Deletion of the entire tyrosine kinase domain did not affect the nuclear localization. 3Y. Z. Huang and L. Mei, unpublished data. These results suggest that the B4-ICD may play an unique role in cell signaling in addition to the canonical pathway mediated by the tyrosine kinase activation. This observation is consistent with what has been reported for APP and Notch intracellular domains (AICD and NICD, respectively), because ectopically expressed AICD and NICD localize to the nucleus (13Struhl G.

The signaling specificity may be determined by a set of genes that are selectively activated (or inactivated) by each ICD. Although further experiments are necessary to clearly define the role of the nuclear targeting of B4-ICD, it is interesting to note that nuclear localization of ErbB4 and other ErbB family proteins have previously been described in vivo and in vitro(34Lin S.-Y.

For instance, the immunoreactivity of EGF receptor cytoplasmic domain was found in the nucleus, and the occurrence of the nuclear EGFR in highly invasive cancer cell lines was increased (34Lin S.-Y. Makino K. Xia W. Martin A. Wen Y. Kwong K.Y. Bourguignon L. Hungm M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The nuclear ErbB4 immunoreactivity has also been observed in many cancer cell lines (35Srinivasan R. Gillett C.E. Barnes D.M. Gullick W.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1483-1487PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in cultured primary neurons.3 Our preliminary studies showed that overexpression of truncated ErbB4 inhibited cell growth, raising the possibility that nuclear localization of ErbB4 ICDs may play a role in cell growth and proliferation. These observations further imply that the proteolytic generation of B4-ICD or other ICD, such as B1-, B2-, and B3-ICD, might modulate cell growth and proliferation of normal and cancer cells. These studies demonstrated that the ectodomain shedding of ErbB4 yields the ∼80-kDa membrane-tethered B4-CTF, which serves as a substrate for the presenilin-dependent γ-secretase-like transmembrane cleavage. The subsequent intramembrane cleavage of ErbB4 requires functional presenilins and can be blocked by γ-secretase inhibitorin vitro as well as in intact cells. In addition, ectopically expressed B4-ICD was localized to the nucleus. These results suggest that the presenilin-dependent intramembrane cleavage of ErbB4 may mediate a novel signaling function from the cell surface receptor to the nucleus independent of its canonical role as a receptor tyrosine kinase (1Junttila T.T. Sundvall M. Maatta J.A. Elenius K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Buonanno A. Fischbach G.D. Curr. Opin.

Further, export of the product, S1P, from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space was not observed (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J.

Although platelets and mast cells are known to secrete S1P, it is unclear whether other cells that express SK are capable of secreting S1P (21Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A.

Thus, the mechanisms by which S1P is secreted to interact with the GPCRs on the plasma membrane remain unclear (24English D. Welch Z. Kovala A.T. Harvey K. Volpert O.V. Brindley D.N. Garcia J.G. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is of interest that the extracellular face of the plasma membrane is a site of metabolism of sphingomyelin. The substrate, sphingomyelin, is enriched in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, particularly in specialized microdomains such as caveolae (25Dobrowsky R.T. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelinases are secreted by cells; for example, human endothelial cells secrete secretory isoforms of sphingomyelinases when stimulated by inflammatory cytokines (26Marathe S. Schissel S.L.

Moreover, ceramidase enzyme was secreted from endothelial cells as well (27Romiti E. Meacci E. Tani M. Nuti F. Farnararo M. Ito M. Bruni P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane is an active site of generation of sphingolipid mediators. Interestingly, lysolipid phosphate phosphatases are known to be oriented with the active site found in the extracellular space (28Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Indeed, a recently cloned S1P phosphatase also possesses a similar structure, suggesting that S1P degradation may also occur on the outer phase of the plasma membrane (30Mandala S.M. Thornton R.

It is not known whether SK is found in the extracellular milieu, as a potential mechanism of generation of extracellular S1P. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism of S1P generation in the extracellular milieu, which occurs because of the export of the SK-1 enzyme.

Poly(A)+ RNA from Swiss 3T3 cells (ATCC CCL-92) was used to amplify the murine SK-1 cDNA by the reverse transcription-PCR procedure with the sense primer GAC CTG GCT ATG GAA CCA GAA TGC and the antisense primer AAA GGC ACA GAG TTA TGG TTC TTC TGG. The resulting PCR product was cloned in pcDNA3.1Topo vector (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequence was confirmed. SK-1 cDNA was then cloned in phase with a C-terminal V5-His tag in the V5-His-pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen). Samples were supplemented with 2.5 volumes of chloroform/1-butanol/HCl (50/50/1 v/v), vortexed for 2 min, and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were spun at 5,000 × g for 10 min. Organic phases were dried under nitrogen and analyzed by TLC. This single step extraction allowed the extraction of S1P with an efficiency of >90% recovery when monitored with the tracer [3H]S1P. 2N. Ancellin and T. Hla, unpublished observation. Cells were washed three times with plain medium (M199 for HUVEC or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for HEK293) supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-stripped lipid depleted FBS and incubated with 1 ml of the same medium for the times indicated. After incubation, conditioned medium was removed, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and used for the SK activity assay. Cells were scraped at 4 °C with 400 μl of 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and disrupted by sonication on ice using two 10-s bursts (sonic dismembrator 60, Fisher Scientific). Cellular homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min, 4 °C at 20,000 × g, and protein concentration of the crude cell extract was quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). SK activity was determined as described below. Triton X-100 5% (v/v) was used to prepare a stock solution of 2.5 mm sphingosine. 400 μl of conditioned medium was supplemented to achieve a final concentration of 20 μm sphingosine, 500 μm[32P]ATP (10 μCi), 5 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaF, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Lipids were extracted, and samples were resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform. [32P]S1P was resolved by TLC on Silica Gel G60 using 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (60/20/20 v/v) buffer and quantified with a PhosphorImager. Bands corresponding to S1P were also scraped from the plates and counted in a scintillation counter. The intracellular SK activity was obtained using the same assay with 100 μl of crude cell extract (10 μg of protein) complemented with 300 μl of M199 (HUVEC) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HEK293). Cells cultured in 35-mm plates were washed three times with plain medium and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with 1 ml of 1% charcoal-stripped lipid-depleted FBS medium. Then medium was supplemented with 25 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mmNaF, 0.25 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, with 25 μCi of [32P]ATP, and when indicated 1 μm sphingosine and/or 500 μmATP. Lipids were extracted from the medium by 2.5 volumes of chloroform/1-butanol/HCl (50/50/1 v/v) and dried under nitrogen. Cells were incubated with 2 ml of chloroform/1-butanol/HCl (50/50/1 v/v) to extract S1P. Lipids were resolve by TLC as described. HUVEC were incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free M199 and 10% FBS. Cells were then incubated with 200 μCi of 32Pi for 2 h and then supplemented with 1 μm sphingosine, 2 h at 37 °C. Lipids from medium and cells were extracted as described above. Lipids were subjected to a mild alkaline methanolysis (methanolic KOH at 37 °C, 2 h) and extracted again with 2.5 volumes of chloroform/1-butanol/HCl (50/50/1 v/v). Samples were resolved by TLC as described above. The S1P3/EDG-3 GPCR expression in Xenopus oocytes was performed as described previously (32Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18997-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic calcium mobilization was detected as light emission generated by the photoprotein aequorin (33Ancellin N. Morel A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, after injection of 20 nl of 1 mg/ml aequorin, oocytes were placed individually in a 3-ml vial containing 270 μl of OR2 buffer (5 mm HEPES pH 7.8, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) and 0.05% ffa-BSA. Light emission was detected by a luminometer (Turner Design). Results are expressed as relative light units. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with oocytes from different frogs. S1P extracted from conditioned medium or cells was resuspended overnight at 4 °C in OR2 buffer pH 8.5 supplemented with 0.4% ffa-BSA. The equivalent of 1 ml of medium was resuspended in a final volume of 200 μl of OR2 and 0.4% ffa-BSA, pH 8.5, and 30 μl was used to challenge an aequorin-loaded S1P3/EDG-3-expressing oocyte in 270 μl of OR2 and 0.05% ffa-BSA. Controls were performed on wild type aequorin-loaded oocytes. Cell viability was assayed by the trypan blue exclusion method. HUVEC were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% Trypan blue. Unstained (viable) and stained (dead) cells were counted using a hematocytometer. Fewer than 1% of HUVEC stained after a 4-h incubation in M199 0.5% charcoal-stripped lipid-depleted FBS. A cytotoxicity test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the cytotoxicity detection kit (lactate dehydrogenase) (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Results are represented as optical density at 492 nm. Inhibition of SK expression in HUVEC was performed essentially as described using SK-1-specific siRNA reagents (34Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8154) Google Scholar) (http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html). Human SK-1-specific 21-nucleotide siRNAs (Dharmacon Research) (GAGCUGCAAGGCCUUGCCCdTdT and GGGCAAGGCCUUGCAGCUCdTdT) were targeted 70 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. HUVEC were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, cells and conditioned media were subjected to SK and lactate dehydrogenase activity assay. In some experiments, mRNA was extracted, and reverse transcription-PCR for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and SK-1 was performed essentially as described (35Hla T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9308-9313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V5-tagged SK-1 transfected HEK293 cells grown on 10 cm dish were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 2 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2. The medium was removed and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. Conditioned medium was adjusted to 80 mm dithiothreitol, loaded on Centricon 10 (Amicon Bioseparations, Millipore), and centrifuged at 5,000 × g, 3.5 h, 6 °C. Cells were scraped in 50 mm HEPES buffer pH 7.0 supplemented with protease inhibitors (1× mixture, Calbiochem) and sonicated on ice. Cellular homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, 4 °C. The protein concentrations of cell extracts were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Cell homogenates corresponding to 1% of total cell extract and concentrated medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-V5 antibody (1:7000, Invitrogen) or β-Actin antibody (1:2500, Sigma) or anti p38 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz). Three μg of poly(A)+ RNA from HUVEC, HEK293, or SK-transfected HEK293 cells was used, and Northern analysis was conducted as described previously (11Lee M.J. Thangada S. Claffey K.P. Ancellin N.

Mouse SK-1 cDNA was blunt end cloned into the EcoRV site of pAvS6alx (adenoviral shuttle plasmid containing the lox recombination site) to create pAvlxsphk1 (31Gorziglia M.I. Kadan M.J. Yei S. Lim J. Lee G.M. Luthra R. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA was then sequenced. The sphk1 cDNA was incorporated into an adenoviral vector using the lox recombination three-plasmid transfection system (31Gorziglia M.I. Kadan M.J. Yei S. Lim J. Lee G.M. Luthra R. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections of the S8 cells were performed with 0.5 μg ofNotI-digested pAvlxsphk1, 0.5 μg of pCcre, and 1 μg ofClaI-digested pSQ3 DNA using the LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent system (Invitrogen). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for ∼5–7 days. At that time the conditioned medium and cells were collected, frozen and thawed three times, and the cell debris was pelleted. The conditioned medium was then used to infect a fresh plate of dexamethasone-induced S8 cells. A cytopathic effect was observed in the cells ∼12–15 days post-transfection. The virus was amplified in 15-cm dishes of dexamethazone-induced S8 cells and purified by CsCl banding procedures (31Gorziglia M.I. Kadan M.J. Yei S. Lim J. Lee G.M. Luthra R. Trapnell B.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4173-4178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Matrigel plugs were dissected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 2 h at 4 °C. The tissue was then processed and embedded in paraffin. Five-μm thick paraffin sections were cut. Three sections, at least 50 μm apart, were stained with anti-smooth muscle α-actin monoclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego) and standard immunoperoxidase detection (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Positively stained cells were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidene (Sigma), and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Matrigel plugs were snap frozen in a dry ice/alcohol bath and dried overnight. The dry weight was recorded, and the plug was rehydrated with 0.5 ml of 0.5% Tween 20 and water. After homogenization, the plug was centrifuged at 14,000 × rpm for 30 min. Supernatant fluid was collected, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm and converted to μg of hemoglobin/mg of Matrigel using a standard curve generated with hemoglobin standards. We developed a sensitive bioassay to quantify S1P using theXenopus oocytes expressing the S1P3/EDG-3 polypeptide, a Gq-coupled S1P receptor (32Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18997-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In this system, S1P/EDG-3 interaction results in rises in intracellular calcium, which are then quantified by the measurement of luminescence emitted by the photoprotein aequorin. Aequorin-loaded, S1P3/EDG-3-expressing oocytes detected concentrations of S1P as low as 0.1 nm (30 fmol of S1P) (Fig.1 A). We showed previously that sphingosine did not stimulate the S1P3/EDG-3 receptor, even at high (μm) concentrations (32Ancellin N. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18997-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Lipid extracts from the conditioned medium of HUVEC stimulated S1P3/EDG-3-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1 B) but failed to stimulate wild type oocytes (data not shown). The level of S1P was estimated to be in the low nm range. Incubation of endothelial cells with sphingosine led to a concomitant increase of S1P in the medium, suggesting that active SK is present in the system. As expected, cytosol of HUVEC contained higher levels of S1P (Fig. 1 C), which was increased further by the addition of sphingosine to the medium. The total amount of S1P contained in medium of HUVEC after 45 min of incubation was ∼300 fmol/ml (0.3 ± 0.09 nm). The addition of sphingosine (250 nm and 1 μm) increased S1P levels to 800 ± 215 and 1,200 ± 495 fmol, respectively. These data suggest that endothelial cells are capable of converting exogenous sphingosine to S1P and that measurable levels of S1P are found in the extracellular medium. S1P in the conditioned medium may be generated intracellularly and transported out of the cell, or it may be produced extracellularly by an extracellular SK. To address this question, we labeled HUVEC with32Pi, incubated with the substrate sphingosine, extracted and quantified the lipids from the medium or from the cells by TLC and autoradiography. Consistent with published reports (20Olivera A. Kohama T. Edsall L. Nava V. Cuvillier O. Poulton S. Spiegel S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 545-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), the majority of the [32P]S1P was generated intracellularly, and a very small amount (<0.05%) was found in the medium (Fig.2 A). Moreover, no S1P was detected in the medium in the absence of sphingosine (data not shown). This suggests that intracellularly formed S1P is not exported out of the endothelial cells under our experimental conditions. Because 32Pi labeling generates mainly [32P]ATP intracellularly, we used a cell surface kinase assay, in which [32P]ATP was provided extracellularly. HUVEC were incubated with 25 μCi of [32P]ATP (4.1 nm) and sphingosine (1 μm) or not for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 2 B, S1P was produced only when sphingosine was present. Importantly, most of [32P]S1P produced by HUVEC during this assay was found in the medium. This suggests that action of SK formed [32P]S1P in the extracellular compartment exclusively. Next we tested whether SK activity accumulates in the medium of endothelial cells. Although the medium by itself does not contain any SK activity, contact with HUVEC resulted in a time-dependent increase of SK activity (Fig.2 C). After 4 h of incubation, HUVEC-conditioned medium contained 6.1 pmol/min/106 cells SK activity (Fig.2 D). Similar experiments conducted in complete growth medium (+ FBS + endothelial cell growth factor + heparin) gave similar results (data not shown). Intracellular kinase activity was 73.9 pmol/min/106 cells after 45 min and decreased slightly during the time course of the experiment (data not shown). SK activity was measured in the linear range of activity (data not shown). These data suggest that in HUVEC, SK activity is exported into the extracellular medium. Treatment of HUVEC with various cytokines, growth factors, and other endothelial activators did not stimulate or inhibit the export of SK activity. Specifically, treatment with 10 ng/ml FGF-2, 50 ng/ml vascular endothelial growth factor, 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, 50 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor, or 50 nm S1P for 2 h did not stimulate or inhibit the release of SK activity (data not shown). These data suggest that export of SK in HUVEC is not modulated by endothelial cell activation by these vasoactive factors. Similarly, activation of protein kinase C by 500 nm phorbol ester or inhibiti"

The green fluorescent Cl−-sensitive chromophore 10,10′-bis[3-carboxypropyl]-9,9′-biacridinium dinitrate (BAC) was conjugated to aminodextran together with the red fluorescent Cl−-insensitive chromophore tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). BAC fluorescence is pH-insensitive and quenched by Cl−with a Stern-Volmer constant of 36 m−1. Endosomes in J774 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were pulse-labeled with BAC-TMR-dextran by fluid-phase endocytosis. Endosomal [Cl−] increased over 45 min from 17 to 53 mm in J774 cells and from 28 to 73 mm in CHO cells, during which time endosomal pH decreased from 6.95 to 5.30 (J774) and 6.92 to 5.60 (CHO). The acidification and increased [Cl−] were blocked by bafilomycin. Together with ion substitution and buffer capacity measurements, we conclude that Cl− transport accounts quantitatively for the electrical shunt during vacuolar acidification. Measurements of relative endosomal volume by a novel ratio imaging method involving fluorescence self-quenching indicated a 2.5-fold increase in volume during early acidification and Cl− accumulation, which was blocked by bafilomycin. These experiments provide the first direct measurement of endosomal [Cl−] and indicate that endosomal acidification is accompanied by significant Cl− entry and volume increase.

These experiments provide the first direct measurement of endosomal [Cl−] and indicate that endosomal acidification is accompanied by significant Cl− entry and volume increase. Progressive acidification of vesicles in the endosomal pathway is important for receptor and ligand sorting and vesicular fusion (1Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar, 2Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Endosomal acidification is driven by a vacuolar-type H+pump that is present in the endosomal-limiting membrane. To maintain electroneutrality, H+ entry into the endosomal aqueous lumen must be accompanied by anion entry and/or cation exit. The principal transportable intracellular anion is Cl− and cation is K+. Studies of organellar pH in living cells and isolated vesicles have provided evidence that Cl− entry may be the rate-limiting passive conductance in permitting active H+ entry in endosomes (3Van Dyke R.W.

In isolated endocytic vesicles from kidney proximal tubule (10Bae H.R. Verkman A.S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20590-20593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protein kinase A-activated Cl− conductance was characterized, and it was proposed that activation of Cl− channels might regulate endosomal acidification by providing a shunt to dissipate the interior-positive potential produce by the H+ pump. There is also evidence that Na+/K+ pump activity in early endosomes may alter the driving force for H+ entry and thus regulate acidification (12Cain C.C. Sipe D.M. Murphy R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although measurements of endosomal pH have been reported utilizing ratioable pH-sensitive fluorescent indicators (19Geisow M.J. Evans W.H. Exp.

A. 1995; 92: 3156-3160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), there have been no measurements of ion concentrations in the endosomal lumen. Physico-chemical considerations indicate that endosomal [Cl−] and pH should depend on the activity of the vacuolar H+ pump, the magnitude of endosomal cation (K+, Na+, and H+) and anion (Cl− and HCO3−) conductances, endosomal membrane potential, buffer capacity, Donnan potential, and cytoplasmic pH and ion concentrations. Although attempts have been made to model endosomal/organelle acidification mathematically (23Rybak S.L. Lanni F. Murphy R.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 674-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), the paucity of information about key endosomal parameters precludes meaningful predictions about endosomal regulatory processes. Taken in reference to endosomal pH and cytoplasmic pH/[Cl−], endosomal [Cl−] is a particularly important parameter because of its implications for relative endosomal ion conductances and membrane potential. If Cl− conductance is the rate-limiting ion conductance in endosomal acidification, then the interior-positive endosomal electrical potential should produce marked Cl− accumulation in the endosomal aqueous lumen during acidification. The purpose of this study is to develop and apply methodology to measure endosomal [Cl−] quantitatively in living cells. For these measurements, we synthesized a ratioable long wavelength fluorescent Cl− indicator that is brightly fluorescent, pH-insensitive, sensitive to [Cl−] from 0 to >100 mm, biochemically stable, and membrane-impermeant. The endosomal aqueous lumen in cultured cells was stained with Cl− and pH indicators by fluid-phase endocytosis, and the kinetics of endosomal [Cl−] and pH were measured by ratio image analysis. Pulse labeling, inhibitor addition, and ion substitution maneuvers established quantitatively the role of Cl− conductance in endosomal acidification. An unexpectedly low [Cl−] early after endocytosis led us to postulate that endosomal volume increases substantially during acidification, which was supported experimentally using a novel ratio imaging strategy to measure relative endosomal volume.

Ed. 1985; 23: 1307-1319Crossref Google Scholar) (2.8 g, 10 mmol) in acetone (80 ml) was added zinc dust (13.3 g, 201 gram atom). The mixture was stirred for 20 min at 30–40 °C. The flask was cooled in ice-cold water, and 37% HCl (121 g, 1226 mmol) was added dropwise over 4 h under inert atmosphere at 10 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, and 50 ml of degassed water was added. A bright yellow precipitate was collected by suction filtration, rinsed with water, and dissolved in 50 ml of a 5% aqueous NaOH. The mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was neutralized with acetic acid to give a bright yellow precipitate. The precipitate was filtered, washed with water, dried, and recrystallized from hot ethanol to yield 4.39 g (83%) of 10,10′-bis[3-carboxypropyl]-9,9′-biacridylidene (compound2) as a yellow crystalline solid. A suspension of compound 2 (5.3 g, 10 mmol) in 2n nitric acid (250 ml) was heated for 1 h at 120 °C until most of the brownish mass was dissolved. After cooling and filtration, the precipitate was washed with dilute nitric acid, dried, and recrystallized from dilute nitric acid to yield 4.81 g (74%) of compound 3 as a yellow crystalline solid (absorption maximum, 435 nm; molar extinction coefficient (ε), 12,500 cm−1m−1; quantum yield, 0.48).1H NMR (400 MHz, Me2SO-d6): δ 2.80–3.90 (m, 10H, alkyl CH2 and COOH), 5.58 (t, 4H, N-CH2,J = 6.3 Hz), 7.64 (broad singlet, 4H, aromatic), 7.71 (t, 4H, aromatic, J = 6.0 Hz), 8.45 (t, 4H, aromatic,J = 8.8 Hz), and 9.04 (d, 4H, aromatic,J = 9.2 Hz). A solution of compound 3 (3.27 g, 5 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (90 ml) was reacted withN-hydroxysuccinimide (1.56 g, 13.6 mmol) andN,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (2.48 g, 12.05 mmol) at room temperature for 24 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with acetonitrile (15 ml) and stirred for 1 h, and the solid was removed by suction filtration. After washing in acetonitrile the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the concentrate was added dropwise into a rapidly stirred mixture of ethyl acetate/hexane (3:1, 500 ml). The yellow precipitate was collected by suction filtration, and the filtrate was rinsed with ethyl acetate/hexane (3:1, 50 ml). The product was further purified by dissolving in N,N-dimethylformamide and precipitating in ethyl acetate/hexane to yield 2.93 g (69%) of compound4 as a yellow solid (melting point, 214–216 °C).1H NMR (400 MHz, Me2SO-d6): δ 2.60–2.90 (m, 16H, alkyl CH2 and succinimidyl CH2), 5.62 (t, 4H, N-CH2, J = 6.3 Hz), 7.68 (broad singlet, 4H, aromatic), 7.76 (t, 4H, aromatic, J = 6.8 Hz), 8.49 (t, 4H, aromatic, J = 8.4 Hz), and 9.07 (d, 4H, aromatic, J = 9.7 Hz). For synthesis of TMR-dextran, 5-(and 6-)-carboxytetramethyl rhodamine succinimidyl ester (26.4 mg, 0.05 mmol) was stirred with amino dextran (1.0 g, 0.025 mmol,M r 40,000) in aqueous NaHCO3 (25 ml, 0.1 m, pH 8.3–8.5) at room temperature for 2 h. The dextran conjugate was purified by dialysis (25,000-Da cut-off) for 24 h against 0.1 m NaHCO3 and then against water for 36 h at 4 °C. The TMR-dextran was lyophilized (molar labeling ratio TMR/dextran, 1.08:1). For synthesis of BAC-TMR-dextran, TMR-dextran (0.5 g, 0.0125 mmol) was reacted with compound 4(0.25 g, 0.295 mmol) in aqueous NaHCO3 (50 ml, 0.1m, pH 8.3–8.5) at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction mixture was worked up as above to yield 0.46 g of BAC-TMR-dextran (92% with respect to dextran); molar labeling ratio biacridinium/TMR/dextran, 6.68:1.08:1. Fluorescence spectra, molar extinction coefficient, and quantum yield were measured by standard procedures using a Fluoromax-3 fluorimeter. Fluorescence quenching measurements were carried out at peak excitation and emission wavelengths. Microliter aliquots of NaCl (1 m stock) were added to 3 ml of compound (10 μm in 5 mmNa2HPO4-NaH2PO4) at pH 7.4. Stern-Volmer constants (K sv) were calculated from the slope of F0/F − 1versus [Cl−] plots (F0/F − 1) = K sv [Cl−] where F0 is BAC fluorescence in the absence of Cl−and F in the presence of Cl−. Endosomes were labeled by incubation of cells on coverslips with BAC-TMR-dextran (18 mg/ml) or CF-TMR-dextran (3.5 mg/ml) for 2 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmNa2HPO4-NaH2PO4) at 37 °C. Coverslips were then washed five times in ice-cold PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and mounted in a custom-built perfusion chamber maintained at 37 °C in a PDMI-2 microincubator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). Cells were generally perfused with PBS. In some experiments the perfusate contained bafilomycin A1 (200 nm) or NH4Cl (5 or 10 mm). For Cl−-free experiments buffer Cl− was replaced by NO3−. For in vivo Cl− calibrations (BAC/TMR fluorescence ratio versus [Cl−]), perfusate and endosomal [Cl−] were equalized by incubation of cells for up to 1 h at 37 °C in 120 mmKCl/KNO3, 20 mm NaCl/NaNO3, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4, with [Cl−] from 0–100 mm (NO3− replacing Cl−). Solutions contained the ionophores nigericin (10 μm), valinomycin (10 μm), CCCP (5 μm), monensin (10 μm), and the H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin (200 nm). Forin vivo pH calibrations (TMR/CF fluorescence ratioversus pH) cells were incubated with 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, 120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, and the ionophore/bafilomycin mixture with pH adjusted to 4.5–8.0 (in 0.5-pH unit intervals) (21Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic pH was measured using BCECF by excitation ratio imaging (440 and 490 nm) (26Rink T.J. Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Cytosolic [Cl−] was measured using SPQ as described previously (27Chao A.C. Dix J.A. Sellers M.C. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 1071-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). After fluid-phase pulse labeling (2 min) with BAC-TMR-dextran or CF-TMR-dextran and washing, the cells were perfused briefly with ice-cold PBS in the perfusion chamber and then with PBS at 37 °C. Sets of BAC and TMR images (for Cl−) or CF and TMR images (for pH) were acquired at specified times (generally 0, 5, 15, 30, and 45 min). In some experiments bafilomycin (200 nm) was added to the perfusate from the beginning of the experiment or 45 min after pulse labeling. Buffer capacity (β) was determined from the rapid increase in endosomal pH in response to addition of 5 mmNH4Cl to the perfusate (5 mm NH4Cl, 130 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES pH 7.4). β was computed from the equation: β = ([NH4Cl]/ΔpH)·10(pH(out) − pH(final)), where ΔpH is the pH increase just after NH4Cl addition, pHout is perfusate pH, and pHfinal is endosomal pH after NH4Cl addition (28Roos A. Walter W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar, 29Gekle M. Silbernagl S. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Endosomes were pulse-labeled with the mixture of calcein (at self-quenching concentration, 30 mm) and sulforhodamine 101 (at low concentration, 2 mm) in PBS (adjusted to 290 mosM) for 1 min followed by washing with ice-cold PBS. The coverslip was transferred to the perfusion chamber as described above. A series of calcein (green) and sulforhodamine 101 (red) images were obtained at specified times. Endosome expansion produced increased calcein fluorescence because of volume dilution without change in sulforhodamine 101 fluorescence. In some experiments bafilomycin (200 nm) was added to the perfusate. An in vitrocalibration of green-to-red fluorescence versus dilution factor curve was obtained by collecting sets of images of thin films (sandwiched between coverslips and glass slides) of PBS containing calcein (30 mm) and sulforhodamine 101 (2 mm) after specified dilutions with PBS. Experiments were carried out using a Leitz upright fluorescence microscope equipped with a coaxial-confocal attachment (Technical Instruments, San Francisco, CA) and a 14-bit cooled (−30 °C) CCD camera (Photometrics) with a Tektronix back-thinned detector as described previously (19Geisow M.J. Evans W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 150: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cell fluorescence was viewed with a ×100 oil immersion objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 (Plan-apo, working distance 0.17 mm, Nikon, Garden City, NY). The light source was a stabilized Hg-Xe arc lamp (100 watt) lamp attenuated 5–50-fold using neutral density filters. Cells were identified by transillumination using dim red light (to avoid photobleaching), and focus was adjusted. Images (500-ms acquisition time) were obtained using appropriate filter sets for the BAC, TMR, CF, calcein, sulforhodamine 101, and BCECF chromophores. Electronic shutters (Uniblitz, model D122, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NJ) in the illumination and detection paths minimized sample illumination. Custom filter sets (Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) were used for detection of BAC fluorescence (excitation, 470 ± 5 nm; dichroic, 505 nm; emission, 535 ± 20 nm) and TMR fluorescence (excitation, 546 ± 5 nm; dichroic, 565 nm; emission, 590-nm cut-on). Serial image acquisitions indicated 1–3% BAC photobleaching per image acquisition and <1% photobleaching for other chromophores. In time course studies endosomes in different cells were imaged for different time points. Custom software was written in Labview to compute area-integrated background-subtracted pixel intensities. In each TMR (red) image, four regions of cells containing well demarcated endosomes were identified by rectangular boxes, and for each region four nearby regions outside of the endosome/cell were identified for background computation. The same regions were automatically identified in the BAC (green) image and displaced slightly if necessary because of chromatic effects or slight sample movement. The average background was computed for each selected endosome region from the per-pixel intensity of the three lowest of the four selected background regions. After background subtraction, red-to-green (R/G) intensity ratios were computed from area-integrated intensities in each image. Three pairs of images were analyzed for each time point. The same analysis routine was used with CF-TMR images for pH measurements. Calcein/sulforhodamine images for relative volume measurements were analyzed by measuring area-integrated pixel intensities over individual endosomes in green (calcein) and red (sulforhodamine) images. Background values were taken from three areas without endosomes within the analyzed cell. Ratios were calculated for four endosomes in each image pair, and at least two image pairs were analyzed per time point. The ratioable fluorescent Cl− indicator BAC-TMR-dextran (Fig.1 A, compound5) was synthesized by covalently linking the chloride-sensitive chromophore BAC (synthesized in five steps from 9(10H) acridon and γ-butyrolactone) and the Cl−-insensitive chromophore TMR to amino dextran (reaction scheme shown in Fig. 1 A). BAC fluorescence was sensitive to Cl− in the range 0 to >120 mm with a Stern-Volmer quenching constant of 36 m−1(Fig. 1 B, left). BAC fluorescence was insensitive to pH in the range appropriate for cellular measurements (Fig.1 B, top right) and insensitive to cations, non-halide anions (nitrate, phosphate, bicarbonate, and sulfate), and albumin. The green-fluorescing BAC chromophore has fluorescence excitation maxima at 365 and 434 nm and a broad emission spectrum with peak at 505 nm (Fig. 1 B, bottom right). The red-fluorescing TMR chromophore is not sensitive to pH or ion concentrations so that the ratio of red TMR fluorescence to green BAC fluorescence gives [Cl−]. Fig.2 A shows fluorescence emission spectra of BAC-TMR-dextran, indicating the Cl−-sensitive green BAC fluorescence and the Cl−-insensitive red TMR fluorescence. For cell studies, two cell lines with different properties were used (J774 macrophages and CHO cells). Fig.2 B (left) shows a calibration of BAC-TMR-dextran red-to-green fluorescence ratio (R/G) versus[Cl−] in aqueous solution (filled circles) and J774 cells (open circles). Cl− was replaced by nitrate in the solution measurement. For cell measurements, endosomes were labeled by fluid-phase endocytosis with a 2-min incubation with BAC-TMR dextran in saline. Representative cell images are shown in Fig. 2 B (right). As found in previous studies (20–32), endosomes were seen as distinct bright spots on a dark background. The fluorescent spots became larger with increasing chase time, corresponding to progression from early endosomes to multivesicular bodies to lysosomes. The red TMR fluorescence seen in Fig. 2 B (right) colocalized well with the green BAC fluorescence. Endosome labeling was not seen when cells were incubated for 2 min with BAC-TMR-dextran at 4 °C instead of 37 °C (images not shown). Calibration of R/G versus [Cl−] in endosomes was done by incubating BAC-TMR-dextran-loaded cells with a high K+ buffer containing an ionophore/bafilomycin mixture to equalize solution and endosomal [Cl−] as described in “Materials and Methods.” R/G was measured in endosomes from 8–10 different cells in three separate cell cultures. Fig. 2 B(left) shows that R/G versus [Cl−] in endosomes is not significantly different from that in solution, indicating that BAC-TMR-dextran fluorescence is Cl−-selective and thus insensitive to other components present in the endosome lumen. The R/G versus [Cl−] calibration was used to determine endosomal [Cl−] under physiological conditions. Fig. 3 A shows TMR and BAC images of J774 cells at 0, 15, and 45 min after pulse labeling together with a pseudocolored ratio image with a [Cl−] scale. Endosomal [Cl−] was fairly uniform in each image and increased with chase time. Fig. 3 B summarizes the kinetics of endosomal [Cl−] in J774 and CHO cells as a function of chase time at 37 °C. Endosomal [Cl−] progressively increased and attained steady-state values after an ∼45-min chase time. Interpretation of these data in terms of driving forces requires knowledge of endosomal pH as well as cytoplasmic pH and [Cl−] (see below). Fig. 3 C shows that Cl− accumulation in endosomes was reversed by the addition of the vacuolar H+ pump inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Here the bafilomycin was added after the 45-min chase period. These data suggest that H+ pump activity drives Cl− accumulation in endosomes. Endosomal pH was measured under the same conditions used in endosomal [Cl−] measurements. The ratioable pH indicator CF-TMR-dextran was used in which CF green fluorescence is pH-sensitive and TMR red fluorescence is pH-insensitive (21Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows a calibration plot of TMR-to-CF red-to-green fluorescence ratio (R/G) versus pH in endosomes. The perfusate contained high [K+] and ionophores/bafilomycin to equalize external and endosomal pH. R/G was sensitive to pH in the range appropriate for endosomal measurements. Fig. 4 B summarizes the time course of endosomal pH in J774 and CHO cells as a function of chase time. Endosomes were labeled with CF-TMR-dextran for 2 min as done for the [Cl−] measurements using BAC-TMR-dextran. As reported in other cell types (19Geisow M.J. Evans W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 150: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 20Yamashiro D.J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2713-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Zen K. Biwersi J. Periasamy N. Verkman A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) endosomes progressively acidified. Bafilomycin addition to the perfusate alkalinized the endosomal lumen as expected (33Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). To relate changes in [Cl−] and pH quantitatively, endosome buffer capacity was measured. Buffer capacity was determined from the prompt pH increase following addition of NH4Cl (5 or 10 mm) to the perfusate (Fig. 4 C) (34Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Rapid entry of NH3 produces luminal alkalinization, which depends on the amount of NH3 entry and endosomal buffer capacity. The endosomal buffer capacities of 36 ± 1 mm/pH unit for J774 cells and 50 ± 3 mm/pH unit for CHO cells (Fig. 4 C, inset) are similar to that of 43 mm/pH unit measured in opossum kidney cells (29Gekle M. Silbernagl S. Pfluegers Arch. 1995; 429: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unlike the bafilomycin-induced alkalinization, NH3-induced alkalinization occurs without net movement of charge across the endosomal-limiting membrane. If Cl− exit from endosomes accompanying bafilomycin-induced alkalinization is the result of charge coupling to maintain electroneutrality, then it is predicted that NH3-induced alkalinization should not be accompanied by Cl− exit. Fig. 5 Ashows that after a 45-min chase following BAC-TMR-dextran pulse labeling, bafilomycin addition resulted in Cl− exit, whereas comparable alkalinization produced by NH4Cl addition did not affect endosomal [Cl−]. This finding in cells also supports the conclusion in solution studies (Fig.1 B, top right) that BAC-TMR-dextran fluorescence is pH-insensitive. The time courses of endosomal acidification (Fig. 4 B) and [Cl−] increase (Fig. 3 B) suggest that the entry of positive charge due to H+ during endosomal acidification can be accounted for by the entry negative charge caused by Cl−. For example, a decrease in pH from 6.5 to 6.0 (where buffer capacity measurements are accurate) in J774 cells produces an H+ influx of 18 mm (βΔpH = 36 mm/pH unit × 0.5 pH unit), similar to the measured increase in [Cl−] of 15 mm. As a further test of the conclusion that Cl− conductance is the major endosomal conductance, the time course of endosomal [Cl−] was measured in the continuous presence of bafilomycin in the perfusate after pulse labeling (Fig. 5 B,closed circles). Endosomal [Cl−] was < 10 mm initially, so that there was a substantial [Cl−] gradient driving Cl− entry (cytoplasmic [Cl−] ∼45 mm, see below). A significant counterion conductance to K+ or other ions would have produced an increase in [Cl−]. Fig.5 B also shows the time course of endosomal [Cl−] after 2 min of pulse labeling with BAC-TMR-dextran in a zero Cl− solution (nitrate replacing Cl−) (open circles). Endosomal [Cl−] increases as in Fig. 3 B, except that [Cl−] are lower than those obtained when BAC-TMR-dextran is internalized in the Cl−-containing PBS. Cytoplasmic pH was measured by excitation ratio imaging (440 nm/490 nm) usi"

LQT2 mutations produce loss-of-function phenotypes and reduceI Kr currents either by the heteromeric assembly of non- or malfunctioning channel subunits with wild type subunits at the cell surface or by retention of misprocessed mutant HERG channels in the endoplasmic reticulum. Misprocessed mutations often encode for channel proteins that are functional upon incorporation into the plasma membrane. As a result the pharmacological correction of folding defects and restoration of protein function are of considerable interest. Here we report that the trafficking-deficient pore mutation HERG G601S was rescued by a series of HERG channel blockers that increased cell surface expression. Rescue by these pharmacological chaperones varied directly with their blocking potency. We used structure-activity relationships and site-directed mutagenesis to define the binding site of the pharmacological chaperones. We found that binding occurred in the inner cavity and correlated with hydrophobicity and cationic charge. Rescue was domain-restricted because the trafficking of two misprocessed mutations in the C terminus, HERG F805C and HERG R823W, was not restored by channel blockers.

These results have stimulated interest in the development of methods to correct folding defects and restore protein function. However, low incubation temperatures are of practical value only “in vitro,” and chemical chaperones work at high concentrations (10–1000 mm) that may restrict their use in patients. A more promising pharmacological strategy has been introduced for misfolded P-glycoprotein mutants using specific substrates and blockers to rescue the target protein (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More recently, pharmacological strategies have been validated further with the rescue of misfolded vasopressin receptors mutants using small organic V2 receptor antagonists (16Morello J.-P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.-F. Lonergan M. Petaejae-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 105: 887-895Crossref Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In LQT2, expression of two trafficking-deficient mutations, HERG N470D and HERG R752W, at low temperature resulted in incorporation of functional channels in the plasma membrane (6Ficker E. Thomas D. Viswanathan P.C. Dennis A.T. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Memmi M. Wible B.A. Kaufman E.S. Iyengar S. Schwartz P.J. Rudy Y. Brown A.M. Am. J.

Incubation with chemical chaperones restored trafficking and rescued functional channels for HERG N470D, a mutation in the transmembrane domain, but was completely ineffective for HERG R752W, a mutation in the cyclic nucleotide binding domain. Similarly, pharmacological rescue of functional channel protein has been reported for HERG N470D when synthesized in the presence of the methanesulfonanilide E4031, the antihistamine astemizole, or the prokinetic drug cisapride, whereas E4031 was completely ineffective when incubated with HERG R752W (6Ficker E.

How blocking molecules interact with HERG channels to stabilize certain mutant conformations for export to the plasma membrane but fail to stabilize others is unknown. Whether block and rescue rely on the same structural determinants of the channel protein and whether pharmacological rescue can be separated from block are also unknown. In the present work we used a series of channel blockers to probe the binding site for drug-induced rescue of protein trafficking in HERG G601S. HERG G601S is a temperature-sensitive missense mutation in the pore region of the channel protein with most channel protein retained in the ER when expressed at physiological temperatures (18Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T. Robertson G.A. Matsuoka R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2290-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In our experiments we were guided by more recent insights into the structure of the methanesulfonanilide binding site of HERG K+channels (19Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 20Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). We used the known structure-activity relationship of the noncardiac drug astemizole to compare the relative efficacies of channel block and channel rescue. We extended our observations by comparing block produced by alkyl-TEA derivatives with their ability to rescue the mutant channels. We show that the inner vestibule of the HERG K+ channel forms the receptor sites for compounds that produce both rescue and block and demonstrate that both sites share the properties of the internal quaternary ammonium receptor site present in most K+ channels. HERG mutations were generated by overlap extension PCR, verified by sequencing, and subcloned into full-length HERG-pcDNA3 as described previously (6Ficker E. Thomas D. Viswanathan P.C. Dennis A.T. Priori S.G. Napolitano C. Memmi M. Wible B.A. Kaufman E.S. Iyengar S. Schwartz P.J. Rudy Y. Brown A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1748-H1756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polyclonal HERG antibody used in Western blots and immunostaining was generated in rabbits against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing the last 112 amino acids of HERG (residues 1048–1159). HERG antiserum was purified on an affinity column consisting either of a short C-terminal peptide corresponding to HERG residues 1102–1121 (TLTLDSLSQVSQFMACEELP) or the entire fusion protein. HEK293 cells maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum plus penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2, were transiently transfected with 2 μg of HERG wild type (WT) or HERG mutant cDNA in 60-mm culture dishes using LipofectAMINE/Plus as recommended by manufacturer (Invitrogen). Some experiments were performed using COS-7 cells. After transfection, cells were incubated for 48 h at either 26 or 37 °C. For Western blot experiments, HERG channel blockers were diluted in prewarmed culture medium and added for 12–16 h to cells 36 h post-transfection. Trafficking of HERG WT channels was studied using a stable cell line established in HEK293 cells. Cells were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), containing protease inhibitor mix (Complete, Roche Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). N-Glycosidase F treatments (NEB P0704S) were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. For Western blotting, proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal HERG antibody (1:100 dilution; 1 h at room temperature) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000; 1 h at room temperature; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used for blot development. Immunoblot images were captured directly on a Storm PhosphorImager to quantify image densities of HERG protein bands. For densitometric analysis pixel densities of fully glycosylated HERG protein bands were integrated from equal areas after background subtraction using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Image densities were normalized for maximal densities measured during treatment with increasing concentrations of astemizole, cisapride, E4031, and quinidine. Image densities measured in vehicle-treated (ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide) HERG G601S controls were defined as zero protein expression levels. Densitometric analysis of experiments done with quaternary ammonium ions were normalized to fully glycosylated protein bands detected after incubation with maximal rescue concentrations (5 μm) of either astemizole or E4031. In these experiments, protein isolated in parallel from either astemizole- or E4031-treated cells was run on the same gel and immunoblotted together with experimental samples treated with quaternary ammonium ions to get independent measures of differences in rescue efficacy. Rescue concentration response curves were constructed from three or four independent experiments covering the entire concentration range by fitting Hill equations (see below) to mean values ± S.E. For electrophysiological experiments HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out overnight in 35-mm culture dishes using a modified Ca2+phosphate method. We transfected 2 μg of channel cDNA together with 0.5 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein cDNA to allow for identification of successfully transfected cells. One day after transfection, HEK cells were replated onto coverslips and incubated with drug-containing culture medium. On the day of the experiment, cells were transferred to control medium 2 h before current recordings were started. Dose-response relationships for C6-TEA, C8-TEA, C10-TEA and C8-TMA (quaternary ammonium) were measured using HEK cells stably transfected with HERG WT. In these experiments IC50 values were determined in cells held at 0 mV to simulate the ER membrane potential. Channel blockade was measured by analyzing reinactivating HERG current amplitudes on return to 0 mV after a 10-ms voltage clamp pulse to −140 mV. Concentration-response relationships for quaternary ammonium block were fit to Hill equations of the form shown in Equation 1, Idrug/Icontrol=1/(1+(D/IC50)m)Equation 1 where I indicates current, D is drug concentrations, n is the Hill coefficient, and IC50 is the concentration necessary for half-maximal block. Patch pipettes were filled with (in mm): 100 potassium aspartate, 20 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.2). The extracellular solution had the following composition (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose (pH 7.4). No leak subtraction was applied. All current recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). To analyze changes in current densities membrane capacitances were measured using the analog compensation circuit of an Axon 200B patch clamp amplifier. Pclamp software (Axon Instruments) was used for generation of voltage clamp protocols and data acquisition. Whenever possible data are presented as mean ± S.E. of n experiments. Astemizole and norastemizole were kindly provided by Janssen (Beerse, Belgium). E4031 was a gift from Eisai (Tokyo, Japan). Cisapride was obtained from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ); quinidine was purchased from Sigma Chemical. C8-TMA was bought as bromide salt from Fluka and TCI America. Asymmetrical tetraethyl ammonium compounds (C-TEA) were synthesized as described previously (21Jarolimek W. Soman K.V. Alam M. Brown A.M. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 430: 672-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, one part of triethylamine was added to one part alkylbromide in the presence of absolute ethanol and heated under gentle refluxing for 8–10 h. Recrystallized alkyl-TEA compounds were tested for identity by NMR and elementary analysis. HERG G601S is located in the S5-pore helix linker and was described as a trafficking-deficient, hypomorphic LQT2 mutant expressing greatly reduced, kinetically unaltered currents when expressed in mammalian cells at physiological temperature (18Furutani M. Trudeau M.C. Hagiwara N. Seki A. Gong Q. Zhou Z. Imamura S. Nagashima H. Kasanuki H. Takao A. Momma K. January C.T. Robertson G.A. Matsuoka R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2290-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Much larger currents were recorded on expression in Xenopusoocytes, indicating restoration of protein trafficking at lower incubation temperatures. The trafficking defect was reflected in Western blots in which the channel protein was detected only as a core-glycosylated immature protein of 135 kDa when isolated from transiently transfected cells incubated at 37 °C (Fig.1 B1). On incubation at 26 °C an additional band at 155 kDa appeared representing the fully mature channel protein (see Fig. 5 B). These results showed that HERG G601S is a temperature-sensitive trafficking mutant with few channels evading quality control at 37 °C.Figure 5Structure-function studies of pharmacological rescue using astemizole and norastemizole. Panel A, Western blot analysis of equal amounts (20 μg) of total protein from cells expressing HERG G601S. Protein processing is analyzed in the presence of increasing amounts of astemizole (A) and norastemizole (NA). Panel B, HERG G601S trafficking is restored by incubation at lower temperature (26 °C);A5.0 indicates rescue by 5 μm astemizole. The double mutated channel HERG G601S/F656C is rescued at a lower incubation temperature (26 °C) but not by incubation with 5 μm astemizole. Panel C, HERG 601S and HERG G601S/F656C are shown in the presence of increasing amounts of astemizole (A). Markers indicate core-glycosylated protein at 135 kDa and mature, fully glycosylated protein at about 155 kDa. All drugs were applied in the micromolar concentration range with individual concentrations indicated above the immunoblots. Panel D, rescue-response curves for HERG G601S incubated with increasing concentrations of astemizole and norastemizole and for HERG G601S/F656C with astemizole. Half-maximal rescue concentrations RC50 were 0.06 ± 0.03 μm for HERG G601S and astemizole, 1.4 ± 0.5 μm for HERG G601S and norastemizole. The efficacy of rescue is reduced dramatically for HERG G601S treated with norastemizole and for HERG G601S/F656C treated with astemizole (n = 3 or 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tested three HERG channel blockers for restoration of G601S trafficking at 37 °C. These blockers appear to interact with different portions of the extended binding site for methanesulfonanilides in the inner vestibule of HERG (19Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). We used E4031, a methanesulfonanilide drug in which the methanesulfonyl group is thought to bind to a pocket formed between the pore helix and the S6 helix and its aromatic piperidine ring to aromatic amino acid residues at Tyr-652 and Phe-656. We also tested the prokinetic drug cisapride, which is thought to interact with Tyr-652 and Phe-656 but not with the S6/pore helix pocket. Finally we tested the antiarrhythmic drug quinidine, which is thought to interact mainly with Phe-656 but not with the inactivated state of the HERG channel (20Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). In electrophysiological experiments HERG currents were blocked in mammalian cells by E4031 with an IC50 of 7–10 nm (22Abbott G.W.

Cisapride blocked HERG currents with an IC50 of 6–7 nm (24Rampe D. Roy M. Dennis A. Brown A.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 25Mohammad S. Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2534-H2538PubMed Google Scholar), and quinidine blocked with an IC50 of about 1 μm (26Poo S.S. Wang D.W. Yang I.C. Johnson J.P. Nie L. Bennett P.B. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 33: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Yang T. Roden D.M. Circulation. 1996; 93: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We tested whether all of these drugs restored HERG G601S trafficking in a concentration-dependent manner and whether the difference in interaction with the methanesulfonanilide binding site was reflected in their ability to rescue HERG G601S. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with HERG G601S cDNA, incubated for 36 h at 37 °C, and then exposed overnight to different concentrations of cisapride (Fig. 1 B1), quinidine (Fig. 1 C), and E4031 (Fig. 1 D) before immunoblotting. In vehicle-treated control cells only a core-glycosylated protein band of 135 kDa could be detected (Fig. 1,B–D). With increasing drug concentrations an additional 155 kDa band appeared which could be reduced to a smaller form of about 130 kDa by treatment with N-glycosidase F, an enzyme used to remove all carbohydrate residues from glycoproteins (Fig.1 B2). The fully glycosylated 155-kDa form of the channel protein which could be detected after exposure of G601S cells to the different channel blockers was quantified using a PhosphorImager, normalized, and plotted as a function of drug concentration (Fig.1 E). All three drugs restored trafficking of HERG G601S, with half-maximal rescue concentrations (RC50) of 0.6 ± 0.1 μm for cisapride, 1.1 ± 0.2 μmfor E4031, and 1.7 ± 0.4 μm for quinidine (n = 3 or 4). For WT protein both the 135- and the 155-kDa forms are synthesized at 37 °C (Fig.2 A, con), and expression of the mature fully glycosylated channel protein at 155 kDa is not modified significantly when cells expressing HERG WT are exposed to channel blockers at concentrations that maximally restore trafficking in HERG G601S (Fig. 2 B). To test whether the increased production of fully glycosylated mature G601S protein by HERG blockers was accompanied by increased expression of functional channels we measured G601S currents in vehicle-treated control cells and in cells exposed 48 h to saturating concentrations of cisapride (5 μm), E4031 (5 μm) and quinidine (100 μm). In these experiments the different drugs were washed out 2 h before the start of patch clamp recordings. Fig.3 A illustrates current recordings from a control cell expressing G601S at 37 °C and from a cell treated for 12 h with 5 μm cisapride. Rescued G601S channels showed no alteration in kinetic properties compared with untreated mutant channels (data not shown). However, current densities increased in the presence of saturating concentrations of cisapride, E4031, and quinidine from 54 ± 7 pA/pF (control) to 116 ± 17, 147 ± 39 and 96 ± 8 pA/pF, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Despite a significant increase, current densities remained smaller in G601S than in cells transiently transfected with equal amounts of WT cDNA (382 ± 50 pA/pF). This difference was not the result of incomplete washout of HERG blockers because in control experiments about 80% of WT current density was recovered after treatment with 5 μm astemizole (309 ± 32 pA/pF, Fig. 3 B). Astemizole is a second generation antihistamine that blocked HERG with an IC50 of 0.9 nm (28Zhou Z. Vorperian V.R. Gong Q. Zhang S. January C.T. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In humans it undergoes oxidative N-alkylation generating norastemizole (Fig.4) reported to have a reduced IC50 of 27.7 nm with about 50% of HERG current resistant to block by norastemizole (28Zhou Z. Vorperian V.R. Gong Q. Zhang S. January C.T. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1999; 10: 836-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that hydrophobic side chains attached to tertiary amines in noncardiac HERG-blocking antihistamines are important for block (29Zhang M.Q. Curr. Med. Chem. 1997; 4: 171-184Google Scholar). We asked whether these side chains were also important for rescue of HERG G601S. In immunoblotting experiments the RC50 for G601S with the parent drug astemizole was determined to be 0.06 ± 0.03 μm (Fig. 5 D). For norastemizole we measured a RC50 of 1.4 ± 0.5 μm with maximally 30% of the fully glycosylated protein recovered compared with rescue experiments using astemizole (Fig. 5,A and D). This result provided evidence that efficacies for both block and rescue correlate with each other. Given this assumption we hypothesized that mutations in the drug binding site of HERG should similarly abolish restoration of trafficking. Recently it has been reported that high affinity drug binding in HERG is dominated by a phenylalanine in position 656 (19Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Lin M. Culberson C. Sanguinetti M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12329-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 20Lees-Miller J.P. Duan Y. Teng G.Q. Duff H.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar). We mutated the Phe-656 to Cys-656. This mutation did not modify HERG currents (data not shown) but dramatically reduced the affinity for astemizole (Fig.3 C). HERG F656C was not trafficking-deficient but was retained in the ER when combined with the trafficking mutation 601S (HERG G601S/F656C) with trafficking being restored by incubation at 26 °C (Fig. 5 B). In contrast to G601S, however, the affinity of the double mutant for astemizole block was dramatically reduced (Figs. 3 C and 5 B). In line with our hypothesis we found that the double mutated channel was not rescued by astemizole (Fig. 5, C and D). Even at high concentrations only about 15% of fully glycosylated protein was recovered compared with HERG G601S. The suppression of pharmacological rescue by the F656C mutation provides further evidence that just as for block, rescue involves interactions with the inner vestibule of the HERG channel. For antihistamines and class III antiarrhythmic blockers of HERG a general structure has been proposed consisting of aromatic benzene rings, which are connected via a short chain to a basic nitrogen atom with the basic nitrogen carrying additional hydrophobic substituents (29Zhang M.Q. Curr. Med. Chem. 1997; 4: 171-184Google Scholar). In this model the tertiary amine at physiological pH is mainly in the protonated quaternary form and resembles quaternary ammonium ions such as TEA, which are known to be potent potassium channel blockers. We used alkyl-TEA derivatives to probe the molecular characteristics of the rescue site in HERG G601S. In squid axon it was shown that block by TEA compounds increased with increasing alkyl chain length and that at a given chain length block decreased with changes in the size of the remaining N-substituents (30Armstrong C.M.

However, the coupling mechanism between endoplasmic reticulum stores to activate plasma membrane SOCs remains unknown. In DT40 chicken B lymphocytes, the permeant inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) modifier, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), was a powerful activator of store-operated Ca2+ entry between 1–10 μm. 2-APB activated authentic SOCs because the entry was totally selective for Ca2+ (no detectable entry of Ba2+ or Sr2+ ions), and highly sensitive to La3+ ions (IC50 30–100 nm). To assess the role of InsP3Rs in this response, we used the DT40 triple InsP3R-knockout (ko) cell line, DT40InsP3R-ko, in which the absence of full-length InsP3Rs or InsP3R fragments was verified by Western analysis using antibodies cross-reacting with N-terminal epitopes of all three chicken InsP3R subtypes. The 2-APB-induced activation of SOCs was identical in the DT40InsP3R-ko, cells indicating InsP3Rs were not involved. With both wild type (wt) and ko DT40 cells, 2-APB had no effect on Ca2+ entry in store-replete cells, indicating that its action was restricted to SOCs in a store-coupled state. 2-APB induced a robust activation of Ca2+ release from stores in intact DT40wt cells but not in DT40InsP3R-ko cells, indicating an InsP3R-mediated effect. In contrast, 2-APB blocked InsP3Rs in permeabilized DT40wt cells, suggesting that the stimulatory action of 2-APB was restricted to functionally coupled InsP3Rs in intact cells. Uncoupling of ER/PM interactions in intact cells by calyculin A-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement prevented SOC activation by store-emptying and 2-APB; this treatment completely prevented 2-APB-induced InsP3R activation but did not alter InsP3R activation mediated by phospholipase C-coupled receptor stimulation. The results indicate that the robust bifunctional actions of 2-APB on both SOCs and InsP3Rs are dependent on the coupled state of these channels and suggest that 2-APB may target the coupling machinery involved in mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry.

G protein-coupled receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors, through activation of phospholipase C, generate the second messenger, InsP3, which diffuses rapidly within the cytosol to interact with InsP3Rs on the ER; the InsP3Rs serve as Ca2+ channels to release luminally stored Ca2+ and generate the initial Ca2+ signal phase (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar, 4Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2250) Google Scholar). The resulting depletion of Ca2+ stored within the ER lumen serves as the primary trigger for a message that is returned to the plasma membrane resulting in the slow activation of “store-operated channels” (SOCs), which mediate capacitative Ca2+ entry (3Putney J.W.

This second Ca2+ entry phase of Ca2+ signals serves to mediate longer-term cytosolic Ca2+ elevations and provides a means of replenishing intracellular stores (3Putney J.W. Bird G.S.

Recent evidence has indicated that the InsP3R may be a component in mediating the coupling process between stores and Ca2+ entry channels. In particular, a role for the InsP3R has been implicated in the activation of the TRP family of receptor-activated channels, which share a number of functional parameters with SOCs including reports that they are store-operated (15Birnbaumer L.

Recently, we have probed the role played by InsP3Rs in Ca2+ entry mechanisms utilizing cells from the DT40 chicken B lymphocyte line (DT40InsP3R-ko) in which the InsP3R genes have been disrupted (30Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It was observed that these cells have store-operated Ca2+ entry that is functionally the same as that occurring in the wild type DT40 cells (30Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 31Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K., Li, H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15945-15952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that TRPC3 channels transiently expressed in DT40InsP3R-ko cells or DT40wt cells were in both cases functionally activated in response to phospholipase C-coupled receptors (33Venkatachalam K., Ma, H.T. Ford D.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33980-33985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the InsP3R was not necessary for SOC or TRP channel activation. Recent work has also focused on the permeant InsP3 receptor antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (34Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), to probe the role of the InsP3R in coupling to activate SOC and TRP channels. At concentrations around 50 μm, the 2-APB molecule inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry, blocking the activation of SOCs in response to store depletion with Ca2+pump blockers or ionomycin (35Ma H.-T.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28562-28568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). 2-APB also blocks activation of mammalian TRPC3 channels (35Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and TRP channels mediating theDrosophila light response (37Chorna-Ornan I. Joel-Almagor T. Ben Ami H.C. Frechter S. Gillo B. Selinger Z. Gill D.L. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2622-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the case of both of these TRP channels, the action of 2-APB does not appear to be directly upon the TRP channels themselves but rather upon an upstream target that is involved perhaps in controlling the activation of the channels (35Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 37Chorna-Ornan I. Joel-Almagor T. Ben Ami H.C. Frechter S. Gillo B. Selinger Z. Gill D.L. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2622-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently determined that the blocking action of 2-APB on SOCs was still observed in the DT40InsP3R-ko cells (31Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K., Li, H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting that this action of 2-APB was not mediated by the InsP3R. Considering these recent results and the fact that they appeared to contradict a large body of evidence implicating a role for InsP3Rs in SOC activation, it was crucial to obtain more information on the function of SOCs and the actions of 2-APB in the DT40 cell lines. It was also essential to determine more definitively whether the DT40InsP3R-ko cells were truly devoid of InsP3R translation products. Thus, it was suggested (17Kiselyov K.I., Xu, X. Mohayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) that truncated InsP3R genes replacing the original genes in these cells could give rise to expression of C-terminally truncated InsP3Rs (17Kiselyov K.I., Xu, X. Mohayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I.N. Mignery G.A. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S.

Here we provide the results of exhaustive Western analyses establishing that the DT40InsP3R-ko cells are devoid of detectable InsP3Rs or fragments thereof. We also reveal that robust bifunctional actions of 2-APB on both SOCs and InsP3Rs in DT40wt cells are dependent on the coupled state of these channels and suggest that 2-APB may target the coupling machinery involved in mediating store-operated Ca2+ entry. Cells of both the wild type DT40 chicken B cell line (DT40wt) and triple InsP3 receptor knockout cell line (DT40InsP3R-ko) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine, as described previously (30Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Cells grown on coverslips for 1 h were transferred to Hepes-buffered Krebs medium (107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mmglucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4) and loaded with fura-2/AM (2 μm) for 25 min at 20 °C. Cells were washed, and dye was allowed to de-esterify for a minimum of 15 min at 20 °C. Approximately 95% of the dye was confined to the cytoplasm as determined by the signal remaining after saponin permeabilization (38Short A.D. Klein M.G. Schneider M.F. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25887-25893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission at 505 nm was monitored with excitation at 340 and 380 nm. Ca2+measurements are shown as 340/380 nm ratios obtained from groups of 10–12 cells. Resting Ca2+ levels in the two DT40 cell lines were similar at ∼100–130 nm. All measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three, and in most cases, a larger number of independent experiments. Cells of both of the DT40 lines as well as the A7r5 smooth muscle and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (CHO; used as InsP3R positive controls) were homogenized and treated exactly as described previously (40Parys J.B., De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Bootman M.D. Sienaert I. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with the exception that for both DT40wt and DT40InsP3R-ko cells the analyses used cell homogenates and not isolated membranes. All samples were rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C, protein determinations were performed by the Lowry procedure. For InsP3R detection, samples were boiled for 2 min in sample buffer, separated on 3–12% Laemmli-type linear gradient gels, transferred to Immobilon-P, and probed with the following antibody preparations directed against InsP3R N-terminal domains: (a) the polyclonal anti-cytI3b-1 and anti-cytI3b-2 antisera directed against Ca2+-binding site 3b (amino acids 378–450) of the type-1 InsP3R (41Sipma H., De Smet P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12157-12162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); (b) the polyclonal Rbt226 and Rbt227 antisera directed against amino acids 330–344 of the type-2 InsP3R (42Vanlingen S.

J. 2000; 346: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (c) the monoclonal antibody MMAtype3 against amino acids 22–230 of the type-3 InsP3R (I31220, Transduction Laboratories) (43De Smedt H. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. Henning R.H. Sienaert I. Vanlingen S. Gijsens A. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of the polyclonal anti-cytI3b-1 antiserum was performed by a 2-h preincubation of the antiserum with an excess of antigenic peptide. A new antibody was developed recognizing a conserved epitope localized in the N-terminal portion of the three InsP3R isoforms. The synthetic peptide KSNKYLTVNKRLPAL corresponding to amino acids 127–141 of the human type-1 InsP3R, which is conserved between isoforms and between diverse vertebrate species, was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through an additional C-terminal cysteine. Two rabbits (Rbt475 and Rbt476) were repeatedly immunized with the coupled peptide. Both antisera reacted with high affinity against each of the InsP3R isoforms from various sources. These antisera were further affinity-purified against the peptide. Finally, for some control experiments the N-terminal InsP3R antiserum AbC (44Cardy T.J. Traynor D. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was also used. Analysis of the immunoreactive bands was performed after incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to alkaline phosphatase detected by using VistraTM ECF (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) and fluorimaged as described before (45Vanlingen S. Parys J.B. Missiaen L., De Smedt H. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 475-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The procedures for cell permeabilization cells were as described earlier (46Rys-Sikora K.E. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31607-31613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Rys-Sikora K.E. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32627-32635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of DT40 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were stirred gently and incubated with 0.0025% saponin in an intracellular-like medium (ICM) (comprising 140 mmKCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.0) at 37 °C until 95% permeabilization occurred (normally after 6–7 min). After permeabilization, cells were washed twice in saponin-free ICM at 4 °C and kept cold before use in experiments. To avoid problems of lipid dilution of added hydrophobic compounds, the final cell concentration in all experiments was kept at exactly 5 × 105 cells/ml. Ca2+ flux measurements were conducted as described previously (47Rys-Sikora K.E. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32627-32635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 48Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11955-11961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The accumulation of45Ca2+ into intracellular organelles was measured using permeabilized DT40 cells (5 × 105cells/ml) maintained by gentle stirring at 37 °C in ICM containing 50 μm CaCl2 (with 150 Ci/mol45Ca2+), EGTA to buffer free Ca2+ to exactly 0.1 μm, 3% polyethylene glycol, and 5 μm ruthenium red (to prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation) in a total volume of 2 ml. Effectors mentioned in the figures (2-APB) were added at the times shown. Oxalate with GTP when present was added immediately prior to the start of uptake. At the required times, 200-μl aliquots were removed from the stirred uptake medium, diluted immediately into 4 ml of ice-cold ICM containing 1 mm LaCl3, and then rapidly vacuum-filtered on glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/B), washed, and counted. The figures show ATP-dependent Ca2+accumulation with that component of Ca2+ retained by the cells and filters in the absence of ATP, subtracted (∼0.1% of total Ca2+). The experiments shown are typical of at least three separate experiments. ATP, GTP, EGTA, polyethylene glycol, saponin, ruthenium red, Hepes, and oxalate were purchased from Sigma. 2-APB was from Tocris (Ballwin, MO). Thapsigargin was from LC Services (Woburn, MA). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The DT40 cell lines were generously provided by Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki (Kyoto, Japan). For Ca2+ flux experiments, free Ca2+ concentrations were controlled using EGTA computing all complexes between EGTA, ATP, Ca2+, Mg2+, monovalent cations, and protons, as described previously (50Ghosh T.K. Mullaney J.M. Tarazi F.I. Gill D.L. Nature. 1989; 340: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Anti-chicken IgM (supernatant, M-4 clone) was from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). The AbC antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. C. W. Taylor (University of Cambridge, UK). Considering the potential significance of 2-APB in targeting the activation of SOCs and TRP channels, we examined the details of the kinetics of action of 2-APB. Surprisingly, 2-APB was observed to induce a robust biphasic modification of SOC function in DT40 chicken B-lymphocytes. Using DT40wt cells in which Ca2+ stores had been previously depleted with thapsigargin, the addition of Ca2+ resulted in the onset of SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry, as shown in Fig.1. After SOC activation, the addition of low levels of 2-APB (1–10 μm) induced a rapid and profound stimulation of Ca2+ entry (Fig. 1,A–C) with a maximal effect at 10 μm. In contrast, at higher levels (25–75 μm), the action of 2-APB was strongly inhibitory on SOCs (Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, although there was an initial transient increase in Ca2+entry, this subsided to reveal a powerful blocking action. At the higher levels of 2-APB, the stimulatory effect was extremely brief such that at 75 μm there was an almost imperceptible activation followed rapidly by almost complete inhibition of Ca2+ entry. Indeed, we had previously observed the inhibitory action of 2-APB on SOCs (31Ma H.-T. Venkatachalam K., Li, H.S. Montell C. Kurosaki T. Patterson R.L. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18888-18896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) but had not examined the effects of acute addition of submaximally effective 2-APB levels on preactivated SOC activity. The biphasic effects of 2-APB on SOCs were not unique to the DT40 cells because we observed similar effects of 2-APB in HEK293 cells, DC3-F fibroblasts, and DDT1MF-2 smooth muscle cells (data not shown). In these cells the stimulatory effect with low levels of 2-APB was smaller, but the overall biphasic effect was similar. One particular reason why the nature and coupling of SOCs has remained elusive is that modifiers of the activation process have not been identified. Whereas there have been reports on a variety of agents that can inhibit SOC activity (51Putney J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Springer, New York1997Crossref Google Scholar), almost invariably such agents have been shown to be highly nonselective, modifying a range of other channels for Ca2+ and/or other ions. In contrast, the action of 2-APB on SOCs reflects a much more selective function, 2-APB having little or no effect on a range of Ca2+ and related channels including ryanodine receptors (34Maruyama T.

Interactions between Aβ and neuronal membranes have been postulated to play an important role in the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that Aβ is able to insert into lipid bilayer. The membrane insertion ability of Aβ is critically controlled by the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids. In a low concentration of cholesterol Aβ prefers to stay in membrane surface region mainly in a β-sheet structure. In contrast, as the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids rises above 30 mol%, Aβ can insert spontaneously into lipid bilayer by its C terminus. During membrane insertion Aβ generates about 60% α-helix and removes almost all β-sheet structure. Fibril formation experiments show that such membrane insertion can reduce fibril formation. Our findings reveal a possible pathway by which Aβ prevents itself from aggregation and fibril formation by membrane insertion. β-Amyloid peptide (Aβ), a normal constituent of neuronal and non-neuronal cells, has been proven to be the major component of extracellular plaque of Alzheimer's disease.

It can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid at subnanomolar concentrations in normal individuals. Such a concentration of Aβ has its own physiological functions, for example, increasing tyrosine phosphorylation, increasing the activity of phosphoinositol 3-kinase, and inducing the rapid change of cellular calcium and extracellular protein kinase C (5Mills J. Reiner P.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was reported that in cultured hippocampal neurons, Aβ at a low concentration (10−11∼10−10m) is neurotrophic to undifferentiated, immature hippocampal neurons (6Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Esch F.

Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic enzymes in lysosomes then can degrade Aβ. Thus, whether Aβ is the primary effector of the disease is questioned. Several studies on conformation show that Aβ in the core of amyloid plaques adopts an antiparallel β-sheet (17Inouye H. Fraser P.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 502-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). So Aβ in the form of β-sheet may be in favor of aggregating into fibril. In addition,in vitro studies with cell cultures have demonstrated that fibrillar Aβ is toxic to neurons, but monomeric Aβ is not (18Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Simmons L.K. May P.C. Tomaselli K.J. Rydel R.E. Fuson K.S. Brigham E.F. Wright S. Lieberburg I. Becker G.W. Brems D.N. Mol.

Therefore, the factors inducing Aβ to generate β-sheet may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The neurotoxicity of Aβ is exhibited in many fields. One of the potential mechanisms for inducing the neurotoxicity of Aβ is direct interaction with the membranes. It has been reported that Aβ is able to form ionic pores (21Arispe N. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10573-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Aβ can destroy the structure of brain membranes (22Eckert G.P. Cairns N.J. Maras A. Gattaz W.F. Muller W.E. Dementia Geriatric Cognitive Dis. 2000; 11: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and may stimulate free radical production by interfering with the regulation of calcium homeostasis and cell enzymatic activity (23Waiter M.F. Mason P.E. Mason R.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Aβ can also alter the physical-chemical properties of neuronal membranes, including membrane fluidity, membrane lipid dynamics, and the activity of various membrane-bound proteins (24Martinez-Senac M.M. Villalaı́n J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 744-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Mason R.P. Estermyer J.D. Kelly J.F. Mason P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present work we emphasize how lipid membrane affects the behavior of Aβ. In particular we study the membrane insertion of Aβ(1–40), the major species normally secreted from cells (26Roher A.E. Clarke S. Wood A.S. Cotter R.J. Gowing E. Ball M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10836-10840Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), by lipid monolayer and vesicle systems. First, we used the monolayer technique to detect the membrane insertion ability of Aβ. Second, we carried out a combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) with enzymatic hydrolysis to confirm the membrane insertion of Aβ into phospholipid vesicles. And third, we employed circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to study the conformational change of Aβ upon insertion. Finally, electron microscopy work tested that membrane insertion of Aβ could reduce the formation of fibril. Our results show that Aβ(1–40) is able to insert into lipid bilayer and that there is a close correlation between membrane insertion of Aβ and its secondary structure, which is critically dependent upon the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids. Our findings suggest the possibility that Aβ may prevent itself from aggregating by membrane insertion. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and cholesterol were all purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. β-Amyloid peptides Aβ(1–40) and (1–28) were purchased from AnaSpec Co., whose purity (>95%) was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and checked by MALDI-TOF MS. And unless stated, Aβ refers to Aβ(1–40) in the following text. Papain and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CCA) used in hydrolysis were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and manufactured in China. Usually the subphase buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 25 mmNaCl. The monolayer surface pressure (π), defined as the change of the surface tension after spreading a monolayer on the water surface, was measured with an NIMA 9000 (England) microbalance. The peptide insertion was determined by a circular Teflon trough with a volume of 4 ml and surface area of 10 cm2. A filter paper of 1.0-cm width was employed as the Wihelmy plate. The surface pressure measurements were made with the plate in a fixed height position, and the data were automatically collected and recorded by computer. In general, the experiments were conducted as follows. First, the circular trough was filled with 4 ml of buffer. Then the phospholipid monolayers were prepared by carefully spreading the lipid solution (dissolved in a solvent of chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v) with a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml) onto the buffer surface. After the surface pressure stabilized at a constant desired value, the initial surface pressure (πi), Aβ was injected into the subphase through a side sample hole. The pressure change was monitored until the surface pressure increase (Δπ) had reached a maximal value, usually within 2 h. The water used was deionized, and the subphase buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 25 mmNaCl. During the measurement, the subphase was stirred continuously with a magnetic bar. The temperature was controlled at 24.0 ± 1.0 °C. Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared as follows. Lipids of the desired composition were mixed in chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v) and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Residual solvents were removed under high vacuum for 5–7 h. The lipid films were then resuspended and sonicated in the desired buffer to near optical clarity by using a probe sonicator. The metal debris from the titanium tip was eliminated by centrifugation. The concentration of phospholipid was determined by phosphate analysis (27Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3000) Google Scholar). The enzyme used to hydrolyze Aβ was papain, isolated from the latex of Carica papaya. Papain consists of a single polypeptide chain with 212 residues, and the molecular mass is about 23 kDa (28Zhuang P. Butterfield D.A. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 623-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Papain's specific hydrolytic sites are Glu-X, Gly-X, Tyr-X, His-X, Lys-X, and Arg-X. For convenient measurement of MS the enzymatic hydrolysis of Aβ was carried out in low ion strength buffer (10 mm Tris-HAc, pH 7.4) at 37 °C in Eppendorf tubes. In a typical experiment, before hydrolysis, vesicles sonicated in the same buffer reacted with Aβ, and at the same time, Aβ in an identical volume of buffer only (without vesicles) was prepared as a control. The reaction was started by the addition of a certain amount of peptide solution to acquire a 16 (mol/mol) ratio of peptide to enzyme. The final concentration of peptide added was determined by pre-experiments to give the peak of molecular ion. After 40 min of reaction, iodoacetamide was injected to stop the reaction. Then the mixture was used for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The instrument used here is BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer made by Bruker Daltonics Co. A pulsed nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm was used to generate the MALDI ions. The matrix used in these experiments was CCA. CCA was dissolved in a solution of a 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for sample preparation. A 0.5-μl aliquot of CCA mixture was added into an Eppendorf tube and then mixed with 0.5 μl of a reaction solution of peptide and papain. The final peptide/matrix mixture in the Eppendorf tube was deposited on a stainless steel probe tip and allowed to dry at room temperature. CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Samples were scanned at least 10 times at the rate of 200 nm/min with a 0.5 nm step, 1 nm bandwidth, and then averaged. The path length of the quartz cell was 2 mm. In the experiments, a blank run made with the vesicles or buffer alone was carefully subtracted from the experimental spectra for correction. The 200–250 nm spectra were used for analysis and calculation because in this wavelength range, the vesicle scattering had little effect on the CD spectra. All spectra were smoothed and converted to the mean residue ellipticity, [θ] in deg*cm2/dmol, by using a mean residue molecular mass of 110; the secondary structure of the peptide was estimated from spectral simulations based on reference CD spectra of Yang et al. (29Yang J.T., Wu, C.S.C. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). In a general experiment, a desired amount of vesicle solution, determined by a lipid:protein ratio of 100, was added to an Eppendorf tube, and then 1 mg/ml Aβ was injected to acquire a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. After incubation for 90 min (providing enough time for the interaction between Aβ and vesicles), the mixture was measured by the spectropolarimeter. For the vesicle-containing the sample preparation, vesicle solution was first added into an Eppendorf tube, and then a certain amount of protein solution was injected to reach a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. After storage at 37 °C for 2 days the vesicle suspensions were applied to carbon-coated copper grids, dried, negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, and visualized in a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscopy operated at 120 kV. As a control the same procedure was performed for the sample containing only peptide without vesicles. In the experiments we have applied a model that assumes that the surface pressure will increase only when the protein inserts into the monolayer, and the surface pressure, as reported earlier (30Demel R.A. London Y. Geurts Van Kessel W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), does not increase if the protein only interacts with the phospholipid head group. Thus, when peptide molecules are injected into the subphase, the corresponding change in surface pressure (Δπ) can be interpreted as the result of the peptide inserting into the lipid monolayer. Δπ can be obtained as a function of various πi for each sample, and then the plot of Δπ versus πi yields a straight line with negative slope which intersects the abscissa at a limiting surface pressure. The limiting surface pressure is defined as the critical insertion pressure (πc) of Aβ for the corresponding lipid monolayer, which is used as a quantitative measure to evaluate the insertion ability of the peptide to the phospholipid monolayer. To acquire appropriate conditions of the experiments, first the surface activity of Aβ was detected by measuring the self-penetration of Aβ into the air-water interface without spread lipid monolayer. The peptide solution was injected into the subphase to a final concentration of 200, 400, 500, 600, and 800 nm, and the surface pressure was then measured and plotted versus the reaction time. The results (data not shown) show that Aβ could significantly increase the surface pressure, which indicates its strong surface activity. The maximum Δπ induced by the self-penetration of Aβ was found to be 13.7 mN/m, and the minimum concentration of Aβ to reach such a maximum was 500 nm. Thus, we kept πi of the lipid monolayers spread onto the subphase surface at or above 15.0 mN/m and the concentration of Aβ injected into the subphase at 500 nm in the following experiments. To measure the ability of Aβ to insert into phospholipid monolayers at the air-water interface, samples of different phospholipids were used. Fig. 1 A shows the plots of Δπ versus πi of Aβ for pure DPPC monolayer and for its mixtures with different molar fraction of cholesterol. From the plots of Fig. 1 A the values of πc are obtained to be 26.6 mN/m for DPPC, and 26.2, 26.2, 32.1, 34.1, and 33.8 mN/m for DPPC containing 20, 25, 33, 56, and 74 mol% cholesterol, respectively. Fig. 1 B shows the correlation between πc and mol content of cholesterol. Clearly, there is a sharp increase in πc as the content of cholesterol rises above 30 mol%. The same insertion experiments of Aβ were performed also for DMPC and cholesterol mixtures (data not shown). We found that the value of πc for pure DMPC was ∼25 mN/m and for 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC ∼31 mN/m. DMPC exhibits a cholesterol effect similar to that of DPPC. These results indicate that cholesterol can strongly influence the insertion ability of Aβ into PC monolayers. Further experiments, as shown in Fig. 2, were performed for PC monolayers containing a certain amount of sphingomyelin (SPM) and cerebroside, imitating the content in brain membrane. From the Δπ∼πi curves of Fig. 2, it can be seen that only the addition of SPM or cerebroside has little influence on the insertion ability of Aβ. In the presence of 33% cholesterol, however, for both mixtures, PC/SPM and PC/cerebroside, the πc is obviously shifted to higher surface pressure, 32–33 mN/m. Such behavior provides evidence that it is cholesterol that contributes to the most increase of πc. In addition, the correlation between πc and mol fraction of cholesterol in PC/SPM mixtures was also measured (data not shown). The result showed a behavior similar to that exhibited in Fig.1 B, indicating again that the insertion ability of Aβ has a sharp increase when the content of cholesterol higher than 30 mol%. The above results indicate that the insertion ability of Aβ(1–40) is critically dependent upon the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids. It has been established that the biological membrane pressure is 31–34 mN/m (31Demel R.A. Geurts Van Kessel W.S. Zwaal R.F. Roelofsen B. van Deenen L.L. Bichim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The packing density of lipid monolayer with a surface pressure in this region can be assumed to be comparable with that of lipid bilayer (32Seelig A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33Smaby J.M. Momsen M. Kulkarni V.S. Brown R.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5696-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Therefore, Aβ(1–40) should be able to insert into the lipid bilayer in which the content of cholesterol is above 30%. The same insertion experiments were performed for Aβ(1–28), and we found that Aβ(1–28) had no surface activity and thus could not induce the increase of surface pressure for different phospholipid monolayers (data not shown). This may be the result of the hydrophilic property of Aβ(1–28) which prevents the peptide from inserting into the monolayers. To confirm whether Aβ(1–40) could insert into lipid bilayer, papain as a protease was used to hydrolyze Aβ after it reacted with lipid vesicles, and the hydrolysis products were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectrum, which was used to determine the hydrolysis fragments (indicated by m/z), obtained for free Aβ (without vesicles), was analyzed at first. The spectrum is shown in Fig. 3, and the peaks identified by MS are summarized in TableI. From Table I we can see that papain treatments only result in a partial hydrolysis of potential sites of cleavage, which may be the result of some second structure of Aβ preventing more cleavage. In the spectra only the peaks with anm/z value higher than 1,000 are exhibited because the substances in matrix (such as CCA and its contaminants giving peaks at low m/z) can cause interference at lowm/z. Some non-papain cleavage fragments in TableI may be the result of the broken peptide because some peptide bonds may be readily broken during flying in the MS experiments.Table IResults of hydrolysis of Aβ by papainNo.Cleavage sitesFragmentM + H+ (m/z)CalculatedBy MALDI1Arg5-His6, Gly25-Ser266HDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVG252,314.082,314.112Arg5-His6, Gly25-Ser266HDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVG252,336.08+(Na)2,336.013Gly33-Leu341DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIG333,672.783,672.454Gly37-Gly381DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVG374,072.994,072.835Lys16-Leu171DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQK161,954.871,954.8061DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVF192,314.092,314.1171DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVF192,336.09 (+Na)2,336.01820FAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV402,033.072,032.92920FAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV402,055.07 (+Na)2,055.08101DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFF202,461.162,461.02111DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFF202,483.16 (+Na)2,483.131221AEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVV401,885.991,885.8313His13-His141DAEFRHDSGYEVH131,561.661,561.5414His6-Asp7, Gly25-Ser267DSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVG252,177.022,177.0015His6-Asp7, Gly25-Ser267DSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVG252,199.02 (+Na)2,199.0816Gly37-Gly3820FAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVG371,777.911,777.7517Gly37-Gly3820FAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVG371,799.91 (+Na)1,799.8918Tyr10-Glu11, Gly25-Ser2611EVHHQKLVFFAEDVG251,777.88 (+Na)1,777.7519Arg5-His6, Lys16-Leu176HDSGYEVHHQK161,358.60 (+Na)1,359.3220Tyr10-Glu11, Gly37-Gly3811EVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVG372,933.51 (+Na)1-aMet is oxidized.2,933.30The hydrolysis lasted for 40 min after the addition of papain into Aβ solution, and then iodoacetamide was injected to end the reaction.

The MALDI-TOF MS spectra of the hydrolysis products for Aβ reacting with DMPC and 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC vesicles are shown in Fig. 4. For reaction with DMPC vesicles the MS peaks are nearly identical with that of free Aβ. This result provides evidence that papain can approach nearly all cleavage sites as for free Aβ, indicating that Aβ does not insert into such lipid vesicles. In contrast, after reaction with 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC vesicles, as shown in Fig. 4 B, the characteristic peaks of the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of Aβ have a considerable change. Several fragments that could be obtained from free Aβ have disappeared here, such as the peaks of m/z 2,932, 3,672, and 4,072. By comparing the difference in the spectra among them in Fig. 4, we can find that the inaccessible cleavage sites are Gly33-Leu34 and Gly37-Gly38. Both sites are located in the C-terminal region of Aβ. This phenomenon can be explained as their locus in the membrane insertion part of Aβ, which protects them from being cleaved by papain. These results lead to the conclusion that Aβ indeed inserts into the rich cholesterol-containing vesicles by its C-terminal domain. The same experiments were performed also for Aβ(1–28), and no such effect was found (data not shown). This may be evidence that no membrane insertion occurs for Aβ(1–28). Whether there is a conformational change of Aβ during membrane insertion is a crucial question because the conformation of Aβ may be related to its aggregation (17Inouye H. Fraser P.E. Kirschner D.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 502-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Here CD spectroscopy was employed to measure the secondary structure change. Before the CD measurement a pre-experiment was performed to determine the critical molar ratio for Aβ binding, which is defined as the minimal ratio of lipid to Aβ for maximal binding of Aβ to lipid vesicles. In the present case the critical molar ratio of lipid to Aβ of about 50 was obtained. Thus in the following measurements we choose 100 as the actual lipid:Aβ ratio to assure enough lipid. Fig. 5 shows three CD spectra acquired from lipid-free Aβ, Aβ reacted with DMPC, and with 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC vesicles. The CD spectrum of lipid-free Aβ is typical of a peptide containing significant random-coil content. The computer fit results show that lipid-free Aβ consists of 48.9% random-coil, 23.5% β-sheet, and 1.7% α-helix. The results are consistent with the reports of Terzi et al.(1Terzi E. Hölzemann G. Seelig J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 34Terzi E. Hölzemann G. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14845-14852Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The addition of DMPC and 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC vesicles leads to a remarkable alteration in the CD curves as also shown in Fig. 5, indicating that Aβ undergoes a significant conformational change. According to the computer fit results one can see that in the case of the addition of DMPC vesicles, both contents of β-sheet and α-helix have about a 7% increase, i.e. the β-sheet increased to 31.2% and α-helix to 9.5%. In contrast, when 33% cholesterol-containing DMPC vesicle was added, the structure of Aβ altered drastically. The β-sheet structure decreased to zero, and the α-helix increased remarkably to 58.8%. Such results indicate that membrane insertion of Aβ eliminates its β-sheet structure and induces its α-helices. In addition, the effect of pH on Aβ secondary structure was tested by means of CD. First, Aβ in solution with different pH was measured, and the result (data not shown) indicated that pH had a certain influence on the Aβ secondary structure, which was similar to that of McLaurin and Chakrabartty's work (35McLaurin J. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26482-26489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Then the conformations of Aβ after reacting with cholesterol-rich vesicles at different pH were measured (data not shown). The results showed that little influence could be observed, indicating that the final state of membrane inserted Aβ was not sensitive to pH, which is not the case of Aβ in solution. The above measurements were performed also for Aβ(1–28), and the results (data not shown) show that there is almost no conformational change induced by lipid vesicl"

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there exist five peroxiredoxins, among which Tsa2p shares striking homology with the well described Tsa1p but has not been extensively studied. Here we report on the functional characterization of yeast tsa2Δ mutants and the comparison ofTSA1 with TSA2. The tsa2Δ andtsa1Δ tsa2Δ cells grew normally under aerobic conditions. However, the tsa1Δtsa2Δ mutant yeast was more susceptible to oxidants than either tsa1Δ or tsa2Δ cells. Notably, thetsa1Δ tsa2Δ yeast was also hypersensitive to peroxynitrite and sodium nitroprusside. This phenotype was rescued by the expression of either the TSA1 or TSA2gene. The demonstration of a peroxynitrite reductase activity of Tsa2pin vitro points to a pivotal role for peroxiredoxins in the protection against nitrosative stress. In yeast cells, Tsa1p and Tsa2p exhibited comparable antioxidant activity. While the basal expression level of TSA1 was significantly higher than that ofTSA2, the transcription of TSA2 was stimulated more potently by various oxidants. In addition, TSA2 was activated in tsa1Δ cells in a Yap1p-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings implicate the cooperation of Tsa1p and Tsa2p in the cellular defense against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species."

However, the emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants in such patients has limited the efficacy of combination chemotherapy. HIV-1 variants resistant to any of the currently available antiretroviral therapeutics have emerged both in vitro and in vivo (1Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). In particular, HIV-1 resistant to one PI is often cross-resistant to another PI, presenting formidable challenges in the therapy of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, HIV-1 protease has been shown to tolerate extensive sequence variations, remaining functional even with as many as 15 amino acid substitutions accumulated in a molecule composed of 99 amino acids (2Yoshimura K. Kato R. Yusa K. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Nguyen A. Mimoto T. Ueno T. Shintani M. Falloon J. Masur H. Hayashi H. Erickson J. Mitsuya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Salzman N.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6662-6670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those substitutions are believed to compensate for the enzymatic impairment of protease per se resulting from the acquisition of PI resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions within the protease-encoding region of the HIV-1 genome. However, a number of highly PI-resistant HIV-1 variants lack such cleavage site amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, recombinant HIV-1 clones to which PI resistance-conferring substitutions in the protease-encoding region were introduced are known to often fail to propagate in vitro (6Rose R.E. Gong Y.F. Greytok J.A. Bechtold C.M. Terry B.J. Robinson B.S. Alam M. Colonno R.J. Lin P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1648-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Therefore, we thought that as yet unidentified amino acid substitutions in the Gag-Pol polyprotein, the substrate for the enzyme, compensate for the altered enzymatic function caused by the acquisition of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease. To this end, we generated PI-resistant HIV-1 variants by exposing HIV-1 to four different PIs including amprenavir (APV) (7Yoshimura K. Kato R. Kavlick M.F. Nguyen A. Maroun V. Maeda K. Hussain K.A.

We conclude that Gag amino acid substitutions such as H219Q and R409K, located outside the cleavage sites, contribute to the development of HIV-1 resistance to PIs and are essential for the replication of HIV-1 variants in the presence of PIs.DISCUSSIONThe role and impact of amino acid substitutions in thegag gene of HIV-1 genome which emerge during therapy with protease inhibitors in patients with AIDS have been poorly understood. This is mainly due to the findings that most of the amino acid substitutions detected in the gag gene are not seen in common among clinical HIV-1 strains isolated from patients and even among HIV-1 clones generated from HIV-1 of a single patient. More problematic is that the functions and tertiary structures of HIV-1 Gag proteins remain largely to be determined. In the present study, we used a single HIV-1 clone obtained from newly transfected COS-7 cells, HIV-1NL4-3, as a starting HIV-1 strain and propagated it in the presence of increasing concentrations of four different PIs, APV, JE-2147, KNI-272, and UIC-94003 over 27–62 passages; and we studied 14 mutations identified in Gag (Table I), among which 9 mutations were seen in more than two PI-exposed HIV-1 preparations. We focused on six major Gag amino acid substitutions, L75R, H219Q, V390D/V390A, R409K, L449F, and E468K in the present study (Table I).When HIV-1 was passaged under APV pressure, L75R and H219Q mutations in the Gag protein emerged prior to the emergence of protease mutations, and we found that such Gag mutations were indispensable for the efficient replication of APV resistant HIV-1 (HIV-1AR). We thought that Gag polyprotein containing L75R or H219Q would be more sensitive to the cleavage by mutant protease because such a protease has impaired enzymatic activity due to the accumulation of amino acid substitutions within itself. Indeed, HIV-1AR whose mutantgag gene was substituted with a wild type gaggene (but with the mutant protease being intact) (HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390) failed to replicate (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with prior studies (6Rose R.E. Gong Y.F. Greytok J.A. Bechtold C.M. Terry B.J. Robinson B.S. Alam M. Colonno R.J. Lin P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 2002; 76 (in press): 1349-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, Western blot analysis showed that the polyprotein cleavage pattern was comparable between the replication-incompetent clonal HIV-1 with wild type Gag (e.g.HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390) and the HIV-1 that recovered replication competence with amino acid substitutions in Gag (e.g. HIV-1ARL75R/H219Q/V390). It is possible that the difference in the Gag polyprotein processing is functionally significant but is not readily detected with Western blot analysis (8Kageyama S. Mimoto T. Murakawa Y. Nomizu M. Ford H., Jr. Shirasaka T. Gulnik S. Erickson J. Takada K. Hayashi H. Broder S. Kiso Y. Mitsuya H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 810-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is also possible that such amino acid substitutions in Gag facilitate certain functions of Gag proteins such as assembly, packaging, and budding functions, and the recovery of polyprotein cleavage is not required.There are several lines of evidence suggesting that trimerized matrix proteins (MAs) serve as a fundamental building block for the formation of the MA shell within the mature HIV-1 (19Turner B.G. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The x-ray structural analysis of HIV-1 MA suggests that residues Pro-66 and Gly-71, which are highly conserved, function as “hinges” that allow a structural reorientation of MA at the trimer interface and that Ser-72 and Leu-75 have a tight interaction, and when the distance between these amino acids changes, the conformational interconversion of Gag occurs (22Massiah M.A. Worthylake D. Christensen A.M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Summers M.F. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2391-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Yu et al. (23Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) constructed a mutant HIV-1 with a wild type protease lacking 10 Gag amino acids (codons 68–77), which showed an impaired viral production, suggesting that that stretch of amino acids is essential for the replicative fitness of HIV-1. In the present study, the L75R substitution in Gag conferred replication advantages on HIV-1, particularly when combined with H219Q substitution. Taken together, one can speculate that the L75R substitution may alter the trimerization of MA and/or the interaction of MA with a lipid membrane of HIV-1 resulting in its “membrane anchoring” through altered electrostatic interactions. Such changes, with HIV-1AR background, may ultimately confer a replication advantage on the virus.The H219Q substitution in p24 was identified in all clones derived from four PI-resistant HIV-1 variants. In this regard, the amino acids 217–225 reportedly made a single exposed loop in the capsid protein that binds to the enzymatic active site of human CypA (24Gamble T.R. Vajdos F.F. Yoo S. Worthylake D.K. Houseweart M. Sundquist W.I. Hill C.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 1285-1294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) whose incorporation into HIV-1 particles seems to be indispensable for the infectivity of HIV-1. In fact, HIV-1 replication is inhibited by cyclosporin A that binds to CypA and interferes with the virion association of CypA (20Braaten D. Franke E.K. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Braaten D. Aberham C. Franke E.K. Yin L. Phares W. Luban J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5170-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been noted that SIVmac capsid protein also has an exposed loop but has no affinity to CypA and is capable of replicating without CypA (25Bukovsky A.A. Weimann A. Accola M.A. Gottlinger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10943-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, the transfer of the HIV-1 loop to the corresponding position in SIVmac results in the efficient incorporation of CypA and confers HIV-1-like sensitivity to cyclosporin A (25Bukovsky A.A. Weimann A. Accola M.A. Gottlinger H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10943-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yoo et al. (26Yoo S. Myszka D.G. Yeh C. McMurray M. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) generated a number of mutant p24 proteins, analyzed their binding affinity to CypA, and showed that the H219Q mutation in Gag of HIV-1NL4-3diminished CypA binding. It should be noted that H219Q represents a polymorphic amino acid substitution and is often seen particularly in clades F and G isolates (27Kuiken C. Foley B. Hahn B., P., M. McCutchan F. Mellors J. Mullins J. Wolinsky S. Korber B. Bradac J. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1999: 201-298Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that His-219 in HIV-1NL4-3 obtained from freshly transfected COS-7 cells spontaneously changed to glutamine over 10 passages in one of three independent experiments. In the two other experiments, A224V and V218M emerged when the H219Q substitution did not emerge, whereas no mutations occurred in common among clones in other regions of the entire gag gene (Table II). These data strongly suggest that the H219Q substitution brings about a conformational change in the loop formed by the stretch of the amino acids positioned 217–225 (corresponding to CypA binding loop).Based on these data, we postulated that the exposed loop of p24 might exert a negative effect(s) on the replication of HIV-1 either at the stages of assembly or disassembly and that the binding of CypA to the loop might induce conformational changes so that the negative effect(s) are canceled, thus restoring replicative fitness. Therefore, we compared the amounts of viral particle-associated CypA in H219Q-carrying and H219Q-lacking HIV-1 (HIV-1ARL75R/H219Q/V390 and HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390, respectively) using the Western blot assay, and we found that HIV-1ARL75R/H219Q/V390 contained less CypA (Fig. 6) but replicated faster than HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390 (Fig. 2, A andF). These data suggest that H219Q substitution changed the loop conformation so that the rate of replication became greater and presumably relatively independent of the binding of CypA. Indeed, in our preliminary structural characterization of HIV-1 matrix-capsid antigens, the N terminus of capsid antigen appears to take multiple conformations. 4C. Tang and M. F. Summers, unpublished data. It is possible that the cleavage of matrix and capsid antigens shifts the equilibrium toward a certain conformation (28Dietrich L. Ehrlich L.S. LaGrassa T.J. Ebbets-Reed D. Carter C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4721-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and CypA binding is required for the stabilization of that conformation. In this respect, the H219Q substitution per se might stabilize that conformation, and the requirement of CypA binding is reduced. It is worth noting that Western blot analysis has a limited utility in quantification and that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or its related method should enable us to quantitate more precisely the levels of virion-associated cyclophilin A than Western blot analysis. However, to date, no cyclophilin-specific monoclonal antibody has been generated or reported, and the establishment of a more quantitative method for cyclophilin A is awaited for further detailed investigation into the role of cyclophilin A in the replication of HIV-1.Following the emergence of protease gene mutations in HIV-1NL4-3 propagated in the presence of APV, two substitutions R409K and E468K emerged in the Gag protein. Both codons at 409 and 468 are known to be highly conserved (27Kuiken C. Foley B. Hahn B., P., M. McCutchan F. Mellors J. Mullins J. Wolinsky S. Korber B. Bradac J. Human Retroviruses and AIDS. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM1999: 201-298Google Scholar). A newly generated HIV-1 clone carrying these two mutations in addition to the cleavage site mutation L449F (HIV-1ARR409K/L449F/E468K) predominated two HIV-1 clones lacking either of these two mutations in the presence of APV in the replication kinetics assay and the CHRA (Fig. 7 B and Fig. 8, C andD). In contrast, HIV-1 carrying these two mutations and wild type protease (HIV-1NLR409K/L449/E468K) was outgrown by HIV-1 lacking the two mutations (HIV-1NLR409/L449/E468) (Fig.8 E). Based on these data, we thought that these two mutations altered the conformation of the tertiary structure of the Gag precursor p7-p1-p6 and made the cleavage site more accessible to the mutated protease, the rate-limiting step for virus maturation (29Darke P.L. Nutt R.F. Brady S.F. Garsky V.M. Ciccarone T.M. Leu C.T. Lumma P.K. Freidinger R.M. Veber D.F. Sigal I.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, Western blot analysis failed to reveal the difference in Gag cleavage profiles. There is a possibility that the functions of Gag proteins are altered by L75R, H219Q, R409K, or E468K substitutions, resulting in enhanced viral replication. One of known Gag functions is the packaging of genomic RNA into HIV-1 particles (19Turner B.G. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Therefore, we semi-quantified the amount of viral particle-associated genomic RNA in five different clonal HIV-1 preparations (HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390/R409K/L449F/E468K, HIV-1ARL75R/H219Q/V390/R409K/L449F/E468K, HIV-1JRL75/H219/V390/R409K/L449/E468, HIV-1JRL75/H219Q/V390/R409K/L449/E468, and HIV-1NLL75/H219/V390/R409/L449/E468) using Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5) and RT-PCR (Table III), but the amounts of RNA were all comparable.Most of the Gag mutations identified in this study have not been reported to be associated with the acquisition of HIV-1 resistance against PIs. For example, R409K occurred when HIV-1NL4-3was passaged in the presence of all four PIs, APV, JE-2147, KNI-272, and UIC-94003 (Table I). However, we failed to identify R409K in any of ∼30 clones generated from each of four heavily PI-treated HIV-1-infected patients whose HIV-1 was proved to harbor a number of mutations in the protease-encoding gene (2Yoshimura K. Kato R. Yusa K. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V. Nguyen A. Mimoto T. Ueno T. Shintani M. Falloon J. Masur H. Hayashi H. Erickson J. Mitsuya H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8675-8680Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It appears that the R409K substitution occurs specifically with the HIV-1NL4-3genetic background. In all the selection experiments in this study, we used a newly generated HIV-1NL4-3, a highly pure clonal HIV-1 preparation, which enabled us to identify such a mutation after drug selection procedure. In this context, it is likely that HIV-1 in patients represents the quasi-species carrying a myriad of genetic backgrounds and, in response to PI(s) including APV, HIV-1 develops a number of genetic background-specific Gag mutations, so that sequencing analyses of relatively few clones (i.e. ∼30 clones in our study) failed to identify common mutations.The present data, taken together, suggest that HIV-1 resistance to PIs is associated with primary and secondary mutations in the viral protease and is also associated with the cleavage site amino acid substitutions in Gag together with substitutions at non-cleavage sites. Such non-cleavage site Gag mutations should render the polyprotein cleavage sites more accessible to the protease, make polymerization of viral proteins more efficacious, and/or make assembly and disassembly more efficient. Alteration(s) of other unknown functions of Gag proteins may also contribute to the HIV-1 acquisition of resistance to PIs, but it appears that HIV-1 resistance to PIs is acquired with multiple mechanisms.

HIV-1 variants resistant to any of the currently available antiretroviral therapeutics have emerged both in vitro and in vivo (1Mitsuya H. Erickson J. Merigan T.C. Bartlet J.G. Bolognesi D. Textbook of AIDS Medicine. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 751-780Google Scholar). In particular, HIV-1 resistant to one PI is often cross-resistant to another PI, presenting formidable challenges in the therapy of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, HIV-1 protease has been shown to tolerate extensive sequence variations, remaining functional even with as many as 15 amino acid substitutions accumulated in a molecule composed of 99 amino acids (2Yoshimura K.

Those substitutions are believed to compensate for the enzymatic impairment of protease per se resulting from the acquisition of PI resistance-conferring amino acid substitutions within the protease-encoding region of the HIV-1 genome. However, a number of highly PI-resistant HIV-1 variants lack such cleavage site amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, recombinant HIV-1 clones to which PI resistance-conferring substitutions in the protease-encoding region were introduced are known to often fail to propagate in vitro (6Rose R.E.

Therefore, we thought that as yet unidentified amino acid substitutions in the Gag-Pol polyprotein, the substrate for the enzyme, compensate for the altered enzymatic function caused by the acquisition of amino acid substitutions in the viral protease. To this end, we generated PI-resistant HIV-1 variants by exposing HIV-1 to four different PIs including amprenavir (APV) (7Yoshimura K. Kato R. Kavlick M.F. Nguyen A. Maroun V. Maeda K. Hussain K.A.

We conclude that Gag amino acid substitutions such as H219Q and R409K, located outside the cleavage sites, contribute to the development of HIV-1 resistance to PIs and are essential for the replication of HIV-1 variants in the presence of PIs. DISCUSSIONThe role and impact of amino acid substitutions in thegag gene of HIV-1 genome which emerge during therapy with protease inhibitors in patients with AIDS have been poorly understood. This is mainly due to the findings that most of the amino acid substitutions detected in the gag gene are not seen in common among clinical HIV-1 strains isolated from patients and even among HIV-1 clones generated from HIV-1 of a single patient. More problematic is that the functions and tertiary structures of HIV-1 Gag proteins remain largely to be determined. In the present study, we used a single HIV-1 clone obtained from newly transfected COS-7 cells, HIV-1NL4-3, as a starting HIV-1 strain and propagated it in the presence of increasing concentrations of four different PIs, APV, JE-2147, KNI-272, and UIC-94003 over 27–62 passages; and we studied 14 mutations identified in Gag (Table I), among which 9 mutations were seen in more than two PI-exposed HIV-1 preparations. We focused on six major Gag amino acid substitutions, L75R, H219Q, V390D/V390A, R409K, L449F, and E468K in the present study (Table I).When HIV-1 was passaged under APV pressure, L75R and H219Q mutations in the Gag protein emerged prior to the emergence of protease mutations, and we found that such Gag mutations were indispensable for the efficient replication of APV resistant HIV-1 (HIV-1AR). We thought that Gag polyprotein containing L75R or H219Q would be more sensitive to the cleavage by mutant protease because such a protease has impaired enzymatic activity due to the accumulation of amino acid substitutions within itself. Indeed, HIV-1AR whose mutantgag gene was substituted with a wild type gaggene (but with the mutant protease being intact) (HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390) failed to replicate (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with prior studies (6Rose R.E.

However, Western blot analysis showed that the polyprotein cleavage pattern was comparable between the replication-incompetent clonal HIV-1 with wild type Gag (e.g.HIV-1ARL75/H219/V390) and the HIV-1 that recovered replication competence with amino acid substitutions in Gag (e.g. HIV-1ARL75R/H219Q/V390). It is possible that the difference in the Gag polyprotein processing is functionally significant but is not readily detected with Western blot analysis (8Kageyama S. Mimoto T. Murakawa Y. Nomizu M.

Maturation of integrin pro-αvchain (pro-αv) involves its cleavage by proprotein convertases (PC) to form the disulfide-bonded 125-kDa heavy and 25-kDa light α chains. Our report presents evidence of an alternative pathway of pro-αv processing involving MT1-MMP. In breast carcinoma MCF7 cells deficient in MT1-MMP, pro-αv is processed by a conventional furin-like PC, and the mature αv integrin subunit is represented by the 125-kDa heavy chain and the 25-kDa light chain commencing from the N-terminal Asp891. In contrast, in cells co-expressing αvβ3 and MT1-MMP, MT1-MMP functions as an integrin convertase. MT1-MMP specifically cleaves pro-αv, generating a 115-kDa heavy chain with the truncated C terminus and a 25-kDa light chain commencing from the N-terminal Leu892.

By linking the ECM with the cytoskeleton, integrins regulate cell adhesion, motility, contractility, and invasion (4Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin.

The integrins are composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits that combine to form about 25 different receptors. Among all known integrins, αvβ3 plays a unique functional role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (6Brooks P.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1996; 32: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (181) Google Scholar).It has been established that certain mature integrin subunits including α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, α8, α9, αv, αIIb, and αE are generated by post-translational endoproteolytic cleavage of the respective precursors. The cleavage at the highly conserved pairs of basic amino acids is a redundant function of proprotein convertases (PC) from the subtilisin/kexin family. PC cleavage converts single chain α precursors into respective mature subunits consisting of an N-terminal heavy chain and a C-terminal light chain connected by a disulfide bridge (7Lissitzky J.C.

Furin, a member of the PC family, has been specifically implicated in the cleavage of pro-α5, -α6, and -αv chains (7Lissitzky J.C. Luis J. Munzer J.S. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chretien M. Marvaldi J.

J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of this cleavage in integrin function is unclear. Arguably, post-translational maturation by proteolytic cleavage of the α chain is not required for ligand binding and cell adhesion but is essential to “outside-in” signal transduction by integrins (9Berthet V. Rigot V. Champion S. Secchi J. Fouchier F. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33308-33313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F.

Thus, inhibition of pro-αv cleavage by overexpression of α1-antitrypsin Portland, a furin inhibitor, impaired integrin αvβ5-mediated signal transduction and spreading in adenocarcinoma HT29-D4 cells (9Berthet V.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33308-33313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In addition to integrins, tumor cells are believed to exploit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to cross the ECM barriers. MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases shown to degrade the ECM (11Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP belongs to a subfamily of MMPs, which are distinguished by a transmembrane domain that anchors the molecule to the plasma membrane. It has been suggested that the principal function of MT1-MMP is to mediate the activation pathway of soluble MMPs including MMP-2 and MMP-13 (12Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L.

Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, αvβ3 integrin has been demonstrated to bind and localize activated MMP-2 to discrete regions of invasive melanoma cells (24Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T.

Cancer. 2000; 87: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Our study demonstrated that in addition to the breakdown of the ECM and activation of soluble MMPs, MT1-MMP functions as an integrin convertase. We show that in breast carcinoma MCF7 cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin and MT1-MMP, the protease is directly involved in the endoproteolytic cleavage of pro-αv. This alternative processing of pro-αv generates αvβ3integrin that is superior relative to conventional αvβ3 integrin in promoting cell adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation (43Deryugina, E. I., Ratnikov, B. I., Postnova, T. I., Rozanov, D. V., and Strongin, A. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, other integrin α chains, which undergo PC-mediated maturation, were also sensitive to cleavage by MT1-MMP. Our results suggest that MT1-MMP-mediated integrin processing may be a general mechanism by which cells selectively regulate the functionality of integrins. This novel regulatory mechanism of integrin function underscores the significance and complexity of interactions between MT1-MMP and cell adhesion receptors in tumor cells.DISCUSSIONEmerging evidence indicates that membrane-tethered MMPs such as MT1-MMP are directly involved in endoproteolytic modifications of cell surface receptors, including CD44, tissue transglutaminase, and αvβ3 integrin (16Deryugina E.I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), enabling cells to adjust the receptor profile in the continually changing ECM environment. Our work identifies a novel functional link between MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin and demonstrates for the first time that, similarly to furin, MT1-MMP is able to specifically cleave pro-αv in tumor cells. This cleavage appears to occur at two distinct sites localized within a loop between the disulfide-bonded Cys852 and Cys904 of pro-αv. Cleavage at these sites was found to generate a 115-kDa heavy chain and a light chain commencing from the N-terminal Leu892. Relative to the PC-processed αvsubunit species, the MT1-MMP-processed heavy α chain is C-terminally truncated, and the light α chain is one residue shorter from its N terminus. Accordingly, PC processing of pro-αv at Asp891 should prevent MT1-MMP cleavage at Leu892 and vice versa. The loop bordered by Cys852 and Cys904 contains a putative glycosylation site at the Asn874. The loss of the glycosyl component in addition to the deletion of the C-terminal peptide sequence can explain the 10-kDa size difference between the 115-kDa heavy chain processed by MT1-MMP and the 125-kDa PC-processed heavy chain of the αv integrin subunit.It appears that MT1-MMP is capable of processing other PC-cleavable α integrin subunits such as α3 and α5. The α chains that are resistant to PC cleavage (such as the α2 integrin chain) are also resistant to MT1-MMP (TableI). Relatively broad cleavage specificity of MT1-MMP is largely defined by the presence of a hydrophobic residue at the P1′ position of the scissile bond (39Ohkubo S. Miyadera K. Sugimoto Y. Matsuo K. Wierzba K. Yamada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This may explain the ability of MT1-MMP to hydrolyze those multiple α integrin chains that bear a hydrophobic residue at the P1′ position. Processing of α integrin subunits by MT1-MMP observed in MCF7 cells was confirmed in glioma U251 cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin and MT1-MMP.Table IThe putative cleavage site of MT1-MMP in α integrinsCleavage siteIntegrinKRD⇓LALαvRRQ↓LDPα3KRE↓APSα5KRE↓ITEα6RRE↓LEPα7KRD↓VHVα8RKV↓LDCα9KRE QQVα2⇓ indicates the scissile bond hydrolyzed by MT1-MMP in the αv integrin chain. ↓ indicates the putative scissile bond susceptible to MT1-MMP in the sequence of PC-cleavable α integrins. According to Fig. 4 C, PC-resistant α2 appears to be insensitive to MT1-MMP. Hydrophobic residues at P1′ are underlined. Open table in a new tab The processing of pro-αv by MT1-MMP did not affect the ability of αvβ3 integrin to efficiently bind the RGD ligand. Our findings support the hypothesis that in migrating aggressive tumor cells overexpressing MT1-MMP novel, additional portions of the mature αv integrins generated from pro-αv via the MT1-MMP pathway will co-localize with this proteinase, apparently, at the invasive cell front and the cell protrusions, the right place to additionally promote cell invasiveness.Adhesive function of integrins has been associated with the transduction of biochemical signals into the interior of the cell (40Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation normally induces outside-in signaling and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including focal adhesion kinase (41Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) that specifically modulates integrin-mediated cell migration (42Xu F. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, MT1-MMP-mediated processing of pro-αv-stimulated outside-in signal transduction through focal adhesion kinase (43Deryugina, E. I., Ratnikov, B. I., Postnova, T. I., Rozanov, D. V., and Strongin, A. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Accordingly, co-expression of MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin promoted cell adhesion and migration on vitronectin.Overall, our findings identified a novel, MT1-MMP-dependent pathway of αvβ3 integrin maturation. This pathway is likely to be functionally important in aggressive tumor cells overexpressing MT1-MMP. The data also suggest that matrix breakdown may not be the primary function of MT1-MMP in tumor cells. In turn, localized proteolytic control of cell receptors is unlikely for soluble MMPs, while the proteolytic regulation of cell receptors including integrins may be an important function of MT1-MMP in migrating cells. This hypothesis may partially explain a unique functional role of MT1-MMP in tumor cell migration and invasion (15Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1309-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, since the available cell systems naturally express relatively low levels of MT1-MMP activity, pro-αv, or both, the question as to whether the cleavage of pro-αv occurs in untransfected cells remains to be answered. To specifically address this question, the experiments employing transfection of cells with α1-antitrypsin Portland that inhibits processing of precursors mediated by proprotein convertases are currently under way in our laboratory.

The integrins are composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits that combine to form about 25 different receptors. Among all known integrins, αvβ3 plays a unique functional role in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (6Brooks P.C. Eur. J.

The cleavage at the highly conserved pairs of basic amino acids is a redundant function of proprotein convertases (PC) from the subtilisin/kexin family. PC cleavage converts single chain α precursors into respective mature subunits consisting of an N-terminal heavy chain and a C-terminal light chain connected by a disulfide bridge (7Lissitzky J.C. Luis J. Munzer J.S. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chretien M. Marvaldi J. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furin, a member of the PC family, has been specifically implicated in the cleavage of pro-α5, -α6, and -αv chains (7Lissitzky J.C. Luis J. Munzer J.S. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chretien M. Marvaldi J.

J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The role of this cleavage in integrin function is unclear. Arguably, post-translational maturation by proteolytic cleavage of the α chain is not required for ligand binding and cell adhesion but is essential to “outside-in” signal transduction by integrins (9Berthet V. Rigot V. Champion S. Secchi J. Fouchier F. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33308-33313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F.

Thus, inhibition of pro-αv cleavage by overexpression of α1-antitrypsin Portland, a furin inhibitor, impaired integrin αvβ5-mediated signal transduction and spreading in adenocarcinoma HT29-D4 cells (9Berthet V.

In addition to integrins, tumor cells are believed to exploit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to cross the ECM barriers. MMPs are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases shown to degrade the ECM (11Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3851) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP belongs to a subfamily of MMPs, which are distinguished by a transmembrane domain that anchors the molecule to the plasma membrane. It has been suggested that the principal function of MT1-MMP is to mediate the activation pathway of soluble MMPs including MMP-2 and MMP-13 (12Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L.

Although MT1-MMP is detectable in normal tissue, elevated functional activity of MT1-MMP is associated with malignant and metastatic tumors (11Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1999; 81: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that integrins interact with MMPs on the surface of normal and tumor cells (23Madri J.A. Graesser D. Dev. Immunol. 2000; 7: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, αvβ3 integrin has been demonstrated to bind and localize activated MMP-2 to discrete regions of invasive melanoma cells (24Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T.

In agreement, expression of integrin αvβ3 was repeatedly linked to the activation of MMP-2 in multiple tumor cell types (25Brooks P.C. Silletti S. von Schalscha T.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A.

Van Muijen G.N. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Our study demonstrated that in addition to the breakdown of the ECM and activation of soluble MMPs, MT1-MMP functions as an integrin convertase. We show that in breast carcinoma MCF7 cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin and MT1-MMP, the protease is directly involved in the endoproteolytic cleavage of pro-αv. This alternative processing of pro-αv generates αvβ3integrin that is superior relative to conventional αvβ3 integrin in promoting cell adhesion, migration, and focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation (43Deryugina, E. I., Ratnikov, B. I., Postnova, T. I., Rozanov, D. V., and Strongin, A. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Furthermore, other integrin α chains, which undergo PC-mediated maturation, were also sensitive to cleavage by MT1-MMP. Our results suggest that MT1-MMP-mediated integrin processing may be a general mechanism by which cells selectively regulate the functionality of integrins. This novel regulatory mechanism of integrin function underscores the significance and complexity of interactions between MT1-MMP and cell adhesion receptors in tumor cells. DISCUSSIONEmerging evidence indicates that membrane-tethered MMPs such as MT1-MMP are directly involved in endoproteolytic modifications of cell surface receptors, including CD44, tissue transglutaminase, and αvβ3 integrin (16Deryugina E.I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), enabling cells to adjust the receptor profile in the continually changing ECM environment. Our work identifies a novel functional link between MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin and demonstrates for the first time that, similarly to furin, MT1-MMP is able to specifically cleave pro-αv in tumor cells. This cleavage appears to occur at two distinct sites localized within a loop between the disulfide-bonded Cys852 and Cys904 of pro-αv. Cleavage at these sites was found to generate a 115-kDa heavy chain and a light chain commencing from the N-terminal Leu892. Relative to the PC-processed αvsubunit species, the MT1-MMP-processed heavy α chain is C-terminally truncated, and the light α chain is one residue shorter from its N terminus. Accordingly, PC processing of pro-αv at Asp891 should prevent MT1-MMP cleavage at Leu892 and vice versa. The loop bordered by Cys852 and Cys904 contains a putative glycosylation site at the Asn874. The loss of the glycosyl component in addition to the deletion of the C-terminal peptide sequence can explain the 10-kDa size difference between the 115-kDa heavy chain processed by MT1-MMP and the 125-kDa PC-processed heavy chain of the αv integrin subunit.It appears that MT1-MMP is capable of processing other PC-cleavable α integrin subunits such as α3 and α5. The α chains that are resistant to PC cleavage (such as the α2 integrin chain) are also resistant to MT1-MMP (TableI). Relatively broad cleavage specificity of MT1-MMP is largely defined by the presence of a hydrophobic residue at the P1′ position of the scissile bond (39Ohkubo S. Miyadera K. Sugimoto Y. Matsuo K. Wierzba K. Yamada Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This may explain the ability of MT1-MMP to hydrolyze those multiple α integrin chains that bear a hydrophobic residue at the P1′ position. Processing of α integrin subunits by MT1-MMP observed in MCF7 cells was confirmed in glioma U251 cells co-expressing αvβ3 integrin and MT1-MMP.Table IThe putative cleavage site of MT1-MMP in α integrinsCleavage siteIntegrinKRD⇓LALαvRRQ↓LDPα3KRE↓APSα5KRE↓ITEα6RRE↓LEPα7KRD↓VHVα8RKV↓LDCα9KRE QQVα2⇓ indicates the scissile bond hydrolyzed by MT1-MMP in the αv integrin chain. ↓ indicates the putative scissile bond susceptible to MT1-MMP in the sequence of PC-cleavable α integrins.

Open table in a new tab The processing of pro-αv by MT1-MMP did not affect the ability of αvβ3 integrin to efficiently bind the RGD ligand. Our findings support the hypothesis that in migrating aggressive tumor cells overexpressing MT1-MMP novel, additional portions of the mature αv integrins generated from pro-αv via the MT1-MMP pathway will co-localize with this proteinase, apparently, at the invasive cell front and the cell protrusions, the right place to additionally promote cell invasiveness.Adhesive function of integrins has been associated with the transduction of biochemical signals into the interior of the cell (40Humphries M.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation normally induces outside-in signaling and phosphorylation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including focal adhesion kinase (41Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3785) Google Scholar) that specifically modulates integrin-mediated cell migration (42Xu F. Zhao Z.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, MT1-MMP-mediated processing of pro-αv-stimulated outside-in signal transduction through focal adhesion kinase (43Deryugina, E. I., Ratnikov, B. I., Postnova, T. I., Rozanov, D. V., and Strongin, A. Y. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in pressGoogle Scholar). Accordingly, co-expression of MT1-MMP and αvβ3 integrin promoted cell adhesion and migration on vitronectin.Overall, our findings identified a novel, MT1-MMP-dependent pathway of αvβ3 integrin maturation. This pathway is likely to be functionally important in aggressive tumor cells overexpressing MT1-MMP. The data also suggest that matrix breakdown may not be the primary function of MT1-MMP in tumor cells. In turn, localized proteolytic control of cell receptors is unlikely for soluble MMPs, while the proteolytic regulation of cell receptors including integrins may be an important function of MT1-MMP in migrating cells. This hypothesis may partially explain a unique functional role of MT1-MMP in tumor cell migration and invasion (15Hotary K. Allen E. Punturieri A. Yana I. Weiss S.J. J.

The expression and function of these receptors has been extensively studied with the exception of one, FcγRIIb. While the mRNA for FcγRIIb has been detected in human monocytes, the protein has remained elusive. Studies in mouse models indicated that the macrophage FcγRIIb serves to down-regulate FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and immune complex-induced inflammation. FcγRIIb has also been shown to modulate the action of cytotoxic antibodies against tumors in mouse models. Hence, an understanding of how FcγRIIb expression is regulated is of great importance. Here we demonstrate for the first time FcγRIIb protein expression and function in human monocytes. We also report that the expression of FcγRIIb is highly up-regulated by interleukin-4, a Th2 cytokine, and that the up-regulation of FcγRIIb results in a decrease in the phagocytic efficiency of interleukin-4-treated THP-1 cells. Furthermore co-clustering FcγRIIb with FcγRIIa resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of the inositol phosphatase SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc, and phosphorylation of additional proteins around 120 and 60–65 kDa, with a concomitant attenuation of Akt activation. We, therefore, propose that FcγRIIb serves to inhibit FcγRI/IIa-mediated macrophage activation using SHIP as its effector.

Schreiber A.D. Rappaport E.F. McKenzie S.E. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), thereby complicating the detection and analysis of expression and function of FcγRIIb in these cells.

A 13-amino acid motif within the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIb termed ITIM (immunoreceptortyrosine-based inhibitory motif), confers the ability to inhibit cellular activation mediated by ITAM-bearing immunoreceptors (4Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J.R. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.-G. Webster P. Sautes C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Muta T. Kurosaki T.

The role of FcγRIIb as a negative regulator of immune cell function is demonstrated in mice genetically altered to be deficient in the expression of this receptor. Thus, FcγRIIb knockout mice display hypergammaglobulinemia and augmented IgG-mediated anaphylaxis in response to antigenic challenge (1Clynes R. Maizes J.S. Guinamard R. Ono M. Takai T. Ravetch J.V.

The inhibitory function of FcγRIIb is mediated by the inositol phosphatase SHIP (8Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), which associates with the phosphorylated ITIM of FcγRIIb via the SHIP SH2 domain (9Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 10Tridandapani S. Kelley T. Pradhan M. Cooney D. Justement L.B. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell.

Association of SHIP with FcγRIIb results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of SHIP to the cell membrane where it subsequently hydrolyzes PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 to PtdIns(3,4)P2 (9Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). PtdIns-P3 is required for binding and activation of plextrin homology domain containing molecules such as Btk, a Tec family tyrosine kinase (12Scharenberg A.M., El- Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O., Li, Z. Lin S. Gout I. Cantley L.C. Rawlings D.J. Kinet J.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), Vav, a guanine exchange factor for the low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family (13Ma A.D. Metjian A. Bagrodia S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Akt, a serine/threonine kinase involved in the protection of cells from apoptosis (14Jacob A. Cooney D. Tridandapani S. Coggeshall K.M.

SHIP consumption of PtdIns-P3 thus leads to the down-regulation of the above plextrin homology domain containing enzymes, and blocks the ensuing biologic responses. FcγRIIb has also been shown to associate with the hematopoetic cell-specific protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 both in in vitro analyses using synthetic phosphopeptides corresponding to the ITIM of FcγRIIb (16D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and in in vivo analyses by co-immunoprecipitation experiments under special conditions of cell stimulation (17Lesourne R. Bruhns P. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6327-6336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, no functional role for SHP-1 in FcγRIIb-mediated inhibition has thus far been identified. Indeed, experiments in B cells expressing chimeric receptors with the extracellular domain of FcγRIIb fused to either SHIP or SHP-1 indicated that SHP-1 plays no role in FcγRIIb-mediated inhibition of the B cell antigen receptor signaling (8Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate for the first time the presence of FcγRIIb in human monocytes using a novel anti-FcγRIIb rabbit polyclonal antibody. Interestingly, the expression of FcγRIIb in human monocytes is not constant, but is highly regulated by factors such as density of cell culture and the presence of the inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-4 in the surrounding milieu. We have further characterized the function of FcγRIIb in human monocytes and provide evidence that this receptor plays an inhibitory role in FcγR-mediated monocyte/macrophage function. Thus, co-clustering FcγRIIb with the ITAM-bearing FcγRIIa resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of SHIP, association of SHIP with Shc along with a concomitant decrease in Akt activation. Finally, we report that IL-4-induced up-regulation of FcγRIIb results in a loss of phagocytic efficiency of THP-1 cells, strongly supporting an inhibitory role for this receptor. Anti-FcγRII mAb IV.3 Fab and IV.3 intact IgG were obtained from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). Anti-CD32 mAb FLI8.26 was from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from UBI (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-SHIP rabbit polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. K. Mark Coggeshall (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK). Anti-Akt and Anti-pAkt were from New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA). Goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse IgG was from Pierce. Protein G-agarose beads were from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD).N-Glycosidase F was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-FcγRII mAb KB61 was obtained from Dr. D. Mason, Oxford, UK. Anti-FcγRIIb rabbit polyclonal antibody, Ab163, was from Dr. Jean-Luc Teillaud, and was raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIb1. All FcγRII antibodies used have been previously described (40Lyden T.W. Robinson J. Tridandapani S. Teillaud J-L. Garbe S. Osborne J. Budde P. Frey J. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). THP-1, U937 (monocytic cell lines), and Raji B cells were obtained from ATCC. IIA1.6 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Ira Mellman. The IIA1.6+IIa were obtained from Dr. Jan G. J. Van de Winkel. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 5% CO2. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were purified from buffy coats of healthy donors as described previously (18Tridandapani S. Lyden T.W. Smith J.L. Carter J.E. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20480-20487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were first isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Histopaque (Sigma). Monocytes were then purified from the PBMCs by negative selection using the MACs Monocyte Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech). PBMCs were then treated with FcR blocking reagent (hIgG), followed by a hapten-antibody mixture (mixture of monoclonal hapten-conjugated CD3, CD7, CD19, CD45RA, CD56, and anti-IgE antibodies). The labeled cells were further treated with MACS anti-hapten magnetic microbeads that were conjugated to a monoclonal anti-hapten antibody. The cells were then passed over a MACS column, and the effluent was collected as the negative fraction representing enriched monocytes. The monocytes thus purified were subsequently analyzed for purity by double labeling with CD14-phycoerthrin and CD45-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Data from 10,000 cells indicated that the isolated monocytes were >99% CD14 positive. For activation, 107cells per sample were resuspended in 100 μl of HBSS, incubated with 10 μg/ml IV.3 Fab, IV.3, or FL18 for 25 min at 4 °C. The unbound antibody was washed off, cells were resuspended again in 100 μl of HBSS and treated with F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG for the desired time periods at 37 °C. Resting and activated cells were lysed in TN1 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 3 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Postnuclear lysates were incubated overnight with the antibody of interest and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) or goat anti-mouse Ig covalently linked to agarose, depending on the immunoprecipitating antibody. Immune complexes bound to beads were washed in TN1 and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the antibody of interest, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The ECL signal was quantitated using a scanner and a densitometry program (Scion Image). The non-linearity of ECL signal and the low dynamic range of the film used was corrected by generating a calibration curve for the experiments by serial dilution of a control sample, and film exposure time was varied to include the entire range of data. To quantitate the phosphotyrosine signal in the activated samples, we first subtracted background, normalized the signal to the amount of precipitated protein, and plotted the values obtained by subtracting the value in unstimulated samples. FcγRII were immunoprecipitated from THP-1, U937, PBM, and Raji cells with a mixture of anti-FcγRII antibodies (equal amounts of AT10, KB61, and IV.3), washed in TN1 lysis buffer, and eluted by boiling in 30 μl of 0.7% SDS for 5 min. The eluates were treated with either the enzyme diluent alone or withN-Glycosidase F at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme reaction was stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Sheep RBCs (Colorado Serum, Denver, CO) were washed in PBS, and labeled overnight with 0.1 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate in PBS at 4 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with a subagglutinating dose of rabbit anti-sheep RBC IgG (Diamedix, Miami, FL) at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound IgG was removed by washing the cells with PBS. IgG-coated SRBCs described above were added to THP-1 cells in suspension, and the cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation to increase contact between SRBCs and phagocytes. The samples were prepared in duplicate and incubated for 1 h at either 4 °C to study binding, or 37 °C to study phagocytosis. All cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and mounted on slides to be viewed under a fluorescence microscope. For the phagocytosis assay, cells were subjected to brief hypotonic lysis with water to get rid of externally bound RBCs prior to fixation in paraformaldehyde. The ability of the THP-1 cells to bind IgG-coated targets was expressed as the percentage of cells that each bound three or more SRBCs (rosetting activity, Fig. 5 A). That the binding was via the Fc receptors was confirmed by the lack of binding observed with non-IgG-coated SRBCs. No binding or phagocytosis was seen in any of the samples treated with non-opsonized RBCs. Phagocytosis was measured by counting the total number of RBCs ingested by 200 THP-1 cells (phagocytic index, Fig. 5 A). The experiment was performed twice. Phagocytosis via FcγRIIa alone or via FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb was performed as described previously (39Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 157: 844-854Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells were labeled with either IV.3Fab or FLI8 antibodies for 25 min on ice. Unbound antibody was washed off in PBS and the cells were resuspended in PBS. SRBC were first fluoresceinated as described above and subsequently biotinylated withn-hydroxysuccinimidi-LC-biotin. The biotinylated SRBC were then incubated with 200 μg/ml streptavidin and washed in PBS before adding 40 μg/ml biotinylated F(ab′)2 of goat anti-mouse IgG. The SRBCs thus prepared were then mixed with mAb-labeled THP-1 cells and the phagocytosis assay was performed as described above. To assess the presence of FcγRIIb protein in human PBMs and in THP-1 and U937 monocyte-like cell lines we used a novel rabbit polyclonal antibody, Ab163, raised against the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIb (40Lyden T.W. Robinson J. Tridandapani S. Teillaud J-L. Garbe S. Osborne J. Budde P. Frey J. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3882-3889Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the extracellular and transmembrane domains are similar, the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb are largely divergent with the exception of the first 8 amino acid residues thus allowing the production of FcγRIIb-specific antibody. In these experiments FcγRII was immunoprecipitated with a mixture of anti-FcγRII mAbs, the immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting with either an FcγRIIa-specific antibody (Ab260) (Fig. 1 A, upper panel), or the anti-FcγRIIb antibody (Ab163) (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). Immunoprecipitates from Raji B cells were used as a positive control for the expression of FcγRIIb. A murine B cell line that lacks endogenous Fc receptors, IIAI.6, and its stably transfected derivative that expresses the human FcγRIIa, IIA1.6+IIa, were used as additional controls. That Ab163 does not cross-react with FcγRIIa is evident from the reactivity pattern of FcγRII immunoprecipitates from IIA1.6+IIa cells with Ab260 and Ab163; i.e. FcγRIIa in IIA1.6-IIa cells is not detected by Ab 163, while being readily recognized by Ab 260. The detection of FcγRIIa required the use of far fewer cells than did that of FcγRIIb. Hence in all experiments, immunoprecipitates from only 107 cells were used immunoblotting with Ab260, whereas 4 × 107 cells were used for immunoblotting with Ab163. Results indicated the presence of FcγRIIb in PBMs, THP-1, and U937 cells. The amount of IIb present in U937 cells appeared much lower than that in PBMs and THP-1 cells. Additionally we noted the presence of a doublet in the PBMs and Raji cells that reacted with Ab163, perhaps representing either differentially glycosylated forms and/or the b1 and b2 isoforms of the receptor; b1 migrates more slowly owing to a 19-amino acid insertion in its cytoplasmic tail (3Brooks D.G. Qiu W.Q. Luster A.D. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1369-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). THP-1 and U937 cells also exhibited the doublet after deglycosylation (see below). In the absence of glycosylation, the mobility of FcγRIIb1 differs from that of b2 in SDS-PAGE (3Brooks D.G. Qiu W.Q. Luster A.D. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 1369-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine which of the isoforms of FcγRIIb are present in monocytes, FcγRII immunoprecipitates were deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with Ab260 (Fig. 1 B, upper panel), or with Ab163 (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). Deglycosylation reduced both FcγRIIa and IIb to around 30–35 kDa, the reported size of the core proteins. Results indicated that both the b1 and b2 isoforms of FcγRIIb are present in all cells tested. The finding that both isoforms are present in U937 and Raji cells is consistent with an earlier report that demonstrated the presence of these isoforms by RT-PCR (2Cassel D.L. Keller M.A. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Schreiber A.D. Rappaport E.F. McKenzie S.E. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our data (Fig. 1 B, lower panel) also indicated that b2 is the predominant isoform expressed in PBMs and U937 cells, whereas b1 is the major isoform expressed in Raji B cells; these observations are consistent with earlier reports analyzing FcγRIIb1 and b2 mRNA levels in these cells (2Cassel D.L. Keller M.A. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Schreiber A.D. Rappaport E.F. McKenzie S.E. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 19Weinrich V. Sondermann P. Bewarder N. Wissel K. Frey J. Hybridoma. 1996; 15: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Such a distinction between the levels of expression of the FcγRIIb1 and b2 was not so evident in THP-1 cells. Previous studies have shown that Fc receptor expression is regulated by cytokines (20Guyre P.M. Morganelli P.M. Miller R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 21Pan L. Mendel D.B. Zurlo J. Guyre P.M. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar, 22Rossman M.D. Ruiz P. Comber P. Gomez F. Rottem M. Schreiber A.D. Exp. Hematol. 1993; 21: 177-183PubMed Google Scholar). However, no information exists regarding the regulation of FcγRIIb expression. Based on the fact that Th1 cytokines enhance macrophage responses while Th2 cytokines inhibit the same, we hypothesized that the above effect could be a reflection of the influence of these cytokines on the expression of activating versus inhibitory FcγR. Consistent with this notion it has long been known that treatment of monocytes with IFNγ, a Th1 cytokine, results in a significant up-regulation of the expression of the ITAM-associated FcγRI receptors (20Guyre P.M. Morganelli P.M. Miller R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Here, we undertook to analyze the effect of IL-4, a Th2 cytokine, on the expression of FcγRIIb and FcγRIIa. Thus, U937 cells were cultured in increasing concentrations of recombinant hIL-4 for 24 h (Fig.2 A). The expression of FcγRIIb and IIa in these cells was then analyzed by immunoblotting. U937 cells, which express the least amount of FcγRIIb among the monocyte-like cells tested, were chosen for this experiment as we reasoned that a regulatory effect on the expression of FcγRIIb would be more evident on a background of low level expression of the receptor. Results indicated that the presence of IL-4 had no effect on the expression of FcγRIIa (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). In contrast, the expression of FcγRIIb was significantly enhanced by all doses of IL-4 (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). The enhancing effect of IL-4 on FcγRIIb expression was also observed in PBMs (Fig.2 B) and in THP-1 cells (Fig. 5 B). During the course of our investigations we observed that the expression of FcγRIIb varied based on the density of the cell culture. To formally address this, U937 cells were seeded at the 3 densities indicated in Fig. 2 C and cultured for 24 h. FcγRII receptors were immunoprecipitated from lysates of equal number of cells from the three different cultures with the anti-FcγRII mixture described above, and probed by immunoblotting with either Ab163 (upper panel) or Ab260 (lower panel). Results indicated that as the cell density decreased, the amount of FcγRIIb decreased dramatically. Densitometry measurements of band intensities indicated that the amount of protein reactive with Ab163 was 70% reduced in lane 2, and 95% reduced in lane 3when compared with lane 1 (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, in the duplicate blot probed with Ab260 the amount of FcγRIIa remained unaltered verifying, at the very least, that all lanes were loaded with equal numbers of cells. This trend was consistently observed in three other experiments. Next we examined the function of FcγRIIb in human monocytes. FcγRIIb has been shown to serve as an inhibitory receptor when co-clustered with the B cell antigen receptor (23Coggeshall K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immuol. 2000; 245: 213-260PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory influence of FcγRIIb has been demonstrated to work via the phosphorylation and activation of the inositol phosphatase SHIP (8Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In B cells, co-clustering B cell antigen receptor and FcγRIIb up-regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP, the association of SHIP with the adapter protein Shc (24Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc itself (25Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E., Su, H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). While a direct role for FcγRIIb in human monocytes has not been established, co-transfection experiments of FcγRIIa and IIb in COS-7 cells revealed that FcγRIIb may serve to inhibit the phagocytic process initiated by FcγRIIa (26Hunter S. Indik Z.K. Kim M.K. Cauley M.D. Park J.G. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1998; 91: 1762-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence we wished to examine the signaling processes induced by co-clustering FcγRIIb with IIa. In these experiments we used either the Fab fragments of mAb IV.3 and GAM to specifically cluster FcγRIIa or IV.3 intact IgG and GAM to co-cluster FcγRIIa and IIb. The rationale for this usage is that IV.3 is of the murine IgG2b isotype that is reported to have a fairly high capability of serving as a ligand for FcγRIIb (27Warmerdam P.A.M. Van Den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Parren P.W.H.I. Westerdaal N.A.C. van de Winkel J.G.J. Capel P.J.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and could therefore potentially recruit FcγRIIb. In addition to these antibodies we also used the pan FcγRII mAb FL18.26, which interacts equally well with both FcγRIIa and IIb (28Ierino F.L. Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F.C. Hogarth P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1794-1803PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, THP-1 cells were activated by clustering the FcγRII receptors with the above antibodies, and the ensuing signaling events were analyzed. First, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP was examined in THP-1 cells that had been activated with IV.3 Fab, IV.3 intact IgG, or with FLI8.26. Results show that co-clustering FcγRIIb with IIa enhanced SHIP phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5). A reprobe of the same membrane with anti-SHIP antibody showed equal loading of SHIP in all lanes (lower panel). Asking whether the enhancement of SHIP phosphorylation by IV.3 intact IgG and FLI8.26 was a consequence of FcγRIIb-IIa co-clustering, or simply a reflection of these antibodies clustering more FcγRIIa receptors, we employed a supplementary approach clustering IIa in cells expressing no IIb. For this we used the IIA1.6 mouse B cells that lack FcγRIIb but have been stably transfected to express human FcγRIIa. These cells were activated by methods described above and the resultant SHIP phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As seen in Fig. 3 B, upper panel, in the absence of FcγRIIb, SHIP phosphorylation induced by all three antibodies was equivalent. These results strongly suggest that the enhancement of SHIP phosphorylation observed in THP-1 cells activated with IV.3 intact IgG or FLI8.26 is not a consequence of differences in the capacities of the anti-FcγRIIa antibodies to cluster FcγRIIa, but rather is likely the consequence of recruiting FcγRIIb into a complex with FcγRIIa. We next asked whether co-clustering FcγRIIb-IIa would also enhance Shc phosphorylation (25Aman M.J. Walk S.F. March M.E., Su, H.P. Carver D.J. Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and SHIP-Shc association (24Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J.E. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tridandapani S. Chacko G.W. Van Bruggen M.C.J. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 1997"
https://openalex.org/W2029106333,"Little is known about the structure of the C terminus of the human cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit (SCN5A), but disease-linked mutations within this 244-amino acid intracellular region of the channel have marked effects on channel inactivation. Here we report a structural analysis of the C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na+ channel that sheds new light on mechanisms that control its inactivation gating. Homology modeling of the SCN5A C terminus predicts predominant α-helical structure (six helices) in the proximal half of this intracellular tail but little structure in the distal half. Circular dichroism of isolated and purified C terminus supports this prediction. Whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings of wild type and mutant α subunits co-expressed with the hβ1 subunit in HEK 293 cells indicate that truncation of the distal, nonstructured, C terminus (L1921stop mutant) reduces current density but does not affect channel gating (n = 6). In contrast, truncation of the sixth helix containing a concentration of positively charged residues along with the distal C terminus (S1885stop mutant) also reduces current density but, in addition, has profound and selective effects on inactivation (no effect on activation). Channel availability is shifted (−11 ± 0.6 mV), and there is a 10-fold increase in the percentage of channels that burst (fail to inactivate) during prolonged depolarization (0.025% S1885stop (n = 7)versus 0.0028% wild type (n = 9),p < 0.005). These results suggest that the charged structured region of the SCN5A C terminus plays a major role in channel inactivation, stabilizing the inactivated state. Little is known about the structure of the C terminus of the human cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel α subunit (SCN5A), but disease-linked mutations within this 244-amino acid intracellular region of the channel have marked effects on channel inactivation. Here we report a structural analysis of the C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na+ channel that sheds new light on mechanisms that control its inactivation gating. Homology modeling of the SCN5A C terminus predicts predominant α-helical structure (six helices) in the proximal half of this intracellular tail but little structure in the distal half. Circular dichroism of isolated and purified C terminus supports this prediction.

Abriel H. Kass R.S. Sperelakis N. Cell Physiology Sourcebook. Academic Press, Inc., New York2001: 643-652Google Scholar). The Na+ channel α subunit, which forms the ion-conducting pore and contains channel gating components, consists of four homologous domains (I–IV) (4Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Each domain contains six α-helical transmembrane repeats (S1–S6), for which mutagenesis studies have revealed key functional roles (5Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Na+ channel inactivation is due to rapid block of the inner mouth of the channel pore by the cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV that occurs within milliseconds of membrane depolarization (6Stuhmer W.

NMR analysis of this inactivation linker (gate) in solution has revealed a rigid helical structure that is positioned such that it can block the pore, providing a structural explanation of the functional studies (10Rohl C.A.

Inherited mutations of the III/IV linker in the cardiac Na+ channel disrupt normal fast inactivation and cause cardiac rhythm disturbances in the Long QT syndrome (11Bennett P.B. Yazawa K. Makita N.

Subsequent analysis of additional Na+ channel mutations linked both to Long QT syndrome and another inherited arrhythmia, the Brugada syndrome, has revealed a critical and unexpected role of the C-terminal tail of the channel in the control of inactivation (14An R.H.

Point mutations in the C terminus shift the voltage dependence of inactivation, change the kinetics of both the onset of and recovery from inactivation, alter drug-channel interactions, and reduce entry of channels into an absorbing inactivated state (14An R.H.

Here we report a structural analysis of the C-terminal tail of the cardiac Na+ channel that sheds new light on mechanisms that control inactivation gating of this channel. Homology modeling of the C terminus, assuming similarity to the N-terminal domain of calmodulin, predicted that the C terminus would adopt a predominantly α-helical structure, a prediction verified by CD of a purified C terminus fusion protein. Functional studies revealed that only the proximal region of the C terminus, which contains all of the helical structure, markedly modulates channel inactivation but not activation. The distal C-terminal tail, which is largely unstructured, does not affect channel gating but affects the density of functional Na+ channels in the surface membrane. Our results suggest interactions between the structured region of the C terminus and other components of the channel protein that act to stabilize the channel in a pore-blocked inactivated state during membrane depolarization. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher or Sigma. Oligonucleotide primers used to make PCR products for the C terminus (of SCN5A) expression systems are as follows (restriction sites underlined): 5′-primer (sense), GCATACGTCCATATGGAGAACTTCAGCGTGGC, sequence beginning withSCN5A Glu1773 including an NdeI restriction site; 3′-primer (antisense), CGTCAGCTCGAGTCACACGATGGACTCACG, sequence ending withSCN5A C-terminal Val2016; and CGTCAGCTCGAGTCAAGAGCGTTGCAG, ending with Ser1920, including an XhoI restriction site and upstream stop codons. The NdeI/XhoI nucleotide segments were subcloned into corresponding sites of pET-28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). These constructs synthesize the protein with 21 additional amino acids at the N termini, including a poly(His) tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The pET-28a(+) vectors were transformed into competent BL21(DE3) (Novagen) cells containing the T7 RNA polymerase transposon and plated with kanamycin to select for the pET-28a(+) insert. Large scale (1-liter) cultures were grown at 37 °C in 2× YT (yeast extract (5 g/liter), tryptone (8 g/liter), and salt (2.5 g/liter NaCl)) medium with kanamycin sulfate (30 μg/ml; Invitrogen). Once culture optical density at 600 nm (A 600) was greater than 0.6, cells were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and further grown at 30 °C for 4 h. Bacterial pellets were resuspended and lysed in a denaturing buffer (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0), 4 ml of buffer/g of wet pellet, rocking at room temperature for 2 h. The solution was spun at 12,000 × g for 25 min at 21 °C. The supernatant was retrieved and added to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin slurry (Novagen), 1 ml of resin slurry/4 ml of lysate, and rocked at room temperature for 1 h. Resin was washed twice with 1 lysate volume with 8m urea buffer (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, pH 6.3) and spun at 1800 × g for 2 min at 21 °C, and supernatant was discarded. The wash protocol was repeated with 1 lysate volume each of 4, 2, and 0 m urea buffers (urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% laryl sulfate, 10% ethanol, pH 8.0). Beads were resuspended in 1 lysate volume of elution buffer (100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 0.05% laryl sulfate, 5% ethanol, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and rocked for 1 h at 21 °C. Beads were spun, and supernatant was recovered. Purified protein was dialyzed into a 0 mmimidazole buffer for biophysical analysis. Purified proteins were prepared as above. CD spectra were measured from 200 to 250 nm using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). All measurements were carried out at 22 °C using a 0.1-mm path length quartz cuvette. Data were acquired at a resolution of 0.5 nm, bandwidth 1 nm. Eight scans were averaged at 100 nm/min, and buffer spectra were subtracted from the raw data. A sequence homology search was done with the PSI-BLAST alignment program (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). The C terminus sequence was first used as a query to build the position-specific score matrix on the NCBI nr sequence data base with four iterations. The low complexity regions of the nr sequences have been masked using the SEG program with default parameters (23Valenzuela C. Bennett Jr., P.B. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 161-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The checkpoint file was then used in a following one-iteration run of the PSI-BLAST on the Protein Data Bank. Two families of proteins in the Protein Data Bank were identified as possible templates for the modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the first half of the C terminus peptide (from residue 1785 to 1885): the N-terminal domains of calmodulin and troponin C. These two structural domains are sequence-related and have essentially identical folding topology. The N-terminal domain of calmodulin (Protein Data Bank code 1vrk, chain A, residues 4–95 (24Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar)) is related to the C terminus peptide with a p value of 10−8, and the N-terminal domain of the troponin C (Protein Data Bank code 1a2x, chain A, residues 11–105 (25Viswanathan P.C. Bezzina C.R. George Jr., A.L. Roden D.M. Wilde A.A. Balser J.R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) is related to the C-terminal peptide with a p value of 10−6. Previous work has demonstrated that protein pairs with pvalues less that 10−6 are highly likely to adopt the same fold (26Yang A.S. Honig B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We thus have compared the query sequence with more than 10,000 protein structures before selecting the appropriate template for modeling (27Sauder J.M. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Proteins. 2000; 40: 6-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 28Orengo C.A. Bray J.E. Hubbard T. LoConte L. Sillitoe I. Proteins. 1999; 37: 149-170Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hence, we use the N-terminal domain of the calmodulin 1vrk (chain A residues 4–95) as the template to build a model structure for the first half of the C terminus peptide (residues 1785–1885). Although the template structure has two EF hands for calcium binding, many of the key acidic residues that are used for specific calcium binding in calmodulin are not conserved in the C terminus peptide, suggesting that the C terminus peptide does not bind to calcium as in calmodulin. The structure of the second half of the C terminus peptide is not known. Nevertheless, the secondary structure predictions have suggested that the structure of the second half of the C terminus peptide adopts a long helical structure plus a long tail of nonstructural region. Methods for mutagenesis of the human heart Na+ channel α subunit, transient transfection of HEK 293, and patch clamp analysis of expressed channels were as described in previous publications (29Abriel H. Cabo C. Wehrens X.H. Rivolta I. Motoike H.K. Memmi M. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Single channel currents were recorded using the cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp with the following bath solution: 140 mm KCl, 5 mmHEPES, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Electrode resistance was typically 5–7 megaohms when filled with internal solution (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After establishing the cell-attached configuration (seal resistance >10 gigaohms), the membrane was held at a holding potential of −120 mV. Test pulses (−30 mV, 100 ms) were applied every 0.5 s. The probability of bursting (Pb) is estimated by the equation,Pb = (1 − (nb/t)1/n) × 100, wherenb, t, and n represent the number of nonbursting sweeps and total sweeps and channels, respectively. Sweeps with long lasting and repetitive opening activity are defined as bursting sweeps. We used the sequence of the C terminus of SCN5A for homology modeling. Since this section of the sodium channel is naturally present intracellularly (5Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), we assumed that it would fold similarly to proteins that are entirely cytoplasmic. Fig. 1 A shows the PSI-BLAST alignment of the query sequence to the template (see “Experimental Procedures”). Secondary structure predictions of the C terminus peptide in Fig. 1 A were obtained from the servers of PSI-PRED (30Jones D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (4342) Google Scholar) and PHD (31Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). The predicted structure of the first half of the C terminus domain consists of six helices (H1–H6; Fig.2). The three-dimensional model of the first half of the C terminus peptide is shown in Fig. 1 B. Only the first five helices' three-dimensional locations can be predicted. Although the sixth, long helix is present, its relative location cannot be calculated with accuracy.Figure 2Human sodium channel homology.

Honig B. Proteins. 1999; 37: 66-72Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As expected for a cytoplasmic protein, hydrophilic residues are generally facing the outside of the structure, while hydrophobic amino acids are protected in the globular core. One particularly interesting property of this globular structure is that it has a density of acidic residues on one end (H1 and H2) and basic residues, primarily in helix H6, that are likely to be distributed on the opposite side of the structure to form a bipolar arrangement of the real charges in the structure. However, since the predicted structure does not reveal the exact positions of the basic residues in the structure, the hypothesis of the charge distribution remains to be tested. Sequence comparison betweenSCN5A and other human sodium channel isoforms (Fig. 2) reveals that those regions responsible for this suggested polarity are highly conserved, particularly the acidic rich domain, containing H1 and H2. On the other hand, the sequences of the distal half of the C-terminal domain after H6 are diverse with less conserved sequence features and extensive insertions and deletions. This is in agreement with the expectation that the distal half of the protein is not structured. If the functional properties of the C terminus are structurally dependent, then the distal half of the tail is not likely to be involved in channel gating (see below). Fig. 1 Cillustrates, in schematic format, the relationship between the α subunit C-terminal tail and other previously identified functionally relevant sequences in the protein. Two constructs of the C terminus ofSCN5A were made and subcloned into an expression vector containing a T7 viral promoter. One construct contained the entire length of the C terminus, residues 1774–2016, and the other included simply the proximal half, the region predicted to be enriched in structure, residues 1774–1920. Expressed in bacterial cells containing a viral polymerase transposon, the T7 promoter is constitutively transcribed when induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. We included an N-terminal His tag to be used for affinity purification over a nickel column. The constructs were difficult to purify under native conditions, due to insolubility of the protein as well as its sensitivity to proteolytic degradation, particularly in the case of the full-length construct. Consequently, bacterial pellets were lysed under denaturing conditions and progressively washed into more native solutions while bound to the nickel resin. This gave high yields of purified protein in solution. Protein identity was confirmed by Western analysis with both antibodies raised against the poly(His) tag as well as the C-terminal 17 amino acids of SCN5A (Fig. 3). The purification of recombinant proteins from insoluble pellets under denaturing conditions has been used previously in studies in which structures have been solved through refolding, including the glutamate receptor (33Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), a membrane protein. However, in the case of the full-length construct for the SCN5A C terminus, it was also possible to purify a very small amount of protein from the soluble fraction. CD spectra of these proteins were obtained and found to be consistent with those of the refolded proteins (data not shown). Therefore, proteins purified using the refolding method were used in the following experiments. Purified proteins were dialyzed to buffer without imidazole, since the compound is known to rotate light in the ultraviolet range. Each protein spectrum is the product of the average of eight scans minus the spectrum of the buffer solution. The CD spectra for the two constructs are shown in Fig.4. The full-length C terminus (Fig. 4,open squares) exhibits some definitive structure; however, it is not clearly dominated by any of the known secondary structures. As predicted by the computational model, the CD of the proximal half of the C terminus (Fig. 4, closed squares) is more clearly ordered and is very similar to spectra of all-helical proteins (known to have two distinct negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm (34Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar)). In order to estimate the relative secondary structure content, we employed two computer algorithms, CONTINLL and CDSSTR (35Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar, 36Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The two programs showed the full-length construct to be composed of an even mixture of α-helix and nonstructure, while the shorter construct is almost two-thirds α-helical content (TableI). These data provide biophysical evidence that supports the predicted structure of the C terminus; the proximal half is predominantly helical, and the distal half is largely unstructured.Table ICalculated secondary structure contentα-Helixβ-SheetNonstructureProgram%%%1774–188460.72.836.4CONTINLL69.313.716.4CDSSTRFull-length46.07.746.2CONTINLL48.89.142.6CDSSTR Open table in a new tab To further study the predictions of the model, we investigated the functional consequences of cleaving 1) a predicted nonstructured segment (construct L1921stop) and 2) a predicted helical portion of the C terminus along with the above unstructured region (S1885stop) using electrophysiological properties as an assay. The L1921stop mutation leaves the entire predicted structural region intact, while removing the nonstructured distal portion of the tail, and corresponds to the shorter construct studied above. Biophysical properties of channels encoded by this construct are similar to those encoded by full-length (WT)1α subunits (Fig. 5), not differing significantly from wild type in any observed property of the channel, with the exception of reduced peak current (−180.07 ± 19.7 pA/pF (n = 17) versus −403.18 ± 43.0 pA/pF (n = 21), respectively, p < 0.05). This rules out the role of the distal portion of the C terminus in channel gating. The L1885stop mutation, which cleaves positively charged residues between amino acids 1885 and 1921 and the predicted sixth helix, reduces peak currents (−266.17 ± 17.3 pA/pF (n = 37) versus −403.18 ± 43.0 pA/pF (n = 21) for WT; p < 0.05) but, in addition, changes channel gating. The S1885stop mutation shifts steady state inactivation (−73.2 ± 0.6 mV (n = 12) for mutant versus −61.9 ± 0.2 mV (n = 8) for WT, p < 0.001) and slows the recovery from inactivation (time to half-recovery 3.01 ± 0.06 ms for WT (n = 8); 5.92 ± 0.06 ms for S1885stop (n = 5), p < 0.05; not shown). Perhaps most striking, however, is the pronounced effect of this mutation on Na+ channel currents measured during prolonged depolarization (Fig. 5, arrow, S1885stop traces). As can be seen more clearly in the insetof Fig. 6 A and in the summarygraph of Fig. 6 C, this truncation induces a significant increase in sustained channel activity compared with both WT and L1921stop channels (1.78 ± 0.2 pF/pA (n = 24) for mutant versus 0.24 ± 0.05 pF/pA (n = 14) for WT, p < 0.001; 0.27 ± 0.07 pA/pF (n = 5), L1921stop), suggesting increased bursting activity in these channels. Single channel experiments reveal that this is the case (Fig.7). Shown in Fig. 7 are consecutive current traces showing activity of a small number (10Rohl C.A. Boeckman F.A. Baker C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Klevit R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 855-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) of channels in cell-attached membrane patches. Recordings from WT channels reveal few reopenings during prolonged depolarization, consistent with channels entering an absorbing inactivated state. Infrequently, however, reopenings are observed for WT channels, reflecting a low probability of entrance into a bursting mode of channel activity, even with the full-length C-terminal tail. However, bursting is observed much more frequently in the case of recordings from S1885stop channels (Fig. 7), causing a significant increase in the probability that channels burst when compared in a large number of experiments (Fig. 7). This type of channel activity, shown to be arrhythmogenic in inherited cardiac disorders (11Bennett P.B. Yazawa K. Makita N. George A.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 683-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), indicates that a significant fraction of channels no longer enter an absorbing inactivated (nonconducting) state during prolonged depolarization and underlies sustained whole cell channel activity illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6. While only a fraction of the peak channel activity, this small fraction of noninactivating channels can conduct currents that are sufficient to prolong cellular action potentials and trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias (37Schwartz P.J.

The bar graph plots bursting frequency (Pb) (see “Experimental Procedures”) for both WT and S1885stop channels. Data for bursting frequency were obtained from nine cells for WT patches and seven cells for S1885stop patches. **,p < 0.005.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have combined theoretical modeling, CD measurements, and functional expression studies to probe the structure and functional role of the C terminus of the human voltage-gated Na+channel α subunit in the control of channel gating. CD measurements provide strong support for the computational predictions of the C terminus structure, and the functional studies provide new insights into mechanisms by which these structures may contribute to the control of channel gating. The agreement between theoretical prediction and experimental measurement of the C terminus structure is strong. The CD data show that the first half of the protein is well structured and mostly helical, and the distal half of the protein is largely unstructured, supporting the predictions of the homology modeling. Because the distal half does not affect either activation or inactivation gating, our results suggest that without coordinated structure, this region of the C terminus does not interact with other channel components responsible for gating. On the other hand, the computational work suggests that the proximal half of the protein adopts a fold similar to calmodulin with the charged residues distributed in a bipolar pattern. Thus, the computational work predicts that the proximal helices may play important roles in controlling channel gating. The predicted structure reveals several observations regarding the charge distribution within the C terminus. First, similarly charged residues in general occupy positions on a common side of helices. This is particularly true in H1 and H2 as well as H6. Second, although residues of both positive and negative charge exist throughout the C terminus, helices H1 and H2 (residues 1780–1820) have a high concentration (14 of 41) of negatively charged amino acids, and H6 has a high concentration (7 of 27) of positively charged residues. Together, and depending on the precise localization of H6, this may provide for the formation of a bipolar globular structure, which may show functional significance. Functional studies provide support for this speculation and suggest that C-terminal structures play an important and specific role in controlling channel inactivation. In our experiments, truncation (S1885stop mutation) of the model-predicted sixth helix, which contains positive charges in the end of the proximal half of the C terminus, caused significant changes in inactivation but not activation gating. Most notable was a significant increase in the fraction of channels that failed to enter an absorbing inactivated state during maintained depolarization. This fraction of channels is evident as the mutation-induced increase in maintained current in Fig. 6 and the increase in bursts of single channel activity seen in Fig. 7. These changes in inactivation occur despite the fact that the voltage dependence of activation of the channel is not affected. In contrast, however, the voltage dependence of inactivation is shifted toward more negative potentials by the S1885stop mutation. This means that less energy is expended (more modest depolarization) in reducing the availability (increasing the fraction of closed state inactivated channels). Additionally, this truncation slows the recovery of channel from the inactivated state by hyperpolarization. These latter effects of the truncation of H6 are consistent with stabilization of the closed inactivated state. Thus, it appears that these experiments reveal a complex role of the C terminus helices in control of inactivation possibly by independently influencing protein conformations that underlie transitions of modal activity (bursting) of the channel and rapid gating (inactivation). Additional evidence for the importance of the proximal region of the C terminus in the control of channel inactivation comes from the analysis of inherited mutations of the Na+ channel α subunit that are linked to the cardiac rhythm disturbances, Long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. Within the last few years, several mutations linked to these diseases have been reported in this region of the Na+ channel α subunit, which has been referred to as an “acid-rich” domain (18Wei J.

All of these inherited mutations are in the acid-rich first five helices of the proximal region of the C terminus; all cause changes in channel inactivation with no reported effects on channel activation; and all disrupt normal cardiac rhythm and place mutation carriers at risk for sudden cardiac death. Fast inactivation of Na+ channels is coupled to activation of the channels (39Aldrich R.W. Corey D.P. Stevens C.F. Nature. 1983; 306: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Transitions into the inactivated state can occur following activation or opening of the channel that occurs when charged S4 segments of the four domains of the α subunit respond to membrane depolarization (40Cha A.

Inactivation of open channels develops rapidly as the intracellular peptide that links domains III and IV occludes the channel by folding and binding to a receptor in the intracellular mouth of the pore, preventing ion flow (6Stuhmer W.

Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structural analysis of the central portion of the inactivation gate as well as mutagenesis studies support the view that the inactivation gate forms a hydrophobic interaction with its receptor to occlude the pore (10Rohl C.A.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because we find that the proximal structured and charged region of the C terminus specifically modulates channel inactivation, our findings suggest that electrostatic interactions, provided by the specific distribution of the charged residues on a well defined structure, may contribute an energetic source in modulating the inactivation gating mechanism, in addition to the ball-and-chain type mechanism, where specific short range hydrophobic contacts are the major driving force in the inactivation mechanism (42Kellenberger S. West J.W. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Kellenberger S. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30971-30979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The significance of the findings is that mechanisms with completely different energetic origin could exist in parallel in controlling the gating of the channels. Elucidating the details of the mechanisms requires further experimental and computational work. We thank Dr. Virginia W. Cornish, Shalom D. Goldberg, and Dr. Geoff S.

https://openalex.org/W2160094174,"The adamalysins (ADAMs) are transmembrane glycoproteins involved in cell adhesion and proteolytic ectodomain processing of cytokines and adhesion molecules. Many ADAM cytoplasmic domains are proline-rich and have potential phosphorylation sites. We show here that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM15, metargidin, can interact specifically with Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the adaptor protein Grb2 in hematopoietic cells (Jurkat, THP-1, U937, and K562 cell lines). Src homology 3 domains from several Src family PTKs including Lck, Fyn, Abl, and Src associate with ADAM15in vitro. Dephosphorylation of cell extracts resulted in decreased association of ADAM15 with Src family PTK SH3 domains, indicating that phosphorylation influences ADAM15 interactions with its binding partners. This was confirmed in vitro for Hck, Lck, and Grb2, which showed enhanced association with tyrosine-phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-ADAM15 cytoplasmic domain compared with unphosphorylated protein. In contrast, binding of MAD2 to ADAM15 was slightly reduced by phosphorylation of the ADAM. Immunoprecipitation of ADAM15 from Jurkat cells confirmed the association with Lck in vivo, and upon PMA stimulation, the phosphorylation level of ADAM15 was increased. Cotransfection of ADAM15 and Hck showed Hck-dependent phosphorylation of ADAM15in vivo. Hck, and to a lesser extent Lck, phosphorylated the ADAM15 cytoplasmic domain in vitro in immune complex kinase assays. Binding of ADAM15 cytoplasmic domain to Hck and Lck was also shown by Far Western analysis. In contrast to Hck, Lck activity was not required for binding to ADAM15, as shown by treatment of cells with PP1. Deletion and point mutation analysis of the ADAM15 cytoplasmic domain confirmed the importance of the proline-rich motifs for Grb2 and Lck binding and indicated the regulatory nature of Tyr715 and Tyr735. These data demonstrate selective, phosphorylation-dependent interactions of ADAM15 with Src family PTKs and Grb2, which highlight the potential for integration of ADAM functions and cellular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2141589798,"The interaction of protein serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) with superoxide and hydrogen peroxide was investigated. Superoxide specifically inhibited phosphatase activity of CaN toward RII (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE) phosphopeptide in tissue and cell homogenates as well as the activity of the enzyme purified under reducing conditions. Hydrogen peroxide was an effective inhibitor of CaN at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than superoxide. Inhibition by superoxide was calcium/calmodulin-dependent. Nitric oxide (NO) antagonized superoxide action on CaN. We provide kinetic and spectroscopic evidence that native, catalytically active CaN has a Fe2+-Zn2+ binuclear center in its active site that is oxidized to Fe3+-Zn2+ by superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. This oxidation is accompanied by a gain of manganese dependence of enzyme activity.

The list of physiological CaN substrates is growing and its important role in such processes as T-cell activation, heart and skeletal muscle hypertrophy, synaptic plasticity, and apoptosis has been recognized (reviewed in Refs. 1Rusnak F.

Recent interest has been focused on CaN regulatory mechanisms beyond calcium/calmodulin, and redox events have been suggested as modulators of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation pathways (4Hancock J.T.

With regard to the H2O2 effect, we have postulated a dithiol-disulfide transformation, since inhibition of the isolated enzyme was accompanied by the disappearance of two thiol groups, and reactivation was achieved by thioredoxin and dithiols (10Bogumil R.

Furthermore, CaN activity could be blocked by phenylarsine oxide, a selective agent for vicinal dithiols at low concentrations. However, the H2O2 concentrations required for inhibition were well above 100 μm and, hence, out of a physiological range. Therefore, the previously suggested inhibition by superoxide (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) seemed to be a more relevant mechanism under physiological conditions, especially because we had obtained evidence that O2 alone or in combination with the ·NO radical can participate in a variety of signaling mechanisms (11Ullrich V.

Similarly to related phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and purple acid phosphatases, CaN contains a binuclear metal center necessary for catalysis (12Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A.

Klee and co-workers (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) suggest the existence of superoxide-sensitive ferrous iron, but on the basis of spectroscopic and kinetic studies on isolated bovine CaN it was later suggested by Rusnak and co-workers (14Yu L. Haddy A. Rusnak F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10147-10148Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Yu L. Golbeck J. Yao J. Rusnak F.

A redox-sensitive Fe3+-Fe2+ form of CaN resembling the well characterized binuclear center in bovine spleen purple acid phosphatase was artificially obtained by metal exchange (14Yu L. Haddy A.

It was hypothesized that this form could also contribute to redox sensitivity of native CaN in tissue homogenates (9Reiter T.A. Abraham R.T. Choi M. Rusnak F. J. Biol. Inorg.

However, no evidence for the existence of such form in vivo has yet been obtained. In the present work we attempted to clarify the mechanisms of CaN redox control with emphasis on the possible sensitivity of the enzyme toward O2. Here we provide data supporting the presence of the Fe2+-Zn2+ center in native, catalytically active CaN, which can be efficiently oxidized and inactivated by nanomolar O2 concentrations in a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent manner. NO acts as O2antagonist in protecting the enzyme against this inactivation. Thus, CaN joins the O2/NO regulatory system and allows a link between phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events and redox control. All chromatographic media for protein purification were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.. Xanthine oxidase (XO), catalase, and Cu,Zn-SOD were from Sigma. Stock solutions of potassium superoxide (KO2) were made in Me2SO dried over 3-Å molecular sieves, and O2 concentrations were determined by using ε260 = 2086m−1 cm−1. Bovine brain CaN was isolated according to purification procedure of Sharma et al. (18Sharma R.K. Taylor W.A. Wang J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as described in Bogumil et al. (10Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D. Schmachtel T. Hellstern S. Mutzel R. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Porcine brain CaN purification involved the following important modifications; ammonium sulfate precipitation and Affi-Gel blue chromatography steps were omitted, and calmodulin affinity chromatography peak fractions were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column. 5 mm ascorbate was included in all purification buffers before the gel filtration step to avoid oxidative inactivation of CaN. CaN purity was checked by 14% SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined by densitometry of the CaN A-subunit bands using bovine CaN as a reference. Jurkat or RAW 264.7 cells (0.5–1×106) were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 5 s), washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 75 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.2 mm EGTA, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) by three cycles of freezing-thawing in liquid N2. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. After measuring the protein with BCA reagent (Pierce), its concentration was adjusted to 0.5–1 mg/ml with the lysis buffer. Bovine cerebral cortex was homogenized in the lysis buffer using Polytron tissue dispersion (Kinematica) and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted after protein determination to 1 mg/ml with the lysis buffer. RII peptide (DLDVPIPGRFDRRVSVAAE, Bachem), corresponding to a portion of the regulatory RII subunit of protein kinase A, was serine-phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP by using the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. 20 μl of 7.8 mm RII stock solution was added to a kinase reaction mixture containing 50 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm ATP, 1 mCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 units of protein kinase A in a volume of 1 ml. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 30 °C, and the phosphorylated peptide was purified on 1-ml Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters) pre-equilibrated with 5 ml of 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid followed by 8 ml 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After loading of the reaction mixture, the column was washed excessively with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide was eluted with 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, then lyophilized and re-suspended in a total volume of 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The assay was performed essentially according to Fruman et al. (19Fruman D.A. Pai S.-Y. Klee C.B. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Methods. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The assay buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm TCEP, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6 μmRII peptide, 1 μm okadaic acid, and 0.4 mmCaCl2. To 20 μl of assay buffer an equal volume of protein diluted in lysis buffer was added, and the reaction was conducted at 30 °C for 5–10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 20% DOWEX 50-X8 (200–400 mesh, Bio-Rad) in 10% trifluoroacetic acid. The mix was centrifuged 6 min at 14,000 rpm, and 40 μl of supernatant were taken for Cherenkov counting. The amount of protein was adjusted so that the substrate consumption did not exceed 25%. Duplicate cpm values from the phosphatase assay were averaged, and the resulting value was adjusted by subtracting the counts in blanks lacking cell lysate. This was divided by the specific activity of the substrate to give picomoles of phosphate released. Finally, this was divided by the reaction time and the amount of protein to give values expressed as nmol phosphate/min/mg of protein. In the experiments with isolated CaN, 300 nm calmodulin was present in the assay, and TCEP was omitted from the buffers with no effect on CaN activity. Purified porcine CaN (1 μm) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm TCEP, and 5 mmascorbate, pH 7.5, with 0.05 μg of trypsin for 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 μg of soybean trypsin inhibitor. The reaction was diluted into lysis buffer before incubation with XO. Parallel samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE to control the extent of proteolysis. The amount of superoxide generated by the XO/hypoxanthine system was assayed by measuring the rate of SOD-inhibitable cytochrome creduction. Phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors, pH 7.5) containing 50 μm cytochromec was used, and the increase of A 550was followed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C after the addition of various XO amounts in the presence of 100 μm hypoxanthine and 200 units/ml catalase. Under these conditions 1–5 milliunits/ml XO generated 0.2–1 μm O2/min. Porcine CaN was buffer-exchanged on a Sephadex G-25 fast desalting fast protein liquid chromatography column into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (pre-treated with Chelex 100 chelating resin (Bio-Rad), to remove excess of metal ions). The metal content of the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Spurenanalytisches Laboratorium Dr. Baumann, Maxhütte, Germany). EPR spectra were recorded at 9.5 GHz (X-band) microwave frequency on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer with a dual-mode resonator and peripheral equipment described elsewhere (20Neese F. Zumft W.J. Antholine W.E. Kroneck P.M.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8692-8699Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Purified porcine CaN (with equivalent amounts of calmodulin added) was concentrated to 20 mg/ml in an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal device (Millipore). After recording the spectrum, the sample was thawed and incubated with 10 mm H2O2 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 5 min at room temperature, and the spectrum was recorded again. Brain extracts contain a variety of phosphatases requiring the use of the [32P]phosphorylated RII peptide in conjunction with PP1/2A inhibitor okadaic acid for specific assessment of CaN activity. Under these conditions the effect of O2 on CaN activity was tested by adding the XO/hypoxanthine system. Catalase (200 units/ml) was also present to block the possible effects of H2O2. At a fixed concentration of 100 μm hypoxanthine the addition of increasing amounts of XO caused a progressive inhibition of CaN activity with half-maximal inhibition at about 1 milliunit/ml XO, which corresponds to 0.2 μm O2 generated per min under assay conditions (Fig. 1 A). PP1/2A activity in the homogenate, measured as okadaic acid-sensitive [32P]phosphate release in the presence of EGTA, was not affected by XO/hypoxanthine (data not shown). The effect of O2was not restricted to brain extracts, since CaN activity in lysates from Jurkat T-lymphocytes and RAW 264.7 macrophages was inhibited by XO/hypoxanthine to a similar extent (data not shown). When bovine CaN was isolated as reported (10Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D. Schmachtel T. Hellstern S. Mutzel R. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), its activity in initial experiments, contrary to the homogenate, was found to be insensitive to inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine (data not shown). During the calmodulin affinity chromatography step in the standard procedure of CaN isolation the protein mixture was in contact with high calcium concentrations. These conditions, according to Klee and co-workers (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) could result in loss of CaN activity due to O2-dependent oxidation, and this might be responsible for the insensitivity of the isolated bovine CaN to XO/hypoxanthine system. Because ascorbate was found to be protective against oxidative inactivation (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), we carried out the purification procedure with 5 mm ascorbate addition to all buffers involved in CaN isolation. Porcine brain homogenates served as a starting material since bovine tissues were not available due to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis in Germany. We noticed that the newly isolated porcine CaN behaved differently toward stimulation with Mn2+ ions (TableI). In the presence of calmodulin the bovine enzyme was activated about 10-fold by Mn2+ in the assay with 32P-labeled RII-peptide. In contrast, Mn2+ activated the porcine enzyme only about 3-fold. The gain of Mn2+ dependence was accompanied with a loss of XO sensitivity; thus, the bovine enzyme retained about ∼25% of the activity after incubation with XO, and the porcine enzyme was inhibited to 5–10% that of controls (data not shown). 2The activity of the bovine enzyme varied from preparation to preparation, with some preparations showing about 100-fold activation by Mn2+ and only 25% inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine. Fig. 1 Bshows the concentration dependence of purified porcine CaN inactivation by the XO/hypoxanthine system. The IC50 for XO at 0.05 milliunit/ml is 10-fold lower than IC50 observed in brain homogenate, possibly reflecting O2 scavenging by other homogenate constituents.Table IActivities of isolated bovine and porcine CaNActivityBovine CaNPorcine CaNnmol P i /min/mg+ CaCl20.3 ± 0.22.6 ± 0.4+ CaCl2/CaM7.5 ± 5.272.2 ± 8.4+ CaCl2/MnCl20.8 ± 5.672.4 ± 8.0+ CaCl2/CaM/MnCl214 ± 86213.6 ± 25.6Bovine and porcine CaN were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphatase activity toward 32P-RII peptide was measured for 5 min in the presence of 200 units/ml SOD at 30 °C.

Open table in a new tab Bovine and porcine CaN were isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphatase activity toward 32P-RII peptide was measured for 5 min in the presence of 200 units/ml SOD at 30 °C. Additions: CaM, 300 nm; MnCl2, 1 mm. Data represent the means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Although the XO/hypoxanthine system is widely used for O2 generation, it also co-generates substantial amounts of H2O2. In addition, commercial XO preparations possess strong proteolytic activity. The presence of catalase, the disulfide reductant TCEP, and protease inhibitors in our assay system should minimize the effects of H2O2 and proteases. To prove that the inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine is caused by O2 the homogenate or isolated enzyme was incubated with XO and 100 μm hypoxanthine in the presence of 200 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD (Fig. 2). In both cases, SOD protected CaN against XO/hypoxanthine-mediated inhibition. Moreover, Cu,Zn-SOD also increased the basal rate of purified CaN activity. We observed that CaN was rapidly inactivated during the assay (data not shown), and SOD prevented this inactivation, thus resulting in apparent activation of the enzyme when net phosphate release during 5 min was counted. Protection exerted by SOD confirmed that O2generated by XO/hypoxanthine was the inhibitory species. Additionally, omission of catalase from the assay mixture did not alter the extent of inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine (data not shown), indicating that H2O2 generation by this system was insufficient to cause CaN inhibition. Finally, bolus additions of as low as 100 nm KO2 could significantly inhibit enzyme activity (data not shown). Although H2O2 generation by the XO system was not responsible for CaN inhibition, we (10Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D. Schmachtel T. Hellstern S. Mutzel R. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and others (8Furuke K. Shiraishi M. Mostowski H.S. Bloom E.T. J.

Chem. 1999; 4: 632-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) show that CaN could be inhibited by H2O2. To investigate the effects of H2O2 under the same conditions as for XO/hypoxanthine treatment, we incubated porcine CaN with increasing H2O2 concentrations in the presence of Ca2+, calmodulin, and Cu,Zn-SOD to exclude O2-mediated enzyme inhibition. H2O2caused a dose-dependent inhibition of activity of purified CaN (Fig. 3) with IC50 ∼ 50 μm (lower than previously found (10Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D. Schmachtel T. Hellstern S. Mutzel R. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)), confirming that H2O2 could also be a CaN inhibitory species, although its effective concentrations are about 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of O2. In the work of Wang et al. (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) a link was made between calcium and O2 dependence of CaN inactivation. In our experimental setting we added XO/hypoxanthine directly into the RII assay mixture containing 0.1 mm free Ca2+. To investigate the calcium dependence of CaN inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine, we preincubated the porcine enzyme with 2 milliunits/ml XO and 100 μmhypoxanthine in the absence and presence of 1 mmcalcium and/or 500 nm calmodulin before measuring the CaN activity with RII peptide. As shown in Fig.4, calcium/calmodulin, but not calcium alone, significantly increased the inhibitory effect of XO/hypoxanthine. Even in the absence of XO, CaN activity decreased to 50% that of control after a 10-min incubation with calcium/calmodulin. A similar dependence was observed in brain homogenates (data not shown). Altogether, these results indicated that inhibition of CaN by O2 occurs in a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent manner. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent CaN activation involves the displacement of the autoinhibitory domain from the enzyme active site, allowing substrate access to the catalytic center (21Hashimoto Y. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1924-1927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Gastinel L.N. Habuka N. Chen X. Maldonado F. Barker J.E. Bacquet R. Villafranca J.E. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). A similar activation could be achieved by limited proteolysis of CaN (23Manalan A.S. Klee C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4291-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24Yang S.A. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16147-16154Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), which removes the autoinhibitory and calmodulin-binding domains and renders the enzyme constitutively active in the absence of calmodulin. To examine if the removal of these domains also relieves the calcium/calmodulin dependence of O2 inhibition, we subjected porcine CaN to limited proteolysis by trypsin. A five-min incubation reduced the apparent molecular mass of the CaN A subunit from 60 to 42 kDa and rendered CaN activity calmodulin-independent (data not shown). When the trypsinized enzyme was preincubated with 1 milliunit/ml XO and 100 μm hypoxanthine for 5 min a similar inhibition was observed in the absence as well as in the presence of 1 mmCa2+ and 100 nm calmodulin, being 36.7 ± 4.2 and 46.1 ± 3.4% of control values, respectively. These data provide additional evidence that a calcium/calmodulin-dependent conformational change in CaN not only allows access of the substrate to the catalytic center but also makes it sensitive to O2 attack. Interestingly, CaN inhibition by H2O2 was also calcium/calmodulin-dependent (data not shown), indicating that both ROS are likely to act only after release of spatial restrictions by the autoinhibitory domain. NO is considered an O2 antagonist since both species react with each other at an almost diffusion-controlled rate to form peroxynitrite, itself a potent oxidizing agent. We tested the effect of the NO donor DEA-NO, which has a half-life of 10 min at 30 °C and generates 1.5 mol of NO per 1 mol of decomposed DEA-NO, on the activity of CaN in brain homogenates and that of isolated porcine CaN. Fig.5 shows that 50 μm DEA-NO (a concentration that completely scavenges O2 generated by 5 milliunits/ml XO as determined by the cytochrome c test) alone had no effect on CaN activity of the homogenate but significantly increased the activity of the purified enzyme, reflecting enzyme protection against inactivation during incubation. When added together with XO/hypoxanthine, DEA-NO protected CaN against inhibition. This indicates that NO serves as an O2 antagonist under conditions where O2-mediated inhibition of CaN would take place. In contrast, DEA-NO could not protect CaN against inhibition by 100 μm H2O2 (data not shown), confirming that NO acts solely as a selective O2 scavenger. Additionally, peroxynitrite formed by the reaction of O2 and NO obviously does not exert any inhibitory effect, at least at the XO and DEA-NO concentrations applied. Superoxide has been shown to react with various functional groups in proteins, including iron-sulfur clusters and protein thiols either in free state or metal-complexed, as in zinc fingers (25Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar, 26Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Keng Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24136-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In our previous work we could attribute inactivation of bovine CaN by phenylarsine oxide and H2O2 to the oxidation of protein cysteines (10Bogumil R. Namgaladze D. Schaarschmidt D. Schmachtel T. Hellstern S. Mutzel R. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, no thiol oxidation by O2seems to be responsible for CaN inhibition since our assay system contained 0.5 mm TCEP, an efficient disulfide-reducing agent. In addition, 1 or 5 mm dithiothreitol or 10 mm reduced glutathione did not influence XO/hypoxanthine inhibition of CaN activity (data not shown). Thus, O2 appears to inactivate CaN by some other mechanism. An obvious possibility could be an interaction of O2 with the iron-containing binuclear metal center of CaN, since O2 could, depending on the ligand field, either reduce ferric iron or oxidize ferrous iron with subsequent loss of catalytic activity. As mentioned before, the redox state of iron in CaN is under dispute (6Wang X. Culotta V.C. Klee C.B. Nature. 1996; 383: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Reiter T.A. Abraham R.T.

Metal content analysis of porcine CaN by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed the presence of equivalent amounts of iron and zinc in the protein (data not shown). To investigate the involvement of the metal center in the redox sensitivity of CaN, we treated the enzyme with 1 mm univalent oxidant K3Fe(CN)6 or with the same concentrations of K4Fe(CN)6 and KCN (Fig.6 A). K3Fe(CN)6 inhibited CaN activity to 17% that of controls, whereas K4Fe(CN)6 and KCN had only slight inhibitory effects, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of K3Fe(CN)6 is due to enzyme oxidation. We also tested the effect of 5 mm ascorbate with or without XO/hypoxanthine on CaN activity (Fig. 6 B). Ascorbate increased basal phosphate ester hydrolysis by CaN and protected the enzyme against inhibition by XO/hypoxanthine. Thus, CaN is inhibited by one-electron oxidizing agents and protected against O2inhibition by t"

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily cytokines are increasingly recognized as key modulators of angiogenesis. In this study, we tested whether TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE), a new member of the TNF superfamily, possesses angiogenic activity in vitro andin vivo. TRANCE stimulated DNA synthesis, chemotactic motility, and capillary-like tube formation in primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Both Matrigel plug assay in mice and chick chorioallantoic membrane assay revealed that TRANCE potently induced neovascularization in vivo. TRANCE had no effect on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in HUVECs and TRANCE-induced angiogenic activity was not suppressed by VEGF-neutralizing antibody, implying that TRANCE-induced angiogenesis may be the result of its direct action on endothelial cells. TRANCE evoked a time- and dose-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and focal adhesion kinase p125FAK in HUVECs, which are closely linked to angiogenesis. These signaling events were blocked by the Src inhibitor PP1 or the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122. Furthermore, these inhibitors and the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM suppressed TRANCE-induced HUVEC migration.

Thus, we postulated the possibility that TRANCE may contribute to the proper formation of new blood vessels. We here provide several lines of evidence that TRANCE potently induces angiogenesis in vivo and directly activates proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of endothelial cells.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that TRANCE has a novel function as an angiogenic factor. TRANCE stimulated angiogenesis in vivoby the mouse Matrigel plug assay and CAM assay. In the mouse Matrigel plug assay, the ability of TRANCE to promote neovessel formation was comparable with that of the well established angiogenic factor bFGF. Inin vitro angiogenesis models, we have revealed that the stimulation of HUVECs with TRANCE leads to an increase in cell proliferation as well as chemotactic motility and strongly induces the formation of tube network. Our data also showed that the mechanism by which TRANCE induces angiogenesis is dissimilar to TNFα, which requires VEGF expression for its angiogenic activity. The angiogenic activity of TRANCE appeared to be the result of its direct action on endothelial cells. Thus, we demonstrate here a novel biological action of TRANCE in vasculature formation in addition to the regulatory functions previously identified in immune responses and bone development (15Wong B.R.

We have delineated the expression and functionality of the cognate TRANCE receptor RANK in human endothelial cells. RANK expression in HUVECs and HMEC-1 was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-TRANCE (Fig. 1 and data not shown). As reported in osteoclasts and dendritic cells (16Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), activation of the receptor downstream signaling mediators, such as ERKs, Src, and AKT, was observed in HUVECs. Interestingly, we recently found that VEGF pretreatment increased RANK expression on the surface of HUVECs and subsequently potentiated the effects of TRANCE on ERK activation and tube formation. 2Y.-M. Kim and Y.-G. Kwon, unpublished observations. Therefore, these observations indicate that RANK is an active signaling receptor of TRANCE in endothelial cells.Our data show that TRANCE induces activation of ERK1/2 and p125FAK, which are closely linked to angiogenesis. Importantly, both Src and PLC are found to be the critical downstream molecules of RANK leading to these signaling events in human endothelial cells. In consistent with our data, the role of Src in TRANCE-induced signaling pathway was previously reported. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that a deficiency in Src blocks TRANCE-induced AKT activation in osteoclasts and dendritic cells in vitroand that the Src activity is required for TRANCE-mediated osteoclast survival (16Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Xing L. Venegas A.M. Chen A. Garrett-Beal L. Boyce B.F. Varmus H.E. Schwartzberg P.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that Src and PLC were required for TRANCE-induced HUVEC migration. The roles of these signaling molecules in angiogenesis are implicated in other systems. It has been shown that activation of Src is essential for VEGF-induced angiogenesis and that PLC is required for S1P-induced cell migration (36Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 100: 293-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 37Lee O.H. Lee D.J. Kim Y.M. Kim Y.S. Kwon H.J. Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence also noted the significant role of Ca2+ in endothelial cell migration (27He H. Venema V.J., Gu, X.

Kim K.W. Kwon Y.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In particular, a recent study showed that VEGF increases intracellular Ca2+ leading to the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by activation of endothelial NO synthase, and the resulting endothelial NO production is required for VEGF-induced angiogenesis including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and network formation (27He H. Venema V.J., Gu, X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that TRANCE-induced endothelial cell motility requires increases in intracellular Ca2+. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that NO production via the Src-PLC-Ca2+ signaling pathway may be an essential step in TRANCE-induced angiogenesis. Alternatively, AKT can mediate endothelial cell survival and lead to increases in NO production via activation of endothelial NO synthase (38Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3015) Google Scholar). Since we observed that TRANCE activated AKT in HUVECs (data not shown), the AKT signaling pathway may in part contribute to the angiogenic processes triggered by TRANCE. These possibilities are under investigation.New blood vessel formation is required for endochondral bone formation by serving as the conduit that allows a variety of cells essential for bone morphogenesis (endothelial cells, chondroclasts, and osteoblasts) to migrate into the growth plate. A recent study demonstrates that VEGF generated from hypertrophic chondrocytes in the epiphyseal growth plate couples hypertrophic cartilage remodeling, ossification, and angiogenesis during endochondral bone formation (19Gerber H.P., Vu, T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Since the angiogenic processes in vivo are regulated by coordinative action of various angiogenic factors in addition to VEGF, another factor generated from cells inside or in the close vicinity of cartilage seems to be involved in the progression of angiogenesis during bone formation. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that TRANCE produced by osteoblasts may play a cooperative role with VEGF in the proper vascular formation during bone growth and remodeling. Angiogenesis is also an essential requirement for tumor growth and metastasis and is regulated by a complex network of factors that interact between stromal cells, endothelial cells, and neoplastic cells within solid tumor. Cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, and TNFα, generated by tumor-associated macrophages, increase the expression of TRANCE with decrease of OPG expression in stromal cells (39Nakashima T. Kobayashi Y. Yamasaki S. Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Sasaki H. Sakai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that TRANCE produced by stromal cells may be involved in the formation of microvessels in the tumor site. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1α elevate TRANCE expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (40Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L. Anderson F. Nelson M. Maloney W. Osdoby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20659-20672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These results together with our observation suggest that the timely generation of TRANCE from endothelial cells by other inflammatory cytokines may in part contribute to new vasculature formation in an inflammatory site. Thus, we propose that TRANCE can act as an important modulator of angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing endothelium, is a fundamental step in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions including wound healing, embryonic development, chronic inflammation, and tumor growth (1Folkman J.

The angiogenic process is tightly controlled by a wide variety of positive or negative regulators, which are composed of growth factors, cytokines, lipid metabolites, and cryptic fragments of hemostatic proteins (4Bussolino F. Mantovani A. Persico G. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 251-256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and many of these factors are initially characterized in other biological activities. Positive regulators of angiogenesis are classified into two groups: direct inducers, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorTNFtumor necrosis factorTRANCETNF-related activation-induced cytokineRANKreceptor activator of NF-κBNFnuclear factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHUVEC(s)human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)FBSfetal bovine serumRTreverse transcriptaseCAM(s)chorioallantoic membrane(s)IPTtotal inositol phosphateIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateFAKfocal adhesion kinasePLCphospholipase CNOnitric oxidePKCprotein kinase C 1VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorbFGFbasic fibroblast growth factorTNFtumor necrosis factorTRANCETNF-related activation-induced cytokineRANKreceptor activator of NF-κBNFnuclear factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinasePMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateHUVEC(s)human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)FBSfetal bovine serumRTreverse transcriptaseCAM(s)chorioallantoic membrane(s)IPTtotal inositol phosphateIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateFAKfocal adhesion kinasePLCphospholipase CNOnitric oxidePKCprotein kinase C and bFGF that can induce proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of endothelial cells and indirect inducers that act on endothelial cells via production of direct angiogenic factors from accessory cells such as immune cells and tumor cells (4Bussolino F.

TRANCE expressed on activated T cells promotes the survival of dendritic cells and modulates T helper cell responses to viral infections (9Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B., Li, H.L.

TRANCE is also highly expressed on osteoblasts and plays a key role in osteoclast differentiation from hematopoietic precursors and calcium metabolism (11Li J. Sarosi I. Yan X.Q. Morony S.

Recently, it has been also reported that, in a T cell-dependent model of rat adjuvant arthritis, TRANCE regulates bone loss and cartilage destruction (13Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B.

Nature. 1999; 402: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). These effects of TRANCE are exerted by its binding to the transmembrane receptor RANK (receptor activator of NF-κB). RANK is detected on mature dendritic cells, chondrocytes, osteoclast precursors, and mature osteoclasts (9Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B., Li, H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp.

The vasculature is crucial for the processes of bone formation by paving the way for a variety of cells essential for bone morphogenesis, including osteoblasts, to migrate into cartilage (18Harper J. Kalgsbrun M. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 617-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Gerber H.P., Vu, T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). Osteoblasts express TRANCE, which can interact with RANK on the surface of endothelial cells during migration into cartilage. Thus, we postulated the possibility that TRANCE may contribute to the proper formation of new blood vessels. We here provide several lines of evidence that TRANCE potently induces angiogenesis in vivo and directly activates proliferation, migration, and morphogenesis of endothelial cells. DISCUSSIONIn this report, we demonstrate that TRANCE has a novel function as an angiogenic factor. TRANCE stimulated angiogenesis in vivoby the mouse Matrigel plug assay and CAM assay. In the mouse Matrigel plug assay, the ability of TRANCE to promote neovessel formation was comparable with that of the well established angiogenic factor bFGF. Inin vitro angiogenesis models, we have revealed that the stimulation of HUVECs with TRANCE leads to an increase in cell proliferation as well as chemotactic motility and strongly induces the formation of tube network. Our data also showed that the mechanism by which TRANCE induces angiogenesis is dissimilar to TNFα, which requires VEGF expression for its angiogenic activity. The angiogenic activity of TRANCE appeared to be the result of its direct action on endothelial cells. Thus, we demonstrate here a novel biological action of TRANCE in vasculature formation in addition to the regulatory functions previously identified in immune responses and bone development (15Wong B.R.

We have delineated the expression and functionality of the cognate TRANCE receptor RANK in human endothelial cells. RANK expression in HUVECs and HMEC-1 was confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot, and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-TRANCE (Fig. 1 and data not shown). As reported in osteoclasts and dendritic cells (16Wong B.R. Besser D. Kim N. Arron J.R. Vologodskaia M. Hanafusa H. Choi Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1041-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), activation of the receptor downstream signaling mediators, such as ERKs, Src, and AKT, was observed in HUVECs. Interestingly, we recently found that VEGF pretreatment increased RANK expression on the surface of HUVECs and subsequently potentiated the effects of TRANCE on ERK activation and tube formation. 2Y.-M. Kim and Y.-G. Kwon, unpublished observations. Therefore, these observations indicate that RANK is an active signaling receptor of TRANCE in endothelial cells.Our data show that TRANCE induces activation of ERK1/2 and p125FAK, which are closely linked to angiogenesis.

Our results indicate that TRANCE-induced endothelial cell motility requires increases in intracellular Ca2+. Therefore, our findings raise the possibility that NO production via the Src-PLC-Ca2+ signaling pathway may be an essential step in TRANCE-induced angiogenesis.

This evidence suggests that TRANCE produced by stromal cells may be involved in the formation of microvessels in the tumor site. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1α elevate TRANCE expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (40Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L. Anderson F. Nelson M. Maloney W. Osdoby P. J. Biol.

Since the angiogenic processes in vivo are regulated by coordinative action of various angiogenic factors in addition to VEGF, another factor generated from cells inside or in the close vicinity of cartilage seems to be involved in the progression of angiogenesis during bone formation. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that TRANCE produced by osteoblasts may play a cooperative role with VEGF in the proper vascular formation during bone growth and remodeling. Angiogenesis is also an essential requirement for tumor growth and metastasis and is regulated by a complex network of factors that interact between stromal cells, endothelial cells, and neoplastic cells within solid tumor. Cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, and TNFα, generated by tumor-associated macrophages, increase the expression of TRANCE with decrease of OPG expression in stromal cells (39Nakashima T. Kobayashi Y. Yamasaki S. Kawakami A. Eguchi K. Sasaki H. Sakai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This evidence suggests that TRANCE produced by stromal cells may be involved in the formation of microvessels in the tumor site. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1α elevate TRANCE expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (40Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L. Anderson F. Nelson M. Maloney W. Osdoby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20659-20672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These results together with our observation suggest that the timely generation of TRANCE from endothelial cells by other inflammatory cytokines may in part contribute to new vasculature formation in an inflammatory site. Thus, we propose that TRANCE can act as an important modulator of angiogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions.

Three members of the Cool/Pix family have shown distinct regulatory activities: (i) p50Cool-1 inhibits Cdc42/Rac-stimulated PAK activity, (ii) p85Cool-1/β-Pix has a permissive effect on Cdc42/Rac-stimulated activity, and (iii) p90Cool-2/α-Pix strongly activates PAK. We initially suspected that these different functional effects were due to a binding interaction that occurs at the carboxyl-terminal ends of the larger Cool/Pix proteins, thus enabling them to stimulate (or at least permit) rather than inhibit PAK activity. This led to the identification of the Cat proteins (forCool-associated tyrosine phosphosubstrates). However, here we show that the Cat proteins bind to the carboxyl-terminal ends of p85Cool-1(residues 523–546) and Cool-2 (residues 647–670), and that the binding of Cat to Cool-2 in fact is not necessary for the Cool-2-mediated activation of PAK. Rather, an 18-amino acid region, designated T1, that is present in the Cool-1 proteins, but missing in Cool-2, is essential for controlling the regulation of PAK activity by Cool-1/β-Pix in vivo. Deletion of T1 yielded a p85Cool-1 molecule that mimicked the Cool-2 protein and was capable of strongly stimulating PAK activity. However, when T1 was added to Cool-2, the ability of Cool-2 to directly activate PAK was lost. We conclude that T1 represents a novel regulatory domain that accounts for the specific functional effects on PAK activity exhibited by the different members of the Cool/Pix family.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ste20, the homolog of the mammalian PAKs, is involved in pheromone response by stimulating a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that leads to the transcription of genes required for cell cycle arrest as well as activates a distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that causes filamentous growth in response to nitrogen starvation (20Herskomitz I.

A family of PAK-binding proteins that have strong regulatory effects on PAK function have been identified and called Cool (cloned-out of library) or Pix (PAK-interactive exchange factor) (29Bagrodia S.

We have been particularly interested in three members of the family, namely p50Cool-1, p85Cool-1 (identical to β-Pix and the 85PR protein), and p90Cool-2 (identical to α-Pix) (29Bagrodia S.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the present work, we set out to understand some initially puzzling results regarding the distinct functional effects exhibited by different members of the Cool/Pix family of proteins. When p50Cool-1 was originally identified, it was suspected to serve as an upstream activator of Cdc42 or Rac because of the presence of a tandem DH/PH domain (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The fact that the p50Cool-1 protein was discovered based on its ability to directly bind PAK-3, a member of a family of Cdc42/Rac-targets, thereby suggested the existence of a signaling complex that contained both an upstream regulator and a downstream effector for the Cdc42 or Rac GTP-binding protein. However, we found that p50Cool-1 was not capable of stimulating PAK activity, as would have been expected if it were acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Cdc42 or Rac, but instead inhibited PAK activation by Dbl or by activated forms of Cdc42 (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The p85Cool-1 (β-Pix) protein, which represents a longer splice variant form of p50Cool-1, did not inhibit Dbl- or activated Cdc42-stimulated PAK activity, but it also was incapable of directly stimulating PAK activity. However, the Cool-2 (α-Pix) protein, which appears to represent a distinct gene product with SH3, DH, and PH domains that are ∼70% identical to those found in the Cool-1 proteins, is able to strongly activate PAK. As an initial attempt to explain the distinct functional effects mediated by the different Cool/Pix proteins, we searched for potential cellular regulatory proteins that bound selectively to the extended carboxyl-terminal ends of p85Cool-1 and Cool-2 and might prevent these carboxyl-terminal regions from adopting a conformation that inhibited access to the DH/PH domains and/or to the kinase active site of PAK. We in fact identified a family of specific binding partners for p85Cool-1 and Cool-2, named Cats (Cool-associated tyrosine phosphosubstrates) (31Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L.

However, we show here that the Cats do not influence the ability of the Cool proteins to directly regulate PAK activity, although they may play a key role in the recruitment of Cool proteins to endosomal membranes. Instead, we have found that an 18-amino acid region, designated T1, serves as a novel and essential element for the regulation of PAK activation, accounting for the lack of stimulatory effects on PAK activity exhibited by p50Cool-1 and p85Cool-1. Plasmid pJ3HmPAK-3 was made as described previously (7Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

The plasmid pcDNA3-myc-Cool-2(Δ641) was constructed using a double PCR method. Each new mutant plasmid was sequenced at the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Plasmids pJ3HmPAK-3 (0.3 μg/60-mm dish) and pcDNA3myc-Cool or Cool mutants (1.2–2.0 μg/60-mm dish) were co-transfected into COS7 cells using the LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed after 36–48 h. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysates were cleared by spinning at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The different GST·p85Cool-1 constructs were each expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. Cell lysates from COS7 cells transiently transfected with Myc- or HA-tagged Cat-2 were combined with 20 μl of a 1:1 suspension of GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated at 4 °C for 2–3 h. The beads were then precipitated by microcentrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane and probed with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse antibody by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). COS7 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer A (40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) plus 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate and 5% glycerol. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysates were incubated with anti-PAK-3 primary antibody (a gift from Dr. S. Pelech, Kinetek Biotechnology Corporation, Vancouver, British Columbia) for 1 h followed by mixing with protein A-Sepharose beads for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer A and resuspended in Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). The membrane was immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody. Lysates were incubated with anti-PAK-3 primary antibody for 1.5 h followed by mixing with protein A-Sepharose beads (Invitrogen) for 45 min. The beads were washed three times with buffer A, twice with 2× phosphorylation buffer (10 mmMgCl2 and 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and mixed with 1.5 μg/sample of the substrate myelin basic protein (Sigma). PAK assays were initiated by adding 25 μmATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) to the immunoprecipitation mixture and were performed at 22 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 20 mm EDTA. The phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and visualized by PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences) prior to immunoblotting. Myc-tagged Cool/Pix proteins were expressed in COS7 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitation complex was incubated with 1 μg of Cdc42 preloaded with [3H]GDP in 140 μl of reaction buffer at room temperature, and 23-μl aliquots were diluted into 1.5 ml of ice-cold termination buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mmNaCl, pH 7.4) at various time points. The percent [3H]GDP remaining on the filters was detected by scintillation counting. The release of [3H]GDP from Cdc42 measures the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of the Cool/Pix proteins. We have been studying three members of the Cool/Pix family in some detail; p50Cool-1, p85Cool-1, and Cool-2 (Fig. 1). Given our working hypothesis that the binding of the Cat proteins to Cool-2 and/or p85Cool-1 was responsible for their distinct functional effects relative to the inhibitory activity of p50Cool-1, we set out to delineate a limit-binding domain on the Cool proteins for the Cats and to test whether this binding interaction was in fact essential for the ability of Cool proteins to promote (or permit) rather than inhibit PAK activation. We began by considering three distinguishable regions within the carboxyl-terminal domain of p85Cool-1as potential Cat-binding sites; a histidine-rich domain (designated as 85HR, residues 419–456), a proline-rich domain (PRD, residues 461–486), and a glutamic acid-rich domain (ERD, residues 511–634) (Fig. 2 A). To define which domain is capable of binding Cat, we prepared GST fusion proteins that contained each of these domains; specifically, GST·T1-HRD-PRD consisted of residues 394–487 of p85Cool-1, GST·PR contained residues 460–550, and GST·ER consisted of residues 511–640 (Fig. 2 A). The immobilized GST·T1-HRD-PRD, -PR, or -ER constructs were then incubated with cell lysates expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Cat-2. We found that both GST·PR and GST·ER were able to bind Cat (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Residues 527–539 in p85Cool-1 represent the Cat-binding domain. A, the carboxyl-terminal region of p85Cool-1 contains three distinct regions: a histidine-rich domain (HRD, residues 419–456), a proline-rich domain (PRD, residues 461–486), and a glutamic acid-rich domain (ERD, residues 511–634). Different GST fusion constructs that included these domains (labeled GST·T1-HRD-PRD, GST·PR, and GST·ER), or portions of these domains as indicated in the figure were used for mapping the Cat-binding domain. B, in vitro Cat binding analysis with various GST fusion domains. The GST fusion proteins were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To perform the in vitro binding, 20–40 μg of GST fusion proteins that were immobilized on glutathione agarose beads were incubated with 500 μg of lysate protein prepared from cells expressing HA-tagged Cat-2, with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. The co-precipitated HA-Cat was detected by Western blotting. Top panel, co-precipitated HA-tagged Cat-2 detected by immunoblot with an anti-HA antibody;bottom panel, Coomassie Blue staining of the GST fusion proteins. C, alignment of the Cat-binding domains in p85Cool-1 and Cool-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There is an overlapping region shared by the GST·PR and GST·ER fusion proteins, representing residues 511–550 in p85Cool-1 (Fig. 2 A). To better define the Cat-binding site, we made an additional four truncations within the ER domain, designated ER2, ER3, ER4 and ER5 (Fig. 2 A). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the GST·ER2 and GST·ER3 fusion constructs had the same binding affinity for Cat as GST·ER, whereas the GST·ER4 construct was only capable of weak binding and GST·ER5 showed no detectable binding activity. These data suggest that the Cat-binding site lies within residues 527–542 on p85Cool-1. To further delineate the Cat-binding site, we prepared another truncation, ER4.5 (Fig. 2 A), and found that like ER5, it was incapable of binding Cat (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these findings indicate that Cat binds between residues 527–539 on p85Cool-1 (Fig. 2 C). The amino acid sequence within this region is AALEEDAQILKVI. It should be noted that a highly conserved sequence is found within residues 685–698 of Cool-2 (Fig. 2 C). To identify amino acid residues on p85Cool-1that are essential for binding Cat, we made four mutations within the GST·ER3 background (the individual point mutations L536A, K537A, V538A, and the triple mutation L536A/K537A/V538A. We expressed and purified these different GST·ER3 mutants and performed Cat-binding assays. We found that the [L536A]ER3 and [K537A]ER3 mutants were still fully capable of binding Cat (Fig.3, lanes 2 and 3). However, both the [V538A]ER3 mutant and the [L536A/K537A/V538A]ER3 triple mutant showed little or no ability to bind Cat (Fig. 3,lanes 4 and 5). The same results were obtained when assaying p85Cool-1 interactions with Cat in cells via the co-immunoprecipitation of these proteins (data not shown). Thus, Val-538 appears to be an essential residue for the binding of p85Cool-1 to Cat. We then examined whether the binding of Cat was in fact essential for the stimulatory effects mediated by Cool on PAK activity. We performed these experiments with Cool-2 because it is capable of strongly activating PAK, whereas p85Cool-1 typically shows little detectable stimulation (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because we have found that the Cool-2 triple mutation L694A/K695A/V696A does not completely eliminate its binding to Cat, to avoid any ambiguity a Cat-binding defective Cool-2 protein was generated by deleting the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein that includes the Cat-binding site (designated Cool-2(Δ641)). Wild type Cool-2 and the Cool-2(Δ641) mutant were co-transfected with HA-tagged Cat-2 into COS7 cells and binding assays were performed. The upper panel in Fig.4 A compares the relative levels of expression of the Cool-2 constructs. Under conditions where wild type Cool-2 gave a strong binding signal (Fig. 4 A,lower panel, lane 2), the Cool-2(Δ641) deletion mutant was unable to bind Cat (lane 3). We next directly compared the effects of these Cool-2 constructs on PAK activity. The upper panels in Fig. 4 B compare the relative levels of expression of the Cool proteins being examined whereas the middle panels compare the relative amounts of PAK for the different assays. As earlier reported (31Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L. Premont R.T. Taylor S.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22393-22400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we found that the expression of wild type Cool-2 was capable of strongly stimulating the ability of PAK to phosphorylate myelin basic protein, whereas p85Cool-1 showed little stimulatory activity (Fig. 4 B, lower left panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). The Cool-2(Δ641) truncation mutant, however, activated PAK to the same extent as the wild type Cool-2 protein (Fig. 4 B, lower right panel, comparelanes 1 and 3), under experimental conditions where no binding of Cat was observed. These data clearly indicate that the binding of Cat is not required for the ability of Cool-2 to stimulate PAK activity. If the binding of the Cat proteins is not a determinant for the stimulatory capability of Cool-2, then what role do Cool-Cat interactions play in Cool function? It has been reported that PAK-Cool-Cat complexes may be involved in vesicle trafficking because Cat contains an Arf-GAP activity and localizes to endosome membranes (35Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that although wild type Cool-2 co-localizes with endosomal markers (e.g. EEA1), Cool-2 mutants that are unable to bind Cat appeared to be more diffusely localized throughout the cytosol (data not shown). This leads us to suspect that Cool/Cat binding interactions are necessary for the proper translocation of Cool proteins to vesicle membranes. Given the results described in the preceding section, we searched for other explanations for the distinct functional effects of the Cool/Pix proteins. We decided to consider possible differences between the Cool-1 and Cool-2 proteins, given that only Cool-2 is capable of directly activating PAK. Immediately downstream from the PH domain, Cool-2 contains a serine-rich region (designated as 90SR) whereas p85Cool-1 contains a histidine-rich region (85 HR) (see Fig. 1). Both proteins then contain similar proline-rich (PRD) and carboxyl-terminal regions (ERD). Note that p50Cool-1 lacks the histidine-rich region, as well as the proline- and glutamic acid-rich regions found in p85Cool-1, but contains a distinct carboxyl-terminal region (designated 50C). To examine the potential regulatory influence exerted by the carboxyl-terminal regions of p85Cool-1 versus Cool-2, we prepared a carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant of Cool-1, designated SH·PH-Cool-1, which contains just the SH3, DH, and PH domains (Fig.5 A). This mutant was transiently transfected into COS7 cells and its effects on PAK activity were examined. In Fig. 5 B, as well as others (i.e. Figs. 5 C and 7), the upper panelcompares the relative levels of expression of the different constructs being examined, whereas the middle panel compares the relative amounts of PAK-3 assayed. As expected, the Cool-2 protein gave rise to a strong stimulation of PAK activity, as assayed by the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate (myelin basic protein) (Fig.5 B, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and5). Wild type p85Cool-1 had no effect on PAK activity (compare lanes 1 and 5), consistent with previous findings (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar); however, the carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant SH·PH-Cool-1 activated PAK as effectively as Cool-2 (lane 4). This suggested that there was an element downstream of the PH domain of p85Cool-1 that negatively regulated PAK activation.Figure 7The abilities of Cool-1, Cool-2, and a Cool-1/Cool-2 chimera to activate PAK. A, schematic representation of Cool-1 and Cool-2 constructs, and a Cool-1/Cool-2 chimera. B, both SH·PR-Cool-2 and SH·PH-Cool-2 stimulate PAK activity in vivo, but Cool-2-T1-IN does not. COS7 cells were transfected with plasmid J3HmPAK-3 expressing HA-tagged WT PAK-3 together with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged SH·PR-Cool-2 (lane 1), SH·PH-Cool-2 (lanes 2 and7), CHIM·Cool (lane 5), Cool-2-T1-IN (lane 6), p85Cool-1 (lane 8), and Cool-2 (lanes 4 and 9). Theupper panel shows the relative expression of the different Cool proteins. The middle panel shows the relative amounts of PAK-3 assayed, and the lower panel shows the assay results, performed as described in the legend to Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To more precisely define this negative regulatory region, we made another truncation mutant, designated SH·HR-Cool-1 (Fig.5 A), which lacks residues downstream of the 85HR domain. This truncation mutant behaved in a manner identical to wild type p85Cool-1 and was unable to stimulate PAK activity (Fig. 5 B, lower panel, comparelanes 2 and 3). Thus, these data indicated that the region in p85Cool-1 that negatively regulates PAK activation is located between the PH and proline-rich domains. Within this region of p85Cool-1, there are two distinguishable stretches of sequence. One is the histidine-rich region (85HR) that is absent from both p50Cool-1 and Cool-2 (Fig. 5 A). The other is immediately downstream from the PH domain and contains 18 amino acid residues that are conserved in p50Cool-1 but not in Cool-2 (Fig.5 A). We have designated this region as T1. To define which of these two regions may be responsible for regulating PAK activity, we further truncated 85HR, yielding the construct designated SH·T1-Cool-1, and determined the effect of this truncation mutant on PAK activity. As shown in Fig. 5 C (lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 4), SH·T1-Cool-1 activated PAK activity as effectively as Cool-2 (lower panel,lane 2), whereas SH·PR-Cool-1, which contains both 85HR and the proline-rich region (Fig. 5 A), was completely ineffective. It should be noted that the inability of SH·HR-Cool-1 as well as SH·PR-Cool-1 to activate PAK was not because of their inability to bind PAK. Fig. 6 shows the results of experiments in which HA-tagged PAK-3 was co-expressed with different Myc-tagged Cool constructs, followed by precipitating PAK and Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody to detect associated Cool proteins. We found that both SH·HR-Cool-1 and SH·PR-Cool-1 bound PAK as effectively as Cool-2 and SH·T1-Cool-1, which strongly stimulate PAK activity. Thus, taken together, these results suggested that the 85HR region has an inhibitory effect on PAK activation. Given that the p50Cool-1 protein, which lacks the 85HR region, also is incapable of stimulating PAK activity but instead inhibits Dbl- or Cdc42-stimulated activity (29Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordan K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the T1 region may serve as a hinge that allows downstream regions on p85Cool-1 (85HR) and p50Cool-1 (e.g. the region designated 50C (Fig. 1)) to fold over and block access to the DH/PH domain, or the kinase domain of PAK, respectively. To test this idea, we took two approaches. First, we replaced the corresponding region of Cool-2 with the T1 region from Cool-1 and constructed the Cool-2 mutant designated Cool-2-T1-IN (Fig. 7 A). If in fact T1 is responsible for mediating an inhibitory effect on PAK activation, then Cool·2-T1-IN should be incapable of stimulating PAK activity. Second, we replaced the entire carboxyl-terminal half of p85Cool-1, beginning with the T1 region and extending to the carboxyl terminus, with the corresponding region from Cool-2; this chimera was designated CHIM-Cool (Fig. 7 A). Here the idea was that the absence of T1 should enable CHIM-Cool to activate PAK. In addition, we prepared two other Cool-2 truncation mutants, designated SH·PH-Cool-2 and SH·PR-Cool-2, that corresponded to the two Cool-1 truncation mutants SH·PH-Cool-1 and SH·PR-Cool-1, respectively (see Fig. 5 A). Fig. 7 B shows the results obtained with these different Cool constructs. The top panel compares the relative levels of expression of the different Cool proteins whereas the middle panel shows the relative amounts of PAK-3 for the different assays of PAK activity (bottom panel). As we expected, Cool-2-T1-IN lost the ability to stimulate PAK and behaved in a manner identical to p85Cool-1 (Fig. 7 B, lower panel, lane 6). On the other hand, CHIM-Cool, like Cool-2 (lanes 4 and 9), was able to strongly stimulate PAK activity (Fig. 7 B, lower panel, compare lanes 3 and 5). The truncation mutant, SH·PH-Cool-2, like SH·PH-Cool-1, stimulated PAK activity (Fig.7 B, lower panel, see lanes 2 and 7). However, unlike SH·PR-Cool-1, which was not able to stimulate PAK activity, the SH·PR-Cool-2 truncation mutant lacking the T1 region was able to strongly activate PAK (Fig. 7 B, lower panel, compare lanes 1 and 3). All of these data argue that the T1 region in the Cool-1 proteins is responsible for mediating the repression of PAK activation. We went on to further examine whether the T1 region can mediate the inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of p85Cool-1. As shown in Fig. 8, although the SH·PR-Cool-2 protein was capable of acting as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the chimera Cool-2-T1-IN (in which the T1 region from Cool-1 was inserted into SH·PR-Cool-2 immediately after the PH domain) did not catalyze nucleotide exchange. However, the SH·T1-Cool-1 truncation mutant did show GEF activity (Fig. 8), suggesting that the T1 region itself does not directly interact with the DH/PH domain and block its GEF activity. The GEF activities that we measured for the different Cool mutants correlated well with the effects of these mutants on PAK activation. Thus, taken together, these data support the idea that the T1 region is responsible for enabling downstream segments of the Cool proteins to inhibit GEF activity and PAK activation. The Cool/Pix proteins contain the tandem arrangement of DH and PH domains that are characteristic of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTP-binding proteins. Because of this, their initial discovery as PAK-binding partners led to the assumption that the Cool/Pix proteins were upstream activators of Rac and/or Cdc42, directly complexed to a Cdc42/Rac target. However, it was soon appreciated that different members of the Cool/Pix family exhibited distinct functional effects on PAK such that p50Cool-1 inhibited the ability of Dbl or activated Cdc42 to stimulate PAK activity, whereas p85Cool-1/β-Pix did not interfere with Dbl- or Cdc42-mediated stimulation, and Cool-2/α-Pix strongly activated PAK (36Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). We originally questioned whether the distinct functional activities associated with the different Cool proteins were the outcome of a specific binding interaction between the carboxyl-terminal domains of p85Cool-1/β-Pix and Cool-2/α-Pix with a cellular protein that served as a regulatory factor. The idea was that because p50Cool-1 lacked an extended carboxyl-terminal domain, it would not be capable of binding to the putative regulatory factor and thereby associated with PAK in an orientation that blocked access to the PAK active site. The binding of p85Cool-1/β-Pix or Cool-2/α-Pix to the regulatory factor would ensure the proper orientation of these Cool/Pix proteins such that they did not interfere with the kinase active site and instead permitted or even promoted PAK activation. This led to the identification of the Cat proteins, which are highly similar to the Git and PKL proteins (33Premont R.T. Clain A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L.R. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14082-14087Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 34Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), and bind to p85Cool-1/β-Pix and Cool-2/α-Pix but not to p50Cool-1. However, we show here quite clearly that the binding of Cat to Cool-2 is not necessary for Cool-2-mediated activation of PAK. Preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that the role of the Cats is to ensure the proper localization of the Cool/Pix proteins, particularly to endosomes. The ability of the Cool/Pix proteins to interact with the Cat/Git/PKL proteins, which in turn bind paxillin and function as Arf-GAPs, places them at focal adhesion complexes and endosomal membranes, perhaps providing a link between cell adhesion-induced signaling and intracellular trafficking. The necessity for such a link is suggested by the findings that Arf6, long suspected to be involved in intracellular trafficking, also controls cell spreading (37Daniel R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Song J. Khachikan Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 15: 2257-2267Google Scholar). The finding that the Cats are not essential for Cool-2-mediated activation of PAK has led us to consider alternative mechanisms that could account for the functional differences between the different members of the Cool family. We have now delineated a limit region that accounts for the distinct functional activities. This 18 amino acid region (T1) contains 4 proline residues that may form a turn that enables downstream segments of p50Cool-1 to fold back or become positioned in a way that blocks access to the active site of PAK or even prevents the guanine nucleotide exchange factor-independent activation of PAK that has been suggested to occur through the direct binding of the Cool-2/α-Pix proteins (37Daniel R.H. Zenke F.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6047-6050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The T1 region also appears to account for the inability of p85Cool-1/β-Pix to mirror the actions of Cool-2 and stimulate PAK activity, the idea being that T1 enables downstream segments of p85Cool-1 to fold back over the DH/PH domains and inhibit guanine nucleotide exchange activity. The fact that the T1 region contains a number of serine and threonine residues (8 total) also raises the possibility that it serves as a site for regulatory phosphorylation events. Various lines of evidence have now implicated the Cool/Pix proteins as playing key roles in interfacing diverse signaling pathways. The PAK proteins, which serve as primary binding partners for Cool/Pix, have also been implicated in a variety of biological activities ranging from integrin-mediated signaling and alterations in the actin cytoskeletal architecture to the activation of nuclear mitogen-activated protein kinases. Thus, PAK activation may serve to coordinate various cellular events and is also likely to require intricate regulation, as might be provided by the Cool/Pix proteins. Although we now have some insight into how the individual Cool proteins are able to confer distinct regulatory effects on PAK, a definitive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the negative regulatory activity of the T1 region will await structural determinations of the full-length Cool proteins. Moreover, little is known regarding to what extent each of the Cool/Pix proteins participate in the various functions of PAK. Future studies will be directed toward understanding whether multiple regulatory activities of Cool/Pix need to be exerted in the same cells or if different Cool proteins exert their specific regulatory effects in a cell-type-specific manner. It will also be interesting to see if the inhibitory effects exhibited by p50Cool-1 on PAK activity, or the lack of stimulatory effects exhibited by p85Cool-1, can be altered or reversed by cellular proteins that bind to and/or phosphorylation events that alter the orientation of the T1 region.

A catalytically active fragment of SPase (SPase-(Δ2–75)), which lacks the two transmembrane segments and the cytoplasmic domain, has been cloned, overexpressed, characterized (12Kuo D.W. Chan H.K.

The shallow hydrophobic pockets observed adjacent to the catalytic residues helped to explain the Ala-X-Ala substrate specificity. The structure also revealed that SPase is an unusual serine protease in that it attacks the substrate scissile amide carbonyl from thesi-face rather than the re-face as seen in most serine proteases (15Bullock T.L. Breddam K. Remington S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 16James M.N. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Proteolysis and Protein Turnover. Portland, Brookfield, VT1994: 1-8Google Scholar). An important component of the catalytic machinery in serine proteases is the oxyanion hole that works by neutralizing the developing negative charge on the scissile carbonyl oxygen during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediates. Typically oxyanion holes are formed by two main-chain amide hydrogens that serve as hydrogen bond donors to the developing oxyanion (17Menard R. Storer A.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1992; 373: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The inhibitor-bound structure of E. coli SPase (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) revealed only one hydrogen bond donor (Ser-90 NH) to the inhibitors acyl carbonyl group. Although there was no other potential main-chain hydrogen bond donor it was suggested that the side-chain hydroxyl group from Ser-88 could fulfill the role if it were not blocked by the bulky thiazolidine ring of the inhibitor. Here we present crystallographic evidence that in agreement with recent mutagenesis data (18Carlos J.L. Klenotic P.A. Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7276-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that the hydroxyl group of Ser-88 does contribute to the oxyanion hole in the Gram-negative signal peptidases. A detailed analysis of the active site of SPase-(Δ2–75) in the absence of inhibitor or substrate (apoenzyme) reveals significant differences from the inhibitor-bound structure and reveals a strong candidate for the key deacylating water in the proposed mechanism. We also present a structural comparison with other Ser/Lys proteases from the LexA family of proteases. A signal peptide is modeled into the binding sites of SPase based on the structure of the bound cleavage site region in LexA.

Subtle adjustments to the previously published crystallization conditions (14Paetzel M. Chernaia M. Strynadka N. Tschantz W. Cao G. Dalbey R.E. James M.N. Proteins. 1995; 23: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) resulted in the formation of a new crystal form of Δ2–75. The crystals of apoenzyme SPase-(Δ2–75) were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion with a reservoir consisting of 0.70 m ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.4 and a drop consisting of 4 μl of protein and 8 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals formed in drops that had been left undisturbed for 6 weeks at a consistent temperature of 22 °C. The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 112.4 Å, b = 112.4 Å, c = 198.7 Å. Given the unit cell dimensions and the molecular weight, the specific volume (Vm) (19Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar) is 2.78 Å3/Da for four molecules in the asymmetric unit. The x-ray diffraction intensities were measured at 100 K on beamline BL7–1 (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory) at a wavelength of 1.08000 Å. The data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Baily S. Denzo. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, 1993: 56-62Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution was found using the program AmoRe (21Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), and the atomic coordinates of the previously published crystal structure of the SPase-(Δ2–75) inhibitor complex (PDB, 1B12). Rebuilding of some of the flexible regions was required because of differences resulting from crystal packing. Model building and analysis was performed with the program XFIT within the suite XTALVIEW (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar).

Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) (cast.engr.uic.edu/cast/). A model of a signal peptide bound to the binding sites of SPase was prepared by using the structure of the covalently bound penem inhibitor complex to guide the position of the P1 Ala residue of the substrate. The P3 Ala position to the P6 substrate position was guided by the structure of the cleavage site domain of the analogous enzyme LexA (PDB code, 1JHE). The model was prepared using the program O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kieldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar).

Atomic coordinates for the SPase-(Δ2–75) penem inhibitor complex structure (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C.

The catalytic domain of E. coli type I signal peptidase (SPase-(Δ2–75)) has been crystallized in the absence of inhibitor or substrate (apoenzyme). Earlier attempts to crystallize the apoenzyme of SPase-(Δ2–75) resulted in poorly diffracting crystals that belonged to the tetragonal space group P42212 (14Paetzel M. Chernaia M. Strynadka N. Tschantz W. Cao G. Dalbey R.E. James M.N. Proteins. 1995; 23: 122-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adjustments to the previously published crystallization conditions have resulted in improved crystals of the apoenzyme that belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 with diffraction to 2.4 Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Typical of many enzyme systems, the apoenzyme form is apparently less ordered than that of the inhibitor bound form. Orthorhombic (P21212) crystals of the E. coliSPase acyl-enzyme inhibitor complex were shown to diffract to beyond 1.9 Å resolution (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Both the apoenzyme structure and the acyl-enzyme inhibitor-bound structure reveal two different paths taken for the N-terminal region (residues 80–85) just preceding the nucleophilic Ser-90. In two of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit this region is in a β-strand conformation and in the other two there is a bulge in this region. This difference in the N-terminal region appears to be the result of crystal-packing forces. If we compare molecules with similar N-terminal region conformations we see little change in the overall structure upon formation of the inhibitor acyl-enzyme complex. The root mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) upon superposition of the apoenzyme structure (molecule A) and the acyl-enzyme inhibitor-bound structure (molecule A) is 0.558 Å for 234 common Cα atoms. Most of the differences arise from the extended loops and hairpins near the solvent surface (108–124, 170–176, 198–202, and 304–313). Comparing molecules with dissimilar N-terminal region conformations gives a significantly larger r.m.s.d.; for example superimposing molecule B from the apoenzyme structure onto molecule A in the inhibitor-bound acyl-enzyme structure gives an r.m.s.d. of 0.974. Comparing the apoenzyme and acyl-enzyme active site residues reveals very little change in the position of the nucleophilic Ser-90 and general base Lys-145 (Fig. 1). There are however significant differences in the substrate-binding pockets. The shallow and hydrophobic substrate-binding pockets of E. coliSPase are consistent with the substrate specificity for small and neutral residues at the P1 and P3 position (P1 and P3 (31Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar) correspond to the −1 and −3 position relative to the cleavage site) (32von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). The S1 pocket is made up of nonpolar atoms from residues 86–88, 90–91, 95, and 143–145. The S3 pocket is made up of nonpolar atoms from residues 84, 86, 101, 132, 142, and 144. In the apoenzyme structure the main-chain of Pro-87 and Ser-88 is positioned such that the S1 binding pocket is narrower than that seen in the acyl-enzyme inhibitor-bound structure (Figs. 1 and 2). The side chain of Phe-84 has also rotated ∼80° about χ1, toward the direction of the binding pocket (from −83° in the inhibitor-bound structure to −160° in the apoenzyme structure). Differences are also seen in the side-chain positions of Ile-144, Leu-95, and Tyr-143 (Fig. 1), which also result in a more narrow and shallow binding pocket (Fig.2). Molecular surface analysis of the binding pocket region (26Liang J. Edelsbrunner H. Woodward C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1884-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar) confirms quantitatively that both the area and the volume of the S1 binding pocket are smaller in the apoenzyme structure. The S1 binding site in the acyl-enzyme structure is the largest pocket on the SPase molecular surface with an area of 156.8 Å2 and a volume of 224.1 Å3. The S1 binding site in the apoenzyme structure is the third largest pocket on the SPase molecular surface with an area of 145.5 Å2 and a volume of 129.3 Å3. Another major difference in the active site is seen in the side-chain position of Ser-88, where χ1 is rotated by ∼180° from its position in the acyl-enzyme structure. The position of the Ser-88 hydroxyl group in the apoenzyme is consistent with its role in the formation of the SPase oxyanion hole and stabilization of the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate. Paetzel et al. (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) had previously proposed that the Ser-88 χ1 angle in the inhibitor-bound structure was a result of a clash with the inhibitors thiazoladine ring (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) and that in the absence of the bulky inhibitor, the Ser-88 β-hydroxyl may be able to contribute to the oxyanion stabilization. These structural findings are consistent with recently published mutagenesis and kinetic studies (18Carlos J.L. Klenotic P.A. Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C. Dalbey R.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7276-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which showed that the S88T mutant maintained near wild-type activity whereas the S88C and S88A mutations resulted in a 740-fold and >2440-fold reduction in activity, respectively. Sequence analysis reveals that SPases from Gram-negative bacteria and those from the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum contain a Ser at the 88 position (E. colinumbering). There is some precedent for a serine hydroxyl acting as a component of an oxyanion hole (in lipolytic enzymes such as cutinase, Ref. 33Nicolas A. Egmond M. Verrips C.T. de Vlieg J. Longhi S. Cambillau C. Martinez C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but SPase is the first characterized serine protease to utilize a side-chain hydroxyl in this manner. The crystal structure of the apoenzyme of SPase-(Δ2–75) reveals electron density and appropriate coordination for three water molecules near the active site region conserved in each of the four molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig.3 a). The water designated WAT1 is coordinated by Met-91 NH, Ser-88 O, and Leu-95 O. The water designated WAT2 is coordinated by Ile-144 NH. The water designated WAT3 is coordinated by Lys-145 Nζ. WAT1 was also present in the SPase acyl-enzyme inhibitor-bound structure (9Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). WAT2 AND WAT3 were not present in the acyl-enzyme inhibitor-bound structure as they would have been sterically displaced by the presence of the inhibitor (Fig.3 b). This suggests either WAT2 or WAT3 as the deacylating water, with the long lived stability of the penem inhibitor acyl-enzyme complex a result of displacement of the deacylating water. Inhibitors for TEM-1 β-lactamase have been designed based on this principle (34Strynadka N.C. Martin R. Jensen S.E. Gold M. Jones J.B. Nat. Struct.

A major truncated form with molecular weight close to the full-length C/EBPβ was originally shown in liver cells to activate transcription and was named liver-enriched transcription activating protein (LAP), while a small molecular weight form was shown to repress transcription in liver cells and was named liver-enriched transcription inhibitory protein (LIP) (14Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). LAP and LIP have been shown to express in other types of cells, and LIP is considered as a dominant negative mutant of C/EBPβ (15Liao J. Piwien-Pilipuk G. Ross S.E. Hodge C.L. Sealy L. MacDougald O.A. Schwartz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 315997-331604Google Scholar). Transient transfection of LIP has been shown to suppress COX-2 promoter activity (8Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role of C/EBPβ-LIP and C/EBPβ-LAP in regulating COX-2 expression has not been reported. The roles of other C/EBP isoforms in regulating COX-2 expression are also unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PMA caused changes in C/EBP isoform binding to COX-2 promoter regulatory elements, which result in a dynamic control of COX-2 expression. Our results show that PMA increased binding of full-length C/EBPβ (C/EBPβ-FL), C/EBPβ-LAP, and C/EBPβ-LIP to C/EBP and CRE sites while it reduced C/EBPδ level and its binding to the C/EBP site. Overexpression of C/EBPβ-LIP suppressed COX-2 promoter activity and protein expression by interfering with the activity of a transcription co-activator p300. cyclooxygenase-2 CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate liver-enriched activating protein liver-enriched inhibitory protein human foreskin fibroblasts cyclic AMP responsive element full-length C/EBPβ Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. In all experiments, 85–90% confluent HFF were serum-starved for 24 h prior to treatment with PMA. Luciferase expression vector pGL3 basic containing a COX-2 promoter region (−891/+9) was constructed as previously described (16Tazawa R., Xu, X-M., Wu, K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commu. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutation of C/EBP and CRE sites was previously described (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing C/EBPδ were generously provided by Dr. Steven McKnight. Plasmid expressing C/EBPβ was kindly provided by Dr. Philip Auron and was used as the template to generate C/EBPβ-LIP by PCR. For LIP synthesis, forward primer 5′-GACAAGCTTATGGCGGCGGGCTTCCCGTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GACCTCGAGCTAGCAGTGGCCGGAGGAGGC-3′ were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies. The PCR product was purified after double digestion withHindIII/XhoI and was cloned into theHindIII/XhoI sites of an expression vector pCMV-Tag2 (Stratagene). Plasmid expressing p300 was a gift from Dr. Joan Boyes. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing HFF with RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min after sonication. The supernatants were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer followed by boiling for 3 min. 20–50 μg of solubilized lysate proteins were separated on a 4–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween buffer, the blots were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against isoforms of C/EBPs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and COX-2 protein (Cayman). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was added, and the bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. As the conventional electrophoretic mobility shift assay is difficult to identify and quantify multiple C/EBP isoforms bound to a sequence-specific DNA probe, we developed a novel method by using streptavidin-coated beads to bind biotinated DNA probe, which was used to interact with nuclear extract proteins. After centrifugation, the pelleted beads were collected and washed, and proteins were eluted by loading buffer and separated by 4–15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were analyzed by Western blots. In the experiments here, we incubated 600 μg of nuclear extract proteins with 6 μg of biotinated COX-2-specific C/EBP sequence or CRE sequence (Integrated DNA Technologies) and 60 μl of 4% beaded agarose (Sigma) mixed with 70% slurry at room temperature for 1 h with shaking. The bead concentration was in excess to lessen binding of nuclear extract proteins to free biotinated probes. Beads were pelleted and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline for three times. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was done as described above. 5′-biotinated wild-type and mutated C/EBP sequences were: C/EBP wild-type, 5′-/biotin/ACCGGCTTACGCAATTTTTTTAAG-3′ and mutant, 5′-/biotin/ACCGGCGCGATAGCTTTTTTTAAG-3′. 5′-biotinated wild-type and mutant CRE sequences were CRE wild-type, 5′-/biotin/CAGTCATTTCGTCACATGGG-3′, and mutant, 5′-/biotin/CAGTCATCGAGTCACATGGG-3′. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HFF by a method previously described (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This novel DNA-protein binding assay had much less nonspecific binding than electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Transfection of HFF with a pGL3 luciferase expression vector containing COX-2 5′-flanking DNA fragment −891 to +9 was carried out as previously described (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The expressed luciferase activity was determined in a luminometer. Cotransfection of pGL3-COX-2 promoter with C/EBP-containing plasmids was done by mixing 1 μg of pGL3-COX-2 promoter and 0.5 μg of C/EBP isoform plasmid DNA with 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and the mixture was added to each well of HFF in a 6-well plate. After incubation for 8 h, the cells were washed twice with fresh medium and incubated in fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 18 h. Cells were washed and incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h. The quiescent cells were treated with PMA (100 nm) or control vehicle for 4 h, and luciferase activity was measured. Consistent with previously reported results (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), PMA induced a significant amount of COX-2 protein in HFF after a 4-h treatment accompanied by a significant induction of the promoter activity (Fig.1 A). Since the C/EBP isoform protein levels in HFF have not been previously reported, we determined all six isoforms of C/EBP by Western blot analysis. A basal level of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were detected in unstimulated HFF (Fig. 1 B) but C/EBPγ, C/EBPε, and C/EBPζ were undetectable (data not shown). Two isoforms of C/EBPα, the 42-kDa full-length and a 30-kDa truncated form, and three isoforms of C/EBPβ, the 46-kDa full-length (C/EBPβ-FL), a 41-kDa C/EBPβ-LAP, and a 16-kDa C/EBPβ-LIP, were expressed in unstimulated cells (Fig.1 B). C/EBPδ was detected as a single 36-kDa protein (Fig.1 B). After PMA treatment for 4 h, there was a significant reduction of C/EBPδ protein levels, while neither C/EBPα nor C/EBPβ isoforms were altered (Fig. 1 B). The CRE site (−59/−53) and C/EBP site (−132/−125) at the 5′-untranslated region of COX-2 genes are essential for PMA-induced promoter activity. 2K. Schroer, M. A. Saunders, X.-M. Xu, Y. Zhu, J. Meyer-Kirchrath, and K. K. Wu, unpublished data. To evaluate the involvement of C/EBP isoforms in COX-2 promoter function, we determined binding of a COX-2-specific C/EBP or CRE sequence to C/EBP isoforms in nuclear extracts prepared from HFF treated with or without PMA for 4 h. In unstimulated cells, C/EBPδ was the predominant isoform bound to C/EBP probe (Fig.2 A). C/EBPβ-LIP binding was also detected. PMA treatment resulted in a reduction in C/EBPδ and an increase in C/EBPβ-LIP, C/EBPβ-FL (46 kDa), and C/EBPβ-LAP binding. Binding of all three isoforms of C/EBPβ was abrogated when a C/EBP mutant replaced the wild-type C/EBP as the probe (Fig.2 A). PMA did not induce C/EBPα binding to the C/EBP site. There was basal binding of C/EBPβ isoforms and C/EBPδ to COX-2-specific CRE probes in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2 B). PMA increased C/EBPβ-LAP and C/EBPβ-LIP binding to the CRE site without changing the binding of C/EBPδ (Fig. 2 B). There was no detectable C/EBPα binding to the CRE site (data not shown). These results suggest that COX-2 expression is regulated by a dynamic change in binding of C/EBP isoforms to the C/EBP and CRE sites of the COX-2 promoter. To discern the relationship of C/EBP isoform binding and COX-2 expression, we measured the kinetics of COX-2 protein levels, C/EBP isoform levels, and C/EBP binding to C/EBP and CRE probes in cells treated with PMA. COX-2 proteins were detectable at 2 h and increased with time after PMA treatment (Fig. 3). C/EBPβ isoforms were not significantly changed over time, while the C/EBPδ level was reduced with time (Fig. 3). The COX-2 protein increase was concordant with a time-dependent reduction in C/EBPδ levels, a reduction in C/EBPδ binding to the C/EBP probe (Fig.4 A), and an increase in C/EBPβ-LAP, -FL, and -LIP binding (Fig. 4 B) despite a lack of change in C/EBPβ isoform levels (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the interpretation that PMA increased C/EBPβ binding through post-translational modification of C/EBPβ (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Results from this study further revealed a reduction in C/EBPδ binding to the C/EBP site because of suppression of C/EBPδ protein expression by PMA. There was also a time-dependent increase in binding of C/EBPβ isoforms to the CRE (Fig.5 A) while there was no significant time-dependent change in C/EBPδ binding to the CRE site (Fig. 5 B).Figure 4Time course of C/EBP isoform binding to C/EBP probes.

C/EBPδ overexpression (Fig. 6 A) increased basal level without suppressing PMA-induced COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, C/EBPβ-FL overexpression had no significant effect on basal or PMA-induced COX-2 promoter activity (Fig. 6 B). We suspected that inhibition of COX-2 promoter by C/EBP-LIP overexpression may be attributed to its interfering with binding of C/EBPβ-LAP to C/EBP or the CRE site. To our surprise, C/EBPβ-LIP overexpression did not inhibit binding of C/EBPβ-LAP but instead increased basal and PMA-induced C/EBPβ-LAP binding to the C/EBP site (Fig. 7 A) and the CRE site (Fig. 7 B). Overexpression of C/EBPδ increased the basal binding of C/EBPβ-LAP and C/EBPβ-LIP to the C/EBP site (Fig.8 A) and the CRE site (Fig.8 B) and basal binding of C/EBPδ to the C/EBP site (Fig.8 A). Interestingly, its binding to the C/EBP site was significantly reduced in PMA-treated cells despite its overexpression (Fig. 8 A). C/EBPδ overexpression did not influence δ binding to the CRE site (Fig. 8 B).Figure 8Influence of C/EBP δ overexpression on β and δ binding to C/EBP sequence (A) and CRE sequence (B). Each figure is representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since C/EBPβ-LIP did not block binding of C/EBPβ-LAP and yet suppressed COX-2 promoter activity induced by PMA, we suspected that C/EBPβ-LIP overexpression may act at the level of interaction between DNA-bound C/EBPβ-LAP and co-activator p300. Transfection of cells with p300 plasmids increased basal and PMA-induced COX-2 promoter activity (Fig.9). This increase was completely abrogated by overexpression of C/EBPβ-LIP (Fig. 9). In agreement with the COX-2 promoter results, overexpression of C/EBPβ-LIP by transient transfection reduced COX-2 protein levels induced by PMA (Fig. 10), while neither C/EBPβ-FL nor C/EBPδ overexpression altered the basal or PMA-stimulated COX-2 protein levels (data not shown). However, unlike the promoter data, p300 overexpression did not increase basal COX-2 protein level and increased PMA-induced COX-2 protein expression to a lesser extent than the promoter activity (Fig. 10). We suspect that the difference between promoter and protein stimulation by p300 is due to an artificially high luciferase activity expressed by the transfected naked DNA. Nevertheless, COX-2 protein levels induced by PMA plus p300 overexpression were suppressed by cotransfection with C/EBPβ-LIP (Fig. 10). Results from this study indicate that PMA induces a dynamic switch of C/EBP isoform binding to C/EBP and CRE sites on the 5′-untranslated region of COX-2 promoter, thereby stimulating COX-2 promoter activity. PMA causes three key switches: 1) increased binding of C/EBPβ-LAP to C/EBP and CRE sites; 2) reduced binding of C/EBPδ to the C/EBP site; and 3) increased C/EBPβ-LIP binding to C/EBP and CRE sites. Increased binding of C/EBPβ-LAP to these two regulatory elements plays a key role in transactivation of COX-2 promoter, while increased C/EBPβ-LIP binding provides a negative regulation of COX-2 promoter activity. The role of C/EBPδ in this chain of events is less clear. Our data suggest that it is involved in the control of basal COX-2 promoter activity. Its binding to the C/EBP site is correlated with the protein level. When its protein expression is aberrantly augmented, such as in skin carcinogenesis, it causes an autonomous COX-2 protein expression that contributes to cancer growth (17Kim Y. Fischer S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27686-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). PMA reduced C/EBPδ protein levels, and this reduction resulted in a reduced binding of C/EBPδ to the C/EBP site. It is unclear whether the effect of PMA is at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level of C/EBPδ expression. That PMA also reduced C/EBPδ binding in δ-overexpression driven by a viral promoter suggests that PMA might accelerate C/EBPδ degradation. Reduced C/EBPδ binding due to a lower C/EBPδ protein level coupled with an increased C/EBPβ-LAP binding is likely to be pivotal for COX-2 induction by PMA and other stimuli signaling via the protein kinase C pathway. It is interesting to note that C/EBPδ binding to the CRE site was not reduced despite a reduced C/EBPδ level and an increased C/EBPβ-LAP binding to this site. This result suggests that following stimulation by PMA, the affinity of C/EBPβ-LAP binding to the C/EBP site is greatly enhanced, which leads to displacement of C/EBPδ from the C/EBP site. PMA increased the binding of all three isoforms of C/EBPβ to C/EBP and CRE sites without increasing their protein expression. A previous study showed that PMA induced phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, and the phosphorylated C/EBPβ exhibited an increased DNA binding activity (18Trautwein C. Caelles C. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Our recent study showed that dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ resulted in a marked reduction of C/EBPβ binding to C/EBP site on COX-2 promoter (10Saunders M.A. Sansores-Garcia L. Gilroy D.W. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18897-18904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C does not phosphorylate C/EBPβ directly (18Trautwein C. Caelles C. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) but mitogen-activated protein kinase, calcium-dependent calmodulin kinase II, and ribosomal S6 kinase can directly phosphorylate C/EBPβ at different serine/threonine residues (19Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 20Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell. 1999; 4: 1087-1092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It is unclear as to which kinase phosphorylates C/EBPβ, thereby increasing its binding activity in response to exogenous stimulation by inflammatory or mitogenic factors. It is also unknown whether C/EBPβ-LIP binding depends on phosphorylation. C/EBPβ-LIP retains the C-terminal DNA binding domain and the leucine zipper region but loses the N-terminal transactivation domain of C/EBPβ-FL or C/EBPβ-LAP (14Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). It can form a homodimer or heterodimer with C/EBPβ-LAP or C/EBPβ-FL and bind to C/EBP or CRE site. Our results suggest that it can also form a heterodimer with C/EBPδ and bind to the CRE site. Results from our transient transfection experiment are consistent with previous reports that C/EBPβ-LIP suppresses COX-2 promoter activity induced by exogenous stimuli (8Wadleigh D.J. Reddy S.T. Kopp E. Ghosh S. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6259-6266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that C/EBPβ-LIP suppresses COX-2 protein expression induced by PMA. Furthermore, we have provided a novel mechanism by which C/EBPβ-LIP blocked PMA-induced promoter activity and protein expression. C/EBPβ-FL/LAP has been reported to recruit p300 family co-activators to the promoter region through its direct interaction with the co-activator (22Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since C/EBPβ-LIP did not block the binding of C/EBPβ-FL/LAP, we reasoned that it may interfere with the interaction of p300 with C/EBPβ-FL/LAP. Our results show for the first time that overexpression of C/EBPβ-LIP abrogated the stimulatory effect of p300 on COX-2 promoter activity and protein expression. We speculate that the inhibitory effect of C/EBPβ-LIP is attributable to binding of an increasing amount of LIP homodimers and LIP/LAP heterodimer to the cognate site, which no longer interact with p300, and thus interfere with recruitment of transcription machinery to the TATA region for RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription. In summary, we have provided several novel aspects of COX-2 promoter stimulation by PMA. 1) Increased C/EBPβ-LAP binding to C/EBP and CRE sites plays a pivotal role in COX-2 transcriptional activation. 2) Sequence-specific binding of C/EBPβ-LAP recruits p300 for initiation of COX-2 transcription. 3) Concurrent increase in C/EBPβ-LIP binding to these two sites interferes with C/EBP-LAP interaction with p300 and provides a dynamic control of COX-2 promoter function.

Both domains are cysteine-rich, having 10 and 6 cysteines in the Fz and heparin-binding domains, respectively. In this study, the disulfide linkages of recombinant sFRP-1 were determined. Numbering sFRP-1 cysteines sequentially from the N terminus, the five disulfide linkages in the Fz domain are 1–5, 2–4, 3–8, 6–10, and 7–9, consistent with the disulfide pattern determined for homologous domains of several other proteins. The disulfide linkages of the heparin-binding domain are 11–14, 12–15, and 13–16. This latter set of assignments provides experimental verification of one of the disulfide patterns proposed for netrin (NTR) modules and thereby supports the prediction that the C-terminal heparin-binding domain of sFRP-1 is an NTR-type domain. Interestingly, two subsets of sFRPs appear to have alternate disulfide linkage patterns compared with sFRP-1, one of which involves the loss of a disulfide due to deletion of a single cysteine from the NTR module, whereas the remaining cysteine may pair with a new cysteine introduced in the Fz domain of the protein. Analysis of glycosylation sites showed that sFRP-1 contains a relatively large carbohydrate moiety on Asn172 (∼2.8 kDa), whereas Asn262, the second potential N-linked glycosylation site, is not modified.

Although the Wnt binding of sFRPs is generally believed to be mediated by the Fz CRD, interaction between Wingless (Drosophilaortholog of mammalian Wnt1) and a sFRP-1 mutant lacking the CRD imply that other mechanisms of direct or indirect interaction also exist (47Uren A.

The C-terminal heparin-binding portion of sFRPs bears weak homology with netrins (36Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M.

Jessell T.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1994; 78: 409-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). Originally, this potential relationship was based on the presence of clusters of positively charged residues and a few other conserved amino acids distributed over a span of ∼50 amino acids in FrzB/sFRP-3 (36Leyns L. Bouwmeester T. Kim S.H. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). More recently, Bányai and Patthy (49Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) identified a netrin (NTR) module in the C-terminal domains of netrins, sFRPs, type I procollagen C-proteinase enhancer proteins (PCOLCEs), complement proteins C3, C4, and C5, and in the N-terminal domains of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). This homology was based on related patterns of six conserved cysteines, several conserved segments of hydrophobic residues, and a correlation between predicted and known secondary structure in some of the proteins having the domain. However, experimentally determined disulfide bond assignments for the cysteine residues were only available for TIMPs and complement protein C3, the latter being a variant in the group that contains only four of the conserved cysteines. Thus, the validity of the proposed NTR module would be reinforced if the disulfide structure of another protein containing the putative domain conformed to the predicted scheme. In this study, we characterized the post-translational processing of sFRP-1. The linkages of the eight disulfide bonds and the site ofN-linked glycosylation in sFRP-1 were determined using MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing of purified peptides. The data show that sFRP-1 has two distinct domains with 10 and 6 cysteines in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. The N-terminal domain has a pattern of disulfide linkages identical to that of the Fz CRD recently defined in rat tyrosine kinase Ror-1, mouse sFRP-3, and mouse Fz8 (50Roszmusz E. Patthy A.

Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The assignment of disulfides in the C-terminal domain experimentally validates the primary disulfide pattern predicted for NTR modules (49Bányai L. Patthy L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition, these results provide the first complete experimental assignment of disulfide linkages in an sFRP recombinant protein containing both a CRD and an NTR domain in tandem. An interesting aspect of this assignment is that two other subsets of sFRPs are likely to have different disulfide linkages compared with sFRP-1, suggesting that shuffling of several disulfide bonds may have occurred during evolution of this protein family. Trypsin (sequencing grade) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Subtilisin was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP) was obtained from Pierce. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr) was obtained from Aldrich. Reagents for PAGE were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were either high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade or the highest quality analytical reagent grades available. Recombinant human sFRP-1 was purified from MDCK cell culture supernatants as described previously (47Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). CNBr was used for initial fragmentation of sFRP-1 for disulfide assignments because the intact unreduced protein was unusually resistant to cleavage by all proteases tested. Acetic acid (5% final concentration) was added to purified sFRP-1 (1.81 mg/2 ml), and the protein was desalted on an Econo-Pac10DG desalting column (Bio-Rad) using 5% acetic acid to elute the protein. Fractions containing protein were pooled, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 88% formic acid followed by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of CNBr over the Met content. After overnight incubation in the dark at room temperature under argon, the sample was lyophilized twice and redissolved in 500 μl of 7 m urea, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 50 mm glycine, pH 6.5. The CNBr fragments were separated by HPLC gel filtration using two TSK columns G3000 SWXL and G2000 SWXL connected in series with a 10 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 7 m urea, pH 6.5, buffer at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. CNBr fragments were further digested with subtilisin in 3 m urea, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 50 mm glycine, and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5 at enzyme:substrate ratios (w/w) of 1:3 (for C2 and C3) or 1:9 (for C1) at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.7%, pH ∼2. Peptides were separated by reversed phase (RP) HPLC on a ZORBAX 300SB-C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, Hewlett-Packard) using a System Gold HPLC (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A linear gradient was applied using solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 95% acetonitrile). Where required, subtilisin digests were reduced prior to RP-HPLC by adding an equal volume of 20 mm TCEP in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and 1.7% trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration) was then added prior to injection onto the HPLC column. TCEP partial reduction of peptide complexes containing multiple disulfides was performed as described previously (52Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The purified peptide complex (160 pmol/50 μl in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mm TCEP in 50 mm citrate, pH 3.2, and incubated for 3 min at 22 °C. Alkylation of peptides was performed by adding the TCEP-reduced peptide solution into an equal volume of 1 m iodoacetamide in 200 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.3% trifluoroacetic acid (final concentration). Automated Edman sequencing was performed using an Applied Biosystems model 494 protein sequencer as described previously (53Reim D.F. Speicher D.W. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.10.1-11.10.38Google Scholar). Molecular mass analysis was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry using a Voyager DE-PRO mass spectrometer (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Data were acquired either in linear or reflector mode using either external or internal calibration with protein A (44,614 Da), ubiquitin (8567.49 Da), insulin β chain (3496.96 Da), and bradykinin (1061.24 Da). When necessary, samples were desalted using C18 Ziptips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) followed by elution with a small volume of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The intact protein and large peptides were mixed 1:1 with a saturated solution of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapinic acid, Sigma) in 33% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for MALDI-MS analysis. Peptides <5-kDa from CNBr fragmentation and subtilisin digestion were applied to MS sample plates precoated with a saturated solution of nitrocellulose and α-cyano-4-hydoxycinnamic acid (1:4 w/w) in 2-propanol and acetone (1:1 v/v) as described previously (54Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Where required, CNBr fragments and RP-HPLC samples (20 μl) were reduced in 10 volumes of 2 mm TCEP, 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by desalting on ZipTips to remove the TCEP and ammonium bicarbonate. Single amino acid substitutions were introduced with sFRP-1/pcDNA3.1 (47Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S. Rubin J.S. J. Biol.

N172Q and N262Q were generated, respectively, with the following primer pairs: GCCATGACGCCGCCCCAAGCCACCGAAGCCTCC (forward)/GGAGGCTTCGGTGGCTTGGGGCGGCGTCATGGC (reverse); and CCCTGCCACCAGCTGGACCAACTCAGCCACCACTTCCTC (forward)/GAGGAAGTGGTGGCTGAGTTGGTCCAGCTGGTGGCAGGG (reverse). The underlined letters indicate the location of mutations introduced to modify the sequence. DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the intended substitutions and ensure the absence of random mutations at any other sites. Recombinant expression and protein purification were performed as described previously for wild-type sFRP-1 (47Uren A. Reichsman F. Anest V. Taylor W.G. Muraiso K. Bottaro D.P. Cumberledge S.

Recombinant sFRP-1 was purified from MDCK cell culture supernatant by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified protein migrated on SDS-PAGE with an apparent mass of ∼35 kDa (Fig.1 A). MALDI-MS analysis of purified sFRP-1 showed a single broad peak with an average mass (MH+) of 35,452 Da. N-terminal sequence analysis of sFRP-1 indicated that the majority of the polypeptide chains began with Ser31, whereas ∼10% and ∼7% of the sample began with Asp41 and Phe50, respectively (Fig.2). MALDI-MS analyses of tryptic peptides revealed the predominant C terminus of sFRP-1 to be Phe312, although trace amounts of the protein with C termini at Gln309, Ser310, Phe308, Val311, and Lys313 were observed (data not shown). Because the calculated amino acid sequence mass of sFRP-1(Ser31–Phe312) is 32,394 Da, the difference between observed and calculated mass suggested the molecule was glycosylated where the major species had ∼3000 Da of carbohydrate mass. The broad MS peak shape was consistent with heterogeneity of the putative carbohydrate moiety and heterogeneous proteolytic processing of the N and C termini described above.Figure 2Amino acid sequence of sFRP-1 summarizing experimentally determined disulfide linkages,N-glycosylation sites, and proteolysis processing. The predominant N- and C-terminal processing is indicated by solid arrows at Ser31 and Phe312, respectively. Minor alternative heterogeneous N termini resulting from proteolytic processing at Asp41 and Phe50 are indicated by dashed arrows. Bold linesbetween cysteines indicate assigned disulfide bonds. The glycosylatedN-linked site on Asn172 is indicated by asolid underline and the unmodified site at Asn262 is indicated by a dashed underline. The CNBr cleavage sites are indicated by m.

Masses corresponding to both methionine derivatives were observed for most peptides. For simplicity, only masses corresponding to the predominant homoserine lactone form are reported (residue mass = 83.04 Da), and these residues are indicated as Metxxx when peptide sequences are described. The CNBr fragments were separated by HPLC gel filtration, and major peaks/pools were designated by C1 to C6 as shown in Fig.3 A. The protein bands observed in fractions C1, C2, and C3 on nonreducing gels shifted to lower molecular weight positions on reducing gels, which indicated these fractions contained disulfide linkages (Fig. 3, B andC). MALDI-MS of C1 showed a single broad peak with an average mass of 30,428.7 Da prior to reduction, whereas masses corresponding to Ser31–Met75, Ala87–Met143, and a weak signal for Lys301–Phe312 were observed after reduction (Table I). Comparisons of SDS gel bands and masses of C1, C2, and C3 showed that Met168 had not been cleaved in C1 resulting in isolation of a single large unreduced complex containing all disulfide-linked peptides. This incompletely fragmented CNBr peptide was not directly identified in the MS analysis apparently due to a combination of its large size and the glycosylated moiety on this fragment that interfered with ionization of the peptide after reduction (see below). The C2 peptide complex contained the six cysteines from the heparin-binding (NTR) domain in three polypeptide chains as follows: glycosylated Thr169–Met210, Lys211–Met270, and Lys301–Phe312, which confirmed the major C terminus of the protein was Phe312. The C3 peptide complex contained the 10 cysteines from the Fz CRD domain in three polypeptide chains: Ser31–Met75, Ala87–Met143, and Leu154–Met168. The C4 to C6 peptide fractions did not contain any cysteine residues and were determined to be Gly271–Met297, Gln144–Met153, and Val76–Met86, respectively. Peaks C1 to C3 were further analyzed as described below to determine the disulfide linkages of sFRP-1.Table IMALDI-MS analyses of CNBr-fragmented complexesPeptide fractionAssignmentPeptide mass1-aAverage masses of single-charged molecules (MH)+.CommentsObservedCalculated1-bCalculated mass of each peptide includes mass of homoserine lactone generated by cleavage of C-terminal methionine.C1 complex(Contains all 16 cysteines)Incomplete CNBr fragmentation{31S–M75}–{87A–M143}–{C-terminal fragments}1-cBraces indicate a single peptide and the cysteines in the peptide are indicated with their location in the sequence as superscripts.30,428.7—C1 complex-reduced{31S–M75}5170.85170.9{87A–M143}6377.36377.6{301K–F312}1437.31437.6{C-terminal fragments}——Not observedC2 complex{C185,C188,C202}–{C255,C257}–{C305}C-terminal heparin-binding domain{169T–M210+glycosylation}–{211K–M270}–{301K–F312}15,609.7—C2 complex-reduced{211K–M270}6885.86884.5{301K–F312}1437.81437.6{169T–M210+glycosylation}7266.44454.1Δ = 2812.3 Da1-dMass increment of 2,812.3 Da is presumably due t"
https://openalex.org/W2052494567,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been reported to exert an acute potentiation of synaptic activity. Here we examined the action of BDNF on synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in cultured cerebral cortical neurons prepared from postnatal 2–3-day-old rats. The synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations began at approximately DIV 5. It was revealed that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors were involved in the synchronous spontaneous oscillatory activity. BDNF potentiated the frequency of these oscillations. The BDNF-potentiated activity reached 207 ± 20.1% of basal oscillatory activity. NT-3 and NT-4/5 also induced the potentiation. However, nerve growth factor did not. We examined the correlation between BDNF-induced glutamate release and the BDNF-potentiated oscillatory activity. Both up-regulation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) expression and the BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred at approximately DIV 5 when the BDNF-potentiated oscillations appeared. We confirmed that the BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred through a glutamate transporter that was dependent on the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway. Transporter inhibitors blocked the BDNF-potentiated oscillations, demonstrating that BDNF enhanced the glutamatergic transmissions in the developing cortical network by inducing glutamate release via a glutamate transporter.

However, nerve growth factor did not. We examined the correlation between BDNF-induced glutamate release and the BDNF-potentiated oscillatory activity. Both up-regulation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) expression and the BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred at approximately DIV 5 when the BDNF-potentiated oscillations appeared. We confirmed that the BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred through a glutamate transporter that was dependent on the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway. Transporter inhibitors blocked the BDNF-potentiated oscillations, demonstrating that BDNF enhanced the glutamatergic transmissions in the developing cortical network by inducing glutamate release via a glutamate transporter.

Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar), and several patterns of Ca2+ dynamics are known. Spontaneous oscillations in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration occur in developing CNS neurons, and their mechanisms are highly distinct. For example, the activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is involved in the oscillatory activity of the retina, whereas a depolarization through the GABAA receptors is required for hippocampal oscillatory activity. Retinal oscillations are spatially restricted to the domains of amacrine and ganglion cells (17Wong R.O. Chernjavsky A. Smith S.J. Shatz C.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 716-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 18Feller M.B. Wellis D.P. Stellwagen D. Werblin F.S. Shatz C.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). By contrast, hippocampal activity consists of transient bursts in the intracellular Ca2+ recurring synchronously over the entire population of pyramidal and interneurons (19Garaschuk O. Hanse E. Konnerth A. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the cerebral cortex, several patterns of Ca2+ activity have been observed during cortical development, and the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), GABAA receptors, gap junctions, and ionotropic glutamate receptors are all able to mediate them. The Ca2+oscillations mediated by mGluR are triggered by mGluR agonists in neonatal or embryonic cortical mouse slices, and this Ca2+activity is not synchronized in any population of cells (20Flint A.C. Dammerman R.S. Kriegstein A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12144-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the early postnatal stage, GABAA receptor activation has been shown to be involved in Ca2+ oscillations, and again this Ca2+ activity is not synchronized (21Owens D.F. Boyce L.H. Davis M.B. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6414-6423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gap junction-mediated propagation of Ca2+ waves is not required for synaptic transmission (22Yuste R. Nelson D.A. Rubin W.W. Katz L.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 7-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), but an IP3-related second messenger system acting via gap junctions is required for synaptic transmission (23Kandler K. Katz L.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1419-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the large neuronal networks in slices of newborn rats revealed synchronized Ca2+ oscillations. These Ca2+ activities are mediated by AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors and are maintained until the developmental transition of the GABAergic transmission from depolarization to hyperpolarization (24Garaschuk O. Linn J. Eilers J. Konnerth A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). On the other hand, very little is known about neurotrophin-dependent oscillatory activities in CNS neurons. A previous report has shown that BDNF potentiates the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in cultured hippocampal neurons (25Sakai N. Yamada M. Numakawa T. Ogura A. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which BDNF potentiates the oscillatory activity remains unclear. In the present study, we identified how BDNF potentiates synchronized spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. We present the hypothesis that the BDNF potentiation of Ca2+ oscillations is mediated by glutamate, which is released in response to BDNF via a glutamate transporter. We propose that our system may be a useful tool for understanding how neurotrophins mediate the spontaneous synaptic transmission. Primary dissociated cultures were prepared from postnatal 2- or 3-day-old rat (SLC, Sizuoka, Japan) cortex as reported previously (26Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I. Brain Res. 1988; 467: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Numakawa T. Takei N. Yamagishi S. Sakai N. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were gently dissociated with a plastic pipette after digestion with papain (90 units/ml, Worthington) at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were plated at a final density of 4 or 5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated 12- and 24-well plates (4- and 2-cm2 surface area/wells, respectively; Corning). The culture medium consisted of 5% precolostrum newborn calf serum, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 1% rat serum, 89% of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4), 30 nmNa2SeO3, and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. Cells were stained with the anti-MAP2 (rabbit IgG, gift from Dr. H. Murofushi, University of Tokyo), anti-GLU (mouse monoclonal IgG, Sigma), and anti-glutaminase (mouse monoclonal IgM, a gift from Dr. T. Kaneko, Kyoto University) antibodies. Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.05% Triton X at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated overnight with anti-MAP2 (1:5000) or anti-GLU (1:1000) antibodies diluted with a 0.01% Triton X solution at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were applied at room temperature for 1 h. We used fluorescein isothiocyanate (Seikagaku Kogyo) or rhodamine (Vector Laboratories) secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:200. For staining with the anti-glutaminase antibody, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated with the anti-glutaminase antibody diluted 1:250 in a 0.3% Triton X solution. Anti-mouse IgM was used as a second antibody. For visualizing, we used a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) together with 0.02% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine 4-HCl (DAB) and 0.1% (w/v) (NH4)Ni(SO4)2dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), containing 0.01% (v/v) H2O2. Immunoreaction was observed with a Nikon DIAPHOT-TMD microscope. The amounts of amino acids released from the cultured cortical neurons were measured as described previously (27Numakawa T. Takei N. Yamagishi S. Sakai N. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amounts released into the assay buffer (modified HEPES-buffered Krebs Ringer solution: KRH containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) were measured by HPLC (BAS) with a fluorescence detector (CMA280, BAS). The high K+(HK+) solution consisted of 85 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The Ca2+-free solution was prepared by omitting the CaCl2. Na+-free solution was prepared by the addition of sucrose or LiCl instead of NaCl. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals in tubes and placed on ice by the batch method and then filtered with 0.22-μm membranes to remove cell debris. Next, the samples were treated with O-phthalaldehyde and 2-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 12 °C before being injected into the HPLC system and analyzed using a fluorescence monitor (excitation wavelength, 340 nm; emission wavelength, 445 nm). Xestospongin C (Calbiochem) an IP3 calcium channel receptor antagonist, was applied at 1 μm for 1 h before the assay. U-73122, a PLC-γ inhibitor, was applied for 1 h at 2 μm (28Jin W., Lo, T.M. Loh H.H. Thayer S.A. Brain Res. 1994; 642: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). LY294002 (Calbiochem), a PI3 kinase inhibitor, and PD98059 (Calbiochem), a MAP kinase inhibitor, were applied for 30 min at 50 and 10 μm, respectively (29Yano H. Agatsuma T. Nakanishi S. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Reiners J.J.Jr. Lee J.Y. Clift R.E. Dudley D.T. Myrand S.P. Mol.

When the effects of the various drugs on BDNF-induced glutamate release were examined, the neurons were washed three times, and samples of the basal and BDNF-induced release in the presence of these drugs were collected. BDNF, NT-3, NT-4/5, and NGF were applied by bath application. Cells were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated cover glasses (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiperm (IN VITRO, Kalkberg, Osterode). Cells were washed three times with KRH and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 μm Fluo-3 AM diluted in KRH. The cells were then washed, and the cover glasses placed on an inverted microscope (TMD-300, Nikon). The dye intensity was monitored using a confocal laser microscope (RCM 8000, Nikon). Neurons were irradiated with an excitation blue light beam (488 nm) produced by an argon ion laser at a scanning frequency of one-thirtieth of a second. The emitted fluorescence was guided through a ×40 water-immersion objective to a pinhole diaphragm at 520 nm using a diachronic mirror. The intensity of emission from each neuron targeted was scanned at one-thirtieth of a second intervals with a monitor video enhancer. BAPTA-AM (100 nm) (Research Biochemicals) and thapsigargin (1 μm) (Research Biochemicals) were added 30 min prior to the application of BDNF. Xestospongin C (1 μm) and U-73122 (2 μm) were added 30 min prior to the imaging assay. dl-TBOA and t-PDC were applied 20 min before the assay at 10 μm respectively. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were boiled for 3 min, and then clarified by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 8 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatants was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and then 10-μg aliquots of protein were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore) in 0.1m Tris base, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol using a semi-dry electrophoretic transfer system. The membranes were blocked with 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (T-TBS) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then probed with 1:500 dilution of anti-phospho-Trk antibody, 1:1000 of anti-Trk antibody, 1:1000 anti-PLC-γ antibody or 1:1500 of anti-phospho-Tyr antibody in T-TBS containing 1% nonfat dried milk at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with T-TBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc. or Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and diluted 1:1000 with T-TBS at room temperature for 1 h. They were then washed at least four times with T-TBS and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences or Immunostar, Wako). The cell lysates for immunoprecipitation assay were prepared using Triton lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 0.5 mm phenylarsine oxide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, 250-μg aliquots of protein were mixed with 1 μg of anti-PLC-γ antibody and the samples incubated at 4 °C for at least 3 h. Protein G-Sepharose (10 μl of gel) was then added and the mixtures rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The immune complexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 1 min before being washed three times with the Triton buffer. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were immunoblotted with anti-phospho-Tyr antibody. The anti-phospho-Trk antibody (31Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) was purchased from New England Biolabs, whereas the anti-phospho-Tyr and anti-p85 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology. The anti-PLC-γ, anti-Trk (32Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), and anti-MAPK antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. During the development of cultured neurons obtained from neonatal rat cerebral cortex, networks among neurons were formed, and after this synchronized spontaneous Ca2+ oscillatory activity appeared in the cultured cortical neurons. The synchronous Ca2+ oscillations in developing neurons seemed to indicate the formation of chemical synapses. To investigate the acute effect of BDNF on spontaneous neuronal activities in cultured CNS neurons, we focused on the BDNF-induced elevation in the frequency of synchronized spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in cultured cortical neurons. First, we characterized the cortical spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations. The changes of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in the cultured cells during neuronal development are shown (Fig. 1,A and B). Fig. 1, A and B, respectively, gives the results from two independent series of developmental experiments. The synchronous spontaneous Ca2+oscillations begun at around DIV 5 in cultured neurons prepared from P2–3-day-old rats (Fig. 1, A and B). At DIV 6 or DIV 7, the frequencies of the Ca2+ oscillations were greater than in cultured neurons at DIV 5. The synchronous Ca2+ oscillations were observed in both neurites and soma, and the time-dependence of the oscillations in the cell bodies was similar to that in neurites (Fig. 1, C and D). Although some cells in culture did not show oscillatory activities (Fig. 1 D, c4), in this study, we focused on the synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ oscillatory activity. The quantitative data of intracellular Ca2+ were obtained from the analysis of each cell body targeted, because we could detect a much higher intensity of Ca2+ dye emission in cell bodies than in neurites. The cells that showed synchronized activity were clearly defined. To identify which cell population displays the activity, we performed an immunocytochemical staining study using anti-GLU, anti-glutaminase (a marker for glutamatergic neurons) and anti-MAP2 (a marker for neurons) antibodies after the Ca2+ imaging experiment. We confirmed that the cells in synchronized Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.2 A, aandb) were MAP2 positive (Fig. 2 A, c), indicating that they were neurons. Almost all of the neurons showing oscillations could be labeled with anti-GLU (Fig. 2 A,d). Further, we confirmed that cortical neurons displaying oscillations (Fig. 2 A, e and f) express glutaminase and this immunoreactivity was observed in the axons of neurons (Fig. 2 A, g), indicating that they were glutamatergic neurons (33Kaneko T. Kang Y. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8362-8377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of glutamate receptors and voltage-dependent Ca2+channels in the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, several antagonists were applied. Cd2+, a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, reduced the Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2 B, a). APV (a NMDA receptor inhibitor, 10 μm) and CNQX (an AMPA receptor inhibitor, 10 μm) also blocked the Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 2 B,b). In an extracellular Ca2+-free condition, no spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were observed (Fig.2 B, c). TTX (a Na+ channel blocker) also abolished the oscillations (Fig. 2 B, d). In contrast, the GABA receptor antagonists, bicuculline (10 μm) and/or saclofen (10 μm) did not block the spontaneous Ca2+ activity. The frequency of oscillations at DIV 6 in the presence of both bicuculline and saclofen was 109 ± 13.1% of nontreated basal activity. These results suggested that voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and ionotropic glutamate receptors were involved in the synchronous spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations of cultured cortical neurons. To test the possibility that BDNF enhanced the synaptic connectivity, we examined the acute action of BDNF on the spontaneous Ca2+ activity. Application of BDNF potentiated the frequency of the synchronous Ca2+oscillations at DIV 6 (Fig.3 A, top). Although in some cases, we observed a resting cortical culture at around DIV 5 or later, BDNF was still capable of triggering continuous Ca2+ oscillations in the resting neurons (data not shown). In contrast, at DIV 3 BDNF induced a transient increase in intracellular Ca2+, but it did not initiate continuous Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3 A, bottom), indicating that the BDNF-potentiated Ca2+ oscillations in cultured cortical neurons required in vitro maturation. The BDNF-potentiated Ca2+ oscillations were sustained for 15–20 min (Fig. 3 B). In some cases, the oscillatory activity was sustained for longer (40 min). NT-3 and NT-4/5 also potentiated the activity, but NGF did not (Fig. 3 C). BDNF and NT-4/5 enhanced the oscillatory activity by the same amount degree. The effect of NT-3 was less than that of BDNF. In the presence of K252a, BDNF did not potentiate the Ca2+ oscillations, although K252a alone did not influence the basal activity (Fig.3 C). Cortical neurons are known to express TrkB and TrkC but not TrkA receptors. As expected, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 significantly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk receptors (Fig. 3 D), but NGF did not. These results strongly suggested that the neurotrophin-potentiated Ca2+ oscillations required the Trk activation. It was revealed that the cortical spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were mediated by glutamate. Previously, we showed that BDNF triggered a rapid glutamate release from the neurons. To test for a correlation between the two phenomena, we examined the BDNF-induced glutamate release during neuronal development (Fig. 4 A). BDNF did not induce glutamate release in early cultured cortical neurons (at DIV 3 and 4). On the other hand, after 5 days in vitro culture or more (DIV 6–9), BDNF induced significant glutamate release within 1 min after exogenous application. These results indicated that the two phenomena, the BDNF-potentiated Ca2+ oscillations and the BDNF-induced glutamate release, occurred over the same period ofin vitro maturation. The HK+-evoked glutamate release was also observed at DIV 5 or later. The extent of HK+-evoked glutamate release was greater than that of the BDNF-induced one at DIV 7 and DIV 9. If glutamate release induced by BDNF modulates the Ca2+oscillations frequency, then an increase in the concentration of glutamate in the extracellular solution should shift the concentration dependence of the BDNF-potentiated effect on the oscillations. BDNF at 5 ng/ml alone induced transient Ca2+ increases but rarely potentiated the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.4 B, c). Glutamate (1 μm) also triggered transient Ca2+ increases without any frequency potentiation (Fig. 4 B, b). However, in the presence of glutamate (1 μm) and 5 ng/ml BDNF, the oscillatory activity was potentiated to the same level as that induced by BDNF alone at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 4 B, d ande). In contrast, the oscillations induced by co-application of glutamate (1 μm) with BDNF at 100 ng/ml did not result in any further potentiation over that produced by 100 ng/ml of BDNF alone (Fig. 4 C). These results suggested that the BDNF-potentiated spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations were indeed because of the BDNF-induced glutamate release. Application of glutamate at higher concentrations (50 or 100 μm) induced a burst of intracellular Ca2+ increases and resulted in termination of the spontaneous oscillations (data not shown). Thus, we compared the sensitivities to BDNF (5 or 100 ng/ml) with or without glutamate (1 μm). We previously reported that the BDNF-induced glutamate release from cultured cortical neurons was dependent on intracellular Ca2+ (34Takei N. Numakawa T. Kozaki S. Sakai N. Endo Y. Takahashi M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27620-27624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and that the PLC-γ/IP3 pathway was essential for the glutamate release in cultured cerebellar neurons (35Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, we confirmed the Ca2+dependence of the BDNF-induced release in cultured cortical neurons. In the extracellular Ca2+-free condition, BDNF was still able to induce the glutamate release. On the other hand, BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca2+ chelator) or thapsigargin (which causes a depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ pools) completely abolished the BDNF-induced release. Furthermore, we examined the PLC-γ/IP3 pathway contribution to the BDNF-induced release. Xestospongin C, a cell-permeable IP3 receptor antagonist, completely blocked the BDNF-induced release. U-73122, an inhibitor of PLC-γ, also blocked the release. On the other hand, PD98059, a MAP kinase inhibitor, and LY294002, a PI3 kinase inhibitor, had no effect (data not shown). These results suggested that the PLC-γ/IP3/Ca2+ pathway is essential for the BDNF-induced glutamate release from cultured cortical neurons as previously shown in cultured cerebellar neurons (35Numakawa T.

https://openalex.org/W1991428150,"DNA polymerase ε (pol ε) has been implicated in DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle control, but its precise roles are unclear. When the subcellular localization of human pol ε was examined by indirect immunofluorescence, pol ε appeared in discrete nuclear foci that colocalized with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) foci and sites of DNA synthesis only late in S phase. Early in S phase, pol ε foci were adjacent to PCNA foci. In contrast to PCNA foci that were only present in S phase, pol ε foci were present throughout mitosis and the G1 phase of cycling cells. It is hypothesized from these observations that pol ε and PCNA have separate but associated functions early in S phase and that pol ε participates with PCNA in DNA replication late in S phase.

Kaguni L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4265-4268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas pol δ is responsible for elongation, as most clearly demonstrated in SV40 DNA replication (2Lee S.H. Eki T. Hurwitz J.

DNA pol ε is well conserved in sequence and subunit composition among eukaryotes. Human pol ε has four subunits, a large catalytic subunit, p261, and three associated subunits, p59, p12, and p17 (11Syvaoja J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2489-2497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Likewise, Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol ε has a catalytic subunit of 256 kDa, POL2, and has three associated subunits encoded by DPB2, DPB3, DPB4 (8Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Morrison A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Sugino A.

Both catalytic subunits are divided into two domains linked by a protease-sensitive region, an N-terminal domain containing polymerase and exonuclease motifs and a 120-kDa C-terminal domain. The S. cerevisiae and human catalytic subunits are 39% identical overall and have 63% identity in the N-terminal domain (16Kesti T. Frantti H. Syvaoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10238-10245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p59 and DPB2p have 26% overall identity (17Li Y. Asahara H. Patel V.S. Zhou S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32337-32344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas p17 and p12 have 36.5 and 34% identity to Dpb4p and Dpb3p, respectively (12Li Y. Pursell Z.F. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23247-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Given the conservation of pol ε sequence and subunit structure between yeast and humans, it is likely that their functions are also largely conserved. A role for pol ε in chromosomal DNA replication has been established in higher eukaryotes and in yeast. The elongation step of DNA replication is impaired in Xenopus laevis egg extracts immunodepleted of pol ε (6Waga S. Masuda T. Takisawa H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, using a polymerase trap technique that tags a polymerase with its DNA product, Zlotkin et al. (5Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jiang Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanel T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) find that pol ε from monkey kidney cells associates with nascent chromosomal DNA but not nascent SV40 DNA. Likewise, a neutralizing antibody against human pol ε inhibits chromosomal replication when microinjected into human fibroblasts but fails to inhibit SV40 DNA replication in vitro (7Pospiech H. Kursula I. Abdel-Aziz W. Malkas L. Uitto L. Kastelli M. Vihinen-Ranta M. Eskelinen S. Syvaoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3799-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, disruptions of POL2 are lethal and result in the terminal dumbbell morphology characteristic of a defect in DNA replication (8Morrison A. Araki H. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1143-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). When shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, temperature-sensitive mutants of pol ε in S. cerevisiae do not complete DNA replication and arrest at or near the G2/M border with less than 2C of DNA (9Araki H. Ropp P.A. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Morrison A. Sugino A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Finally, temperature-sensitive mutants in the pol ε catalytic subunit of Schizosaccharomyces pombe arrest in S or G1 phase, implying that these cells could neither complete nor initiate a new round of replication (10D'Urso G. Nurse P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12491-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the essential function of the yeast pol ε catalytic subunit is not provided by the polymerase domain but rather by the 120 kDa C-terminal domain. Mutants for which the entire polymerase domain of the catalytic subunit of pol ε is deleted are viable, although their generation time is increased (18Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20Feng W. D'Urso G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4495-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the polymerase domain is dispensable for DNA replication when it is deleted, point mutations that render the intact protein catalytically inactive are lethal, suggesting that such mutants block other polymerases from substituting for pol ε function (19Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or titrate away factors that are necessary for DNA replication. pol ε has also been implicated in DNA repair. Both pol ε and pol δ can participate in nucleotide excision repair in vitro(21Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N. Protiac M. Heubscher U. Egly J.M. Wood R.D. Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar, 22Nichols A.F. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2441-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) or in vivo (23Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Heubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). pol ε has also been linked to recombinational repair, since a recombinational repair protein complex from calf thymus nuclei (RC-1) that catalyzes the transfer of intact donor DNA to a double-strand gap or deletion contains pol ε (24Jessberger R. Podust V. Heubscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InS. cerevisiae, which lacks pol β, pol ε has been implicated in base excision repair. Using extracts from temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase S. cerevisiae mutants in an in vitro base excision repair reaction, Wang et al. (25Wang Z. Wu X. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1051-1058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show that repair synthesis was reduced in extracts from pol ε mutants but not in extracts of pol α or pol δ mutants and that purified pol ε could restore this repair synthesis. Both pol δ and pol ε interact with the processivity factor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and at least on S. cerevisiae PCNA the sites of interaction differ (26Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of pol ε, the significance of this interaction is unclear because pol ε is very processive in the absence of PCNA; it can copy the entire genome of M13m18 in the absence of PCNA and its clamp loader, RFC, and RFA (27Chui G. Characterization of HeLa DNA Polymerase ε. University of California, Berkeley, CA1995Google Scholar). Human PCNA and pol ε can be co-immunoprecipitated by antibodies against pol ε from an in vitrotranscription/translation reaction but not from a HeLa crude cell-free extract (28Li Y. Associated Subunits of HeLa DNA Pol ε. University of California, Berkeley, CA1998Google Scholar). Moreover, human PCNA and pol ε do not form a stable complex in the presence of salt (4Lee S.H. Pan Z.Q. Kwong A.D. Burgers P.M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCNA does further increase the processivity of S. cerevisiae pol ε (29Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the primer recognition and elongation of calf thymus pol ε (30Maga G. Hubscher U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but PCNA slightly inhibits the activity of HeLa pol ε (31Syvaoja J. Suomensaari S. Nishida C. Goldsmith J.S. Chui G.S. Jain S. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition to roles in DNA replication and DNA repair, pol ε is involved in the sensing of DNA damage during S phase in S. cerevisiae. Mutations in the C terminus of the catalytic subunit of pol ε block the ability of cells to induce transcription of a ribonucleotide reductase gene (RNR3) in response to DNA damage or hydroxyurea (32Navas T.A. Zhou Z. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 29-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). These mutants also die rapidly when DNA replication is inhibited by hydroxyurea because they are defective in the ability to block mitosis in response to replication stress (33Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar); although at least for mec1 and rad53 mutants, this inviability in hydroxyurea is a result of the inability to complete replication rather than inappropriate anaphase entry (34Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2956-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In vitro, the pol ε holoenzyme dissociates from its DNA template upon the addition of single-stranded DNA (35Maki S. Hashimoto K. Ohara T. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21332-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting a mechanism for how pol ε is able to sense DNA damage or replication blocks.S. pombe pol ε may indirectly participate in the DNA damage response through an interaction withcid1+ . Only cdc20cid1 double mutants, but not either single mutant, show a substantial loss of viability and the appearance of the “cut” phenotype, which indicates aberrant entry into mitosis (36Wang S.W. Toda T. MacCallum R. Harris A.L. Norbury C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although human cells lack the amenable genetics of their yeast counterparts, they do provide the unique opportunity to study pol ε through its cellular localization because of their relatively large size. We examined the subcellular localization of human pol ε using fluorescence microscopy to study roles in DNA replication, DNA repair, and responses to DNA damage. Unlike PCNA, pol ε was found localized to distinct nuclear foci throughout the entire cell cycle. Early in S phase, pol ε foci did not colocalize with PCNA foci and newly replicated DNA but were adjacent or “neighbors” to these foci. However, pol ε foci did colocalize with PCNA foci and DNA synthesis later in S phase, suggesting that pol ε might participate with PCNA in DNA replication only late in S phase. IgG monoclonal antibodies raised against purified HeLa DNA polymerase ε were originally generated and characterized by Drs. G. Chui (27Chui G. Characterization of HeLa DNA Polymerase ε. University of California, Berkeley, CA1995Google Scholar) and P. H. Hwang (37Hwang P. Studies of Associated Proteins of DNA Polymerase ε from Human HeLa Cells. University of California, Berkeley, CA1995Google Scholar). Clones 3A3.2, recognizing the 261-kDa catalytic subunit (p261), and 3B4.12, recognizing the 59-kDa subunit (p59), were later subcloned. The resulting subclones were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 5% macrophage-conditioned medium with antibiotics (38Sugasawara R.J. Cahoon B.E. Karu A.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 79: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The antibodies were purified from the supernatants by ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein A- or G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) affinity chromatography (39Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 298-299Google Scholar). Antibodies were then dialyzed against PBS (2.67 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O) and stored at −20 °C. Antibodies against PCNA were from the PC10 clone and were either conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or unconjugated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Anti-pol α antibody (SJK-132–20) was purified as described above from supernatants harvested from hybridomas obtained from ATCC (CRL-1640). Secondary antibodies were either goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) and conjugated to Cy3 or fluorescein isothiocyanate. IMR-90 normal human diploid fibroblasts (Corielle Institute, #I90 PO4B), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 unless otherwise noted. For synchronization, the fibroblasts were grown until mid-log phase (∼2 days) in 100-mm dishes with (for immunofluorescence) or without (for flow cytometry) 12-mm glass coverslips to ensure similar cell densities for parallel flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle progression. Cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (tissue culture grade, Invitrogen) in the absence of serum for 24 h and then released in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 20 ng/ml nocodazole where noted. Coverslips were transferred to 24-well dishes for immunofluorescence staining. For UV irradiation, serum-starved cells were released into medium containing serum for 4 h for G1 phase cells or 22 h for S-phase cells. The cells were washed in PBS, reserving the release medium, and overlaid with PBS. After irradiation at 10 J/m2, the PBS was replaced with the reserved medium, and the cells were cultured until harvest at varying time points. For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were grown in 24-well tissue culture dishes on 12-mm round glass coverslips to mid-log phase (∼2 days) or until well confluent (∼2 weeks). The coverslips were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde from a 10% EM grade stock solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 12 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. 200 μl of primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin was added, and the coverslips were incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with similarly diluted secondary antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature in a dark humidified chamber. DAPI was added 30 min before the end of the secondary antibody incubation to a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. After washing three times with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in mounting medium (12 g of glycerol, 4.8 g of Mowiol (Calbiochem), 325 mg of n-propyl gallate, 24 ml of 200 mm Tris, pH 8.2, 12 ml of H2O), sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4 °C in the dark. Analysis was with a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescence microscope equipped with an Optronics DEI 750 low light, cooled CCD color video. Images were captured on a Macintosh computer and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. For flow cytometry, fibroblasts were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes to mid-log phase (∼2 days) and then processed by a modification of the procedure of Bauer and Jacobberger (40Bauer K.D. Jacobberger J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 351-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were trypsinized, counted in a Coulter counter, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 0.5% paraformaldehyde to a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. One-ml aliquots were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was removed, and 1 ml of cold 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBA (0.1% sodium azide and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) was added. After 5 min on ice the samples were centrifuged as above, the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of primary antibody diluted in PBA. After 1 h on ice, the cells were washed once with PBA, resuspended in 200 μl of secondary antibody diluted in PBA, and incubated on ice in the dark for 1 h. After washing once with PBA, the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 0.08 Kunitz units/ml RNase A (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, after which 500 μl of 100 μg/ml propidium iodide was added. The cells were stored at 4 °C and filtered through a 70-μm filter immediately before use. Flow cytometry analysis was on a Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL-MCL flow cytometer at the Flow Cytometry Facility of the Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, CA. Figures were generated using FlowJo 3.4 from Tree Star, Inc. (San Carlos, CA; www.treestar.com/flowjo). At the times indicated, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the cultures on coverslips to a final concentration of 10 μm, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 20 min. The coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and transferred to 24-well plates. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and then the coverslips were blocked with PBG (0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.2% cold fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (41Neff N.F. Ellis N.A. Ye T.Z. Noonan J. Huang K. Sanz M. Proytcheva M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 150 μl of antibody against p261 diluted in PBG to 2.5 μg/ml was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS, and then 150 μl of Cy3 donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc.) diluted 1:50 in PBG was added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min at room temperature, washed, and blocked with PBG for 30 min. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-PCNA antibody (Sigma, diluted 1:50 in PBG) was added, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and then the DNA was denatured to allow antibody access to the BrdUrd by incubating the coverslips in 2 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing and blocking as above, biotin-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:80 in PBS was added and the plates were left overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS, Cy5-streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:80 in PBG was added, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the coverslips with PBS, the DNA was stained with 0.1 μg/ml DAPI in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and the coverslips were mounted in glycerol, 10× PBS, 9:1, and stored in the dark at 4 °C. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope and captured using the Zeiss 510 software on a Silicon Graphics O2 R12k UNIX work station running Windows NT 4 in the Biological Imaging Facility of the College of Natural Resources at the University of California, Berkeley, CA. Images were analyzed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Cells in S phase, as determined by BrdUrd incorporation, were scored for pol ε/PCNA staining pattern according to three categories, which are neighbors, neighbor plus colocalized, and colocalized. Neighbors were defined as cells with clearly visible and separable pol ε (red) and PCNA (green) foci, although some overlap (yellow color) was allowed at the edge of the foci. Cells that had predominantly yellow but few red and green foci were scored as colocalized. Cells with both patterns were scored as neighbor plus colocalized. For cell cycle experiments, 147 cells initially were scored for 12 time points for an average of 12 cells per time point. This experiment was repeated, and the pattern was confirmed by counting 500 cells over 15 time points over 44 h (two cell cycles) for an average of 33 cells per time point; the latter data for 9 of the time points are shown in Fig. 4 and Table II. The data from different experiments could not be combined because the cells were of different population doublings and therefore entered S phase at different times after release from serum starvation.Table IIDistribution of focus patterns in synchronized cellsTimeTotal cellsNumber of cells with patternNeighborNeighbor/ColocalizedColocalizedh0251 (4%)0010358 (23%)00123412 (35%)00142211 (50%)1 (5%)0162817 (61%)5 (18%)0183921 (54%)8 (21%)1 (3%)202613 (50%)4 (15%)3 (12%)22267 (27%)4 (15%)4 (15%)24407 (18%)3 (8%)4 (10%) Open table in a new tab For the statistical analysis of nearest neighbors, each PCNA or p261 focus of five representative cells with the neighbor pattern was assigned x, ycoordinates on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image. The distance from each p261 focus to each PCNA focus and vice versa was generated using the distance-to-distance matrix feature of CrimeStat 1.1, available at www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/crimestat.html (42Levine N. CrimeStat, Version 1.1. Ned Levine & Associates, Annandale, VA2000Google Scholar). First-order nearest neighbors and mean distances were determined using SAS software, Version 6.12 for the PC (43SAS Institute Statistics, Version 6.12. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC1996Google Scholar). The significance of the neighboring foci association was determined using a paired Student'st test against a random distribution generated with Microsoft Excel 2000. A video of the cells that appear in Fig. 5 is provided in the online supplemental material. The video shows a series of confocal planes that progress from the lower to the uppermost planes. The planes are 0.5-μm thick with no separation or overlap between them. pol ε foci can be seen throughout the cell but particularly in the uppermost planes. To determine the cellular localization of pol ε, normal diploid human fibroblasts were stained with monoclonal antibodies generated against purified HeLa pol ε that recognized p261 and p59 (27Chui G. Characterization of HeLa DNA Polymerase ε. University of California, Berkeley, CA1995Google Scholar). In 91% (41/45) of asynchronous cycling cells, pol ε p261 and p59 staining were localized to the nucleus (Fig.1 A). Nine percent of the cycling cells showed no detectable pol ε staining. By contrast, 14% (33/236) of non-cycling, confluent fibroblasts stained positively for pol ε p261 or p59 (Fig. 1 B). This pol ε staining pattern is similar to the staining pattern of the replicative polymerase, pol α (Fig. 1 (44Nakamura H. Morita T. Masaki S. Yoshida S. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 151: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar)) but differs from that of PCNA, which is both a DNA repair and replication factor (Fig. 1 and Refs. 22Nichols A.F. Sancar A.

Nature. 1987; 326: 515-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1642) Google Scholar). The contrast between log phase and stationary phase cells is consistent with observations that log phase fibroblasts have 2.4-fold more p59 protein than confluent cells, as measured by immunoblotting (data not shown) and that mRNA levels of HeLa p261 are 5-fold higher in extracts from cycling cells than from quiescent cells (46Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 47Tuusa J. Uitto L. Syvaoja J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2178-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, the in vitro polymerase activity of extracts from fibroblasts increases 40% after serum stimulation of starved G0 cells (46Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Comparing cycling and non-cycling cells, parameters for pols α and ε varied similarly, including antigen levels, mRNA levels, enzyme activity (46Chui G. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7799-7808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and immunofluorescence (Fig. 1). Many proteins involved in DNA metabolism have been observed as discrete foci in the nucleus, including PCNA (48Celis J.E. Celis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3262-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and DNA polymerase α (49Hozak P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). To determine whether pol ε localized to such foci, we examined the sub-nuclear localization of pol ε p261 by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM), a technique that allows a single plane of the nucleus to be viewed (50Wright S.J. Centonze V.E. Stricker S.A. DeVries P.J. Paddock S.W. Schatten G. Matsumoto B. Cell Biological Applications of Confocal Microscopy. 38. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 1-45Google Scholar). We chose to focus on p261 because it is the catalytic subunit and would be required to be in sites of pol ε activity. Indeed, in log phase fibroblasts pol ε p261 staining was found in discrete nuclear foci as well as in a diffuse pattern (Fig.2 A). Nuclear foci of PCNA and other proteins present at the replication fork have been observed to colocalize with sites of newly synthesized DNA, as detected by pulse labeling w"

The bacterial homolog of Hsp104 is ClpB, a ubiquitous protein found in various strains of bacteria (5Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalrymple B. Kuramitsu H.

Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

We have demonstrated that heat-inactivated proteins were rescued by the cooperation between DnaK (Hsp70)-DnaJ-GrpE and ClpB from a thermophilic eubacteria, Thermus thermophilus HB8 (9Motohashi K.

Recently, it has been recognized that ATP-dependent remodeling and unfolding of proteins underlie the functions of the members of this family. ClpA, a major member of this family, is involved in ATP-dependent protein degradation through association with the unrelated protease ClpP. Without ClpP, ClpA can disassemble inactive dimers of the plasmid P1 initiator protein, RepA, into active monomers (23Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and unfold SsrA (a signal peptide that is responsible for recruiting truncated proteins to ClpAP for degradation)-tagged protein (24Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proteolysis by the ClpAP complex is based on these activities of ClpA. ClpX and ClpY (HslU) are also known to be regulatory subunits of the ATP-dependent protease and are complexed with the unrelated proteases ClpP and ClpQ (HslV), respectively. Similar to ClpA, ClpX shows protein remodeling and unfolding activity (25Kim Y.I. Burton R.E. Burton B.M. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The Hsp100/Clp family is divided into two major classes. Members of the first class (Class1) have two nucleotide binding domains, NBD1 (N-terminal side) and NBD2 (C-terminal side) in a single polypeptide. Each of the two NBDs contains consensus sequence motifs, WalkerA (GXXGXGKT, where X is the variable) and WalkerB (hhhhDE, where h is the hydrophobic residue) (27Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). Although each of these two domains is well conserved throughout all members of the Class1 Hsp100/Clp family, there is only a limited sequence similarity between NBD1 and NBD2. Members of another class (Class2) have only one NBD homologous to NBD2 of the Class1 Clps. ClpB, Hsp104, and ClpA belong to the Class1, and ClpX and ClpY belong to Class2 (15Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The role of the NBDs in the Hsp100/Clp family has been studied using site-directed mutagenesis in vivo and in vitro(3Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As expected, the replacement of the Lys residue in the NBD of ClpY by Thr resulted in a loss of adenine nucleotide binding, hexamer formation, and ATPase function (31Shin D.H. Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seol J.H. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The distinct roles of the two NBDs have been probed for several Class1 members. For yeast Hsp104, mutations in the NBD2 affected oligomer assembly more severely than the same mutations in NBD1 (16Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schirmer E.C. Queitsch C. Kowal A.S. Parsell D.A. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

Kowal A.S. Lindquist S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the contrary, two independent studies on E. coli ClpA (29Singh S.K.

For E. coli ClpB, mutants of the WalkerA motif in either NBD1 or NBD2 possess significant ATPase activity, but only the former lost the ability of ATP-dependent assembly of a uniform 580-kDa oligomer in the presence of salt (22Kim K.I. Cheong G.W. Park S.C., Ha, J.S. Woo K.M. Choi S.J. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, similar experiments were carried out for ClpB from T. thermophilus(TClpB) by Schlee et al. (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), but the results differed from those of E. coli ClpB. They observed that wild-type TClpB did not assemble into a uniform oligomer with a distinct molecular mass in the presence of ATP and salt, but that rather it existed as a dynamic mixture of various oligomeric states with dimers and tetramers being the dominant species. Mutants ofTClpB in WalkerA motif of either NBD1 or NBD2 were shown to have only little effect on these oligomeric states. All of their measurements were carried out at 25 °C. Here, using TClpB, we report that at 55 °C, a physiological temperature for T. thermophilus,TClpB exists as a stable 580-kDa oligomer in the presence of ATP and salt, and that the mutation of the WalkerA motif in NBD1 but not NBD2 prevents the formation the 580-kDa oligomer. Thus, the previous discrepancy between E. coli ClpB andTClpB on the role of WalkerA motif in NBD1 was resolved. In addition, we clarified that WalkerB motif of each NBD is essential for ATP hydrolysis activity of its own NBD. The recombinant plasmid pMCB1 (9Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) containing a gene for TClpB was used for mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using polymerase chain reaction with the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The proteins were expressed in E. coli (BL21 (DE3)) and purified as described previously (9Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TDnaKJ complex andTGrpE were also expressed in E. coli (BL21 (DE3)) carrying pMKJ8 (TDnaKJ complex) and pMGE3 (TGrpE), respectively, and purified as described previously (36Motohashi K. Yohda M. Endo I. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17343-17348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Motohashi K. Yohda M. Odaka M. Yoshida M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Throughout this paper, concentrations of substrate proteins are expressed as monomers and those of T. thermophiluschaperones are noted as the trigonal complex for TDnaKJ complex (38Motohashi K. Taguchi H. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27074-27079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), dimer for TGrpE. TClpB and its mutants are expressed as a monomer or hexamer as indicated. The fluorescent nucleotide analogous 2′(3′)-O-N′-methylaniloyl-aminoadenosine-5′-diphosphate (Mant-ADP) was prepared as described previously (39Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Hitachi F4500 fluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 360 nm, and emission spectra from 400–500 nm were collected. Purified wild-type or mutant TClpB (1 μm as hexamer) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (1.2 ml) were preincubated for more than 10 min in a sealed stirring cuvette at 55 °C. Mant-ADP was added, and the fluorescence spectra were measured when equilibration was reached (1 min). As a control, the fluorescence spectra of the buffer containing the same components, other than TClpB, with appropriate concentrations of Mant-ADP were measured, and the differences of the emission intensities at 440 nm were plotted against concentrations of Mant-ADP. Apparent dissociation constants of Mant-ADP for TClpB (monomer) were calculated by fitting the titration data to the model of simple 1:1 binding taking into consideration the decrease of concentrations of free Mant-ADP as shown in Equation 1 ΔFl=C×[[E]+[F]+KdEquation 1 −square root{([E]+[F]+Kd)2−4×[E]×[F]}]/2where ΔFl is the change of the fluorescence intensity at 440 nm, C is the constant, E is theTClpB monomer, F is the Mant-ADP, and K d is the apparent dissociation constant of Mant-ADP forTClpB. The displacement of Mant-ADP by ADP or ATP was detected by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence at 440 nm by adding Mg-ADP or Mg-ATP. Dissociation constants of ADP and ATP for TClpB (monomer) were calculated by fitting the titration data to the model of competitive binding as shown in Equation 2 Fl=C1+C2×[[E]×Kd2+[F]×Kd2+Kd1×Kd2+Kd1×Equation 2 [S]−square root{([E]×Kd2+[F]×Kd2+Kd1×Kd2+Kd1 ×[S])2âˆ’4×Kd22×[E]×[F]}]/(2×Kd2where Fl is the fluorescence intensity at 440 nm,C 1 and C 2 are the constants, E is the TClpB monomer, F is the Mant-ADP,K d 1 is the apparent dissociation constant of Mant-ADP for TClpB, S is the ADP or the ATP, andK d2 is the apparent dissociation constant of ADP or ATP for TClpB. Data were analyzed with KaleidaGraph 3.0 (Synergy Software). Purified wild-type or mutantTClpB (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, the indicated concentrations of KCl, and the indicated nucleotide was preincubated for more than 1 min at the loading temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 min (no obvious precipitation). An aliquot (100 μl) of the solution was loaded on a HPLC gel-filtration column TSK G-3000SWXL(Tosoh). The column was preequilibrated, and the protein was eluted at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min with the same buffer as described above but without dithiothreitol at the indicated temperature. The elution of proteins was monitored by absorbance at 290 nm. Molecular size standards used were thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa),TDnaKJ complex from T. thermophilus (330 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), G6PDH from Bacillus stearothermophilus(212 kDa), and aldorase (158 kDa). Elution profiles of the heat stable standard proteins (TDnaKJ complex, G6PDH) at 55 °C were the same as those at 20 °C, ensuring that the column properties were not changed at high temperature. Purified TClpB (10 μg/ml) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mmKCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol was incubated with glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.01%) in the absence or the presence of the indicated nucleotide at the indicated temperature for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 150 μl of 1 m glycine, pH 6.25, to 300 μl of the reaction mixture, and proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%) on ice for 10 min. The precipitates were resuspended in the sample buffer for electrophoresis and adjusted to neutral pH by 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Proteins were analyzed with 3.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate and were visualized with silver staining. ATPase activities were assayed in a reaction mixture (200 μl) in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, indicated concentrations of ATP, and 20 μg of casein when indicated. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP. After incubation of the reaction mixtures at 55 °C for an appropriate period, an aliquot was transferred into 2% perchloric acid, and the released Piwas measured by malachite green method (40Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 41Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH (53 kDa) purchased from Unitika) and α-glucosidase (65 kDa) (purchased from Sigma) from B. stearothermophilus were used as substrate proteins. These substrate proteins (0.2 μm as monomers) were dissolved in 250 μl of the reaction mixture (50 mmMOPS-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 150 or 300 mm KCl as indicated) containing 0.2 μm TDnaKJ complex, 0.1 μm TGrpE, and 3 mm ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 72 °C for 8 min for G6PDH or 73 °C for 10 min for α-glucosidase (inactivation period) and subsequently at 55 °C (reactivation period) with the addition of wild-type or mutant TClpB as indicated. After incubation for 120 min at 55 °C, an aliquot was taken out, and recovered enzymatic activity was assayed as follows. G6PDH activity was assayed at 55 °C with the absorbance at 340 nm in the assay solution (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 40 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNADP+, 3 mm glucose-6-phosphate) (42Okuno H. Nagata K. Nakajima H. J. Appl. Biochem. 1985; 7: 192-201PubMed Google Scholar). α-Glucosidase activity was assayed at 55 °C by absorbance at 405 nm in the assay solution (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 2 mm p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside). We introduced three types of mutation into each of NBDs (Fig. 1). One type was mutations in the WalkerA motifs, a replacement of Lys-Thr by Ala-Ala (KT/AA). The other two were mutations in WalkerB motifs, a replacement of Asp by Asn (D/N) and a replacement of Glu by Gln (E/Q). In addition to these mutations in a single NBD, we made five types of “double” mutants ofTClpB, combining the mutations in NBD1 and in NBD2 as mentioned above. First, we investigated the nucleotide binding ability of the wild-type and mutant TClpB by using the fluorescence nucleotide analog Mant-ADP at 55 °C. When Mant-ADP was mixed with the wild-typeTClpB, fluorescence increased severalfold, and the emission peak was blue-shifted. The extent of the fluorescence increases at 440 nm induced by the wild-type, and some of the mutant TClpBs were plotted against the concentrations of Mant-ADP (Fig.2, A and B), and the apparent K d values were calculated by fitting the data to a simple 1:1 binding scheme (TableI). A K d value of the wild-type TClpB is estimated to be 1.5 μm. A double mutant carrying mutations in both WalkerA-NBD1 and WalkerA-NBD2 (1KT/AA-2KT/AA) lost the binding ability completely (Fig. 2 A, inset). A single mutant carrying mutations in WalkerA-NBD1 (1KT/AA) showed almost the same fluorescence increase as the wild type, and the K d value was slightly smaller than that of the wild type. A single mutant carrying mutations in WalkerA-NBD2 (2KT/AA) showed only small fluorescence increase. However, the titration curve obeyed a saturation curve, and the K d value (14 μm) was calculated from these data (Fig. 2 A, inset). We also measured the decreases of Mant-ADP fluorescence by adding Mg-ADP or Mg-ATP in the presence of wild-type or mutant TClpB (Fig.3). The apparent K d values of ADP and ATP were calculated by fitting the data to the model of the competitive binding (Table I). The competitive titration of Mg-ADP against Mant-ADP suggested that the affinities for ADP of the 1KT/AA and 2KT/AA mutations were almost the same each other (Table I). Thus, NBD2 has a stronger affinity for Mant-ADP than NBD1 but has almost the same affinity for ADP as NBD1. These results are consistent with those obtained from measurements at 25 °C reported in a previous paper on TClpB (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although the affinities were slightly lower. In the case of ATP, as TClpB has intrinsic ATPase activity, the apparent K d values calculated from displacement titration might be influenced by the binding of ADP generated by ATP hydrolysis. As the values of apparentK d of ATP for all mutants and wild-typeTClpB were higher than the K d values of ADP for each TClpB, the values represent the lower limit. Among them, 1KT/AA, 2KT/AA mutants, and combined mutants have very low or no ATPase activities (see below), thus the influences of generated ADP on the K d value of ATP for these mutants would be relatively low. The apparent K d values of ATP for NBD2 (1KT/AA) and NBD1 (2KT/AA) were essentially the same. The effect of mutations of WalkerB motifs of both NBDs was also examined. Mutations in WalkerB-NBD1 (1D/N and 1E/Q) did not affect the ADP and ATP binding properties of TClpB. Double mutants of WalkerB-NBD1 and WalkerA-NBD2 (1D/N-2KT/AA and 1E/Q-2KT/AA) did not change significantly the binding affinities of a single WalkerA-NBD2 mutant (2KT/AA), although the K d of ATP for 1D/N-2KT/AA was slightly higher. The mutations of WalkerB-NBD2 (2D/N and 2E/Q), either alone or in combination with WalkerA-NBD1 mutation, resulted in a somewhat stronger binding affinity for ADP. Thus, the mutations of WalkerB of both NBDs did not impair or even strengthen the binding of ADP and ATP.Table IDissociation constants of nucleotides for TClpBTClpBK d for Mant-ADPK d for ADPK d for ATPμmμmμmWild type1.511391-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.1KT/AA0.56.1451-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.1D/N1.310551-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.1E/Q1.711371-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.2KT/AA14131101-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.2D/N0.20.9171-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.2E/Q0.53.1171-aThe values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB.1D/N-2KT/AA22153701E/Q-2KT/AA105.9671KT/AA-2D/N0.10.7251KT/AA-2E/Q0.11.1141KT/AA-2KT/AANDNDNDND, not determined (no fluorescence change was observed).1-a The values may only represent a lower limit because of intrinsic ATPase activity ofTClpB. Open table in a new tab Figure 3Displacement titration of Mg-ADP against Mant-ADP to the TClpB. Three typical displacement titrations of Mg-ADP against Mant-ADP are shown. The extent of the fluorescence increase attributed to the remaining Mant-ADP onTClpB were plotted against the Mg-ADP concentration. The initial concentrations of Mant-ADP were 13.2 μm in the cases of wild type and 1KT/AA or 30.8 μm in the case of 2KT/AA. Other conditions were the same as those indicated in Fig.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ND, not determined (no fluorescence change was observed). We measured the ATPase activities of mutants ofTClpB with or without 0.1 mg/ml casein at 55 °C at 5 mm ATP (Fig. 4, Aand B). ATPase activities of all the single mutants with the exception of 1E/Q were lower than that of the wild type but were stimulated by casein, although the degrees of stimulation were different from each other. Unlike other mutations, 1E/Q mutation had an enormously increased ATPase activity, 10-fold that of the wild type, and this activity was not stimulated but rather was slightly inhibited by casein. The real reason of this high casein-insensitive ATPase of the 1E/Q mutant is not known, but one speculative possibility is that residue Glu-271 in the wild-type TClpB may be committed to the suppression of ATP hydrolysis, which can be released by unfolded protein. Both WalkerA-NBD1 (1KT/AA) and WalkerA-NBD2 (2KT/AA) mutants retained some small ATPase activities, which were stimulated when casein was present. Because the 1KT/AA mutant is unable to bind nucleotide at NBD1, the residual ATPase activity of this mutant is solely attributed to the ATPase activity of intact NBD2. Similarly, ATPase activity of 2KT/AA is solely attributed to intact NBD1. The sum of the ATPase activities of the two mutants is far smaller than the activity of the wild type. Thus, each of NBD1 and NBD2 has a basic ATPase activity represented by 2KT/AA and 1KT/AA, respectively, and cooperative stimulation is assumed between two NBDs in the wild-typeTClpB (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To understand the roles of the WalkerB motifs of each of NBDs in the basic ATPase activity, we measured ATPase activities of the double mutants, WalkerA-NBD1/WalkerB-NBD2 (1KT/AA-2D/N and 1KT/AA-2E/Q) and WalkerA-NBD2/WalkerB-NBD1 (2KT/AA-1D/N and 2KT/AA-1E/Q) (Fig. 4 B). No significant ATPase activity was detected for any of the mutants with or without casein. These results indicate that the two acidic residues, Asp-Glu in WalkerB motifs, play a critical role in the ATP hydrolysis reaction occurring in each of NBDs. It has been reported that the yeast Hsp104 andE. coli ClpB oligomerize to a uniform-defined oligomer in an ATP-dependent manner (16Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R.

Biol. 2000; 303: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This defined oligomer of ClpB has been proposed to be a heptamer rather than a hexamer (22Kim K.I. Cheong G.W. Park S.C., Ha, J.S. Woo K.M. Choi S.J. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but we refer to them as a 580-kDa oligomer in this study. At first, oligomer formation of wild-type TClpB was assessed by gel-filtration HPLC (Fig. 5 A,upper trace). At 20 °C in the absence of nucleotide, theTClpB peak appeared with an apparent size of 400–450 kDa (4–5-mer of a 96-kDa monomer). When 2 mm ADP was present in the elution buffer for chromatography, the retention time ofTClpB was significantly delayed, and the estimated molecular size of the dominant species was ∼250 kDa (2–3-mer). In the presence of 2 mm ATP, TClpB eluted at the position of ∼5-mer. However, under any conditions tested at 20 °C,TClpB was eluted as a broad band with a long tail. This finding was not because of interaction with the column matrix as the analysis using another type of gel (Superose 6) gave very similar elution profiles as those described above (data not shown). These results agree with those reported by Schlee et al. (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), who measured the oligomeric state of TClpB at 25 °C. Gel filtration chromatography at 55 °C at which temperatureTClpB is active as a chaperone (9Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12388-12392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) produced different elution profiles (Fig. 5 A, middle trace). With 2 mm ATP present in the elution buffer, TClpB was eluted as a nearly symmetric peak at 12.5 min, which corresponded to an apparent molecular size of 580 kDa (6-mer). Without nucleotide,TClpB eluted as a long-tailed low peak at the position of ∼580 kDa, suggesting the decay of the oligomers during elution. With 2 mm ADP, the peak of TClpB appeared at 13.0 min corresponding to 500 kDa (∼5-mer). In the presence of ADP, E. coli ClpB tends to exist as dimer (19Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and Hsp104 exists as hexamer (16Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present case is different from both cases. The buffers used in the above experiments contained 150 mm KCl. It was reported that the oligomer of TClpB is destabilized when KCl concentration is increased (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In fact, at a higher KCl concentration (300 mm), the elution of TClpB without nucleotide was significantly delayed (Fig. 5 A,lower trace). However, the effect of elevated KCl concentration was minimal on the elution of TClpB in the presence of ATP. Thus, the oligomeric states of TClpB vary depending on the temperature, salt concentration, and the nucleotide present, and it exists as a stable oligomer withM r = 580 kDa at only 55 °C and in the presence of ATP, the same conditions where TClpB is active as a chaperone. This finding was further supported by the cross-linking experiments. TClpB was covalently cross-linked by incubation with glutaraldehyde at 55 °C. In the absence of nucleotide, the product was comprised of molecular species of various sizes as shown by a ladder pattern on SDS gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5 B,lane 2). In the presence of 3 mm ATP, the cross-linked product was electrophoresed as a single band corresponding to the sixth band of the ladder pattern of lane 2 (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). Although this observation suggests thatTClpB exist as hexamer in the presence of ATP, the heptameric ring structure of E. coli ClpB was observed with electron microscopy previously (22Kim K.I. Cheong G.W. Park S.C., Ha, J.S. Woo K.M. Choi S.J. Chung C.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the number of monomers in the ring has been remained unsettled. With other conditions such as 3 mm ADP at 55 °C or 3 mm ATP at 20 °C, the cross-linked products showed a ladder pattern on SDS gel electrophoresis similar to that of lane 2 (data not shown). The oligomer states of TClpB mutants were analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography at 55 °C in the presence of 150 mm KCl (Fig.6). Without nucleotide, TClpB mutants were eluted as a broad peak with a long tail (Fig. 6,left panel) as seen for the wild type. When the elution buffer contained 2 mm ADP, the elution of the WalkerA-NBD1 mutant was much delayed, whereas all other single mutants eluted at 13.0 min (∼5-mer) as did the wild type (Fig. 6, center panel). When the elution buffer contained 2 mm ATP, the WalkerA-NBD1 mutant eluted at 13.0 min with a considerable tailing (Fig. 6, right panel). When the KCl concentration was elevated to 300 mm in the presence of 2 mm ATP, elution was further delayed. On the other hand, elution patterns of other mutants in the presence of 2 mm ATP, either at 150 or 300 mm KCl, were very similar to those of the wild type, a nearly symmetric peak at 12.5 min, the position of the 580 kDa oligomer (Fig. 6, right panel). Because the mutants of WalkerB-NBD1 cannot catalyze ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 as described earlier but still can form a stable 580-kDa oligomer, ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 is not essential for the assembly to form a 580-kDa oligomer. The results of mutations of NBD2 indicate that ATP binding and hydrolysis at NBD2 are not prerequisite for the assembly. To summarize, the ATP binding to NBD1 but not hydrolysis, is necessary and sufficient for the assembly of a stable 580-kDa oligomer of TClpB. We previously demonstrated chaperone activity of TClpB in the reactivation of the heat-inactivated proteins. Cooperation with theTDnaKJ-GrpE set was essential for this activity (9Motohashi K. Watanabe Y. Yohda M. Yoshida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7184-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Watanabe Y.H. Motohashi K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12388-12392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using α-glucosidase and G6PDH as substrate proteins, chaperone activities of TClpB mutants were measured. Substrate proteins were inactivated at high temperatures (73 °C for α-glucosidase and 72 °C for G6PDH) in the presence ofTDnaKJ complex +TGrpE + 3 mm ATP, and then the temperature was shifted down to 55 °C with concomitant addition of TClpB. When the wild-type TClpB was added, ∼70% activities were recovered after a 2-h incubation for both α-glucosidase and G6PDH. When the WalkerB mutants of either of the NBDs were added instead of the wild type, the substrate proteins were reactivated, although the yield was somewhat diminished (Fig.7, A and B). Conversely, when the WalkerA mutants of either of the NBDs were added, no reactivation was observed. We examined several other experimental conditions such as the addition of TClpB prior to incubation at 72 °C, a 5-fold excess of TClpB, or 300 mmKCl, but the results were essentially similar, although the reactivation yield at 300 mm KCl was slightly lower (data not shown). These results indicate that ATP binding to both NBDs is required for chaperone activity. ATP hydrolysis at only one of the NBDs can support some small chaperone activity, but efficient activity requires communication between two intact NBDs. The functional role of each of the two NBDs of ClpB/Hsp104 family has been contradictory in the previous papers. WalkerA motif in NBD2 (yeast Hsp104) or the WalkerA motif in NBD1 (E. coli ClpB) or none of them (TClpB) has been implicated in playing an essential role in oligomerization (16Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4480-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kim K.I. Cheong G.W. Park S.C., Ha, J.S. Woo K.M. Choi S.J. Chung C.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A part of this discrepancy is now resolved by this work, as TClpB behaves similarly to E. coli ClpB when experiments are carried out at 55 °C rather than at 25 °C (34Schlee S. Groemping Y. Herde P. Seidel R. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) where the oligomers are unstable. Thus, ATP binding to NBD1 is necessary for ClpB to form a stable oligomer. In addition, the result of WalkerB mutants in NBD1 ofTClpB provides good evidence that ATP binding alone but not ATP hydrolysis at NBD1 enables TClpB to form stable 580-kDa oligomers. This report has also clarified the role of the WalkerB motifs of TClpB for the first time in the Hsp100/Clp family. The WalkerB motifs of this family have always hhhhDE sequence (where h is the hydrophobic residue). Substitution of the carboxylate group of Asp or Glu with carboxyamide group (Asn or Gln) abolishes the basic ATPase activity of each of the NBDs. Therefore, both Asp and Glu in the WalkerB motif are necessary for ATP hydrolysis. Considering the crystal structure of HslU, a member of Hsp100/Clp family (21Sousa M.C. Trame C.B. Tsuruta H. Wilbanks S.M. Reddy V.S. McKay D.B. Cell. 2000; 103: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), one can assume that Asp is ligated to Mg2+, and Glu is acting as a water-attacking base. Some different effects of mutations between D/N and E/Q substitutions of the WalkerB motif of the same NBD, such as ATPase activities of 1D/N and 1E/Q mutants, may be caused by such a difference. We thank J. Suzuki for technical assistance of DNA sequencing, Drs. T. Hiratsuka for providing us with Mant-ADP, J. Hardy for critical reading of the manuscript, and Y. Kato-Yamada for the helpful discussions."

Studies using lxr null mice have shown that LXRα is essential for normal cholesterol homeostasis and secretion of excess cholesterol in vivo (9Peet D.J. Turley S.D., Ma, W.

Cell. 1998; 93: 693-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar).Recent work has shown that LXRα plays a fundamental role in macrophage biology by regulating cholesterol efflux from lipid-loaded cells. This is manifested by LXRα-mediated induction of genes encoding the ATP-binding cassette proteins ABC-1 and ABCG1, which encode plasma membrane-associated reverse cholesterol transport proteins that mediate cholesteryl ester and free cholesterol efflux from monocytes and lipid-loaded macrophages (12Costet P.

Effluxed cholesterol is subsequently delivered to extracellular acceptors, especially high density lipoprotein/ApoE, and transported back to the liver where it is converted to bile acids and excreted (1Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The key role of LXR as a master regulator in the overall process governing cholesterol efflux and reducing intracellular cholesterol levels is underscored by the findings that the genes encoding ApoE, which is necessary for high density lipoprotein formation is also a transcriptional target of LXR (16Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kast H.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The pivotal role of LXRα in regulating reverse cholesterol transport in macrophages is of particular disease relevance, because lipid accumulation in these cells, through the uptake of oxLDL, is of fundamental importance to the etiology and pathogenesis of atherogenesis and atherosclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. oxLDL particles accumulate in macrophages that have infiltrated the arterial intimal space, subsequently developing into lipid-loaded foam cells that comprise the characteristic fatty streak of early atherosclerotic lesions (17Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). In this context, LXRα, by reducing intracellular cholesterol and lipid accumulation, is considered to be anti-atherogenic. Consistent with this, recent studies have shown that selective agonists of RXR, which activate LXR/RXR heterodimers, significantly reduce lesion size and the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE−/− animals (18Claudel T. Leibowitz M.D. Fievet C. Tailleux A. Wagner B. Repa J.J. Torpier G. Lobaccaro J.M. Paterniti J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).Exposure of monocytes and other cell types to oxLDL and some of its constituent oxysterols and oxidized lipids exert pleiotropic effects on gene expression and elicit numerous cellular changes that are associated with normal cell function and molecular processes linked to pathological states (17Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). These include alteration in the expression of genes that are not necessarily involved in regulating cellular lipid content and homeostasis. For instance, studies have shown that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and platelet-derived growth factor are differentially modulated in macrophages in response to oxLDL or various oxysterols (19Hamilton T.A., Ma, G.P.

Similarly, other studies have demonstrated diverse effects of oxLDL and oxysterols in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells (23Jovinge S. Crisby M. Thyberg J. Nilsson J. Arterioscler.

The cytokines described above provoke local inflammatory responses and can induce apoptosis of macrophages resident within the arterial intimal space and smooth muscle cells in the medial layer of the arterial wall (17Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). They can also promote T-cell infiltration and tissue necrosis that contribute to the late stage necrotic core within complex atherosclerotic lesions (26Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar).Although oxLDL provides ligands for LXRα, and macrophages may generate endogenous oxysterols that can activate LXRα (6Brown A.J. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 320-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a role for LXR and LXR agonists in cytokine production in monocytes/macrophages has not been described. Here, we demonstrate that administration of the LXR-specific ligand 22(R)-HC to peripheral blood-derived human monocytes and to monocytic THP-1 cells, in the presence of 9cRA, results in the specific and selective production of bioactive TNF-α, a key pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic cytokine. We further show that TNF-α production occurs via a novel two-step process that involves an initial oxysterol-dependent induction of TNF-α mRNA and intracellular protein accumulation mediated by LXRα/RXRα binding to an LXRE in the TNF-α promoter, and subsequent cell release of TNF-α protein via a separable 9cRA-dependent, LXR-independent step, which requires de novo transcription and protein synthesis. These observations establish a novel role for LXR and oxysterols in monocyte function and identify a unique pathway of cytokine production in these cells.DISCUSSIONThe emergent role of LXRα in interconnected pathways that control rates of lipid accumulation and efflux and in coordinating cellular responses to lipid-loading in monocytes and macrophages, and its linkage to pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis has placed this transcription factor under intense scrutiny (18Claudel T. Leibowitz M.D. Fievet C. Tailleux A. Wagner B. Repa J.J. Torpier G. Lobaccaro J.M. Paterniti J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). The findings reported here identify a new and potentially significant role for LXRα and oxysterols in monocytes and macrophages by demonstrating that LXRα and its oxysterol ligands specifically stimulate TNF-α mRNA synthesis. Moreover, we show that cell release of TNF-α protein made in response to LXR activation is mediated via an independent and separable mechanism that is stimulated by the retinoid 9cRA but that does not require LXR. Our findings are unusual in that secretion of TNF-α was specific to this cytokine, and the typical co-expression of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 associated with the inflammatory response, and seen in cells exposed to endotoxins such as LPS, was not observed. The foregoing suggests that oxysterol activators of LXR and 9cRA cooperate in a novel and selective pathway of cytokine induction that may be specific to TNF-α.Transfection analysis and inhibitor studies demonstrated that the TNF-α promoter is a direct target for transactivation by LXR/RXR heterodimers. This manifests principally through direct binding of LXRα/RXRα to a bona fide LXRE present at position −879 of the TNF-α promoter. In addition to this LXRE, there appear to be other downstream regions of the promoter that are required for full LXR responsiveness. Thus, a promoter derivative that was missing the upstream LXRE (pTNF(Δ971–762)) was still activated by LXR/RXR, albeit to a much lesser degree than derivatives that retained the identified LXRE. This suggests that full activity requires the presence of a second response element and/or cooperativity with other transcription factors. Ongoing studies to further delineate LXRα protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions, and interplay with other transcription factors will provide insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional activation and potential convergence with other signaling pathways that are known to be important for TNF-α gene expression.TNF-α plays a predominant and pleiotropic role in inflammation and host defense and, if left unregulated, can cause chronic inflammation and septic shock. Consequently, production of bioactive TNF-α is stringently regulated by multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms that serve to modulate expression, abundance, modification, processing, stability, subcellular localization, and secretion of TNF-α mRNA and/or protein (35Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 36Dean J.L. Wait R.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Our findings identify a novel post-translational pathway of control that is stimulated by 9cRA. Inhibitor studies and order-of-addition experiments indicated that 9cRA acts as a step subsequent to 22(R)-HC/LXR-mediated induction of TNF-α mRNA and protein synthesis. This post-translational step is independent of LXR, because 9cRA-mediated TNF-α release was not ablated in the presence of the LXR antagonist 22(S)-HC. This step, however, requires de novo transcription and protein synthesis because it was sensitive to inhibition by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively. The foregoing suggests that 9cRA, potentially through activation of endogenous RXR, stimulates the synthesis of one or more cellular factors required for cellular release of mature TNF-α protein. Although there is no precedent for such a mechanism in macrophages, a previous report suggests that 9cRA and RXR can promote the secretion of insulin from glucose-stimulated pancreatic islet cells (40Chertow B.S. Driscoll H.K. Goking N.Q. Primerano D. Cordle M.B. Matthews K.A. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 656-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been reported that biologically active, mature TNF-α in activated macrophages is retained in the Golgi complex and is subsequently translocated from this intracellular pool by various stimulants (39Shurety W. Merino-Trigo A. Brown D. Hume D.A. Stow J.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), perhaps mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades (41Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K. Lin J.H. Patriotis C. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Kollias G. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to unravel the mechanisms and pathways involved in 9cRA-mediated release of TNF-α and whether this process is specific to TNF-α made in response to 22(R)-HC/LXR and involves other nuclear hormone receptors such as RXR.The penetration of monocytes into the vascular intima and their differentiation into lipid-loaded foam cells through influx of oxLDL by scavenger receptors such as CD36 and SR-A is one of the earliest steps in atherogenesis (17Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar, 42van Reyk D.M. Jessup W. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 66: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this context, LXRα, by promoting reverse cholesterol transport through stimulation of ABC-1 and ApoE1 expression, is considered to be anti-atherogenic. Recent findings that LXR and RXR agonists reduce lesion size and the progression of atherosclerosis in apoE−/− animals (18Claudel T. Leibowitz M.D. Fievet C. Tailleux A. Wagner B. Repa J.J. Torpier G. Lobaccaro J.M. Paterniti J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Heyman R.A. Auwerx J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2610-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) are consistent with this view. In contrast, co-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, are considered pro-atherogenic, because these agents can promote inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis in atheromatic lesions, leading to late-stage lesion calcification and clinical syndrome (17Lusis A.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4608) Google Scholar). Indeed, several reports have shown that certain oxysterols induce apoptosis (43Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) and that atherosclerotic lesions contain significant numbers of apoptotic cells as well as immunoreactive TNF-α (44Crisby M. Kallin B. Thyberg J. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Kostulas V. Nilsson J. Atherosclerosis. 1997; 130: 17-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 45Niemann-Jonsson A.

However, the selective expression of TNF-α by oxysterols/LXR in the absence of the other primary cytokines normally associated with inflammation suggests that LXR activation does not elicit a generalized pro-inflammatory response. In this context, specific oxysterol/LXR-dependent stimulation of TNF-α expression in monocytes/macrophages resident within the intima, coupled with LXR-mediated cholesterol efflux, could lead to diminishment of lesion size by inducing apoptosis of proliferating smooth muscle cells, foam cells, and/or infiltrating T cells. However, a deleterious effect of TNF-α expression cannot be excluded a priori, because TNF-α could also serve to worsen the existing state by stimulating inflammatory cytokine production from infiltrating T cells. TNF-α elicits pleiotropic and complex pathophysiological effects, and the biological relevance of our findings may bear on diverse cellular functions and physiological circumstances that are unrelated to any of the scenarios discussed above. In this context, it is noteworthy that any pathophysiological consequences of oxysterol-mediated TNF-α induction from monocytes/macrophages would presumably be evident only under specific physiological circumstances where a second signal, mediated by compounds such as 9cRA, is available to stimulate cell release of TNF-α.In summary, we demonstrate that the human TNF-α gene is a direct target for LXRα transactivation in monocytes and identify a unique and multistep pathway of TNF-α production in these cells. Our findings reveal a potentially important new dimension to the physiological role of LXRα. Further investigations will help to elucidate the biological consequence of these findings to normal cellular function and pathological states.

https://openalex.org/W2051947475,"The interaction between model lipid membranes and the binding component (Ib) of the ADP-ribosylating iota-toxin of<i>Clostridium perfringens</i> was studied in detail. Ib had to be activated by trypsin to result in channel formation in artificial lipid bilayers. The channels formed readily by Ib had a small single-channel conductance of about 85 picosiemens in 1 m KCl. Channel function was blocked in single-channel and multichannel experiments by the enzymatic component Ia in a pH-dependent manner. The strong Ia-mediated channel block of Ib occurred only when the pH was at least lowered to pH 5.6. The single-channel conductance showed a linear dependence on the bulk aqueous KCl concentration, which indicated that the channel properties were more general than specific. Zero current membrane potential measurements suggested the Ib channel has an ∼6-fold higher permeability for potassium ions than for chloride. The selectivity ratio changed for salts composed of cations and anions of different mobility in the aqueous phase, again suggesting that Ib formed a water-filled general diffusion pore. Asymmetric addition of activated Ib to lipid bilayer membranes resulted in an asymmetric voltage dependence, indicating its full orientation within the membrane. Titration experiments with chloroquine and different tetraalkylammonium ions suggested that the Ib channel was blocked by these compounds but had only a weak affinity to them. <i>In vivo</i> measurements using Vero cells demonstrate that chloroquine and related molecules also did not efficiently block intoxication of the cells by iota-toxin. The possible role of Ib in the translocation of iota-toxin across the target cell membrane is discussed."

S-layers have evolved as a consequence of the direct interaction of these cells with different habitats and changing ecological conditions, presumably providing them with a selection advantage (3Sleytr U.B. Messner P. Pum D. Sára M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1034-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the past, most efforts on the genetic characterization of S-layers were focused on cloning and sequencing of the corresponding structural genes (for review see Ref. 4Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Up to now, more than 40 different S-layer genes have been characterized, including, so far, only seven genes of glycosylated S-layer proteins. Five of them are of archaeal origin; these are the genes encoding the cell surface glycoproteins ofHalobacterium halobium (GenBankTM protein data base accession number P08198), Haloferax volcanii(P25062), Methanothermus fervidus (P27373),Methanothermus sociabilis (P27374), and Haloarcula japonica (BAB39352). The two remaining genes code for the S-layer protein structural genes of the S-layer glycoproteins from the eubacteria Thermoanaerobacter kivui (P22258) and a mutant strain of Geobacillus stearothermophilus (formerlyBacillus stearothermophilus (5Nazina T.N. Tourova T.P. Poltaraus A.B. Novikova E.V. Grigoryan A.A. Ivanova A.E. Lysenko A.M. Petrunyaka V.V. Osipov G.A. Belyaev S.S. Ivanov M.V. Int. J. Syst. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar)) ATCC 12980 (AAF34763). For these strains, however, no S-layer glycan structures have been elucidated. Besides the S-layer gene sbsD of G. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 (AF228338), the S-layer genes of two other, non-glycosylated wild-type strains from the newly reclassified species (5Nazina T.N. Tourova T.P. Poltaraus A.B. Novikova E.V. Grigoryan A.A. Ivanova A.E. Lysenko A.M. Petrunyaka V.V. Osipov G.A. Belyaev S.S. Ivanov M.V. Int. J. Syst. Environ.

Gene. 1994; 145: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) and sbsB (X98095 (7Kuen B. Koch A. Asenbauer E. Sára M. Lubitz W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) from G. stearothermophilus PV72, and sbsC fromG. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 (AF055578 (8Jarosch M. Egelseer E.M. Mattanovich D. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. Microbiology. 2000; 145: 273-281Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar)) (for review see Ref. 4Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S-layer expression in G. stearothermophilus PV72 can change in response to growth conditions (9Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7182-7189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sára M. Kuen B. Mayer H.F. Mandl F. Schuster K.C. Sleytr U.B. J.

It was shown that S-layer variation,i.e. expression of sbsA in the wild-type strainG. stearothermophilus PV72/p6 or expression ofsbsB in the variant G. stearothermophilusPV72/p2, observed in response to oxygen limitation in the growth medium, is based on DNA rearrangements between the chromosome and a naturally occurring megaplasmid (12Scholz H. Riedmann E. Witte A. Lubitz W. Kuen B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1672-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under elevated temperatures (67 °C), sbsA transcription is blocked by an insertion element, resulting in an S-layer-deficient mutant (10Sára M. Kuen B. Mayer H.F. Mandl F. Schuster K.C. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2108-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Scholz H. Hummel S. Witte A. Lubitz W. Kuen B. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, interruption of the S-layer gene by an insertion element leading to an S-layer-deficient variant has also been reported for sbsC ofG. stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 (14Egelseer E.M. Idris R. Jarosch M. Danhorn T. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2175-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Investigation of the glycosylated S-layer of the wild-type strainG. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a started in the early 1980s and was one of the first detailed studies on a eubacterial S-layer glycoprotein (15Küpcü Z. März L. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). After proteolytic digestion of the isolated S-layer glycoprotein (16Messner P. Hollaus F. Sleytr U.B. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1984; 34: 202-210Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Messner P. Pum D. Sleytr U.B. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 97: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), glycopeptides bearing rhamnose homopolymers consisting of trisaccharide repeating units were isolated (18Christian R. Schulz G. Unger F.M. Küpcü Z. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 150: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Attempts to determine the linkage of the glycan chains to the S-layer polypeptide led to the proposal of an N-glycosidic linkage between rhamnose and asparagine (19Messner P. Sleytr U.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A similar type of linkage was also proposed for the S-layer glycoprotein of the methanogenic archaeon Methanothrix sochngenii (20Pellerin P. Fournet B. Debeire P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1990; 36: 631-636Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this contribution we describe the detailed re-examination of the glycosylation pattern of G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a, including the complete elucidation of the S-layer glycan primary structure and the description of the glycosidic linkage to the S-layer protein. Furthermore, we report on the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene for the S-layer protein, which, following the alphabetical designation of S-layer genes from G. stearothermophilus (for review see Ref. 4Sára M. Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), we designatesgsE. Based on the sequence data, the locations of the S-layer glycan chains on the mature glycoprotein were determined. The detailed knowledge of S-layer glycoprotein glycosylation at the molecular level, in combination with the description of the S-layer protein structural gene and the positions of glycosylation on the mature glycoprotein, constitutes the foundations for a future generation of tailor-made S-layer neoglycoconjugates (for review see Ref. 2Schäffer C. Messner P. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a (5Nazina T.N. Tourova T.P. Poltaraus A.B. Novikova E.V. Grigoryan A.A.

Cells were separated from culture broth by continuous centrifugation (Sepatech 17 RS centrifuge, Heraeus, Vienna, Austria) at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. The biomass was stored at −20 °C. Electron microscopy of freeze-etched preparations of bacterial cells was performed according to published procedures (15Küpcü Z. März L. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out according to a previous study (21Altman E. Schäffer C. Brisson J.-R. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide analysis by HPAEC/PAD on a Carbo-Pac PA-1 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) and amino acid analysis on a Biotronik LC 3000 amino acid analyzer (Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) were performed according to published procedures (22Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In column effluents, carbohydrates were estimated using the thymol reagents (23Adachi S. J. Chromatogr. 1965; 17: 295-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the rhamnose content was determined colorimetrically (24Dische Z. Shettles L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 595-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Terminal sequencing (Edman degradation) of glycopeptides followed standard protocols (25Bock K. Schuster-Kolbe J. Altman E. Allmaier G. Stahl B. Christian R. Sleytr U.B. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7137-7144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For deglycosylation of S-layer glycopeptides with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, the method described by Edgeet al. (26Edge A.B.S. Faltynek C.R. Hof L. Reichert L.E., Jr. Weber P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) was used. Deglycosylation of S-layer glycoprotein followed essentially the same procedure, except the deglycosylated material was resuspended into 5 mguanidinium hydrochloride (1.5 mg/ml) and extracted for 15 min at 25 °C. The extract was dialyzed at 4 °C, once against 10 mm CaCl2, three times against distilled water, and lyophilized. Smith degradation of S-layer glycopeptides was essentially performed as published previously (27Altman E. Brisson J.-R. Messner P. Sleytr U.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), except hydrolysis of the acid-labile polyrhamnan chain was effected with 1 m trifluoroacetic acid for 4 h at 25 °C. Reaction products were recovered after chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (1.0 × 120 cm, Bio-Rad) with 0.1 mm NaCl as eluent. Preparation of chromosomal DNA fromG. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a was performed using Genomic Tips 100/G from Qiagen. All restriction enzymes required were purchased from Invitrogen. Endonuclease digestion was done according to the manufacturer's instructions, and digests were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For recovery of DNA fragments from agarose gels, the system of Geneclean III from Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA (Qbiogene) was used. PCR amplifications were carried out using a PCR Sprint thermocycler (Hybaid, Ashford, UK). SgsE oligonucleotide synthesis was done by MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany), SbsC oligonucleotides were kindly provided by Dr. M. Jarosch (Zentrum für Ultrastrukturforschung, Universität für Bodenkultur Wien, Vienna, Austria). The sequences of all oligonucleotides used are listed below in Table I. All amplification reactions were performed in 50-μl reactions usingPwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and conditions were optimized for each primer pair.

Open table in a new tab For PCR amplification of the N-terminal region of sgsE from genomic DNA of G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a, the primer combination sbsC-22/sbsC-23 was used. Based on the sequences of the obtained PCR products, an inverse PCR approach was chosen to amplify unknown downstream and upstream DNA regions (29Hartl D.L. Ochman H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 293-301PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, ∼500 ng of genomic DNA (5 μl) was completely digested withClaI in a reaction volume of 40 μl and purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA fragments were religated with 3 Weiss units of T4 ligase (New England BioLabs) in a 30-μl reaction volume at 16 °C overnight. DNA was precipitated from the heat-inactivated ligation reaction with ethanol as described by Sambrook et al. (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and resuspended into 20 μl of distilled water. PCR amplification of ligated fragments with primer pair sbsC-15/sbsC-21, using 20 μmol of each primer, was carried out in a 50-μl reaction volume containing 2 μl of ligation mixture as template, 20 μmol of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, each, and 1 unit ofPwo polymerase in 1× reaction buffer. Based on the combined sequences of the overlapping PCR products from the direct and the inverse PCR reaction, the primer pair sgsE-1/sgsE-2 was used for filling in sequence gaps. The entire sgsE gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA of G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a using the primer combination sbsC-22/sgsE-3 and double-strand sequenced. To obtain proteolytic cleavage fragments for sequencing purposes, S-layer glycoprotein and deglycosylated material (8 mg, each) were suspended at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml in 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue (30Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated for 2 min at 100 °C. Proteolytic degradation with V8 protease (Sigma) at a concentration of 30 μg/mg of protein was prolonged for 3 h at 37 °C and stopped by addition of 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue, in a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) and incubated for 2 min at 100 °C. The reaction mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE on a gradient gel (7.5–33% and 3–1.5% cross-linking) at a constant current of 50 mA and 10 °C, using the Protean II electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by semidry blotting in a discontinuous buffer system at a constant current of 0.8 mA/cm2 (31Westermeier R. Elektrophorese-Praktikum. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, Germany1990: 189-196Google Scholar) using the Multiphor Novablot apparatus (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein bands were visualized with Coomassie Blue R-250 staining reagent. Bands of interest were excised from the membrane and N-terminally sequenced. The isolation and purification of S-layer glycoprotein essentially followed published methods (32Messner P. Christian R. Neuninger C. Schulz G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2188-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For structural investigations of the S-layer glycoprotein glycan, the protein portion of 1.5 g of S-layer glycoprotein was exhaustively degraded with Pronase E (Sigma Chemical Co.) as described previously (25Bock K. Schuster-Kolbe J. Altman E. Allmaier G. Stahl B. Christian R. Sleytr U.B. Messner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7137-7144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation products were separated on subsequent chromatography columns (1.5 × 120 cm) of Bio-Gel P-4 (Bio-Rad), Dowex 50W-X8 (H+ form, column dimension 1.0 × 5 cm, Bio-Rad), Bio-Gel P-30, and Bio-Gel P-60, all eluted with 0.1 mm NaCl except the cation exchange column, which was eluted with distilled water. For further purification, the appropriate material (45 mg of S-layer glycopeptide mixture) was applied to a chromatofocusing system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), run in a linear PBE74 buffer pH gradient between 8.5 and 6.0 as described previously (33Schäffer C. Dietrich K. Unger B. Scheberl A. Rainey F.A. Kählig H. Messner P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5482-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Individual, desalted glycopeptide pools, designated CF 1 through CF 3, were further purified by semipreparative RP(C18)-HPLC (34Schäffer C. Müller N. Christian R. Graninger M. Wugeditsch T. Scheberl A. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For degradation with papain (Sigma), 250 mg of S-layer glycoprotein was dissolved in 40 ml of 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% SDS, and incubated with 7.5 mg of enzyme (dissolved in 10 ml buffer) at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped after 2 h by heat inactivation of papain. The pool containing the glycopeptide material was separated from peptides by gel permeation chromatography and chromatofocusing as described above. Individual glycopeptide fragments, designated GP 1 through GP 5, were recovered after RP(C18)-HPLC (34Schäffer C. Müller N. Christian R. Graninger M. Wugeditsch T. Scheberl A. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using a modified water/acetonitrile gradient (0–30% in 45 min). MALDI-TOF analysis of 0.8 μl (about 1.8 mg/ml) of glycopeptide samples (pools CF 1–3) was performed using the same volume of matrix solution (2% 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in distilled water containing 30% acetonitrile) according to a procedure described elsewhere (35Kolarich D. Altmann F. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were acquired on a Dynamo mass spectrometer (Thermo BioAnalysis, Santa Fe, NM). The instrument was operated in the negative-ion mode with a dynamic extraction setting of 0.3 and calibrated with insulin (from porcine pancreas). NMR spectra were recorded at 600.13 MHz for 1H and 150.90 MHz for 13C on a Bruker Avance DRX 600 NMR spectrometer using a 5-mm inverse triple-resonance probe (1H, 13C, broad-band) with triple-axis gradient coils. For the structural assignment of the carbohydrate portion, solutions of the glycopeptide pools (6.9 mg of pool CF 1, 5.3 mg of pool CF 2, and 9.3 mg of pool CF 3) in 0.6 ml of D2O were measured at 300 K using gradient selected DQF-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, gradient selected HSQC and HMBC, as well as gradient-selected HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY experiments with parameters given elsewhere (33Schäffer C.

Zayni S. Messner P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the peptide portion, most of the experiments were additionally performed on solutions of the individual CF pools in 0.6 ml of 90% H2O/10% D2O using pulsed-field gradients for coherence selection and solvent suppression as described in a previous study (36Schäffer C. Kählig H. Christian R. Schulz G. Zayni S. Messner P. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1575-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). All processing and analyses were done off-line on Silicon Graphics workstations using the Bruker software XWIN-NMR 2.6 and the program AZARA 2.0 (provided by W. Boucher and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, UK). Glycan chains were released from S-layer glycopeptides under standard β-elimination conditions (37Strecker G. Verbert A. Methods on Glycoconjugates. Harwood Academic Publishers, Chur, Switzerland1995: 47-50Google Scholar). Glycopeptides (1.0 mg/ml) were treated with 0.1 m NaOH, containing 1 m NaBH4, and 5 mCi of NaB[3H]4 (348 mCi/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 40 h at 45 °C. The cooled solution was acidified to pH 6.0 by addition of 50% acetic acid and subjected to gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (1.0 × 120 cm) using 0.1 mm NaCl as eluent. Fractions (1.5 ml) were collected and analyzed for incorporated radioactivity. As demonstrated previously by freeze etching, the cell surface of the aerobic, thermophilic, Gram-positive organism G. stearothermophilusNRS 2004/3a is completely covered with an oblique S-layer lattice (a = 11.6 nm, b = 9.4 nm, γ ∼ 78°) (17Messner P. Pum D. Sleytr U.B. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 97: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The overall degree of glycosylation of the S-layer protein is ∼1.7% (w/w). In SDS-PAGE, the S-layer glycoprotein is separated into four bands with apparent molecular masses of 93, 119, 147, and 170 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1). The three high molecular mass bands give a positive PAS staining reaction. The 119- and the 147-kDa bands show almost equal intensity, both in the protein and carbohydrate staining reaction, whereas the 170-kDa band appears rather weak (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4). Upon chemical deglycosylation of the S-layer glycoprotein, a single 93-kDa band remains visible on the gel; thus, this band represents the non-glycosylated protomeric unit of the S-layer glycoprotein (Fig. 1, lane 3). These findings are consistent with the previous description of the S-layer glycoprotein of this organism (17Messner P. Pum D. Sleytr U.B. J. Ultrastruct. Mol. Struct. Res. 1986; 97: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on the observed conservation of the N termini of the S-layer proteins SbsA and SbsC from G. stearothermophilus strains PV72/p6 and ATCC 12980, respectively (8Jarosch M. Egelseer E.M. Mattanovich D. Sleytr U.B. Sára M. Microbiology. 2000; 145: 273-281Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar), sequence similarity was also expected for the N terminus of SgsE from G. stearothermophilus NRS 2004/3a. Thus, the sgsE gene was isolated using a combination of inverse and direct PCR approaches, starting with primers specific for the N terminus of sbsC (TableI, Fig. 2). Amplification of a 3300-nt product allowed the determination of the entire nucleotide sequence of sgsE. The sequence has been deposited at GenBankTM under the accession numberAF328862. The entire sgsE sequence revealed one ORF extending 2709 nt, predicted to encode a protein of 903 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 96,652 Da. The ORF starts with an ATG at nucleotide position 1, preceded by a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence 11 nt upstream the start codon. 25 nt downstream of the TAA stop codon, a putative ρ-independent transcriptional termination signal was identified. The terminator consists of a palindromic stem loop sequence of 41 nt with a perfect stem of 17 nt.

The tail region of SET, which is rich in acidic residues, is required for the stimulatory effect on Cdk5/p35 nck5a . Cdk5 is distinct from other cyclin-dependent kinases by virtue of its functions in post-mitotic neurons, but not in proliferating cells. Although Cdk5 is ubiquitously expressed, Cdk5-associated kinase activity has been primarily demonstrated in central nervous system neurons. In such neurons, Cdk5 is associated with p35 nck5a or a p35 nck5a isoform (p39 nck5ai) , two Cdk5 activators with restricted expression in central nervous system neurons (1Lew J. Huang Q.Q., Qi, Z.

Tsim K.W., Ip, F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Besides the full-length protein of p35 nck5a, a proteolytic fragment called p25 nck5a exists in central nervous system neurons. The p25 nck5a protein is generated when the N-terminal 98 amino acids are removed from p35 nck5a (1Lew J. Huang Q.Q., Qi, Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In association with p35 nck5a /p25 nck5a and p39 nck5ai, Cdk5 exhibits a variety of functions in neuronal differentiation and neurocytoskeleton dynamics as well as neuronal degeneration and cell death (9Smith D.S.

Despite little homology between p35 nck5a and cyclins at the primary sequence level, it was proposed that p35 nck5a forms a core structure similar to that of cyclins to support Cdk5 enzyme activity (14Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Lim H.-Y. Seow K.T., Li, Q. Kesuma D. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. Biochem.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The minimal region required for Cdk5 binding and activation was localized to a region in the C-terminal half of p35 nck5a as well as in p25 nck5a (16Tang D. Chun A.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Moreover, Cdk5/p35 nck5a shows many distinct regulatory properties. Cdk5 is highly activated upon association with p35 nck5a /p25 nck5a, and the activation process is not regulated by the cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase Cdk7/cyclin H (8Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Tang D. Chun A.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, up-regulation of Cdk5/p35 nck5a activity was observed when Cdk5 was phosphorylated at Tyr-15 by the cellular tyrosine kinase c-Abl in complex with a bridging protein called Cables (18Zukerberg L.R. Patrick G.N. Nikolic M. Humbert S., Wu, C.L. Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Vidal M. Van Etten R.A. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2000; 26: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation of Cdk2 Tyr-15 is inhibitory to Cdk2 activity (19Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1769) Google Scholar). It is believed that these distinct regulatory properties are due to unique features of the Cdk5/p35 nck5a structure. There are a few lines of evidence implying that Cdk5/p35 nck5a is a multifunctional enzyme existing in many protein complexes in cells. It was revealed by a column chromatographic procedure that Cdk5/p35 nck5a exists as a large molecular complex of >670 kDa in brain tissue extracts (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Consistently, a number of proteins have been reported to associate with Cdk5/p35 nck5a with important functional implications, e.g. tau, neurofilaments M and H, amphiphysin-1, the Rac·p21-activated kinase-1 complex, and the β-catenin·N-cadherin complex (21Sobue K.

To learn more about the functional and regulatory properties of Cdk5/p35 nck5a, we have employed a biochemical approach to isolate proteins from brain lysates using the N- and C-terminal fragments derived from p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai . The isolated proteins were identified using highly sensitive mass spectrometry. The nuclear protein SET was found specifically in the precipitates of the N-terminal constructs of p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai . Detailed characterization was carried out on the interaction between SET and p35 nck5a . We demonstrate that SET further enhances the activity of Cdk5/p35 nck5a, but not that of Cdk5/p25 nck5a, through its association with p35 nck5a .

The GST-p25 nck5a (residues 99–307 of p35 nck5a) and GST-p30 nck5ai (residues 115–367 of p39 nck5ai) constructs were reported previously (2Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H.

The p35 nck5a -His expression construct was generated by insertion of a PCR sequence of p35 nck5a into pQE12 (QIAGEN Inc.). The resulting plasmid, pQE12/p35 nck5a, allows expression of p35 nck5a with a C-terminal His tag. p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai were also engineered into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and pCI-neo (Promega) for protein expression in mammalian cells. glutathioneS-transferase dithiothreitol hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid The full-length encoding sequence of human SET was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from MCF12 cells and inserted into pcDNA3.1C, pXJ40-HA, pGEX-2TK, and pQE30. The SET fragments SET-(1–225), SET-(29–118) and SET-(29–94) were cloned into pcDNA3.1C by PCR using the full-length coding sequence of SET as a template. SET-(1–225) was also cloned into pQE30 (QIAGEN Inc.) for protein expression in bacteria. The GST fusion proteins GST-p10 nck5a, GST-p16 nck5a, GST-p25 nck5a, GST-p19 nck5ai, and GST-p30 nck5ai were prepared as described previously (2Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H.

The GST-tagged proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Expression of the His-tagged proteins His-SET, His-SET-(1–225) and p35 nck5a -His in bacteria and purification with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (QIAGEN Inc.) were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The whole isolation procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Rat brains were homogenized in Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, and 3 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin). The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was carefully collected. GSH beads coated with 100 μg of GST, GST-p10 nck5a, GST-p16 nck5a, GST-p25 nck5a, GST-p19 nck5ai, or GST-p30 nck5ai were mixed with the lysate and incubated for 3 h with gentle shaking. The beads were then extensively washed with Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmbenzamidine). After briefly washing the beads with Buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA), the coupled proteins were eluted by incubation with 3 units of thrombin (Sigma) in Buffer C overnight. The beads were then washed twice with the cleavage buffer without thrombin. The washing and eluting solutions were combined, and 3 volumes of cold acetone were added to precipitate the proteins at −20 °C for 2 h. The precipitates were washed with cold 70% methanol and then dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized following colloidal Coomassie Blue staining. Protein bands excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels were destained, reduced, alkylated, and then in-gel digested with trypsin as described by Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were analyzed on a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR, PE Sciex) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Protein identities were revealed by searching sequence data bases with peptide sequence tags generated by tandem mass spectrometry (27Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L.

After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, the GST-tagged proteins were retrieved with GSH-Sepharose by further incubation for 1 h and then centrifugation. The beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, and the bound proteins were subsequently released by boiling with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The released proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected on Western blots. The anti-Cdk5 (C-8) and anti-p35 nck5a (C-19) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody recognizing the hexahistidine tag in fusion proteins was a monoclonal antibody from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation, transfected cells were harvested after 48 h of culturing and lysed in Buffer A. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation and then used for immunoprecipitation with antibodies as indicated and protein A/protein G beads. After extensively washing the beads with Buffer B, the precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. The polyclonal anti-p39 nck5ai antibody was generated against a peptide derived from p39 nck5ai . The anti-HA antibody is a monoclonal antibody. The anti-SET antibodies used were SP-1, SP-2 and SP-3, recognizing SET peptides AQAAKVSKKELNSN, RLNEQASEEILKV, and RSSQTQNKASRKR, respectively (29Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST), the cells were permeabilized with PBST and then blocked in PBST supplemented with 10% goat serum. The cells were sequentially treated with primary and secondary antibodies diluted in the blocking solution. The secondary antibody was Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. The stained cells were visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Nuclei were also isolated using a nucleus isolation kit (Nuclei EZ prep, Sigma) for immunostaining. The isolated nuclei were fixed in cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min at −20 °C. The fixed nuclei were washed with PBS, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and treated with the indicated primary and secondary antibodies. The stained nuclei were dropped onto a slide and then covered with a coverslip. Cultures of murine neocortical neurons (gestational days 15–16) were prepared as previously described (30Cheung N.S. Beart P.M. Pascoe C.J. John C.A. Bernard O. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In brief, cortices were microdissected from the brains and subjected to trypsin digestion and mechanical trituration. The dissociated cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 ×g) and resuspended in neurobasal growth medium containing B27 supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mml-glutamax-I (Invitrogen), and 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded to a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 in six-well plates previously coated with poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml) or coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine/laminin (BD Biosciences). After 24 h in vitro, the culture medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium. The cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Immunocytochemical staining of the cultures for microtubule-associated protein-2 and glial fibrillary acidic protein indicated that >95% of the cells were neurons with minimal contamination by glia (31Cheung N.S.

The primary culture of mouse cortical neurons was washed three times with PBS and then with Buffer D (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 30% sucrose, and Roche Molecular Biochemicals protease inhibitor mixture). After washing, the cells were suspended in Buffer D, and the suspension was kept on ice for 20 min. The cells were then lysed by gentle homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was washed twice with Buffer D and retrieved by centrifugation. The nuclear pellet was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer as the nuclear fraction. After precipitation of the nuclei, the supernatant of the lysate was collected and used as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were then made up to the same volume for Western blot analysis. Preparation of in vitroreconstituted Cdk5/p35 nck5a and Cdk5/p25 nck5a kinases was carried out following the procedure described by Qi et al. (8Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of GST-Cdk5 was incubated with 1 μg of GST-p35 nck5a or GST-p25 nck5a in 30 μl of Buffer E (30 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm MgCl2) at room temperature for 30 min. Cdk5 kinase activity was measured by catalysis of phosphate incorporation into the synthetic peptide HS-(9–18), derived from histone H1 (8Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To assess the SET effect on Cdk5 activity, Cdk5/p35 nck5a or Cdk5/p25 nck5a was incubated with varying amounts of His-SET or His-SET-(1–225) in Buffer E at room temperature for 30 min. The kinase activities of Cdk5/p35 nck5a and Cdk5/p25 nck5a were then determined by phosphorylation of HS-(9–18), and the assay was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. It has been shown that Cdk5/p35 nck5a, but not Cdk5/p25 nck5a, exists as macromolecular complexes in brain extracts, implying that the N-terminal region of 98 amino acids is important for protein binding (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, p10 nck5a, comprising the N-terminal 98 residues of p35 nck5a, and the longer fragment p16 nck5a, comprising the N-terminal fragment of 149 residues before the Cdk5-binding and -activating domain, as well as GST-p25 nck5a were constructed and prepared as GST fusion proteins. Likewise, p19 nck5ai, comprising the N-terminal 184 amino acids of p39 nck5ai, and p30 nck5ai were prepared as the N- and C-terminal fragments of p39 nck5ai, respectively. To isolate proteins binding to p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai, GST and GST-tagged p35 nck5a or p39 nck5ai fragments were utilized in pull-down experiments with rat brain extracts. The binding proteins were specifically eluted by thrombin cleavage to release the p35 nck5a or p39 nck5ai fragments from GST immobilized on the beads. After separation of the eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE, it was observed that a protein band of ∼39 kDa was clearly present in the pull-down experiments with p10 nck5a, p16 nck5a, and p19 nck5ai, but not visible in those with GST, GST-p25 nck5a, and GST-p30 nck5ai (Fig.1 A). To reveal the identity of this protein band, the excised gel bands were subjected to in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. Tandem mass spectrometric data were acquired from three prominent peptide signals. Searches of protein sequence data bases with sequence tags generated from the tandem mass spectrometric data revealed that all three peptides matched the sequences of the α- and β-isoforms of the rat protein SET, indicating that the SET protein was specifically isolated with the N-terminal fragments of p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai (Fig.1 B). The protein-protein interaction between the protein SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a was carried out and characterized using bacterially expressed proteins. SET was expressed in bacteria either with a GST tag or with a hexahistidine tag at its N terminus. In Fig.2 A, His-SET was individually incubated with GST, GST-p10 nck5a, and GST-p25 nck5a . The recombinant GST proteins were then retrieved using GSH affinity beads. The precipitated proteins were analyzed on an immunoblot with an antibody recognizing the His tag to determine whether SET had coprecipitated with the GST-tagged proteins. In Fig. 2 A, SET was present in the precipitated beads of p10 nck5a, but not in those of the other proteins, providing proof of specific and direct interaction between SET and the N-terminal fragment of p35 nck5a . In Fig. 2 B, the binding assay was carried out by incubating GST-SET or control GST with p35 nck5a -His, His-Cdk5, or a mixture of p35 nck5a -His and His-Cdk5. GST and GST-SET were then isolated using GSH beads, and the coprecipitated proteins were examined for the presence of p35 nck5a -His and His-Cdk5 using p35 nck5a - and Cdk5-specific antibodies, respectively. This showed clear binding of SET to full-length p35 nck5a, but no detectable binding to Cdk5 in the absence of p35 nck5a (Fig. 2 B). However, when SET was incubated with the mixture of p35 nck5a -His and His-Cdk5, both p35 nck5a and Cdk5 were found in the precipitate of SET (Fig.2 B). Clearly, these results indicate that SET forms a complex with Cdk5/p35 nck5a through its specific association with the N-terminal region of p35 nck5a . To demonstrate in vivo association of SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a, the protein-protein interaction was probed in a transfected cell system. Cultured COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the construct expressing SET with an N-terminal HA tag in various combinations of the p35 nck5a and Cdk5 plasmids. Protein expression of the introduced clones in COS-7 cells is shown in Western blots of the cell lysates in Fig.3 A (three upper panels). SET was immunoprecipitated by an antibody directed against the HA tag at its N terminus. In the vector control, the anti-HA antibody did not precipitate coexpressed p35 nck5a and Cdk5, indicating no detectable nonspecific reactivity between the anti-HA antibody and these proteins (Fig. 3 A). Because SET does not bind Cdk5 directly and COS-7 cells have no endogenously expressed p35 nck5a and p39 nck5ai, double transfection of SET and Cdk5 followed by their immunoprecipitation did not result in co-immunoprecipitation of Cdk5 (Fig. 3 A). In double transfection of SET and p35 nck5a plasmids as well as in triple transfection of SET, p35 nck5a, and Cdk5 plasmids in COS-7 cells, SET clearly formed complexes with p35 nck5a and Cdk5/p35 nck5a, respectively (Fig. 3 A). These results corroborate the in vitro binding data and indicate the existence of a trimolecular complex of SET, Cdk5, and p35 nck5a in the transfected cells. Similar results were obtained when p35 nck5a was replaced with p39 nck5ai using the COS-7 cell system (Fig. 3 B), indicating association of SET Cdk5/p39 nck5ai through its interaction with p39 nck5ai . According to the SET sequence, it has an acidic tail of ∼50 amino acids. The secondary structure of SET was predicted using a number of computer structural modeling programs. A long α-helical structure comprising residues 29–94 and a few short helical stretches were predicted to be present in SET (Fig. 4 A). Based on the predicted structure, three truncated SET constructs were made for mammalian expression with a His tag at the N terminus (Fig.4 A). The p35 nck5a plasmid was cotransfected with the plasmid expressing full-length SET or its truncated fragments in COS-7 cells. After affinity precipitation of the recombinant SET proteins from the cell lysates using Ni2+-coupled beads, p35 nck5a was detected in the precipitates of both intact SET and the three truncated fragments (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, p35 nck5a was not detected in the control vector lane (Fig.4 B). It appears that the α-helix composed of residues 29–94 of SET is sufficient for the association with p35 nck5a . Given the interaction between p35 nck5a and SET, we investigated thein vivo localization of SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a . In COS-7 cells transfected with both SET and p35 nck5a constructs, the staining of p35 nck5a was observed throughout the cells, with lower intensity in the nucleus than in the cell peripheral and cytosolic regions (Fig. 5 A). In accordance with previous reports (29Adachi Y. Pavlakis G.N. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2258-2262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), SET was primarily visualized in the nuclear region (Fig. 5 A). When the stained images of p35 nck5a and SET were overlaid, an overlapping localization of the two proteins in the nucleus was revealed (Fig.5 A). To provide more precise data on the nuclear localization of SET and p35 nck5a, intact nuclei were isolated from the transfected COS-7 cells for immunostaining of p35 nck5a and HA-tagged SET. In agreement with the observation from the whole cell staining, the co-localization of SET and p35 nck5a was clearly observed in the isolated nuclei (Fig.5 A). Both SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a have been known to exist in neuronal cells (33Compagnone N.A. Zhang P. Vigne J.L. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Their subcellular localizations were examined in cultured primary neurons derived from gestational day 15 mouse cortices by immunocytochemistry. p35 nck5a labeling was observed in the entire cell body and neurites (Fig. 5 B). Like the p35 nck5a -transfected COS cells, p35 nck5a was stained at a lower extent in the nuclear region (Fig. 5 B). SET appeared to localize primarily in the nuclei of the cultured neurons (Fig.5 B). Nuclear co-localization of SET and p35 nck5a was evident in the merged image of these two proteins (Fig. 5 B). On the other hand, the existence of SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a in the nuclei of the cultured neurons was ascertained by subcellular fractionation and Western blotting (Fig. 5 C). In this experiment, lysates of the cultured neurons were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions for Western blotting with antibodies individually recognizing SET, Cdk5, and p35 nck5a . Cdk5 and p35 nck5a displayed similar distribution patterns, with the majority of the proteins stained in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig.5 C). Moreover, Cdk5 and p35 nck5a were readily detected in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5 C). SET was mostly stained in the nuclear fraction and barely detectable in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5 C). These results unambiguously show the coexistence of SET and Cdk5/p35 nck5a in the nuclear compartment of cultured neurons. Cdk5 can be activated by in vitro reconstitution with p25 nck5a or p35 nck5a (8Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Here, we report on a transient interaction between the lipid-dependent protein kinase Cα and vinculin, an early component of these sites, during spreading of HeLa cells on collagen. In vitro binding of protein kinase Cα to vinculin tail was found dependent on free calcium and acidic phospholipids but independent of a functional kinase domain. The interaction was enhanced by conditions that favor the oligomerization of vinculin. Phosphorylation by protein kinase Cα reached 1.5 mol of phosphate/mol of vinculin tail and required the C-terminal hydrophobic hairpin, a putative phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site. Mass spectroscopy of peptides derived from in vitrophosphorylated vinculin tail identified phosphorylation of serines 1033 and 1045. Inhibition of C-terminal phospholipid binding at the vinculin tail by mutagenesis or deletion reduced the rate of phosphorylation to ≤50%. We suggest a possible mechanism whereby phospholipid-regulated conformational changes in vinculin may lead to exposure of a docking site for protein kinase Cα and subsequent phosphorylation of vinculin and/or vinculin interaction partners, thereby affecting the formation of cell adhesion complexes.

Both processes are part of signaling cascades but are not independent of each other and participate in other signaling pathways.

By bringing multiple actin-organizing proteins in close proximity, vinculin may act as an adaptor protein in addition to its structural role in the binding and cross-linking of membrane-apposed actin filaments. The atomic structure of the entire vinculin molecule is still not known, but the overall structure as revealed by electron microscopy shows a tadpole-like molecule whose tail can be folded and attached to the more globular head portion (21Winkler J. Lunsdorf H. Jockusch B.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The vinculin tail, whose atomic structure has been resolved (22Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C.

It contains two interaction sites for acidic phospholipids, one located at the surface of helices H2-H3 (23Johnson R.P. Niggli V. Durrer P. Craig S.W.

In the closed vinculin conformation that is supposed to reflect the cytosolic moiety, binding sites for talin and α-actinin at the vinculin head, for F-actin at the vinculin tail, and for vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and others at the proline-rich hinge between head and tail are not accessible (20Huttelmaier S.

Both PI4,5P2 binding to and phosphorylation of the tail are proposed to alter vinculin conformation and, thus, expose protein ligand-binding sites (15Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin.

All three bind to integrin β-chains, and the latter two are transmembrane proteins that function as integrin co-receptors (41Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F.

Binding partners and substrates of PKC directly involved in the actin organization of cell adhesion complexes, however, are less well defined (43Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although talin, vinculin, and filamin are considered potential PKC in vivo substrates (27Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Turner C.E. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Biol.

In this report, we present evidence for a physical interaction of PKCα with vinculin during cell spreading. The docking of the enzyme depends on the C-terminal lipid-binding site of the vinculin tail, and PI4,5P2 binding capacity correlates with phosphorylation of adjacent serine residues. These results suggest a possible mechanism whereby PI4,5P2-induced conformational changes in vinculin may result in PKCα binding and subsequent phosphorylation of vinculin and/or vinculin interaction partners as required for the formation of cell-matrix adhesion complexes. Constructs used in this study were amplified according to standard PCR protocols, cloned in pCR-blunt (Invitrogen), and verified by DNA sequencing. Bovine PKCα cDNA (a gift of Dr. Peter J. Parker, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) was equipped either with an N-terminal His tag or a birch-profilin epitope tag (BiPro tag (46Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) and cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). An ATP binding-deficient K368M mutant (47Ohno S. Konno Y. Akita Y. Yano A. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6296-6300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Vinculin fragments encoding the tail domain (amino acids 858–1066) were equipped with an N-terminal FLAG tag and cloned into pQE-30 (Qiagen) that contains a His tag. To remove potential phosphorylation sites at Ser-941/Thr-43, Ser-999, Thr-1050/Thr-55, and Thr-1062 single or double alanine mutants of Vt-(858–1066) were generated, as described above. For the analysis of the lipid dependence of the PKC-vinculin interaction, mutants Vt-(R1060Q/K61Q), Vt-(T1062E), and the deletion fragment Vt-(858–1052) were generated. Graphic views of Vt-(879–1061) based on PDB entry 1QRK(22Bakolitsa C. de Pereda J.M. Bagshaw C.R. Critchley D.R. Liddington R.C. Cell. 1999; 99: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were generated using SwissPDB viewer ((48) www.expasy.ch/spdbv) and POVray 3.1 (www.povray.org) on a Linux platform. Protein complexes were obtained from HeLa cells that had been treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) before lysis essentially as described (20Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum were transfected with His- or BiPro-tagged PKCα or vector control. After 24 h, cells were collected, and 3 × 106 cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes for 10–15 min or 16 h before DSP was added. After the addition of DSP, cells were kept in the incubator for another 15 min, excess cross-linker was quenched in 0.2 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% (v:v) Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). Cell debris, collected by a brief centrifugation, was boiled in 20 μl of a 10% SDS solution to extract the maximal amount of cross-linked complexes and spun again. Supernatants of both centrifugation steps were pooled and adjusted with RIPA buffer to reduce SDS concentration below 0.1%. Precipitation was performed either using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for His-tagged PKCα or a monoclonal antibody against the BiPro sequence (4A6 (46Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Rothkegel M. Biotechniques. 1997; 23: 96-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)) for BiPro-tagged PKCα. Endogenous proteins were detected after Western blotting with the antibodies anti-vinculin (hVIN-1) and anti-actin (1A4) (Sigma). PKCα was probed with a monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All recombinant Vt-(858–1052/66) proteins bearing an N-terminal His tag and a FLAG tag in tandem were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain M15. Batch purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Purity of all proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots using a FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by standard methods. Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged Vt proteins (893–1066, 893–985, and 1016–66) (a gift of Dr. Stefan Huttelmaier) were prepared as described in Huttelmaier et al. (49Huttelmaier S. Bubeck P. Rudiger M. Jockusch B.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1136-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Turkey gizzard α-actinin and vinculin were purified according to Feramisco and Burridge (50Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) instead of a DEAE column. Actin (a gift of Dr. Kathrin Schluter) was prepared from acetone powder of rabbit muscle as described in Spudich and Watt (51Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with an additional gel filtration step. His-tagged PKCα, wild type, or ATP− mutant were synthesized as [35S]methionine-labeled protein byin vitro transcription/translation using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). PI4,5P2 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was prepared as described in Huttelmaieret al. (20Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Vinculin, Vt-(858–1066) and α-actinin were incubated without or with a 50-fold molar excess of PI4,5P2for 30 min at 4 °C and immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane (20 pmol of protein/spot) using a dot blotter with circular slots (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The transfer was controlled by Ponceau staining, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in TBST (25 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6). In vitro translated proteins were diluted (1:40–1:80) in TBST containing 20 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The membrane was incubated in this solution for 2 h at room temperature. After intensive washing in TBST, bound proteins were detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of Vt proteins was analyzed in a mixed micelle assay essentially as described (52Marais R.M. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, Vt proteins (100 pmol/reaction) were preincubated in 36 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100) with 45 μm PI4,5P2 for 30 min on ice. Phosphorylation reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 μl at 30 °C using 0.1 mm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500Ci/mmol), 0.63 mmCaCl2, 0.5 μm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (Calbiochem), and 120 μm phosphatidylserine (Sigma) in kinase buffer. Reactions were started by the addition of 80 ng of recombinant PKCα (Panvera, Madison, WI) and stopped at different time points by mixing a sample of 20 μl with 8 μl of SDS-sample buffer and boiling for 5 min at 95 °C. Subsequently, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS-2500) using Aida 2.1 (Advanced Isotope Data Analyzer) analysis software (Fuji; Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Rates of phosphorylation, based on values of phosphate incorporation from four independent experiments, were compared by variance analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measurements, Bonferroni/Dunn) using Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) (p < 0.05). To test maximal incorporation, 25 pmol of substrate protein were phosphorylated for 1 h using 30 ng of PKCα. Bands were excised and counted for Cherenkov radiation to calculate molar phosphate incorporation. Vt-(wild type) or Vt-(858–1052) protein was phosphorylated by PKC for 1 h (see above), lipids were extracted (53Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3141) Google Scholar), and pellets of phosphorylated protein were dissolved in 50 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8. 1 μg of protein was digested by 10–50 ng of Glu-C or Lys-C endopeptidase (sequencing grade) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Mass spectra were obtained with a MALDI-time of flight Reflex II (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). For co-precipitation, analyte and matrix solutions (20 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamonic acid (4CHCA) in 60% acetonitrile) were mixed in equal portions (0.5 μl) on the MALDI target and dried. Spectra were externally calibrated using monoisotopic (M+H)+ ions from two peptide standards. Approximately 200 shots were collected for each mass spectrum. MS/MS of phosphopeptides was performed by nano-electrospray ionization on a Q-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micro Mass, Manchester, UK). The interaction of recombinant proteins, Vt-(wild type), Vt-(R1060Q/K61Q), and Vt-(858–1052), with actin filaments was analyzed in a sedimentation assay. All proteins used were centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 30 min) before to the sedimentation assays to remove protein aggregates. Pre-polymerized actin (3 μm final concentration) was incubated in the absence or presence of recombinant Vt proteins at various molar ratios at 37 °C for 2 h. Samples were subjected to centrifugation at high speed (100.000 ×g, 1 h) or low speed (12.000 × g, 15 min). Pellets and supernatants were analyzed on Coomassie-stained gels. Low shear viscometry was essentially performed as described (54Korneeva N.L. Jockusch B.M. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 351-355PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant Vt proteins (see above) were added to pre-polymerized actin (3 μm final concentration) at various molar ratios. The solution was loaded in glass capillaries and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The viscosity of the samples was determined relative to the time needed for a steel ball to pass the capillary filled only with an F-actin control. Recombinant Vt proteins (see above) were added to pre-polymerized actin (3 μm) at a molar ratio of 0.8 Vt:actin. After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 10% (v/v) tetramethylrhodamine-labeled phalloidin was added from a stock solution (0.1 mg/ml in methanol), and incubation was continued for 1 h. Filaments were analyzed directly via fluorescence microscopy (Axiophot; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images were taken using a cooled CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) and the MetaMorph® software (Visitron, Puchheim, Germany). Binding of the Vt C terminus to PI4,5P2 micelles was tested as described (55Wittenmayer N. Rothkegel M. Jockusch B.M. Schluter K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, Microlon ELISA plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with Vt proteins (50 pmol each), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 2 h with increasing amounts of PI4,5P2 micelles (10–500 pmol), prepared as described in Huttelmaier et al. (20Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After intensive washing, bound PI4,5P2 was detected using a PI4,5P2-specific antibody (Assay Design Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antiserum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). A colorimetric reaction was developed using 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) as substrate, and absorption A 410 was measured in an ELISA reader. To compensate for variations in protein adsorption and development between assays, we normalized the values using the highest absorption as reference. The value of each data point is reported as the mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Because PKC effects on cell spreading have been observed during the early phase and flattening of cells (4Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Defilippi P. Venturino M. Gulino D. Duperray A. Boquet P. Fiorentini C. Volpe G. Palmieri M. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol.

(20Huttelmaier S. Mayboroda O. Harbeck B. Jarchau T. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)) and late time points during spreading. HeLa cells transfected with PKCα equipped with either a His or a BiPro tag were seeded onto collagen and allowed to adhere and spread for either 10–15 min or 16 h. To stabilize presumptive membrane-associated protein complexes, they were then treated with the membrane-permeant cross-linker DSP for a further 15 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed and rigorously extracted. PKCα was precipitated by either Ni-NTA-agarose or the BiPro-tag antibody, and precipitates were collected by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.1, vinculin precipitated with His-tagged PKCα (Fig. 1 A) and with BiPro-PKCα (Fig. 1 B) when cells were harvested at the early time point after seeding. In contrast, such co-precipitation was not observed with lysates obtained after long term culture (Fig. 1 B). Hence, these data support our hypothesis on a transient association between vinculin and PKCα. Early studies show that in vitrophosphorylation of vinculin by PKC requires acidic phospholipids (27Weekes J. Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,29Schwienbacher C. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that bind to the"

AP-2α is prominently expressed in cranial neural crest cells, a population of cells that migrate from the lateral margins of the brain plate during closure of the neural tube at day 8–9 of embryonic development. Homozygous AP-2α mutant mice die perinatally with cranio-abdominoschisis, full facial clefting, and defects in cranial ganglia and sensory organs, indicating the importance of this gene for proper development. By using a subtractive cloning approach, we identified a set of genes repressed by AP-2α that are described to retard cellular proliferation and induce differentiation and apoptosis. We show that these target genes are prematurely expressed in AP-2α mutant mice. One of the genes isolated, the Krüppel-box transcription factor KLF-4implicated in induction of terminal differentiation and growth regulation, is found expressed in mutant embryonic fibroblasts. We show that fibroblasts lacking AP-2α display retarded growth but no enhanced apoptosis. Based on these data we suggest thatAP-2α might be required for cell proliferation by suppression of genes inducing terminal differentiation, apoptosis, and growth retardation.

The family of AP-2 transcription factors consists of four different genes known as AP-2α, -β, -γ, and -δ, respectively (Tcfap2a, Tcfap2b, andTcfap2c-Mouse Genome Informatics) (1Bosher J.M. Totty N.F.

Sequence-specific binding to the consensus GCCN(3/4)GGC is mediated by a basic domain overlapping with the dimerization domain. The transcriptional activation is mediated by a proline/glutamine-rich cassette at the N terminus (6Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These domains are highly conserved in all three known AP-2 genes. During development, expression of AP-2α initiates around day 8 of embryonic development (E 1Eembryonic developmentGAPDHglyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRTreverse transcriptase 1Eembryonic developmentGAPDHglyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenasePBSphosphate-buffered salinePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenRTreverse transcriptase 8.0) in premigratory neural crest cells (8Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). During organogenesis expression ofAP-2α can be detected mainly in neural crest-derived tissue, kidney, and skin. Gene knockout experiments have shown that disruption of the AP-2α gene leads to a very severe body wall and neural tube closure phenotype with homozygous animals dying perinatally (9Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 10Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D.

Although a variety of genes have been proposed as targets for transcriptional regulation of AP-2α (reviewed in Ref. 11Hilger-Eversheim K. Moser M. Schorle H. Buettner R.

By using a single head of an E8.75 knockout and a control animal, we generated cDNA, which was subjected to suppression-subtractive hybridization. The success of the subtraction was demonstrated by virtual Northern blots with different known genes. We subjected 4800 recombinant clones to two rounds of differential screening using reverse Northern blots, and we isolated a total of 52 recombinant clones. Four genes from the screen for repressed genes, which we analyzed further, are known to be involved in growth control, differentiation, and apoptotic processes. The genes are KLF-4(Krüppel-like factor 4 (13Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol.

RT-PCR analyses confirmed that the genes were derepressed in the mutants. Most notably KLF-4 could be detected as early as E 8.5 in the mutant mesenchyme, whereas in wild-type animals KLF-4 can first be detected at E 10.5. Expression of theKLF-4 gene had been shown to induce cell cycle exit and terminal differentiation (18Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R. Kraft A.S.

In fact, fibroblasts derived from AP-2α mutant animals were shown to express KLF-4and displayed reduced proliferation. We conclude thatAP-2α might repress a set of target genes, which suppress cellular proliferation and induce terminal differentiation and apoptosis. The work outlined in this paper helps in understanding the molecular processes controlled by transcription factorAP-2α. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from a single embryo head at E 8.75 (exactly 18 somites) from a wild-type and an AP-2α-deficient specimen according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0) with the exception that the material was homogenized using a 16-gauge syringe before adding the lysis buffer. The quality of the isolated RNA was determined via RT-PCR with GAPDH and AP-2α (sequences of the primers available upon request). First and second strand synthesis was done using the SMART cDNA synthesis kit (CLONTECH, USA) after thorough optimization of the cycle number. To test the PCR being in the logarithmic phase, 1/10 of the cDNA was labeled and electrophoresed on an alkaline agarose gel. 50% of the poly(A)+ RNA was subjected to 25 cycles of PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolation of AP-2α up-regulated target genes was achieved by performing suppressive-subtractive hybridization protocol between wild type (“tester”) and AP-2-deficient (“driver”) cDNA using the PCR-select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH) with modifications as described (19von Stein O.D. Thies W.G. Hofmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) (referred to as forward screen). For genes repressed by AP-2α, the same procedure was used except that cDNA from AP-2α-deficient embryonic heads served as tester, and the wild type material was used as driver (referred to as reverse screen). For the first hybridization the mixture of driver and tester, cDNA was denatured at 100 °C for 20 s and then cooled over 1 min to 68 °C, and temperature was maintained for 8 h. For the second hybridization, driver cDNA was denatured at 100 °C for 20 s and then added to the pooled mixture of the previous hybridization and incubated at 68 °C for 20 h. Modifications of the manufacturer's protocol were done according to published procedures (19von Stein O.D. Thies W.G. Hofmann M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2598-2602Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified cDNA was digested with RsaI (a 4-base cutter) and HindIII linkers (HindIII linker, 5′-ATCGTCAAGCTTCAAGTTAGCATCG-3′ and 5′-GCTAACTTGAAGCTTGACGAT-3′) were ligated to the tester cDNA, andEcoRI linkers were ligated to the driver cDNA (EcoRI linker, 5′-TAGTCCGAATTCAAGCAAGAGCACA-3′ and 5′-CTCTTGCTTGAATTCGGACTA-3′). Free linkers were removed, and 1/500 of the ligated cDNA mixture was amplified with the appropriate primers in standard buffer (Amersham Biosciences AB) with 2 units ofTaq polymerase (30 cycles at 94 °C, 20 s; 52 °C, 20 s; and 72 °C, 2 min). For the subtracted cDNA, a nested PCR approach was used with the following conditions: 1st PCR, 27 cycles at 94 °C, 20 s; 68 °C, 20 s; 72 °C for 2 min; 2nd PCR, 12 cycles at 94 °C, 20 s; 68 °C, 20 s; 72 °C for 2 min. Equal amounts of the amplified material was run on an agarose gel (visualized under a UV transilluminator after staining with ethidium bromide), blotted, and subjected to hybridization under stringent conditions. A total of 4800 individual clones was picked and used to inoculate 96-well microtiter plates containing LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After incubation on a gyratory shaker for 4 h, a 10-μl aliquot was transferred to 50 μl of distilled water in PCR tubes. The bacteria were lysed by heating to 100 °C for 5 min, and then 40 μl of distilled water was added. Samples of 10 μl were used to amplify the cDNA inserts using M13 standard primers under standard conditions. (Note: clones containing no insert also did produce a band on the gel equal to the multiple cloning site.) The PCR products were run in duplicate on high density agarose gels (Centipede; Owl Scientific, Woburn, MA). PCR-amplified AP-2α and GAPDH cDNA was loaded and served as hybridization control. Gels were electrophoresed for 45 min at 100 V and photographed. The DNA was then denatured for 15 min in 0.4 n NaOH, blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes from wild type and mutant, respectively. For the labeling reaction 1/10 of the poly(A)+ RNA (Invitrogen FastTrack 2.0) from wild type and mutant embryonic heads stage E 8.75 was subjected to 15 cycles of PCR in the presence of [32P]CTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (SMART, CLONTECH). All hybridizations were carried out in Church hybridization buffer at 65 °C. The filters were exposed to x-ray film, and the respective bands were compared and referenced to loading position and intensity of the controls (AP-2α as well as GAPDH was run twice on each gel). Virtual Northern blots were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (SMART and PCR-Select subtraction manuals, CLONTECH). 500 ng of unsubtracted SMART cDNA and 500 ng of SMART cDNA after PCR-Select subtraction derived from both wild type and AP-2α-deficient mRNA was separated on an agarose gel, stained with EtBr, and transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences). The blots were then hybridized to [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR fragments of GAPDH and neomycin resistance gene under Church buffer conditions. For isolation of full-length cDNAs, two mouse embryo libraries (E 8.5 and E 10.5, Invitrogen) were pooled and plated. Filter lift assays were performed with pools of four recombinant fragments each. Colonies, which gave a positive signal, were picked using 1 ml of sterile Eppendorf tips, diluted in LB, and streaked onto 10-cm bacterial dishes. Filter lifts of these were cut into quarters and probed with individual fragments. Positive clones were picked, and the insert size was evaluated by restriction digest. Digoxigenin-labeled probes were generated using recombinant clones containing full-length cDNAs with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase. E 8.5–10.5 embryos were hybridized according to standard protocols as previously described (20Maldonado-Saldivia J. Funke B. Pandita R.K. Schuler T. Morrow B.E. Schorle H. Mech. Dev. 2000; 96: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (stratus.lifesci.ucla.edu/hhmi/derob). Murine fibroblasts were derived from timed matings at embryonic days 13.5–15.5. The head was cut off, and the internal organs were removed and used for genotyping. The embryo carcass was minced using fine scissors and digested with trypsin. After centrifugation and removal of cellular debris, cells were seeded on a 15-cm tissue culture dish (Greiner, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Germany). The cells were passaged 3 times to obtain a pure population of fibroblast cells. For growth curve analysis, 104 cells of each genotype were plated in a 6-cm tissue culture dish with gridlines (NUNC cell culture dish with a 2-mm grid, Nalgene-NUNC), and four individual grids were counted at the time indicated. For Northern analysis a 10-cm tissue culture dish of fibroblasts of passage 2 was harvested, and 10 μg of total RNA was loaded on an agarose gel, electrophoresed, and blotted on a nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed according to standard procedures with [32P]dCTP-labeled PCR fragments of probes indicated. Fibroblasts of passage 2 were plated on chamber slides (Lab-Tek II chamber slides, Nunc) and allowed to adhere overnight. After rinsing the cells once with PBS they were fixed with 10% formalin. After rinsing twice with distilled H2O, the cells were incubated in 2 n HCl for 10 min and then washed with distilled H2O and incubated in methanol, 0.3% H2O2 for 20 min. After rinsing in distilled H2O and PBS, two times respectively, the cells were blocked in PBS plus 10% horse serum plus 0.5% mouse serum for 10 min. Then they were rinsed in PBS and incubated with PCNA antibody diluted to 1:100 in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) for 1 h. After rinsing twice with PBS the cells were incubated with secondary antibody (1:50 in PBS) developed using the manufacturer's conditions (Vector ABC-Elite and AEC Kits) and counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s. Slides were embedded in immumount (Shandon-Lipshah, UK) and photographed using a Prog.Res. digital camera (Jenoptik, Germany) fitted to a Zeiss-Axiovert microscope (Zeiss, Germany). AP-2α mutant animals fail to close the cranial neural tube, an event that takes place between E 8.5 and 9.5 of murine development. The expression of AP-2α is first detected at E 8.0 in the apical neural fold and the lateral head mesenchyme. To isolate genes involved in the initial steps of the developing phenotype, we isolated embryos at age E 8.75. To ensure that we were using same age material, the somites were counted. Each embryo was genotyped using yolk sac DNA and PCR primers specific for theAP-2α locus. By using 18-somite embryos, RNA was generated from a single head of a wild-type as well as a knockout specimen. Then cDNA was generated and amplified (SMART cDNA synthesis kit,CLONTECH). These cDNAs were then used for a PCR-based subtraction, the suppressive-subtractive hybridization protocol (12Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar) (PCR-Select, CLONTECH). The screen for genes induced by AP-2α is referred to as “forward” screen (RNA from wild type was used as driver and RNA from AP-2α-deficient as tester). Genes repressed by AP-2α were identified using RNA from AP-2α mutants as driver and RNA from wild type as tester, termed “reverse” screen. After the forward- and reverse-subtracted cDNA libraries were generated, they were tested for the efficiency of the subtraction. The degree of subtraction can be determined by monitoring the enrichment of sequences specific to one population after subtraction and depletion of transcripts common to both populations. The G418 resistance gene, introduced to inactivate the AP-2α locus, is under ubiquitous expression driven by the phosphoglyceraldehyde transferase promoter and thereby serves as an excellent internal positive control that should be found enriched in the cDNA of the forward screen. Conversely glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, a housekeeping gene) should be depleted from the subtracted material. GAPDH was shown to be reduced ∼1000-fold in the subtracted compared with the unsubtracted material of both the forward and the reverse subtractions (Fig.1 A), whereas the neomycin cDNA was found enriched ∼50-fold in the forward direction (Fig.1 B). Taken together, the results indicate that the population of cDNA had been successfully subtracted, and the highly expressed housekeeping genes like GAPDH had been eliminated or greatly reduced. So we could conclude that both subtractions of the cDNA worked to a high efficiency, and the subtracted cDNA libraries could be transformed into a cloning vector for the screening procedure. For the identification of genes regulated by AP-2α 2400 colonies of each subtracted cDNA library were picked and the cDNA fragments amplified by colony PCR. Each cDNA fragment was then separated on two high density gels in parallel (Fig.1 C), blotted, and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA derived from wild-type (Fig. 1 D, upper panel) and AP-2α-deficient embryos (Fig. 1 D, lower panel). In the first round we identified 254 clones in the forward and 234 clones in the reverse screen as being differentially expressed. We re-screened these clones in a second round and used only the clones with the most striking differences in signal. Taken together, we performed two rounds of reverse Northern to screen 4800 clones from both the forward and reverse direction, and we found 52 clones being differentially expressed. Due to extreme limitation of mRNA material, we performed virtual Northern blots to verify that a given clone is in fact differentially expressed. Thirty clones were tested this way (data not shown), and 95% showed the expected differential expression pattern. All 52 clones were sequenced and analyzed using the BLAST server to determine the nature of the sequence. As depicted in TableI, sequence analysis showed that the 52 clones encode for 46 different genes (25 known and 21 novel cDNAs) indicating that we had isolated some genes several times.Table IResult of the screen for genes regulated by AP-2αClonecDNA sizeGene nameHomologies toRemarksGenBank™ accession no.Genes induced by AP-2α fl01799 bpCytochromec oxidase(Polypeptide I)Three times isolated13841 fl02716 bpUnknownIsolated from in vitro fertilized eggs cDNA; zinc (RING) finger domainAK018364 fl031559 bpGlutathione peroxidase 3NM 008161 fl043.0 kbUnknownHuman CGl-18Drosophila Dp 1Small homologies fl053.6 kbUnknownKinase and/or zinc finger fl061208 bpGrpE-like 1, mitochondrial (Grpel1), mRNANM_024478 fl072.0 kbUnknowncDNA cloneBC005647 fl081312 bpUnknownHuman cDNA clone p586c1620Probably zinc finger domain fl092.5 kbSNAP 23AB000822 fl101.5 kbProlactin-related proteinThree times isolatedAF011385 fl122508 bpUnknownRat dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase (d90401) fl131.5 kb26 S proteasomal ATPaseU61283 fl14889 bpMouse homologue of MCT-1Human MCT-1 (93%)AI159705 fl151095 bpUnknownIsolated from mouse early blastocyst cDNA; Gly- and His-rich, zinc fingerC88842 fl16826 bpUnknownRat hypertension-related protein (u41803)Transmembrane protein fl172.1 kbSelenoprotein PAF021345 fl181.9 kbPoly(A)-binding protein IIU93050 fl19630 bp60 S ribosomal protein L18I04128 fl201730 bpUnknownIsolated from male kidney cDNAAK002518 fl21485 bpUnknownIsolated from mouse cDNA, probably phosphataseAI550416Genes repressed by AP-2α fl22A3.0 kbAnnexin, Lipocortin 1 fl22B2.9 kbKrüppel-like factor 4U20344 fl231404 bpLipocortin 1X07486 fl242164 bpSyntaxin-7AF056323 fl522921 bpSca-1 (stem cell antigen-1)M74013.1 fl531880 bpUnknownHuman EFEMP-1XM_002258 fl542337 bpUnknown fl551894 bpUnknown(AF362729) Mus musculusion transport regulator CHIF (Fxyd4) gene fl561873 bpStra13(bHLH, RA inducible)AF010305 fl572067 bpBc 10AB037891 fl581457 bpMtd(Apoptosis activator)AF027707 fl602375 bpUnknownVarious mouse ESTs fl62928 bpOSF-3/pag-1D21252 fl64470 bpUnknownUbiquitin/60 S ribosomal fusion proteinAF118402 fl65570 bpUnknownVarious mouse ESTsReceptor or zinc finger fl66580 bpSurf-3AH002086 fl67770 bpSaposinS36200 fl681076 bpAcidic ribosomal phosphoproteinX15267 fl69535 bpRibosomal subunit S5Y12431 fl702620 bpmCDC46D26090 fl712187 bpUnknownVarious mouse ESTsSurface glycoprotein fl72718 bpTRBP 107X81987 fl733012 bpUnknownHomo sapiens ring finger protein 11 (RNF11) (XM_001379) fl743844 bpUnknown(AF205855)M. musculus serum and glucocorticoid-dependent protein kinase (Sgk)Kinase domain fl751466 bpUnknown(BC015399) H. sapiens, similar to glutathione peroxidase 3Isolated from M. musculus adult male kidney cDNAAK002219 fl761565 bpUnknownVarious mESTs fl772085 bpUnknownHuman cDNA clone KIAA0674 (weak) fl78891 bpProlactin-related proteinAF011385 fl791660 bpUnknownIsolated from pregnant adult female cDNA, transmembrane domainAK019865Clones found in the screen for genes induced and repressed are shown.

To clone full-length cDNA of the clones, we screened a commercial cDNA library stage E 8.5 and E 10.5 (Invitrogen). 500,000 clones were hybridized with pools of four fragments. Positive signals were picked and rescreened with the individual fragment. After determination of the insert size the clones were used for sequence analysis. The full-length clones obtained were subjected to a whole mountin situ screen to detect genes expressed in structures affected by the AP-2α knockout phenotype. Fig. 1 (E–H) shows a panel of genes that are derived from the screen for repressed genes, Stra13 (Fig. 1 E), mEFEMP-1(epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein-1, Fig. 1 F), Mtd (Matador 1, Fig.1 G), and KLF-4 (Krüppel-like factor 4, Fig.1 G). The transcriptional repressor Stra13 had been described to be expressed at day E 9.5 in Rhombomere 5 (17Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We were able to reproduce these data and moreover detected Stra13 RNA in tip of the tail and in the mesenchyme surrounding the dorsal aorta at E 9.5 (Fig.1 E, arrowheads). Stra13 had been reported to induce growth arrest and terminal differentiation in cell culture (17Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Our screen resulted in cloning of the murine homologue ofEFEMP-1, an extracellular matrix protein that was found overexpressed in senescent and quiescent fibroblast cultures and a patient with Werner syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by accelerated aging (15Lecka-Czernik B. Lumpkin C.K., Jr. Goldstein S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 120-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We see mEFEMP-1 in cells of the paraxial mesenchyme in the hindbrain and in a fine, distinct line in the trunk (Fig. 1 F, arrow). Mtd (or bok1), a member of the Bcl-2 family, had been described to be expressed in the brain, liver, and lymphoid tissues and to activate apoptosis (16Inohara N. Ekhterae D. Garcia I. Carrio R.

Ourin situ analysis revealed expression in limb bud and paraxial mesenchyme in the trunk and craniofacial mesenchyme at E 10.5 (Fig. 1 G, arrowheads). Krüppel-like factor-4, KLF-4, is published to be expressed in the epithelial cells of the mucosa of the gut (23Ton-That H. Kaestner K.H. Shields J.M. Mahatanankoon C.S. Yang V.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, we see expression in a highly regionalized pattern in the frontonasal area, the first and second branchial arch, the apical ectodermal ridge of the limb buds, and the dorsal root ganglia in the trunk (Fig. 1 H, arrowheads). Many lines of evidence suggest that KLF-4 expression is indicative for growth arrest and differentiation. For example, NIH 3T3 cells are found to express KLF-4 under serum deprivation or upon contact inhibition (18Zhang W. Geiman D.E. Shields J.M. Dang D.T. Mahatan C.S. Kaestner K.H. Biggs J.R.

PMT-3 cells, which are transfected with a plasmid expressing KLF-4, show reduced thymidine uptake as well as greatly diminished DNA synthesis as determined with bromodeoxyuridine labeling (14Shields J.M.

Taken together, the genes repressed by AP-2α retard the cell cycle and induce terminal differentiation and apoptosis. We had subjected a subtracted library from E 8.75 wild type and mutant material to an in situ screen, which was aimed to detect genes that display a distinct and overlapping expression pattern compared with AP-2α. For a target gene to be involved in the cranio-abdominoschisis, it had not only to be expressed in the similar structures but also at the gestational time the mutant embryo would start to display phenotypic alterations. Hence, we decided to concentrate the next analysis around stag"
https://openalex.org/W2152995924,"Genetic analysis of Ras signaling has unveiled the participation of non-enzymatic accessory proteins in signal transmission. These proteins, KSR, CNK, and Sur-8, can interact with multiple core components of the Ras/MAP kinase cascade and may contribute to the structural organization of this cascade. However, the precise biochemical nature of the contribution of these proteins to Ras signaling is currently unknown. Here we show directly that CNK and KSR are required for stimulus dependent Raf kinase activation. CNK is required for membrane recruitment of Raf, while KSR is likely required to couple Raf to upstream kinases. These results demonstrate that CNK and KSR are integral components of the cellular machinery mediating Raf activation."

A pentasaccharide sequence found in heparin activates antithrombin by inducing conformational changes that affect the reactive center of the inhibitor resulting in optimal recognition by factor Xa. The mechanism of transmission of the activating conformational change from the heparin-binding region to the reactive center loop remains unresolved. To investigate the role of helix D elongation in the allosteric activation of antithrombin, we substituted a proline residue for Lys133. Heparin binding affinity was reduced by 25-fold for the proline variant compared with the control, and a significant decrease in the associated intrinsic fluorescence enhancement was also observed. Rapid kinetic studies revealed that the main reason for the reduced affinity for heparin was an increase in the rate of the reverse conformational change step. The pentasaccharide-accelerated rate of factor Xa inhibition for the proline variant was 10-fold lower than control, demonstrating that the proline variant cannot be fully activated toward factor Xa. We conclude that helix D elongation is critical for the full conversion of antithrombin to its high affinity, activated state, and we propose a mechanism to explain how helix D elongation is coupled to allosteric activation.

Heparin binding is a two-step process with an initial weak interaction followed by an activating conformational change to a high affinity state (8Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific pentasaccharide sequence found in a fraction of heparin chains is required for tight binding and full induction of the activating conformational change in antithrombin (9Oscarsson L.G. Pejler G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 296-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in isolation accelerates the rate of factor Xa inhibition by ∼300-fold (10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pentasaccharide binding site was defined in 1997 with the completion of the crystallographic structure of the antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex (Fig. 1) (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The structure confirmed predictions that the pentasaccharide interacts with a region of positively charged residues located primarily on helix D (12Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), however, in a more compact manner than previously expected (13van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with basic residues 132, 133, and 136 not within hydrogen-bonding distances. Binding of the pentasaccharide resulted in a global conformational change in antithrombin, including secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region, expulsion of the preinserted reactive center loop hinge region from β-sheet A, closure of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form found in all other known native serpin structures, and associated tertiary structural changes (Fig. 1). In the heparin-binding region, the pentasaccharide induced a two-turn elongation of helix D at its C terminus, a new one-turn P-helix at its N terminus, and a one-turn elongation at the N terminus of helix A. Importantly, the P- and A-helix extensions are structural changes common to both latent and inhibitory molecules upon pentasaccharide binding, whereas the elongation of helix D occurs only in the inhibitory molecule (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The resulting expulsion of the reactive center loop from β-sheet A was once thought to be the sole basis of improved inhibition of factor Xa and was thus considered to be the activating conformational change (14Olson S.T. Bjork I. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1994; 20: 373-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,15Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has since been discovered that pentasaccharide activation of antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa is insensitive to the reactive center loop sequence and that determinants of allosteric activation lie outside this region (16Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, loop expulsion either exposes exosites or allows simultaneous binding to the reactive center and to the exosites as observed in the heparin cofactor II-S195A thrombin structure (18Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; (Abstr. OC61)PubMed Google Scholar) (1JMO). In any case, it is clear that loop expulsion to the five-stranded β-sheet A form is a critical determinant of activation.Despite the crystal structures, the mechanism behind the heparin-induced activation of antithrombin remains unclear. In 1994, based solely on the structure of native antithrombin and molecular dynamics simulations, van Boeckel et al. (13van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism whereby charge neutralization at the heparin binding region would cause helix D elongation, resulting in strain on strand 2A and thus the collapse of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form (4Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Sci. Prog. 2001; 84: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model was largely validated by the structure of the pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin. Heparin binding did result in expulsion of the reactive center loop and a collapse to the five-stranded form, and helix D elongation was observed. However, helix D elongation was not caused by the direct binding of residues C-terminal to helix D (Arg132, Lys133, and Lys136) to the pentasaccharide, and thus it remained unclear as to whether helix D was elongated as the result of more distant electrostatic forces or other conformational changes in antithrombin. A modified version of the van Boeckel model was recently proposed (19Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which suggested that subtle perturbations of surface electrostatics, induced by pentasaccharide binding, shift the position of an equilibrium from the native to the activated conformation. Whatever the mode of transmission, it is reasonable to hypothesize that helix D extension plays a critical part in the activating conformational change, based on the fact that helix D elongation is uniquely observed in the active antithrombin component of the pentasaccharide-bound crystallographic dimer (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar).Prolines have long been known as helix breakers (20Woolfson D.N. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In antithrombin, two natural variants, S116P and N118P, were found associated with thrombosis due to a deficiency in heparin binding (21Okajima K. Abe H. Maeda S. Motomura M. Tsujihata M. Nagataki S. Okabe H. Takatsuki K. Blood. 1993; 81: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of antithrombin bound to the heparin pentasaccharide provides an explanation of this deficiency, since prolines at the N terminus of helix D would inhibit the formation of the P helix. We followed a similar approach to investigate the role of helix D elongation in the activating conformational change of antithrombin by mutating residue Lys133 to proline. An alanine variant was also created to serve as a neutral control. We demonstrate that helix D elongation is coupled to the activating conformational change and is crucial for trapping the equilibrium in the activated state.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to determine the role of helix D elongation in the allosteric activation of antithrombin. We examined the effect of a proline substitution at Lys133 in the extended heparin-binding region and found that a blocking or distortion of the extension of helix D resulted in the inability to become fully activated, as measured by fluorescence enhancement and kinetics of inhibition. Rapid heparin binding studies indicated that the reason full activation was not achieved is that the conformational changes that stabilize the high affinity state were perturbed. Thus, helix D elongation is not required for the forward steps but is a major contributing factor to the stabilization of the activated state.Such a conclusion is supported by the properties and structures of the six-stranded forms of antithrombin. Crystal structures of several β-sheet A-expanded, six-stranded forms of antithrombin have been solved, including cleaved, latent, and peptide-complexed (33Mourey L. Samama J.P. Delarue M. Petitou M. Choay J. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Skinner R. Abrahams J.P. Whisstock J.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. J. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants for pentasaccharide binding to all of these conformers are around 20 μm (35Skinner R. Chang W.S. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) which is similar to the dissociation constant for native antithrombin preceding the activating conformational change (K 1 in Scheme 1) (8Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the conformational changes responsible for the high affinity state cannot occur when β-sheet A is six-stranded or indeed that the conformational change that leads to the high affinity state is simply closure of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form. Proof that helix D elongation is conformationally linked to the closing of β-sheet A and the expulsion of the reactive center loop is provided by the structure of latent antithrombin bound to the pentasaccharide (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Although the pentasaccharide is bound in the same position in the latent and inhibitory conformers, and therefore the latent molecule is sampling the same neutralization of basic residues in the heparin binding region, helix D is not elongated in the latent molecule, whereas the other secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region, helix A elongation and helix P formation, were common to both latent and inhibitory forms of antithrombin when bound to the pentasaccharide.A further indication of the importance of the region C-terminal to helix D is provided by studies on variants with truncations in the loop stretching from helix D to s2A (36Meagher J.L. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2698-2704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Truncation of one or several amino acids starting at position 134 resulted in reduced intrinsic fluorescence enhancement, affinity for heparin, and pentasaccharide-catalyzed rate of factor Xa inhibition. The authors concluded that truncations in this region somehow decoupled heparin binding from expulsion of the reactive center loop. For a perfectly coupled equilibrium between a native, low affinity, low fluorescence, low anti-factor Xa activity state, A, and a heparin-bound, high affinity, high fluorescence, high anti-factor Xa activity state, B, the observed rate of factor Xa inhibition and the level of intrinsic fluorescence enhancement would correlate the B/A ratio (Fig.4 a). Since most of the heparin-induced fluorescence enhancement is due to the closing of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form and associated tertiary structural changes (27Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a 2-fold lower fluorescence enhancement would imply either a B/A ratio 2-fold higher for the variant in the absence of heparin or a B/A ratio 2-fold lower in the presence of heparin. If the B/A ratio were 2-fold higher in the absence of heparin, the basal rate of factor Xa inhibition would be half that of the fully catalyzed rate, and if the B/A ratio in the presence of saturating heparin were 2-fold lower, then a 2-fold reduction in the catalyzed rate of factor Xa inhibition would be expected. However, whether the helix D loop is truncated (36Meagher J.L. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2698-2704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) or perturbed by the incorporation of a proline, a 2–3-fold decrease in intrinsic fluorescence enhancement corresponds to areduction in basal rate of factor Xa inhibition and a10-fold decrease in the maximal pentasaccharide-catalyzed rate of factor Xa inhibition. This would suggest that the intrinsic fluorescence is decoupled from activation as the result of an altered activated conformation, B′. Thus, although the B′ state is fully populated at saturation, its intrinsic fluorescence and inhibitory activity toward factor Xa are significantly reduced relative to B. A model for B′ would need to explain both properties. It is known that the fluorescent state of antithrombin is related to the state of β-sheet A, with the five-stranded form of highest quantum yield. The rate of reaction with factor Xa is also sensitive to the state of β-sheet A, with peptide-annealed, six-stranded forms reacting at a rate ∼10-fold lower than the pentasaccharide-activated form despite having a fully exposed reactive center loop (32Bjork I. Nordling K. Larsson I. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19047-19050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Skinner R. Chang W.S. Jin L. Pei X. Huntington J.A. Abrahams J.P. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the conformation of B′ has a fully expelled reactive center loop with a more open β-sheet A configuration, as shown in Fig. 4 b. Such a conformation is consistent with our observations of lower thermal stability and more ready incorporation of an exogenous peptide for the pentasaccharide-bound form of the K133P variant.What role then does helix D elongation play in the conformational activation of antithrombin? It is clear from this study that its major role is the stabilization of the activated, five-stranded conformation. In a previous paper, we suggested that the major stabilizing interactions were electrostatic and, in particular, involved the formation of favorable interactions with Glu381 (P13) (19Huntington J.A. McCoy A. Belzar K.J. Pei X.Y. Gettins P.G.W. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15377-15383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glu381 forms a network of ionic interactions with s2A residue Lys139 and helix F residue Arg197, which also both interact with Glu195. However, helix D elongation does not appear to be required for the formation of these interactions. So which favorable interactions depend on helix D elongation? There are two electrostatic interactions between Arg129 and Lys133 with Glu414, but since the K133A mutation does not significantly affect pentasaccharide binding, these cannot contribute significantly to the energetics of helix D elongation. Furthermore, the Lys133-Glu414 interaction is maintained in the latent antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex.Structural analysis of various antithrombin conformations indicates that a major effect of helix D elongation is an alteration in the packing of hydrophobic residues underlying the helix. Helix D has long been considered a basic helix, but it is in fact amphipathic, consisting of Ile119, Phe121, Phe122, Phe123,Leu126, Leu130, andTyr131, with underlined residues on the hydrophobic face of the helix. The most striking feature unique to the activated, five-stranded conformer is the side chain position of Tyr131. Tyr131 is buried between helix D and s2A in native, cleaved, latent, latent bound-to-pentasaccharide, and peptide-complexed forms, and is flipped out in the pentasaccharide-activated state, exposing a large hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 5). Is it possible that the substitution of a lysine with a proline at a position two residues downstream from Tyr131 could affect its ability to flip out of the hydrophobic pocket in response to heparin binding? The effect of prolines on α-helices has been extensively studied, and the incorporation of a proline into a helix results in a distortion caused by the loss of main chain hydrogen bonds and steric clashes (20Woolfson D.N. Williams D.H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both the loss of hydrogen bonds and the steric clashes occur with main chain carbonyl oxygens of residues preceding the proline in the α-helix, resulting in a destabilization of the helix and a kink extending both C- and N-terminally. The proline at position 133 could thus affect the position of the Tyr131 as well as disrupting downstream helix elongation. The possible role of the tyrosine side chain position in β-sheet expansion in antithrombin is supported by similar behavior in PAI-1. Cleaved (37De Aertgeerts K. De Bondt H.L. Ranter C. Declerck P.J. Proteins. 1995; 23: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), latent (38Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), and peptide-complexed (39Xue Y. Bjorquist P. Inghardt T. Linschoten M. Musil D. Sjolin L. Deinum J. Structure. 1998; 6: 627-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) structures of PAI-1 have Tyr79 (Tyr102 in the unprocessed chain) oriented in the cleft between helix D and s2A, as in all six-stranded forms of antithrombin, and flipped out of the pocked in the active five-stranded form. A similar but much smaller cavity has been identified in native α1-antitrypsin (40Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Elliott P.R. Pei X.Y. Dafforn T.R. Lomas D.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). It is possible that compounds that specifically bind to this pocket in antithrombin may stabilize the five-stranded form and favor the activated conformation over native in the absence of heparin. Studies are currently under way to investigate the role of Tyr131on the allosteric activation of antithrombin and to characterize the binding of small organic compounds to the hydrophobic cavity.Figure 5Exposure of a large hydrophobic pocket upon conformational activation of antithrombin. Native (left) and pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin (right) are shown as α-carbon worm representations for orientation (a) and as surface contours (b), colored green according to hydrophobicity. The structures of all six-stranded forms of antithrombin resemble native in the orientation of Tyr131 (yellow), which occupies a hydrophobic pocket between helix D and s2A. In the activated conformation, Tyr131 flips out, creating a large hydrophobic pocket indicated by the red oval. This figure was made using Grasp (44Nicholls A. Honig B. J. Comput.

Heparin binding is a two-step process with an initial weak interaction followed by an activating conformational change to a high affinity state (8Olson S.T. Srinivasan K.R. Bjork I. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11073-11079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A specific pentasaccharide sequence found in a fraction of heparin chains is required for tight binding and full induction of the activating conformational change in antithrombin (9Oscarsson L.G. Pejler G. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 296-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in isolation accelerates the rate of factor Xa inhibition by ∼300-fold (10Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pentasaccharide binding site was defined in 1997 with the completion of the crystallographic structure of the antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex (Fig. 1) (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The structure confirmed predictions that the pentasaccharide interacts with a region of positively charged residues located primarily on helix D (12Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), however, in a more compact manner than previously expected (13van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), with basic residues 132, 133, and 136 not within hydrogen-bonding distances. Binding of the pentasaccharide resulted in a global conformational change in antithrombin, including secondary structural changes in the heparin binding region, expulsion of the preinserted reactive center loop hinge region from β-sheet A, closure of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form found in all other known native serpin structures, and associated tertiary structural changes (Fig. 1). In the heparin-binding region, the pentasaccharide induced a two-turn elongation of helix D at its C terminus, a new one-turn P-helix at its N terminus, and a one-turn elongation at the N terminus of helix A. Importantly, the P- and A-helix extensions are structural changes common to both latent and inhibitory molecules upon pentasaccharide binding, whereas the elongation of helix D occurs only in the inhibitory molecule (11Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The resulting expulsion of the reactive center loop from β-sheet A was once thought to be the sole basis of improved inhibition of factor Xa and was thus considered to be the activating conformational change (14Olson S.T. Bjork I. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1994; 20: 373-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,15Pike R.N. Potempa J. Skinner R. Fitton H.L. McGraw W.T. Travis J. Owen M. Jin L. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19652-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It has since been discovered that pentasaccharide activation of antithrombin inhibition of factor Xa is insensitive to the reactive center loop sequence and that determinants of allosteric activation lie outside this region (16Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Chuang Y.J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, loop expulsion either exposes exosites or allows simultaneous binding to the reactive center and to the exosites as observed in the heparin cofactor II-S195A thrombin structure (18Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; (Abstr. OC61)PubMed Google Scholar) (1JMO). In any case, it is clear that loop expulsion to the five-stranded β-sheet A form is a critical determinant of activation. Despite the crystal structures, the mechanism behind the heparin-induced activation of antithrombin remains unclear. In 1994, based solely on the structure of native antithrombin and molecular dynamics simulations, van Boeckel et al. (13van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism whereby charge neutralization at the heparin binding region would cause helix D elongation, resulting in strain on strand 2A and thus the collapse of β-sheet A to the five-stranded form (4Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Sci. Prog. 2001; 84: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model was largely validated by the structure of the pentasaccharide-activated antithrombin. Heparin binding did result in expulsion of the reactive center loop and a collapse to the five-stranded form, and helix D elongation was observed. However, helix D elongation was not caused by the direct binding of residues C-terminal to helix D (Arg132, Lys133, and Lys136) to the pentasaccharide, and thus it remained unclear as to whether helix D was elongated as the result of more distant electrostatic forces or other conformational changes in antithrombin.

UV-induced vanadate (Vi) cleavage experiments demonstrated that only one hydrolysis event can occur at a time (21Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V., Ko, Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Pastan I.

All these observations have led to the first catalytic model, proposed by Senior et al. (22Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), which postulates that Pgp functions by alternating hydrolysis of ATP at the two NBDs. Moreover, to mediate drug binding and subsequent release in the external medium, changes in drug-binding affinity and/or drug-binding site accessibility must occur during the catalytic cycle. The 10-Å resolution structure determined by electron cryomicroscopy of two-dimensional crystals of Pgp (23Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated the repacking of the transmembrane domains during the transport ATPase cycle. It remains contradictory, however, whether it is ATP binding or the ADP/Pi transition step that mediates the restructuring of the membrane-embedded domains of Pgp during the transport process (23Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar,25Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2515-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). One of the unresolved problems in the understanding of the transport mechanism of Pgp is whether both NBDs are equivalent and thus interchangeable or whether each has its own structure and function in the catalytic cycle of the protein. The notion that NBDs in ABC transporters are asymmetric has been demonstrated in a broad variety of systems. Indeed, in the case of eucaryotes, the two NBDs of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (26Gadsby D.C. Nairn A.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S77-S107Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), multidrug resistance-associated protein-1 (27Hou Y. Cui L. Riordan J.R. Chang X. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22107-22113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) have been shown to have distinguishable activities and functions. The results obtained so far for Pgp remain contradictory. On the basis of photoaffinity labeling experiments using ATP derivatives, Sauna and Ambudkar (30Sauna Z.E. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11653-11661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have proposed that in wild-type (WT) Pgp, the NBDs play the same function. However, applying the same photoaffinity labeling approach to Pgp mutated in the NBDs or to chimeric Pgp, Hrycyna et al.(31Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Germann U.A. Cheng P.W. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13887-13899Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) concluded that the two NBDs are essential, but not symmetric. Many other groups have studied the effect of homologous mutations in the two NBDs of Pgp. Depending on the nature of the residue that was replaced, the NBDs appear to be symmetric or not (32Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11921-11927Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33Takada Y. Yamada K. Taguchi Y. Kino K. Matsuo M. Tucker S.J. Komano T. Amachi T. Ueda K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For instance, recent studies have investigated the role of glutamates 552 and 1197 within the NBDs of Pgp encoded by the mdr3 gene (34Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Substitution with their uncharged homologs causes a complete loss of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Indeed, mutants E1197Q and E552Q are able to bind and hydrolyze ATP, but are unable to release Pi and/or ADP after the hydrolysis event, as demonstrated by Vi-induced trapping of ADP. However, differences in photolabeling by radionucleotides seem to reflect functional differences between the two NBDs (34Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Considering the confusing conclusions in which the techniques used so far have resulted, we decided to use a completely different approach, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, to investigate directly from a structural point of view the possible existence of an asymmetry between the two NBDs of Pgp. For this purpose, WT Pgp and two mutations of homologous residues in each NBD were studied. ATP, ATPγS, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and Vi were from Sigma. D2O was from Merck. Bio-Beads SM-2 were from Bio-Rad. Asolectin (soybean phospholipids; Sigma) was purified according to the method described (35Kagawa J. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5477-5487Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C in chloroform. Hoechst 33342 was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid was from QIAGEN Inc. WT mouse MDR3 Pgp and also Pgp mutants bearing single mutations in the Walker B sequence signature of NBD1 (E552Q) and NBD2 (E1197Q) were constructed in the pHIL-D2 plasmid vector (Invitrogen) and overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris as previously described (34Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 36Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13887-13899Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The conditions of expression, solubilization, and purification on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin of WT and mutant Pgp from 2-liter cultures induced by methanol were as described (34Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A dried film of 12.5 mg of asolectin was obtained by evaporation of chloroform under a flow of nitrogen, followed by overnight drying under vacuum. Liposomes were prepared by sonication of the lipid film for 7 min on a Vibra 250W cell sonifier in 6.5 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 75 mm NaCl).n-Dodecyl β-d-maltoside was added to 520 μl of the sonicated lipid suspension to obtain a 1:0.85 (w/w) lipid/detergent ratio. Buffer A was added to obtain a final volume of 750 μl. The mixture was stirred for 20 min at room temperature. 50 μg of purified protein was added to the lipid/detergent mixed micelles, and the volume was adjusted to 1 ml with buffer A. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature. The detergent was then removed by addition of Bio-Beads SM-2 (three incubations of 2 h under continuous stirring in the presence of 80 mg of Bio-Beads). To demonstrate the association of proteins with lipids, the supernatant collected from the Bio-Beads mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose was overlaid with a 30 to 5% sucrose linear gradient and centrifuged overnight at 120,000 × g and 4 °C in a Beckman L7 ultracentrifuge with an SW 60 rotor. The gradient was fractionated, and phospholipid and protein distributions along the gradient were determined by enzymatic colorimetric assay of the phosphatidylcholine and tryptophan fluorescence, respectively. To eliminate the sucrose, the fractions containing the proteoliposomes were washed twice by centrifugation in 3 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 2 h at 150,000 × g and then resuspended in ∼20 μl of the same buffer. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from ATP using a colorimetric method adapted from Ref. 37Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar. The liberation of Pi was quantified after 1 h of incubation of the samples (containing 1–2 μg of Pgp reconstituted into liposomes) in the presence of 3 mm MgATP at 37 °C. The contribution of the free hydrolysis of MgATP in the colorimetric assay was subtracted. 25 μl of proteoliposomes was added to 870 μl of buffer A. After 30 s of data acquisition, 35 μl of 100 μmHoechst 33342 was added. 300 μl of a 13 mm MgATP or MgATPγS solution was added after 70 s to reach a final concentration of 3 mm. A control experiment was performed by addition of 300 μl of buffer A to eliminate the effect of dilution on fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence was monitored on an SLM-AMINCO 8000 fluorimeter using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355 and 457 nm, respectively. ATR-FTIR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled mercury/cadmium/telluride detector at a nominal resolution of 4 cm−1 and encoded every 1 cm−1. The spectrophotometer was continuously purged with air. The internal reflection element (ATR) was a germanium plate (50 × 20 × 2 mm, Harrick EJ2121) with an aperture angle of 45°, yielding 25 internal reflections (38Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). For each spectrum used for the determination of the secondary structure, 512 scan cycles were averaged. For each kinetic time point, 24 scan cycles were recorded and averaged. The sample contained 20 μg of reconstituted WT or mutant Pgp. 0.5 μl of a 6 mmnucleotide solution and/or 3 μl of 10 mm Viwas added to the reconstituted protein. Under these conditions, the molar ratio of Pgp to nucleotides was 1:5. Thin films of oriented multilayers were then obtained by slowly evaporating the sample on one side of the ATR plate in a stream of nitrogen (38Goormaghtigh E. Raussens V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 105-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 39Fringeli U. Günthard H. Mol. Biol. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 31: 270-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The ATR plate was sealed in a universal sample holder. The sample on the ATR plate was rehydrated by flushing D2O-saturated N2 for 2 h at room temperature. The determination of the secondary structure was based on the vibrational bands of the protein and particularly the amide I band (1600–1700 cm−1), which is sensitive to the secondary structure (40Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). This amide I band, located in a region of the spectrum that is often free of other bands, is composed of 80% pure C=O vibration. The analysis was performed on the amide I region of deuterated samples because the amide H/D exchange allows differentiation of the α-helical secondary structure from the random secondary structure whose absorption band shifts from ∼1655 to ∼1642 cm−1 (41Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Fourier self-deconvolution was applied to increase the resolution of the spectra in the amide I region. The self-deconvolution was carried out using a lorentzian line shape for the deconvolution and a gaussian line shape for the apodization (40Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To quantify the area of the different components of amide I revealed by self-deconvolution, least-squares iterative curve fitting was performed to fit lorentzian line shapes to the spectrum between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 (42Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To avoid the introduction of artifacts due to the self-deconvolution procedure, fitting was performed on the non-deconvoluted spectrum. The proportion of a particular structure is the sum of the area of all the fitted lorentzian bands with their maxima in the frequency region where that structure occurs divided by the total area of amide I. The frequency limits for each structure were first assigned according to theoretical (43Krimm S. Bandekar J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1986; 38: 181-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2718) Google Scholar) or experimental (44Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar) data: α-helix, 1662 to 1645 cm−1; β-sheet, 1689 to 1682 cm−1 and 1637 to 1613 cm−1; random structure, 1644.5 to 1637 cm−1; and β-turn, 1682 to 1662.5 cm−1. Films containing 20 μg of reconstituted Pgp in the presence or absence of nucleotides were prepared on a germanium plate as described above. Nitrogen was saturated with D2O by bubbling in a series of three vials containing D2O. Before starting the deuteration, 10 spectra of the sample were recorded to test the stability of the measurements and the reproducibility of the area determination. At zero time, the D2O-saturated N2 flux, at a flow rate of 100 ml/min (controlled by a Brooks flow meter), was connected to the sample. The signal from the atmospheric water was subtracted as described by Goormaghtigh and Ruysschaert (45Goormaghtigh E. Ruysschaert J.-M. Spectrochim. Acta. 1994; 50: 2137-2144Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The area of amide II, characteristic of the δ(N–H) vibration, was obtained by integration between 1596 and 1502 cm−1. For each spectrum, the area of amide II was divided by the corresponding lipidic ν(C=O) area to correct for any change in total intensity of the spectra during the deuteration process (41Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 363-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This ratio (expressed as a percentage) was plotted versus deuteration time. The 100% value is defined by the amide II/lipid ratio obtained before deuteration. The 0% value corresponds to a zero absorption in the amide II region, observed for full deuteration of the protein. Reconstitution of WT and mutant Pgp was performed by mixing the purified proteins with n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside-destabilized asolectin vesicles. Detergent was removed by adsorption on polystyrene beads. Proteoliposomes were layered at the bottom of a linear sucrose gradient; and after centrifugation, the gradient was fractionated from the bottom of the tube. Comigration of the proteins and the lipids as a single band demonstrated that proteoliposomes had been formed (data not shown). The proteoliposome population was quite homogeneous, and no aggregates were detectable at the bottom of the gradient. The fractions containing proteoliposomes were pooled and washed twice by centrifugation in 3 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The proteoliposomes were formed at a 1:22 (w/w) protein/lipid ratio, and 50% of the protein was recovered after these washing steps. The ATPase activity of reconstituted WT Pgp was ∼150 ± 20 nmol/min/mg of Pgp in the presence of 3 mm MgATP and was 2–3-fold stimulated by addition of 10 μm verapamil and up to 5-fold stimulated by 50 μm verapamil. This specific activity of murine Pgp is very similar to that previously determined (19Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46Dong M. Penin F. Baggetto L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28875-28883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The orientation of Pgp into liposomes was investigated by comparison of its ATPase activity before and after permeabilization of the liposomes in the presence of 2 mm CHAPS (47Sharom F.J., Yu, X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This CHAPS concentration has been previously shown to permeabilize the proteoliposomes without modifying the ATPase activity of Pgp (47Sharom F.J., Yu, X. Doige C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that the ATPase activity was not enhanced by addition of 2 mm CHAPS, indicating that Pgp is inserted into the liposomes in an inside-out configuration. As observed previously (34Urbatsch I.L. Julien M. Carrier I. Rousseau M.E. Cayrol R. Gros P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14138-14149Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), E552Q and E1197Q showed neither basal ATPase activity nor drug-stimulated ATPase activity. Hoechst 33342 has been shown to be a substrate of Pgp (48Chen A.Y., Yu, C. Bodley A. Peng L.F. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1332-1337PubMed Google Scholar). It is particularly useful in transport measurements because it is highly fluorescent when bound to lipid membranes, but virtually non-fluorescent in aqueous solution (6Shapiro A.B. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16167-16175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Consequently, the transport function of reconstituted WT Pgp was assayed by measuring the variation of Hoechst 33342 fluorescence as a function of time. In the presence of MgATP, the Hoechst 33342 fluorescence decreased rapidly, whereas no significant change was observed in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog MgATPγS (Fig. 1). These observations demonstrate the ATP-dependent transport of Hoechst 33342 by reconstituted Pgp. The spectra of WT Pgp and mutants E552Q and E1197Q reconstituted into lipids were recorded in the absence and presence of nucleotides (MgATP, MgATPγS, and MgATP/Vi). The IR spectrum of WT Pgp alone in the 1800 to 1400 cm−1 region is shown in Fig.2. The amide I band, assigned to ν(C=O) of the peptide bond, is located in the 1700 to 1600 cm−1 region. The 1570 to 1500 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1 bands represent unexchanged amide II, characteristic of the δ(N–H) amide bond, and exchanged amide II, characteristic of the δ(N–D) amide bond, respectively. The lipid ester ν(C=O) band is located in the 1700–1800 cm−1region. The secondary structures of WT and mutant Pgp were determined by Fourier deconvolution and curve fitting analysis of the amide I region of a deuterated sample. The secondary structure of WT Pgp was estimated to 46% α-helices, 18% β-sheets, 8% β-turns, and 28% random structures (Table I). It also clearly appears that the shape of the amide I band (and consequently, the secondary structure of Pgp) was not significantly modified by the point mutations. The secondary structures of WT and mutant Pgp remained unchanged in the presence of nucleotides, demonstrating that Pgp does not undergo secondary structure change during the hydrolysis process.Table ISecondary structures of WT and mutant Pgpsα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnRandom%%%%WT46 ± 318 ± 38 ± 328 ± 3E552Q47 ± 319 ± 37 ± 327 ± 3E1197Q47 ± 320 ± 37 ± 326 ± 3The percentages were obtained by analysis of the shape of the amide I band according to Goormaghtigh et al.

Open table in a new tab The percentages were obtained by analysis of the shape of the amide I band according to Goormaghtigh et al. (42Goormaghtigh E. Cabiaux V. Ruysschaert J.-M. Subcell. Biochem. 1994; 23: 405-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). As amide II (located between 1570 and 1500 cm−1) arises predominantly from the peptide N–H bending, the rate of amide H exchanged by amide D is related to the solvent accessibility to the N–H amide groups and/or to the stability of secondary structure elements. In consequence, it provides sensitive information about the dynamic properties of Pgp. Amide H exchange was followed by monitoring the amide II absorption peak (maximum at 1544 cm−1) as a function of time of exposure to D2O-saturated N2 (Fig. 2). The percentage of exchange was computed between 0 and 100% as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” First, the kinetics of deuteration of WT Pgp were monitored in the presence and absence of different nucleotides (MgATP, MgATPγS, and MgATP/Vi) to observe dynamic changes occurring normally during ATP hydrolysis. MgATPγS, the non-hydrolyzable analog of MgATP, was used to distinguish between ATP binding and hydrolysis. To characterize the conformation of WT Pgp after hydrolysis, the protein was stabilized in its ADP/Pi state by incubation in the presence of Vi (50Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that the exchange rate of WT Pgp was modified by the presence of nucleotides. In the absence of ligand, ∼55% of amide H of Pgp exchanged for amide D after 30 min. In the presence of ATPγS, the exchange rate measured after 30 min was not modified. However, the H/D exchange occurred faster. In the presence of ATP/Vi, the exchange rate drastically increased, as ∼75% of amide H was exchanged after 30 min. In the presence of ATP, the exchange rate also increased, but in a less important manner: ∼60% of Pgp amide H was exchanged after 30 min. Second, H/D exchange kinetics were used to investigate the effect of point mutations E552Q and E1197Q on the global dynamic state of Pgp and the dynamic chan"

To improve the understanding of glutaredoxin function, a null mutant for grxB (grxB−) was constructed and combined with other mutations. Null mutants for grxB or all three glutaredoxin genes were viable in rich and minimal media with little changes in their growth properties. Expression of leaderless alkaline phosphatase showed that Grx1 and Grx2 (but not Grx3) contributed in the reduction of cytosolic protein disulfides. Moreover, Grx1 could catalyze disulfide formation in the oxidizing cytosol of combined null mutants for glutathione reductase and thioredoxin 1. grxB− cells were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants and showed increased carbonylation of intracellular proteins, particularly in the stationary phase. Significant up-regulation of catalase activity was observed in null mutants for thioredoxin 1 and the three glutaredoxins, whereas up-regulation of glutaredoxin activity was observed in catalase-deficient strains with additional defects in the thioredoxin pathway. The expression of catalases is thus interconnected with the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin pathways in the antioxidant response.

The expression of catalases is thus interconnected with the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin pathways in the antioxidant response. Glutaredoxins are ubiquitous proteins that catalyze reductions of disulfides (protein-S-S) or mixed disulfides formed between proteins and glutathione (protein-S-SG) in a coupled system with GSH, NADPH, and glutathione reductase (1.Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxins can thus be envisaged as reductants of disulfides via GSH. To perform their redox reactions, glutaredoxins have evolved two catalytic mechanisms. The dithiol mechanism uses the two adjacent Cys residues of the active site (usually CPYC) to reduce protein-S-S or protein-S-SG substrates (2.Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The alternative monothiol mechanism (usual active site CGFS) can only reduce protein-S-SG substrates (2.Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A good in vitro substrate for glutaredoxin activity is the mixed disulfide composed of GSH and mercaptoethanol. This molecule forms spontaneously when β-hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED 1The abbreviations used are: HEDβ-hydroxyethyl disulfideAPalkaline phosphatase Δ2–22gorgene encoding glutathione reductaseGrxglutaredoxingrxBgene encoding glutaredoxin 2KankanamycinPAPS3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfateTctetracyclin resistanceTntransposonTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseRR1aclass 1a ribonucleotide reductaseHPI and HPIIcatalase I and catalase II 1The abbreviations used are: HEDβ-hydroxyethyl disulfideAPalkaline phosphatase Δ2–22gorgene encoding glutathione reductaseGrxglutaredoxingrxBgene encoding glutaredoxin 2KankanamycinPAPS3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfateTctetracyclin resistanceTntransposonTrxthioredoxinTrxRthioredoxin reductaseRR1aclass 1a ribonucleotide reductaseHPI and HPIIcatalase I and catalase II or di-mercaptoethanol) and GSH are mixed and is a good substrate for both monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins (HED assay) (1.Holmgren A.

Yeast, for example, contains five different glutaredoxins (3.Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), whereas the other three have a monothiol active site (CGFS) (4.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although all yeast glutaredoxins play a role in their response against oxidative stress (3.Luikenhuis S.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Null mutants for yGrx2 and -5 or yGrx3, -4, and -5 are not viable, suggesting that a specific minimal monothiol glutaredoxin is essential for yeast survival (4.Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Cabiscol E. Sorribas A. Herrero E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8180-8190Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli has three glutaredoxins (5.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A.

The first glutaredoxin (Grx1; 9 kDa, encoded by grxA) was discovered as a glutathione-dependent hydrogen donor for E. coli class 1a ribonucleotide reductase (RR1a) in mutants lacking Trx1 (7.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other two glutaredoxins, Grx2 (encoded by grxB) and Grx3 (9 kDa, encoded by grxC) were purified from an E. coli null mutant for Grx1 and Trx1 (5.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C.

Grx1 and Grx3 have 33% sequence identity and similar structures (thioredoxin/glutaredoxin fold) (8.Bushweller J.H. Billeter M. Holmgren A. Wüthrich K. J. Mol.

Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Grx3 can reduce RR1a with 5% catalytic efficiency of Grx1, whereas Grx2 cannot reduce RR1a at all (5.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Grx2 and Grx3 do not seem to participate in the reduction of sulfate (SO42−) to sulfite (SO32−), which is catalyzed in E. coli by the enzyme 3′-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) reductase (1.Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Trx1, Trx2, and Grx1 can reduce the intramolecular disulfide of PAPS reductase in vitro, whereas Grx2 and Grx3 cannot (13.Lillig C.H. Prior A. Schwenn J.D. Åslund F. Ritz D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7695-7698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using HED as a substrate, Grx3 and especially Grx2 have higher catalytic activities in vitro compared with Grx1 (10.Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the case of the mixed disulfide of arsenate reductase with glutathione as a substrate (14.Shi J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36039-36042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), Grx2 is a 100-fold more active than any of the other two glutaredoxins. Arsenate reductase catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite (14.Shi J. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Grx2 is thus very good in reducing mixed disulfides between a protein thiol and GSSG and is an abundant protein (5.Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and yet its biological function is still largely unknown. To elucidate more functions of the E. coliglutaredoxins, we constructed E. coli null mutants for the Grx2 gene (grxB) as well as different combinations of other genes of the glutaredoxin/thioredoxin pathways and characterized their properties. β-Hydroxyethyl disulfide was from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. NADPH and glutathione reductase (yeast) was from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Amersham Biosciences Inc. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq polymerase were from Promega. M9 media were supplemented with 50 μg/ml Leu-Ile and 1× basal medium Eagle's vitamin solution (Invitrogen). XL-1 blue and DH5α were used for plasmid propagation and cloning purposes.

Sterile porous discs (AB Biodisc) were placed on top of the top agar, and 5 μl of stress compound was pipetted on the discs. The oxidants used were cumene hydroperoxide (1.5%), diamide (250 mm), hydrogen peroxide (0.2%), and menadione (580 mm). Inhibition of growth was measured after 16–24 h at 37 °C as the diameter of the disc of clear cells around the oxidant. Every plate contained four different oxidants, and average values for inhibition zones were calculated from three different plates. In the measurement of total glutaredoxin activity in cell-free lysates from different mutants, total protein was measured in supernatants prepared as described (10.Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) after sonication and centrifugation using the Bradford protein assay (15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 141: 515-522Google Scholar). In the estimation of carbonylation content, total protein was measured using intact cells (no sonication) by the method of Peterson (16.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7066) Google Scholar). The E. coli gene for Grx2 (grxB) was deleted using a constructed recombinant λ233 phage from the Kohara library in which the Grx2 coding sequence was replaced by a kanamycin resistance cassette (17.Kulakauskas S. Wikström P.M. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At a first stage, a 1.2-kb fragment flanking upstream grxB was amplified using primers gBdel F3 (5′-CCT GCT CAT CGA ATT CAT GCT GG TC-3′) and gBdel RC1 (5′-GAT CGT AAA TGT AAA GCT TCA CGT-3′), and a 1.2-kb downstream flanking region was amplified using primers gBdel F2 (5′-ACG TGA AGC TTT ACA TTT ACG ATC TGT TAT CAT CAA TGG CGA TTT AAT CC-3′) and gBdel RC3 (5′-GGT CAT CAA TGG AAT TCA ATC GTG C-3′. pGEM-3Z (Promega) containing a 4.2-kb chromosomal fragment with grxB (10.Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11236-11243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The two different 1.2-kb fragments were purified on an agarose gel and were used as templates for primers gBdelF3 and gBdelRC3. The resulting 2.4-kb fragment (1.2-tr grxB-B1.2), which contained a reading frame encoding three amino acids in the place of grxB, had a HindIII site in the middle and one EcoRI site at each end. The fragment was digested with EcoRI and was cloned in vector pGEM-3Z in which the BamHI site had been previously eliminated after cutting by BamHI and then filling and religating. The new vector (pGEM-3Z-1.2-tr grxB-1.2) was digested with BamHI, the sticky ends were filled with T4 DNA polymerase, and the 1.4-kb kanamycin resistance cassette from vector pUC-4K (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) was ligated after it had been previously excised with PstI and filled in with T4 DNA polymerase. The new plasmid (pGEM-3Z-1.2-Kan-1.2) was used to transform strain MC1061, and the grxB::Kan deletion was transferred to λ phage 233 according to a described method (17.Kulakauskas S. Wikström P.M. Berg D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which resulted in the formation of MC1061 grxB::Kan. The absence of grxB in MC1061 was confirmed by Southern blot of total chromosomal DNA using amplified grxB as a probe. The grxB::Kan genotype was transferred to DHB4 and derivatives by P1 transduction (18.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). As some of DHB4 derivatives also contained Kan resistance cassettes, Tn 10 (19) was placed close to the grxB::Kan mutation to create grxB::Kan … Tc. P1 lysogens from this genotype were used to transduce DHB4 derivatives selecting for Tc resistance. All Tc resistance transductants from this procedure were screened by PCR to confirm the presence of the grxB::Kan genotype using internal primers for the Kan gene and primers located upstream/downstream grxB. Strains DHB4 and UM1 (19.Kleckner N. Bender J. Gottesman S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 139-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) were used to make combinations of different null mutants by P1 transduction (18.Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The gene encoding Grx2 was amplified using primers G2FNde (′5-TGG AGG AGT CAT ATG AAG CTA TAC-3′) and G2EcoRC1 (5′-CGC GGC GGG GAA TTC TTA AAT CGC-3′) to obtain a PCR product encoding wild type Grx2. Primers G2-C12S (5′-ATG AAG CTA TAC ATT TAC GAT CAC TGC CCT TAC AGC CTC AAA GC-3′), and G2EcoRC1 gave a primary PCR product to be used as a template for primers G2Fnde and G2EcoRC1, finally giving the Grx2C12S mutant gene. C9S/C12S (5′-ATG AAG CTA TAC ATT TAC GAT CAC AGC CCT TAC AGC CTC AAA GC-3′) and G2EcoRC1 gave the template amplified later with G2Fnde and G2EcoRC1 to give the PCR product encoding Grx2 C9S/C12S. pGEM-3Z (Promega) containing a 4.2-kb chromosomal fragment with grxB (10.Vlamis-Gardikas A.

All PCR products were digested by EcoRI-NdeI and ligated to vector pISC1 containing an arabinose-induced promoter (21.Huang D.S. Thöny B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2209-2213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strain gor−grxA−B−C−was transformed with the resulting vectors, plated on LB plates supplemented with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml, and grown overnight at 37 °C. Isolated colonies were streaked on M9 plates supplied with Leu-Ile-Met, 50 μg/ml, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown for 2 days. To examine the effect of the Grx2 mutants on cell viability, transformed strains were streaked on M9 plates supplemented with Leu-Ile, ampicillin, and 0.1% arabinose (no reduced sulfur present). Growth of the strains on these plates after 2 days at 37 °C was taken as evidence that the strains could grow on M9 minimal medium. A fresh mixture of 1 mm GSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6 μg/ml yeast glutathione reductase was prepared in 100 mm Tris-Cl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 (1.Holmgren A. Åslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To 500 μl of this mixture in semi-micro cuvettes, HED was added to a final concentration of 0.7 mm. After 3 min, supernatant of total cell lysate of different knockouts was added to the sample cuvettes, and the decrease in A340 was recorded the following 5 min using a Zeiss PMQ3 spectrophotometer. Activity was expressed as milli-ΔA340 OD units/min. Most measurements were performed in a final volume of 100 μl using a Molecular Devices Thermomax microplate reader. Values of ΔA340were then multiplied by a factor of 4.3 to give the ΔA340 of a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. All activity measurements were made at 25 °C. DHB4 strain and derivatives transformed with plasmid pAID135 encoding leaderless alkaline phosphatase (AP) (22.Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) were grown to early log phase (A600 = 0.3–0.5) in M63 minimal medium containing 0.2% glucose, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml of all amino acids apart from cysteine and methionine (unless methionine was supplied to 50 μg/ml). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm final concentration, and cells were grown further for 1 h. The culture was then harvested, and the total AP activity of cell extracts was estimated as described previously (21.Huang D.S. Thöny B. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2209-2213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in LB and exposed to H2O2 at their exponential phase of growth (A600 = 0.4–0.6) or at stationary phase (overnight cultures). One ml of cells was placed in an Eppendorf tube and exposed to H2O2 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then harvested, resuspended in water, and kept at −80 °C. Cells were later lysed in SDS and derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (23.Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar) for 30 min. After neutralization, samples were electrophoresed in 12.5% acrylamide and Western blotted using as primary antibody a 1:1000 dilution of an antibody raised to 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DAKO). The blots were processed further with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and finally developed with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence kit (exponential phase of growth). For cells in the stationary phase of growth, the secondary antibody was an alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Contrast was adjusted in each final picture with the help of identical samples run as internal standards for each of the two blots. The total amount of protein per well was 1.25 μg for the exponential phase experiments and 2.5 μg for the stationary phase. These assays were performed in bacterial extracts following the production of oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, using an oxygen electrode. Cells were grown in M9 medium and harvested by centrifugation at different growth stages. Centrifuged cells were washed once with phosphate buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 5 mmEDTA) and stored at −20 °C. To prepare crude extracts, cells were thawed, resuspended in phosphate buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 lb/in2. Cell suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g followed by 60 min at 144,000 ×g. The clear supernatants were decanted and used to assay enzymatic activity. Catalase activity was measured polarographically by following O2 production with a Clark-type oxygen electrode as described previously (23.Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar, 24.Goldberg I. Hochman A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 991: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm H2O2, 100 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3 to determine total HPI and HPII activity or pH 9.3 to determine HPII activity. The activity level of each one of the catalase isozymes was calculated based on their pH optima. At pH 6.3 both enzymes are at their maximal activity, whereas at pH 9.3, HPII is maximally active and HPI is only at 10%. The reaction was run at 30 °C for 1 min using only the initial linear rates to calculate catalase activity. One unit of enzyme activity corresponded to the decomposition of 1 μmol of H2O2/min at an initial concentration of 20 mm H2O2. To generate a null mutant for grxB, the Grx2 coding sequence was replaced by a Kan resistance cassette, and the absence of grxB in the viable MC1061 strain was confirmed by Southern blotting. The grxB::Kan genotype was further transferred to other strains and combined with other known mutations to create a series of mutants (Table I). Strain DHB4 was generally used as the genetic background to generate null mutants for Grx2 and the other glutaredoxins. This strain has been used extensively previously to assess conditions affecting the folding of AP in the cytosol (22.Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol.

Strains CSH7 and UM1 were also used to compare sensitivity to different oxidants. To examine the importance of Grx2 for the growth of E. coli, we compared the growth rates of different null mutants in rich and minimal media. The wild type and strains grxB−trxA−grxA−, trxA−grxB−, grxA−B−C−, gor−, gor−trxA−, gor−trxA−grxB−, gor−grxA−B−C−, trxB−, trxB−grxB−, trxB−grxC−, trxB−grxB−C−, and gor−trxB− all had very similar growth rates in the rich LB medium (not shown), suggesting that E. coli can compensate for major perturbations of the thioredoxin/glutaredoxin pathways when supplied fully with nutrients. In M9 minimal medium, the wild type and null mutants for grxB, trxAgrxB, grxABC, gor, gorgrxB, trxB, trxBgrxB, trxBgrxBC, and trxBgrxC grew also at similar rates. However strains trxA−grxC−, gor−trxA−, and gor−trxA−grxB−grew very slowly and reached lower final levels of growth (Fig. 1) in M9. A possible explanation is that lack of Trx1 combined with partial neutralization of the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway reduced the ability of cells to utilize sulfate. For example, trxAgrxA cells cannot grow at all in minimal media as they cannot reduce SO42− to SO32− (12.Russel M. Model P. Holmgren A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1923-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Null mutants for gorgrxABC could barely grow on solid minimal"

In rat and rabbit, α1C has two N-terminal (NT) isoforms, long and short, with variable initial segments of 46 and 16 amino acids, respectively. The initial 46 amino acids of the long-NT α1C are crucial for PKC regulation. However, only a short-NT human α1C is known. We assumed that a long-NT isoform of human α1C may exist. By homology screening of human genomic DNA, we identified a stretch (termed exon 1a) highly homologous to rabbit long-NT, separated from the next known exon of α1C (exon 1b, which encodes the alternative, short-NT) by an ∼80 kb-long intron. The predicted 46-amino acid protein sequence is highly homologous to rabbit long-NT. Reverse transcriptase PCR showed the presence of exon 1a transcript in human cardiac RNA.

However, expression of human L-type channels, encoded by all cDNA cloned to date, yielded Ca2+ channels that were only inhibited by PKC; the enhancement could not be reconstituted (15Bouron A.

The reason for the inability to reproduce the PKC modulation of human L-type channels remained unknown. The main, pore-forming subunit of cardiac/smooth muscle L-type channel (α1C or Cav1.2), also present in the brain, is the product of the α1C gene, CACNA1C(16Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M.

In the two best studied mammalian species, rat and rabbit, two N-terminal isoforms of α1C cDNA are known, which most probably represent variable splicing products of the same gene (23Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These splice variants encode long- and short-NT α1C proteins, with variable initial segments of 46 and 16 aa, respectively (23Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 24Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S.

Traditionally, the short-NT isoform is called “neuronal” in rat and “smooth muscle” in rabbit, whereas the long-NT isoform is considered “cardiac” in rabbit. However, in rat, α1C protein containing the long-NT is found in both heart and brain (27Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The known human α1C is highly homologous to short-NT isoforms of rat and rabbit; the long-NT isoforms of rat and rabbit are also highly homologous to each other. Because the human L-type channel is up-regulated by PKC, and because the initial 20 aa of the long-NT isoform are crucial for this regulation in rabbit α1C (27Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H.

Here we demonstrate the presence of an exon encoding the initial 46-aa long-NT segment in the human genomic DNA. The existence of α1C RNA containing this segment was confirmed by RT-PCR gel analysis and DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR product. Using the RT-PCR products, we have demonstrated that cDNA coding for a full-length long-NT α1C isoform expressed in Xenopusoocytes produces a Ca2+ channel that is enhanced by a PKC activator. The identification of the long-NT isoform of human α1C will enable the study of the molecular mechanisms of PKC modulation, which has previously been hampered by the inability to reconstitute this modulation in expression systems. All experiments with human and animal tissues were approved by the Tel Aviv University Helsinki Committee and the Sackler School of Medicine Animal Use Committee, respectively. Rat atria and ventricles were obtained from 19-day-old Wistar rats after decapitation performed under ether anesthesia.Xenopus frogs were maintained and operated on, and oocytes were prepared as described (29Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Each oocyte was injected with 2.5 ng of RNAs of α1C, α2/δ, and β2A subunits and incubated for 3–4 days at 20–22 °C in NDE96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). 5 μg of total human cardiac RNA purchased from Ambion, Inc. (catalog no. 7966, lot 110P43B) was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with primer 3 (see text below and Fig.2A). Each PCR reaction (50 μl) contained 2.4 μl of the product of RT reaction, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTPs, 20–50 pmol of primers, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 2 μl of Mg2+ (2 mm), and 0.7 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR was performed under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 49 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, repeated 35 times. The final elongation was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. The primers used for RT and PCR were: No. 1, CTTCGAGCCTTTGTTCAG (nt 4–21 from A in ATG of exon 1a); No. 2, TCAATGAGAATACGAGGA (nt 5–22 in exon 1b; numbering from ATG of the short-NT isoform α1C,77 (17Soldatov N.M.

Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). cDNA of human short-NT isoform α1C,77 (Ref. 31Soldatov N.M. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10540-10543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession No.Z34815) was obtained from Dr. R. Zuhlke and subcloned into pGEM-HJ vector (which contains 5′- and 3′-UTRs of Xenopusα-globin flanking the polylinker). In the resulting construct, termed α1C,77S, the 5′-UTR of α-globin is followed by aBamHI restriction site and then immediately by the initial ATG. The coding sequence of α1C,77 is followed by the 3′-UTR of α-globin and then by a SalI site. The DNA of the long-NT, termed α1C,77L, was constructed as follows. The human heart cDNA obtained in the RT reaction described above was subjected to PCR with the reverse primer No. 3 (see above) and a forward primer ATTCGCGGATCCATGCTTCGAGCCTTTGTT that overlaps the first 18 nt of the coding part of exon 1a (starting with ATG) and also creates a BamHI restriction site preceding ATG. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and MfeI (a unique MfeI site is present in exon 3 upstream of primer No. 3) and inserted between these restriction sites intoBamHI/MfeI-digested α1C,77S in place of the original DNA segment flanked by these sites. The 5′ portion of the resulting DNA was sequenced. The sequence of theBamHI-MfeI segment obtained by this RT-PCR subcloning procedure was 100% identical to that predicted for the long-NT splice variant (based on the DNA sequence of chromosome 12), in which exon 1a is followed by exons 2 and 3 (see Fig.1C). RNA was synthesized as described (29Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Protocols in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded using the Gene Clamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique, as described (30Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), in a solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mm NaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid. PMA and bisindolylmaleimide (BIS) were purchased from Sigma. Oocytes were treated with BIS essentially as described (32Sharon D. Vorobiov D. Dascal N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 477-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In brief, the oocyte was injected with 30 nl of a water solution of BIS at 150 μm and, in addition, incubated in 5 μm BIS 2–4 h before recording. Stimulation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments). The initial exon of the previously described (17Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) human α1C clone, which we now designate exon 1b, contains a 5′-UTR and encodes the first 16 aa of the short-NT α1Cprotein. To find out whether DNA sequences that encode an alternative, long-NT isoform of human α1C exist, we performed a standard BLAST search of human genomic DNA, 2Found on the Web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. using as our query the cDNA sequence encoding the first 46 aa of the rabbit cardiac long-NT clone (24Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The initial search showed the presence of a highly homologous sequence in the contig 3810573 3NCBI accession number AC005342. from human chromosome 12, locus p13.3 (Fig.1A; the region of the initial search is highlighted by bold letters). This is within the region where the gene of α1C, CACNA1C, is located. Significantly, the sequence upstream from this segment showed significant homology to the 5′-UTR of the rabbit α1C(Fig. 1A), supporting the possibility that it may be part of an initial exon of a human L-type channel. We have designated this tentative exon as 1a. Within the presumably protein-coding part of exon 1a, a 45-base-long DNA segment, starting at base 16 (from the initial ATG) also shares 40% homology with the protein-coding part of exon 1b (Fig. 1A). The availability of the draft sequence of the human chromosome 12 on the NCBI Human Genome site allowed us to map the location of the putative exon 1a relative to the known exons of the human α1C gene (Fig. 1B). Exon 1a precedes exon 1b and is separated from the latter by ∼80 kb. We assume that this is a large intron. Two other large introns are found, according to the draft map of the chromosome, between exon 1b and exon 2 (∼60 kb) and between exons 3 and 4 (∼330 kb). These large introns have not been fully sequenced previously; introns of >5 and 2.4 kb have been reported (17Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The location of exon 1a supports the possibility that it constitutes the first alternative exon of the CACNA1C gene. The screening procedure also confirmed the presence and the correct spatial location on chromosome 12 of all the of constant and alternative exons described by Soldatov in 1994 (17Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig.1B show 10 of the 50 exons, excluding exon 1a). Our working hypothesis was that exons 1a and 1b are alternative initial exons of the human CACNA1C gene (Fig. 1C). Exons 2 and 3 are probably constant (17Soldatov N.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), as supported by the conservation of the corresponding protein sequences in known long- and short-NT α1C isoforms in human, rat, rabbit, and mouse (Fig.1D and Refs. 23Snutch T.P.

The protein sequences of N termini of the proposed human α1C short- and long-NT isoforms are shown in Fig. 1D and are compared with the rabbit long-NT α1C. The segment corresponding to exon 2 starts after aa 46 in the long-NT isoform and after aa 16 in the short-NT isoform. The protein segment encoded by exon 3 starts at aa 155, exactly at the proposed junction between the cytosolic NT and the first transmembrane segment of the channel, IS1 (24Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To further substantiate our working hypothesis, we performed RT-PCR on total human cardiac RNA. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using primer No. 3 (Fig. 2A), which corresponds to the 3′ end of exon 3. The analytical PCR was done with primers corresponding to segments of chromosome 12 DNA, as published at the NCBI Human Genome site, within the putative exons and introns of the 5′ region of CACNA1C. The location of primers is shown in Fig. 2A. Clear bands were detected for all DNAs that contained exon 1a (Fig. 2B): protein-coding sequences of [exon 1a + exon 2 + exon 3] (lane 1) and [exon 1a + exon 2] (lane 3); [exon 1a including 5′UTR + exon 2] (lane 5). The sizes of the DNAs corresponded to those expected for an RNA transcript that contains exons 1a, 2, and 3without 1b. Control reactions, with primers within the presumed intron regions (lanes 6 and 7) and ∼1.4–2.4 kb upstream from the beginning of exon 1a (lane 8) did not yield signals. Another cDNA segment that included protein-coding sequences of exon 1a, 2, and (part of) 3 was obtained for subcloning purposes (see “Experimental Procedures”) and sequenced. The size and the DNA sequence of this RT-PCR product were exactly as expected for [exon 1a + exon 2 + exon 3 up toMfeI site] without exon 1b and encoded the first 46 aa of the proposed long-NT isoform of α1C followed by protein sequences highly conserved in all known isoforms of α1C. These results strongly support the presence in human cardiac tissue of an RNA species encoding the proposed long-NT isoform shown in Fig. 1, C and D. A band corresponding to the DNA of exons [1b + 2 + 3] was also obtained; the size was exactly as expected for a short-NT isoform,without 1a (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Under standard conditions the band corresponding to [exon 1b +exon 2] was not detected (Fig. 2B, lane 4), but varying the conditions of PCR revealed this band, although it still remained relatively weak (Fig. 2C). Thus, RNA of the previously described short-NT isoform is also present in human cardiac tissue. Previously, the existence of a long-NT α1C protein in rat has been demonstrated by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody directed against the unique initial 46 aa of the rabbit long-NT isoform (27Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The same antibody detected a >220 kDa protein (presumably the L-type Ca2+ channel) in a human colon cancer cell line (33Wang X.T. Nagaba Y. Cross H.S. Wrba F. Zhang L. Guggino S.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1549-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results corroborate the presence of the long-NT α1C protein in human tissues. Taken together, our data and those of Ref. 33Wang X.T. Nagaba Y. Cross H.S. Wrba F. Zhang L. Guggino S.E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1549-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar support the notion that human cardiac (and probably other) tissues contain two N-terminal isoforms of α1C protein, a long-NT and a short-NT one, which are products of alternatively spliced RNA transcripts of the 5′-terminal region of the CACNA1C gene (as shown in Fig. 1, Cand D). According to our initial hypothesis, the long-NT α1Cshould be up-regulated by the activation of PKC. To test this prediction, we constructed a cDNA encoding a long-NT α1C on the basis of a human short-NT α1CDNA, α1C,77 (19Soldatov N.M. Zuhlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3560-3566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Both cDNAs were subcloned into the pGEM-HJ vector and verified by DNA sequencing (see “Experimental Procedures”). The long-NT clone was designated α1C,77Land the short-NT clone α1C,77S. The corresponding RNAs were synthesized in vitro and injected intoXenopus oocytes with RNA of the α2/δ subunit with or without RNA of the β2A subunit (30Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). The voltage-dependent Ba2+ currents (IBa) via the expressed α1C,77L and α1C,77S Ca2+ channels ranged from 100 to 800 nA without β2A and from 1500 to 7000 nA with β2A. The kinetics of IBa of α1C,77L and α1C,77S(e.g. Fig. 3C) were very similar to each other and to those directed by rabbit cardiac α1C. The other parameters also resembled those previously reported for L-type Ca2+ channels of various species. For instance, as described previously for the rabbit α1C (30Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar,34Perez Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), coexpression of the β2A subunit increased the current amplitude 9.5 ± 0.4-fold in α1C,77L and 9.3 ± 0.6-fold in α1C,77S, and shifted the voltage dependence of activation to more negative potentials, as shown by normalized current-voltage curves (Fig. 3A). Peak IBa was similar in the long-NT and short-NT isoforms; the small difference was statistically significant (Fig. 3B), but at present we do not know whether this reflects differences in protein expression or in the gating properties of the two isoforms. The prediction that the long-NT human α1C should be enhanced by PKC has been fully confirmed. The main effect of the phorbol ester β-PMA (a PKC activator) was to increase the Ba2+ current of α1C,77L coexpressed with α2/δ with or without β2A (Fig. 3, C–E). As in the rabbit α1C channel (13Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the increase reached a maximum within 5–8 min and was followed by a decrease, sometimes below the basal current level (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the short-NT α1C,77S channels were inhibited by PMA (Fig.3D), in line with the previous report (15Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). On average, PMA increased the current via the long-NT channels by 22.7 ± 4.4% in the absence of β2A subunit and by 21.2 ± 4.2% in its presence (Fig. 3E). The PMA-induced increase in IBa was fully blocked by the specific PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (Fig.3E; bar marked BIS), supporting the notion that the enhancement of IBa by PMA was indeed mediated by PKC. Thus, in general, the modulation of the human long-NT isoform by PKC is similar to that of the rabbit cardiac channel. With rabbit cardiac L-type channel, coexpression of β2A substantially weakens the enhancement of the current by PMA (13Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas in the human channel this action of β2A is less pronounced. It would be of interest to see whether this is due to one of the few differences in the primary amino acid composition of the 46-aa-long initial NT segment in human and rabbit (Fig. 1D, underlined amino acids). In a different expression system (human embryonic kidney cell line tsA-201), only inhibition of the rabbit long-NT α1C by PMA has been observed (35McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The inhibition crucially depended on the presence of each of the two threonines, Thr27 and Thr31 (shown in bold in Fig. 1D), in which phosphorylation by PKC was proposed to underlie this modulation. It has been proposed that the lack of PKC-induced enhancement in tsA-201 cells may result from the absence of a specific PKC isozyme (35McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). At present, we do not know whether the phosphorylation of Thr31 (Thr27 is absent in the long-NT human α1C; Fig. 1D) plays a role in any of the PKC effects observed in Xenopus oocytes. We suspect that the mechanism of PMA-induced inhibition of α1C in oocytes is different from that observed in tsA-201 cells, because a short-NT isoform of rat α1C was not sensitive to PMA in this system (35McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), whereas the homologous short-NT human α1C is inhibited by PKC in Xenopus oocytes (Ref. 15Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Furthermore, the decrease of IBa is still observed in the presence of BIS (Fig. 3E), whereas in tsA-201 cells PKC inhibitors blocked the effect of PMA (35McHugh D. Sharp E.M. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12334-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The PMA-induced inhibition of human L-type Ca2+ channels observed inXenopus oocytes requires further study. Because the most widely observed effect of PKC activators on human L-type Ca2+ channels is an enhancement of the current (sometimes accompanied by an inhibition (5Schuhmann K. Groschner K.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H670-H676PubMed Google Scholar)), and because this regulation is reproduced with the long-NT α1C inXenopus oocytes, we propose that the long-NT α1C is the isoform that underlies the PKC-induced enhancement. The homologous long-NT rabbit α1C isoform behaves in the same way when expressed in oocytes (13Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 28Shistik E. Ivanina T. Blumenstein Y. Dascal N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17901-17909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), probably by means of an identical molecular mechanism as in human α1C. The four aa following the initial methionine in rabbit long-NT α1C, LRAL, are necessary for PKC-induced enhancement. Because this protein segment contains no putative phosphorylation sites, we have proposed that PKC phosphorylation occurs elsewhere in α1C or in an auxiliary protein, whereas the first five aa play a role in PKC anchoring or in channel gating (27Shistik E. Keren-Raifman T. Idelson G.H. Dascal N. Ivanina T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31145-31149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The short-NT isoform lacks these four amino acids; its initial 15-aa segment (following the first methionine) carries a partial homology to amino acids 6–20 of the long-NT isoform (Fig. 1D). In rabbit long-NT α1C, the first 20 aa play the role of the inhibitory gating element, which reduces the open probability of the L-type channel 4N. Kanevsky and N. Dascal, unpublished observations.

It would be of great interest to see whether this is also the case in human long-NT α1C. We hope that the discovery of the long-NT isoform of human α1C and the demonstration of its modulation by PKC, as described in this report, will provide the basis and the incentive for future studies of PKC targets (α1Cor an auxiliary protein?) and of the interaction between the phosphorylated and gating parts of α1C in PKC modulation.

Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8111) Google Scholar). The unique lipid raft environment favors the partitioning of proteins carrying saturated acyl chains, such as myristate and palmitate, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkages (10Melkonian K.A.

Indeed, the first 10 amino acids of Lck containing the dual acylation site is sufficient for targeting cytosolic proteins to lipid rafts, indicating that this short motif is a lipid raft-targeting signal (12Bi K.

Certain palmitoylated proteins are found constitutively enriched within lipid rafts in T cells such as Lck and the transmembrane adaptor protein LAT, although a significant portion of Lck remains excluded from rafts (5Kabouridis P.S.

Upon TCR cross-linking, non-lipid-modified proteins such as the ζ chain of the TCR and the cytoplasmic proteins ZAP-70, phospholipase C-γ, Vav, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SLP-76 are recruited to lipid rafts (15Zhang W.

One potential binding protein for the Lck SH3 domain is c-Cbl. The proto-oncogene product c-Cbl is a multifunctional protein that binds to numerous signaling molecules and participates in a number of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (37Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 38Lupher M.L., Jr. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol.

Signal. 1998; 10: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). c-Cbl is a 120-kDa protein that consists of several domains including a proline-rich C-terminal region that binds constitutively to the SH3 domains of several members of Src family kinases. Biochemical and genetic analyses have indicated that c-Cbl negatively regulates tyrosine kinases, including the Src family kinases, in part by promoting their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. c-Cbl becomes highly phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation. Additionally, TCR signaling is negatively regulated by c-Cbl as evidenced by inhibition of the induction of the transcription factors AP1 and NFAT upon c-Cbl overexpression (40Rellahan B.L.

Although the palmitoylation of Lck is essential for its localization to lipid rafts, it is not clear whether protein-protein interactions also contribute to the regulation of Lck localization. We have examined the role of the Lck binding domains in its localization by expressing domain-inactive mutants of Lck in J.CaM1 T cells. The Lck SH3 domain-inactive mutant was preferentially localized to lipid rafts and incorporated more of the radioiodinated version of palmitic acid, 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid. Furthermore, the localization of Lck to lipid rafts was diminished in c-Cbl overexpressing Jurkat cells and was enhanced in c-Cbl knockout T cells. Lck binding to c-Cbl in vivo was inhibited by inactivation of the Lck SH3 domain. Our results suggest that the interaction of c-Cbl with the SH3 domain of Lck is important for regulation of the basal localization of Lck to lipid rafts. The human leukemia T cell line Jurkat (clone E6.1) and the Lck-deficient mutant of Jurkat (J.CaM1) were from American Type Culture Collection. c-Cbl-deficient (206−/−) and the corresponding c-Cbl-expressing (230+/+) murine T cell lines (44Andoniou C.E. Lill N.L. Thien C.B. Lupher M.L. Ota S. Bowtell D.D. Scaife R.M. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell.

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The Lyn-deficient DT-40 chicken B cells were grown and maintained as described (49Yankee T.M. Keshvara L.M. Sawasdikosol S. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit was from List Biological Laboratories. The W97ALck mutant was generated from wild type murine Lck using the transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The R154KLck mutant was from Dr. Curt Ashendel (Purdue University, IN). The wild type and mutant Lck cDNA were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS expression construct. The wild type LckGFP in pcDNA3 expression construct has been described (50Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Mutants of LckGFP were generated by subcloning the BstEII fragment of Lck cDNA containing the Lck mutations (W97ALck or R154KLck) from pCAGGS Lck constructs into the corresponding BstEII site in pcDNA3 LckGFP. Human c-Cbl cDNA with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N terminus in pCAGGS was described previously (49Yankee T.M. Keshvara L.M. Sawasdikosol S. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5827-5835PubMed Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and suspended at a concentration of 3 × 107 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (500 μl) were mixed with Lck or HA-c-Cbl expression constructs (2.5 μg) and with 20 μg of pcDNA3 empty vector as a carrier. Cells were electroporated at 800 microfarads/250 V using a Cell-Porator (Invitrogen) and cultured for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640. Transfected cells used for microscopy were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Preparation of lipid rafts was performed as described previously with modifications (15Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Jurkat or J.CaM1 cells (5 × 107) were washed and incubated for 15 min in 1 ml of ice-cold lipid raft lysis buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Lysates were homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, transferred to 5-ml “Ultra-Clear” centrifuge tubes (Beckman Coulter), mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose in MNE buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin), and overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose in MNE followed by 1 ml of 5% sucrose in MNE. After ultracentrifugation for 18 h at 200,000 × g in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor, 12 400-μl fractions were collected starting from the top of the gradient. 100 μl of 5× RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) was added to each of fractions 2 and 3 to solubilize lipid rafts. Where indicated, fractions 2 and 3 containing lipid rafts were combined, and fractions 10 and 11 representing Triton X-100 soluble fractions were combined. Fractions 1–12 or the pooled fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (6–15% gradient gels), transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with the appropriate antibody or with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit (to detect the ganglioside GM1). For lipid raft isolation from 206−/− and 230+/+ cells, normalized protein amounts (5 mg) in Triton X-100 lysates were subjected to sucrose density flotation and processed as described above. Lck protein levels were quantified using a ChemiImager 5500 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). For all fluorescence microscopy experiments, cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and attached to coverslips precoated with polylysine (100 μg/ml) by incubation for 10 min at room temperature at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/coverslip. For fixation, cells were treated with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Lipid raft or GM1 patching was performed as described previously (50Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected J.CaM1 cells (1 × 106) were incubated for 30 min on ice with 100 μl of rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit (CT-B) at 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Lipid raft patching was induced by incubating the cells with anti−CT-B antibody (1:250 in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min on ice and then 15 min at 37 °C. Samples were examined by fluorescence microscopy as described previously (51Ma H. Yankee T.M., Hu, J. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The generation of 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid was performed by radioactive exchange reaction using 16-[127I]iodohexadecanoic acid (provided by Dr. John Cassady, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) and Na125I(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described. 2I. Y. Hawash, X. E. Hu, A. Adal, J. M. Cassady, R. L. Gealen, and M. L. Harrison, submitted for publication. Transfected J.CaM1 cells (1 × 107) were labeled with 0.25 mCi of 16-[125I]iodohexadecanoic acid for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 20 μg/ml each of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were clarified at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of Lck, lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rabbit anti-Lck polyclonal antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with RIPA buffer. Samples were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography. Lck palmitoylation levels were quantified using a ChemiImager 5500 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Transfected J.CaM1 cells were lysed with buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin. Lysates were clarified at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were either directly analyzed by SDS-PAGE (6–15% gradient gels) or subjected to immunoprecipitation. Normalized protein amounts (2 mg) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with polyclonal anti-HA or anti-Lck antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE (6–15% gradient gels), and analyzed by immunoblotting for Lck or HA. Lipid rafts in T cells differentially concentrate signaling proteins. Initially, we tested the distribution of Lck in lipid rafts from resting Jurkat cells. Cells were washed, lysed, and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation to isolate lipid raft and Triton X-100-soluble fractions. Fractions 1–12 were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed to detect Lck, LAT, c-Cbl, and GM1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, we found that lipid rafts were concentrated in Lck, LAT, and the lipid raft marker GM1 and did not contain any detectable c-Cbl, confirming previous results (15Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar,52Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhausl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The partitioning of Lck between lipid raft and Triton X-100-soluble fractions is potentially regulated through posttranslational modifications (e.g. palmitoylation or phosphorylation), protein-protein interactions, or a combination of both. The palmitoylation of Lck is essential for targeting Lck to the plasma membrane (5Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 7Kosugi A. Hayashi F. Liddicoat D.R. Yasuda K. Saitoh S. Hamaoka T. Immunol. Lett. 2001; 76: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but it is unknown whether protein-protein interactions play a role in the regulation of Lck localization within the plasma membrane. We used the Lck-deficient T cell line, J.CaM1, derived from Jurkat cells, to examine the contribution of the Lck SH2 and SH3 domains to the localization of Lck. Constructs encoding the wild type (WT Lck), SH3 domain-inactive (W97ALck) (32Denny M.F. Kaufman H.C. Chan A.C. Straus D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5146-5152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), or SH2 domain-inactive (R154KLck) (53Straus D.B. Chan A.C. Patai B. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) forms of Lck were transiently expressed and analyzed for localization to lipid rafts. As shown in Fig. 1 B, W97ALck was enriched in lipid rafts as compared with WT Lck and R154KLck. To compare further the distribution of Lck variants, we pooled fractions containing lipid rafts (fractions 2 and 3) and fractions representing Triton X-100-soluble lysates (fractions 10 and 11). W97ALck was preferentially localized to lipid rafts as compared with WT Lck and R154KLck (Fig. 1 C, left panel). Densitometric analysis indicated that W97ALck was 2–3-fold enriched in rafts compared with WT Lck and R154KLck. This preferential localization of W97ALck to lipid rafts was accompanied by an ∼2-fold decrease in the amount in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction as compared with WT Lck and R154KLck (Fig. 1 C, middle panel). Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates verified equal expression levels of wild type and mutant Lck (Fig. 1 C, right panel). These results showed that inactivation of the SH3 domain resulted in enhanced Lck partitioning to lipid rafts suggesting that the SH3 domain negatively contributes to the localization of Lck within lipid rafts. In contrast, the SH2 domain does not appear to play a dominant role in this localization. We next investigated the role of the SH3 domain in the subcellular localization of Lck in intact cells. To accomplish this, we generated expression constructs with the cDNA encoding W97ALck and R154KLck fused upstream from the cDNA for green fluorescent protein (GFP). It was demonstrated that GFP fused to the C terminus of Lck (WT LckGFP) does not affect Lck function and subcellular localization (50Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding WT, R154K, or W97A LckGFP were transiently expressed in J.CaM1 cells and examined by fluorescence microscopy. We observed that WT LckGFP and R154KLckGFP localized to the plasma membrane and to intracellular structures reported to be late endocytic vesicles (5Kabouridis P.S. Magee A.I. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4983-4998Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 50Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). W97ALckGFP also localized to the plasma membrane but showed minimal localization to the late endocytic vesicles when compared with WT LckGFP or R154KLckGFP (Fig.2 A, left panel). To verify that the W97ALckGFP subcellular localization was distinct from WT LckGFP, we used the Lyn-deficient DT40 B cell line. As shown in Fig.2 A, right panel, W97ALckGFP exhibited a similar intracellular localization as in J.CaM1 cells. Analysis by confocal microscopy confirmed the above results and showed that both WT LckGFP and W97ALckGFP were not localized inside the nucleus of J.CaM1 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that inactivation of the SH3 domain did not affect the localization of Lck to the plasma membrane but appeared to minimize its localization to late endocytic vesicles. We next compared the extent of colocalization of W97ALckGFP and WT LckGFP with lipid rafts using rhodamine-conjugated cholera toxin B-subunit (CT-B), which binds with high affinity"

We have previously shown that inhibition of farnesyltransferase activity results in an increase in TβR-II expression, leading to enhanced TGF-β binding, signaling, and inhibition of tumor cell growth, suggesting that a farnesylated protein(s) exerts a repressive effect on TβR-II expression. Likely candidates are farnesylated proteins such as Ras and RhoB, which are both farnesylated and involved in cell growth control. Neither a dominant negative Ha-Ras, constitutively activated Ha-Ras, or a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK1 affected TβR-II transcription. However, ectopic expression of RhoB, but not the closely related family member RhoA, resulted in a 5-fold decrease of TβR-II promoter activity. Furthermore, ectopic expression of RhoB, but not RhoA, resulted in a significant decrease of TβR-II protein expression and resistance of tumor cells to TGF-β-mediated cell growth inhibition. Deletion analysis of the TβR-II promoter identified a RhoB-responsive region, and mutational analysis of this region revealed that a site for the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP1) is critical for RhoB-mediated repression of TβR-II transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays clearly showed that the binding of AP1 to its DNA-binding site is strongly inhibited by RhoB. Consequently, transcription assays using an AP1 reporter showed that AP1-mediated transcription is down-regulated by RhoB. Altogether, these results identify a mechanism by which RhoB antagonizes TGF-β action through transcriptional down-regulation of AP1 in TβR-II promoter.

In particular, there is a strong association between TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) inactivation and cancer because many tumors express low levels of TβR-II mRNA and/or protein, and this lack of TβR-II expression correlates with resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β (3Serrero G.

However, there are tumors in which low levels of TβR-II mRNA could not be explained by genetic alterations in the promoter or coding region (10Park K. Kim S.-J. Bang Y.-J. Park J.-G. Kim N.K.

Recently, fusion products from the ets transcription factor gene family and the EWSRI1 gene have been shown to down-regulate transcription of TβR-II, suggesting that inactivation of TβR-II might be important in Ewing sarcoma tumorigenesis (25Hahm K.B.

Overexpression of ERT induced the expression of TβR-II and restored TGF-β signaling in a TGF-β-resistant breast cancer cell line (27Chang J. Lee C. Hahm K.B. Yi Y. Choi S.G. Kim S.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 151-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that an A to G mutation at position −364 in the TβR-II promoter in A431 tumor cells results in reduced TβR-II promoter activity (28Jackson R.J. Antonia S.J. Wright K.L. Moon N.S. Nepveu A. Muñoz-Antonia T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We identified the protein that binds to this site as the transcriptional repressor CDP/Cut (CCAAT displacement protein) and demonstrated that overexpression of CDP/Cut decreases TβR-II transcription (28Jackson R.J. Antonia S.J. Wright K.L. Moon N.S. Nepveu A. Muñoz-Antonia T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Recently, we have shown that inhibition of farnesyltransferase activity increases TβR-II expression, leading to enhanced TGF-β signaling and inhibition of tumor cell growth, which suggested that a farnesylated protein(s) is exerting a repressive effect on TβR-II expression (29Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Chen Z. Ohkanda J. Hamilton A.D. Munoz-Antonia T. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Potential candidates are farnesylated proteins such as the low molecular weight GTPases Ras and RhoB, which are involved in cell growth control. The Ras and Rho small GTPases serve as molecular switches that cycle between GTP-bound (active) and GDP-bound (inactive) states. Ras proteins play an important role in cell proliferation and transformation (30Reuther G.W. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), whereas Rho proteins have been shown to influence a number of cellular processes including motility, adhesion, cell proliferation, metastasis, and transformation (31Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that RhoB antagonizes TGF-β anti-proliferative and transcriptional responses. Moreover, we show that RhoB inhibits TGF-β signaling by down-regulating TβR-II transcription and protein expression. Finally, we show that AP1 is a downstream target of RhoB-mediated inhibition of TGF-β responses.DISCUSSIONResistance to TGF-β anti-proliferative action is believed to be a major contributor to malignant progression, and evidence indicates that TGF-β receptors (TβR-I and TβR-II) and their downstream signaling molecules can act as tumor suppressors (1Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). One major mechanism by which tumors resist TGF-β is a decrease in TGF-β type II receptor expression. In a variety of human tumors, this decrease in TβR-II expression is due to mutations or deletions in the coding region of the TβR-II gene (8Wang D. Song H. Evans J.A. Lang J.C. Schuller D.E. Weghorst C.M. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 2285-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L. Lutteraugh J. Fan R.S. Zborowska E. Kinzler K.W.

However, tumor types such as pancreatic carcinomas do not harbor mutations or deletions in the TβR-II gene but rather express very low levels of receptor (13Fralix K.D. Ahmed M.M. Mattingly C. Swiderski C. McGrath P.C. Venkatasubbarao K. Kamada N. Mohiuddin M. Strodel W.E. Freeman J.W. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2010-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 54Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M.

Turnacioglu K. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5329-5332PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this repression of TβR-II expression occurs is not known. Some studies suggest that the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of TGF-β receptors might involve either c-Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras (45Turco A. Coppa A. Aloe S. Baccheschi G. Morrone S. Zupi G. Colletta G. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 56Game S.M. Huelsen A. Patel V. Donnelly M. Yeudall W.A. Stone A. Fusenig N.E. Prime S.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, these studies relied on125I-TGF-β cross-linking studies and did not determine the actual expression levels of TGF-β receptors. In the present study, we provide evidence using a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, activated Ha-Ras61L, and the dominant negative Ha-RasN17 that the Ras pathway is not involved in the regulation of TβR-II transcription in Panc-1 cells. However, Ras could still be involved in TGF-β resistance by interfering with components of the TGF-β-signaling pathways other than TβR-II. Indeed, Ras has been shown to induce TGF-β resistance by triggering Smad phosphorylation by ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1), resulting in the inability of the Smads to translocate to the nucleus (43Kretzschmar M. Doody J. Timokhina I. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 804-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 57Kretzschmar M. Liu F. Hata A. Doody J. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 58Yue J. Frey R.S. Mulder K.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2033-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The lack of effect of Ras on TβR-II gene expression coupled with our previous finding showing that farnesyl transferase inhibitors enhance TβR-II expression (29Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Chen Z. Ohkanda J. Hamilton A.D. Munoz-Antonia T. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggested that a farnesylated protein other than Ras may be responsible for the inhibition of TβR-II expression. Here we show that RhoB, a member of the Ras superfamily, suppresses TβR-II expression. Furthermore, RhoB also inhibited TGF-β-stimulated signaling and prevented TGF-β anti-proliferative effect. The fact that RhoB blocks TGF-β signaling is consistent with previous reports that show that RhoB inhibits TGF-β stimulation of p3TPLux in Mv1Lu cells (41Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RhoA, a closely related member to RhoB, had no effect on TβR-II expression. The lack of effect of RhoA on TβR-II expression cannot be generalized to all cell types since a previous study has shown the ability of RhoA to regulate TβR-II transcription in chicken embryonic heart cells (59Park H.J. Galper J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11525-11530Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is clear, however, that the repression of TβR-II by RhoB in Panc-1 and HaCaT cells is specific because neither RhoA nor Ras affect the transcriptional activity of the TβR-II promoter.The physiological function of RhoB appears to be different from that of other Rho family members such as, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. For example, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 promote cell proliferation, transformation, and metastasis (31Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), whereas RhoB has been shown to antagonize malignant transformation and suppress human tumor growth in nude mice (39Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,60Lebowitz P.F. Davide J.P. Prendergast G.C. Mol.

In contrast to other Rho family members, RhoB has a short half-life, is present in low levels in growing cells, and is inducible by stress such as UV and DNA-damaging agents (63Fritz G. Kaina B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30637-30644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 64Zalcman G. Closson V. Linares-Cruz G. Lerebours F. Honore N. Tavitian A. Olofsson B.

The induction of RhoB during stress suggests that RhoB may play a role in cell growth control and/or DNA repair mechanisms. This is supported by the fact that overexpression of RhoB, whether in its geranylgeranylated form (RhoB-GG) or farnesylated form (RhoB-F), inhibits tumor cell growth and transformation (39Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Furthermore, RhoB and the other low molecular weight GTPases (i.e. RhoA and Rac1) also differ in their ability to modulate transcription via AP1. The results of our analysis with TβR-II promoter mutant constructs revealed that the AP1 site at position −185 from the transcription start site is critical for RhoB regulatory effect. The binding of AP1 to its DNA-binding site on the TβR-II promoter was strongly decreased by RhoB. Thus, RhoB represses TβR-II transcription by inhibiting, at least in part, the binding of AP1 to its DNA-binding site. This is consistent with our previous finding, demonstrating the ability of farnesyl transferase inhibitor, FTI-277 to enhance the binding of AP1 to DNA (29Adnane J. Bizouarn F.A. Chen Z. Ohkanda J. Hamilton A.D. Munoz-Antonia T. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although RhoA and Rac1 stimulate AP1 transcriptional activity as a result of the activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK)-signaling complex (66Atfi A. Djelloul S. Chastre E. Davis R. Gespach C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1429-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 67Karin M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), RhoB, on the other hand, suppresses AP1-mediated transcription (this report), possibly by inhibiting the above-mentioned pathway. Our studies raise questions concerning the role of RhoB in the SAPK/JNK signaling pathway and the role of this pathway in TβR-II transcription regulation. RhoB modulation of AP1 activity provides a mechanism linking RhoB to nuclear events regulating gene transcription. Previous studies have shown that p21waf1/cip1, interleukin 3, prepronendothelin-1, and c-fos genes to be transcriptionally regulated by RhoB (47Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,68Lebowitz P.F. Prendergast G.C. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 6: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 69Hernandez-Perera O. Perez-Sala D. Soria E. Lamas S. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Whether the regulation of these genes by RhoB is mediated by AP1 remains to be determined.RhoB suppression of TβR-II transcription is one of the mechanisms by which RhoB may modulate cellular responsiveness to TGF-β. In normal, TGF-β-sensitive cells, TGF-β increases the levels of RhoB by preventing its ubiquitination and, thus, inhibiting its degradation (41Engel M.E. Datta P.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9921-9926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). RhoB, in turn, modulates TGF-β signaling by suppressing TβR-II expression. Thus, the inhibition of TβR-II expression by RhoB may represent a negative feedback loop that regulates TGF-β signal transduction, thus contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis in normal cells. Conversely, in TGF-β-resistant tumor cells, lack of TGF-β signals would decrease the RhoB protein level, contributing to the dysregulation of RhoB-regulated molecules such as p21waf1/cip1 and, thus, promote tumor progression. This is consistent with our recent data demonstrating that overexpression of RhoB antagonizes malignant transformation (39Chen Z. Sun J. Pradines A. Favre G. Adnane J. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17974-17978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1in a wide variety of human tumors has been associated with inactivation of either the TGF-β receptors or their substrates, the Smad proteins (1Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms for the inactivation of these molecules include inactivating mutations, increased degradation, and transcriptional down-regulation (2Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, there is a strong association between TGF-β type II receptor (TβR-II) inactivation and cancer because many tumors express low levels of TβR-II mRNA and/or protein, and this lack of TβR-II expression correlates with resistance to the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β (3Serrero G.

https://openalex.org/W2040054861,"Although the functional significance of neuronal phospholipase D (PLD) is being recognized, little is known about its regulatory role in neuronal cells. To elucidate the regulatory mechanism of neuronal PLD, we investigated PLD2-binding neuronal protein from rat brain cytosol. During the fractionation of rat brain cytosol by four-column chromatography, a 62-kDa PLD2-interacting protein was detected by PLD2 overlay assay and identified as collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2), which controls neuronal axon guidance and outgrowth. Using bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins, we found that two regions (amino acids 65–192 (the phagocytic oxidase domain) and 724–825) of PLD2 and a single region (amino acids 243–300) of CRMP-2 are required for the direct binding of both proteins. A co-immunoprecipitation study in COS-7 cells also showed anin vivo interaction between CRMP-2 and PLD2. Interestingly, CRMP-2 was found to potently inhibit PLD2activity in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 30 nm). Overexpression studies also showed that CRMP-2 is an in vivo inhibitor of PLD2 in PC12 cells. Moreover, increasing the concentration of semaphorin 3A, one of the repulsive axon guidance cues, showed that PLD2 activity can be inhibited in PC12 cells. Immunocytochemistry further revealed that PLD2 is co-localized with CRMP-2 in the distal tips of neurites, its possible action site, in differentiated PC12 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that CRMP-2 may interact directly with and inhibit neuronal PLD2, suggesting that this inhibitory mode of regulation may play a role in neuronal pathfinding during the developmental stage.

These isozymes have a sequence homology exceeding 50% and contain several domains (conserved regions I-IV) that are highly conserved in the PLD superfamily and that are dependent on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate for their activity. PLD1 can be activated by many cytosolic factors, including protein kinase C and small GTP-binding proteins such as Rac1, Cdc42, ADP-ribosylation factor-1, and RhoA (10Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M.

In this regard, we believed an investigation of neuronal PLD regulation was warranted to further determine its function. Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2) is a cytosolic phosphoprotein that is exclusively expressed in the nervous system (21Kamata T. Subleski M. Hara Y. Yuhki N. Kung H. Copeland N.G.

It has been suggested to be a key mediator of semaphorin 3A action, one of the repulsive guidance cues that leads to growth cone collapse during neuronal axon guidance (22Goshima Y. Nakamura F.

In this study, we found for the first time that CRMP-2 specifically inhibits PLD2 activity by direct interaction. In addition, we tried to elucidate the role of CRMP-2 in the regulation of PLD2 in neuronal cells using PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells as a model system. Thus, we hope that this study will provide several clues concerning the involvement of PLD2 in growth cone collapse. V8 protease, dipalmitoylphosphatidyl[methyl-3H]choline, chelating Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, the HiTrap heparin column, and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL system) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgA, IgM, and IgG were from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). The Bio-Gel HTP column and the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were from Bio-Rad. Anti-actin antibody was from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). β-Octyl glucopyranoside was obtained from Calbiochem.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen. Anti-neuropilin-1 polyclonal antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Immobilized protein A was from Pierce. A polyclonal antibody that recognizes both PLD1 and PLD2 was generated as described previously (23Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All preparations were performed at 4 °C in a refrigerated room or on ice. Adult rat brains (total of 30 g) were homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer in homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected. The cytosolic fraction (900 mg) was applied to a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (13 × 3 cm) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Unbound proteins (flow-through fractions) were collected, and NaCl was added as salt to 2 m. After centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 20 min, the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (70 × 2 cm). Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 2 ml/min by applying a decreasing gradient of NaCl (2 to 0m) over 60 min. Fractions were collected and tested by PLD2 overlay assay. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted with buffer A to adjust the salt concentration to 50 mmNaCl and then loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0.05–1m NaCl over 30 min. Fractions were collected and also tested by PLD2 overlay assay. Fractions containing PLD2-interacting proteins were pooled and continuously loaded onto a Bio-Gel HTP column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Bound proteins were then eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using an increasing gradient of KH2PO4 (0–0.25 m). Fractions were collected and tested by PLD2 overlay assay. The fractions containing p62 were collected and stored at −70 °C for further study. Hexahistidine-tagged human PLD2 was purified from detergent extracts of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells by chelating Sepharose affinity column chromatography as described previously (15Kim J.H.

The assay method used was a modification of one described previously (24Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y, Ha, S.H. Kim J.H. Yoo J., Du, G. Frohman M.A. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol.

In brief, rat brain cytosolic proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were preincubated overnight with PLD assay buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 3 mmEGTA, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mmMgCl2, and 80 mm KCl) containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and 5% (w/v) skimmed milk at room temperature and reincubated with the same buffer containing 1 μg/ml purified PLD2 for 3 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed several times with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and reacted with polyclonal antibodies directed against PLD for 3 h. After washing with TTBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies for 1 h and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit as described by the manufacturer. Purified PLD2-interacting protein from the hydroxylapatite column was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with V8 protease obtained from Staphylococcus aureus and then subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE to separate the cleaved peptides. After transferring the peptides to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, they were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, rinsed several times with 30% methanol, excised, and subjected to Edman degradation. The candidate protein was identified by sequencing (ABI473 Sequencer) at the Institute of Basic Science (Busan, Korea) and by comparing the results obtained from the Swiss Protein Database using the BlastP algorithm. Affinity-purified anti-PLD2 antibodies immobilized with protein A beads were first incubated with purified PLD2 for 2 h at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the precipitates were reincubated with the indicated amounts of purified CRMP-2 for 15 min at 37 °C in PLD assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Binding site mapping between PLD2 and CRMP-2 was performed by incubating the indicated amounts of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins with purified PLD2 or rat CRMP-2, respectively, under the same buffer conditions for 15 min at 37 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the pellets were washed three times with the same buffer before being loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel. The full-length coding region of human CRMP-2 was ligated into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-4T1 vector to make a GST fusion protein (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). To construct the deletion mutants of CRMP-2, the full-length coding region of human CRMP-2 was also digested into N- and C-terminal serial deletion mutants by random cleavage. The deletion mutants were then ligated into the 5′-EcoRI and 3′-SalI sites of the same vector. The phagocytic oxidase and pleckstrin homology domains were constructed by digesting the PCR products using the restriction enzymes 5′-EcoRI and 3′-SalI and inserted into the pGEX-4T1 vector. The pCMV vector was used as the mammalian expression vector of CRMP-2. The full-length coding region of human CRMP-2 was ligated into the 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XbaI sites of the pCMV vector (CLONTECH). Standard methods were used for subcloning and PCR to produce expression vectors encoding the respective GST fusion proteins (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 cells were transfected with individual expression vectors encoding the GST fusion proteins and grown. The GST fusion proteins thus obtained were purified by standard methods (26Lee S. Park J.B. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Kim J.H. Shin K.-J. Lee J.S., Ha, S.H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28252-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The PLD activity assay was performed by measuring choline release from phosphatidylcholine as described previously (27Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), but with minor modifications. In brief, the reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min in a 125-μl assay mixture containing PLD assay buffer, the PLD preparation, and 25 μl of phospholipid vesicles composed of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at a molar ratio of 16:1.4:1 and dipalmitoylphosphatidyl[methyl-3H]choline (total of 150,000 cpm/assay). The reactions were terminated by adding 0.3 ml of a solution containing 1 n HCl and 5 mm EGTA and 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (50:50:0.3). After a brief centrifugation, the amount of [methyl-3H]choline in 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells were prepared using the tetracycline-regulated expression system (TET-OFF, Invitrogen) as described previously (28Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Clonal cell lines were usually maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml tetracycline, 10% (v/v) equine serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were differentiated by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml) for 4 days. The COS-7 cells were maintained in growth medium composed of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 (5%)-controlled incubator. To induce the transient expression of human PLD2 or human CRMP-2, COS-7 or PC12 cells were plated at densities of 1 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm dishes and 1 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates, respectively, and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described previously (29Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar). After transfecting COS-7 cells with human PLD2 or human CRMP-2 cDNA, the cells were harvested and lysed by brief sonication in PLD assay buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. The cells were then centrifuged at 100, 000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant was incubated on anti-FLAG M2 antibody-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. After three washings with the same incubation buffer, the final pellet was loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis. Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting using the Bio-Rad wet transfer system. After blocking in TTBS containing 5% skim milk powder, the membranes were incubated with individual monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies and then further incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocytochemistry was performed based on a procedure reported previously (31Kim Y. Han J.M. Han B.R. Lee K.-A. Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Jang I.-H. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13621-13627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, FLAG-CRMP-2-transfected PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells in the presence of nerve growth factor were grown on coverslips for 4 days, rinsed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing with PBS and blocking with PBS containing 1% goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml primary polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies specific to PLD and FLAG for 2 h at room temperature. After washing six times with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody were incubated with the cells for 1 h to allow the visualization of PLD2 and CRMP-2. After six washings with PBS, the slides were examined under a Zeiss confocal microscope. In vivo PLD activity was determined as described previously (32Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 294: 130-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In brief, PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 48 h. The cells were loaded with [3H]myristic acid (2 μCi/ml) for 4 h and then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The loaded cells were incubated with 0.4% butanol for 5 min in the presence of the indicated concentrations of semaphorin 3A, scraped into 0.8 ml of methanol and 1 m NaCl (1:1), and mixed with 0.4 ml of chloroform. The organic phases were dried, and the lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates. The PLD activity of the vector or human CRMP-2-transfected PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells was determined using the same procedure. The amount of [3H]phosphatidylbutanol formed was expressed as a percentage of the total 3H-lipid to account for cell labeling efficiency differences. The cytosolic fraction (900 mg of proteins) of rat brain was fractionated by sequential column chromatography, and the fractions thus obtained were subjected to a blot overlay assay using PLD2 to explore the major PLD2-binding proteins. Initially, the flow-through fraction from the Q-Sepharose column was subjected to phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography. The blot overlay assay showed that the proteins with relative molecular masses of 62 kDa (p62) and 40 kDa (p40), which coeluted in a linear gradient of 1.8 to 1.6 m NaCl from the phenyl-Sepharose column, were major PLD2-binding proteins (data not shown). A further purification step was performed to purify the PLD2-binding proteins on a HiTrap heparin column. p62 and p40 were also coeluted in 0.2 m NaCl as determined by the overlay assay, but other minor bands were removed by column chromatography (data not shown). Using a hydroxylapatite column, p62 and p40 were separately eluted by 0.15–0.2 m and 0.2–0.25m KH2PO4, respectively (Fig.1 A). SDS-PAGE showed that the p62 yield was 0.7 mg, assuming proportionality between the band densities and the protein quantities after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1 B). The p62 protein was also detected on the overlay blot (Fig. 1 C). These results suggest that the 62-kDa protein purified from rat brain cytosol binds directly with PLD2. The identity of p62 in fractions containing nearly homogeneous 62-kDa protein (>90%) was determined in two ways. First, the p62 peptide produced by V8 protease was sequenced, and its N-terminal sequence was identified as KKNIPRITSDDLLIK. This sequence was then searched for in the Swiss Protein Database using the BlastP peptide program. The search showed that this sequence is almost identical to an internal sequence (amino acids 6–20) of rat CRMP (rCRMP), especially of CRMP-2 and CRMP-4 (Fig.2 A). However, CRMP-4 has an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa, which does not match that of purified p62 and which suggests that p62 might be a CRMP-2. p62 was then identified as CRMP-2 by immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibody specific to CRMP-2 (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we suggest that the 62-kDa protein identified as a PLD2 direct binder is a rCRMP-2. In vitro binding and immunoblot analyses were used to determine whether CRMP-2 associates directly with PLD2. As shown in Fig.3 A, purified rCRMP-2 interacted specifically with PLD2, but not with the anti-PLD antibody-protein A-Sepharose complexes alone, confirming a direct interaction between CRMP-2 and PLD2. To identify the region in PLD2 responsible for this CRMP-2 binding, we constructed and prepared GST fusion proteins of PLD2fragments as indicated in Fig. 3 B. The GST fusion proteins were then tested for their ability to bind to rCRMP-2. As shown in Fig.3 C, rCRMP-2 interacted with both the N-terminal (amino acids 1–314) and C-terminal (amino acids 724–825) regions of PLD2, whereas no interaction was observed with the other regions. To identify the PLD2 N-terminal site responsible for CRMP-2 binding, we constructed GST-tagged phagocytic oxidase- and pleckstrin homology-like domains for in vitro binding analysis. The results obtained showed that CRMP-2 bound to the phagocytic oxidase domain (amino acids 65–192) in the N-terminal region of PLD2 (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that two regions (amino acids 65–192 and 724–825) of PLD2are responsible for its binding to CRMP-2. To identify the region of CRMP-2 responsible for binding to PLD2, we generated N- and C-terminal deletion mutants of human CRMP-2 (hCRMP-2). It should also be noted that hCRMP-2 is almost identical to rCRMP-2 (99% sequence identity) (33Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed by the stepwise removal of hCRMP-2. Wild-type hCRMP-2 and all of its deletion mutants were tagged with GST, affinity-purified, and examined in terms of their ability to bind to PLD2. The results obtained using C-terminal deletion mutants showed that PLD2 interacted directly with C2 (amino acids 1–300) of hCRMP-2, but not with C3 (amino acids 1–143) of hCRMP-2. This suggests that amino acids 144–300 of hCRMP-2 may be important for binding to PLD2 (Fig. 4 B). The purity and quantity of the C-terminal deletion mutants of hCRMP-2 were verified by Ponceau staining (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). To further identify the PLD2-binding site in CRMP-2, GST-tagged N-terminal serial deletion mutants of hCRMP-2 were subjected to a pull-down assay and immunoblot analysis. Fig.4 C shows that amino acids 243–300 of hCRMP-2 were involved in the binding of PLD2. Our results suggest that a region (amino acids 243–300) of CRMP-2 may be important for PLD2binding. To verify that PLD2 and CRMP-2 interactin vivo, we cotransfected hCRMP-2 and human PLD2cDNAs into COS-7 cells and performed immunoblot analysis after immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged hCRMP-2 using anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, PLD2 was found to interact specifically with CRMP-2 in these cells, suggesting that PLD2 forms a complex with CRMP-2 in COS-7 cells. We next examined whether CRMP-2 plays a role in the regulation of PLD2 by measuring the effect of CRMP-2 on PLD2 activity in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, purified rCRMP-2 was found to specifically inhibit PLD2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Under these conditions, the IC50 of this CRMP-2-mediated inhibition was ∼30 nm, and inhibition was complete at 150 nm. To further evaluate the effect of CRMP-2 on PLD2 activity, GST-tagged wild-type hCRMP-2 and its deletion mutants N3 (amino acids 243–573) and N4 (amino acids 301–573) were reconstituted in a PLD activity assay. As expected, N3 (amino acids 243–573) showed an inhibitory potency comparable to that of wild-type hCRMP-2. However, GST alone or N4 (amino acids 301–573) did not inhibit PLD2activity, although they were added to the assay up to 150 nm, at which level PLD2 activity was completely inhibited by wild-type hCRMP-2 (Fig. 6). This result is consistent with the in vitro binding analysis (Fig. 4, B andC). In summary, we suggest that amino acids 243–300 of CRMP-2 may be essential for binding to and inhibiting PLD2. To determine the effect of CRMP-2 in neuronal cells, we transfected hCRMP-2 into PLD2-overexpressing PC12 cells, which are able to induce PLD2 expression upon tetracycline withdrawal (28Lee S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2038840582,"We have cloned the cDNAs for two novel human proteins, designated BNIP-Sα and β (for BNIP-2Similar) that are homologous to BNIP-2, a previously known Bcl-2 and E1B-associated protein. The BNIP-S gene encodes two protein isoforms; the longer protein (BNIP-Sα) contains a completeBNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP Homology (BCH) domain, a novel protein domain that we recently identified, whereas its shorter variant (BNIP-Sβ) lacks the full BCH domain as a result of an alternative RNA splicing that introduces a nonsense intron. Primer-specific reverse-transcription PCR revealed that both BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ mRNA are differentially expressed in various cells and tissues. The expression of BNIP-Sα or the complete BCH domain, but not BNIP-Sβ, causes extensive apoptosis in cells. Furthermore, BNIP-Sα can form a homophilic complex via a unique sequence motif within its BCH domain, and deletion of this interacting motif prevents its pro-apoptotic effect. These results indicate the presence of two BNIP-S splicing variants as cellular regulators and that the BCH domain of BNIP-Sα confers a novel apoptotic function.

Major cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, and death are governed by intracellular signaling that depends on molecular recognition between subsets of interacting proteins. The interaction between proteins depends on endogenous interaction sequences (domains) that orchestrate individual contacts. Although interaction domains within proteins were relatively recently discovered many are still being revealed and characterized, and few are understood in depth. These domains can either serve as protein docking/interaction sites, where multiple proteins can associate to form a functional complex or they may take part in binding to other molecules such as DNA or lipids, or be involved in enzymatic reactions (1Hunter T.

In some cases, domains act as endogenous regulatory switches, where they can interact with binding partners within the host protein and modify the tertiary conformation and function of the protein. The recent refinement of various bioinformatic tools has allowed the rapid and reliable identification of many conserved domains. A survey of the protein domain data bases deposited in the NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and InterPro data bases (www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) (6Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Birney E.

In the post-genomic era the research emphasis is focusing on identifying the functions for the protein products of the ∼30,000 genes in the human genome (7Baltimore D. Nature. 2001; 409: 814-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As protein function depends on domain interactions it is essential to understand the interaction parameters, including the possible regulation, of each domain. Apoptosis is an exquisitely controlled suicidal mechanism in cells. This process is fundamental to the growth of tissue and the development of an organism (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem.

Tissue modeling in the embryo relies on the balance between the proliferation and death of certain subsets of cells. In the adult animal if too many cells fail to die cancer can ensure, whereas excess apoptosis can lead to “degradation” disease conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases, liver failure, and myocardial infarction. Various functional domains have been deemed to be important for regulating apoptosis, as exemplified by the Bcl-2 domain (8Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem.

Clearly additional domains that are important for apoptosis remain to be identified, and the full extent of their various interactions and regulation need to be fully characterized in order to obtain an integrated perspective of apoptosis.

This novel sequence contains about 145 amino acids and was initially shown to be common to two proteins: BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP. BNIP-2 was originally shown to be an interacting protein for both the viral E1B p19KDa protein and the Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein (25Boyd J.M. Malstrom S. Subramanian T. Venkatesh L.K. Schaeper U. Elangovan B. D'Sa-Eipper C. Chinnadurai G. Cell. 1994; 79: 341-351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), whereas Cdc42GAP (also known as p50-RhoGAP) is a GTPase-activating protein that down-regulates the small GTPase Cdc42 (26Barfod E.T.

Brill S. van Erp H.E. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1137-1142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BCH domain of BNIP-2 acts as a non-canonical GTPase-activating protein domain for Cdc42, which involves a novel arginine finger (23Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14415-14422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The BCH domain of BNIP-2 also forms both homophilic associations with itself and a heterophilic complex with Cdc42GAP. In each case the association negatively regulates the associated GTPase-activating protein activity (24Low B.C. Seow K.T. Guy G.R. J. Biol.

BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP Homology reverse transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione S-transferase green fluorescence protein expressed sequence tag BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP Homology reverse transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase glutathione S-transferase green fluorescence protein expressed sequence tag To further characterize the BCH domain and its potential role in cell signaling we set out to characterize the domain within the context of novel proteins that contain this sequence. Here we report the identification and characterization of two novel alternatively spliced isoforms of proteins that are similar to BNIP-2, termed BNIP-S (BNIP -2-Similar) and showed that the BCH domain of the BNIP-Sα isoform confers its apoptotic activity via a motif that is also required for its homophilic interaction. To search for novel proteins that contain BCH domains, the peptide sequence of either full-length BNIP-2 or the BCH domain (residues 167–303) was used to carry out BLAST searches using the “tblastn” and “position-specific iterative BLAST” method against the current non-redundant sequence data base as well as human and mouse EST data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). All BCH domains were identified without iteration using unfiltered query sequences. One putative member was initially identified by the accession numberAF193056 with several human ESTs (AI620433, W80385) covering sequences of its putative open reading frame. Subsequently, a mouse homolog was identified in the data base (BC005659). This gene was termedBNIP-S, for BNIP-2-Similar. The multiple sequence alignment was generated using ClustalW (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55365) Google Scholar) (www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). To obtain the full-length cDNA of BNIP-S, total RNA was isolated from 293T cells using the RNeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5 μg of this RNA was subjected to the first-strand cDNA synthesis with Expand Reverse Transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) primed with oligo(dT) (Operon) for 60 min at 42 °C in a total volume of 20 μl. 0.5 μl of this cDNA was then amplified by the high fidelity, long-template Taqpolymerase enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using specific primers corresponding to either the full-length BNIP-S or various fragments of it. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation 94 °C, 2 min; subsequent cycling (30 cycles) at 94 °C, 10 s; annealing at 60 °C, 30 s; extension at 68 °C, 2 min; and final extension at 68 °C, 7 min. These PCR primers contained BamHI andXhoI restriction sites on the forward and reverse primers, respectively, to facilitate their subsequent cloning. The full-length PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen) and cloned into a FLAG epitope-tagged expression vector, pXJ40 (Dr. E. Manser, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore). cDNA fragments encoding the various domains of BNIP-S were generated from the full-length template using specific primers in a standard PCR and then gel purified for cloning. Deletion mutants of BNIP-Sα were generated by PCR using specific primers facilitated by restriction sites. For each construct, several clones were chosen and sequenced entirely in both directions using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystem). A GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH) was used to amplify the corresponding gene fragment of BNIP-S and identify the region of insert as an intron. All plasmids were purified using Qiagen miniprep kit for subsequent use in transfection experiments. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used as host for the propagation of the clones. Reagents used were of analytical grade, and standard protocols for molecular manipulations and media preparation were as described (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To distinguish the mRNA expression level of BNIP-Sα, BNIP-Sβ, and BNIP-2 in various cells and tissues, RT-PCR using the full-length BNIP-S or BNIP-2 gene primers was employed. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from either various cultured cell lines or from various organs obtained from a 2-week-old male mouse and primed for the first-strand cDNA synthesis as described above. Equal amounts of the reverse transcription product was then subjected to PCR amplification for BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ. The house-keeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used to normalize the level of expression. The results were verified in at least two independent experiments with varying numbers of PCR cycles to ensure near-linear amplification. To further validate the weak expression of BNIP-S in mouse tissues/organs, PCR products were hybridized with a gene-specific probe, and signals were detected using the CSPD® chemiluminescence-based Southern blot analyses system according to the instructions of manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Human MCF-7, 293T, MCN45, and KMN74 were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Sigma), and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose, whereas HT29 and HCT116 were grown in McCoy's medium (Sigma). Cells at 90% confluence in 100-mm plates or 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg or 0.4 μg of the indicated plasmids using Effectene cationic lipids, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Control cells or cells transfected with expression plasmids were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mmmagnesium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates that were directly analyzed, either as whole-cell lysates (25 μg) or aliquots (500 μg), were used in affinity precipitation/pulldown experiments with various GST fusion proteins (5 μg), as previously described (23Low B.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37742-37751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Samples were run in SDS/PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting with FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates, transfected with various expression constructs for 16 h, and then stained for immunofluorescence detection using confocal fluorescence microscopy as previously described (30Lim J. Wong E.S. Ong S.H. Yusoff P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32837-32845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged proteins were detected with monoclonal anti-FLAG followed by Texas Red® dye-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). For cells expressing GFP-tagged recombinants, the morphology of cells was examined directly under a fluorescent microscope at the times indicated after the transfection. Cells grown in 35-mm plates to 70% confluence were transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of either vector control or expression plasmids for full-length BNIP-Sα, BNIP-Sβ, or their various deletion domains, together with 0.1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase as the marker. These cells were transfected with the marker at one-fourth the level of test cDNAs such that every cell that expressed β-galactosidase and subsequently stained blue should also express the query protein. After 16 h, cells were fixed, incubated in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside buffer to mark the β-galactosidase expressing cells, and visualized by phase contrast light microscopy (31Chan S.L. Tan K.O. Zhang L. Yee K.S. Ronca F. Chan M.Y. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2461-2468Google Scholar). The percentages of apoptotic cells were assessed from 6–9 random fields containing at least 300 cells and were scored positive if rounded and stained dark blue. At least three separate experiments were performed with each analysis done in duplicate. Exposure of phosphatidylserine on outer membrane is a key sign of apoptosis, which can be readily recognized by annexin V. Cells grown in 60-mm plates were transfected with 2 μg of vector or expression constructs of BNIP-Sα for 6 h. They were immediately assayed for annexin V binding and propidium iodide staining using the ApoAlert annexin V-EGFP apoptosis kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instruction and examined by microscopy. Cells that bound annexin V but did not take up propidium iodide underwent early apoptosis, whereas cells that were positive for both markers indicated late apoptosis. Live cells were negative for both staining, and necrotic cells were only stained by propidium iodide. To stain for chromatin integrity, cells transfected with 2 μg of vector or expression constructs of BNIP-Sα were incubated for 10 min with 10 μg/ml of Hoechst dye (Sigma), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and examined by microscopy. Cells undergoing apoptosis exhibited an irregular pattern of staining with Hoechst dye compared with homogenous staining in live cells (32Spector D.L. Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). To isolate putative clones encoding proteins that bear a similar BCH domain to BNIP-2, we performed PSI-BLAST by using either the full-length sequence of BNIP-2 or its BCH domain against the non-redundant, as well as human and mouse EST data bases of GenBankTM. Our searches revealed several novel protein/DNA sequences that harbor or encode BCH domains with varying degrees of homology. One clone was initially identified (accession numberAF193056) with several human ESTs (AI620433, W80385) spanning parts of its putative open reading frame. Subsequently, a mouse homolog was also identified in the data base (BC005659). This cDNA was termedBNIP-S, for BNIP-2-Similar. The open reading frame and parts of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the sequence AF193056 was amplified by RT-PCR, as shown in Fig.1 A. Several pairs of primers, indicated by the arrows, were designed against the open reading frame in order to isolate the full-length or partial cDNA from human 293T cells. To maximize the chance of obtaining the cDNA, total RNA was isolated from 293T cells grown in media with or without 10% serum, pooled and subjected to RT-PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” The PCR products were resolved in 1% agarose gel, stained, and visualized (Fig. 1 B). The results show that all primer pairs generated various DNA fragments of the predicted sizes. However, when the full-length primer pairs (lane 1) or primer pairs that covered specifically the 3′-end of the open reading frame (including the new BCH domain) were used (lanes 4 and 5), there was an unexpected, but distinct additional fragment. No bands were detectable in samples without reverse transcriptase, confirming that these products were not derived from genomic DNA (data not shown). The result implies that there were two transcripts of BNIP-S in 293T cells with the larger fragment carrying a longer 3′-end at its open reading frame. To verify this possibility, the predicted 825-bp (full-length fragment-α) and the additional longer fragment (full-length fragment-β) cDNAs were separated and gel purified, and multiple clones were then isolated and sequenced for direct identification. Sequencing of both cDNA fragments revealed that there was an insertion of 154 bp in the larger transcript within the sequence encoding the BCH domain, but the rest of the sequences were essentially identical. This raised the possibility that such an insertion may have occurred by means of an alternative RNA splicing. To test this hypothesis, the same sets of full-length PCR primers were used to amplify human genomic DNA. In all cases, only one size of fragment was obtained (Fig. 1 C). The full-length fragment (lane 1) was subsequently cloned, sequenced and shown to be identical to the fragment-β obtained by RT-PCR. This result confirms that fragment-β (BNIP-Sβ) was derived by the retention of the 154-bp intron during the process of mRNA maturation, whereas this intron was removed in fragment-α (BNIP-Sα). Consistent with the notion of intron retention is the finding that there is the sequence (XGT … AG) at the junction of the 154-bp insertion (Fig. 1 D). This sequence conforms to the consensus signature for exon/intron splice site in the eukaryotic system (33Iida Y. J. Theor. Biol. 1990; 145: 23-33Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Overall, BNIP-Sα is 72% homologous (46% identity) to BNIP-2 with extensive homology (85%) in the region encompassing the BCH domain but with lower homology at the N terminus (Fig.2 A). While the longer protein (275 amino acids; termed BNIP-Sα) contains the complete BCH domain, the 154-bp insertion of the intron in BNIP-Sβ cDNA introduced an in-frame stop codon in its unspliced mRNA resulting in a truncation within the BCH domain, hence a shorter peptide (204 amino acids). When compared with the mouse sequence, the human BNIP-Sα is shorter by 53 amino acids at the N terminus. Interestingly, this additional region in mouse BNIP-Sα is homologous to the N terminus of BNIP-2. The BCH domain of BNIP-Sα is predicted to comprise several α-helices, and like those of BNIP-2 and Cdc42GAP, it also shares about 25% homology to the phospholipid-binding domain (Sec-14p) of the yeast phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, Sec-14 (34Aravind L. Neuwald A.F. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 195-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). This raises some interesting issues on the potential structural and functional relationship between these two protein domains, as will be discussed later. To understand the potential roles of the BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ, we examined their relative pattern of expression in various established cell lines from different tissue origins as well as in mouse tissues/organs. Since BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ mRNA vary by the relatively short 154-bp insertion, their relative abundance would not be easily distinguishable by conventional Northern analyses. Furthermore, their relatively high degree of homology with BNIP-2 could result in cross-hybridization of the BNIP-S probes to the mRNA of BNIP-2 or other potentially yet undiscovered homologs. To avoid such confusion, total RNA were isolated from target cells, reverse-transcribed to cDNA, and amplified by PCR using primers that were only specific to BNIP-Sα, BNIP-Sβ, or BNIP-2. Results in Fig. 3 A show that BNIP-Sα mRNA was predominantly detected in human breast cancer MCF-7 (lane 2) and monkey kidney fibroblast COS-1 cells (lane 4), whereas the expression of BNIP-Sβ in these two cell lines was very low. In contrast, there were relatively high levels of BNIP-Sβ mRNA in human HeLa cervical epithelial cells (lane 1) and human 293T embryonic transformed kidney epithelial cells (lane 3). Furthermore, two human stomach cancer lines, MCN45 and KMN74, and two human colon epithelial cell lines, HT29 and HCT116, expressed low amounts of BNIP-Sα mRNA but no detectable BNIP-Sβ (lanes 5–8). In contrast to the differential expression of the BNIP-S isoforms, BNIP-2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in all cell lines tested. Equal expression of the house-keeping GAPDH confirms the equal loading of samples for the RT-PCR. Next, the expression levels of BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ were examined in different organs of a 2-week-old male mouse by utilizing similar RT-PCR protocols (Fig. 3 B). Intriguingly, all tissues examined such as liver, lung, kidney, brain, intestine, heart, and testis (lanes 1–5, 7–8; top panel) exhibited weak signals corresponding to BNIP-Sα but not BNIP-Sβ, and the only organ showing elevated levels of BNIP-Sα expression was the penis (lane 6). To further validate that these weak bands observed were truly BNIP-Sα, the first PCR products were used as templates for amplification with internal PCR primers corresponding to region CBCH (amino acids 91–275; see Fig. 6 A). The products would better distinguish the BNIP-Sα (554 bp) and BNIP-Sβ (706 bp). The results (second panel) confirmed the initial finding, which was further supported by Southern blot analyses using a gene-specific probe (Fig. 3 C) and partial sequencing of the mouse cDNA from the liver. In comparison, BNIP-2 was relatively highly expressed across all tissues and organs, whereas GAPDH expression levels in those samples were identical. There is no immediate explanation for the pattern of expression for the two isoforms of BNIP-S. Their apparent differential distribution in various cells and tissues may suggest a physiologically and developmentally regulated expression pattern and indicate that they may also play different roles in the cells. As a first stage in investigating their potential physiological function(s), BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ were overexpressed in MCF-7 cells to investigate their intracellular distribution and any effects they may have on cell growth and morphology. MCF-7 cells were transfected for 16 h with FLAG-tagged full-length cDNAs for BNIP-Sα and BNIP-Sβ and processed for analysis by confocal microscopy (Fig.4 A, left panels). The result shows that 70–80% of the cells transfected with full-length BNIP-Sα exhibited a dramatic rounding, where BNIP-Sα itself was found mainly localized in the cytosol. In addition, some of these cells had elongated extensions that resembled “beads-on-a thread” structure (indicated by arrows) where BNIP-Sα was also concentrated. In contrast, all cells transfected with BNIP-Sβ exhibited similar morphology as the control cells (transfected with vector alone) but with most of the protein being localized in the nucleus (indicated by arrows). Similar observations were made using direct labeling of transfected cells utilizing a similar protocol except for GFP being conjugated to the target proteins (Fig. 4 A, right panels). The cells over-expressing BNIP-Sα again displayed drastic rounding, one of the common features of cells undergoing apoptosis, whereas BNIP-Sβ (localized to the nucleus; indicated byarrow) had no effect on the cell morphology. To further investigate the notion that BNIP-Sα could indeed cause apoptosis, several other biochemical and morphological assays indicative of this process were also performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” First, annexin V binding for phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane and propidium iodide staining for nuclei showed that cells transfected with FLAG-tagged BNIP-Sα exhibited extensive annexin V binding without significant propidium iodide staining. This indicates an early apoptosis event where phosphatidylserine translocated to the outer membrane while cells were relatively still intact (Fig. 4 B). Second, when cells were transfected with GFP-BNIP-Sα, there were irregular chromatin staining patterns with Hoechst DNA dye when compared with the homogenous nuclei staining in GFP vector controls (Fig. 4 C;arrows indicate transfected cells). Third, co-transfection of BNIP-Sα with a β-galactosidase reporter gene also revealed features of cell-rounding, shrinkage and apparent detachment (Fig. 4D). To ensure that these effec"

Unlike cyclic sugar Ado analogue inhibitors, including mechanism-based inhibitors, DEA is an acyclic sugar Ado analogue, and the C2′ and C3′ have opposite chirality to those of the cyclic sugar Ado inhibitors. Crystal structures of DEA alone and in complex with AdoHcyase have been determined to elucidate the DEA binding scheme to AdoHcyase. The DEA-complexed structure has been analyzed by comparing it with two structures of AdoHcyase complexed with cyclic sugar Ado analogues. The DEA-complexed structure has a closed conformation, and the DEA is located near the bound NAD+. However, a UV absorption measurement shows that DEA is not oxidized by the bound NAD+, indicating that the open-closed conformational change of AdoHcyase is due to the substrate/inhibitor binding, not the oxidation state of the bound NAD. The adenine ring of DEA is recognized by four essential hydrogen bonds as observed in the cyclic sugar Ado complexes. The hydrogen bond network around the acyclic sugar moiety indicates that DEA is more tightly connected to the protein than the cyclic sugar Ado analogues. The C3′-H of DEA is pointed toward C4 of the bound NAD+ (C3′···C4 = 3.7 Å), suggesting some interaction between DEA and NAD+. By placing DEA into the active site of the open structure, the major forces to stabilize the closed conformation of AdoHcyase are identified as the hydrogen bonds between the backbone of His-352 and the adenine ring, and the C3′-H···C4 interaction.

Scarano E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 4744Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The enzymes from all sources are oligomeric proteins with subunits ofM r 45,000–50,000. Each subunit contains one mole of tightly bound NAD+ (2Fujioka M. Takata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1631-1635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is reversible, and the equilibrium lies far in the direction of AdoHcy synthesis. Under physiological conditions, however, the removal of both Ado and Hcy is sufficiently rapid that the net reaction proceeds in the direction of hydrolysis (3Richards H.H. Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4476-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ado is removed by Ado deaminase and Ado kinase, and Hcy is used for the synthesis of cysteine and the regeneration of methionine. In mammals, Hcy is produced solely from AdoHcy, and it has been reported that an elevated plasma Hcy level is one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease (4Nygard O. Nordrehaug J.E. Refsum H.

On the basis of crystal structures of rat liver AdoHcyase (rWT) and rD244E:Ado* (3-keto-adenosine) determined in our laboratory, we have proposed a detailed catalytic mechanism (7Komoto J. Huang Y.

The substrate-free enzyme takes mainly an open conformation. Once the substrate enters the active site, Asp-189 that hydrogen bonds to the ε-NH3+ of Lys-185 moves away, taking a proton from the Lys residue. The catalytic domain closes a large cavity between it and the NAD-binding domain by rotating 17° around the molecular hinge section so that the substrate is brought closer to the bound NAD+. The resultant neutral Lys-185 and the bound NAD+ remove protons from 3′-OH and 3′-CH, respectively. Subsequently, the 4′-CH proton is abstracted by Asp-130. The resulting carbanion then releases H2O/Hcy to form the 3′-keto-4′, 5′-dehydroadenosine intermediate. AdoHcy is a potent inhibitor ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferases (8Hurwitz J. Gold M. Anders M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3474-3482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Deguchi T. Barchas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3175-3181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Coward J.K.

Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 828-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because AdoHcyase is the only enzyme involved in AdoHcy metabolism, and because the reaction it catalyzes is reversible, the activity of AdoHcyase is thought to play a critical role in the control of tissue levels of AdoHcy and hence to modulate the activities of various methyltransferases (13Cantoni G.L. Borchardt R.T. Creveling C.R. Ueland P.M. Biological Methylation and Drug Design. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1986: 227-238Crossref Google Scholar). Inhibition of AdoHcyase in vivoelevates the AdoHcy level, and consequently the AdoMet-dependent transmethylation is suppressed. Therefore, AdoHcyase has been an attractive target for the design of antiviral agents because most viruses require a methylated cap structure at the 5′-terminus of their mRNA for viral replication (Ref. 14Banerjee A.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1980; 44: 175-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein and Ref. 15Morch M.-D. Joshi R.L. Denial T.M. Haenni A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4123-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the virus-encoded methyltransferases that are involved in the formation of this methylated cap structure are inhibited by AdoHcy. A number of inhibitors of AdoHcyase have been identified. These are classified into two groups. One group includes Ado or 3-deazaadenosine analogues with carbocyclic ribose moieties such as aristeromycin (16Guranowski A. Montgomery J.A. Cantoni G.L. Chiang P.K.

Cyclic sugar Ado analogues, including mechanism-based inhibitors, are oxidized by the bound NAD+, and thus the inhibited AdoHcyase contains NADH rather than NAD+ in the active site. On the other hand, most acyclic sugar Ado analogues except for DEA are relatively weak reversible inhibitors. DEA is a potent inhibitor of AdoHcyase (IC50 = 7 nm) and is believed to be an inactivator of AdoHcyase (31Schanche J.-S. Schanche T. Ueland P.M. Holy A. Votruba I. Mol. Pharmcol. 1984; 26: 553-558PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Scheme FS1, the chiral centers (C2′ and C3′) of DEA have opposite chirality to those of Ado and cyclic sugar Ado analogues. Therefore, if the adenine ring of DEA binds to the enzyme in a similar fashion as observed in the structures of rD244E:Ado* and hWT:ADC, the acyclic sugar moiety must have quite a different interaction with the enzyme. To elucidate the binding scheme of DEA, we have determined the crystal structures of rWT inhibited by DEA and pure sodium DEA salt and analyzed the oxidation state of the bound NAD cofactor by UV measurement. Here we report why DEA is a potent inhibitor of AdoHcyase despite having an acyclic sugar moiety. The enzyme crystals of rWT and rWT:DEA were washed with 30% PEG 4000 solution and were subsequently dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer. The proteins were denatured by adding two volumes of absolute ethanol. The precipitates were washed once with 70% ethanol, and the combined supernatants were driedin vacuo. The residues were dissolved in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.2) and analyzed by UV absorption spectrometry using a JASCO V560 spectrophotometer. The spectra of rWT and rWT:DEA gave 0.038 and 0.042 absorbances at 260 nm, respectively. Absorption spectra of 1.0 μm concentrations of NAD+ + DEA (1:1) and NADH + DEA (1:1) were also recorded for references. The absorbances at 260 nm were 0.037 and 0.046, respectively, indicating that the concentrations of the extractions and the references were similar. Sodium DEA (Na+·[C9H10N5O4]−·2.5H2O) was provided by the Tanabe Research Laboratory (San Diego, CA) and was recrystallized from aqueous solution. A colorless plate-shaped crystal of dimensions 0.43 × 0.40 × 0.04 mm was selected for structural analysis. X-ray diffraction data for this compound were collected using a Bruker SMART APEX CCD area detector using graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data were collected in the range 3.57 < θ < 30.50° at −173 °C (0.70-Å resolution). Coverage of unique data was 99.8% complete to 26.0° in θ. The unit cell parameters (a = 7.873(1), b = 8.363(1),c = 20.557(1) Å, β = 97.99(1)°) were determined from a least squares fit of 4542 reflections. From 117 reflections that were measured both at the beginning and end of data collections, the crystal showed no decay during the data measurement. The data were corrected for absorption by a semiempirical method from equivalent reflections giving minimum and maximum transmission factors of 0.9342 and 0.9936. Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied. The data were merged to form a set of 3799 independent data with R(int) = 0.0131. The space group C2 was determined by systematic absences in the data. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least squares methods onF o2. The absolute configuration of the molecule was determined by using the anomalous dispersion effects from sodium and oxygen atoms in the crystal. Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal factors, whereas hydrogen atoms were refined with isotropic thermal factors. A total of 195 parameters were refined against the 3799 data to givewR(F o2) = 0.0923 andS = 1.062. The finalR(F o) was 0.0342 for the 3735 observed data (Fo > 4ς(Fo)). The coordinates have been deposited in the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (deposition number CCDC 171285). AdoHcyase used in this study is the recombinant rat enzyme produced in Escherichia coli JM109 transformed with a pUC118 plasmid that contains the coding sequence of rat AdoHcyase cDNA (32Gomi T.

The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from E. coli extracts by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-300 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (32Gomi T. Date T. Ogawa H. Fujioka M.

Recombinant AdoHcyase lacks the N-terminal acetyl group but exhibits other structural features similar to those of the liver enzyme (32Gomi T. Date T. Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Aksamit R.R. Backlund P.S. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16138-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hanging-drop vapor diffusion method was employed for crystallization of the enzyme. All crystallization experiments were conducted at 22 °C. Small crystals of the enzyme were grown for 1 week in a solution containing 1 mm sodium DEA, 22% (w/v) PEG 4000, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and 10% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The plate-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction (∼0.3 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm) were grown for 3 weeks. A crystal with dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm in a hanging drop was scooped out with a nylon loop and dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and 15% (w/v) PEG 4000 for 30 s before it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen crystal was transferred onto a Rigaku RAXIS IIc imaging plate x-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode x-ray generator as an x-ray source (CuKα radiation operated at 50 kV and 100 mA). The diffraction data were measured up to 3.0 Å resolution at −180 °C. The unit cell dimensions and the space group were uniquely determined from the observed data set. The data were processed with the program DENZO and SCALEPACK (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar).

The unit cell dimensions and the assigned space group indicated two tetrameric enzymes (eight subunits) in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using X-PLOR (34Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the structure of the D244E mutant enzyme (closed conformation) (7Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32147-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were used as search models. The closed structure model gave significantly better Patterson correlation-refinement results than the open structure model (i.e. the best refined Patterson correlation values of the closed and open structure models were 0.2418 and 0.1297, respectively). At this stage, the open structure model was abandoned. The crystal structure was refined by a standard refinement procedure in the X-PLOR protocol (34Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven and London1993Google Scholar) with the noncrystallographic symmetry restraint. During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (F o − F c maps) showed a large significant residual electron density peak in the region of the active site of each subunit. The shape of the electron density peak suggested that each individual subunit contains DEA. Initially the DEA molecule found in the crystal structure of sodium DEA was placed into the electron density peak in each subunit. The DEA molecule fit well into the electron density peak except for its O3′-hydroxyl group and C4′-carboxyl group. Once the torsion angle of the C2′−C3′ bond was changed from gauche − to transconformation (−60° → 180°), these two groups also fit into the electron density peak. All eight subunits were tightly restrained to have the similar conformation (i.e. rmsd < 0.09 Å). Refinement of isotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out by the individual B-factor refinement procedure of X-PLOR (34Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven and London1993Google Scholar) using bond and angle restraints. During the final refinement stage, well defined residual electron density peaks in difference maps were assigned to water molecules if peaks were able to bind the protein molecules with hydrogen bonds. The final crystallographic R-factor was 0.208 for all data (2 ς cut off) from 8.0 to 3.0 Å resolution. TheR free for 10% randomly selected data is 0.265. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code number 1K0U). The UV absorption spectra of the ethanol extract of rWT:DEA crystals and of a pure NAD+:DEA (1:1) solution are very similar. The characteristic peak around 340 nm from NADH is not observed, indicating that the rWT:DEA crystals contain NAD+ rather than NADH, and thus the bound DEA is not oxidized by the bound NAD+. The crystal structure of sodium DEA hydrate (Na+·[C9H10N5O4]−·2.5H2O) has been determined at 0.7 Å resolution (Fig.1). The DEA molecule has a semiring-forming conformation. The torsion angles of the N9–C1′, C1′–C2′, and C3′–C4′ bonds in the C8–N9–C1′–C2′–C3′–C4′ chain are −110°, −165°, and −64°, respectively. A sodium ion coordinates to three oxygen atoms (O2′, O3′, O4a'). All nitrogens and oxygens participate in hydrogen bonding either as H-bond donors or H-bond acceptors. The adenine rings are stacked on top of each other with hydrophobic interactions. The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table I), final (2F o − F c) maps, and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicate that the crystal structure of rWT:DEA has been successfully determined. The crystal contains two crystallographically independent tetrameric AdoHcyase molecules where each subunit of the tetrameric AdoHcyase molecule is related by 222 symmetry. Because the eight subunits are identical at a resolution of 3.0 Å, they have been tightly restrained to have the same structure (rmsd ≤ 0.09 Å) to increase the quality of the structure. The quality of the structure is even higher, although it was obtained at a moderate resolution. The AdoHcyase structure found in the rWT:DEA complex is very similar to those found in rD244E:Ado* and hWT:ADC complexes, although the rWT:DEA, rD244E:Ado*, and hWT:ADC complexes were crystallized in different crystal systems. The rmsd values between the Cα positions of the subunits of rWT:DEA and rD244E:Ado* and between those of rWT:DEA and hWT:ADC are 0.67 Å and 0.49 Å, respectively. The substrate-binding site is remarkably similar to those of the NADH-bound enzymes, indicating that the oxidation state of NAD does not affect the active site geometry. Furthermore, the geometry of the substrate-binding site is not changed by the binding of quite differently shaped molecules, indicating that the substrate-binding site is quite rigid. The complexed structures along the rWT structure indicate that the open-closed conformational change depends upon the substrate/inhibitor binding to the enzyme and not the NAD+/NADH oxidation state. The DEA molecule in the protein has an extended conformation and the torsion angles of the backbone chain, C8–N9–C1′–C2′–C3′–C4′, are −120°, 180°, and 180° for N9–C1′, C1′–C2′ and C2′–C3′ bonds, respectively (Fig.1 B). All oxygen atoms (O2′, O3′, O4a′, O4b′) participate in hydrogen bonding with the protein (Fig.2 A). The 3′-CH hydrogen is pointed toward C4 of NAD+ at a distance of 2.7 Å, indicating a weak interaction with the bound NAD+ molecule. The adenine ring of DEA binds at the same site as observed in the rD244E:Ado* and hWT:ADC structures. All nitrogen atoms except for N3 are involved in hydrogen bonding. The –CH2–S–CH3 moiety of Met-357 lies on the adenine ring. The bound NAD+ molecule has a similar conformation as the NAD+ molecule in the rWT structure and NADH molecules in the rD244E:Ado* and hWT:ADC structures. The NAD+ molecule is tightly bound to the protein with the similar interactions as seen in the rD244E:Ado* and hWT:ADC structures. Four crystal structures of AdoHcyase, including the one in this study, have been determined (7Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 5: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Each structure represents a different conformation of the AdoHcyase structure. The structure of the substrate-free rWT, which has a large open cleft between the NAD-binding domain and the catalytic domain, represents an open conformation structure of the enzyme (36Hu Y. Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The bound NAD is in an oxidized state (i.e. NAD+). The rD244E:Ado* structure contains a trapped Ado intermediate (Ado*, i.e.3-keto-adenosine) in the active site and a reduced NAD (i.e.NADH) (7Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32147-32156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cleft between the NAD-binding domain and the catalytic domain is closed (closed conformation). The structure of hWT:ADC contains the oxidized inhibitor (i.e. the inhibitor ADC is oxidized to 2′-hydroxy-3′-keto-cyclopenten-4′-yl-adenine) and NADH (38Turner M.A. Yuan C.S. Borchardt R.T. Hershfield M.S. Smith G.D. Howell P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The enzyme has a closed conformation. The rWT:DEA structure in this study has a closed conformation but contains unmodified DEA and NAD+. By comparing the rWT:DEA structure with the other AdoHcyase structures, several unique features of DEA and AdoHcyase have been revealed. The adenine rings of the substrate and the inhibitors bind at the same site with the same interactions. All the nitrogen atoms except for N3 are involved in hydrogen bonding with the protein as either a hydrogen bond acceptor or a hydrogen bond donor. It is noted that 3-deazaadenosine analogues bind to the protein as strongly as Ado analogues (39Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. Bader J.P. Shannon W.M. Thomas H.J. Montgomery J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonding apparently recognizes the adenine moiety of Ado/AdoHcy. Such an adenine recognition scheme would allow various compounds having adenine rings to bind to the active site of AdoHcyase. On the other hand, other nucleoside analogues such as compounds having guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine rings would be limited in their ability to bind to AdoHcyase. The ribose-binding site is composed of relatively hydrophilic amino acid residues. Therefore, the hydrogen-bonding capability of the sugar moiety determines the binding strength of Ado analogues, i.e. if an Ado analogue's sugar moiety is able to make many hydrogen bonds to the protein, then the molecule can bind tightly to the protein. Several different hydrogen bond networks are possible depending on the structure of the sugar moiety. As shown in Fig. 1, the DEA structures in the crystal and in the protein are superimposable except for O3′, C4′, O4a′, and O4b′, but the torsion angles of C2′–C3′ bonds are significantly different (−64° versus 180°). Indeed, the structure of the DEA molecule found in the crystal did not fit into the residual electron density peak in the active site. This observation indicates that the C2′–C3′ bond is twisted by −120° after a sodium ion is released. The carboxyl group of DEA in the crystal structure interacts strongly with a sodium ion. In the protein structure, the carboxyl group hydrogen bonds to the positively charged Lys-185. As illustrated in Scheme FS1, the chiralities of C2′ and C3′ of DEA are different from those of Ado and ADC. Nevertheless all of these compounds bind tightly to AdoHcyase. As shown in Fig.3, the hydrogen-bonding schemes of the sugar moiety are quite different. The 2′-OH of DEA hydrogen bonds exclusively to Asp-189, whereas that of Ado hydrogen bonds to Asp-189 and Glu-155. The 3′-OH of DEA hydrogen bonds solely to Asp-130, whereas that of Ado involves a hydrogen bond to Lys-185. Roughly speaking, O2′, O3′, and O4a′ of DEA are positioned at the O2′, C4′, and O3′ sites of Ado*, respectively. Except for two histidine residues (His-54 and His-300), all hydrophilic amino acid residues on the active site surface are involved in hydrogen bonding with DEA. Interestingly the 3′-CH hydrogen of DEA points to C4 of the bound NAD+ with a distance of C3′···C4 = 3.7 Å. However, the bound DEA is not oxidized by the bound NAD+. It is noted that the C3′···C4 distance in the rD244E:Ado* structure is 3.3 Å. In the rWT:DEA complex, the oxidation reaction does not occur because there is no strong nucleophilic group near the hydrogen of 3′-OH. We have proposed that the hydrogen of 3′-OH of Ado/AdoHcy is abstracted by the neutral Lys-185. When the catalytic domain of the rWT:DEA structure is superimposed on that of the rWT structure (open conformation structure), and the DEA molecule in rWT:DEA is placed in the rWT structure, the introduced DEA molecule can make all the hydrogen bonds to AdoHcyase that are observed in the rWT:DEA structure (Fig. 2 B). This simple modeling indicates that DEA can bind to the active site of the open conformation and can make most of the hydrogen bonds with the protein observed in the rWT:DEA complex. In comparison to rD244E:Ado*, DEA is involved in more hydrogen bonding than Ado* because DEA has more hydrogen bond-forming oxygens than Ado*. Once the catalytic reaction occurs (i.e.Ado is converted to 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine), only the 2′-OH and 3′-O of Ado* can participate in hydrogen bonding with AdoHcyase, whereas all four oxygens (2′-OH, 3′-OH, 4′-OH, and 4′-O) of DEA are involved in hydrogen bonding. Therefore, it appears that DEA binds to AdoHcyase more tightly than the substrate Ado does. When the enzyme closes the cleft between the catalytic domain and the NAD-binding domain, the bound DEA is buried within the protein body and cannot easily leave the active site. The DEA-mediated hydrogen bond networks between the catalytic domain and the NAD-binding domain apparently stabilize the closed structure. In the closed structure, the backbone of His-352 participates in hydrogen bonding with DEA (N6···O (His-352) = 3.3 Å; N7···N (His-352) = 3.0 Å), whereas in the open structure, His-352 is too far away to make hydrogen bonds with DEA (N6···O (His-352) = 5.7 Å; N7···N (His-352) = 5.2 Å). Similarly, 3′-CH hydrogen of DEA points to C4 of NAD+ and has an interaction with it (C3′···C4 = 3.7 Å) in the closed structure, whereas in the open structure 3′-CH hydrogen is too far to have an interaction with C4 of NAD+ (C3′···C4 = 6.8 Å). Therefore, the modeling indicates that the hydrogen bonds between the adenine ring and the backbone of His-352 and the C3′-H···C4 interaction are the major forces (through this lock mechanism) that stabilize the closed conformation of AdoHcyase. DEA is a very potent inhibitor because it can fit into the active site of the intact AdoHcyase (i.e. open conformation), it can make all possible hydrogen bonds with the protein, and it has a lock mechanism to stabilize the closed conformation structure. Once DEA binds to AdoHcyase and stabilizes the closed conformation, the reverse process would be very slow. Therefore, DEA behaves as an inactivator of AdoHcyase, but DEA is a reversible inhibitor because the bound DEA is intact. On the basis of the rWT:DEA structure, we can design specific inhibitors of AdoHcyase. As discussed above, Ado analogues could bind not only to AdoHcyase but also to various nucleotide/nucleoside-binding proteins (such as ATP-, ADP-, and AMP-binding proteins, Ado kinase, and Ado deaminase) and would disrupt their biological functions. Therefore, it is important to modify Ado analogues to bind solely to AdoHcyase and not to other nucleotide/nucleoside-binding proteins. There are three pieces of useful structural information. First, in the rWT:DEA, rD244E:Ado*, and hWT:ADC structures, N3 of the adenine ring is not involved in any hydrogen bonding, and there is a relatively large space in front of N3 that is large enough to put an –H or –O. Replacing the adenine ring with a 3-deazaadenine ring or adenine-3-oxide ring would severely limit the analogue's ability to bind to some nucleotide/nucleoside-binding proteins, i.e.3-deazaadenosine and adenosine-3-oxide analogues would have higher inhibitory selectivity than unmodified Ado analogues. Secondly, the 2′-OH and 3′-OH of DEA participate in hydrogen bonding with the negatively charged carboxyl groups of Asp-189 and Asp-130, respectively. Substituting the hydroxyl groups with positively charged amino groups would increase the binding affinity due to a charge-charge interaction. However, it is noted that introducing a charge-carrying amino group would reduce its membrane diffusion rate. Thirdly, there is a large open space on the tip of the carboxyl group in the rWT:DEA structure. Because a carboxylic acid ester would diffuse into cells faster than the carboxylic acid itself, formation of an ester with short chain monohydroxyl alcohols would improve the inhibitory activityin vivo. By considering these three factors, certain compounds are predicted to be potent and selective reversible inhibitors of AdoHcyase; these compounds are displayed below in Scheme 2.

Schanche et al. (31Schanche J.-S. Schanche T. Ueland P.M. Holy A. Votruba I. Mol. Pharmcol. 1984; 26: 553-558PubMed Google Scholar) have characterized the AdoHcyase inhibitory activity of acyclic Ado analogues (DEA, l-eritadenine,l-threoeritadenine, and 9-(S)-(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)adenine). They have found that DEA is a potent inhibitor, whereas the others are moderate inhibitors. The acyclic Ado inhibitors were placed in the active site by superimposing their adenine rings on that of DEA and changing the backbone conformational angles of their acyclic sugar to maximize the number of hydrogen bonds with the protein. The moderate inhibitors can form fewer hydrogen bonds than can DEA, suggesting that the observed inhibitory activities by Schanche et al. (31Schanche J.-S. Schanche T. Ueland P.M. Holy A. Votruba I. Mol. Pharmcol. 1984; 26: 553-558PubMed Google Scholar) are quite consistent with the rWT:DEA structure. Okumura et al. (40Okumura K. Matsumoto K. Fukamizu M. Yasuo H. Taguchi Y. Sugihara Y. Inoue I.

Chem. 1974; 17: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) have synthesized more than 100 derivatives of DEA because DEA has a significant hypocholesterolemic activity (40Okumura K. Matsumoto K. Fukamizu M. Yasuo H. Taguchi Y. Sugihara Y. Inoue I. Seto M. Sato Y. Takamura N. Kanno T. Kawazu M. Mizuguchi T. Saito S. Takashima K. Takeyama S. J. Med.

They have found that the carboxylic acid ester analogues with short chain monohydroxyl alcohols are 50 times more active than DEA and effective in lowering serum cholesterol of rats at the dose of 0.0001% in the diet. The intact adenine, the carboxyl functional group, and at least one hydroxyl group are essential for hypocholesterolemic activity. Although no direct correlation has been reported between the hypocholesterolemic activity and the AdoHcyase inhibitory activity of DEA, the findings by Okumura et al.(40Okumura K. Matsumoto K. Fukamizu M. Yasuo H. Taguchi Y. Sugihara Y. Inoue I. Seto M. Sato Y. Takamura N. Kanno T. Kawazu M. Mizuguchi T. Saito S. Takashima K. Takeyama S. J. Med. Chem. 1974; 17: 846-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) are consistent with the DEA binding mode to AdoHcyase found in this study. It is necessary to accumulate more data to conclude whether it is the AdoHcyase inhibitory activity of DEA that lowers the serum cholesterol. We thank Professor Richard H. Himes for critical reading of this manuscript and very valuable comments and Tanabe Research Laboratory for providing DEA."

BLV is closely related to human T-lymphotropic viruses HTLV-I and -II. The majority of BLV-infected cattle are asymptomatic carriers of the virus. Only about 30% of BLV-infected animals develop a preneoplastic condition termed persistent lymphocytosis, with 2–5% developing B-cell leukemia and/or lymphoma after a long latency period. The virus can be experimentally transmitted to sheep, in which it causes similar pathologies, providing a helpful model to understand BLV and HTLV-induced leukemogenesis. BLV infection is characterized by viral latency in the large majority of infected cells and by the absence of viremia. These features are thought to be due to the transcriptional repression of viral expression in vivo (7Kettmann R. Cleuter Y. Mammerickx M. Meunier-Rotival M. Bernardi G. Burny A. Chantrenne H. Proc.

The latency is likely to be a viral strategy to escape the host immune response and allow tumor development. BLV transcription initiates at the unique promoter located in the 5′-long terminal repeat (5′-LTR) of the BLV genome. The 5′-LTR is composed of the U3, R, and U5 regions and transcription initiates at the U3-R junction. The U3 region contains the main sites that regulate viral transcription (Fig. 1) as follows: the promoter CAAT and TATA boxes (10Derse D. Casey J.W.

Among the most important sites are three copies of an imperfectly conserved 21-bp sequence harboring in the middle a common 8-bp core sequence known as the cAMP-responsive element (CRE). At least three proteins, CRE-binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factors-1 and -2 (ATF-1 and ATF-2), bind to these 21-bp enhancers in bovine B-lymphocytes, and the amount of generated complex correlates with the level of viral expression (18Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Kettmann R. Burny A. Droogmans L. Willems L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5845-5853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Adam E. Kerkhofs P. Mammerickx M. Burny A. Kettman R. Willems L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 21-bp enhancers are also called Tax-responsive elements (TxREs) because transactivation of the BLV LTR by the virus-encoded transcriptional activator TaxBLV requires these enhancers. Because there is no evidence for direct binding of TaxBLV to DNA (20Derse D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that TaxBLV activation of transcription could be mediated, as reported for the HTLV system, through increased binding of the cellular proteins CREB, ATF-1, and ATF-2 (and possibly other factors yet to be identified) to the TxREs. Each of the 21-bp enhancers also contains an E box-homologous motif overlapping the CRE (Fig. 1). From 5′ to 3′, these E boxes are referred to as E-box1, E-box2 and E-box3, respectively (5Willems L.

An interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-binding site in U5 interacts with IRF-1 and IRF-2 and stimulates viral gene expression in the absence of TaxBLV (22Kiermer V. Van Lint C. Briclet D. Vanhulle C.

The presence of a 64-bp downstream activator sequence (DAS) at the 3′ end of the R region has been reported (10Derse D. Casey J.W.

To date however, no transcription factor-binding site has been identified in the R region. In this report, the sequence analysis of the BLV R region revealed the presence of a potential E box site (hereafter referred to as E-box4), 5′-CACGTG-3′ (nt +173 to +178), that conforms to the core hexanucleotide consensus sequence of an E box motif, CANNTG. E box sites bind proteins that belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, including c-Myc, Max, USF, or TFE3 (reviewed in Refs. 24Littlewood T.D. Evan G.I. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 621-702PubMed Google Scholar, 25Atchley W.R. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 26Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). bHLH proteins contain a basic (b) DNA binding domain and a helix-loop-helix (HLH) dimerization domain; the latter allows these proteins to interact and to form homo- and/or heterodimers. In the case of bHLH-ZIP-related proteins, the bHLH domain is contiguous with a second dimerization domain, a leucine zipper (ZIP), characterized by heptad repeats of leucines that occur immediately C-terminal to the bHLH motif. Precise DNA-binding site selection by individual bHLH family members is determined both by the central dinucleotide contained in the core hexamer sequence and by the flanking nucleotides (27Beckmann H.

The objective of the present study was to characterize physically and functionally the E-box4 motif located in the BLV R region. We performed competition and supershift gel shift assays with nuclear extracts prepared either from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a BLV-infected sheep or nuclear extracts from the human B-lymphoid cell line Raji. We demonstrated that the bHLH transcription factors USF1 and USF2 specifically interacted with the E-box4. A 2-bp mutation (central CG to TA) and another 2-bp mutation (3′ TG to GA) abrogated USF binding. To assess the transcriptional regulatory function of the E-box4, we tested the effect of these 2-bp mutations by transient transfection of B-lymphoid cell lines in the context of an LTR-luciferase reporter construct in presence or absence of a TaxBLV expression vector. Both mutations caused a reproducible 25% decrease in LTR-driven basal gene expression, indicating a positive functional role of the E-box4 motif in R. Ectopically expressed USF1 and USF2a proteins had an E-box4-dependent stimulatory effect on both the homologous BLV promoter and a heterologous thymidine kinase (TK) promoter containing multiple upstream E-box4 motifs. Mutation in the E-box4 impaired the responsiveness of the BLV promoter to TaxBLVbut not to other activators known to up-regulate BLV expression (overexpression of CREB2, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV), or CREB2/CaMKIV and treatment with PMA/ionomycin). Moreover, mutation in the E-box4 in combination with a mutation in the IRF site in U5 decreased the LTR basal activity more than 2-fold. The identification of the E-box4 motif represents the first transcription factor-binding site reported in the R region of BLV. The animal used in this study was a BLV-seropositive adult sheep (M298) affected with persistent lymphocytosis, presenting a persistently elevated lymphocyte count and an inverted B/T-lymphocyte ratio. This sheep was housed at the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Center (Uccle, Belgium). Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture, mixed with EDTA as an anticoagulant, and centrifuged at 1750 × g for 25 min at room temperature. The PBMCs were then isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation (density 1.129 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences) and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.075% EDTA, with centrifugation steps at 450 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (centrifugations at 200 × g for 10 min at room temperature) until the supernatant became clear. The Raji and Daudi cell lines are human B-lymphoid EBV-positive cell lines derived from Burkitt's lymphomas. The human epithelial HeLa cell line is derived from a cervical carcinoma and is transformed by human papilloma virus type 18. All media, sera (Myoclone Superplus), and supplements were from Invitrogen. Raji cells were grown in RPMI 1640-Glutamax I medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. Daudi cells were maintained in RPMI 1640-Glutamax I medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmHEPES buffer, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-Glutamax I medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin/ml. All cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The BLV LTR used in this study is the 344 provirus described by Sagata et al. (41Sagata N. Yasunaga T. Tsuzuku-Kawamura J. Ohishi K. Ogawa Y. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The first nucleotide of R and the last nucleotide of U3 are considered +1 and −1, respectively. To construct the luciferase reporter plasmid pLTRwt-luc, we used PCR to amplify the BLV promoter region from a 344 wild-type (wt) plasmid (a kind gift from Dr. Luc Willems).SmaI sites were introduced into the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers, and the SmaI-restricted PCR fragment was cloned in pGL3-BASIC (Promega) digested with SmaI. The 5′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt −211 to −182 contained an addedSmaI site (in bold) at the 5′ end (5′-TCCCCCGGGTnt−211GTATGAAAGATCATGCCGGCCTAGGCGCC-3′). The 3′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt +291 to +320 contained an added SmaI site (in bold) at the 5′end (5′-TCCCCCGGGTnt+320GTTTGCCGGTCTCTCCTGGCCGCTAGAGG-3′). Amplification reaction was conducted with 100 ng of template plasmid DNA as specified in the protocol provided with the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a DNA thermal cycler 480 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting plasmid was designated pLTRwt-luc. This construct was used as a substrate for mutagenesis by the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Different mutations were generated with the following pairs of mutagenic oligonucleotide primers (mutations are highlighted in bold and E box or IRF motifs are underlined on the coding strand primer): CV192/193 (E-box4-mutA), 5′-CCTCTGACCGTCTCCATATGGACTCTCTCTC-3′; CV262/265 (E-box4-mutB), 5′-ACCGTCTCCACGGAGACTCTCT-3′; CV311/312 (IRFmut), 5′-GTTTCCTGTCTTACAGTCTGTGTCTCGCGGCCCGCG-3′; CV194/195 (Eboxes1,2-mutA), 5′-GACAGAGACGTCATATGCCAGAAAAGCTGGTGACGGCATATGGTGGCTAGAATCC-3′; CV281/282 (Eboxes1,2mutB), 5′-GACAGAGACGTCAGCGACCAGAAAAGCTGGTGACGGCAGCGAGTGGCTAGAATCC-3′; CV196/197 (E-box3-mutA), 5′-GAGCTGCTGACCTCATATGCTGATAAAACAATAA-3′; and CV283/284 (E-box3-mutB), 5′-GAGCTGCTGACCTCACCGACTGATAAAACAATAA-3. Mutated constructs were fully resequenced after identification by cycle sequencing using the Thermosequenase DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences). Three mutated plasmids were designated pLTR(E-box4-mutA)-luc, pLTR(E-box4-mutB)-luc, and pLTR(IRF-mut)-luc. Four constructs containing combinations of mutations were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using simultaneously two or three of the mutagenic oligonucleotide pairs described above. These plasmids were generated by combining CV194/195-CV196/197, CV281/282-CV283/284, CV192/193-CV194/195-CV196/197, and CV262/265-CV281/282-CV283/284 and were designated pLTR(E-box1,2,3-mutA)-luc, pLTR(E-box1,2,3-mutB)-luc, pLTR(E-box1,2,3,4-mutA)-luc, and pLTR(E-box1,2,3,4-mutB)-luc, respectively. In addition, pLTR(E-box4-mutA)-luc and pLTR(E-box4-mutB)-luc were used as substrates for site-directed mutagenesis using the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers CV311/312, thereby generating pLTR(E-box4-mutA/IRFmut)-luc and pLTR(E-box4-mutB/IRFmut)-luc, respectively. The pTK-luc reporter plasmid contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter and was generated by subcloning the SalI (position 417)-XhoI (position 597) fragment from pBLCAT2 (42Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 155490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar) into the XhoI-restricted pGL2-BASIC reporter plasmid (Promega). The p(E-box4)3TK-luc and p(E-box4)7TK-luc were generated by inserting three direct repeats in the forward orientation and seven direct repeats in the reverse orientation, respectively, of an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-ACCGTCTCCACGTGGACTCTCT-3′ (the BLV E-box4 motif is underlined) into SmaI-digested pTK-luc. Similarly, the two mutated versions, p(E-box4-mutA)3TK-luc and p(E-box4-mutB)3TK-luc, were generated by inserting three direct repeats in the forward orientation of an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-ACCGTCTCCATATGGACTCTCT-3′ and 5′-ACCGTCTCCACGGAGACTCTCT-3′ (mutations are highlighted in bold), respectively, intoSmaI-digested pTK-luc. In all these constructs, the multimerized wild-type or mutated E box motifs are thus positioned upstream of the TK promoter. To construct pGEM-LTRBLV used in RNase protection analysis, a 201-bp fragment containing the BLV 5′-LTR from position −118 to +83 was generated by PCR amplification of pLTRwt-luc. XbaI andPstI restriction sites were introduced into the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers, respectively, and theXbaI-PstI-restricted PCR fragment was cloned in pGEM-3Zf(+) vector (Promega) digested with XbaI andPstI. The 5′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt −118 to −87 contained an added XbaI site (inbold) at the 5′ end (5′-CGCTCTAGAGnt-118GCTAGAATCCCCGTACCTCCCCAACTTCCCC-3′). The 3′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt +55 to +83 contained an added PstI site (in bold) at the 5′ end (5′-GGTTTTCTGCAGCnt+83GGATAGCCGACCAGAAGGTCTCGGGAGC-3′). To construct the expression plasmid for ovine c-Myc, we used PCR to amplify the coding region of the ovine c-myc cDNA described in Kiermer et al. (43Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Masengo R. Cleuter Y. Briclet D. Ciesiolka M. Van den B.A. Willems L. Kettmann R. Burny A. Droogmans L. DNA Seq. 1997; 7: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). HindIII andBamHI restriction sites were introduced into the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers, respectively, and theHindIII-BamHI-restricted PCR fragment was cloned in pcDNA3.1 (+/−) vector (Invitrogen) digested withHindIII and BamHI. The 5′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt 203–226 (according to the ovine c-Myc cDNA sequence, GenBankTM accession number Z68501) contained an added HindIII site (in bold) at the 5′ end (5′-GCCCAAGCTTAnt203CCGCGATGCCCCTCAACGTCAGC-3′). The 3′ primer oligonucleotide corresponding to nt 1571–1598 contained an added BamHI site (in bold) at the 5′ end (5′-GCCGGATCCTnt1598CCTCACTTTCCCTTAGTAACAAATGAG-3′). The resulting plasmid was designated pcDNA3-cMyc. The eukaryotic expression vectors pSG-TAXBLV and pSG-CREB2 (44Willems L. Kettmann R. Chen G. Portetelle D. Burny A. Derse D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 766-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were gifts from Drs. Luc Willems and Richard Kettmann. The expression plasmid pCaMKIV was a gift from Dr. Anthony Means (45Sun Z. Means R.L. LeMagueresse B. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29507-29514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The USF1 and USF2a expression vectors (kindly provided by Drs. A. Kahn and M. Raymondjean) contained the human USF1 and USF2a cDNAs cloned in the pCR3 expression vector parent plasmid (Invitrogen) and were described previously (46Lefrancois-Martinez A.M. Martinez A. Antoine B. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2640-2643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Raji cells were transfected by using the DEAE-dextran procedure as described previously (47Van Lint C. Ghysdael J. Paras Jr., P. Burny A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2632-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested at density of 106/ml, washed with STBS (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 700 μm CaCl2, 500 μmMgCl2, 600 μmNa2PO4), and resuspended at a concentration of 6 × 106 in 600 μl of a mixture containing 500 ng of the pGL3-BASIC-derived constructs (with or without cotransfected DNAs) and 450 μg of DEAE-dextran (Amersham Biosciences)/ml in STBS. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed twice with STBS and once with culture medium, and grown in 3 ml of supplemented medium for 40–44 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). Luciferase activities derived from BLV LTRs were normalized with respect to protein concentrations using the Detergent-compatible Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Daudi cells were transfected by electroporation. Cells were harvested in exponential growth phase and resuspended in supplemented medium at a concentration of 5 × 106 per 400 μl. The 400 μl of cells were mixed with 8 μg of pGL3-BASIC-derived constructs and 50 ng of pRL-TK (Promega) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, transferred to electroporation vials, and electroporated at 250 V with a capacitance of 960 microfarads (by using a Bio-Rad gene pulser). Transfected cells were collected, plated out immediately in 4 ml of preheated medium (a 1:1 mixture of fresh culture medium and supernatant of a 24-h culture), and grown for 48 h at 37 °C. All transfection mixtures contained the pRL-TK, in which a cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase is under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter region and is used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 h post-transfection, luciferase activities (firefly andRenilla) were measured in cell lysates, and firefly luciferase activities derived from the BLV promoters were normalized with respect to the Renilla luciferase activity by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). HeLa cells were transfected using FuGENETM-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105cells/well in 6-well plates. FuGENETM-6 was added directly to serum-free medium 5 min prior to addition to the DNA. Hundred microliters of this FuGENETM-6/serum-free medium mix was added to the DNA mixture in microcentrifuge tubes. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and, finally, was added to each well of a 6-well plate. Transfected cells were grown in 2 ml of supplemented medium for 40–44 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega). Luciferase activities derived from BLV or TK promoters were normalized with respect to protein concentrations using the Detergent-Compatible Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Nuclear extracts were prepared by a rapid method described by Osborn et al. (48Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All buffers contained the protease inhibitors antipain (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (201652) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the coding strand of the double-stranded oligonucleotides used for this study are listed in Fig. 3 A or in the figure legends. EMSAs were performed as described previously (47Van Lint C. Ghysdael J. Paras Jr., P. Burny A. Verdin E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2632-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extract (4 μg of protein) was first incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the absence of probe and specific competitor DNA in a 16-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μg of DNase-free bovine serum albumin (Amersham Biosciences), 6 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) as nonspecific competitor DNA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 60 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Fifteen thousand cpm of probe (10–40 fmol) was then added to the mixture with or without a molar excess of an unlabeled specific DNA competitor, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis at room temperature on 6% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 2–3 h in 1× TGE buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 190 mmglycine, 1 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and autoradiographed for 24–48 h at −70 °C. For supershift assays, polyclonal antibodies against USF1 (sc-229), USF2 (sc-862), Max (sc-197), Mad-1 (sc-222), Mad-2 (sc-1720), Mad-3 (sc-933), Mad-4 (sc-771), c-Myc (sc-764), and Mnt (sc-769) (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, Santa Cruz, CA) were added at a final concentration of 2 μg/reaction to the binding reaction mixture at the end of the binding reaction for an additional 30 min incubation at room temperature before electrophoresis. In vitro translated Ebox-binding proteins Max, Mad1, and c-Myc were used in control EMSAs. These proteins were generated by using the TNT-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) with the pGEM expression plasmid encoding mouse Max (p22 long form), the pRC/CMV expression vector for human Mad1 (both kindly provided by Dr. S. Segal), and the pcDNA3 expression vector for ovine c-Myc, pcDNA3-cMyc. Eight μl of in vi"
https://openalex.org/W1977126501,"Bloom's syndrome is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder that combines a marked genetic instability and an increased risk of developing all types of cancers and which results from mutations in both copies of the BLM gene encoding a RecQ 3′-5′ DNA helicase. We recently showed that BLM is phosphorylated and excluded from the nuclear matrix during mitosis. We now show that the phosphorylated mitotic BLM protein is associated with a 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity and interacts with topoisomerase IIIα. We demonstrate that in mitosis-arrested cells, ionizing radiation and roscovitine treatment both result in the reversion of BLM phosphorylation, suggesting that BLM could be dephosphorylated through the inhibition of cdc2 kinase. This was supported further by our data showing that cdc2 kinase activity is inhibited in γ-irradiated mitotic cells. Finally we show that after ionizing radiation, BLM is not involved in the establishment of the mitotic DNA damage checkpoint but is subjected to a subcellular compartment change. These findings lead us to propose that BLM may be phosphorylated during mitosis, probably through the cdc2 pathway, to form a pool of rapidly available active protein. Inhibition of cdc2 kinase after ionizing radiation would lead to BLM dephosphorylation and possibly to BLM recruitment to some specific sites for repair.

The major cellular consequences of a BLM defect are an increase in homologous recombination and in the rate of widespread mutations. Indeed, BS cells display spontaneous hypermutability and several cytogenetic abnormalities including an increase in chromosome breaks, symmetric quadriradial chromatid interchanges between homologous chromosomes, and sister chromatid exchanges (for review, see Ref. 3German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Until recently, very little information was available about the physiological function of BLM. Now, several lines of evidences strongly support the involvement of BLM during DNA replication and in the cellular response to DNA damage. Recently, BLM protein has been shown to accumulate during the S phase of the cell cycle (4Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M.

These data prompted us to investigate further the possible role of BLM phosphorylation in mitosis. If BLM acts in mitosis-arrested cells in the same pathways as those described for exponentially growing cells, it could be involved in the cellular response to DNA damage. However, little is known about the cellular response to DNA damage in mitosis. Poon et al. (11Poon R.Y. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in mitosis-arrested cells, cdc2 kinase activity is inhibited by DNA damage. Very recently, Smits et al. (12Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) showed for the first time that responses to DNA damage in mammalian cells are not restricted to the interphase but also occur during mitosis through a mitotic DNA damage checkpoint that blocks the exit from mitosis.In the present study we show that in mitosis-arrested cells, the phosphorylated BLM protein is associated with 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity and interacts with topoisomerase IIIα. We present data demonstrating that mitotic BLM phosphorylation is reversed in response to ionizing radiation and also after treatment with roscovitine, which is known to inhibit cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity in mitosis-arrested cells. We also show that cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity is inhibited in mitosis-arrested cells subjected to ionizing radiation, suggesting that the BLM dephosphorylation that we observed in γ-irradiated mitotic cells could result in part from inhibition of cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity. Finally, we show that in response to ionizing radiation, BLM is not involved in the establishment of the DNA damage mitotic checkpoint but is transferred from a soluble to an insoluble protein fraction, suggesting that during mitosis, phosphorylation modulates the localization of BLM to specific subcellular compartments.Our observations led us to suggest that during mitosis, the phosphorylation of BLM protein, probably via the cdc2/cyclin B pathway, could disrupt its association with the nuclear matrix, allowing a pool of readily available active BLM protein to build up. In response to ionizing radiation, inhibition of cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity and activation of an as yet unidentified phosphatase(s) could lead to BLM dephosphorylation and possibly to BLM recruitment to some specific sites for repair.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsDemecolcine and nocodazole (Sigma) were resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide to stock concentrations of 0.26 mm and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, and used at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:4,000.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Helicase AssayConstruction of the Helicase SubstrateHelicase substrate was prepared by mixing a 5-ng oligonucleotide corresponding to fragment 6218–6251 of the single-stranded M13mp18(−) DNA with 1 μg of single-stranded M13mp18(+) DNA in the presence of 25 mmNaCl and 2.5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was heated for 2 min at 100 °C and cooled slowly to room temperature for 30 min to allow annealing of the DNA heteroduplex. After EcoRI digestion, substrate labeling was performed using 5 units of Klenow fragment in the presence of 0.1 mm dTTP and 70 μCi of 3,000 Ci/mmol [α32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After 20 min at 23 °C, 62.5 μm dATP was added to the reaction mixture, which was then incubated for another 20 min at 23 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the labeled substrate was purified on a gel filtration column.Assay MethodsThe DNA helicase assay buffer contains 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 5 mm ATP, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1–3 ng of labeled DNA substrate. Immunoprecipitates or purified TFIIH was incubated in 25 μl of helicase assay buffer for 45 min at 37 °C, and the assay was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of a buffer containing 20 mmEDTA, 0.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue. For immunoprecipitates, the supernatants were analyzed using a 14% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The remaining pellets containing immunocomplexes were boiled and subjected to Western blot analysis.The purified TFIIH fraction was kindly provided by Frédéric Coin (IGBMC, Illkirch, France) and used as described (14Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Western Blot AnalysisCells were cultured with or without drugs, scraped, and lysed in 1% SDS in water for 5 min at 95 °C and then sonicated. Samples equivalent to 5 × 105 cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis as described previously (4Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Ababou M. Dutertre S. Lécluse Y. Onclercq R. Chatton B. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).ImmunoprecipitationsCells were lysed by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0,5% Igepal Ca-630 (Sigma), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche) for 15 min at 4 °C. Membrane debris were eliminated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured by Coomassie protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce).For Helicase AssayImmunoprecipitations were performed using 1.5 mg of lysate for each point. Protein extracts were incubated with anti-BLM C18 or with irrelevant antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) was then added, and the incubation continued for another hour. The beads were recovered by low speed centrifugation and washed five times in 0.7 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Igepal Ca-630, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). For the helicase assay, four immunoprecipitates were pooled and washed twice with helicase assay buffer before the assay was performed.For CoimmunoprecipitationsImmunoprecipitations were performed using 3 mg of lysate for each point. Protein extracts were incubated with 1343, with D6, or with irrelevant antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads was then added, and the incubation continued for another hour. The beads were recovered by low speed centrifugation, washed five times in 0.7 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% Igepal Ca-630, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), and then divided into two fractions. Each fraction was loaded onto a 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Kinase AssayCells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP buffer: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 80 μm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated by stirring gently with monoclonal anti-cdc2 antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes bound to protein G-Sepharose were collected by centrifugation and washed once in IP buffer and three times in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mm MgCl2, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mmNa3PO4). The beads were then incubated with a kinase reaction mixture (5 μg of GST-Rb, 50 μmof cold ATP, and 5 μCi of 3,000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in the kinase assay buffer) in a total volume of 30 μl for 30 min at 30 °C with shaking (purified GST-Rb was kindly provided by Serge Leibovitch, UMR CNRS 1599, IGR, Villejuif). The reaction was stopped with the addition of 2× sample buffer to the reaction, and the reaction mixture was then heated to 90 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE before being transferred. The membrane was analyzed by autoradiography, and the amount of cdc2 protein in immunoprecipitates was then determined by probing the membrane with anti-cdc2 antibody.Radiation TreatmentCells were irradiated at room temperature with 50 or 100 Gy using a 137Cs γ source at a dose rate of 1.95 Gy/min. After irradiation, cells were grown at 37 °C for the indicated times.Nonidet P-40 ExtractionDemecolcine-treated HeLa cells (0.26 μm for 16 h) were γ-irradiated or not, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then resuspended in Nonidet P-40 buffer (15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.5 mm DTT, 300 mm sucrose, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche) containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40). After incubating for 3 min at room temperature, the samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was kept as the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction. The pellet, resuspended in solution P (20 mm Hepes, 10% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche)) and sonicated, constituted the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction.Immunofluorescence LabelingCells were transferred onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and fixed in 3.7% freshly prepared formaldehyde in PBS (15 min, room temperature). All subsequent steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After a wash in PBS, cells were blocked with a solution containing PBS, 0.1% Tween, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (1 h). After three washes in PBS, the slides were incubated with primary antibody (MPM-2) for 1 h. After being washed three times with PBS, the slides were incubated with the secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse IgG antiserum conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes in PBS, nuclear DNA staining was carried out by incubating with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole solution for 5 min (Sigma). Confocal fluorescent images were collected using a Leica TCS confocal system (Wetzler, Germany).DISCUSSIONThe striking feature of Bloom's syndrome is that it predisposes patients to all kinds of cancer that commonly affect the general population, which suggests that identification of the molecular basis of tumor development in BS patients could also help in deciphering of new pathways of carcinogenesis in the general population.We had shown previously that BLM protein is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis (4Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and the aim of the present study was to characterize further the possible role of this phosphorylation of mitotic BLM.We first showed that the mitotic BLM protein is associated with a 3′-5′ DNA helicase activity and interacts with topoisomerase IIIα, and this led us to wonder whether BLM could play a functional role during mitosis. Our previous work showing that in interphase cells, BLM participates in the cellular response to ionizing radiation (8Ababou M. Dutertre S. Lécluse Y. Onclercq R. Chatton B. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5955-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) led us to analyze the expression of mitotic BLM in response to ionizing radiation. We found that the mitotic BLM protein was dephosphorylated after ionizing radiation, suggesting that BLM could also be involved in the cellular response to DNA damage during mitosis. This was supported further by recent data showing that responses to DNA damage in mammalian cells are not restricted to the interphase but also occur during mitosis (12Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We therefore suggested that dephosphorylation of mitotic BLM protein could result in part from the inactivation of a kinase playing a major role in BLM phosphorylation during mitosis after exposure of the mitotic cells to ionizing radiation. The best candidate was the kinase p34cdc2 because it is known to phosphorylate a large number of proteins in mitosis and because BLM carries two potential phosphorylation sites that fit the consensus sequenceX-S/T-P-X-R/K for protein kinase p34cdc2 (18Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at positions 711–717 and 763–769, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the mitotic BLM protein is dephosphorylated by exposure to roscovitine, which further supports our hypothesis. Indeed, roscovitine displays high efficiency and selectivity toward cdc2/cyclin B kinase (19De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 20Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be useful for studying molecular events conducted through the cdc2/cyclin B pathway in mitosis-arrested cells (11Poon R.Y. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sirri V. Roussel P. Hernandez-Verdun D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Altogether, these results suggest that cdc2 kinase may play a key role in BLM phosphorylation during mitosis and indicate that cdc2 kinase activity could be inhibited after ionizing radiation.Inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity in response to DNA damage in mitosis is not well documented. It has been shown that exposing nocodazole-arrested cells to UV irradiation or adriamycin resulted in the loss of cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity (11Poon R.Y. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the data recently published by Smits et al. (12Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) showed that exposing nocodazole-arrested cells to adriamycin does not inhibit cdc2/cyclin B kinase activity and suggested similar effects after camptothecin or ionizing radiation treatment of mitotic cells. In the present study, we showed clearly that the cdc2 kinase activity was inhibited when mitosis-arrested cells were treated with ionizing radiation. These results resolve the controversy reported in the literature for at least one type of genotoxic stress and support our hypothesis that dephosphorylation of the mitotic BLM protein after ionizing radiation results, at least in part, from inactivation of cdc2 kinase. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity may depend on the type of DNA damage.Smits et al. (12Smits V.A. Klompmaker R. Arnaud L. Rijksen G. Nigg E.A. Medema R.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) show that exposure to γ-irradiation prevents exit from mitosis, possibly by inactivating the polo-like kinase-1. In confirming those results, we showed that exposing mitosis-arrested cells to ionizing radiation prevents the exit from mitosis in wild-type cells and also in BLM-deficient cells, demonstrating that BLM is not involved in the establishment of a mitotic DNA damage checkpoint of this type.Finally, we showed that all of the mitotic phosphorylated BLM is extracted in the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, whereas reversion of mitotic BLM phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation is concurrent with the relocalization of BLM in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. These findings confirm our previous results, showing that phosphorylation modifies the extractability of BLM during mitosis (4Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) but also demonstrate that the phosphorylation of BLM during mitosis modulates its subcellular localization.Our findings led us to propose a model for the phosphorylation of BLM during mitosis. BLM is phosphorylated during mitosis, probably via the cdc2 pathway. Exclusion of the mitotic phosphorylated BLM from the Nonidet P-40-insoluble cellular fraction containing proteins bound to chromatin and to the nuclear scaffold would avoid possible interference of BLM (and probably other proteins) with the mitotic process such as the condensation of chromosomes. However, the mitotic phosphorylated BLM protein is excluded from the insoluble cellular fraction, but is not degraded, and is maintained in an active form within the soluble cellular fraction. In response to ionizing radiation, BLM is dephosphorylated, probably as a result of the inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity and activation of yet unidentified phosphatase(s), and then recruited in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. This suggests that phosphorylation of BLM in mitotic cells allows its storage within a soluble cellular fraction, constituting a pool of active BLM proteins that can be recruited rapidly to some specific sites for repair purposes.In interphase cells, BLM localize to nuclear foci containing the promyelocytic leukemia protein (28Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Maul G.G. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that promyelocytic leukemia proteins assemble a matrix-based complex containing BLM and hRAD51, which functions as a recombinosome to repair spontaneous and induced double-strand breaks (9Bischof O. Kim S.H. Irving J. Beresten S. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in response to DNA damages, BLM could also be a part of such nuclear matrix-based complex during mitosis. This hypothesis is consistent with the concept proposed by Koehler and Hanawalt (30Koehler D.R. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2877-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), that a “repair factory” is located on the nuclear matrix where the DNA repair occurs, and with studies suggesting that the nuclear matrix may play a role in the repair of DNA double-strand-breaks (for review, see Ref. 31Roti Roti J.L. Wright W.D. VanderWaal R. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 343-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The BLM gene is located on chromosome 15 at 15q26.1 and encodes the BLM protein, which belongs to the DExH box-containing RecQ helicase subfamily (1Ellis N.A. Groden J., Ye, T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) and displays ATP- and Mg2+-dependent 3′-5′-DNA helicase activity (2Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The major cellular consequences of a BLM defect are an increase in homologous recombination and in the rate of widespread mutations. Indeed, BS cells display spontaneous hypermutability and several cytogenetic abnormalities including an increase in chromosome breaks, symmetric quadriradial chromatid interchanges between homologous chromosomes, and sister chromatid exchanges (for review, see Ref. 3German J. Medicine (Baltimore). 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Until recently, very little information was available about the physiological function of BLM. Now, several lines of evidences strongly support the involvement of BLM during DNA replication and in the cellular response to DNA damage. Recently, BLM protein has been shown to accumulate during the S phase of the cell cycle (4Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), to interact selectively in vitro with Holliday junctions (5Karow J.K. Constantinou A., Li, J.L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc.

BLM has also been shown to participate in the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (7Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J.

https://openalex.org/W2025941517,"KSR (kinase suppressor ofRas) has been proposed as a molecular scaffold regulating the Raf/MEK/ERK kinase cascade. KSR is phosphorylated on multiple phosphorylation sites by associated kinases. To identify potential mechanisms used by KSR to regulate ERK activation, green fluorescent protein was fused to intact and mutated KSR constructs lacking specific phosphorylation sites, and the subcellular distribution of each construct was observed in live cells. Mutation of a subset of KSR phosphorylation sites caused the redistribution of KSR to the nucleus. To determine whether intact KSR is normally imported to the nucleus, REF-52 fibroblasts expressing KSR were treated with 10 nm leptomycin B, which inhibits Crm1-dependent nuclear export. KSR accumulated in the nucleus within 2 h of treatment with leptomycin B, suggesting that KSR cycles continuously through the nucleus. Nuclear import of KSR was blocked by mutations that inhibit the interaction of KSR with MEK. Coexpression of fluorescent forms of KSR and MEK in cells revealed that each protein promoted the localization of the other in the cytoplasm. These data indicate that the subcellular distribution of KSR is dynamically regulated through phosphorylation and MEK interaction in a manner that may affect signaling through ERK.

Similar to ERKs, MEK translocates to the nucleus upon stimulation with mitogens or serum (28Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Evidence also suggests that MEK and ERK, rather than localizing exclusively to the cytoplasm in resting cells, are continuously cycling in and out of the nucleus (30Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 31Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Nuclear export of ERK involves a MEK-dependent active transport mechanism (32Li B.Y., Yu, H. Zheng W.P. Voll R., Na, S.Q. Roberts A.W. Williams D.A. Davis R.J. Ghosh S. Flavell R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 2219-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The ability of KSR to interact with Raf, MEK, and ERK and observations that loss-of-function mutations in KSR specifically disrupt KSR/MEK interaction raise the possibility that KSR may affect signaling through the MAPK cascade by altering the subcellular distribution of one or more signaling components. To better understand the mechanism by which KSR regulates the MAPK pathway, we used a GFP-KSR fusion protein to determine the subcellular distribution of KSR in live cells. We found that KSR was localized to the cytoplasm in quiescent cells, but, like MEK and ERK, continuously cycled through the nucleus. Mutations in KSR that altered its ability to bind MEK also inhibited nucleocytoplasmic transport of KSR. We also found that phosphorylation of KSR regulated its nucleocytoplasmic distribution, but did not impair its association with MEK. This study suggests a link between the ability of KSR to translocate to the nucleus, to bind MEK, and to regulate ERK activation. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C. 293T and REF-52 cells were grown in a 5% CO2atmosphere. The addition of the FLAG epitope tag to the COOH terminus of KSR and the construction of pCMV5KSR.R589M, pCMV5KSR.T411V, pCMV5KSR.S518A, pCMV5KSR.S392A, and pCMV5KSR.T274V were described previously (14Joneson T.

McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To create pCMV5KSR.S518A/T411V, pCMV5KSR.S518A and pCMV5KSR.T411V were digested with BstXI, and the appropriate fragments were ligated together. pCMV5KSR.T274V/T411V was created by digesting pCMV5KSR.T274V and pCMV5KSR.T411V with BamHI and ligating together. 4mut is S518A/T274V/S392A/T411V. 5mut adds S297A; 6mut adds S190A; and 9mut adds S320A, S429A, S430A, S431A, S434A, and S435A. These constructs were created as described previously (33Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). pCMV5KSR.C809Y was created using the method described above and primer 5′-GGCGAGATCCTGTCTGCATACTGGGCTTTCGATCTGC-3′ (deletes theBglI site). Using pCMV5KSR.9mut, Val274 was reverted to Thr using primer 5′-GCTGAAGCCACCAAGGACACCCCCACCGCC-3′ (deletes the created AvrII site) either singly or in combination with reversion of Ala392 to Ser using primer 5′-CGGAGGACAGAGTCTGTCCCGTCAGATATC-3′ (destroys the createdKpnI site) to create 9mutA392S, 9mutV274T, and 9mutV274T/A392S. The remaining double mutants were created by PCR mutagenesis using one mutant as a template for mutation of the second site. The GFP-KSR fusion constructs were created by digesting pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and the construct in pCMV5 with EcoRI and KpnI (wild-type KSR and R589M), XbaI (C809Y),BamHI (9mut), or SalI (T274V, S392A, S518A, T411V, S518A/S392A, T274V/S297A, T274V/S518A, S297A/S392A, S392A/T411V, 4mut, 5mut, 6mut, T274V/S392A, S518A/T411V, T274V/T411V, 9mutA392S, 9mutV274T, and 9mutV274T/A392S) and ligating the appropriate fragments together. The sequence PKKKRKV was fused to the carboxyl terminus of KSR, KSR.R589M, and KSR.C809Y using primer 5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGCCTAAGAAGAAGCGGAAGGTCGACTAGGGTACCGG-3′ (34Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The primer sequence contains a SalI restriction site for screening. The sequence of MEK1 was obtained by designing primers for PCR of the sequence from pcDNA1MEK1 (gift from Nick Grammatakakis), with enzyme sitesHindIII (5′-end) and BamHI (3′-end). MEK1 was then subcloned into pEYFP-C1 using HindIII/BamHI. To construct YFP-MEK1.ΔNES, the reported NES (amino acids 32–44) (28Jaaro H. Rubinfeld H. Hanoch T. Seger R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3742-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was deleted from YFP-MEK1 by PCR mutagenesis. The forward primer sequence (and its reverse complement) used was 5′-CAGCTCGGCCGAGACCAACCTGGAGCAGCAGCGGAAGCGGCTAGAGGCCTTTC-3′, and ALQKKLEELELDE (nucleotides 134–174) of MEK1 was deleted. TheXhoI site was deleted, and the absence of this site was used to identify the appropriate construct. The coding region for CFP was excised from the promoterless vector pECFP-1 and substituted for GFP in the pEGFP-C1 vector using the enzyme sites AgeI and BsrGI. CFP fusion proteins with KSR were constructed as described above to create GFP-KSR fusion proteins. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated cDNAs using calcium phosphate (33Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in transfection efficiencies in 293T cells near 90%. Activation of the ERK MAPK was achieved by transfection of constitutively active Raf (Raf-CAAX). The cells were lysed, and clarified cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-ERK1 and anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The ERK assay was performed using MBP as a substrate (14Joneson T. Fulton J.A. Volle D.J. Chaika O.V. Bar-Sagi D. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer and heating to 110 °C for 3 min and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel. Radiolabeled MBP was quantified using storage phosphor technology (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and Western blots were developed using anti-FLAG antibody M2 (1:2000; Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems), anti-c-Raf antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), anti-GFP antibody (1:500; CLONTECH), anti-MEK antibody (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories), or phospho-specific anti-ERK antibody (1:1000; New England Biolabs Inc.). Blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium using goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. REF-52 cells were either microinjected using an Eppendorf Transjector 5246 system or transfected using Superfect (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Microinjected cells were serum-starved for 18 h before microinjection with 100 ng of plasmid/μl and examined by fluorescence microscopy 5 h after microinjection using the appropriate filters (Nikon, Inc.). Transfected cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy with the appropriate filter 18 h after transfection. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism by which KSR regulates ERK activation, the subcellular location of KSR was determined. To detect KSR in live cells, GFP was fused to the amino terminus of KSR (GFP-KSR). We had previously observed the ability of ectopic KSR to inhibit ERK activation (14Joneson T. Fulton J.A. Volle D.J. Chaika O.V. Bar-Sagi D. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7743-7748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To confirm that the fusion of GFP did not alter the ability of KSR to regulate ERK activity, GFP-KSR was cotransfected with Raf-CAAX (a constitutively active form of Raf) into 293T cells, and ERK activity was measured in an immune complex kinase assay. Ectopic expression of GFP-KSR inhibited ERK activity in a manner similar to KSR (Fig. 1), suggesting that the fusion of GFP does not affect the ability of KSR to regulate ERK activity. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that, at steady state, GFP-KSR microinjected into REF-52 cells was located in the cytoplasm in the majority of cells (Fig.2 B). pCMV5KSR was microinjected into REF-52 cells, and the cells were fixed and stained with anti-FLAG (M2) primary and anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies. GFP-KSR had the same cytoplasmic distribution as KSR without GFP attached (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2KSR cycles through the nucleus. A, REF-52 cells were microinjected with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged KSR. KSR was detected within fixed cells with anti-FLAG antibody and a fluorescent secondary antibody (left panel). A phase-contrast photomicrograph of the injected cell (left) and an uninjected cell (right) are shown in the right panel. B, REF-52 cells were microinjected with a plasmid encoding GFP-KSR. Confocal microscopy was performed to determine KSR localization (left panel). REF-52 cells expressing GFP-KSR were treated with 10 nm leptomycin B (LMB) for 2 h, and confocal microscopy was performed to determine KSR localization (right panel). C, the cells described for B were scored, and the percentage of cells with nuclear fluorescence is shown. The number of cells scored under each condition is shown above each bar. Data are presented as the means ± S.D. of four independent experiments for untreated cells and five independent experiments for cells treated with leptomycin B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A small number of REF-52 cells expressing GFP-KSR had nuclear fluorescence. This observation led us to determine whether wild-type KSR undergoes nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. To test this possibility, we treated REF-52 cells expressing GFP-KSR with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of Crm1-mediated nuclear export (35Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon treatment with 10 nm leptomycin B for 2 h, ∼40% of the cells had nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 2, B and C); and importantly, few of the cells contained GFP-KSR exclusively in the cytoplasm. The localization of GFP alone did not change upon treatment with leptomycin B in control experiments (data not shown). This observation demonstrates that KSR cycles continuously in and out of the nucleus. KSR is phosphorylated on multiple phosphorylation sites (16Cacace A.M. Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Mathes K. Copeland T. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Volle D.J. Fulton J.A. Chaika O.V. McDermott K. Huang H. Steinke L.A. Lewis R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5130-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of KSR regulates its subcellular localization, nine of the phosphorylation sites were mutated to non-phosphorylatable residues, and this mutant (GFP-KSR.9mut) was microinjected into REF-52 cells. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that KSR was located in the nucleus (data not shown). To ascertain which phosphorylation sites are important for nucleocytoplasmic transport, GFP fusion constructs of KSR mutants lacking six (6mut), five (5mut), and four (4mut) of the previously identified phosphorylation sites were created and expressed in REF-52 cells. The cells were then scored for nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 3 B). Intact KSR was localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 A). However, 75–80% of the cells expressing 6mut, 5mut, or 4mut showed nuclear localization (Fig. 3 B). To determine which of the phosphorylation sites in GFP-KSR.4mut (T274V/S392A/T411V/S518A) are most important for nuclear localization, all possible single and double phosphorylation mutants were created and expressed in REF-52 cells. The most dramatic shift was seen in cells expressing T274V/S392A, with 80% of the cells showing nuclear fluorescence (Fig. 3, A and B). The individual mutations T274V and S392A had a modest ability to cause nuclear localization of KSR (Fig. 3 B). However, a dramatic redistribution of KSR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was seen upon combining these two mutations. To determine whether Thr274 and Ser392 are the sole determinants of nuclear translocation, Thr274 and Ser392 were reintroduced both individually and in combination to the backbone of KSR.9mut and expressed in REF-52 cells. Reintroduction of the phosphorylation sites individually (KSR.9mutV274T and KSR.9mutA392S) or together (KSR.9mutV274T/A392S) reduced the nuclear localization of KSR by 20–40%, but did not completely prevent its nuclear transport (Fig. 3 C). These data suggest that Thr274 and Ser392 are potent regulators of KSR subcellular localization, but they are not the sole determinants of KSR nucleocytoplasmic transport. The KSR kinase domain binds MEK (10Denouel-Galy A. Douville E.M. Warne P.H. Papin C. Laugier D. Calothy G. Downward J. Eychène A. Curr.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5529-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). KSR.R589M is a predicted kinase-dead mutation (7Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and KSR.C809Y is analogous to a loss-of-function mutation of KSR identified in C. elegans (5Sundaram M. Han M. Cell. 1995; 83: 889-901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To determine whether these mutations in KSR affect nucleocytoplasmic transport, REF-52 cells expressing GFP-KSR.R589M and GFP-KSR.C809Y were treated with 10 nmleptomycin B for 2 h. In quiescent REF-52 cells, GFP-KSR.R589M and GFP-KSR.C809Y were located in the cytoplasm (Fig.4 A, panels 1,3, and 5). In contrast to wild-type KSR, treatment with leptomycin B failed to significantly increase the nuclear accumulation of GFP-KSR.C809Y; however, there was a slight increase in nuclear accumulation in cells expressing GFP-KSR.R589M (Fig. 4, A, panels 2, 4, and6; and B). These data indicate that mutations R589M and C809Y inhibit the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of KSR. To determine whether there is a correlation between regulation of ERK activity by KSR and the ability of KSR to shuttle through the nucleus, we assessed the ability of KSR.R589M and KSR.C809Y to regulate ERK activation. KSR, KSR.R589M, and KSR.C809Y were cotransfected with Raf-CAAX into 293T cells, and ERK activity was measured. Wild-type KSR inhibited 90% of ERK activation by Raf-CAAX; ectopic expression of KSR.R589M inhibited only 50% of ERK activation; and KSR.C809Y had no effect on ERK activation (Fig. 4 C). We further assessed the dependence of nuclear translocation of KSR on its interaction with MEK by creating a KSR construct containing the R589M, T274V, and S392A mutations. We observed that R589M was dominant with respect to the nuclear localizing effects of the phosphorylation site mutations (Fig. 5). These data suggest a relationship between the subcellular distribution of KSR, its ability to interact with MEK, and its ability to regulate ERK activity. The sequence PKKKRKV from the SV40 large T antigen (34Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar) was spliced by PCR to the carboxyl-terminal end of CFP-KSR (CFP-KSR.NLS), CFP-KSR.R589M (CFP-KSR.R589MNLS), and CFP-KSR.C809Y (CFP-KSR.C809YNLS) (Fig.6 A). These constructs were then expressed in REF-52 cells, and their subcellular localization was detected by fluorescence microscopy. All three NLS constructs were located exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 6 B). To determine whether the nuclear localization of KSR alters its ability to inhibit ERK activation, we performed ERK kinase assays on lysates from cells transfected with activated Raf-CAAX alone or with KSR constructs targeted to the nucleus. Mutation of phosphorylation sites on KSR that redistribute KSR to the nucleus or the addition of an NLS to wild-type KSR had little if any effect on its ability to inhibit ERK activation (Fig. 7). It has been reported that MEK accumulates in the nucleus upon treatment with leptomycin B (31Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that MEK undergoes nucleocytoplasmic transport. Because KSR also undergoes nucleocytoplasmic transport and KSR and MEK interact, we sought to determine whether MEK plays a role in the nucleocytoplasmic transport of KSR. We analyzed the effect of MEK1 coexpression on the subcellular localization of KSR constructs targeted to specific subcellular compartments. To perform this analysis, YFP was fused to the amino terminus of MEK1, and CFP was added to the amino terminus of each KSR construct. This strategy enabled us to determine the subcellular location of MEK1 and KSR proteins simultaneously. When expressed together, YFP-MEK1 and CFP-KSR were located in the cytoplasm (data not shown). KSR.NLS constructs were coexpressed with YFP-MEK1 to evaluate the effect of MEK1 on KSR subcellular distribution. YFP-MEK1 remained in the cytoplasm when coexpressed with all KSR.NLS constructs and the KSR phosphorylation mutant CFP-KSR.T274V/S392A (Fig.8, A and C). However, in the same cells, expression of YFP-MEK1 caused a marked redistribution of CFP-KSR.T274V/S392A from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 8 C). Furthermore, coexpression of YFP-MEK1 with CFP-KSR.NLS caused a redistribution of CFP-KSR.NLS from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. When coexpressed with YFP-MEK1, CFP-KSR.NLS was nuclear in only 25% of the cells compared with 98% of the cells when CFP-KSR.NLS was expressed alone (Fig. 8 D). These data suggest that MEK could enhance nuclear export and/or inhibit nuclear import of KSR. However, additional data suggest that it is unlikely that interaction with MEK inhibits KS"

However, molecular mechanisms of the redundancy between glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid actions remain unknown because of complicated cross-talk among, for example, these adrenal steroids, their cognate receptors, and target genes. Receptor-specific ligand that can distinctly modulate target gene expression should be developed to overcome this issue. In this report, we showed that a pyrazolosteroid cortivazol (CVZ) does not induce either nuclear translocation or transactivation function of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) but does both for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Moreover, deletion analysis of the C-terminal end of the GR has revealed that CVZ interacts with the distinct portion of the ligand binding domain (LBD) and differentially modulates the ligand-dependent interaction between transcription intermediary factor 2 and the LBD when compared with cortisol, dexamethasone, and aldosterone. Thus, it is indicated that CVZ may not be only a molecular probe for the analysis of the redundancy between the GR and MR in vivo but also a useful reagent to clarify structure-function relationship of the GR LBD.

Ligand-receptor coupling is one of the important constituents of signal transduction and is essential for physiological transmission of actions of endogenous substances including hormones, cytokines, and chemokines. Of note, redundancy occurs at the level of both multiple ligands for each receptor and multiple receptors for each ligand, leading to the generation of multiple pathways to achieve similar or different cellular responses. Underlying mechanisms of redundancy, therefore, are distinct among each ligand-receptor coupling and are often tissue-specific. In any case, such redundancy is considered to play an important role in precise tuning of biological actions of ligand and receptor. From a pharmacological point of view, selective modulators with small molecular weight controlling redundancy may be of clinical versatility (1Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T.

Glucocorticoids are produced in the adrenal cortex under the strict control of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and exert a variety of biological actions as follows: regulation of glucose metabolism, lipolysis, immune system, cardiovascular system, electrolyte metabolism, and central nervous system (4Sapolsky R.M. Romero L.M. Munck A.U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5611) Google Scholar). Moreover, at pharmacological doses, various glucocorticoid compounds are widely used as an anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive reagent (5Cato A.C. Wade E. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid actions are believed to be mediated by the binding to their cognate receptor, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), 1The abbreviations used are:GRglucocorticoid receptorAF-1activation function-1ALDaldosteroneARandrogen receptor11β-HSD11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseCVZcortivazolDBDDNA binding domainDCCdextran-coated charcoalDEXdexamethasoneFcortisolFCSfetal calf serumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinGREglucocorticoid response elementhsp90heat shock protein 90LBDligand binding domainMRmineralocorticoid receptorMREmineralocorticoid response elementNIDnuclear receptor interaction domainPMAphorbol 12-myristate acetateTIF2transcription intermediary factor 2PBSphosphate-buffered salineDTTdithiothreitolCHOChinese hamster ovaryMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCcytoplasmicNnuclear which belongs to the steroid, thyroid, and retinoic acid receptor superfamily (6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The GR has a modular structure comprising several regions (6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region harbors an autonomous activation function, denoted activation function-1 (AF-1). The central DNA binding domain (DBD) is highly conserved and is composed of two zinc fingers involved in DNA binding and receptor dimerization (6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Nuclear targeting of receptors is directed by two nuclear localization signals, NL1, and NL2, that are mapped immediately C-terminal to the DBD and in the ligand binding domain (LBD), respectively (6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The LBDs of the nuclear receptors have a common fold, with 12 α-helices (numbered H1 through H12) and one β-turn arranged as an antiparallel α-helical “sandwich” in a three-layer structure and mediates numerous functions, including ligand binding, nuclear targeting, interaction with heat shock protein 90 (hsp90), dimerization, interaction with coactivators, and hormone-dependent transactivation (7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 8Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin.

Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Many coactivators for the GR and MR have been identified to date, including steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1), transcriptional intermediary factor 2 (TIF2/GRIP-1), and CBP/p300 (7Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ligand, the GR is a part of a large protein complex, in which they interact with the hsp90, and ligand binding promotes conformational change and hsp90 release (11Simons S.S., Jr. Pratt W.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 406-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The receptors then translocate into the nucleus and act as a transcription factor, binding as a homodimer to the glucocorticoid response elements (GRE), and regulate transcription with the aid of those coactivators and mediators (6Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, part of the glucocorticoid actions are not mediated by binding to DNA but by the interaction with other protein factors. For example, the GR represses activity of the transcription factor AP-1 and NF-κB, which is now considered to be a pharmacological basis of anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids (often referred as transrepression) (12Adcock I.M. Caramori G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Moreover, the concept of ligand-based modularity of the structure and function of the GR is now experimentally challenged, and so-called dissociated glucocorticoids or selective GR modifiers are being developed to separate untoward actions from therapeutic activities of glucocorticoids (12Adcock I.M. Caramori G. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 376-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 13Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche-Rigon M.

Romero L.M. Munck A.U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 55-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5611) Google Scholar). Because glucocorticoids, under certain physiological and pharmacological conditions, can also cause mineralocorticoid-like sodium and fluid retention, the functional redundancy has been suggested between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (15Fuller P.J. Lim-Tio S.S. Brennan F.E. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is highly homologous with the GR (16Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar), and these receptors are simultaneously expressed in several tissues (15Fuller P.J. Lim-Tio S.S. Brennan F.E.

Moreover, biochemical experiments have revealed that the GR binds not only glucocorticoids but also mineralocorticoid, and the MR binds not only mineralocorticoids but also glucocorticoids with high affinity (18Teutsch G.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although more complicated, the GR and MR can bind common DNA sequences of the GRE on the promoter region of some but not all of the target genes (26Govindan M.V. Leclerc S. Roy R. Rathanaswami P. Xie B.X. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Kolla V. Robertson N.M. Litwack G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The enzyme type 2 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD2) contributes to some extent in the functional distinction of these different classes of steroid hormones, because this enzyme inactivates endogenous glucocorticoids into 11-keto congeners (28Funder J.W. Pearce P.T. Smith R. Smith A.I. Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar). However, particularly in the brain and heart in which the GR and MR are simultaneously expressed but 11β-HSD2 is not (29Young M. Funder J.W. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 224-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the biological significance of the redundancy between glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid remains unknown (29Young M.

Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 1250-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Several receptor-specific ligands that can distinctly regulate target gene expression have been developed and contribute to understanding this redundancy (19Gomez-Sanchez C.E. Gomez-Sanchez E.P. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Lomax R.B. Sandle G.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G485-G493PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kim P.J. Cole M.A. Kalman B.A. Spencer R.L. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 67: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The phenylpyrazolo glucocorticoid cortivazol (CVZ) is a synthetic glucocorticoid agonist, which has been reported to have two dissociation constants for the GR and be 40-fold more potent than the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase in HTC cells (34Schlechte J.A. Schmidt T.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1987; 64: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Schlechte J.A. Simons S.S., Jr. Lewis D.A. Thompson E.B. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CVZ has been shown more effective in raising blood pressure than other natural and several synthetic glucocorticoids in sheep. However, in contrast to F, DEX, and ALD, CVZ did not decrease plasma potassium concentration (36Spence C.D. Coghlan J.P. Denton D.A. Mills E.H. Whitworth J.A. Scoggins B.A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1986; 25: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to speculate that CVZ might regulate electrolyte and fluid balance not via the MR but exclusively by the GR. In this line, we studied the mechanism of CVZ action on the GR and MR. As anticipated, CVZ did not induce either nuclear translocation or transactivation function of the MR but did both of the GR. Moreover, mutational analysis of the C-terminal end of the GR revealed that CVZ interacts with the distinct portions of the LBD and differentially modulates the ligand-dependent interaction between TIF2 and the LBD when compared with F, DEX, and ALD. We thus indicate that CVZ may be not only a molecular probe for the analysis of the redundancy between the GR and MR in vivo but also a useful reagent to clarify structure-function relationships of the GR LBD. F, DEX, ALD, and phorbol 12-myristate acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma. CVZ was a gift from Merck. Other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise specified. Monoclonal anti-hsp90 antibodies (IgG and IgM) were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Goat anti-mouse IgM and control mouse IgM, TEPC183, were obtained from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was obtained fromCLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). Polyclonal anti-GRIP1/TIF2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). COS7, CV-1, CHO, F9, and HeLa cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Iwaki Glass Inc., Chiba, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. In all experiments, serum steroids were stripped with dextran-coated charcoal (DCC), and cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Heat shock treatment for COS7 cells was achieved by shifting flasks to another 5% CO2 incubator set at 43 °C. The expression plasmids for the wild-type human GR, pRShGRα, and wild-type human MR, pRShMR, were the kind gifts from Dr. R. M. Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Another expression plasmid for the wild-type human GR, pCMX-GR, was constructed by cutting out a KpnI-XhoI fragment including the entire human GR-coding sequence and the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions from pRShGRα, and this fragment was inserted into parent pCMX (37Perlmann T.

The expression plasmids for chimeric protein of GAL4-DBD and the LBD of the human GR (Glu-489 to Lys-777), pCMX-GAL-L-hGR (pCMX-GAL4-GRLBD), was a kind gift from Dr. K. Umesono (University of Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan). To construct an expression plasmid for chimeric protein of VP16 transactivation domain and nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID) of the TIF2, the DNA fragment encoding 173 amino acids (Glu-594 to Leu-766) of the human TIF2 were amplified by PCR using pSG5-TIF2 (the kind gift from Dr. P. Chambon, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Strasbourg, France) as a template with appropriate flanking sequences and inserted into the parent pCMX-VP16 (37Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), resulting in pCMX-VP-TIF2NID. To construct the expression plasmids for the C-terminal truncated mutant of the GR, pCMX-GR-(1–774), pCMX-GR-(1–765), pCMX-GR-(1–750), pCMX-GFP-GR-(1–774), pCMX-GFP-GR-(1–765), and pCMX-GFP-GR-(1–750), the DNA fragments encoding corresponding amino acids (Leu-596 to Phe-774, Ser-765, or Pro-750) of the human GR were amplified by PCR with appropriate flanking sequences and inserted intoPstI-BamHI-opened parent pCMX-GR or pCMX-GFP-GR. Construction of pCMX-GRI747T, pCMX-GRL753F, pCMX-GFP-GRI747T, pCMX-GFP-GRL753F, and pCMX-GAL4-GRLBDL753F was carried out involving point mutations to generate substitution of Ile-747 by Thr or Leu-753 by Phe in the human GR with QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pCMX-GR, pCMX-GFP-GR, and pCMX-GAL4-GRLBD as templates. Expression plasmid for the GFP-tagged DNA-binding deficient mutant of the GR, pCMX-GFP-D4X, was constructed by cutting out a ClaI-BamHI fragment from the plasmid phGR-D4X (the kind gift from Dr. A. C. B. Cato, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany) (40Heck S. Kullmann M. Gast A. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4087-4095Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and this fragment was inserted into ClaI-BamHI-opened parent pCMX-GFP-GR. The glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid pGRE/MRE-Luc, GAL4-responsive reporter plasmid tk-GALpx3-LUC (41Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I.

Tang J. Kawakami Y. Ito M. Aizawa S. Tanaka H. Makino I. Handa H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 810-819PubMed Google Scholar) were described previously. The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency when appropriate. COS7 cells transfected with pRShGRα or pRShMR were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-treated FCS in 12-well flat-bottom plastic plates (IWAKI Glass) to confluence. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and medium was replaced with Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and then cultured with 20 nm [3H]DEX (70–110 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in GR-expressing cells or [3H]ALD (50–85 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in the MR-expressing cells in the presence or absence of various concentrations of radioinert ligands for 4 h at 37 °C. The monolayer was washed three times with PBS and lysed in the whole cell extract buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P40, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Aliquots were added to scintillation fluid to determine radioactivity. The difference between total and nonspecific binding gives specific GR- or MR-binding sites. Results are expressed as percent of maximum binding, which is given relative to the maximal [3H]DEX or [3H]ALD binding in the absence of competitors. Nonspecific binding was determined by the experiments run in parallel without any receptor-expressing vector. Cells were plated on 6-cm diameter culture dishes (IWAKI Glass) to 30–50% confluence, and cell culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM medium lacking phenol red before transfection. Plasmid mixture was mixed with TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) and added to the culture. Total amount of the plasmids was kept constant by adding an irrelevant plasmid (pGEM3Z was used unless otherwise specified). After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-treated FCS, and the cells were further cultured in the presence or absence of various reagents for 24 h at 37 °C. After normalization of transfection efficiency by β-galactosidase expression, luciferase enzyme activity was determined using a luminometer (Berthold GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany) essentially as described before (43Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For analysis of subcellular localization of the GR and MR in living cells, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged receptors in COS7 cells, and assays were performed as described previously (38Okamoto K. Tanaka H. Ogawa H. Makino Y. Eguchi H. Hayashi S. Yoshikawa N. Poellinger L. Umesono K. Makino I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10363-10371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 6 h of transient transfection of the expression plasmids for GFP fusion proteins, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-treated FCS, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h, then at 30 °C for at least 4 h, and at 37 °C thereafter. After various treatments, cells were examined using an IX70 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) enclosed by an incubator and equipped with a heating stage and an fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set, and photographs were taken for 8 randomly selected views. Quantitative assessment of the subcellular localization of expressed GFP fusion proteins was performed according to methods described previously (38Okamoto K. Tanaka H. Ogawa H. Makino Y. Eguchi H.

In brief, blindfolded observers were asked to examine the photographs for each experimental set and classify ∼200 GFP-positive cells into four different categories: N < C for cytoplasmic dominant fluorescence; N = C, cells having equal distribution of fluorescence in the cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) compartments; N > C for nuclear-dominant fluorescence; N for exclusive nuclear fluorescence. For analysis of the interaction between GFP-tagged receptors and hsp90, we transiently expressed GFP chimeric protein in COS7 cells, and the assays were performed as described previously (38Okamoto K. Tanaka H. Ogawa H. Makino Y. Eguchi H. Hayashi S. Yoshikawa N. Poellinger L. Umesono K. Makino I. J. Biol.

Briefly, whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells, and immunoprecipitation experiments, with either the anti-hsp90 IgM antibody 3G3 or control mouse IgM antibody TEPC 183, were carried out as follows. Goat anti-mouse IgM was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) by incubating in the coupling buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) overnight at 4 °C. 35 μg of either the monoclonal anti-hsp90 IgM antibody or control mouse IgM antibody were then incubated with 80 μl of a 1:1 suspension of the goat anti-mouse IgM antibody coupled to Sepharose in MENG buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10% glycerol) on ice for 90 min. This Sepharose-adsorbed material was pelleted and washed successively and then resuspended in 80 μl of MENG buffer containing 20 mmsodium molybdate, 2 mm DTT, 0.25 m NaCl, and 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. In immunoprecipitation experiments, 70 μg of cellular protein was added to the suspension. The reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 90 min, after which Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with MENG buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 2 mm DTT. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrically transferred to an Immobilon-NC Pure nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Subsequently, immunoblotting was performed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody diluted at 1:500, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Biosciences) diluted at 1:1000. After stripping off the immune complexes, Western immunoblot analysis was performed on the same membrane for detection of hsp90 and GFP chimeric protein, using monoclonal mouse anti-hsp90 IgG antibody 3B6 (1:500) and a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:500), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig diluted at 1:1000. In parallel, 20 μg of whole cell extracts were independently used for immunodetection of GFP chimeric protein and hsp90. Antibody-protein complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). GFP-tagged chimeric GR and TIF2-expressing COS7 cells were grown on 8-chambered sterile glass slides (Nippon Becton Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) and further cultured for 2 h in the presence or absence of various steroid ligands. For immunostaining of TIF2, the cells were fixed in cold acetone for 2 min on ice and air-dried. After fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS at room temperature and incubated with anti-mouse GRIP1/TIF2 polyclonal goat antibody at a dilution of 1:50 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were finally washed three times with PBS and mounted with GEL/MOUNT™ (Biomeda Corp.) for examination on a confocal laser scanning microscope IX70. Dual excitation was achieved from krypton-argon laser, and digital images were analyzed on FLUOVIEW FV 500 systems (Olympus). As described in the Introduction, both the GR and MR, at least in part, bind to the common palindromic DNA sequence and transactivate gene expression. To test the effect of natural and synthetic glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoid on transactivation function of the receptors, we first performed transient transfection assay using GRE/MRE-luciferase as a reporter in COS7 cells. In the absence of expression plasmids for the receptors, any of F, DEX, ALD, and CVZ did not induce significant luciferase activity (Fig. 1 A). When the human GR expression plasmid was cotransfected, not only F, DEX, and CVZ but ALD as well induced expression of the reporter plasmid (Fig.1 A). When"

The main chains of the three (βα)8−barrel proteins superimpose closely, and the packing of side chains in the β-barrel cores, as well as the architecture of surface loops, is very similar. Both thermostable proteins have, however, 17 strong salt bridges, compared with only 10 in eIGPS. The number of additional salt bridges in tIGPS and sIGPS correlates well with their reduced rate of irreversible thermal inactivation at 90 °C. Only 3 of 17 salt bridges in tIGPS and sIGPS are topologically conserved. The major difference between the two proteins is the preference for interhelical salt bridges in sIGPS and intrahelical ones in tIGPS. The different implementation of salt bridges in the closely related proteins suggests that the stabilizing effect of salt bridges depends rather on the sum of their individual contributions than on their location. This observation is consistent with a protein unfolding mechanism where the simultaneous breakdown of all salt bridges is the rate-determining step.

The picture of salt bridges generally strengthening thermostable proteins has, however, been modified by recent work. Computational studies (7Xiao L. Honig B. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1843-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), have shown that the decisive feature is rather the optimal placement of charged residues on the protein surface. We are interested in how the (βα)8−barrel fold (12Nagano N. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2072-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which is frequently observed in enzymes with quite different functions (13Copley R.R. Bork P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 627-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), is stabilized in thermophilic organisms. We have previously studied the (βα)8-barrel enzymes phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase (PRAI)1 and indoleglycerol-phosphate synthase (IGPS), which catalyze two consecutive steps in the pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis. InEscherichia coli (14Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 477-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), IGPS and PRAI are the covalently linked domains of the bifunctional enzyme eIGPS-ePRAI. The genetically separated ePRAI and eIGPS domains are fully active monomers (15Eberhard M. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Bolewska K. Hommel U. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5419-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but their covalent linkage in the parental protein is advantageous, because it stabilizes the particularly labile eIGPS domain. Previous comparisons of ePRAI with the thermostable PRAI fromThermotoga maritima (tPRAI) (16Sterner R. Kleemann G.R. Szadkowski H. Lustig A. Hennig M. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2000-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have shown that significant stabilization can be achieved by dimerization (17Thoma R. Hennig M. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Structure. 2000; 8: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), most likely assisted by the larger number of salt bridges in tPRAI (18Hennig M. Sterner R. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6009-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In contrast to tPRAI, the thermostable IGPS from Sulfolobus solfataricus (sIGPS) is monomeric, and structural comparisons (19Hennig M. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar,20Knöchel T.R. Hennig M. Merz A. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) suggested that sIGPS is stabilized mainly by having almost twice as many salt bridges as eIGPS. In the same vein, the α-subunit of tryptophan synthase from Pyrococcus furiosus, another monomeric, thermostable (βα)8-barrel protein involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, possesses almost three times as many ion pairs as its orthologue from E. coli (21Yamagata Y. Ogasahra O. Hioki Y. Lee S.J. Nakagawa A. Nakamura H. Ishida M. Kuramitsu S. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11062-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To gain more general insight and to address the question as to whether closely related (βα)8-barrel proteins use the same mechanism of thermostabilization, we sought another monomeric, thermostable IGPS for structural comparison with sIGPS and eIGPS. We report here the crystallization and crystal structure analysis of IGPS from the thermophilic bacterium T. maritima (tIGPS). tIGPS is monomeric in solution and extremely thermostable. It is inactivated irreversibly with a similar half-life as sIGPS (11versus 15 min, respectively, at 90 °C) (22Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and it displays the same large number of strong salt bridges. In both proteins the majority of salt bridges is distributed over the protein surface. Interestingly, however, only a few of them are topologically conserved. The main difference is their location on the exposed α-helices; tIGPS prefers intrahelical salt bridges but sIGPS prefers interhelical ones. The general conclusion is that stabilization of the (βα)8-barrel fold can be achieved by both short and long range surface salt bridges and that the location of a salt bridge is less important than its strength as determined by the local geometry and hydrogen bond pattern. The large difference in the rate of irreversible denaturation observed between the thermolabile and thermostable IGP synthases could be because of the additive effect of the simultaneous disruption of all salt bridges in the rate-determining step of unfolding. IGPS fromT. maritima was purified as described (22Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purified protein was concentrated to 13 mg/ml in a solution containing 2 mm EDTA and 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) buffered with 10 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5. The best crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C by mixing 2 or 4 μl of protein solution with 2 μl of a reservoir solution containing 8–11% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and 160–180 mm ammonium sulfate, buffered with 100 mmsodium cacodylate at pH 6.0. These conditions are similar to those used for growing crystals of form B of sIGPS (20Knöchel T.R. Hennig M. Merz A. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A complete diffraction data set at 2.5 Å resolution was collected at λ = 0.8722 Å and 4 °C on a MAR research image plate at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, using a single crystal with the approximate dimensions of 0.6 × 0.4 × 0.3 mm3. Data were evaluated with the MOSFLM program package (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Integrated intensities were scaled with program SCALA (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) and merged using AGROVATA (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol.

The reflection intensities were finally converted to structure factor amplitudes with TRUNCATE (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). According to symmetry and systematic absences observed in simulated precession photographs, the space group was determined to be either P41 or P43. The latter was subsequently confirmed by the molecular replacement solution.

Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). A model based on the coordinates of sIGPS (35% sequence identity; Protein Data Bank entry 1JUL) was used for the molecular replacement computations. The N-terminal residues 2–30 and the C-terminal residues 246–248 were deleted from the search model, because of the lack of sequence identity within these regions. In addition, all non-identical residues except glycine were trimmed to alanine. Cross-rotation searches were calculated in several resolution ranges using an integration sphere of 12 Å and a sampling step of 1° in the resolution range 10.0–3.0 Å. Translation function computations were carried out for the 50 highest peaks of the cross-rotation search. A first clear solution with low R-factor and high correlation coefficient could be identified when space group P43 was assumed. This was not the case for space group P41. The relative position of a second NCS-related molecule was found, when the structure factors calculated from the first solution were vectorially added to those generated from the search model in a subsequent translation function calculation. 10 cycles of rigid body refinement with AMoRe, using the data within the resolution range 11.0 to 4.0 Å with both solutions combined, reduced the R-factor to 45.6%, significantly lower than for all other solutions in the peak list. The correctness of this molecular replacement solution was further confirmed by favorable crystal packing. Unless stated otherwise, all crystallographic refinement calculations were carried out with the program package X-PLOR (version 3.1f) (25Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). Interactive model building was performed with the graphic programs “O” (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) or FRODO (27Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The initial model was subjected to a rigid body refinement, treating the two molecules in the asymmetric unit as individual rigid entities. The resolution range was increased stepwise from 11.0–4.0 to 11.0–3.0 Å. This gave rise to an R-factor of 46.7% (free R-factor for 5% of the data, 49.8%). Combined solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold NCS averaging as implemented in DM (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) were used to improve the model phases. A solvent mask was calculated with the program NCSMASK (23Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallog. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) based on the molecular replacement model but additionally including the N-terminal residues 2–30 of sIGPS (Protein Data Bank entry 1JUL) as poly(Ala) model. Three cycles of phase extension and phase recombination in the “reflection omit” mode improved the electron density map significantly. A simulated annealing protocol was applied using all data in the resolution range of 30–2.5 Å with strict NCS constraints. The initial temperature of 2500 K was decreased to 300 K in steps of 25 K, each covering a time interval of 25 fs. This led to an R-factor of 34.0% (free R-factor 40.5%) after 50 additional cycles of positional refinement. In this and in all subsequent calculations, partial structure factors were vectorially added to correct for the scattering contribution of the bulk solvent. Several rounds of positional and B-factor refinement were performed. The NCS constraints were released, and both molecules were refined independently. Electron density maps employing 2F o − F c andF o − F c coefficients were calculated, and the model was improved by interactive graphical model building. Water molecules were added and refined. Water molecules with temperature factors above 65 Å2 were discarded. Tetrahedrally shaped electron density peaks, observed at the phosphate-binding sites of both molecules, were modeled as sulfate ions. Because phosphate was also present during crystallization (the protein sample used for crystallization was stored in a solution containing 10 mm potassium phosphate), partial occupation of these sites by phosphate ions cannot be excluded. The final model has an R-factor of 16.9% for all data in the resolution range 30.0–2.5 Å (free R-factor for 5% of data 23.3%). More details of the refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. In both molecules, 92% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram (28Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar), whereas 7.6% are in additionally allowed areas. An exception is Ser210, which in both molecules is found in a disallowed region (molecule A: φ = 69.9°, ψ = 159.3°; molecule B: φ = 76.0°, ψ = 149.9°). The corresponding residues in sIGPS (Ser211) and eIGPS (Ser215) have similar disallowed φ,ψ angles (14Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 477-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Hennig M. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N.

Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). In this work, the term ion pair denotes an interaction (not necessarily hydrogen-bonded) between a pair of oppositely charged residues with N–O distances below a certain threshold, regardless of their relative orientation. Barlow and Thornton (29Barlow D.J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 867-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) proposed a distance threshold for ion pairs of 4.0 Å. Salt bridges as described in this study are hydrogen-bonded ion pairs with a distance between donor (D) and acceptor (A) ≤3.7 Å, angle Cadj–D···A >90°, and angle Cadj–A···D >90°, where Cadj are the carbon atoms covalently bound to the respective donor or acceptor atoms (30Baker E.N. Hubbard R.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1984; 44: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 31McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). tIGPS was crystallized with polyethylene glycol 8000 as precipitant, in buffer conditions that were similar to those resulting in crystal form B of sIGPS (20Knöchel T.R. Hennig M. Merz A. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The crystals of tIGPS belong to space group P43 with cell dimensions a =b = 48.9 Å, c = 248.0 Å and α = β = γ = 90°. The asymmetric unit contains two tIGPS molecules, corresponding to a solvent content of 53% (V m = 2.59 Å3/Da) (32Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). Each of the molecules (designated A and B in Fig.1 a) contains a sulfate ion bound to the subsite presumably occupied by the phosphomonoester moiety of the substrate during catalysis. Unexpectedly, the molecules A and B are covalently linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond involving the unique residue Cys102 in loop 2In this study, loops are labeled according to the secondary structural elements connected by them.α2β3, although the protein stock solutions used for crystallization contained both DTT and EDTA. The mutual orientation of the molecules A and B of the dimer corresponds to an ∼180° rotation around a vertical axis to the plane (Fig.1 a). An enlarged view of the interface region is shown in Fig. 1 b. The disulfide bond is well defined in the electron density map, and no further significant interactions are observed between the molecules A and B. Because the connected cysteine side chains of the covalent dimer are solvent-accessible (the accessible surface areas of Cys102are 66 Å2 and 53 Å2 in molecules A and B, respectively), the intermolecular disulfide bond is readily reduced by DTT (22Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This bond might have been formed by autoxidation either before crystallization or facilitated by the proper orientation of the cysteine side chains in the crystal lattice (33Heinz D.W. Matthews B.W. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whatever the case may be, the spontaneous autoxidation was not controlled by the experimental conditions, which may explain the difficulties encountered in growing crystals of high quality. The superposition of the three main chains (Fig. 1 c) illustrates that tIGPS shares the (βα)8-barrel fold with both eIGPS (14Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), including the N-terminal extension of 44 residues and the extra helix α8′ that is located in the loop between strand β8 and helix α8. A unique structural feature of tIGPS is helix α7, which is completely in the 310-helical conformation, in contrast to α7of eIGPS and sIGPS, where regular α-helices are formed. 96% of Cα atoms of tIGPS and eIGPS are superimposable within a distance cut-off of 3.8 Å (r.m.s.d. 1.42 Å). Applying the same criteria, only 88% of Cα atoms of tIGPS and sIGPS can be superimposed (r.m.s.d. 1.19 Å). Thus, as judged by the number of superimposable Cα atoms, the structural scaffold of tIGPS is more similar to that of the thermolabile eIGPS than to that of the thermostable sIGPS. The structural differences between the three backbones, however, are mainly restricted to the N-terminal extension, which contains the extra helix α0 that forms one wall of the active site. Helix α0 is longer in tIGPS than in sIGPS, but shorter than its equivalent in eIGPS. As in sIGPS (19Hennig M. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), tIGPS contains an extra helix α00 at the N terminus of the β-barrel. The backbone of eIGPS superimposes well on the traces of helix α00 of the thermostable IGP synthases, although it was not so assigned in earlier studies (14Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 477-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 19Hennig M. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the sequences of tIGPS, sIGPS, and eIGPS aligned according to the superposition of their backbone structures (Fig. 1 c). The alignment of most residues is unambiguous and confirms earlier alignments (35Sterner R. Dahm A. Darimont B. Ivens A. Liebl W. Kirschner K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4395-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that were based on the sequences alone. The β-strands and α-helices of the canonical (βα)8-barrel align almost perfectly, and there are only minor deletions in the loops β1α1 and α8′α8of sIGPS. Differences arise in regions where the three structures do not superimpose well, namely the segment between helix α0and strand β1. Conformational flexibility, experimental errors, and crystal packing effects are expressed in temperature factors and in the distance of equivalent atoms in superimposed molecules that are related by non-crystallographic symmetry. Fig. 3depicts the deviations between equivalent Cα positions of the molecules A and B of tIGPS in the asymmetric unit, after superposition with program “O” (26Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The r.m.s.d. of Cα positions between molecule A and B is 0.28 Å, which is of the same order of magnitude as described for the sIGPS structures in different crystal forms (20Knöchel T.R. Hennig M. Merz A. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The largest deviations of equivalent residues correlate well with areas of high main chain temperature factors (data not shown). It is worth noting that two of the largest deviations observed with tIGPS, namely in the loops β6α6 (residues 180–190) and α6β7 (residues 196–204), are not observed when comparing the crystal forms A–C of sIGPS (20Knöchel T.R. Hennig M. Merz A. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but coincide with the peaks in the profile of main chain temperature factors of eIGPS (14Wilmanns M. Priestle J.P. Niermann T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 477-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The loop β6α6 carries the invariant residues Arg181 and Leu183 adjacent to catalytic residue Asn179 (cf. Fig. 2), indicating that the flexibility of this loop may be important for the relatively large activity of tIGPS at low temperatures (22Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 753-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Changes in the size and packing of internal hydrophobic clusters can influence the thermostability of proteins (36Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The fraction of carbon atoms that are buried (zero solvent accessibility) gives an approximate measure for the extent of hydrophobic interactions within a protein. 53% of all carbon atoms of tIGPS are buried, whereas, applying the same criteria, 61% are buried in sIGPS as well as in eIGPS (19Hennig M. Darimont B. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, the percentage of buried carbon atoms does not correlate with the relative thermostabilities of tIGPS, sIGPS, and eIGPS. The hydrophobic core in the interior of the three β-barrels is highly conserved. The positions of the side chains located in the four interior layers (37Wilmanns M. Hyde C.C. Davies D.R. Kirschner K. Jansonius J.N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9161-9169Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) are numbered in Fig. 2. Eleven of 16 positions are occupied by identical residues. Five of these identical residues are invariant or highly conserved among 25 sequences. Two of the invariant residues are catalytically essential in eIGPS (Lys114 and Glu163), and one (Glu53) is catalytically important (38Darimont B. Stehlin C. Szadkowski H. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1221-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The remaining five positions are occupied by similar residues (i.e. Gly/Ala, Val/Ile, and Ala/Thr). Thus, there is no dramatic difference in the packing of the β-barrel cores of the three IGP synthases. Cavities in the interior of proteins are assumed to be energetically unfavorable, due to the reduced number of van der Waals contacts as compared with a more densely packed environment (39Hubbard S.J. Gross K.-H. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The number and the size of cavities in tIGPS, sIGPS, and eIGPS were analyzed with the program GRASP (40Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Glucosylceramide (GlcCer), lactosylceramide (LacCer), and globotriaosylceramide (Gb(3)Cer) in vesicles containing phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) dose dependently enhanced factor Va inactivation by the anticoagulant factors, activated protein C (APC) and protein S. Addition of GlcCer to PC/PS vesicles enhanced protein S-dependent APC cleavage in factor Va at Arg-506 by 13-fold, whereas PC/PS vesicles alone minimally affected protein S enhancement of this reaction. Incorporation into PC/PS vesicles of GlcCer, LacCer, or Gb(3)Cer, but not galactosylceramide or globotetraosylceramide, dose dependently prolonged factor Xa-1-stage clotting times of normal plasma in the presence of added APC without affecting baseline clotting times in the absence of APC, showing that certain neutral glycosphingolipids enhance anticoagulant but not procoagulant reactions in plasma. Thus, certain neutral glycosphingolipids (e.g. GlcCer, LacCer, and Gb(3)Cer) can enhance anticoagulant activity of APC/protein S by mechanisms that are distinctly different from those of phospholipids alone. We speculate that under some circumstances certain neutral glycosphingolipids either in lipoprotein particles or in cell membranes may help form antithrombotic microdomains that might enhance down-regulation of thrombin by APC in vivo."

Studies on DNA replication and related processes have provided detailed insights in the function of many proteins involved in these processes (for review, see Ref. 1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Fransisco1992Google Scholar). Despite this, little is known about the in vivo organization of DNA replication. To gain a better insight in this fundamental process, we studied the in vivo DNA replication of the Bacillus subtilisbacteriophage φ29 (2Meijer W.J.J. Lewis P.J. Errington J. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4182-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The detailed knowledge of its in vitro mechanism of DNA replication (for reviews, see Refs. 3Salas M. Rojo F. Sonenshein A.L.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar) made φ29 an attractive system for this study. The genome of φ29 is a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 1dsDNAdouble-stranded DNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNATPterminal proteinSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding protein 1dsDNAdouble-stranded DNAssDNAsingle-stranded DNATPterminal proteinSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding protein of 19,285 base pairs that contains a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked at each 5′ end. Fig. 1 A shows a schematic representation of the genetic and transcriptional organization of the φ29 genome. Regulation of φ29 DNA transcription, which can be divided into an early and a late stage, has been studied extensivelyin vivo as well as in vitro (for reviews, see Refs. 3Salas M. Rojo F.

The late expressed genes, all transcribed from a single operon present in the central part of the genome, encode the structural proteins of the phage, proteins involved in morphogenesis, and those required for lysis of the infected cell. The early expressed genes are present in two operons that flank the late operon. The early operon located at the left side of the φ29 genome encodes the transcriptional regulator protein p4 and various proteins that are directly involved in phage DNA replication, such as the DNA polymerase, TP, single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB), double-stranded DNA-binding protein, and protein p1. The operon located at the right side of the φ29 genome encodes, in addition to proteins p17 and p16.7, four putative proteins of unknown function. double-stranded DNA single-stranded DNA terminal protein single-stranded DNA-binding protein double-stranded DNA single-stranded DNA terminal protein single-stranded DNA-binding protein A schematic overview of the in vitro φ29 DNA replication mechanism is shown in Fig. 1 B. Initiation of φ29 DNA replication occurs via a so-called protein-primed mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 3Salas M. Rojo F. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1993: 843-858Google Scholar, 4Salas M.

Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The TP-containing DNA ends constitute the origins of replication. Initiation of DNA replication starts by recognition of the origin by a heterodimer formed by the φ29 DNA polymerase and the primer TP. The DNA polymerase then catalyzes the addition of the first dAMP to the primer TP. Next, after a transition step, these two proteins dissociate, and the DNA polymerase continues processive elongation until replication of the nascent DNA strand is completed. Replication, which starts at both DNA ends, is coupled to strand displacement. This results in the generation of so-called type I replication intermediates consisting of full-length double-stranded φ29 DNA molecules with one or more single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) branches of varying lengths. When the two converging DNA polymerases merge, a type I replication intermediate becomes physically separated into two type II replication intermediates. Each of these consists of a full-length φ29 DNA molecule in which a portion of the DNA, starting from one end, is double-stranded, and the portion spanning to the other end is single-stranded. Over the last decades convincing evidence has been presented that replication of bacterial genomes, including that of resident plasmids and infecting phages, occurs at the bacterial cell membrane (for review, see Ref. 7Firshein W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 89-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Also, replication of φ29 DNA takes place at the membrane of the infected cell (2Meijer W.J.J. Lewis P.J. Errington J. Salas M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4182-4190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Ivarie R.D. Pène J.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Bravo A. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gene 16.7, present in the early expressed operon located at the right side of the φ29 genome (see Fig. 1 A), encodes an integral membrane protein of 130 amino acids. The efficiency of in vivo φ29 DNA replication is affected in the absence of protein p16.7 (10Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this work we analyzed the functional role of p16.7 in φ29 DNA replication using purified p16.7A, a soluble variant of p16.7 lacking the N-terminal transmembrane-spanning domain. We found that protein p16.7A can functionally substitute the φ29 SSB p5 in in vitroφ29 DNA amplification assays, suggesting that it is a ssDNA-binding protein. This inference was further supported by direct assays such as electron microscopy and gel retardation studies. Thus, in addition to a classical SSB p5, φ29 encodes a membrane-localized ssDNA-binding protein. Contrary to the SSB p5, p16.7A has no helix-destabilizing activity, and p16.7 is not synthesized in stoichiometric amounts in infected cells. These and other results show that p16.7 and SSB p5 have non-overlapping functions. Based on the properties determined in this work together with the features described before, it is most likely that p16.7 attaches φ29 DNA to the membrane of the infected cells by binding to the stretches of ssDNA present in the replication intermediates. B. subtilis 110NA (trpC2, spoOA3,su− (11Moreno F. Camacho A. Viñuela E. Salas M. Virology. 1974; 62: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)) was used as the non-suppressor strain for φ29 infections. Cells, grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 5 mm MgSO4, were infected with phage φ29 mutant sus14(1242) (12Jiménez F. Camacho A. de la Torre J. Viñuela E. Salas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 73: 57-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Phage φ29 sus14(1242) contains a suppressor-sensitive mutation in gene 14 that encodes the holin gene. As a consequence, cell lysis is delayed, which allowed determination of the amounts of p16.7 and SSB at late stages in the infection cycle. The mutation has no effect on phage DNA replication or phage morphogenesis and, therefore, is considered as wild-type phage in these studies.

All DNA manipulations were carried out according to Sambrook et al. (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Qiaex gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). PCR reactions were carried out with proofreading-proficient Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using conditions as described before (10Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Isogen Bioscience BV (Maarsen, The Netherlands). Protein p16.7A was overexpressed and purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column as described before (10Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These assays were performed as described before (14Serna-Rico A. Illana B. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40529-40538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures of the φ29 TP-DNA replication assays contained the indicated amount of protein p16.7A or SSB p5. The amplification assays were stopped after an incubation period of 20 min. Replication reactions were carried out in the absence or in the presence of p16.7A or SSB p5 as described below. After 30 min at 30 °C the samples were stopped by adding 0.05 volumes of 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (200 μg/ml in 100% ethanol) on ice. The samples were then irradiated with 366-nm UV light on ice for 1 h with 2 psoralen additions, as described by Sogo and Thoma (15Sogo J.M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These cross-linking conditions were sufficient to produce essentially complete cross-linking of the DNA molecules in the absence of protein. After psoralen cross-linking, the samples were digested with proteinase K (500 μg/ml) for 2 h at 56 °C and extracted with phenol, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Denaturation and spreading of the psoralen cross-linked DNA for electron microscopy were carried out according the BAC technique, as described by Sogoet al. (16Sogo J.M. Stasiak A. DeBernadin W. Losa R. Koller T. Sommerville J. Scheer U. Electron Microscopy in Molecular Biology. A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 61-79Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken with a Philips 420 electron microscope at 80 kV, routinely at a magnification of 20,000-fold. Unless stated otherwise, the incubation mixtures contained, in a final volume of 20 μl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 4% Ficoll 400, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, the indicated labeled DNA fragment, and the indicated amount of protein p16.7A or φ29 SSB p5. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide (80:1) gels containing 12 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA and run at 4 °C using a running buffer containing 12 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA at 70 V for 6 h. Next, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Twenty μg of protein p16.7A was subjected to a 15–30% linear glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol and run as described before (14Serna-Rico A. Illana B. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40529-40538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After fractionation of the gradient, aliquots of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and gel retardation assays. Oligonucleotide degradation assays and the helix destabilization assays, the latter using 125 ng of primed M13mp18 DNA, were carried out as described by Gascón et al. (17Gascón I. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide −40 Universal and the same with a 5′ (5 thymidines) or a 3′ (5 adenines) extension were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 37 °C. To determine the intracellular levels of the viral proteins p16.7 and SSB throughout the course of the φ29 infection cycle, B. subtilis cells were infected with phage φ29 mutant sus14(1242) as described above. At different times after infection, 1.5-ml samples were withdrawn and processed as described before (10Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Known amounts (ng) of the corresponding purified proteins (p16.7A or SSB p5) were run in the same gel to determine the standard curve. Polyclonal antisera from rabbits against φ29 p16.7 or against φ29 SSB p5 were diluted 2,500 and 1,000 times, respectively. Previous results show that the absence of protein p16.7 affects the efficiency of in vivo φ29 DNA replication, especially at early infection times (10Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Protein p16.7 might stimulate φ29 DNA replication by enhancing the rate-limiting step of initiation of DNA replication. To study this possibilityin vitro, φ29 DNA replication initiation assays were performed in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of purified p16.7A. Although efficient initiation requires the presence of φ29 template TP-DNA, the DNA polymerase is also able to carry out the TP-deoxynucleotidylation reaction in the absence of TP-DNA (18Blanco L. Bernad A. Esteban J.A. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1225-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in vitro φ29 DNA initiation experiments were performed in reaction mixtures either lacking or containing template TP-DNA and in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of protein p16.7A. No significant effect of p16.7A on the initiation reactions was obtained (not shown), indicating that p16.7A plays no role in thein vitro initiation of φ29 DNA replication. The possibility that p16.7A has a role in φ29 DNA replication after the initiation step was analyzed by studying the possible effects of protein p16.7A in an in vitro φ29 DNA amplification system. This system, which allows the amplification of very low amounts of φ29 template DNA, requires the following four φ29-encoded proteins: DNA polymerase, TP, double-stranded DNA-binding protein p6, and the SSB p5 (19Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Bonnin A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12198-12202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has been described that omission of SSB p5 from the reaction mixtures results in the generation (19Blanco L. Lázaro J.M. de Vega M. Bonnin A. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12198-12202Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and amplification (20Esteban J.A. Blanco L. Villar L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2921-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) of short φ29 DNA products. Esteban et al. (20Esteban J.A. Blanco L. Villar L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2921-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the short φ29 DNA products are of palindromic nature and that they are caused by a DNA polymerase template-switching event during replication. Binding of SSB p5 to the displaced stretches of ssDNA present in type I DNA replication intermediates avoids the DNA polymerase to switch template, thus preventing the generation of short DNA products. Interestingly, we found that the addition of increasing amounts of protein p16.7A to reaction mixtures lacking SSB p5 resulted in the synthesis of increasing amounts of full-sized φ29 DNA and a concomitant decrease in the amounts of short DNA products (Fig.2). In fact, the generation of the short DNA products was fully prevented when the reaction mixtures contained 14 or 28 μm protein p16.7A. These results show that, under the conditions tested, the presence of protein p16.7A prevents the DNA polymerase from switching template and, therefore, that it can functionally substitute the SSB p5. The most likely explanation for these results is that the p16.7A protein binds to the stretches of displaced ssDNA present in the type I replication intermediates. The amount of full-sized φ29 DNA synthesized in the presence of 14 or 28 μm protein p16.7A is slightly lower than that compared in the presence of 7 μm. Probably, this decrease is due to binding of protein p16.7A to double-stranded φ29 template DNA at these elevated p16.7A concentrations (see below), causing a small effect on the efficiency of the φ29 DNA amplification. Psoralen can cross-link portions of a dsDNA molecule that are free of protein (15Sogo J.M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as well as folded-back regions in ssDNA (21Wollenzien P.L. Gasparro F.P. Psoralen-DNA Photobiology. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 51-85Google Scholar). The presence of the φ29 SSB p5 was shown to prevent the displaced ssDNA of the φ29 DNA replication intermediates from psoralen cross-linking, demonstrating that it binds to ssDNA (22Gutiérrez C. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Gutiérrez C. Martı́n G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol.

To study whether protein p16.7A indeed binds to the ssDNA portions of φ29 DNA replication intermediates, as indicated by the results of the φ29 DNA amplification assays described above, we used the psoralen cross-linking technique. Thus, φ29 DNA replication reactions, carried out in the absence or presence of either protein p16.7A or SSB p5, were treated with psoralen as described under “Materials and Methods.” Next, after the reaction products were treated with proteinase K, extracted with phenol, and purified, they were spread under denaturing conditions and analyzed by electron microscopy. As expected, in all three samples full-length dsDNA molecules with one or more ssDNA tails (type I) and full-length DNA molecules formed by a dsDNA portion of variable length from one DNA end plus an ssDNA portion spanning to the other DNA end (type II) were observed. A representative type I replication intermediate of each sample is shown in Fig.3. As described before (22Gutiérrez C. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 983-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Gutiérrez C. Martı́n G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the displaced ssDNA regions of replication intermediates produced in the absence (Fig. 3 A) or the presence of SSB p5 (Fig.3 C) appeared as collapsed and well unfolded structures, respectively. Fig. 3 B shows that the ssDNA portions in replication intermediates produced in the presence of protein p16.7A also had a well unfolded structure. These results, therefore, show that protein p16.7A, like the SSB p5, prevents the ssDNA from psoralen cross-linking, demonstrating that it binds to the ssDNA portions of the replication intermediates generated during φ29 DNA replication. Binding of p16.7A to ssDNA was further analyzed by gel mobility shift assays. For this purpose, the 175-base pair right-end fragment of the φ29 genome was end-labeled with 32P (see “Materials and Methods”), heat-denatured, and used in gel retardation assays in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of purified protein p16.7A. Although retardation of the ssDNA fragment was observed in the presence of 45 nm p16.7A, full retardation of all the ssDNA molecules required a p16.7A concentration of 360 nm (Fig. 4 A). Similar results were obtained with various other DNA fragments (results not shown). To gain an insight in the global ssDNA binding of p16.7A compared with that of the well studied φ29 protein p5, the experiment shown in Fig. 4 A was carried out in parallel using purified SSB p5. Whereas in agreement with previously published results (25Martı́n G. Lázaro J.M. Méndez E. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3663-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26Soengas M.S. Esteban J.A. Salas M. Gutiérrez C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Gascón I. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 989-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), some retardation of part of the ssDNA molecules occurred in the presence of 3.3 μm SSB p5, full retardation of all the ssDNA molecules required a concentration of 13.3 μm(Fig. 4 B). Together, these results show that the ssDNA binding activity of p16.7A is about 50 times higher than that of the φ29 SSB. To study possible binding of protein p16.7A to dsDNA, the same fragment of the φ29 genome used in Fig. 4, A andB, but in its double-stranded form, was used in gel retardation assays. The results, presented in Fig. 4 C, show that p16.7A binds to dsDNA, although the amount of p16.7A required to obtain full retardation of all the dsDNA molecules was about 20-fold higher than that required to bind the same DNA molecules in their single-stranded form. The observation that a smear of retarded DNA species is observed at low p16.7A concentrations (45–180 and 180–720 nm for ss- and dsDNA, respectively) indicates that the nucleoprotein complex formed at these concentrations is rather unstable. In addition, the increasing mobility shift caused by the various concentrations of p16.7A protein analyzed suggests the binding of more than one protein molecule per DNA molecule. This inference is further supported by the findings that a considerable amount of protein p16.7A is required (i) to prevent the generation of short ssDNA products in amplification assays lacking the SSB p5 (see above) and (ii) to cover the complete circular M13 ssDNA in order to prevent binding of the φ29 DNA polymerase (see below). To confirm that the observed retardation was due to protein p16.7A and not to a possible minor contaminant, the purified p16.7A protein was subjected to a glycerol gradient, after which aliquots of the gradient were analyzed for ssDNA binding by gel retardation. The results presented in Fig. 4 D show that the ssDNA binding activity was restricted to those fractions that contained protein p16.7A. The following approach was used to study possible binding of p16.7A to circular ssDNA. The φ29 DNA polymerase has strong affinity for naked ssDNA (28Blanco L. Bernad A. Lázaro J.M. Martı́n G. Garmendia C. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8935-8940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not bind ssDNA when it is covered with the SSB p5 (17Gascón I. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gutiérrez C. Martı́n G. Sogo J.M. Salas M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2104-2111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, free φ29 DNA polymerase, but not when bound to M13 ssDNA, can degrade a single-stranded oligonucleotide due to its 3′-5′ exonucleolytic activity. M13 DNA that is complexed with an ssDNA-binding protein, therefore, is unable to trap the φ29 DNA polymerase, which can be measured by the 3′-5′ exonucleolytic activity. Thus, φ29 DNA polymerase was added to either naked M13 ssDNA or the M13 ssDNA that was preincubated with increasing amounts of protein p16.7A. Then, 1 min after a 5′ labeled oligonucleotide was added to the mixtures, samples were analyzed for degradation of the oligonucleotide. The assays were carried out in parallel using SSB p5. Fig.5 shows, as expected, that the oligonucleotide was degraded by the φ29 DNA polymerase when the M13 ssDNA trap was omitted (lane 2), but it was not degraded when the reaction mixtures contained naked M13 ssDNA (lane 3). In agreement with previously published results (17Gascón I. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), preincubation of the M13 ssDNA with increasing amounts of SSB p5 resulted in increasing levels of degradation of the oligonucleotide (lanes 4–7). Similar results were obtained when the M13 ssDNA had been preincubated with protein p16.7A (lanes 9–12). The oligonucleotide was not degraded when it was only incubated with the highest concentration of SSB p5 or p16.7A (lanes 8 and 13, respectively). This excludes the possibility that the observed degradation of the oligonucleotide would be the consequence of a contaminant exonuclease in the purified protein preparations. These results, therefore, indicate that protein p16.7A binds to circular M13 ssDNA and that this prevents it from φ29 DNA polymerase binding. Possible helix destabilization activity of protein p16.7A was studied by its ability to displace a 5′-labeled 17-mer oligonucleotide hybridized to its complementary sequence in circular M13 ssDNA molecules. This substrate was incubated without or with increasing amounts of protein p16.7A, after which the samples were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The experiments were carried out in parallel using φ29 SSB p5. As shown in Fig. 6, incubation in the absence of protein did not result in release of the labeled oligonucleotide, indicating that the hybrid substrate was stable throughout the experiment. In agreement with previously published results (17Gascón I. Lázaro J.M. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2034-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Soengas M.S. Gutiérrez C. Salas M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the φ29 SSB p5 was able to displace the labeled oligonucleotide from the M13 DNA. However, no displacement of the oligonucleotide was detected when the hybrid substrate was incubated with protein p16.7A up to a concentration of 112 μm. To facilitate the oligonucleotide displacement, these assays were also performed using an oligonucleotide that contained, in addition to the 17 complementary nucleotides, either a non-complementary 5′- (5 thymidines) or a 3′- (5 adenines) tail. Contrary to the SSB p5, protein p16.7A was also unable to displace these oligonucleotides (results not shown). Because protein p16.7A is able to bind M13 ssDNA (see above), these results strongly suggest that protein p16.7A has no helix-destabilizing activity. The φ29-encoded TP and the DNA polymerase are the only two proteins required in a minimal in vitro φ29 DNA replication system (29Blanco L. Salas M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6404-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Contrary to the φ29 DNA amplification system, the minimal replication system requires high concentrations of template TP-DNA and is limited to one or two rounds of φ29 DNA replication. To study a possible effect of protein p16.7A in this system, in vitroφ29 DNA replication assays were performed in the absence or presence of protein p16.7A using the SSB p5 as a control. The amount of incorporated [α-32P]dAMP was determined (Fig.7 A), after which the samples were subjected to alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the size of the synthesized DNA (Fig. 7 B). As reported previously (23Gutie"
https://openalex.org/W1988535162,"Some neurotransmitter-gated ion channels are very much more sensitive to general anesthetics than others, even when they are genetically and structurally related. The most striking example of this is the extreme sensitivity of heteromeric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to inhalational general anesthetics compared with the marked insensitivity of the closely related homomeric neuronal nicotinic receptors. Here we investigate the role of the α subunit in determining the anesthetic sensitivity of these receptors by using α3/α7 chimeric subunits that are able to form functional homomeric receptors. By comparing the sensitivities of a number of chimeras to the inhalational agent halothane we show that the short (13 amino acids) putative extracellular loop connecting the second and third transmembrane segments is a critical determinant of anesthetic sensitivity. In addition, using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that two particular amino acids in this loop play a dominant role. When mutations are made in this loop, there is a good correlation between increasing anesthetic sensitivity and decreasing acetylcholine sensitivity. We conclude that this extracellular loop probably does not participate directly in anesthetic binding, but rather determines receptor sensitivity indirectly by playing a critical role in transducing anesthetic binding into an effect on channel gating.

One of these is why some ion channels are so much more sensitive to general anesthetics than others. For example, most voltage-gated ion channels are relatively unaffected by clinically relevant concentrations of general anesthetics, in contrast to a number of ligand-gated ion channels that show a high degree of anesthetic sensitivity (1Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar). However, even among the ligand-gated channels, great variations in anesthetic sensitivity can be found (2Harris R.A. Mihic S.J. Dildy-Mayfield J.E. Machu T.K. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Krasowski M.D. Harrison N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1278-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Such differences are, of course, particularly intriguing when they occur between two closely related members of a superfamily. This is the case, for example, with GABAA1 and GABAC receptors (members of a superfamily that also contains nACh, glycine, and 5-HT3 receptors) (4Unwin N. Neuron. 1993; 10: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar) whose very different responses to general anesthetics have been elegantly explored using chimeric receptors and site-directed mutagenesis (5Mihic S.J.

This work led to the identification of key molecular determinants of sensitivity for ethanol and certain inhalational anesthetics (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E.

However, uncertainty remains as to whether these determinants represent the anesthetic binding sites themselves or critical regions involved in transducing the binding event into an effect on channel gating. Within the same superfamily, other examples of contrasting anesthetic sensitivities exist. Indeed, one of the most striking is the remarkable sensitivity of the heteromeric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors to inhalational anesthetics (11Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) compared with the robust insensitivity of the muscle-type receptor (11Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) or the homomeric α7 neuronal receptor (12Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L.

Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the present study we have, using an approach similar to that used previously with GABA receptors (5Mihic S.J. Ye Q. Wick M.J. Koltchine V.V. Krasowski M.D. Finn S.E. Mascia M.P. Valenzuela C.F. Hanson K.K. Greenblatt E.P. Harris R.A. Harrison N.L. Nature. 1997; 389: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar), tried to determine at the molecular level why homomeric α7 nicotinic ACh receptors differ so greatly in their anesthetic sensitivity from their heteromeric counterparts (e.g. α3β4 receptors). We have sought to simplify the analysis by focusing specifically on the role of neuronal α-type subunits in determining anesthetic sensitivity by using chimeric α3/α7 constructs that form functional homomeric receptors in the absence of a β-type subunit. Such constructs have already been exploited to determine which parts of the α subunit are involved in receptor assembly (14Garcia-Guzman M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Vicente-Agullo F. Rovira J.C. Campos-Caro A. Rodriguez-Ferrer C. Ballesta J.J. Sala S. Sala F. Criado M.

Adult femaleXenopus laevis frogs (Blades Biological, Cowden, Kent, UK), maintained in freshwater holding tanks at 20–22 °C, were anesthetized by immersion in a 0.2% (w/v) solution of tricaine (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, methanesulfonate salt). Portions of the ovaries were surgically removed and teased apart with forceps. These portions were then briefly washed in “calcium-free” oocyte incubation buffer (calcium-free OIB; composition in mm: NaCl, 88; KCl, 1;, NaHCO3, 2.4; MgSO4, 0.8, HEPES 15; titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH) before incubation in the same saline containing collagenase (Sigma, type 1A; 2 mg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature with constant agitation. After careful washing in calcium-free OIB to remove traces of collagenase, the oocytes were transferred into normal OIB (composition in mm: NaCl, 88; KCl, 1; NaHCO3, 2.4; MgSO4, 0.8; CaCl2, 0.4; Ca(NO3)2, 0.3; HEPES 15, titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH). Oocytes at stages 5–6 of development were then chosen for injection by visual inspection. Selected oocytes were injected with 10 nl of TE buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, titrated to pH 8.0 with NaOH) containing 10 ng of RNA, using a calibrated micropipette (10–16 μm tip diameter) and a Picospritzer II valve (General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ), which provided short pressure pulses of nitrogen gas. In cases where constructs were co-injected with the bovine β4 subunit (19Campos-Caro A. Smillie F.I. Dominguez del Toro E. Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agullo F. Chapuli J. Juiz J.M. Sala S. Sala F. Ballesta J.J. Criado M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), equal amounts of each RNA were mixed together prior to injection in the usual manner. Injected oocytes were maintained in a cooled incubator (BDH, Poole, Dorset, UK) at 19–20 °C in normal OIB containing antibiotics (penicillin, 50 IU/ml; streptomycin, 50 μg/ml; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in individual wells (200 μl per well) of 96-well microtitre plates (Invitrogen) for 2–10 days prior to use. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). The construction of the chimeras is described elsewhere (14Garcia-Guzman M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2709-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chimeras were constructed using bovine α7 and α3 subunits, and the numbering scheme is exactly as used previously (see TableI). The C19 chimera, which consisted of the α7 sequence from the N terminus to the end of M1 and the α3 sequence thereafter, also contained the α3/α7 mutation L268D, because without this change this chimera has been shown to be inactive. Capped RNA transcripts were prepared using the preparatory Riboprobe IITM kit in conjunction with the SP6 RNA polymerase enzyme (Promega, Southampton, UK). The resulting pelleted RNA samples were resuspended in nuclease-free TE buffer, pH 8.0 (prepared using Milli-Q water previously treated with diethyl polycarbonate), to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Single-use aliquots of the individual RNAs were then stored at −80 °C until required. The integrity of DNA and RNA samples was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.Table IDetails of chimerasThe amino acid numbering refers to the appropriate subunit, α3 or α7. Open table in a new tab The amino acid numbering refers to the appropriate subunit, α3 or α7. Site-specific changes were made using the QuikChangeTM kit supplied by Stratagene (Westburg, The Netherlands). Short complementary primers (25–45 base pairs) containing the desired sequence changes (up to 4 bases/primer) for both DNA strands were designed for each of the desired mutations. These were then synthesized by Oswel (Southampton, UK) or Sigma-Genosys (Pampisford, Cambridgeshire, UK) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography or gel electrophoresis before use. Successful mutants were selected by inclusion, or where appropriate exclusion, of specific restriction sites in the final DNA using silent mutations incorporated with the site directed changes in the DNA. Changes were subsequently confirmed by sequencing of the template (Oswel, Southampton, UK). Ionic currents evoked by bath application of acetylcholine (0.1 μm to 3 mm) were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique with an Axoclamp 2A amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Pipettes were fabricated from thin-walled filamented borosilicate glass capillary tubes (GC150TF, Clark Electromedical Instruments, Reading, Berkshire, UK) using a two-stage pull (David Kopf Instruments vertical pipette puller, Model 720, Tujunga, CA). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (the current-passing electrode also contained 100 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N′-tetraacetic acid) and had typical resistances of 0.4–0.8 MΩ. Currents were filtered at 5 Hz (−3 dB, 8-pole Bessel filter; Frequency Devices, model 902, Haverhill, MA) before being digitized and stored on a computer. The saline used for electrophysiological recordings had the following composition (mM): NaCl, 110; KCl, 2; MgCl2, 1; BaCl2, 2; and HEPES, 10 (titrated to pH 7.5 with NaOH). In addition, all solutions contained 100 nm atropine to block any endogenous muscarinic responses. Experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). Solutions of halothane were made up as fractions of a saturated solution at room temperature. The concentration of the saturated solution was taken to be 17.5 mm (21Raventós J. Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1956; 11: 394-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Reservoirs containing the solutions were sealed with a rigid plastic float, and all tubing and valves were made of polytetrafluoroethylene. With these precautions, losses of volatile agents from the perfusion system were found to be negligible when measured by gas chromatography. Halothane was obtained from ICI Ltd., Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK. Responses were normalized to individually chosen standard concentrations of ACh for each of the constructs tested. These standards were periodically re-applied during experiments to allow compensation for variation in the response (run-up and/or run-down) where appropriate. In most experiments each application of ACh, and halothane where applicable (which was pre-applied for 60 s), was performed in duplicate to ensure that the compounds tested had reached equilibrium and a true reflection of their activity had been achieved. The effects of halothane on ACh-gated currents were rapidly and fully reversible, and halothane on its own rarely had any significant effect on the resting current. Concentration-response data for ACh and halothane were numerically fitted to standard Hill equations, using the method of unweighted least squares. For activation by a concentrationA of ACh, I/I max = 1/[1 + (EC50/A)n], where I is the current and I max the maximum current, EC50 is the ACh concentration that yields 50% of the maximum current, and n is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). For inhibition by a concentration H of halothane, I/I cont = 1/[1 + (H/IC50)n], where I andI cont are the ACh-activated currents in the presence and absence of halothane, respectively, IC50 is the halothane concentration that gives 50% of the control current, andn is the slope factor (Hill coefficient). Values throughout the paper are given as means ± S.E. Acetylcholine receptors composed of a mixture of α3and β4 subunits were very sensitive to the inhalational general anesthetic halothane (see Fig. 1and Table II), with the ACh-induced current being inhibited by between 80 and 90% at the minimum alveolar concentration (∼250 μm halothane for mammals (22Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Br. J. Anaesth. 1993; 71: 65-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar)), the concentration required to inhibit a response to a painful stimulus in 50% of a population of animals (23Quasha A.L.

The inhibition appeared to be largely noncompetitive, because the halothane inhibition changed little with acetylcholine concentration (see lower panel of Fig. 1). However, there was also a degree of competitive inhibition; we found that the apparent dissociation constant for ACh increased from a control value of 122 ± 6 μm to a value of 257 ± 76 μm in the presence of 175 μm halothane (see upper panel of Fig. 1). In terms of anesthetic sensitivity, homomeric ACh receptors composed solely of α7 subunits were about 1 order of magnitude less sensitive to halothane (see Fig. 2and Table II), with no significant effect at the minimum alveolar concentration. Inhibition did occur at higher halothane concentrations, and this inhibition was noncompetitive (see Fig. 2). In addition, the slope parameters of the halothane concentration-response curves for the α7 homomer (Fig. 2 and Table II) were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than those for the α3β4 heteromer (Fig. 1 and Table II).Table IIAcetylcholine and halothane concentration-response parameters for α3β4 and α7 receptorsAcetylcholineHalothane2-aAcetylcholine concentration = 1 mm.SubunitEC50Slope parameter (n)IC50Slope parameter (n)μmμmα3β4122 ± 61.6 ± 0.183 ± 41.4 ± 0.1α773 ± 151.0 ± 0.2860 ± 603.8 ± 0.82-a Acetylcholine concentration = 1 mm.

We sought to identify such a region using chimeras consisting of portions of the α3 receptor together with portions of the α7 receptor. It should be noted that the related, but logically distinct, question of identifying regions of the α subunit, which determine anesthetic sensitivity is more difficult to address using this strategy. This is because the α3 subunit can only form functional anesthetic-sensitive receptors in the presence of a β subunit, whereas the α7 subunit can form anesthetic-insensitive homomers on its own, and the β subunit might play a role in conferring anesthetic sensitivity in heteromeric receptors (see below). The data in Fig. 3 show that a chimera (C3) containing the large extracellular domain from the α7 subunit was even more sensitive to halothane than the α3β4 receptor, so that this large domain was clearly not responsible for the anesthetic insensitivity. Furthermore, the insensitivity of the chimera C7 (Fig. 3), which contains the C-terminal half of the large extracellular domain from α3, is consistent with the notion that the large extracellular domain does not contain key sites that determine anesthetic sensitivity. A chimera (C21) that consisted of the α7 sequence from the N terminus to the start of the putative transmembrane domain M3 was found to be relatively insensitive to halothane (26 ± 3% inhibition at 175 μm halothane). This result, taken together with the sensitivity of the chimera C3 (94.3 ± 1.5% inhibition at 175 μm halothane), suggests that insensitivity can be conferred by a region from the start of M1 to the start of M3. A chimera (C19) that consisted of the α7sequence from the N terminus to the end of the putative transmembrane domain M1 was found to be very sensitive to halothane (see Fig.4), indicating that the α7M1 transmembrane domain could not confer insensitivity. From this analysis we can conclude that between the end of M1 and the start of M3 there must be amino acids in the α3 sequence that, when mutated to their α7 counterparts, would be capable (either alone or in some combination) of conferring anesthetic insensitivity. This region contains a short extracellular loop between the putative transmembrane domains M2 and M3 that has been identified as being particularly important in modulating the gating behavior of acetylcholine receptors (16Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6118-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Rovira J.C. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 439: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate this loop in further detail to determine whether this region could also modulate halothane sensitivity. Table III shows the amino acid sequences of the putative extracellular loop between the transmembrane segments M2 and M3 for the anesthetic-sensitive C19 chimera and the anesthetic-insensitive α7 receptor. The sequences in this region differ at five sites, and so five mutants were made in which the C19 amino acid was replaced by its α7 counterpart. For each of these mutants the ACh concentration-response curve was constructed and the halothane sensitivity determined. Only two of the mutations substantially affected the halothane sensitivity (I263M and V269S), while the other point mutations only modestly reduced sensitivity (Table IV). However, when these two mutations were combined, the halothane sensitivity was greatly affected. Fig. 5 shows ACh and halothane concentration-response curves for the double mutant (I263M,V269S). The noncompetitive element of the inhibition observed with halothane and the C19 chimera was completely removed, although a degree of competitive inhibition remained. In addition, the double mutation also greatly increased the sensitivity of the receptor to ACh (Table IV). An almost identical picture emerged when the putative extracellular loop in the C19 chimera between 261 and 273 was replaced by the α7 sequence with the resulting receptor showing no noncompetitive inhibition by halothane and yet a greatly enhanced sensitivity to ACh (see last line of Table IV). As with the double mutant, the competitive element of the inhibition remained, with the control apparent dissociation constant for ACh increasing from 1.04 ± 0.18 μm to 2.5 ± 0.1 μmin the presence of 175 μm halothane.Table IIIAmino acid sequences in the putative extracellular loop between transmembrane segments M2 and M3261262263264265266267268269270271272273C19 chimeraETIPSTSDVIPLIα7EIMPATSDSVPLI259260261262263264265266267268269270271 Open table in a new tab Table IVAcetylcholine concentration-response parameters and halothane sensitivities for the C19 chimera and its mutantsAcetylcholineHalothane, % inhibition4-aInhibition of maximal response to ACh by 175 μm halothane.SubunitEC50Slope parameter (n)μmC19 chimera24.7 ± 0.82.5 ± 0.391.2 ± 0.5T262I23.3 ± 1.52.6 ± 0.581.1 ± 3.1I263M11.9 ± 1.61.1 ± 0.145.9 ± 3.2S265A22.8 ± 2.32.4 ± 0.582.6 ± 1.0V269S6.65 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.362.8 ± 3.1I270V19.1 ± 1.71.8 ± 0.383.9 ± 2.8V269S,I270V8.73 ± 1.22.2 ± 0.460.6 ± 2.3I263M,V269S1.58 ± 0.122.1 ± 0.23.7 ± 5.1T262I,I263M,S265A, V269S,I270V1.04 ± 0.181.8 ± 0.5−2.5 ± 7.34-a Inhibition of maximal response to ACh by 175 μm halothane. Open table in a new tab To assess the role of the β subunit in determining anesthetic sensitivity, we made the double mutation (I263M and V269S) in the native α3 subunit and co-expressed this with the native β4 subunit. The resulting heteromeric receptor showed a sensitivity to halothane that was intermediate between the mutated C19 homomer and the native α3β4 heteromer. At a high ACh concentration (1 mm), 175 μmhalothane inhibited the response of the heteromeric receptor containing the mutated α3 subunit by 42 ± 3%, compared with an inhibition of 77 ± 2% for the heteromer containing the native subunits. Interestingly, as with the native combination, the inhibition of the heteromeric receptor containing the mutated α3subunit was mixed in nature, with the apparent affinity for ACh increasing from a control value of 109 ± 4 μm to 297 ± 70 μm in the presence of 175 μmhalothane. Inspection of the ACh and halothane sensitivities for the various C19 mutants showed an obvious correlation (r = 0.95) between the two (Fig. 6) with increasing anesthetic sensitivity being well correlated with decreasing ACh sensitivity (i.e. increasing ACh EC50). Having identified those amino acids in the extracellular loop that could confer anesthetic insensitivity on the C19 chimera, we next made the reverse mutations in the α7 subunit in an attempt to confer anesthetic sensitivity. All of our attempts to do this, however, were unsuccessful. For example, the double reverse α7mutant (M263I,S269V) showed exactly the same degree of halothane insensitivity as had the native α7 homomer (data not shown), and all the other single and double mutations we made produced only relatively small effects on halothane sensitivity. Neuronal nACh receptors are members of an anesthetic-sensitive superfamily (4Unwin N. Neuron. 1993; 10: 31-41PubMed Google Scholar, 24Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. J. Clin. Anesth. 1996; 8: S3-S7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) of fast neurotransmitter-gated ion channels (that also includes the GABAA, glycine, and 5-HT3receptors). They are present in the nervous system as both α homomers and αβ heteromers, the latter being probably the most sensitive targets for volatile general anesthetics that have yet been identified. Over the range of concentrations likely to be encountered clinically, volatile general anesthetics would be expected to inhibit the heteromeric neuronal nACh receptors very substantially (11Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although significant effects would be seen at concentrations well below those needed to induce a loss of consciousness, it remains to be determined how these relate to behavioral facets of the anesthetic state. The sensitivity of the heteromeric receptors appears to extend across species with mammalian and chick receptors being shown to be equally sensitive (11Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 12Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the α3β4 bovine receptors by halothane reported here (Fig. 1) is entirely consistent with previous work. In contrast to the anesthetic-sensitive heteromeric receptors, homomeric receptors consisting only of α7 subunits are remarkably insensitive to volatile agents. This has been shown with the chick α7receptor (12Flood P. Ramirez-Latorre J. Role L. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Zhang L. Oz M. Stewart R.R. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and we show here (Fig. 2) that this also extends to mammalian receptors. This insensitivity is not absolute, of course, and at sufficiently high concentrations of halothane, the α7homomeric receptors can be completely inhibited, although the IC50 for this effect is approximately three times higher than the concentration (22Franks N.P. Lieb W.R. Br. J. Anaesth. 1993; 71: 65-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) needed to prevent a response to a painful stimulus (minimum alveolar concentration ∼ 250 μm). The main aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the α subunit in determining the different anesthetic sensitivities of homomeric α7 receptors and heteromeric αβ receptors. We felt that the insensitivity of the α7 homomer was unlikely to be simply due to its homomeric nature per se, because we have previously shown that heteromeric αβγδ muscle-type receptors are equally insensitive to volatile anesthetics in an identical expression system (11Violet J.M. Downie D.L. Nakisa R.C. Lieb W.R. Franks N.P. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 866-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To focus on the role of the α subunit, we have exploited the fact that functional homomeric receptors can be formed which are composed of various portions of α7 and α3 subunits, provided certain key parts of the α7 subunit are retained (14Garcia-Guzman M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Vicente-Agullo F. Rovira J.C. Campos-Caro A. Rodriguez-Ferrer C. Ballesta J.J. Sala S. Sala F. Criado M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These chimeras have proved to be extremely valuable for not only identifying those amino acids that are required for homomer formation (14Garcia-Guzman M. Sala F. Sala S. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15198-15203Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Vicente-Agullo F. Rovira J.C. Campos-Caro A. Rodriguez-Ferrer C. Ballesta J.J. Sala S. Sala F. Criado M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but also for determining regions in the receptor that are important for channel gating (16Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6118-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Rovira J.C. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Campos-Caro A.

Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 439: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A previous study that was also deliberately restricted to homomeric receptors was that of Zhang et al. (13Zhang L. Oz M. Stewart R.R. Peoples R.W. Weight F.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), who compared the anesthetic sensitivities of nACh α7 receptors, which are inhibited by volatile anesthetics and 5-HT3 receptors, which are potentiated. They also constructed a homomeric nACh/5-HT3 chimera and concluded that the inhibitory site on the nACh α7 receptor must be contained somewhere on the N-terminal extracellular domain. While there is no reason to doubt this conclusion, there is equally no compelling reason for believing that the site, or sites, responsible for the inhibition of the α7 receptor (which is relatively insensitive) and those responsible for the supersensitivity of the heteromeric receptors are one and the same. Indeed, the significantly different slopes of the halothane concentration-response curves (see Table II) suggest a different stoichiometry and/or degree of co-operativity of the interactions. Moreover, the chimera C3, which contains almost the entire α7 extracellular domain, was even more sensitive to halothane than the α3β4 heteromer, strongly suggesting that the inhibitory site(s) on the α7 receptor is quite different to the site or sites responsible for the inhibition of the α3β4 heteromer. Taken together with the insensitivity of chimera C7 we can safely conclude that the key determinant(s) of the anesthetic sensitivity of the C3 chimera must lie within the four putative transmembrane segments M1–M4 and/or their interconnecting loops. The C19 chimera, similar to C3 except that the α7sequence continued until the end of M1, was as sensitive as the C3 chimera, indicating that the α7 sequence from the N terminus up to the end of M1 was unable to confer anesthetic insensitivity. However, when the sequence was extended to the start of M3, the resulting chimera (C21) was insensitive, suggesting a region or regions between the end of M1 and the start of M3 was responsible for anesthetic insensitivity. This region contains one position in the sequence that has recently been identified (25Yamakura T. Borghese C. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40879-40886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as being important in affecting the anesthetic sensitivity of heteromeric receptors. This is an amino acid in the β subunit sequence that differs between β2 and β4 subunits and appears to be responsible for the enhanced sensitivity of β2-containing receptors over β4-containing receptors to gaseous and volatile agents. However, this amino acid is identical in the α3 and α7 sequences, so cannot be responsible for the differences in sensitivities being investigated here. The sequence between the end of M1 and the start of M3 also contains almost all of a putative extracellular region joining M2 and M3 (Table III), which has been shown to be important in channel gating (16Campos-Caro A. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Criado M. Sala F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6118-6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Rovira J.C. Ballesta J.J. Vicente-Agullo F. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Sala F. Sala S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 18Rovira J.C. Vicente-Agullo F. Campos-Caro A. Criado M. Sala F. Sala S. Ballesta J.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1999; 439: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate this region in more detail. At this point in the discussion it is worth emphasizing some of the logical constraints that govern the interpretation of our results. Specifically, our use of homomeric receptors means that we can only unambiguously identify those regions of the α7 subunit whose presence ensures anesthetic insensitivity. Moreover, and more importantly, the approach of using chimeras that are usually constructed with a single join means that single contiguous regions in the receptor that are important in determining anesthetic sensitivity will tend to be highlighted, if they exist. The approach is relatively ineffective, however, at identifying multiple amino acids that are distributed linearly along the primary sequence but which act together in determining anesthetic sensitivity by, for example, coming together to form an anesthetic binding site. What little high resolution crystallographic data there are on halothane binding to proteins (26Bhattacharya A.A. Curry S. Franks N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38731-38738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) suggest binding sites would most probably be formed by multiple amino acids separated along the primary sequence. Consequently, we thought it unlikely that the M2-M3 extracellular loop could, on its own, constitute a halothane binding site. Instead, it might be a region involved in transducing anesthetic binding into effects on channel gating. We therefore investigated the effects of changing amino acids in this region of the anesthetic-sensitive chimera C19 to their counterparts in the α7 sequence on both acetylcholine EC50 and anesthetic sensitivity. We found that two point mutations (I263M and V269S) caused a marked change in halothane sensitivity and that the double mutant resulted in a receptor almost as insensitive (at least at high ACh concentrations) as the α7 homomer, as did the complete replacement of the M2-M3 loop on the C19 chimera by its α7 counterpart. From these observations it can be concluded that this putative extracellular loop is a critical determinant of the halothane insensitivity of the α7 receptor. Moreover, it appears that mutations in the M2-M3 extracellular loop specifically affect the noncompetitive component of the inhibition, leaving any competitive inhibition unchanged. Confirmation of this came from our results with the α3β4 heteromer when the double mutation was made in the α3 subunit. The mutations caused a reduction in the noncompetitive component of the inhibition seen with the native α3β4 receptor, while the competitive component was unaffected. The fact that the double mutation did not completely remove the noncompetitive component of the inhibition of the α3β4 heteromer indicates that the β subunit must also play a significant role in the determination of anesthetic sensitivity (25Yamakura T. Borghese C. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40879-40886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our inability to confer halothane sensitivity on the α7 receptor by making the reverse mutations in the M2-M3 loop shows that other regions of the α subunit must also be involved in determining anesthetic sensitivity. Interestingly, a striking correlation was evident (Fig. 6) between the extent to which mutations in this region reduced anesthetic sensitivity and the extent to which they increased ACh sensitivity (i.e. reduced the ACh EC50). The fact that mutations in this region affected ACh sensitivity was no great surprise. This is because, as mentioned above, this domain has been identified as being important in channel activation by ACh, and naturally occurring mutations in this region in the muscle-type nACh receptor (associated with myasthenia gravis) and glycine receptors (associated with startle disease) have also been shown to affect channel activation (27Zhou M. Engel A.G. Auerbach A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10466-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 28Moorhouse A.J. Jacques P. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, critical amino acids in the M2-M3 loop in the GABAA α subunit have recently been shown (29O'Shea S.M. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22764-22768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to greatly alter GABA EC50 values, and it seems highly probable that this loop plays an important role in transducing agonist binding into channel gating. However, the strong correlation we have found between ACh insensitivity and halothane sensitivity was quite unexpected. How can this observation be interpreted in terms of anesthetic binding? Two extreme alternatives are possible: 1) the M2-M3 extracellular loop is a region that is critically important in transducing anesthetic binding (at some distant site) into receptor inhibition, and mutations in this region affect this transduction, or 2) the loop forms part of an anesthetic binding site and mutations directly disrupt anesthetic binding. While it is difficult to unambiguously rule out either of these possibilities, the fact that mutations in the M2-M3 loop cause such large (up to 20-fold) changes in ACh apparent affinity, and that these changes correlate with halothane sensitivity (Fig. 6), tends to argue against the interpretation that the M2-M3 loop interacts directly with the halothane molecule. Had this extracellular loop formed part of the halothane binding site, one might have expected mutations in this region to have changed halothane binding without greatly changing the apparent affinity for ACh. This is because the halothane inhibition of the α3β4 receptor and the anesthetic-sensitive chimeras are largely noncompetitive in nature; in other words, there appears to be no strong allosteric link between halothane binding and the apparent affinity for ACh. The most straightforward interpretation of our results, therefore, is that the M2-M3 extracellular loop in the α subunit plays a critical role in determining the halothane sensitivity of nACh receptors, and this is most likely because this domain is involved in the transduction of anesthetic binding to channel inhibition. To what extent this critical domain determines the sensitivity of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors to other general anesthetics will be the subject of future studies. We are very grateful to Raquel Yustos and Andrew Plested for help with making some of the mutants."

However, epidermal keratinocytes cease to differentiate and proliferate when the calcium concentration is reduced to 0.05–0.1 mm (3Stanley J.R. Yuspa S.H. J.

Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 10Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 11Montminy M.

The well characterized coactivators, CREB (cAMP response element binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP associated factor (P/CAF), integrate gene expression with many transcription activators through two distinct mechanisms. One is the association with and recruitment of the transcriptional machinery, which targets promoters (12Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M.

The other is their intrinsic enzymatic activity, histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which transfers an acetyl-base to the ε-portion of lysine residues on histones (15Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L.

Cell. 1996; 84: 817-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Their involvement has been explained by the destabilization of the interaction of hyperacetylated histone with DNA causing modification of chromatin structure, which facilitates the access of transcriptional activators to their cognate DNA-binding sites (20Hebbes T.R. Thorne A.W. Crane-Robinson C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 21Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that HATs, acting as factor acetyl transferases (FATs), also acetylate molecules other than histones, such as p53, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor, and transcription factor (for RNA polymerase) II E, which often results in increased transcriptional activity (22Gu W.

We investigated the association between calcium-induced HAT activation and the differentiation of keratinocytes. Nuclear acetylation (NA) in response to calcium stimulation was examined using a specific antibody against ε-acetylated lysine (AK) (36Kawahara K. Watanabe S. Ohshima T. Soejima Y. Oishi T.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, penicillin G, streptomycin, non-essential amino acids, glutamine, and ascorbic acid were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY), FCS from HyClone Inc. (Logan, UT), and calcium chloride from Wako pure chemical industries Ltd. (Kobe, Japan). The protein kinase C inhibitors, Go6983 and GF109203X, were purchased fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (San Diego, CA); anti-human involucrin monoclonal antibody was from Novocastra Laboratories Ltd. (Newcastle, UK); and anti-human CBP antibody, anti-P/CAF antibody, and anti-promyelocytic leukemia (pml) gene product (PML protein) antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). [14C]Acetyl CoA and [32P]dATP were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Buckinghamshire, UK), and double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing AP-1 binding element were from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-AK antibody against the ε-portion of lysine residues was developed as reported previously (36Kawahara K. Watanabe S. Ohshima T. Soejima Y. Oishi T. Aratani S. Nakata M. Shibata M. Inoue K.

Briefly, keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated AK was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant, and the suspension was injected intradermally into 10 female Japanese white rabbits. An immunogen of the same quality was also administered five times, once every other week. The IgG fraction was collected from serum using a protein A column. This antibody reacts specifically with the ε-portion of AK but not with the α-portion of AK or non-AK (36Kawahara K. Watanabe S. Ohshima T. Soejima Y. Oishi T. Aratani S. Nakata M. Shibata M.

HaCaT cells were provided by Dr. L. Matrisian (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) with the permission of Dr. Nobert E. Fusening (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). HaCaT cells are a non-tumorigenic immortalized keratinocyte line, which was derived from normal skin, and they have maintained substantial differentiation potential in culture (37Boukamp P.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar) with some modifications. They were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (without calcium and magnesium), 100,000 units/liter penicillin G, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 292 mg/liter glutamine, 50 mg/liter ascorbic acid, and 10% calcium-depleted FCS (6Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). The calcium concentration in the medium was adjusted to various levels by adding an appropriate volume of 280 mm calcium chloride. Mutations in P/CAF and CBP were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quik-Change mutagenesis system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were designed such that the wild type sequence corresponding to amino acids Tyr597/Phe598 in P/CAF cDNA were substituted with alanines to generate a mutant of P/CAF lacking HAT activity (pCMV-PCAF HAT-). A similar strategy was used to obtain mutants of CBP. Mutant P/CAF and CBP were expressed in bacteria and tested for HAT activity using histones as substrates (data not shown). Hemagglutinin-tagged (HA) PML protein expression plasmid was made by reverse transcription-PCR-based cloning into pcDNA3-HA (38Miyagishi M. Fujii R. Hatta M. Yoshida E. Araya N. Nagafuchi A.

For transient transfection, 2 μg of DNA was diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). 10 μl of LipofectAMINE and 8 μl of plus reagent (Invitrogen) were also diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM. After 5 min at room temperature, the two solutions were mixed and incubated for 20 min to allow complex formation. The mixture was then directly added to 2 ml of antibiotic-free medium, which was on the cells plated on glass coverslips. The medium was changed 5 h after addition of the transfection mixture, and the cells were grown for 24 h in medium containing 0.05 mm calcium after which the medium was replaced with medium containing 1.2 mm calcium. After transfection, the cells were grown for 2 days before analysis of ectopic protein abundance. Liquid assays for HAT activity were performed as described by Brownell and Allis (39Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) with some modification. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (40Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cell layers (5 × 106) were harvested with a cell scraper, washed with PBS, and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmPMSF. Then Nonidet P-40 solution (0.6% final concentration) was added, and the cells were mixed vigorously for 15 s and centrifuged for 30 s at 12,000 × g. Pelleted nuclei were suspended in buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol), mixed for 20 min, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. The nuclear extract reaction mixtures containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 mm butyric acid, and 20% glycerol were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 125 nCi of [14C]acetyl CoA and 10 mg/ml histones (Sigma-Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) and then subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was autoradiographed at −80 °C for 4–7 days using Kodak X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Western blotting was performed as described previously (12Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 10 μg of whole cell or nuclear extracts from HaCaT cells were subjected to 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with blocking solution consisting of 1% BSA and 5% low fat milk in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and then was reacted with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing three times with T-TBS for 10 min each at 25 °C, the membrane was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-rat IgG (1:3000 dilution). Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immunostaining with the indicated antibodies was performed with HaCaT cells cultured in four wells of a Lab-Tech chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Cambridge, MA). Cells were fixed at −20 °C for 30 min with 100% methanol. The slides were treated for 1 h with a blocking buffer consisting of 1% BSA in PBS, incubated with the indicated antibodies for 1 h, and then washed three times with PBS. The primary antibodies were detected by treating for 30 min with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for AK, with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for involucrin and P/CAF and with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG for HA (1:200 dilutions). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. IP was performed as described previously (12Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼500 μg of nuclear extracts was incubated for 1 h with 5 μg of anti-CBP or anti-P/CAF antibody in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL (pH 7.6), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). Complexes were bound to 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The agarose beads were washed three times with IP buffer and were eluted with reaction mixture for HAT assays or boiled in loading buffer for Western blotting. EMSAs were performed as described previously (41Nakajima T. Kitajima I. Shin H. Takasaki I. Shigeta K. Abeyama K. Yamashita Y. Tokioka T. Soejima Y. Maruyama I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 950-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA-protein reaction mixtures (20 μl) consisted of buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 25 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm PMSF), 15 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.28 ng of radiolabeled probe of consensus sequence for AP-1 binding element in the presence or absence of a molar excess of cold probe. Mixtures were incubated at 22 °C for 20 min. Samples were loaded onto non-denaturing high ionic strength polyacrylamide gels. After running at 150 V for 1 h, the gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) at −80 °C. To investigate whether HAT enzymes in HaCaT cells are activated by calcium stimulation, cells were cultured in 0.05 mm calcium and the calcium concentration was increased to 1.2 mm. The time course of HAT activity in nuclear extracts after increasing calcium is shown in Fig. 1. Although a trace of HAT activity was detected under low calcium (0.05 mm) conditions, it was induced significantly by 1.2 mm calcium with a maximum activity at 2 h. Although HAT activity gradually decreased after 2 h, it was still detected weakly at 16 h. This result suggests that HAT activation could be involved in the calcium-induced signaling pathway in HaCaT cells. Because HAT activity is correlated with NA (36Kawahara K. Watanabe S. Ohshima T. Soejima Y. Oishi T. Aratani S. Nakata M. Shibata M. Inoue K. Amano T. Fujii R. Yanai K. Hagiwara M. Fukamizu A. Maruyama I. Nakajima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using anti-AK antibody we next examined the time course of NA resulting from high calcium (1.2 mm) treatment. As shown in Fig.2 A, two types of acetylated nuclear proteins (∼70 and 97 kDa designated ap70 and ap97) were detected by Western blotting of the nuclear extracts of cells grown in 0.05 mm calcium. Subsequently, ap70 gradually decreased. In low calcium ap97 was detected but to a lesser extent than ap70. It was transiently induced by high calcium with a maximum at 2 h after stimulation and then it decreased. The time course of ap97 was fairly consistent with that of HAT activity shown in Fig. 1. When cells were treated with 1.2 mm calcium, acetylation of a 78-kDa protein, designated ap78, was induced. In contrast to ap70 and ap97, ap78 was not detected in low calcium, but was expressed for 16 h in high calcium. Thus, calcium clearly changed the status of NA. Next we examined the morphological changes resulting from calcium stimulation. Phase-contrast microscopy showed that cells growing as monolayers in low calcium (0.05 mm) attached to each other tightly after 16 h of culture with high calcium (1.2 mm), indicating cornified stratification (Fig.2 B, left panel). Calcium induces epidermal cell differentiation and keratinocyte differentiation markers such as involucrin, filaggrin, loricrin, and transglutaminase (4Rice R.H. Green H. Cell. 1979; 18: 681-694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 5Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 42Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells show normal keratinization and expression of differentiation markers, including involucrin, in high calcium medium (37Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). Involucrin, a structural component of mature squamous epithelium, is incorporated into the marginal band as part of the formation of the protein envelope that characterizes squamous cells immediately prior to terminal differentiation (43Murphy G.F. Flynn T.C. Rice R.H. Pinkus G.S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1984; 82: 453-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of calcium using antibodies against involucrin and AK. As shown in Fig. 2 B(right panel), although involucrin was not detected in HaCaT cells after 2 h in both low and high calcium, it was induced after 16 h of culture in high calcium, indicating the differentiation of HaCaT cells. Stronger NA was detected in cells cultured for 2 and 16 h in high calcium compared with those cultured in low calcium. The acetylation status in the nucleus was correlated with calcium-induced involucrin expression. These results again suggest that HAT activation and the consequent NA are associated with calcium-dependent keratinocyte differentiation Calcium induces the expression of keratinocyte differentiation marker genes through the PKC signaling pathway (8Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its concentration affects HAT activity and the NA pattern. These facts prompted us to examine the effects of Go6983 and GF109203X, specific PKC inhibitors, on HAT activity and the NA profile. Cells were incubated with or without Go6983 or GF109203X for 1 h prior to calcium treatment. Nuclear extracts were prepared at the indicated times after treatment with 1.2 mm calcium. HAT activity at 2 h and the time course of NA were examined. HAT activity was inhibited by both Go6983 and GF109203X (Fig.3 A). 20 nmGF109203X affected calcium-induced HAT activity more than 10 nm GF109203X, but no more significant effect on HAT activity was detected by 50 nm GF109203X than by 20 nm GF109203X. 10 nm Go6983 inhibited HAT activity more than 5 nm Go6983, and 60 nmGo6983 did not inhibit it completely. We performed IP assays to see if CBP and P/CAF are involved in calcium-induced HAT activation, and, if so, whether the HAT activities of CBP and P/CAF are suppressed by inhibition of PKC. CBP and P/CAF were purified from nuclear extracts using monoclonal anti-CBP and anti-P/CAF antibodies. The qualities of the purified proteins were confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown), and they were assayed for HAT activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Calcium induced the HAT activities of both CBP and P/CAF at 2 h, and these inductions were inhibited by GF109203X (Fig. 3 B). The inhibition of P/CAF HAT activity by 20 nm GF109203X was much greater than that of CBP. The effects of 20 nm GF109203X on NA stimulated by 1.2 mm calcium are shown in Fig. 3 C. Although the expression patterns of ap70 and ap78 were very similar to those without GF109203X (Fig. 2 A), surprisingly, ap97 was absent throughout the period examined (Fig. 3 C). These results indicate that conventional calcium-dependent PKC is involved in calcium-dependent HAT activation and that ap97 is the major component in this process. To determine more definitively whether P/CAF is important in calcium-induced HAT activation and keratinocyte differentiation, we introduced an active mouse HA-CBP with HAT activity or an inactive HA-CBP mutant and an active mouse FLAG-tagged (FLAG)-P/CAF or an inactive FLAG- P/CAF mutant into HaCaT cells by transient transfections. The transfection efficiency was 85% as indicated by the expression of a linked green fluorescence protein (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). Western blot analyses of nuclear extracts from transfected cells confirmed that there was sufficient expression of the ectopic proteins (Fig. 4 A, lower panel). We examined involucrin expression induced by calcium in the transfected cells after treating them with 1.2 mm calcium for 24 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.4 B, transfection with wild type CBP had little effect on involucrin expression and mutant CBP suppressed involucrin slightly. In contrast, transfection with P/CAF resulted in significant alterations in involucrin expression. Wild type P/CAF increased involucrin expression moderately and when the cells were transfected with mutant P/CAF, involucrin expression was repressed significantly. Furthermore, mutant P/CAF inhibited the expression of ap97 induced by treatment with 1.2 mm calcium for 2 h (Fig. 4 C). The expressions of ap70 and ap78 after stimulation with calcium were not affected by any of the transfections. Calcium-regulated involucrin gene expression is mediated in part by interaction of AP-1 transcription factors with an AP-1 site in the calcium response region of the involucrin promoter (44Ng D.C. Shafaee S. Lee D. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24080-24088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). EMSA using double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the consensus sequence of the AP-1 site, with nuclear extracts from HAT-active or -dead CBP and P/CAF transfectants, revealed that both mutants reduced AP-1 binding activity at 2 h after stimulation with 1.2 mm calcium (Fig. 4 D). P/CAF is not only required for the increased transcription of the involucringene. However, it is also possible that transcriptional factors other than AP-1 are required for optimal expression of the differentiation markers. These results provide evidence for the involvement of P/CAF in calcium-dependent keratinocyte differentiation via the PKC signaling pathway through acetylation of a 97-kDa nuclear protein. To determine whether P/CAF interacts with NA, we investigated the localization of NA and P/CAF in the nucleoli of HaCaT cells stimulated with 1.2 mm calcium. After 2 h of stimulation, cells were fixed and examined by indirect immunofluorescence staining. P/CAF was detected in HaCaT cells after calcium stimulation and was localized with NA (Fig.5, upper panel). The detection of NA after 2 h of stimulation with 1.2 mm calcium implies the existence of ap97. PML nuclear bodies are thought to be cellular regulatory domains where proteins such as CBP and CBP-interacting molecules may be activated or inactivated to coordinate signal-activated cellular responses (45Hodges M.

https://openalex.org/W1982185609,"Based on the kinetic model of substrate phage proteolysis, we have formulated a strategy for best manipulating the conditions in screening phage display libraries for protease substrates (Sharkov, N. A., Davis, R. M., Reidhaar-Olson, J. F., Navre, M., and Cai, D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 10788–10793). This strategy is exploited in the present study with signal peptidase SpsB from Staphylococcus aureus. We demonstrate that highly active substrate phage clones can be isolated from a phage display library by systematically tuning the selection stringency in screening. Several of the selected clones exhibit superior reactivity over a control, the best clone, SIIIRIII-8, showing >100-fold improvement. Because no conserved sequence features were readily revealed that could allow delineation of the active and unreactive clones, the sequences identified in five of the active clones were tested as synthetic dodecamers, Ac-AGX 8GA-NH2. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we show that four of these peptides can be cleaved by SpsB and that Ala is the P1 residue exclusively and Ala or Leu the P3 residue, in keeping with the (−3, −1) rule for substrate recognition by signal peptidase. Our successful screening with SpsB demonstrated the general applicability of the screening strategy and allowed us to isolate the first peptide substrates for the enzyme.

Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we show that four of these peptides can be cleaved by SpsB and that Ala is the P1 residue exclusively and Ala or Leu the P3 residue, in keeping with the (−3, −1) rule for substrate recognition by signal peptidase. Our successful screening with SpsB demonstrated the general applicability of the screening strategy and allowed us to isolate the first peptide substrates for the enzyme. Bacterial type I signal peptidase is responsible for cleaving the signal peptide from precursor proteins, and its activity is an integral part of the export and maturation of secreted proteins in vivo. The essential function of the enzyme to bacterial cell viability has been demonstrated using genetic approaches with both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (1Cregg K.M. Wilding I. Black M.T.

The reaction of signal peptidases with synthetic peptides, on the other hand, is not as well explored as with protein substrates.

For instance, peptide libraries were created by incorporating randomized sequences into the signal peptide of TEM-1 β-lactamase, varying six amino acid residues between −4 and +2 positions around the signal peptidase cleavage site (19Palzkill T., Le, Q.Q. Wong A. Botstein D. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 563-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional sequences were found to support the production of active TEM-1 but none better than the wild type. Reported more recently were combinatorial synthetic peptide libraries in which four positions, −4, −3, −2, and +2, were varied in the signal peptidase recognition sequence, and better than 10-fold improvements over the control were observed among the selected peptides (20Rosse G.

It is experimentally feasible to randomize up to eight amino acid residues in one library. Phage display has been successfully applied to proteases for selection and optimization of peptide substrates by way of optimizing the substrate phage (21Matthews D.J. Wells J.A. Science. 1993; 260: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 22Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we reported that the proteolysis of substrate phage is a single exponential process and provided the kinetic basis for how to control the rate of proteolysis to ensure the success of substrate phage selection (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The experimental design strategy we put forward is now exploited in the present study, where we applied it to the screening of an 8-mer phage display library with the type I signal peptidase SpsB from Staphylococcus aureus. By systematically tuning the screening stringency in the selection process, we discovered several active substrate phage clones. The sequences found in the most reactive clones were subsequently evaluated as synthetic peptides and characterized for their competency to serve as substrates for SpsB with respect to the substrate recognition and digestion kinetics.DISCUSSIONHaving an efficient in vitro assay not only can facilitate the biochemical study of an enzyme but is also imperative to inhibitor screens if the enzyme is a potential drug target. For an enzyme such as a protease, which catalyzes transformations to protein substrates under physiologic conditions, finding a peptide substrate is usually the first step toward achieving this goal, and phage display technology has been instrumental to the discovery of substrates for proteases.Substrate Phage ReactivityWe recently described the detailed kinetics for the proteolysis of substrate phage and provided a quantitative basis for the design of a phage library screening experiment (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We further formulated a screening strategy for meeting the desired outputs through the control of screening stringency. In the present study, we methodically applied the strategy to the signal peptidase SpsB from S. aureus and succeeded in finding reactive substrate phage for the enzyme, validating our screening strategy. In the five independent screening experiments performed, the screening stringency was controlled by varying the length of time the phage library was incubated with the enzyme. The incubation was as short as 30 min to as long as 24 h, but only when it was extended to 24 h did we start to uncover a significant number of active clones (Table I). The overall number of active clones was quite small, but it increased as we relaxed the screening stringency, confirming our prediction that a relaxed screening condition would facilitate the enrichment of reactive substrates (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We recognize that adopting such a condition is especially important for an enzyme like signal peptidase, which appears to have a low catalytic efficiency. The single-exponential kinetic process, which we described previously for the reaction of stromelysin with its substrate phage (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was shown here for the signal peptidase. Furthermore, the reaction of the signal peptidase with substrate phage obeyed pseudo-first-order kinetics (Fig.2), suggesting that the kinetic model developed using stromelysin (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) should be generally applicable to other enzymatic systems.Although the criterion we used to define the reactivity of a phage clone was somewhat arbitrary (Table I), the fraction of active clones identified out of the total number of colonies screened was apparently small, implying that only a small population of potential substrates for SpsB was present in the phage display library. The activity of the best clones was not especially high (Table II), and it proved difficult to achieve further enrichment probably due to the low abundance of potential substrates in the library. It is conceivable that the segment displayed on phage needs to be over eight residues long for it to be an efficient substrate for SpsB. In such a case, a phage display library of eight randomized residues would not be a rich source of substrate for SpsB.Peptide SubstrateWhile we were successful in finding active substrate phage for SpsB, the sequences of the phage clones did not readily allow the differentiation of the active from the unreactive. We found no plausible hints in the sequences that would allow prediction of the site of cleavage and therefore turned to synthetic peptides. The synthetic peptides were dodecamers, containing eight residues found in the variable region in addition to two flanking residues on each side from the constant region of the library. Using an LC/MS method to identify the proteolytic products, we found that all substrates were cleaved at the peptide bond at the C terminus of an Ala residue, which is consistent with Ala being the preferred P1 residue for signal peptidase, and that the cleavage pattern generally obeyed the (−3, −1) rule for substrate recognition by signal peptidase (9Perlman D. Halvorson H.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 10von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, 11von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is interesting that peptide 4 is cleaved at an Ala that is common to all phage clones and not in the variable region as seen with other peptides. It is very curious that peptide 1, derived from the most reactive phage clone, is completely resistant to cleavage by SpsB. One Ala residue found in the variable region of peptide 1 is N-terminally linked to a Pro. If peptide 1 were to be cleaved at this Ala by SpsB, it would place the Pro at the −2 position. The fact that we did not detect the digestion of peptide 1 at such a site is consistent with the current understanding that Pro is not allowed in the −3 to +1 region in the substrate for bacterial signal peptidase (5von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar, 11von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In light of how peptide 4 (and hence substrate phage clone SIRIII-30) was cleaved, it is conceivable that the digestion of substrate phage clone SIIIRIII-8 could also occur outside of the variable region.It is clear that the reactivity of the synthetic peptides correlated poorly with that of the corresponding phage (Table III), even if the results with peptide 1 were not taken into account. This finding reinforces our previous argument that such a correlation is not expected, since synthetic peptide and substrate phage are two different substrate entities, subjected to different kinetic rules (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Substrate phage is selected under single-turnover conditions, and any improvement in its reactivity would strictly affect the rate of substrate and enzyme binding. On the other hand, the activity of the peptide is usually assayed under steady-state conditions, and the substrate binding rate constant may be a small contributing factor to its overall catalytic efficiency.In general, peptides are known to be inefficient substrates for a signal peptidase such as the E. coli enzyme LepB (14Kuo D. Weidner J. Griffin P. Shah S.K. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8347-8354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Dev I.K. Ray P.H. Novak P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20069-20072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiencies of the peptide substrates for SpsB characterized in this study are not fundamentally different from those found for LepB (15Dev I.K. Ray P.H. Novak P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20069-20072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, K m for the most active peptide 4 (and most likely for peptide 2 as well) is still on the order of millimolar. Previous studies have shown that remarkable improvements in k cat/K m can be achieved when the peptide is modified so that it forms micelles, which enhance the enzyme and substrate interaction (26Stein R.L. Barbosa M.D. Bruckner R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7973-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); bothk cat and K m values were found to be improved to a level approaching that of a preprotein substrate (16Chatterjee S. Suciu D. Dalbey R.E. Kahn P.C. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to incorporate the various SpsB substrate sequences from this study into a micelle-forming peptide or a preprotein construct and to test what effect it would have on the peptide reactivity. One interesting observation with peptide 4 is that only one residue, an Ala at P1, is present on the P side of the substrate sequence. It is not known what is the minimal requirement for the sequence on the P′ side of the substrate molecule. In a previous attempt to define the minimal substrate, it was found that the E. coli enzyme could cleave peptides with a sequence encompassing −2 and +5 or −7 and +2 residues (15Dev I.K. Ray P.H. Novak P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20069-20072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of β-lactam-acylated LepB has been solved (27Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear from the structure what kind of interactions would exist in the active site for P′ residues on the substrate sequence. Evidently, more experiments are needed to probe the contribution of P′ residues to support the activity of a substrate like peptide 4.ConclusionsThis study shows that through systematic tuning of the selection stringency in screening phage display libraries, the isolation of highly reactive substrate phage clones for an enzyme like signal peptidase, which appears inefficient catalytically toward simple peptide substrates, can be achieved. It demonstrates the general applicability of the kinetic model of substrate phage proteolysis and the phage display library screening strategy that we described earlier (25Sharkov N.A. Davis R.M. Reidhaar-Olson J.F. Navre M. Cai D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10788-10793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These experiments resulted in the isolation of the first peptide substrates for signal peptidase SpsB from S. aureus and provided the first insight into the recognition of substrate cleavage site by the enzyme.

Recently, we reported that the proteolysis of substrate phage is a single exponential process and provided the kinetic basis for how to control the rate of proteolysis to ensure the success of substrate phage selection (25Sharkov N.A.

The experimental design strategy we put forward is now exploited in the present study, where we applied it to the screening of an 8-mer phage display library with the type I signal peptidase SpsB from Staphylococcus aureus. By systematically tuning the screening stringency in the selection process, we discovered several active substrate phage clones. The sequences found in the most reactive clones were subsequently evaluated as synthetic peptides and characterized for their competency to serve as subst"
