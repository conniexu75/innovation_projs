We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term ClearMap. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.

Neuronal activity in the brain is an ever-changing landscape. Signals processed from the outside world and internal organs are constantly shifting activity levels across brain regions to produce relevant responses. Significant efforts have been made in the past decade to record large ensembles of neurons to better understand the network dynamics underlying animal behaviors (Keller and Ahrens, 2015Keller P.J. Ahrens M.B. Visualizing whole-brain activity and development at the single-cell level using light-sheet microscopy.Neuron. 2015; 85: 462-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but obtaining a complete snapshot of the activity of all neurons in the mammalian brain has yet to be achieved. In mammals, large-scale neural activity can be recorded through the animal skull using electro-encephalogram recordings or functional MRI, and single-cell recording of large neuronal ensembles can be achieved with multi-channel silicon probes, which provide high temporal resolution, enabling precise discrimination of neuron types by firing patterns (Berényi et al., 2014Berényi A. Somogyvári Z. Nagy A.J. Roux L. Long J.D. Fujisawa S. Stark E. Leonardo A. Harris T.D. Buzsáki G. Large-scale, high-density (up to 512 channels) recording of local circuits in behaving animals.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 1132-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Optical techniques, coupled with GCaMP calcium probes, provide live recording of neuronal activity over larger volumes, including activity of most neurons in zebrafish larva brain (Ahrens et al., 2012Ahrens M.B. Li J.M. Orger M.B. Robson D.N. Schier A.F. Engert F. Portugues R. Brain-wide neuronal dynamics during motor adaptation in zebrafish.Nature. 2012; 485: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and several thousand neurons in the mouse cortex (Peron et al., 2015Peron S.P. Freeman J. Iyer V. Guo C. Svoboda K. A Cellular Resolution Map of Barrel Cortex Activity during Tactile Behavior.Neuron. 2015; 86: 783-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, because of the size and optical properties of the mouse brain, it is not currently possible to image in vivo deeper than the cortex, although deeper structures can be made accessible using fiber optics, endoscopes (Cui et al., 2014Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Luo G. Pham M.D. Lovinger D.M. Vogel S.S. Costa R.M. Deep brain optical measurements of cell type-specific neural activity in behaving mice.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), or by surgically removing the cortex (Lovett-Barron et al., 2014Lovett-Barron M. Kaifosh P. Kheirbek M.A. Danielson N. Zaremba J.D. Reardon T.R. Turi G.F. Hen R. Zemelman B.V. Losonczy A. Dendritic inhibition in the hippocampus supports fear learning.Science. 2014; 343: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), although at the expense of the field of view. To assess neuronal activity in regions less accessible to live imaging, immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-fos, whose expression levels reflect recent changes in neuronal activity, have often been used as proxies. The first in vivo example of c-fos-induced expression in neurons was reported in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord following a nociceptive stimulus (Hunt et al., 1987Hunt S.P. Pini A. Evan G. Induction of c-fos-like protein in spinal cord neurons following sensory stimulation.Nature. 1987; 328: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Since then, the upregulation of expression of IEGs like c-fos, arc, egr-1, fosb, and npas4 has been used as a surrogate for neuronal activity in most neuronal systems and in most regions of the brain. Because they rely on translational machinery, IEGs have low temporal resolution. Upregulation of their expression usually lags neuronal stimulation by ∼30 min and their expression can outlast the end of activity by over 4 hr (Barnes et al., 2015Barnes S.J. Sammons R.P. Jacobsen R.I. Mackie J. Keller G.B. Keck T. Subnetwork-specific homeostatic plasticity in mouse visual cortex in vivo.Neuron. 2015; 86: 1290-1303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so IEGs can be considered to encode a short-term memory trace of the activity (Denny et al., 2014Denny C.A. Kheirbek M.A. Alba E.L. Tanaka K.F. Brachman R.A. Laughman K.B. Tomm N.K. Turi G.F. Losonczy A. Hen R. Hippocampal memory traces are differentially modulated by experience, time, and adult neurogenesis.Neuron. 2014; 83: 189-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although highly informative (Mongeau et al., 2003Mongeau R. Miller G.A. Chiang E. Anderson D.J. Neural correlates of competing fear behaviors evoked by an innately aversive stimulus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3855-3868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), unbiased analyses of IEGs expression in the brain are painstakingly arduous to perform, and their low throughput limits their implementation. Serial two-photon tomography (STP) represents a current standard for automated whole-brain histological analysis using fluorescent reporters (Ragan et al., 2012Ragan T. Kadiri L.R. Venkataraju K.U. Bahlmann K. Sutin J. Taranda J. Arganda-Carreras I. Kim Y. Seung H.S. Osten P. Serial two-photon tomography for automated ex vivo mouse brain imaging.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) and was more recently used to map c-Fos expression in the mouse brain in an automated way by imaging endogenous GFP fluorescence in a c-Fos-GFP reporter line to comprehensively analyze complex social behaviors (Kim et al., 2015Kim Y. Venkataraju K.U. Pradhan K. Mende C. Taranda J. Turaga S.C. Arganda-Carreras I. Ng L. Hawrylycz M.J. Rockland K.S. et al.Mapping social behavior-induced brain activation at cellular resolution in the mouse.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 292-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, STP tomography-based IEG mapping also has disadvantages. First, it requires advanced instrumentation that is not readily available to most laboratories. Second, there are only a few fluorescent IEG reporter mice and these have some limitations compared to the detection of native IEGs. For example, the Arc-GFP mouse is a genetic knockin with only one Arc allele remaining active (Wang et al., 2006Wang K.H. Majewska A. Schummers J. Farley B. Hu C. Sur M. Tonegawa S. In vivo two-photon imaging reveals a role of arc in enhancing orientation specificity in visual cortex.Cell. 2006; 126: 389-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), while the Arc-dVenus and c-Fos-GFP mice possess transgenes with short promoters that may not exactly replicate the intricate regulation of activity-driven induction in all brain areas. Last, a complete recording of all c-Fos+ cells is not possible with STP, as single 2D planes are sampled only every 50 to 100 μm from the block, leaving undocumented gaps between each section. Whole-brain detection of native IEGs would allow the analysis of IEGs for which there are no transgenic reporters and likely improve the reliability of the detection of the arc and c-fos gene products. In fact, whole-brain activity mapping with IEGs without sectioning has been shown to be a powerful approach to investigate brain regions active in freely moving zebrafish larvae using image registration (Wee et al., 2015Wee C.L. Naumann E.A. Nnaemeka O. Schoppik D. Fitzgerald J.E. Portugues R. Lacoste A.M.B. Riegler C. Schier A.F. Randlett O. et al.Whole-brain activity mapping onto a zebrafish brain atlas.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), but the extension of this approach to the much larger mammalian brain has not to date been achieved. Recently, renewed interest in tissue clearing techniques and volume imaging has driven the development of several families of protocols to perform histological analysis in intact samples (Richardson and Lichtman, 2015Richardson D.S. Lichtman J.W. Clarifying tissue clearing.Cell. 2015; 162: 246-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Those techniques are now starting to enable the streamlined analysis of axonal projections or cell positions in intact mouse brains in a manual or semi-automated way (Lerner et al., 2015Lerner T.N. Shilyansky C. Davidson T.J. Evans K.E. Beier K.T. Zalocusky K.A. Crow A.K. Malenka R.C. Luo L. Tomer R. Deisseroth K. Intact-brain analyses reveal distinct information carried by SNc dopamine subcircuits.Cell. 2015; 162: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, Menegas et al., 2015Menegas W. Bergan J.F. Ogawa S.K. Isogai Y. Umadevi Venkataraju K. Osten P. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum form an anatomically distinct subclass.eLife. 2015; 4: e10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Schwarz et al., 2015Schwarz M.K. Scherbarth A. Sprengel R. Engelhardt J. Theer P. Giese G. Fluorescent-protein stabilization and high-resolution imaging of cleared, intact mouse brains.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0124650Google Scholar). We reasoned that volume imaging using light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) coupled with tissue clearing could be a powerful alternative to STP for imaging IEG expression in the intact brain. Imaging IEG expression in the intact brain using the Arc-dVenus fluorescent reporter has been reported along the publication of the CUBIC method and its expanded protocol (Susaki et al., 2014Susaki E.A. Tainaka K. Perrin D. Kishino F. Tawara T. Watanabe T.M. Yokoyama C. Onoe H. Eguchi M. Yamaguchi S. et al.Whole-brain imaging with single-cell resolution using chemical cocktails and computational analysis.Cell. 2014; 157: 726-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, Susaki et al., 2015Susaki E.A. Tainaka K. Perrin D. Yukinaga H. Kuno A. Ueda H.R. Advanced CUBIC protocols for whole-brain and whole-body clearing and imaging.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 1709-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). We recently developed iDISCO, a method to immunolabel and image large intact samples, including adult brain (Renier et al., 2014Renier N. Wu Z. Simon D.J. Yang J. Ariel P. Tessier-Lavigne M. iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 896-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The ability to immunolabel many samples in parallel and the extremely high transparency achieved makes iDISCO well-suited to map endogenous IEG expression in all brain regions at a higher throughput compared to STP and with greater versatility, thereby complementing the use of transgenic reporters in other whole-brain imaging methods. To enable automated brain-wide analysis of IEGs, it was, however, necessary to develop a new iDISCO-based pipeline on three fronts:•First, we improved the iDISCO protocol to reduce sample shrinkage and better preserve brain morphology, thereby enabling automated registration of the LSFM-imaged sample onto a reference brain atlas for automated comparisons; the resulting protocol is termed iDISCO+.•Second, we optimized parameters to obtain a near isotropic resolution of ∼5 μm (4.065 × 4.065 × 3 μm/pixel) by horizontally scanning the light sheet over a 7 × 7 × 6 mm region of the mouse brain in 1 hr at a cellular resolution, using an average of 20 Gb per sample.•Third, we developed “ClearMap,” a computer program based solely on open-source components and compatible with a desktop workstation that is applied to the imaging data to count cells in 3D, registers them onto a reference atlas, and generates distribution maps and statistical analysis of intact mouse brains in <1 hr per sample. The power and utility of the resulting pipeline is highlighted here in three applications: (1) to document brain regions activated in response to an anti-psychotic drug, haloperidol; (2) to search for brain regions differentially activated when mice explore a new environment with or without using their whiskers; and (3) to correlate neuronal projections with activity, illustrated by tracing projections from the galanin-expressing neurons of the medial pre-optic area to map activity in its target regions during parenting behavior in the mouse. The original iDISCO protocol for immunolabeling and brain clearing permits detection of immunolabeled structures throughout the intact adult mouse brain and is compatible with a wide variety of antibodies to diverse epitopes (Renier et al., 2014Renier N. Wu Z. Simon D.J. Yang J. Ariel P. Tessier-Lavigne M. iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 896-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In particular, it is compatible with antibodies that detect a variety of IEGs (see below). Specific signals are detected using secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa fluorophores that emit in the far-red spectrum (647 nm laser excitation), to which the cleared brain is essentially transparent (Renier et al., 2014Renier N. Wu Z. Simon D.J. Yang J. Ariel P. Tessier-Lavigne M. iDISCO: a simple, rapid method to immunolabel large tissue samples for volume imaging.Cell. 2014; 159: 896-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In the blue-green spectrum (480 nm laser excitation), intrinsic tissue fluorescence highlights the major structures in the brain, such as myelinated tracts, cortical regions, and various deep nuclei (Figures 1B and S1A), thus providing a counterstain without the need for counterstaining (Movie S1).Figure S1Light-Sheet c-Fos Signal Imaging of Clearing Samples in the Forebrain, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Field of view covered by the camera sensor at the 1.6X magnification.

Scale bars are 1mm (A) and 80 μm (C). Building on iDISCO, we developed ClearMap, a cell detection and registration pipeline outlined in Figure 1A and Movie S2, which relies on key improvements in iDISCO sample preparation and imaging procedures, as follows. First, we optimized imaging conditions to achieve the minimal x,y,z pixel size of 4.06 × 4.06 × 3 μm/pixel necessary to image a large field of view at cellular resolution while still preserving acquisition speed and a relatively low data footprint (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S1). We found that imaging at 1.6× with a 2× 0.5NA objective and continuous horizontal scanning of the light sheet provided a resolution sufficient to image single c-Fos positive cells within the sharp center of the lens, which covers the length of the entire mouse forebrain in sagittal orientation (Figure S1A). At this magnification, the optical maximal resolution is almost isotropic at the center of the imaging lens (Figures 1E and S2) so that images acquired in one plane can be combined to give an undistorted representation in the other orthogonal planes. The measured z resolution (thickness) of the light sheet at the numerical aperture used (0.1) is ∼5 μm at its thinnest point (LaVision Biotec’s information). To maximize the z resolution throughout the dorso-ventral length of the brain, the thinnest focal point of the light sheet was horizontally scanned, and a composite image was created for each plane by using a contrast projection, thus circumventing the Gaussian shape of the beam. While the camera sensor field of view (10.4 mm in length) and the tiling of three parallel light sheets covers the mouse brain in sagittal orientation from the cerebellum to the olfactory bulb, the sharp center of the imaging lens covers a smaller region (7.2 mm in length), which limits the region covered by one tile to the forebrain excluding the olfactory bulbs (Figure S3A). However, the consistency of the sharpness and signal intensity for detected cells throughout this region suggested that it could be possible to build a robust pipeline to automatically analyze the distribution of IEGs within the brain (Figures S1B and S1C).Figure S3Implementation of a Simple Illumination Correction, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) description of the loss of signal intensity and resolution with regard to the position within the field of view due to spherical optical aberrations.

Second, several efficient 3D image registration software packages have recently been developed. As mentioned, the intrinsic tissue fluorescence highlighting major structures (Figures 1B and S1A) offers enough detail and contrast to allow in principle for automated registration of scans using signals harvested with the 480 nm laser excitation. However, tissue distortion due to shrinkage during 3DISCO (Ertürk et al., 2012Ertürk A. Becker K. Jährling N. Mauch C.P. Hojer C.D. Egen J.G. Hellal F. Bradke F. Sheng M. Dodt H.U. Three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs using 3DISCO.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 1983-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) clearing (when used after the iDISCO staining) precluded automated image registration (Menegas et al., 2015Menegas W. Bergan J.F. Ogawa S.K. Isogai Y. Umadevi Venkataraju K. Osten P. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum form an anatomically distinct subclass.eLife. 2015; 4: e10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). We traced the major source of shrinkage to tetrahydrofuran used in the 3DISCO protocol and were able to modify the protocol to dispense with this chemical, replacing it with a combination of methanol and dichloromethane (Figure 1B). With this novel iDISCO protocol, which we term iDISCO+, only minor tissue deformation occurred (see below). The clearing performance of iDISCO+ enables imaging of c-Fos+ cells with a consistent signal throughout the working distance of the objective, well over 6 mm deep in the tissue (Figures S1A and S1B). There was no drop in the number of c-Fos+ cells detected throughout the imaging depth, as the density of c-Fos+ cells was identical on both sides of the midline (Figure S1B). We verified that the new clearing protocol remains compatible with all tissues and has an identical clearing performance to that seen with iDISCO/3DISCO (Figure S4G and data not shown). The ClearMap pipeline includes interfaces to the Elastix open-source software (Klein et al., 2010Klein S. Staring M. Murphy K. Viergever M.A. Pluim J.P.W. elastix: a toolbox for intensity-based medical image registration.IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 2010; 29: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2655) Google Scholar, Shamonin et al., 2014Shamonin D.P. Bron E.E. Lelieveldt B.P.F. Smits M. Klein S. Staring M. Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging InitiativeFast parallel image registration on CPU and GPU for diagnostic classification of Alzheimer’s disease.Front. Neuroinform. 2014; 7: 50PubMed Google Scholar) to automatically register the iDISCO+ light sheet scans, as previously developed for STP-imaged mouse brains (Kim et al., 2015Kim Y. Venkataraju K.U. Pradhan K. Mende C. Taranda J. Turaga S.C. Arganda-Carreras I. Ng L. Hawrylycz M.J. Rockland K.S. et al.Mapping social behavior-induced brain activation at cellular resolution in the mouse.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 292-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We quantified the extent of deformation by registering light-sheet scans of cleared half-brains to matched MRI scans of the same samples (Figures 1C, S4A, and S4B). The optimized affine transformation coefficients determined by Elastix indicate a modest linear reduction in size of 7% and 9% in the medio-lateral and rostro-caudal axis respectively and a small linear expansion of 5% along the dorso-ventral axis (n = 5). The overall volume shrinkage as determined by the determinant of the transformation matrix was 11%, down from the reported 50% shrinkage observed with the original 3DISCO clearing protocol (Richardson and Lichtman, 2015Richardson D.S. Lichtman J.W. Clarifying tissue clearing.Cell. 2015; 162: 246-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). For whole brains, which require a little distortion to fit in the MRI tube, we observed similar but smaller coefficients when registering whole brains to the STP reference atlas (5% volume difference, n = 6, Figure S4B), suggesting that whole-brain morphology may be better preserved during clearing. The average displacement after applying the optimized non-linear (b-spline) transformation from the sample to the reference was 4 voxels (Figure 1C). Most of the non-linear transformations corrected for a small expansion of the ventricular volume and adjustment of the cortical curvature. The new clearing protocol therefore enabled image registration of the cleared samples datasets to the STP reference (STPR) mouse brain aligned to the Allen Brain 25 μm reference Atlas, whereas the original clearing protocol would have required custom reference Atlases (Kim et al., 2015Kim Y.

We next developed a complete suite of open-source image processing tools within our modular ClearMap software to detect cells in 3D and register their coordinates onto the reference atlas, which has a similar workflow to previously used analysis pipelines (Kim et al., 2015Kim Y. Venkataraju K.U. Pradhan K. Mende C. Taranda J. Turaga S.C. Arganda-Carreras I. Ng L. Hawrylycz M.J.

To validate the detected accuracy, the cell detection was run on a dataset for which positive cell voxels were manually annotated by two users. The filters and threshold were tuned until the disagreement ratio between the manual and automated annotation was similar to the ratio between the two users (Figures 1F and S5C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures). As iDISCO+ relies on immunostaining, it offers flexibility when choosing the IEGs used to map brain activity. To test the ability of the method to detect the induction of known IEGs, we relied on activity evoked in the barrel cortex by whisker stimulation as a tool to validate antibodies for c-"

Using CRISPR interference, we created knockdowns of every essential gene in Bacillus subtilis and probed their phenotypes. Our high-confidence essential gene network, established using chemical genomics, showed extensive interconnections among distantly related processes and identified modes of action for uncharacterized antibiotics. Importantly, mild knockdown of essential gene functions significantly reduced stationary-phase survival without affecting maximal growth rate, suggesting that essential protein levels are set to maximize outgrowth from stationary phase. Finally, high-throughput microscopy indicated that cell morphology is relatively insensitive to mild knockdown but profoundly affected by depletion of gene function, revealing intimate connections between cell growth and shape. Our results provide a framework for systematic investigation of essential gene functions in vivo broadly applicable to diverse microorganisms and amenable to comparative analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2397429809,"Recent advances in single-particle cryoelecton microscopy (cryo-EM) are enabling generation of numerous near-atomic resolution structures for well-ordered protein complexes with sizes ≥ ∼200 kDa. Whether cryo-EM methods are equally useful for high-resolution structural analysis of smaller, dynamic protein complexes such as those involved in cellular metabolism remains an important question. Here, we present 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structures of the cancer target isocitrate dehydrogenase (93 kDa) and identify the nature of conformational changes induced by binding of the allosteric small-molecule inhibitor ML309. We also report 2.8-Å- and 1.8-Å-resolution structures of lactate dehydrogenase (145 kDa) and glutamate dehydrogenase (334 kDa), respectively. With these results, two perceived barriers in single-particle cryo-EM are overcome: (1) crossing 2 Å resolution and (2) obtaining structures of proteins with sizes < 100 kDa, demonstrating that cryo-EM can be used to investigate a broad spectrum of drug-target interactions and dynamic conformational states."
https://openalex.org/W2402960573,"Regulated mechanisms of stem cell maintenance are key to preventing stem cell depletion and aging. While mitochondrial morphology plays a fundamental role in tissue development and homeostasis, its role in stem cells remains unknown. Here, we uncover that mitochondrial dynamics regulates stem cell identity, self-renewal, and fate decisions by orchestrating a transcriptional program. Manipulation of mitochondrial structure, through OPA1 or MFN1/2 deletion, impaired neural stem cell (NSC) self-renewal, with consequent age-dependent depletion, neurogenesis defects, and cognitive impairments. Gene expression profiling revealed ectopic expression of the Notch self-renewal inhibitor Botch and premature induction of transcription factors that promote differentiation. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics regulate stem cell fate decisions by driving a physiological reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated process, which triggers a dual program to suppress self-renewal and promote differentiation via NRF2-mediated retrograde signaling. These findings reveal mitochondrial dynamics as an upstream regulator of essential mechanisms governing stem cell self-renewal and fate decisions through transcriptional programming."
https://openalex.org/W2399947804,"Neural inputs from internal organs are essential for normal autonomic function. The vagus nerve is a key body-brain connection that monitors the digestive, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Within the gastrointestinal tract, vagal sensory neurons detect gut hormones and organ distension. Here, we investigate the molecular diversity of vagal sensory neurons and their roles in sensing gastrointestinal inputs. Genetic approaches allowed targeted investigation of gut-to-brain afferents involved in homeostatic responses to ingested nutrients (GPR65 neurons) and mechanical distension of the stomach and intestine (GLP1R neurons). Optogenetics, in vivo ganglion imaging, and genetically guided anatomical mapping provide direct links between neuron identity, peripheral anatomy, central anatomy, conduction velocity, response properties in vitro and in vivo, and physiological function. These studies clarify the roles of vagal afferents in mediating particular gut hormone responses. Moreover, genetic control over gut-to-brain neurons provides a molecular framework for understanding neural control of gastrointestinal physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2402763080,"A major challenge in understanding the cellular diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology. For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene NPAS4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states."

People wishing to lose weight use these devices to monitor energy balance, however the accuracy of these devices to measure such parameters has not been established.To determine the accuracy of four wrist-worn devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, Samsung Gear S and Mio Alpha) to measure heart rate and energy expenditure at rest and during exercise.Twenty-two healthy volunteers (50% female; aged 24 ± 5.6 years) completed ~1-hr protocols involving supine and seated rest, walking and running on a treadmill and cycling on an ergometer. Data from the devices collected during the protocol were compared with reference methods: electrocardiography (heart rate) and indirect calorimetry (energy expenditure).None of the devices performed significantly better overall, however heart rate was consistently more accurate than energy expenditure across all four devices. Correlations between the devices and reference methods were moderate to strong for heart rate (0.67-0.95 [0.35 to 0.98]) and weak to strong for energy expenditure (0.16-0.86 [-0.25 to 0.95]). All devices underestimated both outcomes compared to reference methods. The percentage error for heart rate was small across the devices (range: 1-9%) but greater for energy expenditure (9-43%). Similarly, limits of agreement were considerably narrower for heart rate (ranging from -27.3 to 13.1 bpm) than energy expenditure (ranging from -266.7 to 65.7 kcals) across devices.These devices accurately measure heart rate. However, estimates of energy expenditure are poor and would have implications for people using these devices for weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2401816914,"Projections from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), containing both GABAergic and glutamatergic components, encode conditioned responses and control compulsive reward-seeking behavior. GABAergic neurons in the LH have been shown to mediate appetitive and feeding-related behaviors. Here we show that the GABAergic component of the LH-VTA pathway supports positive reinforcement and place preference, while the glutamatergic component mediates place avoidance. In addition, our results indicate that photoactivation of these projections modulates other behaviors, such as social interaction and perseverant investigation of a novel object. We provide evidence that photostimulation of the GABAergic LH-VTA component, but not the glutamatergic component, increases dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) via inhibition of local VTA GABAergic neurons. Our study clarifies how GABAergic LH inputs to the VTA can contribute to generalized behavioral activation across multiple contexts, consistent with a role in increasing motivational salience.

https://openalex.org/W2396636851,"Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is associated with mutations in NPC1 and NPC2, whose gene products are key players in the endosomal/lysosomal egress of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol. NPC1 is also the intracellular receptor for Ebola virus (EBOV). Here, we present a 4.4 Å structure of full-length human NPC1 and a low-resolution reconstruction of NPC1 in complex with the cleaved glycoprotein (GPcl) of EBOV, both determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. NPC1 contains 13 transmembrane segments (TMs) and three distinct lumenal domains A (also designated NTD), C, and I. TMs 2–13 exhibit a typical resistance-nodulation-cell division fold, among which TMs 3–7 constitute the sterol-sensing domain conserved in several proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism and signaling. A trimeric EBOV-GPcl binds to one NPC1 monomer through the domain C. Our structural and biochemical characterizations provide an important framework for mechanistic understanding of NPC1-mediated intracellular cholesterol trafficking and Ebola virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2406024906,"Everyday function demands efficient and flexible decision-making that allows for habitual and goal-directed action control. An inability to shift has been implicated in disorders with impaired decision-making, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction. Despite this, our understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms and circuitry involved in shifting action control remains limited. Here we identify an endogenous molecular mechanism in a specific cortical-striatal pathway that mediates the transition between goal-directed and habitual action strategies. Deletion of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors from cortical projections originating in the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) prevents mice from shifting from goal-directed to habitual instrumental lever pressing. Activity of OFC neurons projecting to dorsal striatum (OFC-DS) and, specifically, activity of OFC-DS terminals is necessary for goal-directed action control. Lastly, CB1 deletion from OFC-DS neurons prevents the shift from goal-directed to habitual action control. These data suggest that the emergence of habits depends on endocannabinoid-mediated attenuation of a competing circuit controlling goal-directed behaviors."

The hematopoietic system is a complex hierarchical structure that produces several different types of specialized blood cells, most of which are short-lived and thereby require continuous replenishment with hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs).

Despite the well-established clinical use of HSPCs, their short- and long-term fate after transplantation and the clonal dynamics of hematopoietic reconstitution in humans remain poorly understood. Over the past few years, a series of phenotypic and functional characterization studies have identified various HSPC subpopulations within cells expressing the CD34 antigen, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are the most undifferentiated stem cell type, and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), which are downstream of the differentiation hierarchy but still capable of multilineage output (Doulatov et al., 2012Doulatov S.

Additionally, recent mouse studies marking HSPCs in vivo suggest that unperturbed hematopoiesis may be driven more substantially by MPPs rather than by HSCs (Sun et al., 2014Sun J. Ramos A.

Ideally, hematopoietic clonal dynamics should be studied by tracking the fate of individual clones in humans, revealing the rate and extent of hematopoietic recovery after transplant, and evaluating the possibility of long-term exhaustion due to in vitro cell manipulation. Such a study would have highly relevant implications for the broad clinical use of HSPCs and the long-term prognosis of treated patients. Ex vivo gene therapy (GT), based on the permanent gene correction of human HSPCs through the transfer of a therapeutic gene using retroviral (RV) or lentiviral (LV) vectors, has recently provided preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy for the treatment of various blood-borne genetic disorders (Aiuti et al., 2009Aiuti A.

Sequence reads belonging to each IS were used as surrogate markers of relative clonal size.Table 1Total Number of Unique Integration Sites and Relative Sequence Reads Retrieved from Four WAS Patients up to 48 Months after GTPatientNumber of ISsSequence ReadsPatient 127,4895,773,290Patient 225,5359,405,296Patient 324,7796,539,976Patient 411,7916,882,455Total89,59428,601,017 Open table in a new tab Table 2Cumulative Number of Unique Integration Sites Retrieved on the Infused Cell Product and at Different Time Points after GT from Different Cell Types Purified from the BM or PB of 4 WAS PatientsSamplesPatient 1Patient 2Patient 3Patient 4Pre-infusion1,228938619622BM CD341,2772,5422,3571,409BM CD141,2057782,9252,481BM CD153,2334,0564,1352,840BM CD192,3325,1585,0832,084BM CD33,6503,7075,9991,536BM CD561,2173,3353,8491,746BM CD611,1407351,7211,642BM GLYCO1,1941,8632,6331,337PB CD148,6915,8817,4022,764PB CD157,3917,0846,0072,314PB CD198,8048,55811,3513,358PB CD36,8745,8866,3232,908PB CD410,8397,4906,9932,798PB CD85,9754,0174,4092,256PB CD566,9537,9773,2032,194GLYCO, glycophorin+ cells. Open table in a new tab GLYCO, glycophorin+ cells. We first estimated the evolution of the clonal repertoire of gene-corrected cells over time by calculating the diversity index for each sample and time point on the basis of richness (number of unique ISs marking individual clones) and evenness (relative clonal contribution in terms of sequence reads associated to each IS). The diversity index of pre-infusion samples was consistent among patients, ranging between 5.6 and 6.2 (Figure 1A), and represented the highest average level of polyclonality observed, as expected from a heterogeneous population containing a large number of committed non-engrafting progenitors. After intravenous infusion in patients, we found that the diversity of the clonal repertoire of genetically engineered PB cells was lower in the early phases of hematopoietic reconstitution. It then stabilized in all patients after the first 6–9 months and remained steady until the last follow-up at 4 years after GT (diversity index ranging from 3.6 to 5.9; Figure 1A). In particular, when analyzing individual lineages, including BM samples, we observed fluctuation of the diversity index during the first 3 months after GT (Figures 1B and S1). Lymphoid cells displayed lower diversity in the early months after GT compared to myeloid lineages, in concordance with previously observed delayed lymphoid reconstitution (Aiuti et al., 2013Aiuti A. Biasco L. Scaramuzza S. Ferrua F. Cicalese M.P. Baricordi C. Dionisio F. Calabria A. Giannelli S. Castiello M.C. et al.Lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.Science. 2013; 341: 1233151Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Conversely, myeloid cells better mirror the early clonal dynamics of BM CD34+ progenitors when compared to B and T lymphocytes (Figure S1). Since the differences in diversity might be affected by an uneven collection of ISs over time, we compared diversity on randomized subsamples of identical amounts of ISs, confirming that in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, the highest diversity in vivo was observed at the last time points, irrespective of the IS sample size (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To evaluate whether clonal relationships among lineages and time points also changed over time, we calculated pairwise positive associations on the basis of the sharing of identical ISs between two cell types (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Using unsupervised clustering, we distinguished two major phases of hematopoietic reconstitution. The most stable sharing of identical ISs was observed over a period ranging from 3–6 to 48 months post-GT (Figure S2). This outcome was not influenced by potential background detection of IS contaminants associated with a low number of sequence reads, as these results were confirmed even after stringent data filtering to progressively remove poorly represented ISs from the datasets (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Although population size estimates have been performed in animal clonal tracking studies (Kim et al., 2014Kim S. Kim N. Presson A.P. Metzger M.E. Bonifacino A.C. Sehl M. Chow S.A. Crooks G.M. Dunbar C.E. An D.S. et al.Dynamics of HSPC repopulation in nonhuman primates revealed by a decade-long clonal-tracking study.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 14: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), there is currently no information available on the number of clones that make up different cell compartments derived from transplanted HSPCs in humans in steady-state hematopoiesis. In order to comprehensively address this point, we first calculated the probability of recapturing identical ISs within the same lineages over time. We observed a general increase in the probability of recapturing identical clones over time, which reached a stable level at ∼12 months after GT (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). On the basis of these results, we then estimated, using Markov processes enclosed on an open population estimator, the number of clones making up different PB lineages isolated after 12 months (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figure 1C, the estimated population size of differentiated PB gene-corrected clones was constant over a period of 2–3 years in all patients, ranging between 1,600 and 4,300 clones. The estimated total number of clones differed between lineages and was greater in the lymphoid compartment than in the myeloid one (Figure 1D). This result is consistent with the longer survival potential of lymphoid cells and with the early effects of selective advantage for gene-corrected lymphocytes expressing WAS protein (Aiuti et al., 2013Aiuti A. Biasco L. Scaramuzza S. Ferrua F. Cicalese M.P. Baricordi C. Dionisio F. Calabria A. Giannelli S.

Ther. 2012; 21: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Within the BM CD34+ cell population, the number of clones was higher in the early post-GT phase and decreased over the following months to a smaller steady-state population composed of ∼1,200 clones (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). In order to study the clonal output of transduced progenitors to differentiated lineages, we evaluated the level of IS sharing between BM CD34+ and myeloid or lymphoid cells over time. As shown in Figure 2A, the percentage of ISs shared between CD34+ cells and myeloid or lymphoid lineages was much lower in early versus late time points, the lowest being at 3 months after GT. The nature of the output measured at later time points was predominantly bi-potent (myeloid and lymphoid), reflecting the activity of multipotent progenitors. Although we applied stringent filters before performing this analysis to account for potential cross-contamination, a similar trend was observed even when analyzing the entire dataset (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). This suggests that the observed increase in shared integrations reflects an underlying biological phenomenon and is not simply due to technical artifacts of potential contamination among purified subpopulations, which would not be expected to change owing to the time of collection. We then expanded the analysis of CD34+ cell output to all lineages isolated from the BM and PB of WAS patients over time. The “rainbow” area of the plots in Figure 2B shows the IS percentage shared between BM CD34+ cells and each of the purified cell subtypes. During the first 3 months, we observed a shrinkage in output toward all lineages analyzed for each patient. Starting at 6 months, the level of IS sharing increased, and progenitor output was highly distributed to all lineages. This substantial multipotent output was consistently maintained up to 3 years after GT. To formally validate IS sharing as being representative of progenitor activity, we isolated ISs from colony-forming cells (CFCs) generated in vitro from the same CD34+ cells analyzed above at the last follow-up when patient hematopoiesis was steady state. These represented highly purified samples, in which at the end of clonogenic assay, contamination with mature cells from the original harvest was virtually absent. The average vector copy number (VCN) of vector-positive CFCs, at the latest follow-up available, ranged from 1.2 to 1.7. As shown in Table S1, we observed a substantial percentage of IS retrieved from CFCs in each patient analyzed, identical to those detected in myeloid and/or lymphoid cells isolated in vivo at the same time point. To gain additional information on HSPC activity, we then studied the datasets from the opposite perspective, evaluating the input level that each lineage received from CD34+ cells at different time points. Figure 2C shows on a heatmap the proportion of ISs within each lineage and time point shared with CD34+ progenitors over time. In line with the data reported above, the greatest IS similarities between different cell types and BM CD34+ cells were observed at the last follow-up after GT. Unsupervised clustering for lineages and sources showed that PB lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and megakaryocte-erythroid progenitors clustered separately from each other on the basis of their relationships with BM CD34+ precursors. CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells isolated from BM or PB were found to be co-clustered with myeloid cells purified from PB and not with lymphoid T cells that were rather grouped independently. Previous studies using xenotransplantation assays have identified the human Lin−/CD34+/CD38−/CD90+/CD45RA− fraction as being endowed with long-term repopulation potential (Doulatov et al., 2012Doulatov S.

https://openalex.org/W2402294100,"The life span of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is short (3-5 days), and its regulation is thought to be important for homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium. We have now investigated the role of commensal bacteria in regulation of IEC turnover in the small intestine. The proliferative activity of IECs in intestinal crypts as well as the migration of these cells along the crypt-villus axis were markedly attenuated both in germ-free mice and in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice treated with a mixture of antibiotics, with antibiotics selective for Gram-positive bacteria being most effective in this regard. Oral administration of chloroform-treated feces of SPF mice to germ-free mice resulted in a marked increase in IEC turnover, suggesting that spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria contribute to this effect. Oral administration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as bacterial fermentation products also restored the turnover of IECs in antibiotic-treated SPF mice as well as promoted the development of intestinal organoids in vitro. Antibiotic treatment reduced the phosphorylation levels of ERK, ribosomal protein S6, and STAT3 in IECs of SPF mice. Our results thus suggest that Gram-positive commensal bacteria are a major determinant of IEC turnover, and that their stimulatory effect is mediated by SCFAs."
https://openalex.org/W2402883299,"The plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 gene (PVT1) is an lncRNA that has been designated as an oncogene due to its contribution to the phenotype of multiple cancers. Although the mechanism by which PVT1 influences disease processes has been studied in multiple cancer types, its role in cervical tumorigenesis remains unknown. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate the role of PVT1 in cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. PVT1 expression was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 121 invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC) samples, 30 normal cervix samples, and cervical cell lines. Functional assays were carried out using both siRNA and LNA-mediated knockdown to examine PVT1’s effects on cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, apoptosis, and cisplatin resistance. Our results demonstrate that PVT1 expression is significantly increased in ICC tissue versus normal cervix and that higher expression of PVT1 correlates with poorer overall survival. In cervical cancer cell lines, PVT1 knockdown resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while apoptosis and cisplatin cytotoxicity were significantly increased in these cells. Finally, we show that PVT1 expression is augmented in response to hypoxia and immune response stimulation and that this lncRNA associates with the multifunctional and stress-responsive protein, Nucleolin. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for an oncogenic role of PVT1 in cervical cancer and lend insight into potential mechanisms by which PVT1 overexpression helps drive cervical carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2397049672,"Defects in circadian rhythm influence physiology and behavior with implications for the treatment of sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and cancer. Although core regulatory components of clock rhythmicity have been defined, insight into the mechanisms underpinning amplitude is limited. Here, we show that REV-ERBα, a core inhibitory component of clock transcription, is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7. By relieving REV-ERBα-dependent repression, FBXW7 provides an unrecognized mechanism for enhancing the amplitude of clock gene transcription. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-mediated phosphorylation of REV-ERBα is necessary for FBXW7 recognition. Moreover, targeted hepatic disruption of FBXW7 alters circadian expression of core clock genes and perturbs whole-body lipid and glucose levels. This CDK1-FBXW7 pathway controlling REV-ERBα repression defines an unexpected molecular mechanism for re-engaging the positive transcriptional arm of the clock, as well as a potential route to manipulate clock amplitude via small molecule CDK1 inhibition."

The MS4As therefore define a distinct mechanism and functional logic for mammalian olfaction. As animals navigate the natural world, they encounter an unending variety of small molecules, which are rich sources of information that signify the presence of organisms and salient objects in the environment. The olfactory system detects many of these molecules through odorant receptor proteins expressed by peripheral olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which are coupled to higher brain circuits mediating odor perception (Axel, 1995Axel R. The molecular logic of smell.Sci. Am. 1995; 273: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Ihara et al., 2013Ihara S. Yoshikawa K. Touhara K. Chemosensory signals and their receptors in the olfactory neural system.Neuroscience. 2013; 254: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In mammals, the olfactory system is divided into multiple, parallel processing streams made up of anatomically and molecularly distinct sensory neuron populations. The largest subdivision, the main olfactory system, is capable of detecting nearly all volatile odorants and plays key roles in odor discrimination and learning. Smaller subsystems (such as the vomeronasal system) are thought to play a more specialized role in odor perception, discriminating odors of innate significance and releasing specific patterns of reproductive, agonistic, or defensive behavior (Munger et al., 2009Munger S.D. Leinders-Zufall T. Zufall F. Subsystem organization of the mammalian sense of smell.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2009; 71: 115-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The main and vomeronasal olfactory systems each express characteristic odorant receptor families that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily; these receptor families define the specific receptive fields and therefore the function of each subsystem (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

The identification of these receptor genes (including the odorant receptors [ORs], vomeronasal type 1 receptors, vomeronasal type 2 receptors [V2Rs], formyl peptide receptors, and the trace amine-associated receptors) has revealed a key organizational principle: each mature olfactory sensory neuron (with the exception of those within the basal subdivision of the vomeronasal system) expresses just a single receptor gene of the hundreds encoded in the genome (Dalton and Lomvardas, 2015Dalton R.P. Lomvardas S. Chemosensory receptor specificity and regulation.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This pattern of expression defines specific information channels in the olfactory system, as the axons of those sensory neurons that express the same odorant receptor converge on a small number of insular structures within the olfactory bulb called glomeruli; these glomeruli are differentially recruited as animals sense distinct smells, enabling the brain to discriminate odors detected by the nose (Mori and Sakano, 2011Mori K. Sakano H. How is the olfactory map formed and interpreted in the mammalian brain?.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 467-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Individual basal vomeronasal sensory neurons also target specific bulb glomeruli but express two V2Rs instead of a single receptor (Martini et al., 2001Martini S. Silvotti L. Shirazi A. Ryba N.J. Tirindelli R. Co-expression of putative pheromone receptors in the sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 843-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the identification of odorant receptor genes has led to deep insight into the sensory tuning and functional architecture of the main and vomeronasal subsystems, there are additional mammalian subsystems whose modes of odor detection—and therefore function—are less clear. Particularly mysterious is the “necklace” subsystem, which is distinguished by its unusual anatomy: OSNs within this subsystem are concentrated in the recesses of the olfactory epithelium (the “cul-de-sac” regions), and project axons to a ring of 12–40 apparently interconnected glomeruli that encircle the caudal olfactory bulb like beads on a necklace (Juilfs et al., 1997Juilfs D.M.

While many of these ligands have innate significance for the mouse, the specific role of the necklace in olfactory perception remains unclear. Intriguingly, necklace OSNs do not express the signaling proteins known to mediate GPCR-based chemotransduction in the rest of the main olfactory epithelium (Juilfs et al., 1997Juilfs D.M. Fülle H.J.

While the ability of the necklace system to detect and behaviorally respond to gases and peptides requires the single-pass transmembrane protein guanylate cyclase-D (GC-D), which is specifically expressed in all necklace neurons, the remainder of the diverse sensory responses observed in this system are unexplained (Guo et al., 2009Guo D.

These observations suggest that necklace OSNs harbor an as-yet unrecognized receptor type, whose identification could reveal key features of the functional organization and neural logic that governs the necklace system. Here, we show that necklace OSNs express a previously unidentified class of chemoreceptor encoded by the Ms4a gene family. Each MS4A protein detects a specific set of odors—including ethologically relevant odorants like fatty acids and the putative mouse pheromone 2,5-DMP—that stimulate necklace sensory neurons in vivo. Ectopic expression of MS4A proteins is sufficient to confer responses to MS4A ligands upon conventional olfactory neurons. However, unlike all known mammalian olfactory receptors, the Ms4a genes do not belong to the GPCR superfamily and are not expressed in the conventional one-receptor-one-neuron pattern; instead, each Ms4a gene encodes a four-pass transmembrane protein, and many Ms4a family members are expressed in every necklace sensory neuron. Taken together, this work defines a new mechanism for mammalian olfaction and identifies a population of atypical olfactory sensory neurons that each express many members of a receptor gene family, suggesting a distinct perceptual role for odor information coursing through the necklace subsystem. Because MS4A proteins are also expressed in chemosensory cells that reside outside of the nasal epithelium, these findings further suggest a broader role for the MS4A proteins in the detection of chemical cues. To identify candidate receptor gene families specific to the necklace olfactory system, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to compare transcripts expressed by FACS-isolated GC-D-expressing and conventional OSNs (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S1B). This analysis failed to reveal expression of known odorant receptor families or enrichment of other GPCR subfamilies within necklace sensory neurons. Consistent with this and prior reports, Golf, Adcy3, Cnga2, Cnga4, Trpc2, and Trpm5—gene products required for odor-related signal transduction in conventional OSNs—also were not expressed in GC-D cells (Munger et al., 2009Munger S.D.

To screen for potential non-GPCR odorant receptors, the RNA-seq data were filtered to identify transmembrane protein families that exhibit sufficient molecular diversity to potentially interact with a wide range of ligands. As detailed below, this screen identified the membrane-spanning, 4-pass A (Ms4a) genes, which encode a class of four-transmembrane (4TM)-spanning proteins that are structurally distinct from GPCRs (Eon Kuek et al., 2015Eon Kuek L.

RNA-seq revealed transcripts for several Ms4a family members in GC-D-expressing cells (Figure 1B). Because Ms4a transcripts had low RNA-seq read counts, the Nanostring single-molecule detection technique was used to unambiguously determine the presence of every member of the Ms4a gene family in GC-D cells (Khan et al., 2011Khan M. Vaes E. Mombaerts P. Regulation of the probability of mouse odorant receptor gene choice.Cell. 2011; 147: 907-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed the reproducible expression of 12 Ms4a family members (of the 17 members annotated in the mouse genome), demonstrating that GC-D cells express low levels of a specific subset of Ms4a genes (Figure 1C). None of these 12 genes was detected in conventional OSNs above background (data not shown). Notably absent from GC-D cells are the two best-studied Ms4a genes, Ms4a1 and Ms4a2, which have been implicated in calcium signaling downstream of the B cell receptor and high-affinity Fc-Epsilon receptor, respectively but whose precise function remains unclear (Bubien et al., 1993Bubien J.K.

To assess the molecular diversity of the MS4A family, Ms4a genes were identified from representative species of all major mammalian lineages. We then asked how different these genes were within a given species, as amino acid differences are a prerequisite for individual MS4As to interact with distinct odors. Multiple sequence alignments revealed substantial intraspecies diversity among the MS4As, particularly within the extracellular domains of the protein, whose length is variable (Figures S2A and S2B). This diversity is comparable to that observed in the third through seventh transmembrane domains in conventional ORs, the regions thought to form ligand-binding pockets that give rise to odorant specificity (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L.

Analysis of the molecular basis for octanal interactions in the expressed rat 17 olfactory receptor.Chem. Senses. 2000; 25: 155-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that each MS4A within a given organism may interact with a distinct set of extracellular cues. Ms4a genes are found in a single genomic cluster in all queried mammals; this organization, suggestive of tandem duplication, is also found in known chemoreceptor gene families and is thought to facilitate diversification of family members (Figure 2A) (Nei et al., 2008Nei M. Niimura Y. Nozawa M. The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 951-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We therefore also assessed differences between Ms4a genes across species to identify those regions of the MS4A protein subject to diversifying or purifying selection. MS4A proteins were significantly divergent across evolution (Figure S2C) (Nei et al., 2008Nei M. Niimura Y. Nozawa M. The evolution of animal chemosensory receptor gene repertoires: roles of chance and necessity.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 951-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar); the most rapidly evolving amino acid residues in the MS4A proteins are highly enriched in the predicted extracellular loops, where contact with environmental chemical stimuli could occur (Figure 2B). Bitter taste receptors, which accommodate the specific diet of their host organism, exhibit a similar pattern of diversifying selection (Figure 2B) (Hayakawa et al., 2014Hayakawa T. Suzuki-Hashido N. Matsui A. Go Y. Frequent expansions of the bitter taste receptor gene repertoire during evolution of mammals in the Euarchontoglires clade.Mol. Biol.

Evol. 2011; 73: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast, members of the Orai family, which encode 4TM proteins and are not thought to detect environmental chemical stimuli, show no signs of diversifying selection (Figure 2B) (Amcheslavsky et al., 2015Amcheslavsky A. Wood M.L. Yeromin A.V. Parker I. Freites J.A. Tobias D.J. Cahalan M.D. Molecular biophysics of Orai store-operated Ca2+ channels.Biophys. J. 2015; 108: 237-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The MS4A family therefore exhibits a pattern of expansion and divergence similar to other chemosensors, although the observation that both within- and between-species MS4A sequence variability is enriched within extracellular loops—rather than traditional hydrophobic binding pockets—suggests that, if the MS4As detect odors, they do so through a distinct domain from conventional GPCR ORs. Although no endogenous or natural ligands have been identified for any member of the MS4A family, the specific expression of a molecularly diverse complement of MS4As within olfactory sensory neurons—taken with prior evidence suggesting involvement in calcium signaling—raised the possibility that Ms4a genes encode a novel class of chemoreceptor (Bubien et al., 1993Bubien J.K.

To test whether specific interactions between odors and MS4A proteins induce calcium influx in cells, we heterologously expressed individual MS4A proteins together with the genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6s in HEK293 cells (Figures S3A and S3B); expression of MS4A proteins did not increase the baseline rate of calcium transients (Figures S3C and S3D). Six MS4A proteins (selected for their structural diversity) were exposed to 11 compound mixtures, each of whose constituents shared similar chemical structure. These mixes were designed to cover a broad swath of odor space and included known ligands for conventional and necklace glomeruli (Gao et al., 2010Gao L. Hu J. Zhong C. Luo M.

https://openalex.org/W2397979991,"A surprisingly large number of neurons throughout the brain are endowed with the ability to co-release both a fast excitatory and inhibitory transmitter. The computational benefits of dual transmitter release, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we address the role of co-transmission of acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA from starburst amacrine cells (SACs) to direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Using a combination of pharmacology, optogenetics, and linear regression methods, we estimated the spatiotemporal profiles of GABA, ACh, and glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic activity in DSGCs evoked by motion. We found that ACh initiates responses to motion in natural scenes or under low-contrast conditions. In contrast, classical glutamatergic pathways play a secondary role, amplifying cholinergic responses via NMDA receptor activation. Furthermore, under these conditions, the network of SACs differentially transmits ACh and GABA to DSGCs in a directional manner. Thus, mixed transmission plays a central role in shaping directional responses of DSGCs."
https://openalex.org/W2407016306,"The factors driving the composition of gut microbiota are still only partly understood but appear to include environmental, cultural, and genetic factors. In order to obtain more insight into the relative importance of these factors, we analyzed the microbiome composition in subjects of Tibetan or Han descent living at different altitudes. DNA was isolated from stool samples. Using polymerase chain reaction methodology, the 16S rRNA V1–V3 regions were amplified and the sequence information was analyzed by principal coordinates analysis and Lefse analyses. Contrasting the Tibetan and Han populations both living at the 3600 m altitude, we found that the Tibetan microbiome is characterized by a relative abundance of Prevotella whereas the Han stool was enriched in Bacteroides. Comparing the microbiome of Han stool obtained from populations living at different altitudes revealed a more energy efficient flora in samples from those living at higher altitude relative to their lower-altitude counterparts. Comparison of the stool microbiome of Tibetan herders living at 4800 m to rural Tibetans living at 3600 m altitude shows that the former have a flora enriched in butyrate-producing bacteria, possibly in response to the harsher environment that these herders face. Thus, the study shows that both altitude and genetic/cultural background have a significant influence on microbiome composition, and it represents the first attempt to compare stool microbiota of Tibetan and Han populations in relation to altitude."

AtRGS1 is a negative regulator, having a GPCR-like N-terminal seven-transmembrane domain fused to a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) protein, which keeps the G protein complex in the inactive state (4.Chen J.-G.

This is in contrast to animals, where nucleotide exchange is the rate-limiting step catalyzed by its cognate GPCR. In animals, continued agonist occupancy of the GPCR leads to phosphorylation at its cytoplasmic C-terminal domain, leading to desensitization through GPCR endocytosis, whereas in Arabidopsis, agonist-induced endocytosis of AtRGS1 leads to sustained activation. Phosphorylation of GPCRs and AtRGS1 is necessary and sufficient for their endocytosis (5.Urano D. Chen J.-G. Botella J.R. Jones A.M.

We hypothesized that specific LRR RLKs directly modulate G signaling through phosphorylation of AtRGS1 to induce its endocytosis and thus consequently release its inhibition on G protein self-activation. In this study, we screened 70 LRR RLKs to determine whether AtRGS1 serves as an LRR RLK substrate.

The G protein complex and several plant LRR RLKs cooperatively control plant development, cell death, and responses to biotic and abiotic stress; however, the molecular mechanism of the cooperation remains poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that LRR RLKs directly activate G protein by phosphorylating its negative regulator AtRGS1, we screened 70 active, recombinant arginine-aspartate-type LRR RLKs (22.Mitra S.K. Chen R. Dhandaydham M. Wang X. Blackburn R.K. Kota U. Goshe M.B. Schwartz D. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D.

The levels of trans- and autophosphorylation were quantitated (data not shown) and found not to correlate, statistically supported by a correlation coefficient R2 = 0.01. For example in Fig. 1A, reaction #29 (At4G20140) showed autophosphorylation but poor AtRGS1 transphosphorylation. At the other extreme, reaction #52 (At2G28970) transphosphorylated AtRGS1 but autophosphorylated weakly. Moreover, because the majority of kinases, each purified under the same conditions, did not phosphorylate AtRGS1, a contaminating kinase from Escherichia coli is excluded as the source of phosphorylation. Other negative controls were reactions with no kinase (NC, Fig. 1A) and a kinase-dead LRR RLK At1g29440 (reaction #70, Fig. 1A). Among the tested LRR RLKs that phosphorylated AtRGS1 in vitro, several are involved in pathogen defense such as BAK1-like 1 (BKK1) (25.He K. Gou X. Yuan T. Lin H. Asami T. Yoshida S. Russell S.D.

BAK1 and FLS2 were not in the original set of screened LRR RLKs; therefore they are included in a second test of the transphosphorylation of AtRGS1, following reaction optimization. Transphosphorylation of AtRGS1 by BKK1 and IOS1 was confirmed by the second screen; BAK1 strongly phosphorylated AtRGS1; and neither BIR1 nor FLS2 phosphorylated AtRGS1 under this test condition (Fig. 1C). Note that we observed no autophosphorylation of FLS2 in contrast to Gómez-Gómez et al. (37.Gómez-Gómez L. Bauer Z. Boller T. Both the extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and the kinase activity of FSL2 are required for flagellin binding and signaling in Arabidopsis.Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant RGS box + Ct (Fig. 1D) phosphorylated by BAK1 identified one phosphorylation site, Ser428 (Fig. 1, E and F) in the entire AtRGS1 C-terminal domain. Sequence coverage identified by mass spectrometry was excellent, and the three fragments not identified lacked Ser and Thr (Fig. 1E). The identified phosphorylated tryptic peptide is shown in Fig. 1F. Because the stoichiometry under the tested conditions was 0.5 mol of phosphate/mol of AtRGS1 C-terminal domain (data not shown), Ser428 is likely the sole amino acid in the AtRGS1 C-terminal domain phosphorylated by BAK1. BAK1 is a partner to the flg22 receptor FLS2. Therefore, we tested the effect of flg22 on AtRGS1 phosphorylation in vivo using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser428 and two other known phosphorylation sites, Ser435 and Ser436 (8.Urano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1G, flg22 increased by 2-fold the pool of phosphorylated native AtRGS1 (the bottom band to the right of the arrow is the native AtRGS1 having ∼50 kDa of molecular mass) and YFP-tagged AtRGS1 (the upper band shows ∼70 kDa of YFP-tagged AtRGS1) within a 5-min exposure to 100 nm flg22 in stably transformed Arabidopsis wild type expressing YFP-tagged AtRGS1. As will be elaborated later, a 2-fold increase in the phosphorylated pool is consistent with a cellular change in AtRGS1. The flg22 effect requires its receptor FLS2 because the fls2 null mutant lacked phosphorylated AtRGS1 (Fig. 1G). Because seven-transmembrane proteins are notoriously difficult to extract, we used two different detergents, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM) and ASB-14, that are effective in AtRGS1 solubilization (38.Li B. Makino S.-I. Beebe E.T. Urano D. Aceti D.J. Misenheimer T.M. Peters J. Fox B.G. Jones A.M. Cell-free translation and purification of Arabidopsis thaliana regulator of G protein signaling 1.Protein Expr. Purif. 2016; 126: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). ASB-14-solubilized AtRGS1 is shown in Fig. 1G, but similar results for DDM-solubilized AtRGS1 were also observed (data not shown). Among the many LRR RLK candidates that emerged from our screen, we chose the flg22/FLS2 pathway to test LRR RLK activation of G signaling. Ideally, to quantitate direct G protein activation, one would quantitate changes in intermolecular FRET efficiency between donor and acceptor fluorophores within the heterotrimeric G protein complex, but this is not possible (39.Adjobo-Hermans M.J.W. Goedhart J. Gadella Jr., T.W. Plant G protein heterotrimers require dual lipidation motifs of Gα and Gγ and do not dissociate upon activation.J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 5087-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 3M. Tunc-Ozdemir and A. M. Jones, unpublished data. Therefore, in lieu of a Gα-Gβγ FRET reporter, there are two standardized reporters for plant G protein activation: 1) FRET efficiency change between AtRGS1-YFP and AtGPA1-CFP reports maximum glucose-induced activation at 4 min and its return to the starting level within 8 more min (40.Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.-G. Siderovski D.P. Jones A.M. Willard F.S. GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17317-17322Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and 2) endocytosis of AtRGS1 reports sustained G protein activation in the 10–30-min time range (7.Fu Y. Lim S. Urano D. Tunc-Ozdemir M. Phan N.G. Elston T.C. Jones A.M. Reciprocal encoding of signal intensity and duration in a glucose-sensing circuit.Cell. 2014; 156: 1084-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that flg22/FLS2/BAK1 directly activates G protein-coupled signaling in plants, we first measured the FRET efficiency changes between AtRGS1-YFP and AtGPA1-CFP in response to flg22. A low concentration of flg22 (100 nm) as well as a higher one (1 μm) decreased FRET efficiency between AtRGS1-YFP and AtGPA1-CFP to zero within 5 min (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05), indicating a large proximity change between these two proteins. By 10 min after flg22 addition, FRET efficiency returned toward the starting level. The strength and timing were the same observed as for glucose-induced changes in FRET efficiency (40.Johnston C.A. Taylor J.P. Gao Y. Kimple A.J. Grigston J.C. Chen J.-G. Siderovski D.P. Jones A.M. Willard F.S. GTPase acceleration as the rate-limiting step in Arabidopsis G protein-coupled sugar signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17317-17322Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). When the cells were treated with the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A prior to flg22 treatment, the return to baseline was delayed, indicating that the phosphorylation state of AtRGS1 is associated with the flg22-induced conformational change (Fig. 2A). Because phosphorylation of AtRGS1 at the C-terminal Ser428 is necessary for endocytosis by WNK8 kinase in response to d-glucose (8.Urano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that AtRGS1 phosphorylation by LRR RLKs at Ser428 results in endocytosis in response to its cognate ligand, leading to physical uncoupling of Gα protein from AtRGS1 and, consequently, activation of G signaling. To test this hypothesis, we quantitated G protein activation induced by flg22 by analyzing the percentage of AtRGS1 endocytosis over time in Arabidopsis hypocotyls (Fig. 2B). flg22 (1 μm) internalized ∼55% of AtRGS1 within 3 min (p < 0.01). The flg22 effect is structurally specific because mutation of the flg22 peptide (ΔFLG22 flg15-Δ7; sequence RINSAKDD (41.Chinchilla D. Bauer Z. Regenass M. Boller T. Felix G. The Arabidopsis receptor kinase FLS2 binds flg22 and determines the specificity of flagellin perception.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar)) failed to induce AtRGS1-YFP internalization at the same concentration (Fig. 2B, inset). The observed changes in the percentage of internalized AtRGS1 over time are consistent with the flg22-induced change in the AtRGS1 phosphorylation state. Specifically, given the fact that the stoichiometry of phosphate to AtRGS1 determined in vitro is ∼1 and given that flg22 induces an ∼2-fold increment in AtRGS1 internalization, the observed 2-fold difference in flg22-induced phosphorylated AtRGS1 meets expectation (Fig. 1F). When the C-terminal domain containing the phosphorylation motifs was truncated (Fig. 2C) or when Ser428 on AtRGS1 was mutated (Fig. 2D), the 1 μm flg22 did not induce internalization of AtRGS1-YFP. flg22-induced endocytosis of AtRGS1-YFP was also impaired in the fls2 (Fig. 2B) and bak1-4 (Fig. 2E) mutants treated with 1 μm flg22, indicating that FLS2/BAK1 are the co-receptors for flg22 activation of G signaling. To confirm that AtRGS1 endocytosis was still feasible in the fls2 or bak1-4 mutants, glucose was tested, and we found that the previously reported internalization (8.Urano D. Phan N. Jones J.C. Yang J. Huang J. Grigston J. Taylor J.P. Jones A.M. Endocytosis of the seven-transmembrane RGS1 protein activates G-protein-coupled signalling in Arabidopsis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) occurred at 30 min in both bak1-4 (Fig. 2E) and fls2 mutants (data not shown). The lack of a flg22-increased phosphorylation of AtRGS1 in bak1-4 mutants as seen in the wild type (Fig. 2F) indicates that BAK1 is required for flg22-dependent G signaling activation. Discrimination of signals achieved via GPCRs in animal heterotrimeric G signaling pathways is well understood (42.Lee S.-M. Booe J.M. Pioszak A.A.

Chung K.Y. Structural mechanism of G protein activation by G protein-coupled receptor.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2015; 763: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, for plants that lack GPCRs, such clarity was missing despite the evidence to date indicating that many different signals are coupled by the plant G protein complex to cellular responses (2.Urano D.

Jones A.M. “Round up the usual suspects”: a comment on nonexistent plant GPCRs.Plant Physiol. 2013; 161: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that signal specificity achieved in plant cells generally occurs directly through AtRGS1 phosphorylation by LRR RLKs. There are three possible mechanisms for how the phosphorylation of the AtRGS1 domain alters the function of the system, and we confirmed one. 1) Phosphorylation of AtRGS1 alters the global conformation to its Gα substrate and by doing so is no longer able to accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity, and thus Gα self-activates. We showed that this conformational change occurs (Fig. 2A). 2) flg22 directly inhibits AtRGS1 catalytic GAP activity, although this mechanism is unlikely because flg22 acts extracellularly yet the RGS catalytic domain is cytoplasmic. Nonetheless, this mechanism remains a possibility as we have not yet tested the GAP activity of a phosphorylated AtRGS1. 3) The adaptor requires AtRGS1 to be phosphorylated before it can interact with it to commence endocytosis, similar to GPCR endocytosis requiring their cognate adaptors, β-arrestins. To test this hypothesis, we need to know the adaptor. There are no β-arrestins in plant cells, but there are candidate arrestin-fold proteins (45.Oliviusson P. Heinzerling O. Hillmer S. Hinz G. Tse Y.C. Jiang L. Robinson D.G. Plant retromer, localized to the prevacuolar compartment and microvesicles in Arabidopsis, may interact with vacuolar sorting receptors.Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1239-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to be tested in follow-on studies. We do not exclude the possibility that the role of AtRGS1 phosphorylation in the G protein activation mechanism is also required for adaptor recognition. Given that all the LRR RLKs that are known to operate in innate immunity either phosphorylate AtRGS1 in vitro or genetically interact with BAK1, we speculate that BAK1/co-receptor itself provides the discrimination of signal to G proteins. A study of two BAK1 mutants suggested that varied phosphorylation patterns of RLK partners (BRI1, FLS2, EFR, and BIK1) by BAK1 is the basis for selective regulation of signaling pathways (46.Wang Y. Li Z. Liu D. Xu J. Wei X. Yan L. Yang C. Lou Z. Shui W. Assessment of BAK1 activity in different plant receptor-like kinase complexes by quantitative profiling of phosphorylation patterns.J. Proteomics. 2014; 108: 484-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 47.Wang X. Kota U. He K. Blackburn K. Li J. Goshe M.B. Huber S.C. Clouse S.D. Sequential transphosphorylation of the BRI1/BAK1 receptor kinase complex impacts early events in brassinosteroid signaling.Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 220-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that phosphorylation of different AtRGS1 residues by BAK1 in response to different signals may drive diverse functions of heterotrimeric G proteins in plant development, defense, cell death, and biotic stress response pathways. At present, our data do not distinguish between AtRGS1 internalization 1) being the starting point for a signal downstream on the endosomes by itself or along with FLS2, 2) being part of the desensitization of LRR RLK activation, or 3) being solely important for G protein activation as it is an inhibitor of the complex on the membrane. If it is the former, AtRGS1 endocytosis with the different receptors in different signaling pathways could explain the signal specificity achieved downstream of the activation complexes formed by AtRGS1. In addition, BAK1 or the other LRR RLKs might phosphorylate AtRGS1 at different sites, and this might change the specificity of downstream signaling or in which complex"
https://openalex.org/W2398293253,"Chromatin remodeling enzymes act to dynamically regulate gene accessibility. In many cases, these enzymes function as large multicomponent complexes that in general comprise a central ATP-dependent Snf2 family helicase that is decorated with a variable number of regulatory subunits. The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which is essential for normal development in higher organisms, is one such macromolecular machine. The NuRD complex comprises ∼10 subunits, including the histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and HDAC2), and is defined by the presence of a CHD family remodeling enzyme, most commonly CHD4 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4). The existing paradigm holds that CHD4 acts as the central hub upon which the complex is built. We show here that this paradigm does not, in fact, hold and that CHD4 is a peripheral component of the NuRD complex. A complex lacking CHD4 that has HDAC activity can exist as a stable species. The addition of recombinant CHD4 to this nucleosome deacetylase complex reconstitutes a NuRD complex with nucleosome remodeling activity. These data contribute to our understanding of the architecture of the NuRD complex."

Hypotheses implicating hypothalamic-pituitary -adrenal, -gonadal, and -thyroid axes, immune response, genetic factors, and neurotransmitters have emerged to explain this difference. However, more evidence for these hypotheses is needed and new explanations must be explored. Here, we investigated sex differences in MDD markers using multiplex immunoassay measurements of 171 serum molecules in individuals enrolled in the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NMDD = 231; Ncontrol = 365). We found 28 sex-dependent markers of MDD, as quantified by a significant interaction between sex and log2-transformed analyte concentration in a logistic regression with diagnosis (MDD/control) as the outcome variable (p<0.05; q<0.30). Among these were a number of male-specific associations between MDD and elevated levels of proteins involved in immune response, including C-reactive protein, trefoil factor 3, cystatin-C, fetuin-A, β2-microglobulin, CD5L, FASLG receptor, and tumor necrosis factor receptor 2. Furthermore, only male MDD could be classified with an accuracy greater than chance using the measured serum analytes (area under the ROC curve = 0.63). These findings may have consequences for the generalization of inflammatory hypotheses of depression to males and females and have important implications for the development of diagnostic biomarker tests for MDD. More studies are needed to validate these results, investigate a broader range of biological pathways, and integrate this data with brain imaging, genetic, and other relevant data."
https://openalex.org/W2397167025,"Socially disadvantaged people have an increased need for medical care due to a higher burden of health problems and chronic diseases. In Germany, outpatient care is chiefly provided by office-based general practitioners and specialists in private practice. People are free to choose the physician they prefer. In this study, national data were used to examine differences in the use of outpatient medical care by socioeconomic status (SES).The analyses were based on data from 6,754 participants in the Robert Koch Institute's German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (DEGS1) aged between 18 and 69 years. The number of outpatient physician visits during the past twelve months was assessed for several medical specializations. SES was determined based on education, occupation, and income. Associations between SES and physician visits were analysed using logistic regression and zero-truncated negative binomial regression for count data.After adjusting for sociodemographic factors and health indicators, outpatients with low SES had more contacts with general practitioners than outpatients with high SES (men: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08-1.46; women: IRR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.07-1.34). The use of specialists was lower in people with low SES than in those with high SES when sociodemographic factors and health indicators were adjusted for (men: odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.51-0.91; women: OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.41-0.77). This applied particularly to specialists in internal medicine, dermatology, and gynaecology. The associations remained after additional adjustment for the type of health insurance and the regional density of office-based physicians.The findings suggest that socially disadvantaged people are seen by general practitioners more often than the socially better-off, who are more likely to visit a medical specialist. These differences may be due to differences in patient preferences, physician factors, physician-patient interaction, and potential barriers to accessing specialist care."

Wild-type (WT) yeast normally restrict most of the phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to the inner cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane.

This loss of asymmetry occurs despite the presence of other flippases that flip PS and/or PE. Even when overexpressed, Drs2 and Dnf1 were unable to correct the loss of asymmetry caused by neo1ts.

The cytosolic actuator (A), nucleotide-binding (N), and phosphorylation (P) domains catalyze phosphate transfer from ATP to an Asp residue in the P domain and its subsequent dephosphorylation by the A domain. For P4-ATPases, unidirectional phospholipid translocation from the extracellular (or lumenal) leaflet to the cytosolic leaflet is associated with the dephosphorylation step (E2∼P to E1 conformational transition) (20Vestergaard A.L.

The membrane domain is usually composed of 10 transmembrane segments, which form transport substrate-binding sites and conduits through the membrane.

Budding yeast express the following five members of this subgroup: Dnf1, Dnf2, Dnf3, Drs2, and Neo1. Neo1 is the only P4-ATPase essential for viability, although Drs2 and the Dnf proteins are collectively essential (34Hua Z. Fatheddin P. Graham T.R.

However, gene duplication and subsequent specialization for substrate specificity, subcellular localization, modes of regulation, and binding partners may have contributed to the expansion. The substrate preferences and transport mechanism are best understood for Drs2 and Dnf1 and least well understood for Neo1 (35Baldridge R.D. Graham T.R.

The substrate transported by mammalian Neo1 orthologs ATP9A and ATP9B is also unknown. However, knockdown of the Caenorhabditis elegans Neo1 ortholog TAT-5 causes exposure of PE in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, suggesting that PE may be the preferred substrate (45Wehman A.M. Poggioli C. Schweinsberg P. Grant B.D. Nance J. The P4-ATPase TAT-5 inhibits the budding of extracellular vesicles in C. elegans embryos.Curr.

Exposure of aminophospholipids (PS and PE) on the cell surface can be detected using membrane-impermeable cytotoxic peptides that bind to the headgroup and subsequently generate a pore in the membrane. Papuamide A (Pap A) is potent cytotoxic agent that binds specifically to PS, and duramycin binds specifically to PE with affinity in the nanomolar range (46Parsons A.B. Lopez A. Givoni I.E.

Curvature-dependent recognition of ethanolamine phospholipids by duramycin and cinnamycin.Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1608-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Wild-type (WT) yeast cells are relatively resistant to Pap A and duramycin because most of these aminophospholipids are restricted to the inner cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. In contrast, flippase mutants expose aminophospholipids in the extracellular leaflet and are hypersensitive to these cytotoxic agents. Here, we use thermal inactivation of temperature conditional alleles of NEO1 (neo1ts) to explore the influence of Neo1 on plasma membrane phospholipid asymmetry and the relationship between Neo1, Drs2, and Dnf1 for this function. To test the influence of Neo1 on membrane asymmetry, we probed neo1 mutants with pore-forming cytotoxic peptides that preferentially bind to PS or PE exposed on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cells become hypersensitive to Pap A when they lose PS asymmetry and become hypersensitive to duramycin when they lose PE asymmetry. Growth of neo1ts (neo1-1 and neo1-2) mutants over a range of toxin concentrations was compared with WT and drs2Δ, a flippase mutant that is known to display a loss of PS and PE asymmetry. Growth of each strain was plotted relative to WT cells incubated in the absence of toxin (Fig. 1). These neo1-1 and neo1-2 alleles harbor a different set of mutations, and the neo1-1 mutant has a lower restrictive temperature, indicating that the Neo1-1 protein function is more strongly perturbed than Neo1-2 at a given temperature (e.g. 30 °C) (42Hua Z. Graham T.R. Requirement for neo1p in retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4971-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). At the neo1ts permissive growth temperature of 27 °C, neo1-1, neo1-2, and drs2Δ strains grew nearly as well as WT in the absence of Pap A or duramycin, but all three mutants were hypersensitive to both toxins relative to WT cells (Fig. 1, A and C). The neo1-1ts and neo1-2ts mutants showed a similar level of sensitivity to Pap A at 27 °C (IC50 of 2.5–3.5 μg/ml), whereas drs2Δ cells displayed the greatest Pap A sensitivity (IC50 of ∼1.0 μg/ml (Fig. 1A and Table 1)). Thus, drs2Δ had a greater loss of PS asymmetry at this temperature. In contrast, the neo1-1 and drs2Δ mutants were equally sensitive to duramycin at 27 °C, although the weaker neo1-2 mutant was less sensitive (IC50 of ∼10 μm versus ∼20 μm, see Table 1). Even though the temperature-conditional Neo1 mutants retained sufficient activity to support nearly WT growth at 27 °C (Fig. 1, 0 toxin), they clearly displayed a loss of PS and PE asymmetry. Thus, the mutant Neo1 proteins must have reduced activity at 27 °C relative to WT Neo1.TABLE 1Approximate IC50 values for strains treated with cytotoxic peptides at the indicated temperaturesIC5027 °C30 °CPapuamide AaValues were measured in microgram/ml.WT>6>6neo1-12.5–3.52.5–3.5neo1-22.5–3.52.5–3.5drs2Δ∼1.02.5–3.5DuramycinbValues were measured in micromolar.WT40–5050–60neo1-1∼10∼2neo1-2∼2030–40drs2Δ∼2030–40a Values were measured in microgram/ml.b Values were measured in micromolar. Open table in a new tab At 30 °C, the growth defect of the stronger temperature-sensitive mutant, neo1-1, became detectable as the rate of growth was reduced to 75% relative to WT cells in the absence of toxins (Fig. 1, B and D). Sensitivity of neo1-1 to Pap A was modestly enhanced at this semi-permissive temperature, but sensitivity of neo1-2 was unchanged relative to 27 °C (Fig. 1, A and B). The drs2Δ mutant actually became more resistant to Pap A and duramycin at 30 °C relative to 27 °C (Fig. 1, A and B), which likely reflects a greater ability of the remaining P4-ATPases to compensate for the loss of Drs2 at higher temperatures (42Hua Z. Graham T.R. Requirement for neo1p in retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4971-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Most striking was the extreme hypersensitivity of neo1-1 to duramycin at 30 °C (IC50 of ∼2 μm) (Fig. 1D and Table 1). At this temperature, neo1-2 and drs2Δ displayed a comparable hypersensitivity to duramycin. Importantly, a sufficient inactivation of neo1-1 to just give a detectable growth defect correlated with a substantial loss of PE asymmetry. These results suggest that the primary role of Neo1 is to establish PE asymmetry, but it also has a significant influence on PS asymmetry. Inactivation of Drs2 or the Dnf1/2 flippases also causes a loss of PS and PE asymmetry of the plasma membrane. Thus, it was possible that the expression or activity of these other P4-ATPases was perturbed in neo1ts mutants, thereby causing the loss of membrane asymmetry. Initially, we tested whether loss of Neo1 activity can influence expression of Drs/Dnf proteins. To test this, we quantified the expression of Dnf1-HA, Dnf2-HA, and Drs2 using Western blotting analysis (Fig. 2A). The HA tags were integrated into the chromosomal loci, and so Dnf1-HA and Dnf2-HA were expressed from their endogenous promoters. WT* cells lack the HA tags, and WT cells express both the tagged Dnf proteins and the WT Neo1 and Drs2. Equal amounts of total protein were loaded in each lane, which was confirmed by probing for Arf1 as a loading control. Although there appeared to be a partial reduction in the amount of Dnf1-HA and Drs2 in the neo1-1 cells relative to WT cells, these differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 2B, n = 3). We also tested whether the loss of PS and PE plasma membrane asymmetry in neo1ts cells could be explained by loss of Dnf1-HA and/or Dnf2-HA from the plasma membrane using subcellular fractionation. Dnf1 and Dnf2 are localized to Golgi, endosomes, and the plasma membrane, whereas Drs2 is normally localized to the TGN (34Hua Z. Fatheddin P. Graham T.R.

Therefore, several tests were used to assess the differences in trunk muscle function between 11 international and 14 national level judo practitioners (judokas). Trunk strength and endurance were assessed using isokinetic tests and core stability was assessed using two protocols: 1) sudden loading, to assess trunk responses to unexpected external perturbations; 2) stable and unstable sitting, to assess the participants’ ability to control trunk balance. No differences between groups were found for trunk flexor isokinetic strength, trunk responses against lateral and posterior loading and trunk control while sitting. However, international level judokas showed significantly higher trunk extensor isokinetic strength (p <0.05) and lower trunk angular displacement after anterior trunk loading (p <0.05) than national level judokas. Few and low (r < 0.512) significant correlations were found between strength, endurance and stability parameters, which suggests that trunk strength and endurance are not limiting factors for trunk stability in competitive judokas. These results support the importance of trunk extensor strength and trunk stability against forward perturbations in elite judo performance."
https://openalex.org/W2407113966,"Background Cediranib, an oral pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, failed to show benefit over lomustine in relapsed glioblastoma. One resistance mechanism for cediranib is up-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). This study aimed to determine if dual therapy with cediranib and the oral EGFR inhibitor gefitinib improved outcome in recurrent glioblastoma. Methods and Findings This was a multi-center randomized, two-armed, double-blinded phase II study comparing cediranib plus gefitinib versus cediranib plus placebo in subjects with first relapse/first progression of glioblastoma following surgery and chemoradiotherapy. The primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Secondary outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and radiologic response rate. Recruitment was terminated early following suspension of the cediranib program. 38 subjects (112 planned) were enrolled with 19 subjects in each treatment arm. Median PFS with cediranib plus gefitinib was 3.6 months compared to 2.8 months for cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.72, 90% CI; 0.41 to 1.26). Median OS was 7.2 months with cediranib plus gefitinib and 5.5 months with cediranib plus placebo (HR; 0.68, 90% CI; 0.39 to 1.19). Eight subjects (42%) had a partial response in the cediranib plus gefitinib arm versus five patients (26%) in the cediranib plus placebo arm. Conclusions Cediranib and gefitinib in combination is tolerated in patients with glioblastoma. Incomplete recruitment led to the study being underpowered. However, a trend towards improved survival and response rates with the addition of gefitinib to cediranib was observed. Further studies of the combination incorporating EGFR and VEGF inhibition are warranted. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01310855"
https://openalex.org/W2399881089,"Background Mucinous breast carcinoma (MC) is a special type of breast cancer that presents with a large amount of extracellular mucin. MC comprises approximately 4% of all invasive breast cancers. This type of tumor has a better prognosis and higher incidence in peri- and post-menopausal patients. Pathologically, there are two main subtypes of MC: pure and mixed. In this study, we describe 10 years of experience with MC at the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital in China, specifically, clinical data, histological findings and immunohistochemical features. Methods We identified MC patients who were diagnosed as operable and completed clinical treatment from January 2001 to January 2011. The clinicopathological data included the age at diagnosis, tumor size, TNM stage, presence and number of lymph node (LN) metastases, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) status and p53 expression. If the tumor was defined as mixed mucinous carcinoma (MMC), IHC was performed on a non-mucinous part, such as invasive ductal and lobular cancer. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of all MC patients using chi-square, one-way ANOVA and LSD tests. We also studied the correlations between all of the clinical parameters and LN metastasis in a binary logistic regression analysis. We used ten consecutive years of data that were collected at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. Results We identified 48 cases of pure mucinous carcinoma (PMC) and 77 cases of MMC. The 48 PMC cases consisted of 38 PMC-A and 10 PMC-B subtypes. The MMCs were divided into two groups, those with partial mixed mucinous breast carcinoma (pMMC, 58 cases) and those with main mixed mucinous breast carcinoma (mMMC, 19 cases). pMMC was defined by tumors with less than 50% mucinous components, while mMMC was defined by tumors where the mucinous component accounted for 50% to 90% of the tumor. No significant differences in the clinicopathological characteristics were noted between the patients with PMC-A and those with PMC-B. The tumor size was larger in the mMMC than PMC cases (44.84 mm vs. 30.06 mm, p = 0.021). The number of positive LN metastases was greater in pMMC than PMC patients (p = 0.024). The clinical stages were significantly different among the three groups, with the pMMC group having more stage III-IV patients than the other two groups (p = 0.005). The incidence of LN metastasis was also higher in the pMMC cases (pMMC vs. mMMC and PMC, 50% vs. 31.58% and 18.75%, p = 0.003). The PMC patients had much lower p53 expression than the other two groups (PMC vs. pMMC and mMMC, 27.08% vs. 55.17% and 57.89%, p = 0.007). The tumor size (>30mm), p53 expression and less proportion of the mucinous component are associated with risk of LN metastasis. Conclusion Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the tumor size, status of LN metastasis, clinical stage, and p53 mutation rate may differ between MMC and PMC patients. The tumor size (>30mm), p53 mutation and less proportion of the mucinous component should be considered risk factors of LN metastasis in MC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2396512494,"In vitro cell-based models of lung cancer are frequently employed to study invasion and the mechanisms behind metastasis. However, these models often study only one cell type with two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell cultures, which do not accurately reflect the complexity of inflammation in vivo. Here, a three-dimensional (3D) cell co-culture collagen gel model was employed, containing human lung adenocarcinoma cells (HCC), human lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5), and macrophages. Cell culture media and cell images were collected, and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production was monitored under different cell culture conditions. We found that simulating hypoxia and/or serum starvation conditions induced elevated secretion of VEGF in the 3D co-culture model in vitro, but not MMP-1; the morphology of HCC in the 2D versus the 3D co-culture system was extremely different. MMP-1 and VEGF were secreted at higher levels in mixed cell groups rather than mono-culture groups. Therefore, incorporating lung cancer cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages may better reflect physiological metastasis mechanisms compared to mono-culture systems. Tumour stromal cells, macrophages, and fibroblast cells may promote invasion and metastasis, which also provides a new direction for the design of therapies targeted at destroying the stroma of tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2403143312,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an important pathogen which causes huge economic damage globally in the swine industry. Current vaccination strategies provide only limited protection against PRRSV infection. Viperin is an interferon (IFN) stimulated protein that inhibits some virus infections via IFN-dependent or IFN-independent pathways. However, the role of viperin in PRRSV infection is not well understood. In this study, we cloned the full-length monkey viperin (mViperin) complementary DNA (cDNA) from IFN-α-treated African green monkey Marc-145 cells. It was found that the mViperin is up-regulated following PRRSV infection in Marc-145 cells along with elevated IRF-1 gene levels. IFN-α induced mViperin expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner and strongly inhibits PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells. Overexpression of mViperin suppresses PRRSV replication by blocking the early steps of PRRSV entry and genome replication and translation but not inhibiting assembly and release. And mViperin co-localized with PRRSV GP5 and N protein, but only interacted with N protein in distinct cytoplasmic loci. Furthermore, it was found that the 13-16 amino acids of mViperin were essential for inhibiting PRRSV replication, by disrupting the distribution of mViperin protein from the granular distribution to a homogeneous distribution in the cytoplasm. These results could be helpful in the future development of novel antiviral therapies against PRRSV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2400521744,"Skeletal muscle microvascular dysfunction contributes to disease severity in type 2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate a role for Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors in modulating endothelial cell phenotype. We hypothesized that a high-fat (HF) diet generates a dysfunctional vascular niche through an increased expression of endothelial FoxO. FoxO1 protein increased (+130%) in the skeletal muscle capillaries from HF compared to normal chow-fed mice. FoxO1 protein was significantly elevated in cultured endothelial cells exposed to the saturated fatty acid palmitate or the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. In HF-fed mice, endothelium-directed depletion of FoxO1/3/ 4(FoxOD) improved insulin sensitivity (+110%) compared to that of the controls (FoxOL/L). The number of skeletal muscle capillaries increased significantly in the HF-FoxOD mice. Transcript profiling of skeletal muscle identified significant increases in genes associated with angiogenesis and lipid metabolism in HF-FoxOD vs. HF-FoxOL/L mice. HF-FoxOD muscle also was characterized by a decrease in inflammation-related genes and an enriched M2 macrophage signature. We conclude that endothelial FoxO proteins promote insulin resistance in HF diet, which may in part result from FoxO proteins establishing an antiangiogenic and proinflammatory microenvironment within skeletal muscle. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the development of microvascular dysfunction in the progression of type 2 diabetes.—Nwadozi, E., Roudier, E., Rullman, E., Tharmalingam, S., Liu, H.-Y., Gustafsson, T., Haas, T.

Here, we identified and characterized the biological significance of a novel tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates Cx43, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). Activation of Tyk2 led to a decrease in Cx43 gap junction communication by increasing the turnover rate of Cx43 from the plasma membrane. Tyk2 directly phosphorylated Cx43 residues Tyr-247 and Tyr-265, leading to indirect phosphorylation on residues Ser-279/Ser-282 (MAPK) and Ser-368 (PKC). Although this phosphorylation pattern is similar to what has been observed following Src activation, the response caused by Tyk2 occurred when Src was inactive in NRK cells. Knockdown of Tyk2 at the permissive temperature (active v-Src) in LA-25 cells decreased Cx43 phosphorylation, indicating that although activation of Tyk2 and v-Src leads to phosphorylation of the same Cx43CT residues, they are not identical in level at each site. Additionally, angiotensin II activation of Tyk2 increased the intracellular protein level of Cx43 via STAT3.

https://openalex.org/W2401335555,"Background The study of the influence of life course occupational position (OP) on health in old age demands analysis of time patterns in both OP and health. We study associations between life course time patterns of OP and decline in grip strength in old age. Methods We analyze 5 waves from the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (n = 5108, ages 65–90). We use a pattern-mixture latent growth model to predict the level and decline in grip strength in old age by trajectory of life course OP. We extend and generalize the structured regression approach to establish the explanatory power of different life course models for both the level and decline of grip strength. Results Grip strength declined linearly by 0.70 kg (95% CI -0.74;-0.66) for men and 0.42 kg (95% CI -0.45;-0.39) for women per year. The level of men’s grip strength can best be explained by a critical period during midlife, with those exposed to low OP during this period having 1.67 kg (95% CI -2.33;-1.00) less grip strength. These differences remain constant over age. For women, no association between OP and levels of or decline in grip strength was found. Conclusions Men’s OP in midlife seems to be a critical period for the level of grip strength in old age. Inequalities remain constant over age. The integration of the structured regression approach and latent growth modelling offers new possibilities for life course epidemiology."

https://openalex.org/W2396263475,"Objectives The aim was to investigate which individual, psychosocial and physical neighborhood environmental factors associate with children’s switch to or maintenance of active/passive transport to school and to leisure time destinations during the transition from primary to secondary school. Methods Children (n = 313) filled out a questionnaire in the last year of primary school and 2 years later to assess socio-demographic characteristics and self-reported transport. One of their parents completed a questionnaire to assess parental perceptions of psychosocial and physical neighborhood environmental factors. Results The increase of the home-school distance was significantly associated with children’s switch to or maintenance of passive transport to school compared to a switch to (OR = 0.81; p = 0.03) and maintenance (OR = 0.87; p = 0.03) of active transport to school. Low SES was associated with children’s switch to active transport to school compared to maintenance of active transport (OR = 3.67; p = 0.07). For transport to leisure time destinations, other factors such as parental perceived neighborhood safety from traffic and crime (OR = 2.78; p = 0.004), a positive social norm (OR = 1.49; p = 0.08), positive attitudes (OR = 1.39; p = 0.08) (i.e. more benefits, less barriers) towards their children’s physical activity and poor walking/cycling facilities in the neighborhood (OR = 0.70; p = 0.06) were associated with children’s maintenance of active transport to leisure time destinations compared to a switch to or maintenance of passive transport. Conclusions This longitudinal study can give directions for interventions promoting children’s active transport during the transition to secondary school. It is necessary to promote different possibilities at primary school for children to use active transport when going to secondary school. Walking/cycling a part of the home-school trip can be a possible solution for children who will be living at non-feasible distances from secondary school. Providing safe neighborhoods, combined with programs for parents stimulating a positive social norm and positive attitudes towards physical activity during primary school, can be effective."

Here, we test the performance of a single transcriptome to understand whether it can provide a cost-efficient resource for species with large unknown genomes. Using RNA from six different tissues from a single Palearctic green toad (Bufo viridis) specimen and Hiseq2000, we obtained 22,5 Mio reads and publish >100,000 unigene sequences. To evaluate efficacy and quality, we first use this data to identify green toad specific candidate genes, known from other vertebrates for their role in sex determination and differentiation. Of a list of 37 genes, the transcriptome yielded 32 (87%), many of which providing the first such data for this non-model anuran species. However, for many of these genes, only fragments could be retrieved. In order to allow also applications to population genetics, we further used the transcriptome for the targeted development of 21 non-anonymous microsatellites and tested them in genetic families and backcrosses. Eleven markers were specifically developed to be located on the B. viridis sex chromosomes; for eight markers we can indeed demonstrate sex-specific transmission in genetic families. Depending on phylogenetic distance, several markers, which are sex-linked in green toads, show high cross-amplification success across the anuran phylogeny, involving nine systematic anuran families. Our data support the view that single transcriptome sequencing (based on multiple tissues) provides a reliable genomic resource and cost-efficient method for non-model amphibian species with large genome size and, despite limitations, should be considered as long as genome sequencing remains unaffordable for most species."

These environmental stimuli, which are sensed by the DosS heme group, result in autophosphorylation of a DosS His residue, followed by phosphotransfer to an Asp residue of the response regulator DosR. To clarify the mechanism of gaseous ligand recognition and signaling, we investigated the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the iron-bound CO and NO ligands by site-directed mutagenesis of Glu-87 and His-89. Autophosphorylation assays and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that Glu-87 has an important role in ligand recognition, whereas His-89 is essential for signal transduction to the kinase domain, a process for which Arg-204 is important. Mutation of Glu-87 to Ala or Gly rendered the protein constitutively active as a kinase, but with lower autophosphorylation activity than the wild-type in the Fe(II) and the Fe(II)-CO states, whereas the E87D mutant had little kinase activity except for the Fe(II)-NO complex. The H89R mutant exhibited attenuated autophosphorylation activity, although the H89A and R204A mutants were inactive as kinases, emphasizing the importance of these residues in communication to the kinase core. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of the wild-type and H89A mutant indicates the mutation does not alter the heme coordination number, spin state, or porphyrin deformation state, but it suggests that interdomain interactions are disrupted by the mutation. Overall, these results confirm the importance of the distal hydrogen-bonding network in ligand recognition and communication to the kinase domain and reveal the sensitivity of the system to subtle differences in the binding of gaseous ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2395745670,"The varied islands of the Pacific provide an ideal natural experiment for studying the factors shaping human impact on the environment. Previous research into pre-European deforestation across the Pacific indicated a major effect of environment but did not account for cultural variation or control for dependencies in the data due to shared cultural ancestry and geographic proximity. The relative importance of environment and culture on Pacific deforestation and forest replacement and the extent to which environmental impact is constrained by cultural ancestry therefore remain unexplored. Here we use comparative phylogenetic methods to model the effect of nine ecological and two cultural variables on pre-European Pacific forest outcomes at 80 locations across 67 islands. We show that some but not all ecological features remain important predictors of forest outcomes after accounting for cultural covariates and non-independence in the data. Controlling for ecology, cultural variation in agricultural intensification predicts deforestation and forest replacement, and there is some evidence that land tenure norms predict forest replacement. These findings indicate that, alongside ecology, cultural factors also predict pre-European Pacific forest outcomes. Although forest outcomes covary with cultural ancestry, this effect disappears after controlling for geographic proximity and ecology. This suggests that forest outcomes were not tightly constrained by colonists’ cultural ancestry, but instead reflect a combination of ecological constraints and the short-term responses of each culture in the face of those constraints."

C-terminal to these well-characterized domains is a glutamine-rich motif (aa 59–72).

The role of post-translational modifications in the glutamine-rich motif is still unclear. Several phosphorylation sites in this domain (Ser-62, Thr-64, Ser-68) enhance transcriptional activity, but are not well conserved among viral isolates (21Endo-Munoz L. Warby T. Harrich D.

In contrast, lysine 71 is a highly conserved residue found in 74% of HIV-1 isolates across all clades reported in the HIV-1 sequence compendium (22Foley B.L.T. Apetrei C. Hahn B. Mizrachi I. Mullins J. Rambaut A. Wolinsky S. Korber B. et al.HIV Sequence Compendium.Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group. Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2015Google Scholar). At this residue, polyubiquitylation at Lys-71 is required for full transactivation, but does not affect Tat stability (23Brès V. Kiernan R.E. Linares L.K. Chable-Bessia C. Plechakova O. Tréand C. Emiliani S. Peloponese J.M. Jeang K.T. Coux O. Scheffner M. Benkirane M. et al.A non-proteolytic role for ubiquitin in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We previously reported that Lys-51, within the Tat ARM, is monomethylated (K51me) by the methyltransferase KMT7 (also called SET7/9) (17Pagans S. Kauder S.E. Kaehlcke K. Sakane N. Schroeder S. Dormeyer W. Trievel R.C. Verdin E. Schnolzer M. Ott M. et al.The Cellular lysine methyltransferase Set7/9-KMT7 binds HIV-1 TAR RNA, monomethylates the viral transactivator Tat, and enhances HIV transcription.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 234-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Monomethylation at Lys-51 enhanced TAR RNA binding of Tat, and increased trimolecular complex formation between Tat, TAR, and P-TEFb. Interestingly, KMT7 itself was found to bind TAR RNA in band-shift assays, indicating that it could be recruited to the HIV promoter before Tat was produced (17Pagans S. Kauder S.E. Kaehlcke K. Sakane N. Schroeder S. Dormeyer W. Trievel R.C. Verdin E. Schnolzer M.

In in vitro methylation assays of ARM peptides (aa 44–59), we observed that that KMT7 fails to methylate residues other than Lys-51 in Tat (17Pagans S. Kauder S.E. Kaehlcke K. Sakane N. Schroeder S.

However, when we conducted the same in vitro assays using purified one-exon Tat proteins (Tat72), we observed additional methylation on Tat indicating that one or more additional methylation sites existed outside of the ARM region. In this study, we sought to further understand the role of KMT7 in the Tat transcription cycle by identifying and characterizing the additional modification(s). We hypothesized that understanding the full extent of Tat methylation would bring new insight into the regulation of Tat function and the role of KMT7 as an HIV-1 transcriptional cofactor. To determine whether Lys-51 is the only KMT7 methylation site in Tat, we performed in vitro methylation reactions with Tat peptides spanning aa 1–72 (Tat72). We observed substantial incorporation of [3H]S-adenosyl methionine ([3H]SAM) in Tat72 proteins carrying monomethylated Lys-51, indicating additional KMT7 methylation sites in Tat (Fig. 1, A and B). In Tat72 proteins with an acetyl group at Lys-50, [3H]SAM incorporation was also slightly decreased. This is consistent with previous observations that this modification reduces access of KMT7 to Lys-51 (18Sakane N. Kwon H.S. Pagans S. Kaehlcke K. Mizusawa Y. Kamada M. Lassen K.G. Chan J. Greene W.C. Schnoelzer M. Ott M. et al.Activation of HIV transcription by the viral Tat protein requires a demethylation step mediated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1).PLoS Pathog. 2011; (10.1371/journal.ppat.1002184)Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To specifically identify additional KMT7 methylation sites in Tat, we performed in vitro methylation reactions using non-radiolabeled SAM and subjected modified Tat proteins to MALDI-TOF MS/MS analysis developed to analyze Tat (18Sakane N. Kwon H.S. Pagans S. Kaehlcke K. Mizusawa Y. Kamada M. Lassen K.G. Chan J. Greene W.C. Schnoelzer M. Ott M. et al.Activation of HIV transcription by the viral Tat protein requires a demethylation step mediated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1).PLoS Pathog. 2011; (10.1371/journal.ppat.1002184)Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed monomethylation at a single additional site, Lys-71 (Fig. 1, C and D, supplemental Table S-1) in two distinct peptides in reactions with KMT7, but not in reactions with a control enzyme KMT1E (also called SETDB1) or no enzyme (Fig. 1C). In one peptide, only Lys-71 was monomethylated (Fig. 1D, left); in the other, both Lys-51 and Lys-71 were monomethylated (Fig. 1D, right). Neither Lys-51 nor Lys-71 was dimethylated, underscoring the function of KMT7 as a monomethyltransferase in Tat. Next, we tested whether pre-modification of Lys-71 in Tat72 peptides affects in vitro methylation by KMT7. Premethylation of Lys-71 markedly decreased [3H]SAM incorporation while Lys-51 pre-methylation had a lesser effect. Finally, premethylation of both Lys-51 and Lys-71 abolished methylation of Tat, demonstrating that there are no additional targets for KMT7 in Tat (Fig. 2A). These findings support Lys-51 and Lys-71 as the sole sites for KMT7 monomethylation in Tat72. To better quantify dynamics of KMT7-mediated methylation of Tat72 proteins, we used pre-modified Tat proteins in a modified kinetic radiometric assay (24Houtz R.L. Royer M. Salvucci M.E. et al.Partial purification and characterization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit ϵN-methyltransferase.Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 913-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After testing for linearity with time and KMT7 enzyme concentrations, kinetics assays were performed with various concentrations of Tat72 proteins (Fig. 2B). Methyltransferase activity was hyperbolic, and all Tat proteins except the Tat K51/K71me doubly modified form followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The doubly modified form had very little methylation, consistent with our observations using autoradiography (Fig. 2A). The catalytic turnover (kcat) and Michaelis constant (Km) of the Tat K51me proteins were 62% lower relative to the unmodified proteins. Interestingly, the kcat of the K71me proteins decreased by 83% but the Km decreased only 21%. Thus, the methylation efficiency (kcat/Km) on K51me protein was similar to that of the unmodified protein, but the K71me was 78% less than that on control proteins. Furthermore, almost no methylation was detected in the K51/K71me protein. Together, these data support the model that Lys-71 is preferred over Lys-51 as a target for KMT7 in Tat (Fig. 2, B and C) and there are no additional sites in Tat72 for KMT7 monomethylation. To examine Lys-71 methylation in vivo, we coexpressed Tat101 bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag together with either a KMT7 or empty vector in HEK293T cells for 24 h. We first purified Tat from lysates by FLAG immunoprecipitation, followed by SDS-PAGE separation. The separated Tat protein was subjected to MALDI-TOF MS/MS, which showed that Lys-71 was monomethylated only when KMT7 was overexpressed (Fig. 3, A and B; supplemental Table S-2). This suggests that the fraction of Tat that is naturally monomethylated at Lys-71 in HEK293T cells may be small compared with the unmodified form. Next, we analyzed Tat methylation in J-Lat A2 T cells, in which expression of FLAG-tagged Tat101 is controlled by its natural promoter and induced by stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (25Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. et al.HIV reproducibly establishes a latent infection after acute infection of T cells in vitro.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Tat expression was induced with TNFα, FLAG-affinity-purified, and analyzed by MS. We identified a peptide fragment of 1032.627 Da, corresponding to Tat aa 70–78 with a monomethyl group at Lys-71 (Fig. 3C). MS/MS confirmed the monomethylation at Lys-71 (Fig. 3D, supplemental Table S-2). Together these findings show that Tat Lys-71 is monomethylated in Jurkat T cells under conditions mimicking natural HIV infection and that this modification can be induced by KMT7 overexpression in 293T cells. We confirmed these results using newly generated modification-specific polyclonal antibodies. We previously published methods to produce and characterize mono-, di-, and tri-methyl Tat-specific antibodies at Lys-51 (26Pagans S. Sakane N. Schnölzer M. Ott M. et al.Characterization of HIV Tat modifications using novel methyl-lysine-specific antibodies.Methods. 2011; 53: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following these methods, we focused on two chemically synthesized K71me 11-mer peptides (type 1 and type 2) (Fig. 4A). Peptide 1 (aa 63–72) ends with the first exon, and peptide 2 (aa 67–76) spans both Tat exons. Cysteine residues are added to the C-terminal end of the peptides for purification purposes as described (26Pagans S. Sakane N. Schnölzer M. Ott M. et al.Characterization of HIV Tat modifications using novel methyl-lysine-specific antibodies.Methods. 2011; 53: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After antigen-purification of the modification-specific antibodies, we performed dot-blot analysis of various chemically modified Tat proteins (Fig. 4B). Type 1 antibodies reacted with all synthetic Tat72 proteins (WT, K51me, K71me, K50Ac, and K51/K71me), but type 2 antibodies detected only the K71me Tat72 proteins. Similar results were obtained by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 4C). The type 2 antibodies were highly specific for Tat72 proteins carrying a monomethyl group at K71, and the type 1 antibodies recognized all Tat proteins. Type 2 antibodies detected several cellular bands in whole cell lysates (data not shown). Therefore, for further analysis, we used type 2 TatK71me antibodies on FLAG-immunopurified samples. To confirm the specificity of the type 2 antibodies in vivo, we overexpressed WT or FLAG-tagged Tat101 proteins carrying mutations at Lys-71, Lys-51, or Lys-50 in 293T cells. After FLAG immunoprecipitation, we detected K71me Tat only in WT, Lys-50 and Lys-51 mutants, but not in Lys-71 mutants (Fig. 5A). This finding indicates that endogenous KMT7 is sufficient to methylate Lys-71 in cells. Furthermore, we were able to increase TatK71me by coexpressing Tat101 with WT KMT7 relative to coexpression with a catalytically inactive KMT7 mutant (H297A). Importantly, no change in methylation was observed on the K71R mutant (Fig. 5B). Next, we determined whether the K71me antibodies are able to detect Tat72 in T cells. For this, we used an HIV-1 mini-genome to generate Jurkat cell lines that stably express Tat72, as described for the Jurkat A2 cells (27Jordan A. Defechereux P. Verdin E. et al.The site of HIV-1 integration in the human genome determines basal transcriptional activity and response to Tat transactivation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1726-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We sorted for cells with high-level GFP expression, and transduced them with lentiviruses containing one of two shRNAs targeting KMT7 (a and b) or a scrambled shRNA (Scr). The lentiviral constructs also contained a puromycin resistance gene, which allowed us to select for shRNA-expressing cells. After selection, shRNA-expressing cells were lysed and subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation, and Tat K71me levels were determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). Knockdown of KMT7 was robust; in accordance, Tat K71me levels were reduced by 51% in cells treated with the KMT7b shRNA and by 28% in cells treated with KMT7a shRNA (Fig. 5B, bottom). These results underscore the role of KMT7 as an important K71 methyltransferase for both forms of Tat in T cells. Since a substantial amount of Tat remained methylated at Lys-71 despite the knockdown, we suspect that a small residual pool of KMT7 may be sufficient to modify a proportion of Tat proteins, or perhaps another enzyme is capable of monomethylating Tat in cells. A number of substrates modified by KMT7 are altered in their stability by downstream changes in their polyubiquitylation (28Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. et al.Methylation, a new epigenetic mark for protein stability.Epigenetics. 2009; 4: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because Lys-71 has previously been reported as a site for polyubiqitination (23Brès V. Kiernan R.E. Linares L.K. Chable-Bessia C. Plechakova O. Tréand C. Emiliani S. Peloponese J.M. Jeang K.T. Coux O. Scheffner M. Benkirane M. et al.A non-proteolytic role for ubiquitin in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we examined whether Lys-71 methylation by KMT7 affects the stability of Tat in Jurkat cell lines expressing fluorescent Tat101-Dendra fusion proteins generated for this purpose (25Jordan A. Bisgrove D. Verdin E. et al.HIV reproducibly establishes a latent infection after acute infection of T cells in vitro.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1868-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The Tat-Dendra system has been used to determine the Tat half-life in flow cytometry and microscopy studies (29Razooky B.S. Pai A. Aull K. Rouzine I.M. Weinberger L.S. et al.A hardwired HIV latency program.Cell. 2015; 160: 990-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 30Singh A. Razooky B.S. Dar R.D. Weinberger L.S. et al.Dynamics of protein noise can distinguish between alternate sources of gene-expression variability.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2012; 8: 607Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To knock down KMT7, we transduced Tat-Dendra cells with the lentiviral vectors expressing scrambled or KMT7b shRNAs used for Fig. 5B. After puromycin selection, we monitored effects of KMT7 knockdown on Tat half-life only in successfully transduced cells. Knockdown of KMT7 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B). Expression of WT or K71R Tat-Dendra proteins was induced with TNFα. After 16–20 h of TNFα treatment, cycloheximide was added to inhibit de novo production of Tat. Cells were fixed at various times, and Tat expression was determined by flow cytometry of Dendra (Fig. 6A). Tat stability did not differ in cells transduced with control and KMT7 shRNAs, excluding any prominent effect of K71 methylation on Tat stability (Fig. 6C). In cells expressing scrambled shRNA, the K71R Tat mutant had a slightly longer half-life than WT Tat (10.9 versus 9.0 h, p = 0.043). However, time-lapse single-cell microscopy of Tat-Dendra cells revealed no statistical difference in the half-lives of WT and K71R Tat in the absence of shRNAs (Fig. 6D). Together, these data affirm previous findings that Lys-71 modifications are not involved in Tat protein stability (29Razooky B.S. Pai A. Aull K. Rouzine I.M. Weinberger L.S. et al.A hardwired HIV latency program.Cell. 2015; 160: 990-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Previously, we found that KMT7-mediated monomethylation of Tat Lys-51 enhances interactions between Tat and TAR RNA and P-TEFb and activates HIV gene expression (17Pagans S. Kauder S.E. Kaehlcke K. Sakane N. Schroeder S. Dormeyer W. Trievel R.C. Verdin E. Schnolzer M. Ott M. et al.The Cellular lysine methyltransferase Set7/9-KMT7 binds HIV-1 TAR RNA, monomethylates the viral transactivator Tat, and enhances HIV transcription.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 234-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of Lys-71 monomethylation on Tat transactivation, we transfected plasmids expressing WT or mutant Tat101 (K51R, K71R, or K51/71R) into TZMBL cells, which express firefly luciferase from the integrated HIV LTR when functional Tat is expressed (31Montefiori D.C. et al.Measuring HIV neutralization in a luciferase reporter gene assay.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 485: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Transactivation was ∼50% lower in the Tat K51R and Tat K71R mutants than in WT Tat at three different plasmid concentrations, confirming that these residues are important for Tat transactivation (17Pagans S. Kauder S.E. Kaehlcke K. Sakane N. Schroeder S. Dormeyer W. Trievel R.C. Verdin E. Schnolzer M. Ott M. et al.The Cellular lysine methyltransferase Set7/9-KMT7 binds HIV-1 TAR RNA, monomethylates the viral transactivator Tat, and enhances HIV transcription.Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 7: 234-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 23Brès V.

Benkirane M. et al.A non-proteolytic role for ubiquitin in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 promoter.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Transactivation was almost completely lost when both Lys-51 and Lys-71 were mutated, underscoring their combined importance in Tat transactivation. All Tat proteins were expressed at similar levels as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7A). To test whether monomethylation at Lys-71 by KMT7 contributes to Tat transactivation, we knocked down KMT7 expression using KMT7b shRNAs in TZMBL cells before transfection with WT Tat or K71R mutant Tat101. Knockdown of KMT7 decreased the transcriptional activity of Tat WT but had no effect on K71R mutant Tat. Evidently, KMT7 activates Tat transactivation, at least in part, through Lys-71 monomethylation (Fig. 7B). Knockdown of KMT7 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7B). These findings indicate that Lys-71 monomethylation, rather than regulating Tat stability, plays a positive role in the transcriptional activity of Tat. HIV-1 Tat is a potent viral transactivator that undergoes extensive post-translational modifications. Here, we expand the role of KMT7 in Tat function by identifying Lys-71 as a second monomethylation site. We found that Lys-71 is monomethylated in both functional HIV-1 Tat101 and Tat72 splice variants, underscoring its importance throughout the HIV-1 life cycle. We identified KMT7 as a robust Tat Lys-71 monomethyltransferase in both in vitro and in vivo assays. Although KMT7 substrates often have perturbed stability, mutation of Lys-71 or knock down of KMT7 did not affect the stability of Tat. Instead, Lys-71 monomethylation is important for the transcriptional activity of Tat through a yet unresolved mechanism. Notably, in vitro methylation and enzymology experiments indicate that the preferred methylation site of KMT7 is Lys-71 rather than Lys-51, previously identified as a target of KMT7. Although KMT7 has no known stri"
https://openalex.org/W2401714987,"The immunological synapse (IS), a dynamic and organized junction between T-cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs), is critical for initiating adaptive immunity. The actin cytoskeleton plays a major role in T-cell reorganization during IS formation, and we previously reported that transgelin-2, an actin-binding protein expressed in T-cells, stabilizes cortical F-actin, promoting T-cell activation in response to antigen stimulation. Transgelin-2 is also highly expressed in B-cells, although no specific function has been reported. In this study, we found that deficiency in transgelin-2 (TAGLN2-/-) in B-cells had little effect on B-cell development and activation, as measured by the expression of CD69, MHC class II molecules, and CD80/86. Nevertheless, in B-cells, transgelin-2 accumulated in the IS during the interaction with T-cells. These results led us to hypothesize that transgelin-2 may also be involved in IS stability in B-cells, thereby influencing T-cell function. Notably, we found that transgelin-2 deficiency in B-cells reduced T-cell activation, as determined by the release of IL-2 and interferon-γ and the expression of CD69. Furthermore, the reduced T-cell activation was correlated with reduced B-cell-T-cell conjugate formation. Collectively, these results suggest that actin stability in B-cells during IS formation is critical for the initiation of adaptive T-cell immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2953209396,"Background Understanding how leukocytes in the cervicovaginal and colorectal mucosae respond to pathogens, and how medical interventions affect these responses, is important for developing better tools to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. An effective cryopreservation protocol for these cells following their isolation will make studying them more feasible. Methods and Findings To find an optimal cryopreservation protocol for mucosal mononuclear leukocytes, we compared cryopreservation media and procedures using human vaginal leukocytes and confirmed our results with endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Specifically, we measured the recovery of viable vaginal T cells and macrophages after cryopreservation with different cryopreservation media and handling procedures. We found several cryopreservation media that led to recoveries above 75%. Limiting the number and volume of washes increased the fraction of cells recovered by 10–15%, possibly due to the small cell numbers in mucosal samples. We confirmed that our cryopreservation protocol also works well for both endocervical and colorectal leukocytes. Cryopreserved leukocytes had slightly increased cytokine responses to antigenic stimulation relative to the same cells tested fresh. Additionally, we tested whether it is better to cryopreserve endocervical cells on the cytobrush or in suspension. Conclusions Leukocytes from cervicovaginal and colorectal tissues can be cryopreserved with good recovery of functional, viable cells using several different cryopreservation media. The number and volume of washes has an experimentally meaningful effect on the percentage of cells recovered. We provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol with best practices for cryopreservation of mucosal leukocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2396470106,"To effectively and efficiently reduce the morbidity and mortality that may be caused by outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, it is very important for public health agencies to make informed decisions for controlling the spread of the disease. Such decisions must incorporate various kinds of intervention strategies, such as vaccinations, school closures and border restrictions. Recently, researchers have paid increased attention to searching for effective vaccine distribution strategies for reducing the effects of pandemic outbreaks when resources are limited. Most of the existing research work has been focused on how to design an effective age-structured epidemic model and to select a suitable vaccine distribution strategy to prevent the propagation of an infectious virus. Models that evaluate age structure effects are common, but models that additionally evaluate geographical effects are less common. In this paper, we propose a new SEIR (susceptible—exposed—infectious šC recovered) model, named the hybrid SEIR-V model (HSEIR-V), which considers not only the dynamics of infection prevalence in several age-specific host populations, but also seeks to characterize the dynamics by which a virus spreads in various geographic districts. Several vaccination strategies such as different kinds of vaccine coverage, different vaccine releasing times and different vaccine deployment methods are incorporated into the HSEIR-V compartmental model. We also design four hybrid vaccination distribution strategies (based on population size, contact pattern matrix, infection rate and infectious risk) for controlling the spread of viral infections. Based on data from the 2009–2010 H1N1 influenza epidemic, we evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed HSEIR-V model and study the effects of different types of human behaviour in responding to epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2398317646,"“Notohippidae” is a probably paraphyletic family of medium sized notoungulates with complete dentition and early tendency to hypsodonty. They have been recorded from early Eocene to early Miocene, being particularly diverse by the late Oligocene. Although Rhynchippus equinus Ameghino is one of the most frequent notohippids in the fossil record, there are scarce data about cranial osteology other than the classical descriptions which date back to the early last century. In this context, we describe the exceptionally preserved specimen MPEF PV 695 (based on CT scanning technique and 3D reconstruction) with the aim of improving our knowledge of the species, especially regarding auditory region (petrosal, tympanic and surrounding elements), sphenoidal and occipital complexes. Besides a modular description of the whole skull, osteological correlates identified on the basicranium are used to infer some soft-tissue elements, especially those associated with vessels that supply the head, mainly intracranially. One of the most informative elements was the petrosal bone, whose general morphology matches that expected for a toxodont. The endocranial surface, together with the surrounding parietal, basisphenoid, occipital, and squamosal, enabled us to propose the location and communication of main venous sinuses of the lateral head wall (temporal, inferior and sigmoid sinuses), whereas the tympanic aspect and the identification of a posterior carotid artery canal provided strong evidence in support of an intratympanic course of the internal carotid artery, a controversial issue among notoungulates. Regarding the arrangement of tympanic and paratympanic spaces, the preservation of the specimen allowed us to appreciate the three connected spaces that constitute a heavily pneumatized middle ear; the epitympanic sinus, the tympanic cavity itself, and the ventral expansion of the tympanic cavity through the notably inflated bullae. We hope this study stimulates further inquires and provides potentially informative data for future research involving other representatives of the order."
https://openalex.org/W2407795832,"Background The fibrotic capsule that surrounds silicone implants consists mainly of collagen. The FDA-approved collagenase of the bacterium clostridium histolyticum provides a reasonable treatment option. Safety and efficacy at the female breast site must be evaluated before clinical utilization. Materials and Methods We incubated 20 samples of fibrotic capsule as well as 12 full thickness skin grafts harvested from the female breast site for 24 hours with different doses of collagenase. Outcome measures involved histological assessment of thickness and density of the capsule tissue as well as the skin grafts. Furthermore, we performed a collagen assay and immunohistochemistry staining for collagen subtypes. Results Collagenase treatment was able to degrade human capsule contracture tissue ex-vivo. The remaining collagen subtype after degradation was type 4 only. 0.3 mg/ml of collagenase was most effective in reducing capsule thickness when compared with higher concentrations. Of note, effectiveness was inversely related to capsule density, such that there was less reduction in thickness with higher capsule densities and vice versa. Furthermore, the application of 0.3mg/ml collagenase did not lead to thinning or perforation of full thickness skin grafts. Conclusion Adjustment of collagenase dose will depend on thickness and density of the contracted capsule. A concentration of 0.3mg/ml seems to be safe and effective in an ex-vivo setting. The remaining collagen subtype 4 is suitable to serve as a neo-capsule/acellular tissue matrix. Collagenase treatment for capsular contracture may soon become a clinical reality."

The development of inhibitors for these enzymes is complicated by the diversity and flexibility of their substrate-binding sites, motivating research into their structure and function. In this study, we examined the conformational properties of the Bacillus cereus β-lactamase II in the presence of chemical denaturants using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. The apoenzyme was found to unfold cooperatively, with a Gibbs free energy of stabilization (ΔG0) of 32 ± 2 kJ·mol−1. For holoBcII, a first non-cooperative transition leads to multiple interconverting native-like states, in which both zinc atoms remain bound in an apparently unaltered active site, and the protein displays a well organized compact hydrophobic core with structural changes confined to the enzyme surface, but with no catalytic activity. Two-dimensional NMR data revealed that the loss of activity occurs concomitantly with perturbations in two loops that border the enzyme active site. A second cooperative transition, corresponding to global unfolding, is observed at higher denaturant concentrations, with ΔG0 value of 65 ± 1.4 kJ·mol−1. These combined data highlight the importance of the two zinc ions in maintaining structure as well as a relatively well defined conformation for both active site loops to maintain enzymatic activity.

https://openalex.org/W2398448086,"Differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into the pluripotent state by cell-cell fusion. In the pluripotent state, reprogrammed cells may then self-renew and differentiate into all three germ layers. Fusion-induced reprogramming also epigenetically modifies the somatic cell genome through DNA demethylation, X chromosome reactivation, and histone modification. In this study, we investigated whether fusion with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) also reprograms genomic imprinting patterns in somatic cells. In particular, we examined imprinting changes in parthenogenetic neural stem cells fused with biparental ESCs, as well as in biparental neural stem cells fused with parthenogenetic ESCs. The resulting hybrid cells expressed the pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog. In addition, methylation of several imprinted genes except Peg3 was comparable between hybrid cells and ESCs. This finding indicates that reprogramming by cell fusion does not necessarily reverse the status of all imprinted genes to the state of pluripotent fusion partner."
https://openalex.org/W2404397288,"Sorghum vegetative tissues are becoming increasingly important for biofuel production. The composition of sorghum stem tissues is influenced by genotype, environment and photoperiod sensitivity, and varies widely between varieties and also between different stem tissues (outer rind vs inner pith). Here, the amount of cellulose, (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan, arabinose and xylose in the stems of twelve diverse sorghum varieties, including four photoperiod-sensitive varieties, was measured. At maturity, most photoperiod-insensitive lines had 1% w/w (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in stem pith tissue whilst photoperiod-sensitive varieties remained in a vegetative stage and accumulated up to 6% w/w (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan in the same tissue. Three sorghum lines were chosen for further study: a cultivated grain variety (Sorghum bicolor BTx623), a sweet variety (S. bicolor Rio) and a photoperiod-sensitive wild line (S. bicolor ssp. verticilliflorum Arun). The Arun line accumulated 5.5% w/w (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan and had higher SbCslF6 and SbCslH3 transcript levels in pith tissues than did photoperiod-insensitive varieties Rio and BTx623 (<1% w/w pith (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan). To assess the digestibility of the three varieties, stem tissue was treated with either hydrolytic enzymes or dilute acid and the release of fermentable glucose was determined. Despite having the highest lignin content, Arun yielded significantly more glucose than the other varieties, and theoretical calculation of ethanol yields was 10 344 L ha-1 from this sorghum stem tissue. These data indicate that sorghum stem (1,3;1,4)-β-glucan content may have a significant effect on digestibility and bioethanol yields. This information opens new avenues of research to generate sorghum lines optimised for biofuel production."
https://openalex.org/W2406537652,"Lipids have been identified as important carbon sources for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to utilize in vivo. Thus gluconeogenesis bears a key role for Mtb to survive and replicate in host. A rate-limiting enzyme of gluconeogenesis, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is encoded by the gene glpX. The functions of glpX were studied in M. marinum, a closely related species to Mtb. The glpX deletion strain (ΔglpX) displayed altered gluconeogenesis, attenuated virulence, and altered bacterial proliferation. Metabolic profiles indicate an accumulation of the FBPase substrate, fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) and altered gluconeogenic flux when ΔglpX is cultivated in a gluconeogenic carbon substrate, acetate. In both macrophages and zebrafish, the proliferation of ΔglpX was halted, resulting in dramatically attenuated virulence. Intracellular ΔglpX exhibited an elongated morphology, which was also observed when ΔglpX was grown in a gluconeogenic carbon source. This elongated morphology is also supported by the observation of unseparated multi-nucleoid cell, indicating that a complete mycobacterial division in vivo is correlated with intact gluconeogenesis. Together, our results indicate that glpX has essential functions in gluconeogenesis, and plays an indispensable role in bacterial proliferation in vivo and virulence of M. marinum."
https://openalex.org/W2407804399,"To compare the effectiveness of an educational board game with interactive didactic instruction for teaching optometry students elements of the core optometric curriculum.Forty-two optometry students were divided into two GPA-matched groups and assigned to either 12 hours of game play (game group) or 12 hours of interactive didactic instruction (lecture group). The same material from the core optometric curriculum was delivered to both groups. Game play was accomplished via an original board game. Written examinations assessed change in knowledge level. A post-intervention opinion survey assessed student attitudes.There was no significant difference in pre- or post-intervention test scores between the lecture and game groups (Pre-test: p = 0.9; Post-test: p = 0.5). Post-intervention test scores increased significantly from baseline (Game group: 29.3% gain, Didactic group: 31.5% gain; p<0.001 for each). The score increase difference between groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.6). The post-intervention attitude survey did not reveal any significant between group differences (p = 0.5).Our results indicate that an educational game and interactive didactic instruction can be equally effective in teaching optometry students basic and applied science. Furthermore, both modes of instruction have the potential to be equally engaging and enjoyable experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2397851629,"Performance monitoring depends on cortical structures that are also activated in vicarious monitoring. While many experiments have shown that vicarious and on-line monitoring have a similar basis, most such experiments have focused on simple tasks. In order to assess the effect of non-contingent feedback on vicarious monitoring, 23 young volunteer adults were evaluated: in one session, they performed a rule-based category formation task, receiving no feedback on their performance. In a second session, Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were obtained while participants passively reviewed performances attributed to themselves and peers they had previously rated as either socially close or distant. Feedback Related Negativity (FRN) and Feedback Related P300 (fP300) components were analyzed with respect to feedback valence and agent. Results show that both components can be elicited through non-contingent feedback related to prior performance. In addition, FRN waves are modulated by the valence of the feedback, and fP300 is modulated by the agent to whom performance feedback is attributed. This experiment constitutes a novel approach to the evaluation of ERP correlates of vicarious monitoring through non-contingent feedback and its relations to empathy processing."
