https://openalex.org/W1984347606,"Sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in host blood vessels is a key triggering event in the pathogenesis of severe childhood malaria, which is responsible for about one million deaths every year. Sequestration is mediated by specific interactions between members of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family and receptors on the endothelial lining. Severe childhood malaria is associated with expression of specific PfEMP1 subtypes containing domain cassettes (DCs) 8 and 13 (ref. 3), but the endothelial receptor for parasites expressing these proteins was unknown. Here we identify endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which mediates the cytoprotective effects of activated protein C, as the endothelial receptor for DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1. We show that EPCR binding is mediated through the amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDRα1) of DC8 and group A PfEMP1 subfamilies, and that CIDRα1 interferes with protein C binding to EPCR. This PfEMP1 adhesive property links P. falciparum cytoadhesion to a host receptor involved in anticoagulation and endothelial cytoprotective pathways, and has implications for understanding malaria pathology and the development of new malaria interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2141602707,"Previous investigations of the core gene regulatory circuitry that controls the pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells have largely focused on the roles of transcription, chromatin and non-coding RNA regulators. Alternative splicing represents a widely acting mode of gene regulation, yet its role in regulating ES-cell pluripotency and differentiation is poorly understood. Here we identify the muscleblind-like RNA binding proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, as conserved and direct negative regulators of a large program of cassette exon alternative splicing events that are differentially regulated between ES cells and other cell types. Knockdown of MBNL proteins in differentiated cells causes switching to an ES-cell-like alternative splicing pattern for approximately half of these events, whereas overexpression of MBNL proteins in ES cells promotes differentiated-cell-like alternative splicing patterns. Among the MBNL-regulated events is an ES-cell-specific alternative splicing switch in the forkhead family transcription factor FOXP1 that controls pluripotency. Consistent with a central and negative regulatory role for MBNL proteins in pluripotency, their knockdown significantly enhances the expression of key pluripotency genes and the formation of induced pluripotent stem cells during somatic cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W1518056784,"G-protein-gated inward rectifier K(+) (GIRK) channels allow neurotransmitters, through G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation, to control cellular electrical excitability. In cardiac and neuronal cells this control regulates heart rate and neural circuit activity, respectively. Here we present the 3.5 Å resolution crystal structure of the mammalian GIRK2 channel in complex with βγ G-protein subunits, the central signalling complex that links G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation to K(+) channel activity. Short-range atomic and long-range electrostatic interactions stabilize four βγ G-protein subunits at the interfaces between four K(+) channel subunits, inducing a pre-open state of the channel. The pre-open state exhibits a conformation that is intermediate between the closed conformation and the open conformation of the constitutively active mutant. The resultant structural picture is compatible with 'membrane delimited' activation of GIRK channels by G proteins and the characteristic burst kinetics of channel gating. The structures also permit a conceptual understanding of how the signalling lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and intracellular Na(+) ions participate in multi-ligand regulation of GIRK channels."
https://openalex.org/W2167660970,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) has developed a small membrane protein, p7, which remarkably can self-assemble into a large channel complex that selectively conducts cations. We wanted to examine the structural solution that the viroporin adopts in order to achieve selective cation conduction, because p7 has no homology with any of the known prokaryotic or eukaryotic channel proteins. The activity of p7 can be inhibited by amantadine and rimantadine, which are potent blockers of the influenza M2 channel and licensed drugs against influenza infections. The adamantane derivatives have been used in HCV clinical trials, but large variation in drug efficacy among the various HCV genotypes has been difficult to explain without detailed molecular structures. Here we determine the structures of this HCV viroporin as well as its drug-binding site using the latest nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technologies. The structure exhibits an unusual mode of hexameric assembly, where the individual p7 monomers, i, not only interact with their immediate neighbours, but also reach farther to associate with the i+2 and i+3 monomers, forming a sophisticated, funnel-like architecture. The structure also points to a mechanism of cation selection: an asparagine/histidine ring that constricts the narrow end of the funnel serves as a broad cation selectivity filter, whereas an arginine/lysine ring that defines the wide end of the funnel may selectively allow cation diffusion into the channel. Our functional investigation using whole-cell channel recording shows that these residues are critical for channel activity. NMR measurements of the channel-drug complex revealed six equivalent hydrophobic pockets between the peripheral and pore-forming helices to which amantadine or rimantadine binds, and compound binding specifically to this position may allosterically inhibit cation conduction by preventing the channel from opening. Our data provide a molecular explanation for p7-mediated cation conductance and its inhibition by adamantane derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2133200098,"The purpose of this work was to determine the effects of varying levels of dietary protein on body composition and muscle protein synthesis during energy deficit (ED). A randomized controlled trial of 39 adults assigned the subjects diets providing protein at 0.8 (recommended dietary allowance; RDA), 1.6 (2×-RDA), and 2.4 (3×-RDA) g kg(-1) d(-1) for 31 d. A 10-d weight-maintenance (WM) period was followed by a 21 d, 40% ED. Body composition and postabsorptive and postprandial muscle protein synthesis were assessed during WM (d 9-10) and ED (d 30-31). Volunteers lost (P<0.05) 3.2 ± 0.2 kg body weight during ED regardless of dietary protein. The proportion of weight loss due to reductions in fat-free mass was lower (P<0.05) and the loss of fat mass was higher (P<0.05) in those receiving 2×-RDA and 3×-RDA compared to RDA. The anabolic muscle response to a protein-rich meal during ED was not different (P>0.05) from WM for 2×-RDA and 3×-RDA, but was lower during ED than WM for those consuming RDA levels of protein (energy × protein interaction, P<0.05). To assess muscle protein metabolic responses to varied protein intakes during ED, RDA served as the study control. In summary, we determined that consuming dietary protein at levels exceeding the RDA may protect fat-free mass during short-term weight loss."
https://openalex.org/W2076879573,"HIV-1 causes CD4+T-cell death through viral integration by stimulation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a protein known to act in the p53 damage response pathway for double-stranded DNA breaks, in activated cells. It is known that CD4+ helper T cells, key immune regulators, are eliminated by HIV-1 infection, but how the virus causes cell death has been unclear. Here Gary Nabel and colleagues show that HIV-1 integration is both necessary and sufficient to trigger CD4+ T-cell death, and that integration triggers cell death through activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), part of the DNA repair mechanism, and phosphorylation of p53. This work may help to explain how reservoirs of virus are established in HIV-infected subjects, and suggests that treatment with integrase or DNA-PK inhibitors might prolong CD4 cell survival and delay the development of AIDS. Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has infected more than 60 million people and caused nearly 30 million deaths worldwide1, ultimately the consequence of cytolytic infection of CD4+ T cells. In humans and in macaque models, most of these cells contain viral DNA and are rapidly eliminated at the peak of viraemia2,3,4, yet the mechanism by which HIV-1 induces helper T-cell death has not been defined. Here we show that virus-induced cell killing is triggered by viral integration. Infection by wild-type HIV-1, but not an integrase-deficient mutant, induced the death of activated primary CD4 lymphocytes. Similarly, raltegravir, a pharmacologic integrase inhibitor, abolished HIV-1-induced cell killing both in cell culture and in CD4+ T cells from acutely infected subjects. The mechanism of killing during viral integration involved the activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a central integrator of the DNA damage response, which caused phosphorylation of p53 and histone H2AX. Pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PK abolished cell death during HIV-1 infection in vitro, suggesting that processes which reduce DNA-PK activation in CD4 cells could facilitate the formation of latently infected cells that give rise to reservoirs in vivo. We propose that activation of DNA-PK during viral integration has a central role in CD4+ T-cell depletion, raising the possibility that integrase inhibitors and interventions directed towards DNA-PK may improve T-cell survival and immune function in infected individuals."

https://openalex.org/W1969091108,"There is increasing evidence for the involvement of lipid membranes in both the functional and pathological properties of α-synuclein (α-Syn). Despite many investigations to characterize the binding of α-Syn to membranes, there is still a lack of understanding of the binding mode linking the properties of lipid membranes to α-Syn insertion into these dynamic structures. Using a combination of an optical biosensing technique and in situ atomic force microscopy, we show that the binding strength of α-Syn is related to the specificity of the lipid environment (the lipid chemistry and steric properties within a bilayer structure) and to the ability of the membranes to accommodate and remodel upon the interaction of α-Syn with lipid membranes. We show that this interaction results in the insertion of α-Syn into the region of the headgroups, inducing a lateral expansion of lipid molecules that can progress to further bilayer remodeling, such as membrane thinning and expansion of lipids out of the membrane plane. We provide new insights into the affinity of α-Syn for lipid packing defects found in vesicles of high curvature and in planar membranes with cone-shaped lipids and suggest a comprehensive model of the interaction between α-Syn and lipid bilayers. The ability of α-Syn to sense lipid packing defects and to remodel membrane structure supports its proposed role in vesicle trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2166604661,"Electronic properties such as current flow are generally independent of the electron's spin angular momentum, an internal degree of freedom possessed by quantum particles. The spin Hall effect, first proposed 40 years ago, is an unusual class of phenomena in which flowing particles experience orthogonally directed, spin-dependent forces--analogous to the conventional Lorentz force that gives the Hall effect, but opposite in sign for two spin states. Spin Hall effects have been observed for electrons flowing in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as GaAs and InGaAs (refs 2, 3) and for laser light traversing dielectric junctions. Here we observe the spin Hall effect in a quantum-degenerate Bose gas, and use the resulting spin-dependent Lorentz forces to realize a cold-atom spin transistor. By engineering a spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupling field for our quantum gas, we explicitly introduce and measure the requisite spin-dependent Lorentz forces, finding them to be in excellent agreement with our calculations. This 'atomtronic' transistor behaves as a type of velocity-insensitive adiabatic spin selector, with potential application in devices such as magnetic or inertial sensors. In addition, such techniques for creating and measuring the spin Hall effect are clear prerequisites for engineering topological insulators and detecting their associated quantized spin Hall effects in quantum gases. As implemented, our system realizes a laser-actuated analogue to the archetypal semiconductor spintronic device, the Datta-Das spin transistor."
https://openalex.org/W2082737008,"Close to optimal doping, the copper oxide superconductors show 'strange metal' behavior, suggestive of strong fluctuations associated with a quantum critical point. Such a critical point requires a line of classical phase transitions terminating at zero temperature near optimal doping inside the superconducting 'dome'. The underdoped region of the temperature-doping phase diagram from which superconductivity emerges is referred to as the 'pseudogap' because evidence exists for partial gapping of the conduction electrons, but so far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap is a distinct phase or a continuous evolution of physical properties on cooling. Here we report that the pseudogap in YBCO cuprate superconductors is a distinct phase, bounded by a line of phase transitions. The doping dependence of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the superconducting dome. From this we conclude that quantum criticality drives the strange metallic behavior and therefore superconductivity in the cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W2020798808,"Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is being evaluated in multiple clinical trials. Our current approach to adoptive immunotherapy is based on a second generation CAR (designated CD19RCD28) that signals through a CD28 and CD3-ζ endodomain. T cells are electroporated with DNA plasmids from the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase system to express this CAR. Stable integrants of genetically modified T cells can then be retrieved when co-cultured with designer artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2 and 21. Here, we reveal how the platform technologies of SB-mediated transposition and CAR-dependent propagation on aAPC were adapted for human application. Indeed, we have initiated clinical trials in patients with high-risk B-lineage malignancies undergoing autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We describe the process to manufacture clinical grade CD19-specific T cells derived from healthy donors. Three validation runs were completed in compliance with current good manufacturing practice for Phase I/II trials demonstrating that by 28 days of co-culture on γ-irradiated aAPC ∼1010 T cells were produced of which >95% expressed CAR. These genetically modified and propagated T cells met all quality control testing and release criteria in support of infusion."
https://openalex.org/W2021251343,"Recently, we have shown that CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling plays an important role in gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells. Here, we explored the effect of gemcitabine on this resistance mechanism. Our data demonstrate that gemcitabine induces CXCR4 expression in two PC cell lines (MiaPaCa and Colo357) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gemcitabine-induced CXCR4 expression is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation because it is abrogated by pretreatment of PC cells with the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. CXCR4 up-regulation by gemcitabine correlates with time-dependent accumulation of NF-κB and HIF-1α in the nucleus. Enhanced binding of NF-κB and HIF-1α to the CXCR4 promoter is observed in gemcitabine-treated PC cells, whereas their silencing by RNA interference causes suppression of gemcitabine-induced CXCR4 expression. ROS induction upon gemcitabine treatment precedes the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB and HIF-1α, and suppression of ROS diminishes these effects. The effect of ROS on NF-κB and HIF-1α is mediated through activation of ERK1/2 and Akt, and their pharmacological inhibition also suppresses gemcitabine-induced CXCR4 up-regulation. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that nuclear accumulation of NF-κB results from phosphorylation-induced degradation of IκBα, whereas HIF-1α up-regulation is NF-κB-dependent. Lastly, our data demonstrate that gemcitabine-treated PC cells are more motile and exhibit significantly greater invasiveness against a CXCL12 gradient. Together, these findings reinforce the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in gemcitabine resistance and point toward an unintended and undesired effect of chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1983956798,"Understanding the growth rate of the continental crust through time is a fundamental issue in Earth sciences. The isotopic signatures of noble gases in the silicate Earth (mantle, crust) and in the atmosphere afford exceptional insight into the evolution through time of these geochemical reservoirs. However, no data for the compositions of these reservoirs exists for the distant past, and temporal exchange rates between Earth's interior and its surface are severely under-constrained owing to a lack of samples preserving the original signature of the atmosphere at the time of their formation. Here, we report the analysis of argon in Archaean (3.5-billion-year-old) hydrothermal quartz. Noble gases are hosted in primary fluid inclusions containing a mixture of Archaean freshwater and hydrothermal fluid. Our analysis reveals Archaean atmospheric argon with a (40)Ar/(36)Ar value of 143 ± 24, lower than the present-day value of 298.6 (for which (40)Ar has been produced by the radioactive decay of the potassium isotope (40)K, with a half-life of 1.25 billion years; (36)Ar is primordial in origin). This ratio is consistent with an early development of the felsic crust, which might have had an important role in climate variability during the first half of Earth's history."

https://openalex.org/W2065436991,"Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is being absorbed into the ocean, altering seawater chemistry, with potentially negative impacts on a wide range of marine organisms. The early life stages of invertebrates with internal and external aragonite structures may be particularly vulnerable to this ocean acidification. Impacts to cephalopods, which form aragonite cuttlebones and statoliths, are of concern because of the central role they play in many ocean ecosystems and because of their importance to global fisheries. Atlantic longfin squid (Doryteuthis pealeii), an ecologically and economically valuable taxon, were reared from eggs to hatchlings (paralarvae) under ambient and elevated CO2 concentrations in replicated experimental trials. Animals raised under elevated pCO2 demonstrated significant developmental changes including increased time to hatching and shorter mantle lengths, although differences were small. Aragonite statoliths, critical for balance and detecting movement, had significantly reduced surface area and were abnormally shaped with increased porosity and altered crystal structure in elevated pCO2-reared paralarvae. These developmental and physiological effects could alter squid paralarvae behavior and survival in the wild, directly and indirectly impacting marine food webs and commercial fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2115144412,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a cellular and whole body energy sensor with manifold functions in regulating energy homeostasis, cell morphology and proliferation in health and disease. Here we apply multiple, complementary in vitro and in vivo interaction assays to identify several isoforms of glutathione S-transferase (GST) as direct AMPK binding partners: Pi-family member rat GSTP1 and Mu-family members rat GSTM1, as well as Schistosoma japonicum GST. GST/AMPK interaction is direct and involves the N-terminal domain of the AMPK β-subunit. Complex formation of the mammalian GSTP1 and -M1 with AMPK leads to their enzymatic activation and in turn facilitates glutathionylation and activation of AMPK in vitro. GST-facilitated S-glutathionylation of AMPK may be involved in rapid, full activation of the kinase under mildly oxidative physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2030605465,"Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is a pathogenic yeast and the cause of cryptococcal meningitis. Prevalence of disease between males and females is skewed, with males having an increased incidence of disease. Based on the reported gender susceptibility differences to Cn in the literature, we used clinical isolates from Botswanan HIV-infected patients to test the hypothesis that different gender environments exerted different selective pressures on Cn. When we examined this data set, we found that men had significantly higher risk of death despite having significantly higher CD4+ T lymphocyte counts upon admittance to the hospital. These observations suggested that Cn strains are uniquely adapted to different host gender environments and that the male immune response may be less efficient in controlling Cn infection. To discriminate between these possibilities, we tested whether there were phenotypic differences between strains isolated from males and females and whether there was an interaction between Cn and the host immune response. Virulence phenotypes showed that Cn isolates from females had longer doubling times and released more capsular glucoronoxylomannan (GXM). The presence of testosterone but not 17-β estradiol was associated with higher levels of GXM release for a laboratory strain and 28 clinical isolates. We also measured phagocytic efficiency, survival of Cn, and amount of killing of human macrophages by Cn after incubation with four isolates. While macrophages from females phagocytosed more Cn than macrophages from males, male macrophages had a higher fungal burden and showed increased killing by Cn. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that differential interaction between Cn and macrophages within different gender environments contribute to the increased prevalence of cryptococcosis in males. This could be related to differential expression of cryptococcal virulence genes and capsule metabolism, changes in Cn phagocytosis and increased death of Cn-infected macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2059059864,"In Mediterranean intermittent streams, the hydrological fragmentation in summer and the successive water flow re-convergence in autumn allow exploring how local processes shape the microbial community within the same habitat. The objectives of this study were to determine how bacterial community composition responded to hydrological fragmentation in summer, and to evaluate whether the seasonal shifts in community composition predominate over the effects of episodic habitat fragmentation. The bacterial community was assessed along the intermittent stream Fuirosos (Spain), at different levels of phylogenetic resolution by in situ hybridization, fingerprinting, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The hydrological fragmentation of the stream network strongly altered the biogeochemical conditions with the depletion of oxidized solutes and caused changes in dissolved organic carbon characteristics. In the isolated ponds, beta-Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria increased their abundance with a gradual reduction of the alpha-diversity as pond isolation time increased. Moreover, fingerprinting analysis clearly showed a shift in community composition between summer and autumn. In the context of a seasonal shift, the temporary stream fragmentation simultaneously reduced the microbial dispersion and affected local environmental conditions (shift in redox regime and quality of the dissolved organic matter) tightly shaping the bacterioplankton community composition."
https://openalex.org/W2059055334,"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) commonly suffer from acute exacerbations (AECOPD) and display varying disease severity. However, there is no available biomarker for the classification of AECOPD. This study is aimed at investigating the sputum cellular profiles to classify patients with AECOPD.A total of 83 patients with AECOPD and 26 healthy controls were recruited. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, and their lung function was examined. The phenotypes of sputum inflammatory cells were characterised, and the concentrations of sputum and serum amyloid-A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured. Based on the sputum inflammatory cell profiles, individual patients were categorized into one of the four subgroups with inflammatory eosinophilic, neutrophilic, paucigranulocytic, and mixed granulocytic AECOPD. Most AECOPD patients were reevaluated within 12-14 months after discharge.There were 10 (12%) eosinophilic, 36 (43%) neutrophilic, 5 (6%) mixed granulocytic, and 32 (39%) paucigranulocytic AECOPD patients. The patients with mixed granulocytic or neutrophilic AECOPD had a higher BODE score, more sputum inflammatory cells, lower lung function, and longer hospital stay, accompanied by higher concentrations of sputum MMP-9, IL-6 and CRP, and serum SAA, IL-6 and CRP. Notably, 83% of patients with neutrophilic AECOPD displayed evidence of bacterial infection and many of them responded poorly to standard therapies. In addition, patients with mixed granulocytic or neutrophilic stable COPD remained at lower lung functions and higher levels of inflammation.Patients with AECOPD display heterogeneous inflammation, and the profiles of sputum inflammatory cells may be used as valuable biomarkers for the classification of AECOPD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2021776571,"Actin filament polymerization plays a critical role in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. However, our knowledge regarding modulation of the actin cytoskeleton in smooth muscle just begins to accumulate. In this study, stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh) induced an increase in the association of the adapter protein c-Abl interactor 1 (Abi1) with neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) (an actin-regulatory protein) in smooth muscle cells/tissues. Furthermore, contractile stimulation activated N-WASP in live smooth muscle cells as evidenced by changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer efficiency of an N-WASP sensor. Abi1 knockdown by lentivirus-mediated RNAi inhibited N-WASP activation, actin polymerization, and contraction in smooth muscle. However, Abi1 silencing did not affect myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation at Ser-19 in smooth muscle. In addition, c-Abl tyrosine kinase and Crk-associated substrate (CAS) have been shown to regulate smooth muscle contraction. The interaction of Abi1 with c-Abl and CAS has not been investigated. Here, contractile activation induced formation of a multiprotein complex including c-Abl, CAS, and Abi1. Knockdown of c-Abl and CAS attenuated the activation of Abi1 during contractile activation. More importantly, Abi1 knockdown inhibited c-Abl phosphorylation at Tyr-412 and the interaction of c-Abl with CAS. These results suggest that Abi1 is an important component of the cellular process that regulates N-WASP activation, actin dynamics, and contraction in smooth muscle. Abi1 is activated by the c-Abl-CAS pathway, and Abi1 reciprocally controls the activation of its upstream regulator c-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2102011250,"So far retinylidene proteins (∼rhodopsin) have not been discovered in thermophilic organisms. In this study we investigated and characterized a microbial rhodopsin derived from the extreme thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus, which lives in a hot spring at around 75 °C. The gene for the retinylidene protein, named thermophilic rhodopsin (TR), was chemically synthesized with codon optimization. The codon optimized TR protein was functionally expressed in the cell membranes of Escherichia coli cells and showed active proton transport upon photoillumination. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that the purified TR bound only all-trans-retinal as a chromophore and showed an absorption maximum at 530 nm. In addition, TR exhibited both photocycle kinetics and pH-dependent absorption changes, which are characteristic of rhodopsins. Of note, time-dependent thermal denaturation experiments revealed that TR maintained its absorption even at 75 °C, and the denaturation rate constant of TR was much lower than those of other proton pumping rhodopsins such as archaerhodopsin-3 (200 ×), Haloquadratum walsbyi bacteriorhodopsin (by 10-times), and Gloeobacter rhodopsin (100 ×). Thus, these results suggest that microbial rhodopsins are also distributed among thermophilic organisms and have high stability. TR should allow the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of ion transport and protein folding."
https://openalex.org/W2063025076,"Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) is a devastating progressive disease in which normal lung structure and function is compromised by scarring. Lung fibrosis can be caused by thoracic radiation, injury from chemotherapy and systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis that involve inflammatory responses. CDDO-Me (Methyl 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)dien-28-oate, Bardoxolone methyl) is a novel triterpenoid with anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties as shown by our in vitro studies. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that CDDO-Me would reduce lung inflammation, fibrosis and lung function impairment in a bleomycin model of lung injury and fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, mice received bleomycin via oropharyngeal aspiration (OA) on day zero and CDDO-Me during the inflammatory phase from days -1 to 9 every other day. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were harvested on day 7 to evaluate inflammation, while fibrosis and lung function were evaluated on day 21. On day 7, CDDO-Me reduced total BALF protein by 50%, alveolar macrophage infiltration by 40%, neutrophil infiltration by 90% (p≤0.01), inhibited production of the inflammatory cytokines KC and IL-6 by over 90% (p≤0.001), and excess production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGFβ by 50%. CDDO-Me also inhibited α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin mRNA by 50% (p≤0.05). On day 21, CDDO-Me treatment reduced histological fibrosis, collagen deposition and αSMA production. Lung function was significantly improved at day 21 by treatment with CDDO-Me, as demonstrated by respiratory rate and dynamic compliance. These new findings reveal that CDDO-Me exhibits potent anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties in vivo. CDDO-Me is a potential new class of drugs to arrest inflammation and ameliorate fibrosis in patients who are predisposed to lung injury and fibrosis incited by cancer treatments (e.g. chemotherapy and radiation) and by systemic autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2036996804,"The large dicynodont Eubrachiosaurus browni from the Upper Triassic Popo Agie Formation of Wyoming is redescribed. Eubrachiosaurus is a valid taxon that differs from Placerias hesternus, with which it was previously synonymized, by greater anteroposterior expansion of the scapula dorsally and a very large, nearly rectangular humeral ectepicondyle with a broad supinator process. Inclusion of Eubrachiosaurus in a revised phylogenetic analysis of anomodont therapsids indicates that it is a stahleckeriid closely related to the South American genera Ischigualastia and Jachaleria. The recognition of Eubrachiosaurus as a distinct lineage of North American dicynodonts, combined with other recent discoveries in the eastern USA and Europe, alters our perception of Late Triassic dicynodont diversity in the northern hemisphere. Rather than being isolated relicts in previously therapsid-dominated regions, Late Triassic stahleckeriid dicynodonts were continuing to disperse and diversify, even in areas like western North America that were otherwise uninhabited by coeval therapsids (i.e., cynodonts)."
https://openalex.org/W1967225900,"Background This study examines the effect of initiating medications with anticholinergic activity on the cognitive functions of older persons. Methods Participants were 896 older community-dwelling, Catholic clergy without baseline dementia. Medication data was collected annually. The Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale was utilized to identify use of a medication with probable or definite anticholinergic activity. Participants had at least two annual cognitive evaluations. Results Over a mean follow-up of 10 years, the annual rate of global cognitive function decline for never users, prevalent users, and incident users was −0.062 (SE = 0.005), −0.081(SE = 0.011), and −0.096 (SE = 0.007) z-score units/year, respectively. Compared to never users, incident users had a more rapid decline (difference = −0.034 z-score units/year, SE = 0.008, p<0.001) while prevalent users did not have a significantly more rapid decline (p = 0.1). Conclusions Older persons initiating a medication with anticholinergic activity have a steeper annual decline in cognitive functioning than those who are not taking these medications."
https://openalex.org/W2117771926,"Background Research in 2007 showed that World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations were largely based on expert opinion, rarely used systematic evidence-based methods, and did not follow the organization's own “Guidelines for Guidelines”. In response, the WHO established a “Guidelines Review Committee” (GRC) to implement and oversee internationally recognized standards. We examined the impact of these changes on WHO guideline documents and explored senior staff's perceptions of the new procedures. Methods and Findings We used the AGREE II guideline appraisal tool to appraise ten GRC-approved guidelines from nine WHO departments, and ten pre-GRC guidelines matched by department and topic. We interviewed 20 senior staff across 16 departments and analyzed the transcripts using the framework approach. Average AGREE II scores for GRC-approved guidelines were higher across all six AGREE domains compared with pre-GRC guidelines. The biggest changes were noted for “Rigour of Development” (up 37.6%, from 30.7% to 68.3%) and “Editorial Independence” (up 52.7%, from 20.9% to 73.6%). Four main themes emerged from the interviews: (1) high standards were widely recognized as essential for WHO credibility, particularly with regard to conflicts of interest; (2) views were mixed on whether WHO needed a single quality assurance mechanism, with some departments purposefully bypassing the procedures; (3) staff expressed some uncertainties in applying the GRADE approach, with departmental staff concentrating on technicalities while the GRC remained concerned the underlying principles were not fully institutionalized; (4) the capacity to implement the new standards varied widely, with many departments looking to an overstretched GRC for technical support. Conclusions Since 2007, WHO guideline development methods have become more systematic and transparent. However, some departments are bypassing the procedures, and as yet neither the GRC, nor the quality assurance standards they have set, are fully embedded within the organization."

Methodology/Principal Findings The correlations between antibiotic consumption and MDR-GNB HAIs at a 2,700-bed primary care and tertiary referral center in Taiwan between 2002 and 2009 were assessed. MDR-GNB HAI referred to a HAI caused by MDR-Enterobacteriaceae, MDR-Pseudomonas aeruginosa or MDR-Acinetobacter spp. Consumptions of individual antibiotics and MDR-GNB HAI series were first evaluated for trend over time. When a trend was significant, the presence or absence of associations between the selected clinically meaningful antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption was further explored using cross-correlation analyses. Significant major findings included (i) increased consumptions of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, piperacillin/tazobactam, and fluoroquinolones, (ii) decreased consumptions of non-extended-spectrum cephalosporins, natural penicillins, aminopenicillins, ureidopenicillin and aminoglycosides, and (iii) decreasing trend in the incidence of the overall HAIs, stable trends in GNB HAIs and MDR-GNB HAIs throughout the study period, and increasing trend in HAIs caused by carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter spp. since 2006. HAIs due to CR-Acinetobacter spp. was found to positively correlate with the consumptions of carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminopenicillins/β-lactamase inhibitors, piperacillin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolones, and negatively correlate with the consumptions of non-extended-spectrum cephalosporins, penicillins and aminoglycosides. No significant association was found between the increased use of piperacilllin/tazobactam and increasing HAIs due to CR-Acinetobacter spp. Conclusions The trend in overall HAIs decreased and trends in GNB HAIs and MDR-GNB HAIs remained stable over time suggesting that the infection control practice was effective during the study period, and the escalating HAIs due to CR- Acinetobacter spp. were driven by consumptions of broad-spectrum antibiotics other than piperacillin/tazobactam. Our data underscore the importance of antibiotic stewardship in the improvement of the trend of HAIs caused by Acinetobacter spp."
https://openalex.org/W1964096618,"The 5-HT3A receptor homology model, based on the partial structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor from Torpedo marmorata, reveals an asymmetric ion channel with five portals framed by adjacent helical amphipathic (HA) stretches within the 114-residue loop between the M3 and M4 membrane-spanning domains. The positive charge of Arg-436, located within the HA stretch, is a rate-limiting determinant of single channel conductance (γ). Further analysis reveals that positive charge and volume of residue 436 are determinants of 5-HT3A receptor inward rectification, exposing an additional role for portals. A structurally unresolved stretch of 85 residues constitutes the bulk of the M3-M4 loop, leaving a >45-Å gap in the model between M3 and the HA stretch. There are no additional structural data for this loop, which is vestigial in bacterial pentameric ligand-gated ion channels and was largely removed for crystallization of the Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-activated pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. We created 5-HT3A subunit loop truncation mutants, in which sequences framing the putative portals were retained, to determine the minimum number of residues required to maintain their functional integrity. Truncation to between 90 and 75 amino acids produced 5-HT3A receptors with unaltered rectification. Truncation to 70 residues abolished rectification and increased γ. These findings reveal a critical M3-M4 loop length required for functions attributable to cytoplasmic portals. Examination of all 44 subunits of the human neurotransmitter-activated Cys-loop receptors reveals that, despite considerable variability in their sequences and lengths, all M3-M4 loops exceed 70 residues, suggesting a fundamental requirement for portal integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2074365347,"Gene-based tests of association are frequently applied to common SNPs (MAF>5%) as an alternative to single-marker tests. In this analysis we conduct a variety of simulation studies applied to five popular gene-based tests investigating general trends related to their performance in realistic situations. In particular, we focus on the impact of non-causal SNPs and a variety of LD structures on the behavior of these tests. Ultimately, we find that non-causal SNPs can significantly impact the power of all gene-based tests. On average, we find that the “noise” from 6–12 non-causal SNPs will cancel out the “signal” of one causal SNP across five popular gene-based tests. Furthermore, we find complex and differing behavior of the methods in the presence of LD within and between non-causal and causal SNPs. Ultimately, better approaches for a priori prioritization of potentially causal SNPs (e.g., predicting functionality of non-synonymous SNPs), application of these methods to sequenced or fully imputed datasets, and limited use of window-based methods for assigning inter-genic SNPs to genes will improve power. However, significant power loss from non-causal SNPs may remain unless alternative statistical approaches robust to the inclusion of non-causal SNPs are developed."
https://openalex.org/W2032287609,"Overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular energy failure are associated with neuroinflammatory disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. Transgenic mice homozygous for human ApoE4 gene, a well known AD and atherosclerosis animal model, show decreased levels of ATP, increased inflammatory cytokines level and accumulation of beta amyloid in the brain. All these findings are considered responsible for triggering cognitive decline. We have demonstrated that a single administration of the bacterial E. coli protein toxin CNF1 to aged apoE4 mice, beside inducing a strong amelioration of both spatial and emotional memory deficits, favored the cell energy restore through an increment of ATP content. This was accompanied by a modulation of cerebral Rho and Rac1 activity. Furthermore, CNF1 decreased the levels of beta amyloid accumulation and interleukin-1β expression in the hippocampus. Altogether, these data suggest that the pharmacological modulation of Rho GTPases by CNF1 can improve memory performances in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease via a control of neuroinflammation and a rescue of systemic energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2086742936,"Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are key mediators of insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling. In mice, deletion of Irs1 is associated with profound growth retardation and increased longevity whereas Irs2-deficiency causes diabetes and female infertility. Clinical studies suggest that diabetes and obesity diminish male fertility. However, the role of IRS proteins in male reproduction is unknown. We observed that testis weight is reduced by 45% in Irs2-deficient mice as compared with control males. The weight of these organs in Irs1(-/-) males was similar to controls; however, since Irs1-deficient mice are 50% smaller, testis weight:body weight was increased in this model. Neonatal Irs2(-/-) mice also exhibited reduced testicular size, suggesting that impairments in this model occur during development. Histological examination of testicular cross sections from Irs2(-/-) mice revealed normal cellular associations without obvious abnormalities in the seminiferous epithelium. Reduced testicular weight was associated with fewer Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes, elongated spermatids, and epididymal spermatozoa. However, Leydig cell number and the concentration of serum testosterone were equivalent between Irs2-deficient and control males. Testicular weight was reduced similarly in non-diabetic and diabetic Irs2(-/-) mice, indicating that hyperglycemia does not compound the effects of Irs2 deletion on impaired testis development. Expression of Irs1, Irs3, and Irs4 was comparable between experimental groups. Collectively, our results demonstrate that IRS2 plays a critical role in testicular development, potentially by mediating IGF1 signalling during embryonic and early postnatal development."
https://openalex.org/W2009614729,"Alpha4 (α4) is a key regulator of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and mTOR in steps essential for cell-cycle progression. α4 forms a complex with PP2A and MID1, a microtubule-associated ubiquitin E3 ligase that facilitates MID1-dependent regulation of PP2A and the dephosphorylation of MID1 by PP2A. Ectopic overexpression of α4 is associated with hepatocellular carcinomas, breast cancer, and invasive adenocarcinomas. Here, we provide data suggesting that α4 is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation mediated by MID1. In cells stably expressing a dominant-negative form of MID1, significantly elevated levels of α4 were observed. Treatment of cells with the specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, resulted in a 3-fold increase in α4 in control cells and a similar level in mutant cells. Using in vitro assays, individual MID1 E3 domains facilitated monoubiquitination of α4, whereas full-length MID1 as well as RING-Bbox1 and RING-Bbox1-Bbox2 constructs catalyzed its polyubiquitination. In a novel non-biased functional screen, we identified a leucine to glutamine substitution at position 146 within Bbox1 that abolished MID1-α4 interaction and the subsequent polyubiquitination of α4, indicating that direct binding to Bbox1 was necessary for the polyubiquitination of α4.

Furthermore, its ectopic overexpression in immunocompromised mice is sufficient to transform embryonic kidney cells (30.Chen L.P. Lai Y.D. Li D.C. Zhu X.N. Yang P. Li W.X. Zhu W. Zhao J. Li X.D.

These studies suggest that it may be oncogenic. As a key regulator of mTOR activity, which is a major anti-cancer target, it is important to understand how α4 is regulated. Here we demonstrate for the first time that α4 is directly regulated both in vitro and in vivo by MID1-mediated polyubiquitination. MDCK cells were cultured at 37 °C in DMEM (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Scientific) and 1× GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). To generate MID1delCTD-expressing cell lines, MDCK cells were transfected with either a pEGFP-C2-MID1delCTD or pEGFP-C2 control expression construct (35.Cox T.C. Allen L.R. Cox L.L. Hopwood B. Goodwin B. Haan E. Suthers G.K. New mutations in MID1 provide support for loss of function as the cause of X-linked Opitz syndrome.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2553-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). The MID1delCTD mutant involved a construct in which the MID1 reading frame was truncated near the start of the SPRY/B30.2 domain (K491stop; Fig. 1A). Stable cell lines were selected in 0.6 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) for 10 days. Antibiotic-resistant clonal cells were obtained by diluting the cells into 96-well plates at a concentration of less than one cell per well, and the growth of clonal cells was monitored under a light microscope as well as a fluorescent microscope for GFP expression. To confirm the expression of both intact GFP and GFP-MID1delCTD in selected clonal lines, extracts from each were examined by Western blotting. Briefly, cells cultured in a 10-cm plate were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientific) with protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture, EDTA-free, Thermo Scientific) for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were collected with a cell scraper and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8–16%, Precise Protein Gel, Thermo Scientific, IL) and semi-dry-transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, probed with anti-GFP (ab290, Abcam), and developed using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Thermo Scientific). GFP control and MID1delCTD-expressing MDCK cell lines were cultured with or without 10 μm lactacystin (Millipore) in complete DMEM media for 3 h before cell lysates were prepared as described above. Western blot analysis was performed using a mouse anti-α4 antibody (clone 5F6, Millipore) and a goat anti-mouse peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (catalog #A-4416, Sigma). The membranes were then stripped and probed with a rabbit anti-GAPDH antibody (catalog #IMG-5143A, IMGENEX, San Diego, CA) and a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (catalog #A-0545, Sigma) as a loading control. A digital image of the Western blot bands was obtained by scanning non-saturating x-ray film exposures, and the band intensities were quantified with Image J. A two-tailed t test was used (p < 0.05) to determine the significance of differences in normalized protein levels in the control and mutant cells. Because of the much faster generation time of bacteria over yeast and the fact that plasmid DNA is more readily recovered from bacteria, we chose the BacterioMatch® II Two Hybrid system as a means to efficiently and functionally screen randomly generated mutations in MID1 B-box1 for loss of ability to bind α4. The ability of two proteins of interest to interact in this system is assessed by growth of co-transformants on selective medium containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor of histidine synthesis, and confirmed by growth of transformants on dual-selective medium containing both 3-AT and streptomycin. Assessment of self-activation of fusion constructs and testing of the expected interaction pairs was performed essentially as described (BacterioMatch® II Two Hybrid System Vector kit manual, Stratagene). To generate bait and prey constructs, full-length α4 was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, gel-purified, and cloned into similarly digested pTRG vector (BacterioMatch® II, Stratagene). The MID1 Bbox1 domain was amplified from full-length MID1 using the M1BB1-F (5′-GTG AAT TCT ACT AGT GCC GAG AAG GTC CTC TGC CAG TT-3′) and M1BB1-R (5′-GTG TCT CGA GTC AGT CCG GAA TTG GCT CAA TCA GAC-3′) primers, and the product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and directionally ligated into similarly digested pBT to generate pBT-M1BB1. The resultant pTRG-αlpha4 and pBT-M1BB1 constructs were confirmed by sequencing. In this system, α4 and the MID1 B-box1 domain showed a robust and specific interaction. To generate random mutations in the MID1 B-box1 domain, we employed an error-prone PCR mutagenesis protocol. Briefly, the same M1BB1-F and M1BB1-R primers, as utilized in the initial cloning of the wild-type MID1 B-box1 domain into pBT, were used with a custom-prepared non-proofreading DNA polymerase (CusTaq) in a reaction containing 300 nm MnCl2. The addition of MnCl2 at this concentration was predicted to generate an average of 1 mutation per ∼200 bp and, therefore, approximately a single mutation per 180-bp M1BB1 fragment. In addition, dNTP ratios were biased, with dCTP and dTTP concentrations each increased from 200 nm to 1 mm. Resultant M1BB1 PCR fragments were subsequently directionally cloned into pBT after EcoRI-XhoI double digestion. The mutagenized M1BB1-pBT ligation mix was then transformed into the bacterial host that already contained the pTRG-α4. 850 individual colonies were subsequently patched together with positive, negative, and self-activation control co-transformations onto selective and non-selective plates for screening. Cos1 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin. Transfection of constructs was done using FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. 18 h post-transfection, cells were washed in 1× PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Where antibody staining was required, cells were permeabilized in 0.2% Nonidet-P40 (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) and incubated with mouse anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody and/or rabbit anti-MID1 polyclonal antisera and detected with anti-mouse Texas Red and/or anti-rabbit Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibodies, respectively. Antibody incubations were light-shielded at 37 °C for 2 h. Slides were mounted with Hoechst nuclear stain and antifade reagent. Staining was visualized using an Olympus AX70 light microscope with filters. The His6-tagged Bbox1-Bbox2 (B1B2; His-71—Glu-214) was cloned into the pET151d vector with a TOPO directional kit (Invitrogen) using the forward primer 5′-CAC CAT GGA CGG GCT CAA GCG CAA CGT CAC CCT ACA G-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCA CTC ACT CAA AGC TGC CAC CTG ATG ATC-3′. The His6-tagged α4 C-terminal construct was made by amplifying the DNA encoding residues Glu-236—Gly-339 using the forward primer 5′-CCA AGG TTC ATA TGG AGA GGC GTC CAG TGA AAC CCT T-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCA AGG TTA AGC TTT CAG CCC ATG TTC TGT CGG TTC CC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pSKB3 vector, a derivative of pET28, for expression as an N-terminal His6-tag fusion. DNA sequencing confirmed the orientation and integrity of all vectors before they were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. Changing leucine 146 to glutamine within the MID1 constructs was performed by a standard mutagenesis protocol. Cells expressing full-length α4 (His6-α4), the N-terminal domain (His6-α4N, residues 1–235), and the C-terminal domain (His6-α4C, residues 236–339) were grown in LB media at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 18 h at 16 °C (15.Smetana J.H.

https://openalex.org/W2063260672,"Tissue regeneration requires the activation of a set of specific growth signaling pathways. The identity of these cascades and their biological roles are known; however, the molecular mechanisms regulating the interplay between these pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we define a new role for SULFATASE 2 (SULF2) in regulating tissue regeneration and define the WNT-GLI1 axis as a novel downstream effector for this sulfatase in a liver model of tissue regeneration. SULF2 is a heparan sulfate 6-O-endosulfatase, which releases growth factors from extracellular storage sites turning active multiple signaling pathways. We demonstrate that SULF2-KO mice display delayed regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). Mechanistic analysis of the SULF2-KO phenotype showed a decrease in WNT signaling pathway activity in vivo. In isolated hepatocytes, SULF2 deficiency blocked WNT-induced β-CATENIN nuclear translocation, TCF activation, and proliferation. Furthermore, we identified the transcription factor GLI1 as a novel target of the SULF2-WNT cascade. WNT induces GLI1 expression in a SULF2- and β-CATENIN-dependent manner. GLI1-KO mice phenocopied the SULF2-KO, showing delayed regeneration and decreased hepatocyte proliferation. Moreover, we identified CYCLIN D1, a key mediator of cell growth during tissue regeneration, as a GLI1 transcriptional target. GLI1 binds to the cyclin d1 promoter and regulates its activity and expression. Finally, restoring GLI1 expression in the liver of SULF2-KO mice after PH rescues CYCLIN D1 expression and hepatocyte proliferation to wild-type levels. Thus, together these findings define a novel pathway in which SULF2 regulates tissue regeneration in part via the activation of a novel WNT-GLI1-CYCLIN D1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1982850643,"Photobacterium profundum SS9 is a Gram-negative bacterium, originally collected from the Sulu Sea. Its genome consists of two chromosomes and a 80 kb plasmid. Although it can grow under a wide range of pressures, P. profundum grows optimally at 28 MPa and 15°C. Its ability to grow at atmospheric pressure allows for both easy genetic manipulation and culture, making it a model organism to study piezophily. Here, we report a shotgun proteomic analysis of P. profundum grown at atmospheric compared to high pressure using label-free quantitation and mass spectrometry analysis. We have identified differentially expressed proteins involved in high pressure adaptation, which have been previously reported using other methods. Proteins involved in key metabolic pathways were also identified as being differentially expressed. Proteins involved in the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway were up-regulated at high pressure. Conversely, several proteins involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway were up-regulated at atmospheric pressure. Some of the proteins that were differentially identified are regulated directly in response to the physical impact of pressure. The expression of some proteins involved in nutrient transport or assimilation, are likely to be directly regulated by pressure. In a natural environment, different hydrostatic pressures represent distinct ecosystems with their own particular nutrient limitations and abundances. However, the only variable considered in this study was atmospheric pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2034734211,"Fibronectin (FN) assembly into extracellular matrix is tightly regulated and essential to embryogenesis and wound healing. FN fibrillogenesis is initiated by cytoskeleton-derived tensional forces transmitted across transmembrane integrins onto RGD binding sequences within the tenth FN type III (10FNIII) domains. These forces unfold 10FNIII to expose cryptic FN assembly sites; however, a specific sequence has not been identified in 10FNIII. Our past steered molecular dynamics simulations modeling 10FNIII unfolding by force at its RGD loop predicted a mechanical intermediate with a solvent-exposed N terminus spanning the A and B β-strands. Here, we experimentally confirm that the predicted 23-residue cryptic peptide 1 (CP1) initiates FN multimerization, which is mediated by interactions with 10FNIII that expose hydrophobic surfaces that support 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid binding. Localization of multimerization activity to the C terminus led to the discovery of a minimal 7-amino acid ""multimerization sequence"" (SLLISWD), which induces polymerization of FN and the clotting protein fibrinogen in addition to enhancing FN fibrillogenesis in fibroblasts. A point mutation at Trp-6 that reduces exposure of hydrophobic sites for 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulfonic acid binding and β-structure formation inhibits FN multimerization and prevents physiological cell-based FN assembly in culture. We propose a model for cell-mediated fibrillogenesis whereby cell traction force initiates a cascade of intermolecular exchange starting with the unfolding of 10FNIII to expose the multimerization sequence, which interacts with strand B of another 10FNIII domain via a Trp-mediated β-strand exchange to stabilize a partially unfolded intermediate that propagates FN self-assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2003508614,"Background The glycan-targeting C-type DC-SIGN lectin receptor is implicated in the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by binding the virus and transferring the captured HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. Carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs) have been reported to block HIV-1 infection. We have now investigated the potent mannose-specific anti-HIV CBA griffithsin (GRFT) on its ability to inhibit the capture of HIV-1 to DC-SIGN, its DC-SIGN-directed transmission to CD4+ T-lymphocytes and the role of the three carbohydrate-binding sites (CBS) of GRFT in these processes. Findings GRFT inhibited HIV-1(IIIB) infection of CEM and HIV-1(NL4.3) infection of C8166 CD4+ T-lymphocytes at an EC50 of 0.059 and 0.444 nM, respectively. The single mutant CBS variants of GRFT (in which a key Asp in one of the CBS was mutated to Ala) were about ∼20 to 60-fold less potent to prevent HIV-1 infection and ∼20 to 90-fold less potent to inhibit syncytia formation in co-cultures of persistently HIV-1 infected HuT-78 and uninfected C8166 CD4+ T-lymphocytes. GRFT prevents DC-SIGN-mediated virus capture and HIV-1 transmission to CD4+ T-lymphocytes at an EC50 of 1.5 nM and 0.012 nM, respectively. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies revealed that wild-type GRFT efficiently blocked the binding between DC-SIGN and immobilized gp120, whereas the point mutant CBS variants of GRFT were ∼10- to 15-fold less efficient. SPR-analysis also demonstrated that wild-type GRFT and its single mutant CBS variants have the capacity to expel bound gp120 from the gp120-DC-SIGN complex in a dose dependent manner, a property that was not observed for HHA, another mannose-specific potent anti-HIV-1 CBA. Conclusion GRFT is inhibitory against HIV gp120 binding to DC-SIGN, efficiently prevents DC-SIGN-mediated transfer of HIV-1 to CD4+ T-lymphocytes and is able to expel gp120 from the gp120-DC-SIGN complex. Functionally intact CBS of GRFT are important for the optimal action of GRFT."

The dynamic nature of bone involves an interplay between bone formation (osteogenesis) and born resorption (osteolysis). It is through constant bone remodeling that vertebrates are able to maintain constant bone mass in disease-free states. The tightly regulated balance of remodeling of bone involves osteoblasts that form new bone and osteoclasts that remove bone. Osteoclast ontogeny and the mechanisms that regulate bone resorption have been studied intensely (1.Asagiri M. Takayanagi H. The molecular understanding of osteoclast differentiation.Bone. 2007; 40: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 2.Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation.Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar), with much of the therapeutic treatments for bone-wasting disorders targeted toward osteoclasts (3.Edwards J.R. Weivoda M.M. Osteoclasts. Malefactors of disease and targets for treatment.Discov. Med. 2012; 13: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). In light of the capability to target bone resorption mechanisms, there has been a more recent movement toward understanding how the osteoblastic differentiation mechanism can be targeted to enhance bone formation (4.Canalis E.

Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that control osteoblast differentiation is paramount to identify therapeutic targets in bone wasting disorders. Mature osteoblasts originate from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that are induced to differentiate toward an osteoblastic lineage by various factors. The canonical Wnt signaling plays a major role in osteoblast differentiation (6.Lin G.L. Hankenson K.D. Integration of BMP, Wnt, and notch signaling pathways in osteoblast differentiation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), with a pool of soluble and highly unstable β-catenin transducing the Wnt signal in this pathway (7.Davis E.K. Zou Y. Ghosh A. Wnts acting through canonical and noncanonical signaling pathways exert opposite effects on hippocampal synapse formation.Neural Dev. 2008; 3: 32Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The signaling pathway is initiated by the ligation of the Wnt ligand to the Frizzled and LDL receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) coreceptors, which initiates a signaling cascade that leads to an intracellular accumulation and nuclear recruitment of β-catenin (8.MacDonald B.T. Tamai K. He X. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt ligands, cytoplasmic β-catenin is recruited into a destruction complex, which induces β-catenin phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Within the canonical pathway, Wnt stimulation promotes dissociation of the destruction complex, inhibits β-catenin degradation, and promotes the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and subsequent interaction with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) 4The abbreviations used are: TCFT-cell factorLEFlymphoid enhancer factorMTmicrotubuleAPCadenomatous polyposis coliGSK-3βglycogen synthase kinase 3βAAascorbic acidIPimmunoprecipitationALPalkaline phosphatase. to initiate transcription of target genes (6.Lin G.L.

Integration of BMP, Wnt, and notch signaling pathways in osteoblast differentiation.J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The presence of a TCF regulatory element on the Runx2 promoter indicates that the canonical Wnt signaling pathway directly regulates Runx2 gene expression in pluripotent mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor cells via the recruitment of β-catenin to the Runx2 gene and thus contributes to osteoblast maturation (13.Gaur T.

Runx2 knock-out mice have a severe defect in intramembranous and endochondral ossification (14.Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M.

Cbfa1, a candidate gene for cleidocranial dysplasia syndrome, is essential for osteoblast differentiation and bone development.Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). RUNX2 is expressed in early stages and throughout osteoblast differentiation and has been shown to bind to and regulate the expression of many osteoblast genes, with RUNX2 binding regions present in the promoter regions of osteocalcin, collagen, and bone sialoprotein genes (16.Ducy P.

A transcriptional activator of osteoblast differentiation.Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ectopic expression of RUNX2 in fibroblasts that are not committed to the osteoblast lineage induces the gene expression of the osteoblast-specific markers, including collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin (16.Ducy P.

Aside from the role of β-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway, β-catenin also has a secondary function at sites of cell-cell contacts at adherens junctions. The transmembrane cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, is a major component of adherens junctions in epithelial and other cell types (17.Boller K. Vestweber D. Kemler R.

The binding of β-catenin to type I cadherins renders a stable pool of membrane-bound β-catenin that regulates and stabilizes these cell-cell contacts (20.Nelson W.J. Nusse R.

High resolution analysis has allowed understanding of the elaborate cell adhesion complex that includes cadherins, catenins, and the F-actin network (22.Ishiyama N. Ikura M. The three-dimensional structure of the cadherin-catenin complex.Subcell. Biochem. 2012; 60: 39-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Adherens junctions also have a microtubule (MT) component, wherein dynamic MTs recruit and control the regional distribution of cadherins at cell-cell contacts (23.Stehbens S.J. Paterson A.D.

The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein, which is also an MT plus-end protein, stabilizes complexes with the axin scaffolding protein and the two kinases, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and casein kinase 1α, to form the destruction complex and regulate β-catenin protein levels (32.Brocardo M. Henderson B.R. APC shuttling to the membrane, nucleus and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).

Given the importance of the Wnt signaling cascade in osteoblast differentiation, in the present study, we identify how osteoblast differentiation is influenced by cytoskeletal elements, namely EB1, the MT plus-end-binding protein. We utilized the MC3T3-E1 mouse preosteoblast cell line to allow molecular manipulation of EB1 protein levels. We show that EB1 is significantly up-regulated in ascorbic acid (AA)-stimulated osteoblasts and that EB1 knockdown significantly impairs the osteoblast differentiation program. Through cell biology analysis, we determine that EB1 interacts with and influences the stability of β-catenin and identify EB1 as an important regulator of cell-cell adhesion-induced osteoblast differentiation.

MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 was acquired from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). The MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell line was routinely cultured in α-minimal essential medium without AA, supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For all experiments, osteoblasts grown to 80% confluence were passed using 0.05% trypsin and then plated onto 6-well plates (Starstedt Inc.) with 25-mm glass coverslips for immunofluorescent studies. For Western blotting and RNA extraction, cells were grown in 6-well plates without coverslips. For differentiation, osteoblasts were stimulated with AA (50 μg/ml) or 100 ng/ml rhBMP-2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), over a 5-day period, with medium and AA being replenished every second day. For primary cell analysis, cells were isolated from postnatal day 0 C57BL/6J mouse calvaria using a modification of a method described previously (38.Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N. Merrilees M.J. Sodek J.

For plasmid transfection, osteoblasts were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For comparative experiments between low and high density growth, cells were plated at 10,000 and 100,000 cells/ml, respectively, and treated with AA for 5 days. For experiments involving E-cadherin-blocking antibody, cells were treated with isotype control IgG or a blocking antibody against E-cadherin (20 μg/ml) at days 2 and 4 during a 5-day stimulation with AA.

MC3T3-E1 cells treated with AA for 2 days were transfected with Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions using MISSION siRNA (SASI_Mm02_00312684, Sigma-Aldrich) directed against EB1 at a concentration of 20 μm for 72 h in addition to treatment with AA. Control cells were transfected with a MISSION® siRNA universal negative (scrambled) control (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein levels of siRNA-treated cells were analyzed by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and quantitative PCR 3 days after transfection. All expression constructs were created with standard PCR-based cloning strategies. Total RNA was isolated from cultured MC3T3-E1 cells using the RNeasy minikit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The cDNA sequences of full-length EB1 and β-catenin were amplified with Superscript One-Step RT-PCR with a platinum Taq kit using the following primer pairs: EB1-F, 5′-aatgctagcaccatggcagtgaat-3′; EB1-R, 5′-attgaattcgatactcttcttgttcctc-3′; β-catenin-F, 5′-aagctagcaccatggctactcaagctgacc-3′; β-catenin-R, 5′-aagctagcaccatggctactcaagctgacc-3′. The resulting PCR products were cloned in frame to pRetroQ-mcherry-N1 and peGFP-N1 vectors, respectively, using NheI and EcoRI restriction sites for EB1 and NheI and BamHI for β-catenin. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed following a time course of ascorbic acid stimulation, in addition to measuring differences in mRNA levels of cells grown in low or high density environments. For quantitative RT-PCR, total mRNA from MC3T3-E1 cells grown in 6-well plates was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The purity and quantity of RNA were confirmed by a NanoDrop® ND-100 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA in 50-μl reaction mixtures, using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for quantitative RT-PCR from Invitrogen. A control cDNA serial dilution series of known concentration was constructed for each gene to establish a standard curve.

Large randomized clinical trials remain the ultimate means of validating therapeutic efficacy, but they require large cohorts of patients and are lengthy and costly. A useful approach is to conduct a window of opportunity study in which patients are exposed to a drug pre-surgically during the interval between the core needle biopsy and the definitive surgery. These are non-therapeutic studies and the end point is not clinical or pathological response but rather evaluation of molecular changes in the tumor specimens that can predict response. However, since the end points of the non-therapeutic studies are biologic, it is critical to first define the biologic changes that occur in the absence of treatment. In this study, we compared the molecular profiles of breast cancer tumors at the time of the diagnostic biopsy versus the definitive surgery in the absence of any intervention using the Nanostring nCounter platform. We found that while the majority of the transcripts did not vary between the two biopsies, there was evidence of activation of immune related genes in response to the first biopsy and further investigations of the immune changes after a biopsy in early breast cancer seem warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2158104236,"The Dictyostelium discoideum genome encodes five proteins that share weak sequence similarity with vertebrate P2X receptors. Unlike vertebrate P2X receptors, these proteins are not expressed on the surface of cells, but populate the tubules and bladders of the contractile vacuole. In this study, we expressed humanized cDNAs of P2XA, P2XB, P2XC, P2XD, and P2XE in human embryonic kidney cells and altered the ionic and proton environment in an attempt to reflect the situation in amoeba. Recording of whole-cell membrane currents showed that four receptors operated as ATP-gated channels (P2XA, P2XB, P2XD, and P2XE). At P2XA receptors, ATP was the only effective agonist of 17 structurally related putative ligands that were tested. Extracellular sodium, compared with potassium, strongly inhibited ATP responses in P2XB, P2XD, and P2XE receptors. Increasing the proton concentration (pH 6.2) accelerated desensitization at P2XA receptors and decreased currents at P2XD receptors, but increased the currents at P2XB and P2XE receptors. Dictyostelium lacking P2XA receptors showed impaired regulatory volume decrease in hypotonic solution. This phenotype was readily rescued by overexpression of P2XA and P2XD receptors, partially rescued by P2XB and P2XE receptors, and not rescued by P2XC receptors. The failure of the nonfunctional receptor P2XC to restore the regulatory volume decrease highlights the importance of ATP activation of P2X receptors for a normal response to hypo-osmotic shock, and the weak rescue by P2XB and P2XE receptors indicates that there is limited functional redundancy among Dictyostelium P2X receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2113135987,"P2X receptor subtypes can be distinguished by their sensitivity to ATP analogues and selective antagonists. We have used chimeras between human P2X1 and P2X2 receptors to address the contribution of the extracellular ligand binding loop, transmembrane segments (TM1 and TM2), and intracellular amino and carboxyl termini to the action of partial agonists (higher potency and efficacy of BzATP and Ap5A at P2X1 receptors) and antagonists. Sensitivity to the antagonists NF449, suramin, and PPADS was conferred by the nature of the extracellular loop (e.g. nanomolar for NF449 at P2X1 and P2X2-1EXT and micromolar at P2X2 and P2X1-2EXT). In contrast, the effectiveness of partial agonists was similar to P2X1 levels for both of the loop transfers, suggesting that interactions with the rest of the receptor played an important role. Swapping TM2 had reciprocal effects on partial agonist efficacy. However, TM1 swaps increased partial agonist efficacy at both chimeras, and this was similar for swaps of both TM1 and 2. Changing the amino terminus had no effect on agonist potency but increased partial agonist efficacy at P2X2-1N and decreased it at P2X1-2N chimeras, demonstrating that potency and efficacy can be independently regulated. Chimeras and point mutations also identified residues in the carboxyl terminus that regulated recovery from channel desensitization. These results show that interactions among the intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular portions of the receptor regulate channel properties and suggest that transitions to channel opening, the behavior of the open channel, and recovery from the desensitized state can be controlled independently.Background: P2X receptor subtypes show differences in pharmacology.Results: Chimeric P2X receptors exhibit modified partial agonist action and recovery from desensitization.Conclusion: Interactions among the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular regions regulate channel properties.Significance: Agonist binding and transitions to channel opening (efficacy), behavior of the open channel, as well as recovery from desensitization can be controlled independently.

P2X receptors comprise a family of ATP-gated cation channels. The seven mammalian P2X receptor subunits (P2X1–7) have two transmembrane segments, intracellular amino and carboxyl termini, with a large extracellular ATP binding loop (1.North R.A. Molecular physiology of P2X receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). P2X receptor subunits can assemble as homo- and heterotrimers, and 13 distinct recombinant receptor phenotypes have been described (2.Coddou C. Yan Z. Obsil T. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Stojilkovic S.S. Activation and regulation of purinergic P2X receptor channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2011; 63: 641-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). At least one P2X receptor subtype is expressed by almost every cell type at some point during development. This widespread distribution of P2X receptors, and the variety of ways that extracellular levels of ATP can be increased e.g. in response to neuronal activity, mechanical stimulation/shear stress and tissue damage, result in P2X receptors making significant contributions to a range of physiological and pathophysiological conditions including muscle contraction, bone remodeling, and pain sensation (for review see Ref. 3.Burnstock G.

A core ATP binding pocket consists of residues that are conserved throughout the P2X receptor family that co-ordinate the binding of the phosphate tail and adenine ring (4.Hattori M. Gouaux E. Molecular mechanism of ATP binding and ion channel activation in P2X receptors.Nature. 2012; 485: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These interactions have been proposed to contribute to the selectivity of the receptor for ATP over CTP, GTP, and UTP (4.Hattori M. Gouaux E.

Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). For example α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP) 2The abbreviations used are: α,β-meATPα,β-methylene ATPAp5AP1,P5-diadenosine 5′-pentaphosphateBzATP2′,3′-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATPEXTextracellular loopPPADSpyridoxal-phosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonateTM1first transmembraneTM2second transmembrane. is equipotent with ATP at the human P2X1 receptor and has high efficacy, whereas at P2X2 receptors α,β-meATP is >100-fold less potent than ATP and has low efficacy (9.Evans R.J.

A chimera with the P2X2 receptor extracellular loop on a P2X1 receptor background or replacing either the first or second transmembrane segments of P2X2 with that from the P2X1 receptor increased agonist sensitivity to both ATP and α,β-meATP (10.Haines W.R.

However, whether the swaps of these regions had effects on other partial agonists, reciprocal effects in a mirror chimera, or the contribution of the intracellular regions of the receptor to regulating partial agonist efficacy were not determined. A naturally occurring rat and mouse P2X7 receptor splice variant (P2X7k) has an alternative amino terminus and part of the first transmembrane (TM1) segment. The P2X7k receptor has increased sensitivity to agonists (11.Nicke A. Kuan Y.H. Masin M. Rettinger J. Marquez-Klaka B. Bender O. Górecki D.C. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Soto F.

A key signature feature of P2X receptor subtypes is their time course. For example, P2X1 receptors show rapid transient responses that decay rapidly during continued ATP application (14.Valera S.

Recovery from the desensitized state takes several minutes, and agonist unbinding from the desensitized receptor contributes to recovery at P2X1 and P2X3 receptors (20.Rettinger J. Schmalzing G.

However, less is known about which parts of the receptor are associated with recovery from the desensitized state following ATP removal. We have recently generated a series of reciprocal chimeras between the human P2X1 and P2X2 receptors and demonstrated the important role of the pre-TM1 region in regulation of receptor time course (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study we have used these chimeras to determine the contribution of the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular segments to partial agonist action and recovery from desensitization. Chimeras were generated by mega-primer-mediated domain swapping as reported previously (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to chimeras, point mutants were made using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Production of the correct mutations and absence of coding errors was verified by DNA sequencing Automated ABI Sequencing Service, University of Leicester. X. laevis oocytes were injected with transcribed sense strand cRNA (mMessage mMachine; Ambion) as described previously (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing WT P2X receptors were stored at 17 °C in ND96 buffer (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) for 3–7 days. For electrophysiological recordings the 1.8 mm CaCl2 was replaced with 1.8 mm BaCl2. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out in response to U-tube application (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) of agonists (all from Sigma). The effectiveness of partial agonists was calculated as a percentage of the maximum ATP response (100 μm). Prior to application of partial agonists, reproducible ATP responses were established (time between applications ranged from 3 min for WT P2X2 receptors, increasing to a maximum of 20 min for those chimeras/point mutants showing slow recovery from desensitization). Concentration-response curves for partial agonists were normalized to the maximum ATP response at that receptor and fitted with the Hill equation (Equation 1), Y=XnHM/(XnH+EC50nH)(Eq.1) where Y is response, X is agonist concentration, nH is the Hill coefficient, M is the maximum response of the partial agonist expressed as a percentage of maximum response to ATP, and EC50 is the concentration of the agonist evoking 50% of the maximum response for that agonist. The pEC50 is given as −log10EC50 concentration. In the figures, concentration-response curves are fitted to the mean normalized data. Antagonists were bath perfused for 5 min before being co-applied with an EC90 concentration of ATP. Inhibition curves were fitted with Equation 2, Y=100/(1+10(log|C50−X)nH)(Eq.2) where Y is % of control response, IC50 is the concentration of antagonist inhibiting the agonist control response by 50%, X is the log of the antagonist concentration, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Desensitization of chimeric receptors and P2X receptor point mutants was assessed as described previously (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Currents that decayed by 50% within a 20-s application of maximal ATP (100 μm) are described by “time to 50% decay ” (in seconds). For currents that did not decay by 50% during 20-s agonist application, percentage peak current remaining at the end of the 20-s application is given. For rapidly desensitizing responses “time to 50% recovery ” from desensitization was determined. To do this, reproducible currents to ATP (100 μm) were recorded (variable recovery times for reproducible maximum currents ranging from 3 to 20 min). ATP applications were then made at shorter time intervals in between reproducible recordings to determine time to 50% recovery from desensitization. Data are presented as mean ± S.E., and any differences between the means was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test or Student's t test as appropriate. n refers to the number of oocytes tested. At hP2X1 receptors, ATP (100 μm, a maximal concentration) evoked inward currents that desensitized during the continued presence of agonist (Fig. 1). The analogues α,β-meATP, Ap5A, and BzATP were partial agonists with maximal efficacies at 100 μm of 80 ± 6, 46 ± 7, and 47 ± 5% of the maximum response to ATP, respectively (Fig. 1) similar to that reported previously (22.Allsopp R.C. El Ajouz S. Schmid R. Evans R.J. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis (residues Glu52-Gly96) of the human P2X1 receptor for ATP: mapping agonist binding and channel gating.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29207-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, at the hP2X2 receptor, ATP was ∼13-fold less potent, and the analogues were significantly less effective (12 ± 3, 8 ± 2, and 9 ± 2% maximum response to ATP for α,β-meATP, Ap5A, and BzATP, respectively, and EC50 values of >100 μm, Fig. 1). The structure of the ATP-bound zfP2X4 receptor showed the core residues that make the ATP binding site, and these are conserved throughout the P2X receptor family (4.Hattori M. Gouaux E. Molecular mechanism of ATP binding and ion channel activation in P2X receptors.Nature. 2012; 485: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, what determines the differences in ATP sensitivity and partial agonist action among receptor subtypes? Is it variations in the extracellular domain and/or changes in gating mediated by other parts of the receptor? To address this question we have characterized the action of ATP and the partial agonists at chimeras swapping the extracellular region of human P2X1 and P2X2 receptors. At the chimeric receptor replacing the extracellular loop of the P2X1 receptor with that from the P2X2 receptor (P2X1-2EXT) ATP evoked currents of time course and sensitivity similar to those of the WT hP2X1 receptor (pEC50 6.5 ± 0.1 and 6.3 ± 0.1 for P2X1-2EXT and WT hP2X1 receptor, respectively (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). The efficacy of α,β-meATP at the P2X1-2EXT receptor (66 ± 8% of maximal response to ATP) was the same as the WT P2X1 receptors (80 ± 6%). However, the effectiveness of Ap5A and BzATP was increased to 74 ± 6 and 72 ± 5 of the maximal response to ATP (p < 0.05 for both). The pEC50 values for these partial agonists were 5.2 ± 0.1, 5.8 ± 0.1, and 5.7 ± 0.1 for α,β-meATP, Ap5A, and BzATP, respectively (compared with the <4 estimate at the P2X2 receptor) (Fig. 1). The finding that the properties of the P2X1-2EXT chimera are more similar to the P2X1 than the P2X2 receptor indicates that residues required for agonist recognition are present for both P2X1 and P2X2 receptors, as suggested previously for α,β-meATP (23.Jiang L.H. Rassendren F. Spelta V. Surprenant A. North R.A. Amino acid residues involved in gating identified in the first membrane-spanning domain of the rat P2X(2) receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This suggests that interactions of the loop with the rest of the receptor make a significant contribution to the differences in agonist sensitivity and efficacy. When the P2X2 receptor loop was replaced with that from the P2X1 receptor the ATP potency was intermediate between the P2X1 and P2X2 receptors (decreased ∼3-fold compared with P2X1 and increased ∼5-fold compared with the WT P2X2 receptor, p < 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively). α,β-meATP sensitivity was also reduced at P2X2-1EXT compared with the P2X1 receptor (pEC50 values of 4.8 ± 0.2 and 5.7 ± 0.1, respectively, p < 0.01), but efficacy was unaffected. BzATP efficacy was increased by ∼10% for P2X2-1EXT compared with the P2X1 WT (p < 0.05), but this did not result in a change in sensitivity (pEC50 values of 6.5 ± 0.2 and 6.2 ± 0.2, respectively). The effectiveness of Ap5A was the same for P2X1 and P2X2-1EXT receptors as was the sensitivity to the agonist (pEC50 value 6.3 ± 0.2 and 5.9 ± 0.1, respectively). These findings with the P2X2-1EXT chimera suggest that agonist binding to the P2X1 receptor extracellular loop is more efficient at activating the transmembrane and intracellular parts of the P2X2 receptor than the P2X2 receptor loop. Taken together with the P2X1-2EXT chimera properties these results suggest that interactions of the extracellular loop with the rest of the receptor play an important role in regulating agonist sensitivity and efficacy. The P2X1 and P2X2 receptors show differences in sensitivity to the antagonists suramin, NF449, and PPADS (measured against a standardized EC90 concentration of ATP; 1 μm at P2X1 and 100 μm at P2X2 receptors). Suramin was ∼100-fold more effective at hP2X1 than hP2X2 receptors (IC50 of ∼1 and 100 μm for P2X1 and P2X2, respectively, Fig. 2, a, and b). For the chimeras, the suramin sensitivity was determined by the nature of the extracellular loop with ∼50% inhibition of ATP response by 1 μm suramin at P2X2-1EXT receptors and ∼100 μm suramin at the P2X1-2EXT chimera (Fig. 2, a and b). The suramin derivative NF449 is a selective antagonist at P2X1 receptors (24.Hülsmann M. Nickel P. Kassack M. Schmalzing G. Lambrecht G. Markwardt F. NF449, a novel picomolar potency antagonist at human P2X1 receptors.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 470: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and we have shown previously an ∼1,500-fold difference in sensitivity between hP2X1 and hP2X2 receptors (25.El-Ajouz S. Ray D. Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. Molecular basis of selective antagonism of the P2X1 receptor for ATP by NF449 and suramin: contribution of basic amino acids in the cysteine-rich loop.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Replacing the extracellular loop of the P2X1 receptor with that from P2X2 (P2X1-2EXT) produced a receptor that had low sensitivity to NF449 (pIC50 5.8 ± 0.1). In the reciprocal chimera (P2X2-1EXT) NF449 had a pIC50 of 8.4 ± 0.2 similar to that of the WT P2X1 receptor (Fig. 2, c and d). There is a modest difference in PPADS sensitivity between hP2X1 and hP2X2 receptors. PPADS (1 μm) was ∼2-fold more effective in inhibiting responses at hP2X2 compared with hP2X1 receptors (77.6 ± 5.3 and 38.8 ± 4.1% inhibition of a standardized EC90 concentration of ATP for hP2X1 and hP2X2, respectively). This difference in inhibition was associated with the extracellular loop as when the loop of P2X1 receptor was replaced with that from P2X2 (P2X1-2EXT) the level of inhibition by PPADS (1 μm) was equivalent of that for the P2X2 receptor, and the converse was found for the reciprocal P2X2-1EXT chimera (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that differences in sensitivity to the antagonists suramin, NF449, and PPADS arise from variations in the extracellular ligand binding region. These data also suggest that these chimeras do not result in major conformational changes in the extracellular region of the receptor because if this were the case we would not expect there to be such reciprocal changes in antagonist sensitivity for the chimeras. The extracellular loop swap chimeras showed that the transmembrane segments and/or the intracellular regions could also have important roles in regulating partial agonist action. We have previously characterized the ATP sensitivity of the chimeras (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) but have not determined whether the chimeras have any effect on partial agonist action. To determine the contribution of the intracellular and transmembrane regions to partial agonist action we focused on Ap5A and BzATP because our previous work on P2X1 receptor mutants has shown that these are more sensitive to changes in agonist action than α,β-meATP (22.Allsopp R.C. El Ajouz S. Schmid R. Evans R.J. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis (residues Glu52-Gly96) of the human P2X1 receptor for ATP: mapping agonist binding and channel gating.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 29207-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that α,β-meATP action was increased at the chimeric rat P2X2-1TM1 receptor (10.Haines W.R. Migita K. Cox J.A. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. The first transmembrane domain of the P2X receptor subunit participates in the agonist-induced gating of the channel.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32793-32798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, the effects of other partial agonists or at the reciprocal chimera were not tested. In this study we see similar increases in effectiveness of the partial agonists Ap5A and BzATP (100 μm) at the hP2X2-TM1 chimeric receptor (to 70 ± 3.8 and 75 ± 5.6% maximal response to ATP respectively, Fig. 4), and this was associated with an increase in potency (pEC50 values to 4.6 ± 0.1 and 5.6 ± 0.1, respectively, compared with <4 for P2X2 WT, n = 3–8). The effectiveness of Ap5A and BzATP was also increased by ∼ 30% at the P2X1-2TM1 chimera (compared with P2X1 alone) (Fig. 4). However, this was not associated with a change in partial agonist sensitivity (pEC50 values Ap5A 6.3 ± 0.2, 6.2 ± 0.2, and BzATP 6.5 ± 0.2, 6.3 ± 0.2 for P2X1 WT and P2X1-2TM1 respectively, n = 3). This suggests that it is not the TM1 per se but its interactions with the rest of the receptor that are important for determining the effectiveness of partial agonists. The second transmembrane segment (TM2) lines the ionic pore of the P2X receptor (4.Hattori M. Gouaux E. Molecular mechanism of ATP binding and ion channel activation in P2X receptors.Nature. 2012; 485: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 5.Kawate T. Michel J.C. Birdsong W.T. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of the ATP-gated P2X(4) ion channel in the closed state.Nature. 2009; 460: 592-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Mutations in this region have been shown to affect gating/spontaneous openings (26.Cao L. Young M.T. Broomhead H.E. Fountain S.J. North R.A. Thr339-to-serine substitution in rat P2X2 receptor second transmembrane domain causes constitutive opening and indicates a gating role for Lys308.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 12916-12923Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) so may play a role in the gating efficiency of partial agonists. Replacing TM2 of the P2X1 receptor with that from the P2X2 receptor (P2X1-2TM2) reduced partial agonist effectiveness to levels similar to the P2X2 receptor (Fig. 4), and so potency could not be estimated. We have shown previously that this chimera has no effect on ATP sensitivity (19.Allsopp R.C. Evans R.J. The intracellular amino terminus plays a dominant role in desensitization of ATP-gated P2X receptor ion channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 44691-44701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The chimera on the P2X2 receptor background (P2X2-1TM2) showed increased responses to the partial agonists to levels intermediate between P2X1 and P2X2 receptors. This was accompanied by an increase in sensitivity to ATP and the partial agonists (pEC50 values for ATP 5.7 ± 0.1, 5.2 ± 0.1, p < 0.001, Ap5A 4.2 ± 0.3, <4 estimate and BzATP 5.3 ± 0.1, <4 estimate for P2X2-1TM2 and P2X2 WT, respectively, n = 3–8). The reciprocal effects of TM2 swaps on partial agonist efficacy suggest a contribution of this region to partial agonist action. When both transmembrane segments were replaced (P2X1-2TM1 + 2 and P2X2-1TM1 + 2) the efficacy of the partial agonists was equivalent to or slightly increased compared with WT P2X1 receptors ("
https://openalex.org/W2143897773,"Micafungin is a non-reversible inhibitor of 1, 3-β-D-glucan synthase and interferes with fungal cell wall synthesis. Clinically, micafungin has been shown to be efficacious for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis. However, considering its relatively restricted antifungal spectrum, combination therapy with micafungin plus other agents should be considered in critically ill patients. To identify potential therapeutic targets for syncretic drug combinations that potentiate micafungin action, we carried out a genome-wide screen for altered sensitivity to micafungin by using the model yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutant library. We confirmed that 159 deletion strains in the library are micafungin sensitive and classified them into various functional categories, including cell wall biosynthesis, gene expression and chromatin remodeling, membrane trafficking, signaling transduction, ubiquitination, ergosterol biosynthetic process and a variety of other known functions or still unknown functions. On the other hand, we also investigated the growth inhibitory activities of some well-known drugs in combination with micafungin including antifungal drug amphotericin B, fluconazole and immunosuppressive drug FK506. We found that amphotericin B in combination with micafungin showed a more potent inhibitory activity against wild-type cells than that of micafungin alone, whereas fluconazole in combination with micafungin did not. Also, the immunosuppressive drug FK506 showed synergistic inhibitory effect with micafungin on the growth of wild-type cells, whereas it decreased the inhibitory effect of micafungin in Δpmk1 cells, a deletion mutant of the cell wall integrity mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Pmk1. Altogether, our findings provide useful information for new potential drug combinations in the treatment of fungal infections."

Here we investigated the phenotypic and transcriptional differences between the wild type strain Xuzhou21 and the pO157_Sal cured mutant strain Xuzhou21m. RNA-Seq analysis found that all 52 ORFs encoded on pO157_Sal were transcribed. One hundred and sixty eight chromosomal and pO157 genes were differentially expressed (≥2 fold difference) between Xuzhou21 and Xuzhou21m. Sixty-seven and 101 genes were up-regulated and down-regulated respectively by pO157_Sal including genes related to stress response, adaption and virulence. The plasmid-cured mutant Xuzhou21m grew slower than wild type Xuzhou21 and pO157_Sal plasmid complemented strain Xuzhou21c in M9 medium under the condition of high NaCl or presence of sodium deoxycholate (NaDC), corroborating with the RNA-Seq data. Seven differentially expressed genes are associated with NaDC resistance, including the adenine-specific DNA-methyltransferase gene (dam), multidrug efflux system subunit gene mdtA, hyperosmotically inducible periplasmic protein gene osmY and oxidation-reduction related genes while two differentially expressed genes (osmY and pspD) are likely to be related to resistance to osmotic pressure. A number of differentially expressed genes were virulence associated including four genes encoding T3SS effectors from the chromosome and ehxD from pO157. Through complementation of Xuzhou21m with a plasmid construct carrying the pO157_Sal hha homolog we further showed that the pO157_Sal hha represses the expression of T3SS effectors. These findings demonstrated that the plasmid pO157_Sal affects the transcription of the chromosomal and pO157 plasmid genes and contributes to the enhanced ability to resist stress. We conclude that pO157_Sal plays an important role in regulating global gene expression and affects the virulence and adaptation of E. coli O157:H7."

We hypothesized that undernutrition during gestation would affect offspring sleep architecture and/or homeostasis. Pregnant female mice were assigned to either control (fed ad libitum; AD) or 50% dietary restriction (DR) groups from gestation day 12 to parturition. After parturition, dams were fed AD chow. After weaning, the pups were also fed AD into adulthood. At adulthood (aged 8-9 weeks), we carried out sleep recordings. Although offspring mice displayed a significantly reduced body weight at birth, their weights recovered three days after birth. Enhancement of electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was observed in the DR mice over a 24-hour period without changing the diurnal pattern or amounts of wake, NREM, or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In addition, DR mice also displayed an enhancement of EEG-SWA rebound after a 6-hour sleep deprivation and a higher threshold for waking in the face of external stimuli. DR adult offspring mice exhibited small but significant increases in the expression of hypothalamic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Pparα) and brain-specific carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1c) mRNA, two genes involved in lipid metabolism. Undernutrition during pregnancy may influence sleep homeostasis, with offspring exhibiting greater sleep pressure."

The plate moves either in assisting or opposing direction to the free stream. The plate and free stream velocities are considered to be proportional to whilst the magnetic field and mass transfer velocity are taken to be proportional to where is the distance along the plate from the leading edge of the plate. Instead of using existing similarity transformations, we use a linear group of transformations to transform the governing equations into similarity equations with relevant boundary conditions. Numerical solutions of the similarity equations are presented to show the effects of the controlling parameters on the dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration profiles as well as on the friction factor, rate of heat and mass transfer. It is found that the rate of heat transfer elevates with the mass transfer velocity, convective heat transfer, Prandtl number, velocity ratio and the magnetic field parameters. It is also found that the rate of mass transfer enhances with the mass transfer velocity, velocity ratio, power law index and the Schmidt number, whilst it suppresses with the magnetic field parameter. Our results are compared with the results existing in the open literature. The comparisons are satisfactory."
https://openalex.org/W2053153099,"The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit complex that carries out ATP-driven proton transport. It is composed of a peripheral V1 domain that hydrolyzes ATP and an integral V0 domain that translocates protons. Subunit a is a 100-kDa integral membrane protein (part of V0) that possesses an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain. Although the C-terminal domain functions in proton transport, the N-terminal domain is critical for intracellular targeting and regulation of V-ATPase assembly. Despite its importance, there is currently no high resolution structure for subunit a of the V-ATPase. Recently, the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the related subunit I from the archaebacterium Meiothermus ruber was reported. We have used homology modeling to construct a model of the N-terminal domain of Vph1p, one of two isoforms of subunit a expressed in yeast. To test this model, unique cysteine residues were introduced into a Cys-less form of Vph1p and their accessibility to modification by the sulfhydryl reagent 3-(N-maleimido-propionyl) biocytin (MPB) was determined. In addition, accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to MPB modification was compared in the V1V0 complex and the free V0 domain to identify residues protected from modification by the presence of V1. The results provide an experimental test of the proposed model and have identified regions of the N-terminal domain of subunit a that likely serve as interfacial contact sites with the peripheral V1 domain. The possible significance of these results for in vivo regulation of V-ATPase assembly is discussed."
