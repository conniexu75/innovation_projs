https://openalex.org/W1525659758,"We have studied the conformation of tau protein and Alzheimer paired helical filaments (PHF) by several spectroscopic, scattering, and imaging methods revealing the overall shape and the conformation of the polypeptide backbone. Tau protein behaves in solution as if it were denatured; no evidence for compact folding was detected. The protein is highly extended, there is no defined radius of gyration, and the scattering is best described by that of a random (Gaussian) polymer. CD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy show only a minimal content of ordered secondary structure (alpha-helix or beta-sheet). Similarly, PHFs from Alzheimer brain tissue show no detectable secondary structure by x-ray diffraction or spectroscopy. It is thus unlikely that the aggregation of tau into Alzheimer PHFs is based on interactions between strands of beta-sheets (a model currently favored for other disease-related polymers such as beta-amyloid fibers of Alzheimer's disease)."
https://openalex.org/W1518760783,"Mineralocorticoids have been suggested to act on blood vessels, leading to increased vasoreactivity and peripheral resistance. However, the site of their production has so far been believed to be only the adrenal cortex. Here, we show direct evidence that vascular cells per se are aldosteronogenic, possessing their own system that responds to the steroid. Using polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription, the CYP11B2 mRNA encoding the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of aldosterone was detected in both endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells cultivated from human pulmonary artery. The aldosterone receptor (type 1 mineralocorticoid receptor) gene was also found to be expressed in smooth muscle cells and, to a lesser extent, in endothelial cells. CYP11B2 gene expression in smooth muscle cells was stimulated by angiotensin II, the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, the angiotensin II-induced increase in [3H]leucine incorporation in smooth muscle cells was significantly enhanced by aldosterone but inhibited by ZK 91587, a type 1 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. This may indicate that vascular aldosterone participates in the angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. The present study therefore provides the starting point for a novel understanding of the molecular basis of vascular remodeling and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1554460966,"Endothelial cell-derived oxygen free radicals are important mediators of postischemic injury; however, the mechanisms that trigger this radical generation are not known, and it is not known if this process can occur in human cells and tissues. The enzyme xanthine oxidase can be an important source of radical generation; however, it has been reported that this enzyme may not be present in human endothelium. To determine the presence and mechanisms of radical generation in human vascular endothelial cells subjected to anoxia and reoxygenation, electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were performed on cultured human aortic endothelial cells using the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). These measurements were correlated with cellular injury, xanthine oxidase activity, and alterations in cellular nucleotides. Upon reoxygenation after 60 min of anoxia, large DMPO-OH (aN = aH = 14.9 G) and smaller DMPO-R (aN = 15.8 G, aH = 22.8 G) signals were seen. Superoxide dismutase totally quenched this radical generation. The ferric iron chelator deferoxamine prevented cell death and totally quenched the DMPO-R signal with a 40% decrease in the DMPO-OH signal. Xanthine oxidase was shown to be present in these cells and to be the primary source of free radicals. While the concentration of this enzyme did not change after anoxia, the concentration of its substrate, hypoxanthine, markedly increased, resulting in increased free radical generation upon reoxygenation. Thus, reoxygenated human vascular endothelial cells generate superoxide free radicals, which further react with iron to form the reactive hydroxyl radical, which in turn causes cell death. Xanthine oxidase was the primary source of radical generation with this process triggered by the breakdown of ATP to the substrate hypoxanthine during anoxia."
https://openalex.org/W1554826176,"The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is involved in fluid and electrolyte absorption across a number of epithelia, and cloning of several ENaC subunits has begun to facilitate investigation of the structure, function, and regulation of this channel. Analysis of the amino acid sequence has revealed two potential membrane-spanning domains, but little else is known about the structure of ENaC. To investigate the membrane topology of one subunit, alpha rENaC, we used in vitro transcription, translation, and translocation into microsomal membranes. This generated a glycosylated protein of 93 kDa. Sequence analysis also revealed eight potential sites for N-glycosylation, six of which were found to be glycosylated (Asn190, Asn259, Asn320, Asn339, Asn424, and Asn538), indicating that they are extracellular. The C terminus was localized as intracellular based on antibody recognition and protease sensitivity of a tagged epitope at the C terminus. The N terminus was also found to be intracellular, based on its protease sensitivity. Similar results were obtained by expression in Xenopus oocytes. Together, these results support a model of alpha rENaC consisting of an intracellular N terminus and C terminus, a large N-glycosylated extracellular domain, and two membrane-spanning domains that each pass once through the plasma membrane. Because of their sequence similarity, it is likely that this structure is shared by other ENaC subunits and possibly the degenerins of Caenorhabditis elegans as well."
https://openalex.org/W2109254221,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate R1 (NMDA R1), NMDA R2A, and NMDA R2C subunits were expressed transiently in double or triple combinations in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The biochemical and pharmacological properties of the cloned receptors were compared with those of adult mouse forebrain and cerebellum. Under conditions established for maximal expression, cotransfection of the NMDA R1 and R2C subunits yielded a protein detected immunologically with a molecular size of 780,000-850,000 daltons. No cell death was observed in the transfected cells, and the KD for [3H]MK801 binding to the NMDA R1/R2C receptor was 346 +/- 158 nM. This was in contrast to a value of KD = 22 +/- 9 nM found for native cerebellar receptors. Co-transfection with NMDA R1/R2A/R2C subunits with a DNA ratio, 1:3:3, resulted in the expression of a protein with a size similar to the NMDA R1/R2C combination, but the affinity of [3H]MK801 was now 22 +/- 5 nM, and the percentage cell death post-transfection was 89 +/- 17%. Immunoprecipitation assays of detergent-solubilized transfected cells with NMDA R1 subunit-specific antibodies co-precipitated the NMDA R2A and NMDA R2C subunits in 1/2A and 1/2C transfections, respectively. Similarly, immunoprecipitations with either NMDA R1 or NMDA R2C subunit-specific antibodies co-precipitated the NMDA R2A subunit in the R1/2A/2C triple transfections. These results show that the three NMDA receptor subunit types can co-assemble following their co-expression in mammalian cells with a pharmacological profile that is similar to that found for adult cerebellar NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1592376553,"Na,K-ATPase is a potential target for regulatory phosphorylation by protein kinase A and C (PKA and PKC). To identify the phosphorylation sites, we have mutated the alpha 1-subunit of Bufo marinus in a highly conservative PKA and in 20 different PKC consensus sequences. The mutants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their phosphorylation capacity tested in homogenates upon stimulation of PKA or PKC. While serine 943 (Ser-943) was identified as a unique target site for PKA, none of the PKC consensus serine or threonine residues are implicated in PKC phosphorylation. Controlled trypsinolysis of phosphorylated alpha-subunits of various purified enzyme preparations and of alpha/beta complexes from oocyte homogenates revealed that PKC phosphorylation was exclusively associated with the N terminus. A fusion protein containing the first 32 amino acids of the Bufo alpha-subunit was phosphorylated in vitro and serine and threonine residues (Thr-15 and Ser-16) in this region were identified by site-directed mutagenesis as the PKC phosphorylation sites. Finally, the Bufo alpha-subunit was phosphorylated by protein kinases in transfected COS-7 cells. In intact cells, PKA stimulation induced phosphorylation exclusively on Ser-943 and PKC stimulation mainly on Thr-15 and Ser-16, which are contained in a novel PKC phosphorylation motif."
https://openalex.org/W1508171779,"Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) serve many different signal transduction pathways. Phosducin, a 28-kDa phosphoprotein, is expressed in a variety of mammalian cell types and blocks activation of several classes of G-proteins. Phosphorylation of phosducin by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase prevents phosducin-mediated inhibition of G-protein GTPase activity (Bauer, P. H., Muller, S., Puzicha, M., Pippig, S., Obermaier, B., Helmreich, E. J. M., and Lohse, M. J. (1992) Nature 358, 73-76). In retinal rods, phosducin inhibits transducin (Gt) activation by binding its beta gamma subunits. While rod phosducin is phosphorylated in the dark and dephosphorylated after illumination (Lee, R.-H., Brown, B. M., and Lolley, R. N. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 1972-1977), the significance of these reactions is still unclear. The data presented here permit a more precise characterization of phosducin function and the consequences of its phosphorylation. Dephosphophosducin blocked binding of the Gt alpha 1 subunit to activated rhodopsin in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of Gt beta gamma, whereas phosphophosducin did not. Surprisingly, the binding affinity of phosphophosducin for Gt beta gamma was not significantly reduced compared with the binding affinity of dephosphophosducin. However, the association of phosducin with Gt beta gamma in a size exclusion column matrix was dependent on the phosphorylation state of phosducin. Moreover, the ability of phosducin to compete with Gt alpha for binding to Gt beta gamma was also dependent on the phosphorylation state of phosducin. No interaction was found between phosducin and Gt alpha. These data indicate that phosducin decreases rod responsiveness by binding to the beta gamma subunits of Gt and preventing their interaction with Gt alpha, thereby inhibiting Gt alpha activation by the activated receptor. Moreover, phosphorylation of phosducin blocks its ability to compete with Gt alpha for binding to Gt beta gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1521831608,"Striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin expressed in Escherichia coli is unacetylated, polymerizes poorly, and binds weakly to F-actin (Hitchcock-DeGregori, S. E., and Heald, R. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9730-9735). To define the structural requirements of NH2-terminal modification for striated tropomyosin function, an acetylated recombinant tropomyosin and an unacetylated short fusion recombinant tropomyosin were compared. An acetylated recombinant chicken striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin was expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression vector system. The purified tropomyosin (approximately 15 mg/liter of insect cell suspension) polymerized, comigrated with chicken striated alpha-tropomyosin purified from muscle on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels, was blocked at the NH2 terminus, and had the same actin affinity as muscle tropomyosin. These results conclusively show the importance of NH2-terminal acetylation for striated tropomyosin function. To learn if a short fusion peptide would substitute for amino-terminal acetylation, tropomyosin with AlaSer-Arg on the NH2 terminus was constructed and expressed in E. coli as an unacetylated protein. This f3-tropomyosin bound to actin with a 10-fold higher affinity than striated muscle alpha-TM and, unlike muscle tropomyosin, exhibited a shear-dependent viscosity. The altered function of f3-tropomyosin shows that the naturally occurring acetylated NH2 terminus is required for full, normal function. It is proposed that a major requirement for cooperative binding of striated muscle tropomyosin to actin is modification of the alpha-amino group of methionine to be an amide, as when acetylated or in a peptide bond in a fusion protein, to make the extreme NH2 terminus more hydrophobic. The results are discussed in terms of known coiled coil structure."
https://openalex.org/W1483874824,"Three subunits, Ac115, Ac39, and the proteolipid, were positively identified in the membrane sectors of V-ATPases from different sources. We searched for organelle-specific protein in purified preparations of V-ATPase from bovine chromaffin granules. A diffused protein band at a position of about 45 kDa was identified in SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the above preparation. Following digestion with endopeptidase Glu-C (V-8), a polypeptide of about 10 kDa was isolated and subjected to amino acid sequencing. Hence, the cDNA encoding the protein Ac45 was cloned from a bovine adrenal medulla library. The cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 468 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 51,786 daltons. A potential signal sequence comprised of the first 35 amino acids and a potential transmembrane domain at the C terminus of the protein were identified. There exist seven potential glycosylation sites between the aforementioned protein motifs. Experiments with a specific antibody against Ac45 demonstrated that it is copurifying with the V-ATPase from chromaffin granules. Immunological cross-reactivity was observed with purified V-ATPase from bovine kidney microsomes but not from plasma membranes of epithelial cells. Cell-free expression of the protein from synthetic mRNA produced a single protein band at about 50 kDa on SDS gels. Upon inclusion of dog pancreas microsomes in the reaction mixture, a slow migrating band sensitive to peptide:N-glycosidase F was observed."
https://openalex.org/W2117096460,"Abstract A short, proline-rich region spanning residues 566-577 in human 5-lipoxygenase is a binding site for the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), an adaptor protein for tyrosine kinase-mediated cell signaling. Purified 5-lipoxygenase bound to glutathione S-transferase fusion products of Grb2 and a truncated version of Grb2 containing its SH3 domain. A peptide corresponding to the proline-rich, SH3-binding motif inhibited formation of the 5-lipoxygenase.Grb2 complex in vitro. The peptide also inhibited the redistribution of 5-lipoxygenase from the cytosol to the membrane in intact or permeabilized neutrophils activated by calcium ionophore A23187. 5-Lipoxygenase did not bind to the SH3 domains of other signaling proteins, such as GTPase-activating protein and phospholipase C gamma; however, it bound to certain cytoskeletal proteins including alpha-actinin and actin. 5-Lipoxygenase contains a consensus guanine nucleotide-binding site at residues 296-299, and guanine nucleotides inhibit 5-lipoxygenase activity in vitro. Our results suggest that 5-lipoxygenase may have a previously unrecognized role in tyrosine kinase signaling, distinct from its catalysis of lipid mediator formation. Our results also clarify the molecular basis for compartmentalization and translocation of 5-lipoxygenase in myeloid cells, implying that it binds to proteins other than its activating protein."
https://openalex.org/W1643229297,"Abstract The rat kidney ROM-K1 potassium channel cDNA was used to clone the homolog from human kidney using a combination of cDNA cloning, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and primer extension cloning methods. In addition to the human species homolog of ROM-K1, four additional transcripts that are formed by alternative splicing of a single human gene were also characterized (hROM-K2 to hROM-K5). All five transcripts share a common 3' exon that encodes the majority of the channel protein and in three of the isoforms translation is initiated at a start codon contained within this exon (hROM-K2, hROM-K4, and hROM-K5). The two other transcripts contain additional exons that potentially extend the open reading frame by either 19 amino acid residues (hROM-K1) or by 17 amino acid residues (hROM-K3). Comparison of the translation products from the three representative transcripts (hROM-K1, hROM-K2, and hROM-K3) confirmed that hROM-K1 gave the largest product (41.6 kDa) and was translated more efficiently than either hROM-K2 or hROM-K3. Also, despite the presence of several additional canonical acceptor sites for Asn-linked glycosylation relative to rat ROM-K1, all three channel polypeptides were glycosylated to a similar extent in the in vitro translation reactions when canine pancreatic microsomes were included. A survey of the tissue distribution of expression of the various forms in selected human tissues showed that the core-exon linked to all four possible 5' exons are detected almost exclusively in kidney. The core-exon was also detected in human kidney and lower amounts were detected in skeletal muscle > pancreas > spleen > brain = heart > liver RNAs by RT-PCR. Alternatively, Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNAs from these same tissues revealed a 2.8-kilobase transcript only in kidney. Heterologous expression of either the hROM-K1, hROM-K2, or hROM-K3 channel transcripts in Xenopus oocytes led to the expression of K(+)-selective, Ba(2+)-sensitive inwardly rectifying channels as measured by whole cell currents. At this level of analysis, the channel properties of the individual forms could not be distinguished."
https://openalex.org/W1581529107,"Compartmentalization of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase is maintained by association of the regulatory subunit (RII) with A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs). In previous studies (Scott, J. D., Stofko, R. E., McDonald, J. R., Comer, J. D., Vitalis, E. A., and Mangili J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21561-21566) we have shown that dimerization of RII alpha was required for interaction with the cytoskeletal component microtubule-associated protein 2. In this report we show that the localization and dimerization domains of RII alpha are contained within the first thirty residues of each RII protomer. RII des-5 (an amino-terminal deletion mutant lacking residues 1-5) was unable to bind AKAPs but retained the ability to dimerize. RII alpha I3A,I5A (a mutant where isoleucines 3 and 5 were replaced with alanine) was unable to bind a variety of AKAPs. Mutation of both isoleucines decreased AKAP binding without affecting dimerization, cAMP binding, or the overall secondary structure of the protein. Measurement of RII alpha I3A,I5A interaction with the human thyroid AKAP, Ht 31, by two independent methods suggests that mutation of isoleucines 3 and 5 decreases affinity by at least 6-fold. Therefore, we propose that two isoleucine side chains on each RII protomer are principle sites of contact with the conserved amphipathic helix binding domain on AKAPs."
https://openalex.org/W1552451078,"A novel cytoplasmic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), PTPL1, was identified and cloned using a polymerase chain reaction-based approach. Overlapping cDNA clones encompass an open reading frame of 7398 base pairs, predicting a protein of 2466 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 275 kDa. PTPL1 has a wide tissue distribution, a 9.5-kilobase transcript being expressed in most tissues. Peptide antisera against PTPL1 specifically precipitate a protein with an apparent mass of 250 kDa. PTPL1 has a PTP domain located in the COOH terminus, and the protein was shown to dephosphorylate 32P-labeled myelin basic protein. In the non-enzymatic part of PTPL1, three different structural motifs can be identified. Two of these are often found in proteins at the interface between the plasma membrane and the cytoskeleton, i.e. a 300-amino acid domain with similarity to the band 4.1 superfamily, and a region consisting of five GLGF repeats, an 80-amino acid repeat found in a variety of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. In addition to these structures PTPL1 has a region that fulfills the criteria for a leucine zipper motif. PTPL1 is the hitherto largest PTP identified and the only one known which contains a leucine zipper motif."
https://openalex.org/W1599371567,"Our laboratory recently identified a sodium-dependent transport system for phosphate from rat kidney cortex (NaPi-2; Magagnin, S., Werner, A., Markovich, D., Sorribas, V., Stange, G., Biber, J., and Murer, H. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 5979-5983). In the present study we have investigated whether or not this cotransporter is glycosylated and the role of N-glycosylation in determining its function. Glycosidase digestion of the NaPi-2 protein from rat brush border membranes, in vitro translation studies, or oocyte expression of the NaPi-2 cRNA indicate that the mature protein is glycosylated. Glycosidase treatment reduces the size of the protein from approximately 70-110 kDa to approximately 60-65 kDa. We therefore used site-directed mutagenesis to identify which of the putative consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation are utilized in the mature NaPi-2 protein. Altering the nucleotide sequences encoding both of the Asn-298 and Asn-328 residues to Gln produced mutants that are completely devoid of glycosylation, whereas mutants in which each of these sites were mutated separately are glycosylated when expressed in oocytes. These results suggest that both of these sites are modified by N-linked glycosylation in the mature protein. Surface expression of glycosylated and unglycosylated NaPi-2-related proteins was documented by biotinylation experiments. In contrast to the wild-type (fully glycosylated) transporter, immunocytochemistry provides evidence for a partial intracellular localization of mutant unglycosylated cotransporters. Na/Pi cotransport was studied in oocytes expressing wild-type or mutagenized NaPi-2 proteins using tracer or electrophysiological techniques. Although the transport rates are lower (by a factor of 2-3) after expression of the unglycosylated NaPi-2 protein, the Pi transport characteristics (pH dependence, apparent affinity for Pi or Na+) are similar in oocytes expressing either wild-type or glycosylation-deficient proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1581933655,"Cross-linking of leukocyte Fc receptors specific for IgG (Fc gamma Rs) by multivalent IgG complexes triggers a wide range of immune functions. Many of these responses can also be stimulated in vitro using anti-Fc gamma R monoclonal antibody-containing complexes. This observation has suggested that cross-linking is the key event and that binding of IgG, which in itself does not elicit a response, is functionally passive. However, in this study we show that binding of monomeric IgG to the human high affinity receptor, Fc gamma RI, is itself sufficient to permit the receptor to enter an internalization-recycling pathway, which has a small intracellular pool. Unoccupied Fc gamma RI is not internalized and recycled in this manner. This finding may be explained by the previous observation that there is a physical association between Fc gamma RI and the cytoskeletal component, actin-binding protein (non-muscle filamin; ABP-280), which is disrupted upon IgG binding. Thus, in the absence of IgG, Fc gamma RI may be physically excluded from the endocytic pathway by tethering to the cytoskeleton. The role of cross-linking is to divert Fc gamma RI-IgG complexes from the recycling pathway, causing their retention and subsequent degradation within the cell. In contrast to Fc gamma RII-mediated endocytosis, intracellular accumulation of cross-linked Fc gamma RI-IgG complexes is not sensitive to inhibition by genistein, suggesting that the process is independent of tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1560122944,"We have examined the molecular mechanism that enables the T4 bacteriophage DNA polymerase holoenzyme to synthesize DNA processively on the leading strand of the replication fork for many minutes, while allowing an identical holoenzyme on the lagging strand to recycle from one Okazaki fragment to the next in less than 4 s. We use a perfect hairpin helix of 15 base pairs to mimic the encounter of the polymerase with the end of a previously synthesized Okazaki fragment. Polymerase dissociation is monitored during the stall at the hairpin helix by the addition of excess T4 gene 32 protein (SSB protein), which rapidly melts the helix and allows a stalled polymerase molecule to continue DNA synthesis. In the accompanying paper, we show that polymerase holoenzyme dissociation is slow (half-life of 2.5 min) when this enzyme is stalled by nucleotide omission (Hacker, K. J., and Alberts, B. M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 24209-24220). In contrast, the holoenzyme dissociates with a half-life of 1 s after hitting the hairpin helix, a rate sufficient to allow efficient polymerase recycling on the lagging strand in vivo. We conclude that, upon completing each Okazaki fragment, the holoenzyme senses an encounter with duplex DNA and then switches to a state that rapidly dissociates."
https://openalex.org/W1590187392,"Previous studies of rat ucp (uncoupling protein) gene organization carried out in this laboratory identified regulatory sequences located in the 5'-flanking region. In this work, DNase I footprint analysis of the enhancer revealed two domains at base pairs (bp) -2444 to -2423 and bp -2352 to -2319. The former domain can bind in vitro, in a cooperative manner, factors related to nuclear factor 1 and Ets1; the latter domain contains a type 3 directly repeated sequence that was shown to be able to bind the retinoid X and triiodothyronine receptors. Moreover, a positive effect of retinoic acid on ucp mRNA levels in immortalized brown adipocytes was observed. DNase I footprint analysis identified two hypersensitive regions, A and B, at bp -509 to -472 and bp -403 to -350, respectively; region A contains a repeated CACCC box, and region B can bind protein related to Ets1. The A box differentially binds liver and brown adipose tissue nuclear proteins and could be involved in uncoupling protein induction. Further analysis showed three foot-printed boxes, C-E, at bp -182 to -159, -147 to -120, and -111 to -85, able to bind in vitro proteins related to nuclear factor 1, cAMP response element-binding protein, and Sp1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1486027626,"In this study we examined the involvement of the focal adhesion-associated proteins p125FAK and paxillin as substrates for bradykinin (BK)-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in Swiss 3T3 cells and the potential role of protein kinase C and Ca2+ in these events. BK (1 microM) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK and paxillin. In addition, BK also increased the phosphotyrosine content of the src transformation-associated protein p130. The responses were rapid and transient and peaked at approximately 1 min after BK addition. Furthermore, the responses were dose-dependent with half-maximal effects occurring at 1-10 nM BK. The phosphotyrosine content of p125FAK, paxillin, and p130 was also increased following stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (0.1 microM). In contrast, PMA had no effect on the phosphotyrosine content of p125, a Ras-GAP-associated tyrosine phosphoprotein that we recently identified. Long term pretreatment (18 h) of cells with 0.3 microM PMA partially attenuated BK-stimulated phosphorylation of p125FAK but was without effect on phosphorylation of paxillin and Ras-GAP-associated p125. Furthermore, only a small inhibition of BK- and PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of p125FAK was observed following pretreatment with 25 microM BAPTA/AM. In all, these results show that multiple mechanisms are involved in BK-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK, paxillin, Ras-GAP-associated p125, and src transformation-associated p130."
https://openalex.org/W1567903209,"To elucidate the mode of action of pseudomonic acid, we have compared the deduced amino acid sequences of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (ILeRS) from wild-type Escherichia coli strain MC4100, a pseudomonic acid-resistant mutant (strain PS102) of MC4100, and a pseudomonic acid-producing strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the deduced amino acid sequence of E. coli mutant ileS gene in strain PS102 shows a single amino acid substitution of leucine for phenylalanine at residue 594 of the IleRS. This mutational alteration in IleRS of an E. coli pseudomonic acid-resistant mutant resides in a region of the enzyme in close proximity to one of the consensus sequences of class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, the KMSKS sequence between residues 602 and 606 of the E. coli IleRS. DNA sequence of the cloned ileS gene predicts that the P. fluorescens IleRS consists of 943 amino acids with 54% identity with the E. coli IleRS. The P. fluorescens ileS gene and the wild type and PS102 alleles of E. coli ileS were cloned into an expression vector, pEXPCR, and the sensitivities of E. coli DH5 alpha cells harboring each of these plasmids were compared. The cells harboring the P. fluorescens ileS were found to be most resistant to pseudomonic acid, while the transformants expressing the PS102 IleRS were more resistant than those containing the wild-type E. coli IleRS. IleRS purified from the wild-type E. coli was specifically cleaved by trypsin between Lys605 and Ser606 in the region of K602MSKS606. The protection of the IleRS from the trypsin digestion was found with pseudomonic acid or ATP, but not with isoleucine or tRNA(1Ile). Based on these results, we propose that pseudomonic acid binds to IleRS in the vicinity of the KMSKS sequence that is an ATP-binding subsite, and that pseudomonic acid is a bifunctional inhibitor with characteristics of both isoleucine and ATP, for example, an analog of isoleucyladenylate."
https://openalex.org/W1488862635,"The infection of human colonic epithelial cells HT-29 by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) occurs independently of CD4, the main HIV-1 receptor expressed on lymphocytes and macrophages. Recent studies from our group have shown that HT-29 cells express the glycosphingolipid galactosylceramide (GalCer), a potential alternative receptor for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120. The binding of recombinant gp120 to GalCer was blocked by monoclonal antibodies directed against the third variable region (V3) of gp120, suggesting that the V3 domain was implicated in GalCer recognition. In the present report, we show that suramin, a polysulfonyl naphtylurea known to inhibit retroviral reverse transcriptases in vitro, blocks HIV-1 infection in HT-29 cells. The effect is dose dependent, with a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) achieved for a suramin concentration of 54 micrograms/ml. Since [3H]suramin was not significantly internalized into HT-29 cells during our infection assay (i.e. 2 h), we have considered the possibility that the drug could act at an extracellular step of the HIV-1 cycle. Using a high performance thin layer chromatography binding assay, we show that suramin inhibits binding of HIV-1 gp120 to purified GalCer with an IC50 of 25 micrograms/ml. Suramin does not bind to GalCer, since preincubation of GalCer with suramin did not prevent the subsequent attachment of gp120. Using a solid-phase assay, we show that [3H]suramin specifically binds to recombinant gp120 and that this binding could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for the conserved GPGRAF motif of the V3 domain of gp120. We also demonstrate that [3H]suramin binds to multibranched synthetic GPGRAF peptides that block HIV-1 infection in HT-29 cells. Binding of [3H]suramin to V3 peptides is specific and inhibited by unlabeled suramin (IC50 of 28 micrograms/ml). In contrast, the suramin derivative NF036, that is unable to block HIV-1 infection in HT-29 cells, does not inhibit the binding of [3H]suramin to V3 peptides. Taken together, these results suggest that suramin blocks HIV-1 infection in HT-29 cells because it binds to the V3 domain of gp120 and hence prevents the interaction between gp120 and the GalCer receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1539182448,"Replication Protein A (RPA) is a multisubunit, single-stranded DNA-binding protein essential for DNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells. The 32-kDa subunit of RPA is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner becoming phosphorylated during S phase. It has been postulated that this phosphorylation may regulate the activities of RPA and that the family of p34cdc2 kinases directly catalyzes the phosphorylation of RPA in the cell. We have mutated the two consensus p34cdc2 sites in the 32-kDa subunit of RPA individually and in combination and purified the mutant protein complexes. Mutant RPA with both consensus p34cdc2 sites converted to alanine was not phosphorylated by purified p34cdc2 kinase. Nevertheless, we found that the properties of these RPA mutants were identical to those of the wild-type protein. The mutated RPA proteins had normal single-stranded DNA binding activity and were completely functional for DNA replication. In addition, the mutants became hyperphosphorylated when incubated under DNA replication conditions. These results demonstrate that phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase is not essential for RPA function in DNA replication in vitro. Possible roles of RPA phosphorylation on DNA metabolism are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1493572438,"The protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana secretes a heavily glycosylated 100-kDa acid phosphatase (sAP) which is associated with one or more polydisperse proteophosphoglycans. Most of the glycans in this complex were released using mild acid hydrolysis conditions that preferentially cleave phosphodiester linkages. The released saccharides were shown to consist of monomeric mannose and a series of neutral and phosphorylated glycans by Dionex high performance liquid chromatography, methylation analysis, exoglycosidase digestions, and one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy. The neutral species comprised a linear series of oligosaccharides with the structures [Man alpha 1-2]1-5Man. The phosphorylated oligosaccharides were characterized as PO4-6Gal beta 1-4Man and PO4-6[Glc beta 1-3]Gal beta 1-4Man. The attachment of these glycans to the polypeptide backbone via the linkage, Man alpha 1-PO4-Ser, is suggested by: 1) the finding that more than 60% of the serine residues in the polypeptide are phosphorylated and 2) the resistance of the phosphoserine residues to alkaline phosphatase digestion unless the sAP was first treated with either mild acid (to release all glycans) or jack bean alpha-mannosidase (to release neutral mannose glycans). Analysis of the partially resolved components of the complex indicated that the most of the O-linked glycans on the 100-kDa phosphoglycoprotein comprised mannose and the mannose-oligosaccharides. In contrast the major O-linked glycans on the proteophosphoglycan were short phosphoglycan chains, containing on average two repeat units per chain. In addition to the O-linked glycans, both components in the sAP complex contained N-linked glycans. The N-glycanase F-released glycans were characterized by Bio-Gel P4 chromatography and exoglycosidase digestions to be the biantennary oligomannose type with the structures Glc1Man6GlcNAc2 and Man6GlcNAc2. The O-linked glycans of the sAP complex are similar to those found in the phosphoglycan chains of the abundant surface lipophosphoglycan, but differ in having much shorter phosphoglycan chains and a more diverse series of mannose cap oligosaccharides. These data suggest that there are marked differences in the ability of different glycosyltransferases to utilize peptide-linked versus glycolipid-linked acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1506559734,"Riboflavin binding protein (ribBP) is an essential component of chicken eggs; it supplies the oocyte (i.e. yolk) and egg white with sufficient amounts of the vitamin riboflavin to sustain embryonic development until hatching. There are three forms of ribBP in the laying hen; synthesized by the liver under the control of estrogen, it enters the serum (sribBP) and is delivered to yolk where it becomes carboxyl-terminally truncated (yribBP). The egg white form (wribBP), synthesized by the oviduct, is a product of the same gene as sribBP but has a different glycosylation pattern. Our efforts to delineate the mechanism for uptake of yolk precursors into rapidly growing chicken oocytes have previously identified a multifunctional oocyte-specific 95-kDa lipoprotein receptor that belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family (Barber, D.L., Sanders, E.J., Aebersold, R., and Schneider, W.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 18761-18770). We now report that in serum, ribBP associates with another yolk precursor, the lipid-, phosphate-, and ion-carrier vitellogenin (VTG), a known ligand of the 95-kDa receptor. In the presence of VTG, 125I-labeled sribBP binds to the 95-kDa receptor and, under certain conditions, also to the avian oocyte low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (Stifani, S., Barber, D.L., Aebersold, R., Steyrer, E., Shen, X., Nimpf, J., and Schneider, W.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19079-19087). The interaction between ribBP and the 95-kDa receptor and/or VTG requires Ca2+ and PO4(3-). Interestingly, sribBP, yribBP, and wribBP are all capable of VTG-associated receptor binding. This demonstrates that (i) the carboxyl-terminal 11 or 13 amino acids, which are removed from sribBP upon oocytic uptake, are not involved in receptor binding and (ii) receptor binding and/or association of ribBP with VTG is not dependent on the carbohydrate structure present on sribBP. The results indicate that the oocytic uptake of sribBP is mediated, through association with VTG, by the 95-kDa receptor and possibly other oocytic members of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family, adding an interesting and novel variation to ligand recognition by these receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1581256056,"This report describes for the first time the identification of four forms of biliverdin reductase including two biliverdin-IX beta reductases and two biliverdin-IX alpha reductases, designated isozymes I and II and isozymes III and IV, respectively, in human liver cytosolic fractions. The four forms of biliverdin reductase were purified to homogeneity. There was a 7,800-15,000-fold increase in specific activity when compared with the crude preparation, and the recovery was 8-26%. The purified enzymes were monomers with a molecular weight of about 21,000 (isozymes I and II) and 34,000 (isozymes III and IV). The enzymes were strictly specific for biliverdin, and no other oxidoreductase activities were detected in the purified preparations. The purified enzymes used NADPH and NADH as electron donors for the reduction of biliverdin. The apparent Km values of isozymes I, II, III, and IV for NADPH were 35.9, 13.1, 10.9, and 34.1 microM, respectively, whereas those for NADH were 5.6, 8.2, 7.9, and 23.4 mM, respectively. It was assumed that NADPH rather than NADH was the physiological electron donor in the intracellular reduction of biliverdin. The apparent Km value of isozymes I and II for biliverdin-IX beta in the NADPH system was 0.3 microM whereas those of isozymes III and IV for biliverdin-IX alpha were 1.0 and 0.8 microM, respectively. Isozymes I and II used biliverdin-IX beta, -IX gamma, and -IX delta as substrates but not biliverdin-IX alpha, and isozymes III and IV preferred biliverdin-IX alpha as the most effective substrate among the four biliverdin isomers. The NADPH-dependent enzyme activities were inhibited by substrate concentrations in excess of 3-4 microM. The NADPH-dependent enzyme activities, especially isozymes III and IV, were sensitive to SH reagents including iodoacetamide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and N-ethylmaleimide. The optimum pH of the reaction with NADPH for isozymes I and II was 8.2 whereas that for isozymes III and IV was 7.4. The proportion of the total activity of isozymes I and II to that of isozymes III and IV was considerably higher in the fetal than in the adult liver."
https://openalex.org/W1556815263,"Procollagen chains assemble in a type-specific manner forming either homo- or heterotrimers. The molecular mechanisms underlying procollagen chain selectivity are unknown, although it is thought that the C-propeptide (COOH-terminal propeptide) is responsible for directing chain recognition and assembly. To define the processes involved in chain selection we reconstituted the initial stages of procollagen folding and assembly in a cell-free system. Using human pro-alpha 1(III) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains as prototypes of chains that are either capable or incapable of forming homotrimeric molecules, respectively, we constructed two minigenes (p alpha 1(III) delta 1 and p alpha 2(I) delta 1) that lacked most of the triple helical domains. The minigenes were transcribed in vitro and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with microsomal membranes under conditions that favored disulfide bond formation. Both pro-alpha 1(III) delta 1 and pro-alpha 2(I) delta 1 chains formed intrachain disulfide bonds within the C-propeptide. However, only pro-alpha 1(III) delta 1 chains were able to self-associate forming homotrimers stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds. The C-propeptide of the pro-alpha 1(III) chain contains 8 cysteine residues (Cys-1-8). We used a site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of specific cysteine residues in trimer formation and found that substitution of serine for Cys-1, Cys-2, Cys-3, and Cys-4 prevented interchain disulfide bonding and trimerization. Furthermore, mutations in Cys-1 and Cys-4 also prevented intrachain disulfide bond formation within the C-propeptide. The C-propeptide of the pro-alpha 2(I) chain contains only 7 cysteine residues, lacking cysteine at position 2. Substitution of the existing Ser residue with Cys did not produce a homotrimeric phenotype, indicating that additional recognition signals are required to determine chain selection."
https://openalex.org/W1608820323,"The fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA) causes the inhibition of protein secretion and the disruption of the structure and function of the Golgi complex in mammalian cells. Here we show that BFA has identical effects in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe which normally contains a Golgi complex of stacked cisternae similar to the Golgi complexes in animal cells. After treatment with BFA, secretion was inhibited, Golgi complexes disappeared, and there was an accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum. These results indicate that the effects of BFA in fungi are very similar to those in mammalian cells and provide direct evidence for an effect of BFA on Golgi morphology in fungi. Five spontaneous BFA-resistant mutants were isolated. Genetic analysis showed that the mutations conferring BFA resistance were dominant and in two separate linkage groups. One of the BFA-resistant mutations was found to be allelic to crm1, a gene affecting chromatin structure. All BFA-resistant mutants overexpressed a 20-kDa protein, and the corresponding gene obr1 was isolated and sequenced. However, obr1 overexpression was not sufficient to confer BFA resistance. Plasmids capable of conferring BFA resistance to wild type cells were isolated from libraries constructed from the two BFA-resistant mutants. These plasmids contain six different genes capable of conferring resistance when present in high copy. One of these genes encoded the transcription factor pap1, a homolog of the mammalian AP1 protein. The overexpression of pap1 probably confers BFA resistance indirectly by inducing expression of one or more other proteins. The isolation of several genes conferring BFA resistance suggests several mechanisms are involved."
https://openalex.org/W1535147323,"Yeast vacuoles contain an H(+)-ATPase that acidifies the vacuolar lumen and generates an electrochemical gradient of protons across their membranes. Five polypeptides, denoted as subunits A to E in the order of decreasing molecular masses from 69 to 27 kDa, were identified in the catalytic sector of the enzyme. However, other polypeptides may be necessary for the activity of the enzyme. When a 14-kDa polypeptide was suggested to be a subunit of a specialized V-ATPase in Manduca sexta, and a homologous short sequence was detected downstream of the UGA1 gene in yeast, we cloned this counterpart gene from yeast. The gene VMA7 encodes a protein Vma7p of about 14 kDa. The predicted protein is highly homologous to the above mentioned M. sexta protein. The delta vma7::URA3 null mutant exhibits growth characteristics typical of other VMA disruptant mutants in genes encoding subunits of the catalytic sector. The delta vma7::URA3 null mutants are not able to grow on a medium buffered at pH 7.5, they fail to accumulate quinacrine into their vacuoles and the other subunits of the catalytic sector are not assembled onto the vacuolar membrane in its absence. Epitope-tagged Vma7p was constructed and the proton uptake activity of isolated vacuoles from this yeast strain was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against the epitope-tag. A cold inactivation experiment demonstrated that Vma7p is a genuine subunit of the catalytic sector of V-ATPase and it is denoted as subunit F."
https://openalex.org/W1537228249,"Two versions of the calmodulin binding domain of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase, a 24-amino acid peptide, C24W (Q-I-L-W-F-R-G-L-N-R-I-Q-T-Q-I-R-V-V-N-A-F-R-S-S-NH2), and the corresponding phosphothreonine containing peptide, C24W-P (Q-I-L-W-F-R-G-L-N-R-I-Q-T(phospho)-Q-I-R-V-V-N-A-F-R-S-S-NH2), were synthesized. They were used to investigate the effect of threonine phosphorylation by protein kinase C on the binding of calmodulin by the calmodulin binding domain and on the inhibitory role of the domain on the activity of the Ca2+ pump. The phosphopeptide C24W-P was obtained after global phosphorylation of the free Thr side chain on the protected resin bound peptide. The phosphorylated calmodulin binding domain failed to bind calmodulin; this was shown by gel shift experiments, by fluorescence energy transfer studies and by competition experiments against calmodulin stimulation of the pump. The inhibition of the Ca2+ pump activity by the calmodulin binding domain in the absence of calmodulin was also affected by the phosphorylation of the threonine; the inhibition of the fully active calpain-truncated pump by the phosphothreonine containing peptide was lower than that by the unphosphorylated synthetic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1555539264,"Calpastatin is a widely distributed endogenous inhibitor protein specifically acting on calpain (Ca(2+)-dependent proteinase) and is known to interact with the calmodulin-like domain (CaMLD) of the proteinase in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. The calpastatin molecule consists of four inhibitory domains (domains 1-4) with mutually homologous sequences in three regions designated as A, B, and C. Acidic amphiphilic alpha-helical motifs are found in both regions A and C. We investigated the correlation between the calpain inhibition potency and the ability of calpastatin to bind to recombinant CaMLD of the mu-calpain large subunit using various mutant proteins of pig calpastatin domain 1 expressed in Escherichia coli. Substitution of conserved Leu-161 with Pro in region A caused a reduction in activity of both calpain inhibition and CaMLD binding. Additional substitution of Leu-236 with Pro in region C further decreased the calpain inhibitory activity and caused a loss of CaMLD binding ability. The effects of mutation in region C alone on the above activities were smaller than those in region A. Although a mutant of deletion in the entire region B had no calpain inhibitory activity, it retained the CaMLD binding ability. On the other hand, although a region B oligopeptide had a moderate inhibitory activity, it had no CaMLD binding ability. These results suggest that region A has a role in potentiating the inhibitory activity of calpastatin by interacting with CaMLD of calpain to form a tighter complex where region B exerts the inhibitory function."
https://openalex.org/W1492863108,"Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a lipoprotein formed by the disulfide linkage of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) to the apoB100 of a low density lipoprotein particle. Earlier site-directed mutagenesis studies of apo(a) demonstrated that apo(a) cysteine 4057 is required for the disulfide linkage; however, the cysteine residue within apoB100 that is involved in the disulfide bond has not been identified. We previously demonstrated that the apoB100 produced by human apoB mice binds to apo(a) and forms Lp(a) (Linton, M.F., Farese, R. V., Jr., Chiesa, G., Grass, D. S., Chin, P., Hammer, R. E., Hobbs, H.H., and Young, S.G. (1993) J. Clin. Invest. 92, 3029-3037). To further explore the structural features of human apoB that are required for the formation of Lp(a), we used a transposon-interrupted human apoB gene clone to develop mice that express high levels of a truncated form of human apoB, apoB90, which contains the amino-terminal 4084 amino acids of apoB. In vitro incubation of apo(a) with the plasma of human apoB90 mice did not yield Lp(a), as judged by Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels or by a monoclonal antibody-based radioimmunoassay. In contrast, incubation of apo(a) with the plasma of a mouse that expressed an equivalent amount of the full-length apoB100 did yield Lp(a). In addition to these in vitro incubation studies, no Lp(a) could be detected in the plasma of a double transgenic mouse expressing both human apoB90 and apo(a). These data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal 10% of apoB100 contains amino acid sequences that are essential for the formation of Lp(a)."
https://openalex.org/W1497257474,"The expression and assembly of particular combinations of beta and gamma subunit isoforms into beta gamma heterodimers may contribute to the specificity of signal transduction mediated by heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins. Using a transient transfection paradigm to examine selectivity in beta gamma heterodimer formation, we find that gamma 1 interacts with beta 1 but not with beta 2, while both beta subunits interact with gamma 2 and that a beta 2/beta 1 chimera containing the N-terminal 41 residues of beta 2 retained a beta 1 phenotype. These results confirm previous reports and imply that a structure or structures between residues 42 and 340 in the C-terminal region of the beta subunit imparts the ability to distinguish between gamma chains. Extending this chimeric approach to further localize the regions of beta important for selectivity between gamma subunits, we find that the region of beta 1 or beta 2 between residue 215 and the C terminus is sufficient to confer the parental phenotype. Additional mutants implicate multiple regions of beta, including discrete residues in the variable connecting segments joining conserved elements of the fifth and sixth GH-WD repeats toward the C terminus of beta. These findings suggest a multidomain interaction between beta and gamma."
https://openalex.org/W1513511290,"The regulation of Cl- and cation conductances by the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (AMP-PCP) was characterized in isolated zymogen granules (ZG) from pancreatic acinar cells. ZG were purified from rat pancreas homogenate by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Cl- conductance was assayed by suspending ZG in isotonic KCl buffer and measuring osmotic lysis induced by maximal permeabilization of ZG membranes (ZGM) for K+ with the K+ ionophore valinomycin (Val). This resulted in influx of K+ through the artificial pathway and of Cl- through endogenous channels. To measure cation conductances ZG (pHi approximately 6) were suspended in pH 7 buffered isotonic monovalent cation acetate salts. The pH gradient was converted into an outside-directed H+ diffusion potential by maximally increasing H+ conductance of ZGM with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone. Osmotic lysis of ZG was induced by H+ diffusion potential driven influx of monovalent cations through endogenous channels and non-ionic diffusion of the counterion acetate. In the absence of Val, ZG were stable in KCl buffer up to 2 h. AMP-PCP enhanced osmotic lysis approximately 4-fold compared to control, due to activation of Cl- conductance by AMP-PCP and K+ influx through an AMP-PCP-insensitive nonselective cation pathway, which could be blocked by 0.1 mM Ba2+, 0.5 mM quinine, or 0.2 mM flufenamate. In addition, a K+ and Rb+ selective cation conductance was found which was completely blocked by 0.5 mM AMP-PCP or 0.5 mM quinine. AMP-PCP induced Cl- conductance was strongly inhibited by two monoclonal antibodies against MDR1 P-glycoprotein (JSB-1 and C219; 5-10 micrograms/ml), but not by a monoclonal antibody against the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (M3A7; 5 micrograms/ml) or by mouse IgG. The AMP-PCP insensitive nonselective cation conductance was not blocked by monoclonal antibodies against MDR1 P-glycoprotein (MDR1). Immunoblot studies of ZG membranes revealed the presence of a major immunoreactive protein band of approximately 65 kDa with both monoclonal antibodies against MDR1, but no protein of the approximate size of MDR1 (approximately 170 kDa) was detected. We propose that the Cl- channel or a regulator of the channel, that is activated by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PCP in ZG membranes, is a member of the ATP binding cassette superfamily of transporters and may have homology to MDR1 P-glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1508734769,"Cyanide binding to cytochrome c oxidase has been investigated by sequential mixing and rapid scan stopped flow spectroscopy. Double mixing experiments confirm earlier reports that cyanide binds rapidly to partially reduced enzyme species formed in turnover. The absorbance/time/wavelength matrices, captured during the onset of cyanide inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by rapid scan stopped flow, were analyzed by singular value decomposition and the spectral contributions of the chromophores separated. Examination of the time courses and amplitudes of the spectral signals provide evidence that entry of a single (1-1.3) electron into the enzyme is sufficient to trigger rapid cyanide binding. This electron resides predominantly on the cytochrome a/CuA pair in the inhibited enzyme. In addition, although cytochrome a3 remains oxidized, it does not appear to be the site for the initial inhibitory binding of cyanide. Our data suggest that CuB2+ is the initial binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1576012635,"The regulation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) expression and nuclear factor (NF) activation by protein kinase C (PKC) in resting T cells, has been studied. Treatment of human resting T cells with phorbol esters strongly induced the expression of IL-2R alpha and the activation of NF.kappa B. This activation was due to the translocation of p65 and c-Rel NF.kappa B proteins from cytoplasmic stores to the nucleus, where they bound the kappa B sequence of the IL-2R alpha promoter either as p50.p65 or as p50.c-Rel heterodimers. Interestingly, all of those events were largely indirect and mediated by endogenously secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), as they were strongly inhibited by a neutralizing anti-TNF alpha monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, cyclosporin A, which blocked TNF alpha production induced by PKC, strongly inhibited IL-2R alpha and NF.kappa B activation. The addition of either TNF alpha or IL-2 partially recovered cyclosporin A-induced IL-2R alpha inhibition, but only TNF alpha completely recovered NF.kappa B activation. Those results indicate that, in resting T cells, PKC activation has only a triggering role, whereas the endogenously secreted TNF alpha plays an essential role in the quantitative control of the expression of IL-2R alpha chain or NF.kappa B activation."
https://openalex.org/W1575000873,"Chemical modification studies of spinach leaf ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase with pyridoxal-P have shown that a highly conserved lysyl residue near the C terminus might be involved in the binding of 3-P-glycerate, the allosteric activator. Site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding residue (Lys419) of the Anabaena enzyme was performed to determine the role of this conserved residue. Replacing Lys419 with either arginine, alanine, glutamine, or glutamic acid produced mutant enzymes with apparent affinities for 3-P-glycerate, 25-150-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant enzymes, however, were still activated to a great extent at higher concentrations of activator suggesting that an additional site or residue was involved in the binding of the activator. These mutations caused lesser or no effect on the kinetic constants for the substrates and inhibitor, P(i), as well as on the catalytic efficiency and thermal stability. The results suggest that both the charge and size of lysine residue 419 are required for the proper binding of 3-P-glycerate. Chemical modification of the Anabaena wild-type enzyme with pyridoxal-P indicated that Lys419 was the only lysyl residue modified. We further performed the same experiment on the K419R mutant enzyme and found another lysyl residue, Lys382, was modified. Reductive phosphopyridoxylation of the wild-type and K419R enzymes caused dramatic alteration in allosteric properties. The activator, 3-P-glycerate, and inhibitor, P(i), protected the enzyme from reductive phosphopyridoxylation. The modified enzymes were more active in the absence of 3-P-glycerate and less sensitive to P(i) inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1588423409,"The lymphoid-specific Src family protein tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck) is non-covalently associated with the cytoplasmic tail of CD4 and has an essential role in T cell activation. Engagement of ligand by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is followed by rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC) and the TCR-associated CD3 zeta polypeptides. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 results in activation of PLC and subsequent phosphatidylinositol turnover. We have studied the effects of the CD4-associated Lck molecule on TCR-mediated activation of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) pathway in a murine T cell hybridoma. Antibodies against CD3 elicited the expected PTK activation, which was enhanced upon co-cross-linking of CD4. In contrast, anti-TCR-alpha beta antibodies had no effect on the PTK pathway unless CD4 was co-cross-linked. Antibody cross-linking of CD4 alone failed to induce the same pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained when a chimeric protein consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 linked to the intracellular Lck molecule was used in place of CD4. The tyrosine kinase activity of Lck was essential for the activity of the chimeric protein. Cross-linking of the CD4/Lck chimera to a CD8/zeta chimeric molecule also facilitated induction of the PTK pathway with anti-CD8 antibodies. Moreover, the interaction of the two chimeric proteins, either in vitro or in vivo, resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD8/zeta. The effects of CD4/Lck on tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC correlated well with the effects on PTK activation. Our results suggest that the Lck molecule positively regulates the TCR-coupled PTK pathway by phosphorylating tyrosines on the TCR-associated CD3 zeta polypeptides."

At the amino acid level the homology was greater with only 16 of the 260 amino acids being different. Northern blot analyses revealed a size of 3.4 kb for mouse dCK mRNA as compared with 2.8 kb for human dCK. Part of the 3'-untranslated region was conserved between human and mouse dCK cDNA in contrast to the remainder of the 3'-sequence which was unrelated and about 500 nucleotides longer in mouse dCK cDNA. Mouse dCK cDNA showed cross-hybridization with several bands in EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from seven different mammalian species and chicken but not with yeast DNA. Both mouse and human dCK were cloned into the T5 promotor pQE30 vector system, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The kinetic constants for dCyd phosphorylation were similar for the human and mouse enzymes and also similar to what previously has been observed for dCK purified from human tissues. Mouse dCK was less efficient with regard to dAdo, dGuo, and ddCyd phosphorylation as compared with human dCK when using ATP as phosphate donor in a phosphoryl transfer assay."
https://openalex.org/W1539813750,"We have developed an experimental assay to monitor the rate of dissociation of the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme (polymerase plus gene 44/62 and 45 proteins) once it has been stalled by nucleotide omission. Using this assay, we determined that the dissociation of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme follows a first order decay with a half-life of 2.5 min. The long half-life resembles that expected for the holoenzyme processively synthesizing DNA on the leading strand of the replication fork. The holoenzyme dissociation rate is independent of polymerase accessory protein concentration and of ATP hydrolysis. The dissociation rate is increased if the gene 32 protein is omitted or if the primer-template region is shortened from 46 to 28 base pairs. But the rate of holoenzyme dissociation is most strikingly increased when the circular DNA template is converted to a linear form. By analogy with other well studied systems, these results support a model in which ATP hydrolysis by the 44/62 proteins serves to load a ring-like 45 protein onto the DNA. Once loaded, the 45 protein, possibly along with the 44/62 complex, acts as a sliding clamp that tethers the DNA polymerase to the template."

The native enzyme can be resolved into apoenzyme and NAD+ by acidic ammonium sulfate precipitation. The catalytic activity can be reconstituted with the addition of NAD+ to the apoenzyme. Optimum pH range for enzyme activity is broad, between 5.5 and 9.5. It exhibits a temperature optimum at 42 degrees C. The Km and Vmax for the substrate is 0.1 mM and 46 mumol 30 min-1 mg-1, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1589802213,"The ouabain-resistant cell line H1C1 displays a 30-fold differential of reduced sensitivity to the structurally related cardiac glycosides digoxin and digitoxin (Baker, R. M. (1976) in Biogenesis and Turnover of Membrane Macromolecules (Cook, J.S., ed) pp. 93-103, Raven Press, New York). Since these ligand congeners differ only by the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-12 of digoxin we predicted that the H1C1 phenotype must reflect a mutation which alters the binding site of the cardiac glycoside receptor (Na,K-ATPase). Complementary DNA encoding the alpha 1 Na,K-ATPase was prepared from H1C1 cell total RNA by reverse transcription-coupled polymerase chain reaction and these cDNAs were cloned. Sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction clones revealed several independent isolates containing a G > A transition at nucleotide 332 of the propeptide coding sequence, generating the amino acid substitution C108Y. The ability of this substitution to confer differential sensitivity for digoxin and digitoxin was tested and confirmed by expressing a human alpha 1 C108Y-Na,K-ATPase in wild type HeLa cells and assaying for inhibition of cell growth and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity. Phenylalanine or alanine substitutions of this cysteine also confer this pattern of ligand discrimination. Ouabain-resistant Na,K-ATPase substitutions, at positions other than Cys-108 failed to exhibit differential sensitivity indicating that this ligand discrimination is unique to Cys-108 substitutions rather than a general property of cardiac glycoside-resistant mutants. It is proposed that differential resistance of the C108Y receptor for these ligands is a consequence of altering two features of the ligand-receptor interaction; one, a disruption of a common hydrogen bond resulting in general loss of affinity for cardiac glycosides and the other, formation of a new H-bond between the C-12 hydroxyl of digoxin and the receptor, specifically augmenting the stability of this ligand-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1592752245,"We describe the isolation and characterization of a novel mouse gene, tsg24, which displays striking sequence similarities to the Aspergillus nidulans bimE gene. The bimE gene has been shown to be a mitotic checkpoint regulator, negatively regulating entry into mitosis in A. nidulans. The tsg24 gene was found to contain a long open reading frame of 1944 amino acids, encoding a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 216,087 Da. We have developed an antibody directed against the product of the tsg24 gene and identified a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 200 kDa. This protein was found to be uniformly expressed throughout interphase of the cell cycle, whereas the level of this protein was lower in protein extracts prepared from mitotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1537519808,"The porcine uterus synthesizes a proteinase inhibitor (M(r) 14,000) under the influence of progesterone that is relatively specific for plasmin and trypsin, but that also has weak affinity for chymotrypsin. Several isoforms of this uterine plasmin/trypsin inhibitor were purified by a procedure whose final two steps involved affinity chromatography on immobilized chymotrypsin and cation exchange chromatography. Amino-terminal sequencing showed that at least three of the isoforms were closely related. An oligonucleotide probe based on the protein sequence was used to identify a cDNA that contained an open reading frame coding for a mature protein (M(r) 10,295) of 93 amino acids. The inhibitor had a well defined, but unique, Kunitz domain of 64 residues at its amino terminus that shared 67% sequence identity to bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Its P1 residue was arginine rather than lysine. Northern analysis showed the presence of a single mRNA species (700 bases) that in adult female pigs appeared to be confined to the uterus. During pregnancy, UPTI mRNA expression was high until Day 30 and decreased significantly thereafter. By contrast, uteroferrin mRNA reached maximal concentrations in late pregnancy. These data are consistent with an earlier hypothesis that the inhibitor serves to neutralize the activities of one or more serine proteinases generated by the proliferating trophoblast during the formation of the noninvasive placenta of the pig."
https://openalex.org/W1517893224,"Potentiation of initial signal transduction events through the cross-linking of the B cell antigen receptor complex appears to be dependent upon the association of membrane immunoglobulin (mIg) with Ig alpha and Ig beta. We made two groups of mutations within the COOH terminus of mIgM substituting: 1) the spacer, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains and 2) the NH2-terminal 2-8 amino acids within the transmembrane domain (NLWTTAST). We then evaluated the ability of the mutated receptors to associate with Ig alpha and Ig beta and to initiate signal transduction events (Ca2+ mobilization and phosphorylation by tyrosine protein kinases) after cross-linking mIgM receptors. Mutant mIgM receptors containing substitutions of gamma 2b (spacer, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains), AA for TT, and AAAAA for TTAST bound Ig alpha and Ig beta and initiated signal transduction events after mIgM receptor cross-linking. However, substitutions of I-A alpha (spacer, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains) or TTVVCALGL for NLWTTAST blocked association of Ig alpha and Ig beta and initiation of signal transduction events. Results indicate that residues within the first 8 amino acids of the transmembrane domain other than TTAST are necessary for receptor function and association with Ig alpha and Ig beta."
https://openalex.org/W1585684551,"Centromere protein B (CENP-B) is a common centromere DNA-binding protein among mammalian centromeres. CENP-B possesses the specific DNA binding activity to the 17-base pair sequence dispersed in centromeric repetitive DNA sequences. In the previous study, we have shown that its DNA-binding domain exists within the N-terminal 134 amino acid residues. Here, to clarify the whole domain structure, another functional unit required for CENP-B self-association was examined. Recombinant CENP-B was expressed in Escherichia coli. First, a chemical cross-linking reagent, disuccinimidyl suberate, was used to fix the physical association without losing the DNA-binding activity. The complexes with the same molecular weight as homodimer and trimer were identified after a separation by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. With a series of CENP-B deletion constructs, the area responsible for this oligomer formation was located at the internal region. Second, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was also used to survey the minimum regions required for the CENP-B self-association. Three separate elements were identified by assaying the capacity to form the additional slow-migrating complex, two in the internal region and one in the C terminus. These results suggest that CENP-B molecules interact with each other at the multiple sites to fold the centromeric DNA repeats into a heterochromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1527680392,"The human gene for the replication-unlinked histone protein H2A.X is a naturally occurring chimera that contains a replication-unlinked promoter yet produces a stemloop mRNA characteristic of replication-linked histone genes. Consistent with the latter attribute, the H2A.X gene was found to lack introns. The promoter of the H2A.X gene was localized to a 120-base pair region upstream of the transcription start site, a region which included a TATA and two CCAAT sequence elements. The proximal of the two CCAAT elements was shown to be an important determinant of H2A.X gene promoter activity. In a comparative study with the CCAAT elements from the replication-linked H2A.1a gene and the replication-unlinked H2A.Z gene, the proximal CCAAT element of the H2A.X gene was found to bind nuclear factors also bound by CCAAT elements in the latter but not in the former. The specificity of the replication-unlinked H2A.X and H2A.Z gene promoters for CCAAT-binding transcription factors appeared to also reside in short homologous sequences about 10 base pairs away on either side of the CCAAT sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1501766320,"The corepressor-binding domain of the Escherichia coli purine repressor (PurR) is homologous with several periplasmic sugar-binding proteins. Four amino acids in PurR were investigated for a role in binding of corepressors. Three of the residues, Asp146, Arg196 and Asp275, are conserved in periplasmic binding proteins for ribose, glucose/galactose, and arabinose and function to bind sugars. A fourth amino acid, Trp147, required for corepressor binding to PurR, corresponds to residues in glucose/galactose, ribose, and arabinose that also have a role in sugar binding. The four mutations that were constructed perturbed the binding of both hypoxanthine and guanine thus providing evidence for a single corepressor site/PurR subunit. The decreased corepressor binding affinity resulted in reduced affinity of mutant repressors for operator DNA in vitro and decreased capacity for repression in vivo. The corepressor-binding site in PurR appears to be similar to the conserved ligand-binding sites in the three periplasmic sugar-binding proteins and in the LacI family of repressors."
https://openalex.org/W1543610712,"Abstract We constructed tandem cDNA by linking the 5' end of a delayed rectifier-type (Kv1.2) clone to the 3' end of a transient-type (Kv1.4) K+ channel clone. Fusion genes were also constructed, consisting of Kv1.4 and mutants of Kv1.2, which have a single amino acid substitution in the S4-S5 loop. From electrophysiological characterization, it is likely that two pairs of tandem heterodimer constructs can form hybrid channels. In addition, it has been revealed that the wild-type hybrid channel shows a time constant of inactivation very similar to that observed in the homotetrameric Kv1.4 channel. Difference of inactivation kinetics between wild-type and mutant hybrid K+ channels suggests that not only the S4-S5 loop of Kv1.4 but also that of Kv1.2 can serve as the acceptor sites for the inactivation gates, and that all of four sets of loops should be functional for rapid inactivation. From these results, in the hybrid channels the structure and composition of the acceptor sites could be important factors for determining the rate of inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1536444227,"TFIIA is a general transcription factor that modulates class II transcription initiation in vitro by functionally and physically interacting with TFIID or the derived TATA-binding protein (TBP). TFIIA was previously purified from human, bovine, rat, and yeast sources and has recently been identified in association with TFIID in Drosophila. Here, we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the 12.5-kDa subunit of TFIIA from Drosophila melanogaster (dTFIIA-S) and the identification of a partial dTFIIA-S gene in Drosophila virilis. The deduced amino acid sequence of dTFIIA-S indicates a high degree of homology to the small TFIIA subunit from yeast and to a partial TFIIA-S cDNA identified in rice. A hybrid TFIIA consisting of recombinant dTFIIA-S and the recombinant human TFIIA/alpha gene product mimics natural TFIIA activity in a TBP-dependent DNA binding assay. The promoter complex formed with this hybrid TFIIA depends upon the TATA element and can be efficiently incorporated into a higher order preinitiation complex upon addition of TFIIB. The presence of dTFIIA-S within the TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex was demonstrated using anti-dTFIIA-S antiserum. Finally, the ability of recombinant dTFIIA-S to reconstitute transcriptionally active TFIIA was demonstrated in a well defined human transcription system."
https://openalex.org/W1567346007,"A truncated form of the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase is inactivated by Cu2+ with the formation of two intra-molecular disulfide bonds. The formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-36 and Cys-172 (semioxidized form) results in approximately 50% loss of specific activity because the Km for MgATP is about 10-fold higher. The second disulfide bond is between Cys-184 and Cys-197 and causes further loss of activity. Eight Cys mutants, i.e. C36S, C36A, C42S, C138S, C172S, C184S, C184A, and C197S, were expressed and purified. Kinetic studies suggest that Cys-36 is important for interaction at the nucleotide site because of its hydrophobicity. With Cys-184 mutants, C184S and C184A, tyrosyl phosphorylation of angiotensin II is affected much more than serine kinase activity. The loss of tyrosine kinase activity is related to a lowered activity with Mn2+. With Mn2+, angiotensin II is a competitive inhibitor with respect to seryl kinase activity of C184S. With Mg2+, however, angiotensin II is a noncompetitive inhibitor. We suggest that metal ions influence the conformation of truncated gamma and that the protein substrate binding region containing Cys-184 is important for the dual specificity of this kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1545065615,"Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPDase) catalyzed the debromination of 5-bromo-5,6-dihydrouracil (BrUH2) to uracil at pH 7.7 and 37 degrees C. The debrominating activity of DPDase was increased 5-fold by treatment with H2O2, whereas the dehydrogenating activity was inhibited by this treatment. The time course for increasing the debrominating activity by H2O2 was similar to that for decreasing the dehydrogenating activity. Thus, the relative amounts of debrominating and dehydrogenating activities of DPDase were reciprocally related. H2O2 treatment of DPDase decreased the number of thiol groups reactive with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) from eight/subunit to less than one. The kcat for debromination of BrUH2 by H2O2-treated DPDase (OxDPDase) was 1.9 s-1, which was comparable with kcat for reduction of thymine (2.1 s-1) by DPDase. Even though the debromination of BrUH2 to uracil does not involve a net reduction of BrUH2, NADPH was required for this activity. The reaction of OxDPDase with 5-iodo-5,6-dihydrouracil (IUH2) was more complicated than that with BrUH2. Aerobically, OxDPDase catalyzed the deiodination of IUH2 to uracil and the iodination of NADPH to 5-iodo-6-hydroxy-1,4,6-trihydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. The turnover number for the iodination reaction was enhanced by NaI and had a value of 3.5 s-1 in the presence of 4 mM IUH2 and 50 mM NaI. Anaerobically, OxDPDase catalyzed the above reactions, the deiodination of IUH2 to 5,6-dihydrouracil, and the hydration of NADPH to 6-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. The turnover number for the anaerobic hydration of NADPH was similar to that for the aerobic iodination of NADPH."
