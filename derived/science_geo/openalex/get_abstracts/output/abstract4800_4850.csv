The single product, N-7, N-8-(1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene)-L-arginine (DHCH-arginine) is stable in acidic solutions and in borate buffers (pH 8 to 9). DHCH-Arginine is converted to N-7-adipyl-L-arginine by periodate oxidation. The structures of the two compounds were elucidated by chemical and physicochemical means. Arginine or arginyl residues can be regenerated quantitatively from DHCH-arginine by incubation at 37 degrees in hydroxylamine buffer at pH 7.0 FOR 7 TO 8 hours. Analysis of native egg white lysozyme and native as well as oxidized bovine pancreatic RNase, which were treated with cyclohexanedione, showed that only arginine residues were modified. The utility of the method in sequence studies was shown on oxidized bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A. Arginine modification was complete in 2 hours at 35 degrees in borate buffer at pH 9.0 with a 15-fold molar excess of the reagent. The derived peptides showed that tryptic hydrolysis was entirely limited to peptide bonds involving lysine residues, as shown both by two-dimensional peptide patterns and by isolation of the resulting peptides. The stability of DHCH-arginyl residues permits isolation of labeled peptides."

https://openalex.org/W1491886695,"Rat lung homogenates contained significant amounts of guanylate cyclase activity in both 100,000 times g (60 min) particulate and supernatant fractions. In the presence of detergent, the particulate fraction contained 40% as much activity as did the supernatant fraction. Detergent-dispersed particulate and partially purified soluble guanylate cyclase preparations were characterized with respect to divalent cation requirements, divalent cation interactions, kinetic behavior, and gel filtration profiles. Both soluble and particulate guanylate cyclases required divalent cation for activity. The soluble preparation was 10 times more active in the presence of Mn-2plus than in the presence of Mg-2plus or Ca-2plus and no detectable activity was seen with Ba-2plus or Sr-2plus. Particulate guanylate cyclase activity was detectable only in the presence of Mn-2plus. Both enzyme preparations required Mn-2plus in excess of GTP for optimal activity at subsaturating amounts of GTP. At near-saturating GTP, the soluble enzyme required excess Mn-2plus, but the particulate enzyme did not. For kinetic analyses the enzymes were considered to require two substrates: metal-GTP and Me-2plus. Apparent negative cooperative behavior was seen with the soluble enzyme when excess Mn-2plus (in excess of GTP) was varied from 0.01 to 0.2 mM; above 0.2 mM excess Mn-2plus classical kinetic behavior was seen with an apparent KMn-2plus of 0.2 mM at near-saturating MnGTP. Similar studies using the particulate preparation yielded only classical kinetic behavior, but the apparent KMn-2plus decreased to near zero when MnGTP was near-saturating. Kinetic patterns for the particulate and soluble enzymes also differed when reciprocal initial velocities were plotted as a function of reciprocal MnGTP concentrations; classical kinetic behavior was seen with the soluble enzyme with an apparent KMnGTP of about 12 muM (at near-saturating excess Mn-2plus), whereas apparent positive cooperative behavior was seen with the particulate preparation (Hill coefficient equals 1.6, S0.5 EQUALS 70 MUM. Ca-2plus activation of soluble guanylate cyclase was related to the Mn-2plus:GTP ratio. Activation was most apparent when saturating amounts of Mn-2plus and MnGTP. At relatively high concentrations of Ca-2plus (0.1 to 4 mM), the addition of 10 muM Mn-2plus resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in soluble guanylate cyclase activity. In contrast, Ca-2plus sharply inhibited particulate guanylate cyclase activity. Gel filtration profiles of particulate and soluble preparations indicated differences in physical properties of the enzymes. As estimated by gel filtration, particulate (detergent-dispersed)evels. Here, removal of renal tissue is contraindicated. In all renal hy"
https://openalex.org/W1530591019,"Factor VII purified as previously described, was found to consist of two polypeptide chains joined by disulfide bridges. We now report the isolation and 200,000-fold purification of a single chain form of Factor VII. This was accomplished by protecting the molecule against proteolysis by including benzamidine during the entire purification. The purification was essentially as previously reported except that barium cirtate was substituted for barium sulfate as an absorbant for Factor VII as it resulted in a 4-fold increase in yield. Single chain Factor VII is rapidly hydrolyzed by Factor Xa in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipids, and by thrombin, to a two-chain form which possesses at least 85 times the Factor VII clotting activity of the single chain species. The two-chain form of the enzyme requires tissue factor in order to activate Factor X. From the observed rates of activation of Factor VII by Xa in the presence of calcium ions and phospholipids, it was calculated that at approximately physiological concentration, Factor VII activity would increase at an initial rate of 20-fold per min; this reaction is sufficiently rapid to constitute a feedback control mechanism. The action of thrombin is approximately 40-fold slower under these conditions. Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate inactivates the single chain and two-chain forms of Factor VII at approximately equal rates. After inhibition, the single chain species could be cleaved but not activated by proteolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1589635064,"The microsomal enzyme system from rat liver which catalyzes squalene epoxidation requires a supernatant protein and phospholipids (Tai, H., and Bloch, K. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 3767). It has now been found that these two cytoplasmic components can be replaced by Triton X-100. The same detergent solubilizes the microsomal squalene epoxidase and the resulting supernatant can be separated into two components, A and B, by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Neither Fraction A nor B alone has significant squalene epoxidase activity but combining the two affords a reconstituted system 5-fold higher in specific epoxidase activity than that of the original microsomes. FAD and Triton X-100 in addition to molecular oxygen and NADPH are required in the reconstituted system. Subjecting Fraction A to a second DEAE-cellulose chromatography does not change its specific activity but lowers NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity and the protoheme content to 1/25 and 1/4, respectively. When Fraction B was chromatographed on Sephadex G-200, the specific epoxidase activity tested in the presence of Fraction A was increased 3-fold. This procedure also raised the specific activity of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity in Fraction B 3-fold. The reconstituted epoxidase system is not inhibited by either carbon monoxide, potassium cyanide, or o-phenanthrolien but Tiron at 1 mM was inhibitory (50%). Erythrocuprein has no effect on epoxidation. No evidence has been found for the participation of hemoproteins (P450 or cytochrome b5) in squalene epoxidation. Component B appears to be identical with the flavoprotein NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. Component A may be a flavoprotein with an easily dissociable prosthetic group."
https://openalex.org/W1514403515,"A glycosidase which attacks corneal keratan sulfate was purified from extracts of Pseudomonas sp. IFO-13309. When corneal keratan sulfate was degraded by the purified enzyme, Sephadex G-50 chromatography indicated the presence of a number of oligosaccharides differing in size and sulfate content. The characterization of two major fractions of the oligosaccharides indicated that the point of enzyme attack is limited to the endo-beta-D-galactoside bonds in which nonsulfated D-galactose residues participate. The enzyme, unlike ordinary exo-beta-D-galactosidases, did not catalyze the hydrolysis of phenyl beta-D-galactoside. Moreover, beta-D-galactosyl-(1 leads to 3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucosyl-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1 leads to 4)-D-glucose (lacto-N-tetraose) was completely refractory to the action of this enzyme, suggesting that a structure of the type, X-(1 leads to 3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1 leads to 4)-Y, is not the only specificity-determining factor, i.e. neighboring sugars, X and Y, or even larger portions of substrate molecule must have an important effect. Compared with corneal keratan sulfate, keratan sulfates from human nucleus pulposus and shark cartilage were attacked at lower rates with a resultant production of oligosaccharides of relatively large size. The result is in agreement with the view that considerable variations exist in the structure of keratan sulfates of different origin, and further suggests that the enzyme may serve as a useful reagent in studying these variations."
https://openalex.org/W1510367532,"The oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to protoporphyrin IX in yeast cells is enzyme-dependent. The enzyme, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, associated with purified mitochondria isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was solubilized by sonic treatment in the presence of detergent and partially purified. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 180,000 plus or minus 18,000. The purified preparation could be stored at -20 degrees in the presence of 20% glycerol for several months without loss of activity. Enzyme activity was destroyed by heating above 40 degrees and by proteolytic digestion and irreversible inactivation occurred outside the pH range of 4.0 to 9.5. The pH optimum of the enzymic reaction was 7.45 and the value of the Michaelis constant was approximately 4.8 muM. Protoporphyrinogen oxidase did not catalyse the oxidation of coproporphyrinogen I or III or uroporphyrinogen I or III and the rate of enzymic oxidation of mesoporphyrinogen IX was less than 20% of that observed with protoporphyrinogen IX. The presence of thiol groups in the enzyme system was indicated but no metal ion or other cofactor requirement was demonstrated. Enzyme activity was insensitive to cyanide, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and azide whereas it was inhibited in the presence of Cu-2+ or Co-2+ ions, high ionic strength, heme, or hemin."
https://openalex.org/W1577185738,"The cross-linking of the two components of lactose synthetase, alpha-lactalbumin and a galactosyltransferase, with dimethylpimelimidate was examined. The extent of the cross-linking at pH 8.1 was found to be dependent upon the presence of substrates or inhibitors for the galactosyltransferase. N-acetylglucosamine and mixtures of either N-acetylglucosamine, Mn-2+ and UDP, or UDP-galactose and Mn-2+ promoted the formation of cross-linked species. Glucose or a mixture of UDP and Mn-2+ were much less effective in promoting cross-linking. Two types of intermolecularly cross-linked species of alpha-lactalbumin and the galactosyltransferase were obtained. Each was a 1:1 cross-linked complex of alpha-lactalbumin and either of the two forms of the transferase with molecular weights of about 42,000 and 48,000, respectively. Cross-linked complexes were not observed with more than 1 molecule each of alpha-lactalbumin and the transferase. The cross-linked complexes were obtained in homogeneous form by gel filtration on Sephadex and absorption of uncross-linked enzyme by affinity chromatography on alpha-lactalbumin-Sepharose in the presence of N-acetylglucosamine. They migrated on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate with mobilities in accord with their predicted molecular weights as 1:1 complexes of alpha-lactalbumin and the transferase. The amino acid composition of the cross-linked complex was in reasonable agreement with the expected composition of a 1:1 mixture of alpha-lactalbumin and galactosyltransferase. The enzymic properties of the cross-linked and uncross-linked enzymes were compared. The cross-linked complex had a much higher intrinsic lactose synthetase activity than did uncross-linked enzyme although only about 1% of the potential activity of uncross-linked enzyme in the presence of optimal concentrations of alpha-lactalbumin. The lactose synthetase activity of the cross-linked complex, however, was unaffected by exogenous alpha-lactalbumin. In addition, the complex readily catalyzed the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to xylose in the absence of exogenous alpha-lactalbumin. The N-acetyllactosamine synthetase activity of the complex was low compared to its activity with other monosaccharides. Ovalbumin, which is a good acceptor for the uncross-linked transferase, was not an acceptor for the cross-linked complex. Kinetic studies of the complex suggest that its modified catalytic activity is not the result of the modification by dimethylpimelimidate but reflects the expected effects of is provided, and that"
https://openalex.org/W1593802114,"The normal and differential titration curves of liganded and unliganded hemoglobin were measured at various KCl concentrations (0.1 to 2.0 M). In this range of KCl concentrations, the curves for deoxyhemoglobin showed no salt-induced pK changes of titratable groups. In the same salt concentration range oxyhemoglobin showed a marked change in titration behavior which could only be accounted for by a salt-induced increase in pK of some titratable groups. These results show that the suppression of the alkaline Bohr effect by high concentrations of neutral univalent salt is not caused by a weakening of the salt bridges in deoxyhemoglobin but is due to an interaction of chloride ions with oxyhemoglobin. Measurements of the Bohr effect at various KCl concentrations showed that at low chloride ion concentration (5 times 10-3 M) the alkaline Bohr effect is smaller than at a concentration of 0.1 M. This observation indicates that at a chloride ion concentration of 0.1 M, part of the alkaline Bohr effect is due to an interaction of chloride ions with hemoglobin. Furthermore, at low concentrations of chloride ions the acid Bohr effect has almost vanished. This result suggests that part of the acid Bohr effect arises from an interaction of chloride ions with oxyhemoglobin. The dependence of the Bohr effect upon the chloride ion concentration can be explained by assuming specific binding of chloride ions to both oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, with deoxyhemoglobin having the highest affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1508322860,"Homogenates of several mammalian tissues were measured by radioimmunoassay for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase activity. Two types of enzyme activity were detected. One, which used NAD-plus as cofactor much more effectively than NADP-lus, was found in monkey lung, heart, liver, kidney, and spleen and in chicken heart and dog lung. A second type, which uses NADP-plus as a cofactor more effectively than NAD-plus, was found in monkey and human brain and red blood cells and in swine kidney. These two types of 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase were partially purified from monkey brain and chicken heart. In addition to different cofactor requirements, the two partially purified enzymes could be distinguished by chromatographic properties, their relative affinities for prostaglandin I2 and F2alpha, and their sensitivities to inhibition by reduced pyridine nucleotides, thyroid hormones, and prostaglandin B2."
https://openalex.org/W1512114584,"The properties of human methemoglobin have been investigated under a wide variety of conditions to determine its conformation and to test for evidence of the T state conformation which has been proposed by Perutz to exist in the presence of high spin ligands and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP). Subunit dissociation was measured as a criterion for the T state since marked differences in the tetramer-dimer equilibrium exist for oxyhemoglobin (R state) and deoxyhemoglobin (T state). In the absence of IHP, complexes of methemoglobin with both high spin ligands (water, fluoride) or low spin ligands (azide, cyanide) show extensive dissociation in 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2-nitriloethanol buffers, pH 6, 0.1 M NaCl, with values of the tetramer-dimer dissociation constant (K4,2) near 10-5 M. The addition of IHP lowers K4,2 to a value near 10-5 M for all forms of methemoglobin. Combination of IHP with methemoglobin promotes a conformational change, but the change is apparently independence of spin state. The conformation acquired in the presence of IHP is not identical with the T state (K4,2 similar to 10-12 M) and can also occur with hemoglobin in the ferrous form, as revealed by a substantial reduction in K4,2 for CO-hemoglobin upon addition of IHP. Subunit dissociation has also been measured using the haptoglobin reaction, since haptoglobin binds only to hemoglobin dimers. The haptoglobin experiments give results that are qualitatively in agreement with the conclusions reached by ultracentrifuge measurements. Similar results are also obtained by estimating the degree of dissociation on the basis of the material which aggregates following mixing with dithionite. The effect of IHP on azide-binding kinetics with methemoglobin has also been examined. Changes in reactivity is observed upon addition of IHP, but the principal effect is observed upon addition of IHP, but the principal effect is an enhancement of the rate of reaction of the beta chains. Changes in the reactivity of the beta93 sulfhydryl group of methemoglobin also accompany addition of IHP, but in a manner which is largely independent of the spin state of the iron. Similar changes are again found with CO-hemoglobin upon addition of IHP. The rate of binding of bromthymol blue also shows some changes upon addition of IHP, but the changes are more pronounced for deoxyhemoglobin than for methemoglobin. Since the results obtained did not appear to indicate a significant role for spin state in the changes observed, additional studies were undertaken using EPR spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1566637079,"Prenyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.1) has been purified to homogeneity from the supernatant fraction of yeast by ammonium sulfate fractionation, diethylaminoethyl-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography, and column isoelectric focusing techniques. The active enzyme from isoelectric focusing columns emerged as a single symmetrical peak with specific activities 15- to 35-fold higher than previously reported preparations. The enzyme was found to be homogeneous by continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.4 and discontinuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 6.9 as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis at pH 7.0. By means of gel chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the protein was shown to be a dimer with a molecular weight of 84,000 plus or minus 10%. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was determined to be 5.3. The enzyme synthesizes farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates from dimethylallyl, geranyl, and farnesyl pyrophosphates. Michaelis constants for the enzyme were 4, 8, and 14 mu M for isopentenyl, dimethylallyl, and geranyl pyrophosphates, respectively."

One cellulase is buffer-soluble, the other buffer-insoluble but extractable with high salt concentrations. Both enzymes catalyze endohydrolysis of carboxymethylcellulose with the same pH optimum (5.5 to 6.0). They were purified with the use of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex gel filtration, and ultrafiltration. They are distinct proteins as characterized by: electrofocusing and disc gel electrophoresis (pI values = 5.2 and 6.9, respectively); mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, fractionation on Sephadex, and sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge (mol wt = approximately 20,000 and 70,000, S values 2.63 and 3.73); and immunological properties. The buffer-soluble enzyme tends to dimerize on purification. Amino acid analyses show that the buffer-soluble enzyme is relatively rich in glycine, alanine, and valine and deficient in cystine, tryosine, and phenylalanine compared to the buffer-insoluble enzyme. The two cellulase activities were generated in approximately equal amounts after auxin treatment. Within 5 days their levels had increased at least 100-fold and they constituted about 0.1% of total cellular protein. Present data indicate that one is not derived from the other."
https://openalex.org/W1559888350,"Pulsed Fourier transform proton magnetic resonance was used to study alpha-ketoglutaramic, and several other alpha-keto acids in aqueous solutions as a function of pH. Most alpha-keto acids were found to exist in equilibrium with the hydrate (gem-doil). The equilibrium position favors the nonhydrated alphs-keto acid at neutral pH, but at low pH values (below the pKa of the alpha-carboxylic acid group) the hydrate predominates. We found evidence that alpha-ketoglutaric acid exists in a third equilibrium form which is assigned to the lactol. alpha-Ketoglutaramic acid (the alpha-keto acid analog of glutamine) which is known to exist predominantly in a cyclic form at pH 7.0 was shown to exist as a cyclic structure over a wide pH range. However, the cyclic form is an equilibrium mixture of 2-pyrrolidone-5-hydroxy-5-carboxylic and 1-pyrrolin-2-one-5-carboxylic acids."

https://openalex.org/W1574234279,"Circular dichroism spectra for C3a anaphylatoxins (protein fragments generated enzymatically in serum during activation of the third component of complement (C3)) from human and porcine sources were compared in the region of 190 to 250 nm. The spectra were indistinguishable in this region, although an estimated difference of approximately 20% exists between the primary structures of human and porcine C3a. Calculations indicated a total of 40 to 45% alpha helical content based on either the 208 or 222 nm extremum of the CD spectra. Addition of either mercaptoethanol or 6 M guanidinium chloride to human C3a produced a marked decrease in the mean residue ellipticity centered at 222 nm without irreversibly affecting the biological activity. Simultaneous addition of mercaptoethanol and guanidinium chloride virtually eliminated the CD contribution at 222 nm and resulted in more than 90% inactivation of the anaphylatoxin. Removal of the denaturant and reducing agent restored both the biological activity and the CD spectrum of C3a. Heat treatment or reduction and alkylation of human C3a produced biologically inactive and conformationally modified anaphylatoxin. In contrast, C3a inactivated by enzymatic removal of the COOH-terminal arginyl residue was structurally unchanged as judged by CD measurements. Consequently, it is proposed that in addition to the essential COOH-terminal arginyl residue, a highly ordered conformation is required for biological functionality of the C3a molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1584470405,"Mn2+ and to some degree Fe2+, but not Mg+, Ca2+, ba2+, Sr2+, Co2+, Ni2+, La3+, or Fe3+ were able to serve as effective metal cofactors for sea urchin sperm guanylate cyclase. The apparent Michaelis constant for Mn2+ in the presence of 0.25 mM MnGTP was 0.23 mM. In the presence of a fixed free mn2+ concentration, variation in mngTP resulted in sigmoid velocity-substrate plots and in reciprocal plots that were concave upward. These positive cooperative patterns were observed at both pH 7.0 and 7.8 and in the presence or absence of Triton X-100. When Mn2+ and GTP were equimolar, Ca2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, and Mg2+ increased apparent guanylate cyclase activity. This increase in enzyme activity at least could be accounted for partially by an increase in free Mn2+ concentration caused by the complex formation of GTP with the added metals. However, even at relatively low GTP concentrations and with Mn2+ concentrations in excess of GTP, Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+ significantly increased guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate production. As the total GTP concentration was increased, the degree of stimulation in the presence of Ca2+ decreased, despite maintenance of a fixed total concentration of Ca2+ and a fixed free concentration of Mn2+, suggesting that the concentration of CaGTP and MnGTP were determining factors in the observed response. The concave upward reciprocal plots of velocity against MnGTP concentration were changed to linear plots in the presence of CaGTP or SrGTP. These results suggest that sea urchin sperm guanylate cyclase contains multiple nucleotide binding sites and that stimulation of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate synthesis by Ca2+, Sr2+, and perhaps other metals may reflect interaction of a metal-GTP complex with enzyme as either an effector or a substrate."

In contrast, guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase obtained from the same organism is totally inactive in this role and phosphorylates different, mainly seryl and some threonyl, residues of acceptor proteins. Substrates of the latter kinase intimately involved in the regulation of biological processes have remained unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1602669267,"The specific activity of glutamine synthetase in cultured Chinese hamster cells is inversely related to the concentration of glutamine in the surrounding solution. Enzyme specific activity increases 8- to 10-fold when glutamine is removed from serum-free F12 growth media. The induction of glutamine synthetase activity occurs only after glutamine removal and not after the removal of other amino acids (methionine, leucine, or isoleucine). The analysis of the glutamine-mediated decrease in glutamine synthetase activity has been simplified by the finding that depression proceeds in nutrient-free buffered saline solution (141 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl and 30 mM Tricine (pH 7.4). Under these conditions, 0.1 mM cyanide blocks glutamine-mediated depression. The cyanide inhibition is reversed by the addition of 1.0 mM glucose which suggests that ATP is required for depression. Glutamine-mediated depression is temperature-dependent, occurring between 25 and 45 degrees with an optimum rate at 37 degrees. Studies of the time course of induction and depression as a function of glutamine concentration suggest that glutamine regulates the rate at which the enzyme is either modified or degraded. We have employed an antibody prepared against homogeneous Chinese hamster liver glutamine synthetase to measure the amount of glutamine synthetase protein in extracts of cells containing induced or depressed levels of enzyme activity. A highly sensitive immunoprecipitation procedure enables quantitation of nanogram amounts of glutamine synthetase protein. Glutamine synthetase in cell extracts containing induced levels of enzyme activity possesses the same molecular specific activity (ratio of activity to antigenicity) as homogeneous Chinese hamster liver glutamine synthetase. The molecular specific activity of glutamine synthetase is almost the same in extracts of cells with depressed levels of enzyme obtained by growth for short (2 hours) and long (24 hours) times in the presence of glutamine. These data suggest that glutamine-mediated depression of glutamine synthetase results from degradation of enzyme molecules."

One enzyme was a dehydrase that converted prostaglandin E to prostaglandin A, the second was a prostaglandin A isomerase that converted prostaglandin A to prostaglandin C and the third was a prostaglandin C isomerase that converted prostaglandin C to prostaglandin B. All three were inactivated by sulfhydryl blocking agents. In human serum, only prostaglandin C isomerase had high activity, whereas the two other enzymes had very low activity. In rabbit serum both isomerases were very active, but dehydrase activity could not be detected. Prostaglandin C isomerase activity was also found in crystallized human serum albumin and rabbit serum albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1572358248,"Tables of protonic activity (paH) of a number of buffers, determined in mixed solvents and at subzero temperatures, are reported for the following media: water-1,2-propanediol, water-glycerol, and water-dimethylsulfoxide (50:50, in volume). These data with those previously reported allowed us to study enzymic reactions under these conditions. The paH dependence of the tryptic hydrolysis of benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester has been studied in the presence of organic solvents (methanol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propanediol, glycerol, and dimethylsulfoxide, all 50% by volume) between 20 and -20 degrees. The results have allowed us to show the validity of our paH scales in mixed solvents. The paH profiles obtained under these conditions are similar to those observed in pure water at 20 degrees. They are shifted nevertheless by both solvent and temperature. Such shifts are interpreted in terms of the effects of solvents and temperature on pKES on the basis of the conclusions drawn from a study of the effect of these variables on small dissociable molecules. The results obtained under these conditions of solvents and temperature are consistent with the presence at the active site of the enzyme of a histidine residue, and thus provide, concerning the solvent effect, a direct verification of the method of Findlay et al. (Findlay, D., Mathias, A. P., and Rabin, B. R. (1962) Biochem. J. 85, 139-144). On the other hand, the large temperature interval provided by the low temperature procedure, allows us to vary significantly the pK of ionizable groups of the enzymes and thus makes possible their identification, on the basis of their enthalpy of ionization."
https://openalex.org/W1528151750,"Abstract Housefly microsomes contain two spectrally different forms of cytochrome P-450 which we have termed P-450 and P-450I. Methods have been developed for the fractionation and chromatographic purification of these two hemoprotein forms. Microsomes are solubilized first with Triton X-100 in the presence of glycerol, dithiothreitol, ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and phenobarbital. Cytochrome P-450 is recovered in a floating pellet after the addition of 25% ammonium sulfate followed by centrifugation, whereas cytochrome P-450I remains in the 25% ammonium sulfate supernatant fluid. Cytochrome P-450 is purified further by Sephadez G-200 and DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column chromatography, which also allows the isolation of cytochrome b5 and NADPH-dependent cytochrome P-450 reductase in good yields and with little cross-contamination. Cytochrome P-450 apparently is free of cytochromes b5 and P-420 as well as of reductase and is obtained in a final yield of approximately 16% with a 6.9-fold purification. Its maximum absorbance is at 45 mn in the CO-difference spectrum and its average extinction coefficient is 103 cm-1 nm-1. Cytochrome P-450I is purified by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography but still contains some cytochromes b5 and P-420 as well as reductase. Its maximum absorbance is at 448.5 nm in the CO-difference spectrum and its extinction coefficient is 83 to 86 cm-1 mM-1. Both cytochromes hydroxylate type I substrates such as aminopyrine. Sufficient amounts of reductase are present in the cytochrome P-450I preparation to sustain activity, but the reductase has to be added to cytochrome P-450 in a reconstituted system for activity. Cytochrome P-450 is fairly stable, whereas cytochrome P-450I can be isolated only when protected by a substrate (phenobarbital). Detergent-solubilized housefly cytochromes P-450 and P-450I seem to correspond to either aggregates or oligomeric proteins. Cytochrome P-450 appears to correspond to a tetramer, each subunit having a molecular weight of 45,000, whereas cytochrome P-450I may correspond to an aggregate of at least 10 subunits. The cytochrome P-450 aggregate is dissociated by 6 M urea, but cytochrome P-450I remains as such."
https://openalex.org/W1565893073,"Abstract In a native protein, the exchange of a peptide amide proton with solvent occurs by one of two pathways, either directly from the folded protein, or via unfolding, exchange taking place from the unfolded protein. From the thermal unfolding rate constants, the contribution of unfolding to the over-all kinetics as a function of solvent and temperature has been determined. Exchange involving unfolding of the protein is characterized by a high activation energy, in the range of 50 to 60 Cal per mol. The activiation energy (Eapp) of the rates of exchange directly from the folded protein is approximately 20 to 25 Cal per mol. Because for the proton transfer step, Eapp approximately equal to 20 Cal per mol, the activation energy for any contributing protein conformational process(es) is approximately equal to 0 to 5 Cal per mol. Most, if not all, of the peptide amide protons in a folded protein can exchange directly with solvent without the protein unfolding. The number of slowly exchanging protons at a given condition of pH and temperature is not related to a discrete structural unit, but rather to the distribution of observed rates within the broader distribution of actual rates. The large attenuation of hydrogen exchange rates in folded proteins, resulting in a distribution of first order rates over 6 orders of magnitude, is primarily due to the effects of restricted solvent accessibility of labile protons in the three-dimensional structure. Any protein conformational process, such as protein fluctuations, invoked to explain the solvent accessibility must be of low activation energy and attenuated by ethanol and other co-solvents (Woodward, C. K., Ellis, L. M., and Rosenberg, A. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 440-444)."
https://openalex.org/W1565594902,"Apo-lactic oxidase from Mycobacterium smegmatis reconstituted with the deazaisoalloxazine analogue of FMN, 5-deazaFMN, undergoes reduction by L-lactate but not catalytic reoxidation by O2. The rate of deazaFMN-holo-enzyme reduction by substrate is 1.1 min-1. With L-[alpha-3-H]-lactate, direct tritium transfer to enzyme-bound deazaFMN occurs during reduction. No evidence for a stable covalent lactate-deazaFMN adduct has been obtained. The deaza-FMNH2-enzyme is reoxidized extremely slowly by O2, consistent with the sluggish nonenzymatic reaction of deaza-FMNH2 with oxygen. On the other hand, addition of pyruvate to the deazaFMNH2-enzyme causes rapid reoxidation, a process not detected in the absence of enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1556852774,"Isoproterenol stimulates cellular accumulation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and produces a 2- to 4-fold increase in bidirectional potassium fluxes in turkey erythrocytes. Ouabain, which does not alter catecholamine-stimulated cellular cyclic AMP, inhibits potassium influx by 50 to 70%, does not alter potassium outflux or isoproterenol-stimulated potassium influx, but increases isoproterenol-stimulated potassium outflux. Stimulation of potassium transport by isoproterenol can be reproduced by adding cyclic AMP to the medium and is inhibited by propranolol or dichloroisoproterenol but not by phentolamine. Theophylline at concentrations which inhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in isolated turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes by greater than 90%, does not augment isoproterenol stimulation of cellular cyclic AMP or of potassium transport but does potentiate stimulation of potassium influx produced by adding cyclic AMP to the medium. Isoproterenol-stimulated cellular cyclic AMP increases steadily for at least 2 hours. Potassium transport, however, increases rapidly, becomes maximal after 20 to 30 min of incubation, and thereafter decreases progressively so that after 2 hours of incubation potassium fluxes are only slightly greater than for the control. Ouabain prolongs the duration of catecholamine-stimulated potassium influx and potassium outflux, reflecting its ability to relieve the refractoriness developed by turkey erythroyctes to endogenous cyclic AMP."

Biol. Chem. (1971) 246, 517-522) In 2, 2'2'' nitriloethanol buffer the fraction of oxidized material represented by the beta chains decreases with decreasing extent of total oxidation, of the alpha chains. Upon addition of insitol hexaphosphate, the degree of perferntial oxidation in terms of a two-state model similar to the description of oxygenation by Edelstein (nature(1971) 230, 224-227) but with the incorporation of chain heterogeneity. The results indicate that the pH-dependent cooperativity of the oxidation-reduction reaction can be described in terms of a bell curbe of n versus log l, the allosteric somewhat lower and shifted slightly to the left, due in part to an affnity of beta chains for electrons approximately twince that of alpha chains. Because the curve is shifted to the left, oxidation-reduction equilibria at l values corresponding to pH 6 to lie on the right side of the bell curve where cooperativity the preferntial affity of beta chains for electrons rises to about 4 times that of alpha chains. As a consequence, the coreesponding bell curve is lowered with the Hill coeficient falling to unity or below in the range of l encountered. Thus the principal cause of decreased cooperativity is chain heterogeneity and not stabilization in the t state as suggested by Perutz; under these conditions the molecules of methemoglobin in the t state are only a fractional part of the population."

The reaction requires the presence of Mg-2plus, Mn-2plus, Ca-2lus, or Co-2plus. Kinetics of the reaction with varying Mg-2plus concentrations, keeping the concentration of dCTP constant, suggests that the true substrate of the reaction is MgdCTP. The dependence of the rate of reaction on dCTP concentration in the presnece of 5-fold excess of Mg-2plus is sigmoid, with a Hill coefficient of 1.7. The enzyme is specifically inhibited by dTTP and dUTP. In the presence of increasing dTTP concentrations the sigmoidicity of the substrate saturation curves increases. With 0.2 and 0.4 mM dTTP the Hill coefficients are 2.6 and 3.0, respectively. Despite several attempts no dissociation of the substrate site and the inhibitor site of the enzyme was achieved."

https://openalex.org/W1496528535,"We have investigated the p-chlorophenylalanine-dependent loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in cultured hepatoma cells. The similarity of the effect of p-chlorophenylalanine on phenylalanine hydroxylase in the hepatoma cells and that reported from studies in vivo indicates that the loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is due to a direct interaction of the amino acid analogue with the liver. We can find no evidence that the loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is due to: a direct inactivation of the hydroxylase by p-chlorophenylalanine or an inhibitor produced by p-chlorophenylalanine treatment; an effect similar to that of p-fluorophenylalanine; or leakage of enzyme from the cells during p-chlorophenylalanine treatment. The data presented indicate: (a) the p-chlorophenylalanine effect is rather specific for phenylalanine hydroxylase; (b) following p-chlorophenylalanine removal, new protein synthesis is necessary for restoration of the hydroxylase activity; (c) the rate of loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity after the addition of p-chlorophenylalanine is much faster than the rate of restoration of the hydroxylase activity after removal of p-chlorophenylalanine; (d) even in the presence of p-chlorophenylalanine, hydrocortisone greatly stimulates the hydroxylase activity; (e) the cell density-dependent increase of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity is blocked by p-chlorophenylalanine. A discussion of the possible mechanisms of p-chlorophenylalanine-dependent loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase is presented. To measure very low leanine-dependent loss of phenylalanine hydroxylase is presented. To measure very low levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, a new procedure, based on isotope dilution, was developed for isolating the tyrosine formed during the enzymatic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2157683533,"Measurement of the dissociation constants of ferrihemoglobin by light scattering indicates that the quaternary structure is altered by the type of heme ligand. Fluoromethemoglobin and aquomethemoglobin, high spin derivatives with weak ligands, have tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of 80 and 50 muM, respectively. For low spin cyanmethemoglobin the dissociation constants were 1 muM (pH 6.0) and 3 muM (pH 9.0) under the general conditions of 0.1 ionic strength and 25 degrees. Of the ferrihemoglobins studied, alkaline methemoglobin (pH 9.0) has the lowest dissociation constant (0.2 muM). Dissociation constants of mixtures of alkaline and fluoromethemoglobin were significantly higher than that of the alkaline form alone. At pH 9.0 the 55 and 78% fluoride-bound derivatives had tetramer-dimer dissociation constants of 0.7 and 2 muM, respectively. The cyanmethemoglobin quaternary conformation was found to be less affected by pH than the fluoromethemoglobin and aquomethemoglobin conformations. Measurement of the dissociation constant (0.2 muM) for aquomethemoglobin-inositol hexaphosphate indicates stabilization of the tetramer by this organic phosphate. The extent of stabilization by inositol hexaphosphate does not appear to be that found for deoxyhemoglobin as suggested by Perutz (Perutz, M. F. (1972) Nature 237, 495-499) even though inducement of higher spin and iron-heme plane displacement may occur."
https://openalex.org/W1534215191,"The complex formed when excess regulatory subunits (r2) of aspartate transcarbamylase is added to a dilute solution of the catalytic subunit (c3) has been further studied. By stabilizing the complex with saturating levels or r2, it was possible to perform ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients. The sedimentation coefficient of the complex (7.7 plus or minus 0.2 S) is intermediate between those of the catalytic subunit (5.8 S) and of the native enzyme (11.7 S). Consideration of the likely hydrodynamic properties of the complex suggests that this sedimentation coefficient may be consistent with the c3r6 structure previously proposed. The formation of c3r6 from c3 and r2 is readily reversible. At nonsaturating levels or r2, conversion to the native enzyme (c3r6) takes place. This conversion is inhibited by high concentrations of r2. The c3r6 complex shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a low Km for aspartate and considerable substrate inhibition. The pH activity profile at high aspartate concentrations is almost identical with that of the native enzyme. All of these observations suggest that c3r6 represents the relaxed (R) state of aspartate transcarbamylase. The insensitivity of c3r6 toward CTP or ATP can also be explained by considering c3r6 as a stabilized relaxed state. These properties of c3r6 have significant implications regarding the allosteric mechanism of the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1588989380,"The four components of hemoglobin from the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) have been isolated. The oxygen affinities of the first two components eluted from the DEAE-cellulose column have much smaller pH dependencies than the last two components. These components have very low O2 affinities at low pH. The effect of pH on the equilibrium and kinetics of ligand binding to the third fraction, the pH-dependent component present in greatest amounts, has been studied. Measurements of ligand binding equilibria demonstrate the presence of both an alkaline and an acid Bohr effect. In the region of the alkaline Bohr effect the value of n in the Hill equation is a function of ligand affinity. For CO binding n decreases as the pH is decreased until at pH 6, the minimum ligand affinity is reached. At this pH there is also a complete loss of cooperative ligand binding. Decreasing the pH further results in an increase of ligand affinity, but this acid Bohr effect is not associated with a reappearance of cooperativity. This suggests that Fraction 3 of S. gairdneri is frozen in the low affinity, deoxygenated conformation at low pH and that the quaternary structure does not change even when fully liganded. However, the properties of the low affinity conformation of this hemoglobin are pH-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W1546296257,"The effects of ethanol, ethylene glycol, dioxane, and other organic co-solvents upon the hydrogen exchange rates of randomly coiled oxidized RNase, native RNase, and native trypsin have been measured. The exchange rate of oxidized RNase, the model compound for the proton transfer step in hydrogen exchange, is decreased by all of the co-solvents studied at temperatures in the range 3-20 degrees. This has been ascribed to the combined effects of the disruption of peptide bond solvation due to a reduction in the concentration of water, and of changes in [OH-] ion concentration due to changes in the acid dissociation constant of water, Kw. The solvent dependence for both native RNase and native trypsin is similar in all of the solvents studied. At a low temperature (3-20 degrees), the exchange rates go through a minimum as the solvent concentration is increased. At higher temperatures (20-35 degrees) the exchange rates are increased at all concentrations of the co-solvent. The apparent rate minimum at lower temperatures is due to two opposing effects. Co-solvents decrease the rate of exchange that occurs directly from the folded molecule. At higher concentrations and higer temperature. The decrease in rates for exchange directly from folded protein is primarily due to the effects on the proton transfer step, and not to binding or the solvent effects on protein structure. The solvents used in this study have no apparent effect on conformational processes contributing to the hydrogen exchange process in folded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1580278984,"Mitochondria were isolated from the cellular slime mold. Dictyoostelium discoideum, and partially purified by sucrose density gradient fractionation. The most purified mitochondrial fraction from the gradient contained essentially no contaminating lysosomes and minimal amounts of contaminating peroxisomes as determined by the marker enzymes N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and catalase. A mitochondrial fraction with the same amount of lysosomal and peroxisomal contamination was also isolated from cells which had been treated with ethidium bromide for 5 days. The most purified mitochondrial fraction from control and ethidium bromide-treated cells had an identical buoyant density of 1.181 to 1.182 g per ml, suggesting that treatment with the drug does not result in any drastic structural changes in the mitochondrial membrane which would affect its density. In the purified mitochondria from ethidium bromide-treated cells, the content of cytochromes a-a3 was decreased over 80% and that of cytochrome oxidase and oligomycin sensitive ATPase were reduced approximately 50%. By contrast, the specific activities of NADH and succinate dehydrogenases were identical in the purified mitochondria from control and ethidium bromide-treated cells. Previously, we had reported that the specific activities of these two enzymes had nearly doubled in whole cells maintained in ethidium bromide for a time equivalent to six or seven generations after growth had stopped (Stuchell, R. N., Weinstein, B. I., and Beattie, D. S. (1973) Fed. Eur. Biochem. Coc Lett. 37, 23-26). These results suggest that continued formation of new mitochondrial membranes, with an identical complement of succinate and NADH dehydrogenases, must occur despite the cessation of cell growth which occurs as a result of the ethidium bromide induced loss of mitochondrial enzymes. Consequently, the amount of mitochondria, or mitochondrial protein per cell, calculated from the activity of NADH and succinate dehydrogenases has increased nearly 50%. Possible models to explain the control of mitochondrial biogenesis are discussed to explain these results."

Fluoride, hydroxylamine, and several thiol compounds have now been shown to serve as effective nucleophiles toward the active phosphate and result in the dephosphorylation of phosphoglucomutase. The more extensively studied nucleophiles, cysteine, hydroxylamine, and fluoride, are effective at a concentration as low as 1 mM with a relative reactivity of 40, 2, and 1, respectively. The reaction proceeds as long as the catalytic activity of the enzyme is maintained. Inactivation of the enzyme abolishes dephosphorylation by all nucleophilic reagents thus far studied. The dephosphorylation reaction shows optimal activity of pH 6.5. The rate of dephosphorylation exhibits saturation kinetics. With fluoride the Km is 534 mM. Dephosphorylation by fluoride is stimulated by some but not all bivalent cations. Cu+ and Co2+ are the most effective. Cu2+ not only augments the reaction with fluoride but also facilitates a nucleophilic attack by water, in the absence of the halogen, to yield inorganic phosphate. No augmentation of the rate of dephosphorylation by bivalent cations can be elicited with either cysteine or hydroxylamine. The products of the fluoride reaction are phosphorofluoridate, a small but variable amount of inorganic phosphate, and a fully active dephosphoenzyme. By constrast, cysteine and hydroxylamine yield inorganic phosphate and a partially inactive enzyme. The dephosphorylation rate varies with temperature. Arrhenius plots for the fluoride reaction reveal two distinct slopes. The heat of activation between 5-37 degrees was found to be 10.2 Cal per mol. Between 0-5 degrees, however, it was considerably greater amounting to 24.3 Cal per mol."

https://openalex.org/W1496847537,"Pyridine dinucleotide transhydrogenase of the Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophore membrane was readily resolved by a washing procedure into two inactive components, a soluble transhydrogenase factor protein and an insoluble membrane-bound factor. Transhydrogenation was reconstituted on reassociation of these components. The capacity of the membrane factor to reconstitute enzymatic activity was lost after proteolysis of soluble transhydrogenase factor-depleted membranes with trypsin. NADP+ or NADPH, but neither NAD+ nor NADH, stimulated by several fold the rate of trypsin-dependent inactivation of the membrane factor. Substantial protection of the membrane factor from proteolytic inactivation was observed in the presence of Mg2+ ions, an inhibitor of transhydrogenation, or when the soluble transhydrogenase factor was bound to the membrane. Coincident with the loss of enzymatic reconstitutive capacity of the membrane factor was a loss in the ability of the membranes to bind the soluble transhydrogenase factor in a stable complex. The membrane component was inactivated by preincubating soluble transhydrogenase factor-depleted membranes at temperatures above 45 degrees. NADP+, NADPH, or Mg2+ ions, but neither NAD+ nor NADH, protected against inactivation. These studies indicate that (a) the binding of NADP+ or NADPH to the membrane factor promotes a conformational alteration in the protein such that its themostability and susceptibility to proteolysis are increased, and (b) the inhibitory Mg2+ ion-binding site resides in the membrane component."
https://openalex.org/W1551614144,"An active derivative of staphylococcal nuclease, in which only tyrosine residue 115 has been nitrated with use of tetranitromethane, has been characterized using absorbance, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results show that nitrotyrosine-115 nuclease is indistinguishable from native nuclease with regard to the average secondary structure of the folded polypeptide chain, the susceptibility of the enzyme to heat denaturation, and the local tertiary structure around tryptophan residue 140. Inasmuch as optical properties of nitrotyrosine-115 nuclease from 300 to 500 nm can be unambiguously assigned to nitrotyrosine residue 115 in the active site region, this modified enzyme presents a good model system for studying the circular dichroism properties of this aromatic amino acid in a protein. The spectral properties of nitrotyrosine-115 nuclease have been compared to those of the model compounds, cyclo-(-Gly-Tyr(3NO2)-) and Tyr(3NO2). Circular dichroism spectral changes in nitrotyrosine-115 nuclease due to the binding of deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca-2+ have been compared to the corresponding nitrotyrosyl-115 absorption spectral changes. This comparison shows that the circular dichroism difference spectrum exhibits an over-all change in the intensity of the observed Cotton effects, whereas the absorption difference spectrum exhibits a blue shift. This finding supports the suggestion that perturbations of aromatic amino acid chromophores in proteins due to ligand binding result in red or blue shifts in absorption difference spectra, but in over-all changes of intensity in circular dichroism difference spectra."
