https://openalex.org/W1981820664,"β-Adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) promote brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis by mobilizing fatty acids and inducing the expression of oxidative genes. β-AR activation increases the expression of oxidative genes by elevating cAMP, but whether lipolytic products can modulate gene expression is not known. This study examined the role that adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) plays in the induction of gene expression. Activation of brown adipocytes by β-AR agonism or 8-bromo-cyclic AMP increased the expression of PGC1α, PDK4, PPARα, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR-1), and concurrent inhibition of HSL reduced the induction of PGC1α, PDK4, PPARα, and UCP1 but not NOR-1. Similar results were observed in the BAT of mice following pharmacological or genetic inhibition of HSL and in brown adipocytes with stable knockdown of ATGL. Conversely, treatments that increase endogenous fatty acids elevated the expression of oxidative genes. Pharmacological antagonism and siRNA knockdown indicate that PPARα and PPARδ modulate the induction of oxidative genes by β-AR agonism. Using a live cell fluorescent reporter assay of PPAR activation, we demonstrated that ligands for PPARα and -δ, but not PPARγ, were rapidly generated at the lipid droplet surface and could transcriptionally activate PPARα and -δ. Knockdown of ATGL reduced cAMP-mediated induction of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. Consequently, ATGL knockdown reduced maximal oxidation of fatty acids, but not pyruvate, in response to cAMP stimulation. Overall, the results indicate that lipolytic products can activate PPARα and PPARδ in brown adipocytes, thereby expanding the oxidative capacity to match enhanced fatty acid supply."
https://openalex.org/W2148279352,"Background Insecticide resistance is one of the best examples of rapid micro-evolution found in nature. Since the development of the first synthetic insecticide in 1939, humans have invested considerable effort to stay ahead of resistance phenotypes that repeatedly develop in insects. Aphids are a group of insects that have become global pests in agriculture and frequently exhibit insecticide resistance. The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, has developed resistance to at least seventy different synthetic compounds, and different insecticide resistance mechanisms have been reported worldwide. Methodology/Principal Findings To further characterize this resistance, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptional responses in three genotypes of M. persicae, each exhibiting different resistance mechanisms, in response to an anti-cholinesterase insecticide. The sensitive genotype (exhibiting no resistance mechanism) responded to the insecticide by up-regulating 183 genes primarily ones related to energy metabolism, detoxifying enzymes, proteins of extracellular transport, peptidases and cuticular proteins. The second genotype (resistant through a kdr sodium channel mutation), up-regulated 17 genes coding for detoxifying enzymes, peptidase and cuticular proteins. Finally, a multiply resistant genotype (carrying kdr and a modified acetylcholinesterase), up-regulated only 7 genes, appears not to require induced insecticide detoxification, and instead down-regulated many genes. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests strongly that insecticide resistance in M. persicae is more complex that has been described, with the participation of a broad array of resistance mechanisms. The sensitive genotype exhibited the highest transcriptional plasticity, accounting for the wide range of potential adaptations to insecticides that this species can evolve. In contrast, the multiply resistant genotype exhibited a low transcriptional plasticity, even for the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in insecticide detoxification. Our results emphasize the value of microarray studies to search for regulated genes in insects, but also highlights the many ways those different genotypes can assemble resistant phenotypes depending on the environmental pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2056383319,"Photosynthetic capacity is one of the most sensitive parameters in vegetation models and its relationship to leaf nitrogen content links the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Process understanding for reliably predicting photosynthetic capacity is still missing. To advance this understanding we have tested across C3 plant species the coordination hypothesis, which assumes nitrogen allocation to photosynthetic processes such that photosynthesis tends to be co-limited by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and regeneration. The coordination hypothesis yields an analytical solution to predict photosynthetic capacity and calculate area-based leaf nitrogen content (Na). The resulting model linking leaf photosynthesis, stomata conductance and nitrogen investment provides testable hypotheses about the physiological regulation of these processes. Based on a dataset of 293 observations for 31 species grown under a range of environmental conditions, we confirm the coordination hypothesis: under mean environmental conditions experienced by leaves during the preceding month, RuBP carboxylation equals RuBP regeneration. We identify three key parameters for photosynthetic coordination: specific leaf area and two photosynthetic traits (k3, which modulates N investment and is the ratio of RuBP carboxylation/oxygenation capacity () to leaf photosynthetic N content (Npa); and Jfac, which modulates photosynthesis for a given k3 and is the ratio of RuBP regeneration capacity (Jmax) to). With species-specific parameter values of SLA, k3 and Jfac, our leaf photosynthesis coordination model accounts for 93% of the total variance in Na across species and environmental conditions. A calibration by plant functional type of k3 and Jfac still leads to accurate model prediction of Na, while SLA calibration is essentially required at species level. Observed variations in k3 and Jfac are partly explained by environmental and phylogenetic constraints, while SLA variation is partly explained by phylogeny. These results open a new avenue for predicting photosynthetic capacity and leaf nitrogen content in vegetation models."
https://openalex.org/W2019047431,"Structural changes in human serum albumin (HSA) induced by the pollutants 1-naphthol, 2-naphthol and 8-quinolinol were analyzed by circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. The alteration in protein conformational stability was determined by helical content induction (from 55 to 75%) upon protein-pollutant interactions. Domain plasticity is responsible for the temperature-mediated unfolding of HSA. These findings were compared to HSA-hydrolase activity. We found that though HSA is a monomeric protein, it shows heterotropic allostericity for β-lactamase activity in the presence of pollutants, which act as K- and V-type non-essential activators. Pollutants cause conformational changes and catalytic modifications of the protein (increase in β-lactamase activity from 100 to 200%). HSA-pollutant interactions mediate other protein-ligand interactions, such as HSA-nitrocefin. Therefore, this protein can exist in different conformations with different catalytic properties depending on activator binding. This is the first report to demonstrate the catalytic allostericity of HSA through a mechanistic approach. We also show a correlation with non-microbial drug resistance as HSA is capable of self-hydrolysis of β-lactam drugs, which is further potentiated by pollutants due to conformational changes in HSA."
https://openalex.org/W2022038566,"To evaluate a rapid and cost-effective method for monitoring bacteria in ballast water, several marine bacterial isolates were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Since International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations are concerned with the unintended transportation of pathogenic bacteria through ballast water, emphasis was placed on detecting species of Vibrio, enterococci and coliforms. Seawater samples collected from the North Sea were incubated in steel ballast tanks and the presence of potentially harmful species of Pseudomonas was also investigated. At the genus-level, the identification of thirty six isolates using MALDI-TOF MS produced similar results to those obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No pathogenic species were detected either by 16S rRNA gene analysis or by MALDI-TOF MS except for the opportunistically pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, in house software that calculated the correlation coefficient values (CCV) of the mass spectral raw data and their variation was developed and used to allow the rapid and efficient identification of marine bacteria in ballast water for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W1996392642,"Metastatic renal cancer manifests multiple signatures of gene expression. Deviation in expression of mature miRNAs has been linked to human cancers. Importance of miR-21 in renal cell carcinomas is proposed from profiling studies using tumor tissue samples. However, the role of miR-21 function in causing renal cancer cell proliferation and invasion has not yet been shown. Using cultured renal carcinoma cells, we demonstrate enhanced expression of mature miR-21 along with pre-and pri-miR-21 by increased transcription compared to normal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-21 Sponge to quench endogenous miR-21 levels inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of renal cancer cells. In the absence of mutation in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene, PTEN protein levels are frequently downregulated in renal cancer. We show that miR-21 targets PTEN mRNA 3′untranslated region to decrease PTEN protein expression and augments Akt phosphorylation in renal cancer cells. Downregulation of PTEN as well as overexpression of constitutively active Akt kinase prevented miR-21 Sponge-induced inhibition of renal cancer cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, we show that miR-21 Sponge inhibited the inactivating phosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein tuberin and attenuated TORC1 activation. Finally, we demonstrate that expression of constitutively active TORC1 attenuated miR-21 Sponge-mediated suppression of proliferation and migration of renal cancer cells. Our results uncover a layer of post-transcriptional regulation of PTEN by transcriptional activation of miR-21 to force the canonical oncogenic Akt/TORC1 signaling conduit to drive renal cancer cell proliferation and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2016045705,"Mutation of the staphylococcal accessory regulator (sarA) limits biofilm formation in diverse strains of Staphylococcus aureus, but there are exceptions. One of these is the commonly studied strain Newman. This strain has two defects of potential relevance, the first being mutations that preclude anchoring of the fibronectin-binding proteins FnbA and FnbB to the cell wall, and the second being a point mutation in saeS that results in constitutive activation of the saePQRS regulatory system. We repaired these defects to determine whether either plays a role in biofilm formation and, if so, whether this could account for the reduced impact of sarA in Newman. Restoration of surface-anchored FnbA enhanced biofilm formation, but mutation of sarA in this fnbA-positive strain increased rather than decreased biofilm formation. Mutation of sarA in an saeS-repaired derivative of Newman (P18L) or a Newman saeRS mutant (ΔsaeRS) resulted in a biofilm-deficient phenotype like that observed in clinical isolates, even in the absence of surface-anchored FnbA. These phenotypes were correlated with increased production of extracellular proteases and decreased accumulation of FnbA and/or Spa in the P18L and ΔsaeRS sarA mutants by comparison to the Newman sarA mutant. The reduced accumulation of Spa was reversed by mutation of the gene encoding aureolysin, while the reduced accumulation of FnbA was reversed by mutation of the sspABC operon. These results demonstrate that saeRS and sarA act synergistically to repress the production of extracellular proteases that would otherwise limit accumulation of critical proteins that contribute to biofilm formation, with constitutive activation of saeRS limiting protease production, even in a sarA mutant, to a degree that can be correlated with increased enhanced capacity to form a biofilm. Although it remains unclear whether these effects are mediated directly or indirectly, studies done with an sspA::lux reporter suggest they are mediated at a transcriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2009434058,"Current staging methods such as tumor thickness, ulceration and invasion of the sentinel node are known to be prognostic parameters in patients with malignant melanoma (MM). However, predictive molecular marker profiles for risk stratification and therapy optimization are not yet available for routine clinical assessment.Using tissue microarrays, we retrospectively analyzed samples from 364 patients with primary MM. We investigated a panel of 70 immunohistochemical (IHC) antibodies for cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA mismatch repair, differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion, signaling and metabolism. A marker selection procedure based on univariate Cox regression and multiple testing correction was employed to correlate the IHC expression data with the clinical follow-up (overall and recurrence-free survival). The model was thoroughly evaluated with two different cross validation experiments, a permutation test and a multivariate Cox regression analysis. In addition, the predictive power of the identified marker signature was validated on a second independent external test cohort (n=225). A signature of seven biomarkers (Bax, Bcl-X, PTEN, COX-2, loss of β-Catenin, loss of MTAP, and presence of CD20 positive B-lymphocytes) was found to be an independent negative predictor for overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with MM. The seven-marker signature could also predict a high risk of disease recurrence in patients with localized primary MM stage pT1-2 (tumor thickness ≤2.00 mm). In particular, three of these markers (MTAP, COX-2, Bcl-X) were shown to offer direct therapeutic implications.The seven-marker signature might serve as a prognostic tool enabling physicians to selectively triage, at the time of diagnosis, the subset of high recurrence risk stage I-II patients for adjuvant therapy. Selective treatment of those patients that are more likely to develop distant metastatic disease could potentially lower the burden of untreatable metastatic melanoma and revolutionize the therapeutic management of MM."

https://openalex.org/W1967500040,"Biopharmaceuticals represent the fastest growing sector of the global pharmaceutical industry. Cost-efficient production of these biologic drugs requires a robust host organism for generating high titers of protein during fermentation. Understanding key cellular processes that limit protein production and secretion is, therefore, essential for rational strain engineering. Here, with single-cell resolution, we systematically analysed the productivity of a series of Pichia pastoris strains that produce different proteins both constitutively and inducibly. We characterized each strain by qPCR, RT-qPCR, microengraving, and imaging cytometry. We then developed a simple mathematical model describing the flux of folded protein through the ER. This combination of single-cell measurements and computational modelling shows that protein trafficking through the secretory machinery is often the rate-limiting step in single-cell production, and strategies to enhance the overall capacity of protein secretion within hosts for the production of heterologous proteins may improve productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2015546204,"The chemistry of high-performance magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents remains an active area of research. In this work, we demonstrate that the potassium permanganate-based oxidative chemical procedures used to synthesize graphite oxide or graphene nanoparticles leads to the confinement (intercalation) of trace amounts of Mn(2+) ions between the graphene sheets, and that these manganese intercalated graphitic and graphene structures show disparate structural, chemical and magnetic properties, and high relaxivity (up to 2 order) and distinctly different nuclear magnetic resonance dispersion profiles compared to paramagnetic chelate compounds. The results taken together with other published reports on confinement of paramagnetic metal ions within single-walled carbon nanotubes (a rolled up graphene sheet) show that confinement (encapsulation or intercalation) of paramagnetic metal ions within graphene sheets, and not the size, shape or architecture of the graphitic carbon particles is the key determinant for increasing relaxivity, and thus, identifies nano confinement of paramagnetic ions as novel general strategy to develop paramagnetic metal-ion graphitic-carbon complexes as high relaxivity MRI contrast agents."
https://openalex.org/W2042079426,"To assess the role of historical process and contemporary factors in shaping population structures in Northwestern Pacific, mitochondrial control region sequences were analyzed to characterize the phylogeography and population structure of the Japanese sand lance Ammodytes personatus. A total of 429 individuals sampled from 17 populations through the species' range are sequenced. Two distinct lineages are detected, which might have been divergent in the Sea of Japan and Pacific costal waters of Japanese Island, during the low sea level. Significant genetic structure is revealed between the Kuroshio and Oyashio Currents. However, significant genetic structure is also detected in the Sea of Japan, contracting expected homogenization hypothesis in Tsushima Current. The haplotype frequency of lineages in both sides of Japanese Island and significant genetic structure between north and south groups revealed that the distribution of lineage B and north group were highly limited by the annual sea temperature. The lack of lineage B in Qingdao population with low sea temperature reflects the sea temperature barrier. Lack of genetic structure in the south group and north group populations indicated that ocean currents within groups facilitated the dispersal of A. personatus."

Netrin-1, a bifunctional guidance cue, binds to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and DSCAM mediating axon attraction, and UNC5 mediating axon repulsion. Here, we show that DSCAM interacts with UNC5C and this interaction is stimulated by netrin-1 in primary cortical neurons and postnatal cerebellar granule cells.

In DSCAM deficient mice, retinal ganglion cells have defects in neuronal spacing and dendritic arborization patterns exhibiting neuronal self-avoidance phenotypes (35Fuerst P.G. Bruce F. Tian M.

In contrast, studies in the chicken retina have shown that DSCAM plays a role in synapse formation by promoting the targeting of retinal ganglion cell dendrites and bipolar cell axons to the same layer (37Yamagata M.

These results suggest that DSCAM may function as a bifunctional guidance receptor involved in either attractive or repulsive signaling pathways. We report here that DSCAM functions as a repulsive receptor associating with UNC5C to mediate netrin-1-induced axon growth cone collapse, and FAK, Fyn, and PAK1 are involved in coordinating netrin-1/DSCAM and netrin-1/UNC5C repulsive signaling. These studies not only reveal the role of DSCAM in netrin-mediated repulsion, but help us better understand the complexity of netrin signaling in the developing nervous system.

Neurons were grown on PLL-coated glass coverslips for growth cone collapse or immunostaining assays. For immunocytochemistry of DSCAM and UNC5C in dissociated primary neurons, cells on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in 4% pre-warmed paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (127 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.1 mm NaH2PO4, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Pipes) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After being washed three times with PBS, neurons were blocked in 10% normal goat serum for 1 h and incubated with the primary antibody solution for 2 h at 37 °C (rabbit anti-DSCAM, goat anti-UNC5C). Cells were washed in PBS three times followed by incubating with the secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit-488 and anti-goat-633) at 37 °C for 1 h. Neurons on coverslips were counterstained with DAPI and mounted onto slides using Fluorogel (EMS, PA). Images were taken under a confocal microscope (Olympus IX71 Fluoview). For studying the expression pattern of DSCAM and UNC5C in the developing nervous system, mouse embryos, and postnatal pups were collected. P2-P4 pups were perfused with 4% PFA intracardially and brain tissues transferred into cold 4% PFA overnight for further fixation. E15 mouse embryos were directly placed in cold 4% PFA overnight. Tissues were washed in PBS, transferred into sucrose-infiltration solution at 4 °C until the brain sank into the sucrose solution, and embedded in OCT. 14 μm coronal slices were cryosectioned and fixed with cold acetone on superfrost plus slides. After post-fixation with 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min, brain slices were subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval using citric acid (pH 6) and blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h in 1× PBST (1× PBS with 0.1% Tween-20), and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight (rabbit anti-DSCAM and goat anti-UNC5C). After washing three times in permeabilization buffer, slices were incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit-488 and anti-goat-633) for 2 h at 37 °C. Images were taken under a confocal microscope (Olympus IX71 Fluoview). The P2-4 mouse cerebellum was dissected and sliced into 200 μm sections using a tissue chopper (Vibratome, Bannockburn, IL). Only the external granule layer (EGL) was finely dissected using a sharpened tungsten needle and trypsinized at 37 °C for 15 min (42Alcántara S. Ruiz M. De Castro F. Soriano E. Sotelo C. Netrin 1 acts as an attractive or as a repulsive cue for distinct migrating neurons during the development of the cerebellar system.Development. 2000; 127: 1359-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After dissociation, neurons (1 × 104) were nucleofected (Amaxa, Walkersville, MD) with Venus yellow fluorescent protein (Venus-YFP) only or Venus-YFP plus DSCAM shRNAs, UNC5C shRNAs or different truncation mutants of DSCAM and UNC5C (DSCAM wild type, DSCAMΔC, DSCAMΔN, UNC5C wild type, UNC5CΔC, and UNC5CΔN) using program G-013. After electroporation, cells were plated onto PLL-coated coverslips and cultured in warm media (DMEM + B27 + 20 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 4 h, the media was replaced with fresh media to remove toxic nucleofection solution and neurons were cultured for 14 h. Neurons were starved in DMEM + 0.1% BSA + B27 for 4 h and stimulated with HEK293 control or netrin-1 conditioned media for 30 min. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min and stained with phalloidin and DAPI. Images of only YFP-labeled cells were taken using an epifluorescent microscope. For quantification, a single EGL cell with a clearly polarized axon was considered collapsed if it had no lamellipodia and two or fewer filopodia (43Bartoe J.L. McKenna W.L. Quan T.K. Stafford B.K.

UNC5 binds to DCC to switch DCC-mediated attraction into repulsion, raising the possibility that DSCAM may interact with UNC5 as well. To determine a potential interaction between DSCAM and UNC5, Flag-tagged full-length human DSCAM (DSCAM-Flag) and the full-length human UNC5C tagged with HA (UNC5C-HA) were expressed in HEK293 cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag for DSCAM and immunoblots probed with either anti-HA for UNC5C or anti-Flag for DSCAM (Fig. 1A). UNC5C-HA coimmunoprecipitated with DSCAM (Fig. 1A). The reciprocal IP confirmed the interaction of DSCAM and UNC5C in HEK293 cells (data not shown). To examine whether endogenous DSCAM interacts with UNC5C, primary cortical neurons were used because these neurons express both DSCAM and UNC5C and cortex dissection, dissociation, and culturing is fairly straightforward (21Liu G.

After 24 h of primary culture, dissociated neurons were serum-starved in DMEM containing B27 for 4 h and stimulated with either purified netrin-1 (250 ng/ml) or sham-purified control. DSCAM was immunoprecipitated with anti-DSCAM and blotted for UNC5C and DSCAM (Fig. 1B). We found that UNC5C was co-immunoprecipitated with DSCAM and netrin-1 stimulation increased the DSCAM/UNC5C interaction (Fig. 1B). Netrin-1 enhanced the interaction of DSCAM and UNC5C within 5 min and the enhancement was sustained up to 20 min (Fig. 1B). To study whether DSCAM interacts with UNC5C in the postnatal mouse cerebellum, P2 mouse cerebellar neurons were dissociated and stimulated with or without netrin-1, as described previously (21Liu G.

Netrin-1 dramatically induced DSCAM/UNC5C interaction and continued to increase this interaction over 20 min (Fig. 1C). Netrin-1-induced interaction of endogenous DSCAM and UNC5C in E15 cortical and P2 cerebellar neurons was also observed in the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown).

Utility-scale renewable energy development (>1 MW capacity) is a key strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but development of those facilities also can have adverse effects on biodiversity. Here, we examine the synergy between renewable energy generation goals and those for biodiversity conservation in the 13 M ha Mojave Desert of the southwestern USA. We integrated spatial data on biodiversity conservation value, solar energy potential, and land surface slope angle (a key determinant of development feasibility) and found there to be sufficient area to meet renewable energy goals without developing on lands of relatively high conservation value. Indeed, we found nearly 200,000 ha of lower conservation value land below the most restrictive slope angle (<1%); that area could meet the state of California’s current 33% renewable energy goal 1.8 times over. We found over 740,000 ha below the highest slope angle (<5%) – an area that can meet California’s renewable energy goal seven times over. Our analysis also suggests that the supply of high quality habitat on private land may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future solar projects, so enhancing public land management may need to be considered among the options to offset such impacts. Using the approach presented here, planners could reduce development impacts on areas of higher conservation value, and so reduce trade-offs between converting to a green energy economy and conserving biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W1968869086,"Background Among herbivorous insects that have exploited agro-ecosystems, the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae, is recognized as one of the most important agricultural pests worldwide. Uses over 400 plant species and has evolved different insecticides resistance mechanisms. As M. persicae feeds upon a huge diversity of hosts, it has been exposed to a wide variety of plant allelochemicals, which probably have promoted a wide range of detoxification systems. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work we (i) evaluated whether insecticide resistance mutations (IRM) in M. persicae can give an advantage in terms of reproductive fitness when aphids face two hosts, pepper (Capsicum annuum) a suitable host and radish (Raphanus sativus) the unfavorable host and (ii) examined the transcriptional expression of six genes that are known to be up-regulated in response to insecticides. Our results show a significant interaction between host and IRM on the intrinsic rate of increase (rm). Susceptible genotypes (not carrying insensitivity mutations) had a higher rm on pepper, and the transcriptional levels of five genes increased on radish. The rm relationship was reversed on the unfavorable host; genotypes with multiple IRM exhibited higher rm, without altering the transcriptional levels of the studied genes. Genotypes with one IRM kept a similar rm on both hosts, but they increased the transcriptional levels of two genes. Conclusions/Significance Although we have studied only nine genotypes, overall our results are in agreement with the general idea that allelochemical detoxification systems could constitute a pre-adaptation for the development of insecticide resistance. Genotypes carrying IRM exhibited a higher rm than susceptible genotypes on radish, the more unfavorable host. Susceptible genotypes should be able to tolerate the defended host by up-regulating some metabolic genes that are also responding to insecticides. Hence, our results suggest that the trade-off among resistance mechanisms might be quite complex, with a multiplicity of costs and benefits depending on the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2171364287,"Background Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), is sorted to be enzymatic chaperone for reconstructing misfolded protein in endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Recently, PDI has been identified as a link between misfolded protein and neuron apoptosis. However, the potential for PDI to be involved in the pathogenesis of prion disease remains unknown. In this study, we propose that PDI may function as a pleiotropic regulator in the cytotoxicity induced by mutated prion proteins and in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate potential alterations of PDI in prion diseases, the levels of PDI and relevant apoptotic executors in 263K infected hamsters brain tissues were evaluated with the use of Western blots. Abnormal upregulation of PDI, Grp78 and Grp58 was detected. Dynamic assays of PDI alteration identified that the upregulation of PDI started at the early stage and persistently increased till later stage. Obvious increases of PDI and Grp78 levels were also observed in cultured cells transiently expressing PrP mutants, PrP-KDEL or PrP-PG15, accompanied by significant cytotoxicities. Excessive expression of PDI partially eased ER stress and cell apoptosis caused by accumulation of PrP-KDEL, but had less effect on cytotoxicity induced by PrP-PG15. Knockdown of endogenous PDI significantly amended cytotoxicity of PrP-PG15, but had little influence on that of PrP-KDEL. A series of membrane potential assays found that apoptosis induced by misfolded PrP proteins could be regulated by PDI via mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, biotin-switch assays demonstrated active S-nitrosylted modifications of PDI (SNO-PDI) both in the brains of scrapie-infected rodents and in the cells with misfolded PrP proteins. Conclusion/Significance Current data in this study highlight that PDI and its relevant executors may function as a pleiotropic regulator in the processes of different misfolded PrP proteins and at different stages during prion infection. SNO-PDI may feed as an accomplice for PDI apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1974619428,"Streptococcus sanguinis is the most common cause of infective endocarditis (IE). Since the molecular basis of virulence of this oral commensal bacterium remains unclear, we searched the genome of S. sanguinis for previously unidentified virulence factors. We identified a cell surface ecto-5′-nucleotidase (Nt5e), as a candidate virulence factor. By colorimetric phosphate assay, we showed that S. sanguinis Nt5e can hydrolyze extracellular adenosine triphosphate to generate adenosine. Moreover, a nt5e deletion mutant showed significantly shorter lag time (P<0.05) to onset of platelet aggregation than the wild-type strain, without affecting platelet-bacterial adhesion in vitro (P = 0.98). In the absence of nt5e, S. sanguinis caused IE (4 d) in a rabbit model with significantly decreased mass of vegetations (P<0.01) and recovered bacterial loads (log10CFU, P = 0.01), suggesting that Nt5e contributes to the virulence of S. sanguinis in vivo. As a virulence factor, Nt5e may function by (i) hydrolyzing ATP, a pro-inflammatory molecule, and generating adenosine, an immunosuppressive molecule to inhibit phagocytic monocytes/macrophages associated with valvular vegetations. (ii) Nt5e-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation could also delay presentation of platelet microbicidal proteins to infecting bacteria on heart valves. Both plausible Nt5e-dependent mechanisms would promote survival of infecting S. sanguinis. In conclusion, we now show for the first time that streptococcal Nt5e modulates S. sanguinis-induced platelet aggregation and may contribute to the virulence of streptococci in experimental IE."
https://openalex.org/W2088563235,"When grown in continuous culture, budding yeast cells tend to synchronize their respiratory activity to form a stable oscillation that percolates throughout cellular physiology and involves the majority of the protein-coding transcriptome. Oscillations in batch culture and at single cell level support the idea that these dynamics constitute a general growth principle. The precise molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the oscillation remain elusive. Fourier analysis of transcriptome time series datasets from two different oscillation periods (0.7 h and 5 h) reveals seven distinct co-expression clusters common to both systems (34% of all yeast ORF), which consolidate into two superclusters when correlated with a compilation of 1,327 unrelated transcriptome datasets. These superclusters encode for cell growth and anabolism during the phase of high, and mitochondrial growth, catabolism and stress response during the phase of low oxygen uptake. The promoters of each cluster are characterized by different nucleotide contents, promoter nucleosome configurations, and dependence on ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes. We show that the ATP:ADP ratio oscillates, compatible with alternating metabolic activity of the two superclusters and differential feedback on their transcription via activating (RSC) and repressive (Isw2) types of promoter structure remodeling. We propose a novel feedback mechanism, where the energetic state of the cell, reflected in the ATP:ADP ratio, gates the transcription of large, but functionally coherent groups of genes via differential effects of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling machineries. Besides providing a mechanistic hypothesis for the delayed negative feedback that results in the oscillatory phenotype, this mechanism may underpin the continuous adaptation of growth to environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2011997791,"The green anole (Anolis carolinensis) has been widely used as an animal model in physiology and neurobiology but has recently emerged as an important genomic model. The recent sequencing of its genome has shed new light on the evolution of vertebrate genomes and on the process that govern species diversification. Surprisingly, the patterns of genetic diversity within natural populations of this widespread and abundant North American lizard remain relatively unknown. In the present study, we use 10 novel nuclear DNA sequence loci (N = 62 to 152) and one mitochondrial locus (N = 226) to delimit green anole populations and infer their historical demography. We uncovered four evolutionarily distinct and geographically restricted lineages of green anoles using phylogenetics, Bayesian clustering, and genetic distance methods. Molecular dating indicates that these lineages last shared a common ancestor ∼2 million years ago. Summary statistics and analysis of the frequency distributions of DNA polymorphisms strongly suggest range-wide expansions in population size. Using Bayesian Skyline Plots, we inferred the timing of population size expansions, which differ across lineages, and found evidence for a relatively recent and rapid westward expansion of green anoles across the Gulf Coastal Plain during the mid-Pleistocene. One surprising result is that the distribution of genetic diversity is not consistent with a latitudinal shift caused by climatic oscillations as is observed for many co-distributed taxa. This suggests that the most recent Pleistocene glacial cycles had a limited impact on the geographic distribution of the green anole at the northern limits of its range."
https://openalex.org/W2089768194,"The attentional set-shifting deficit that has been observed in Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been considered neuropsychological evidence of the involvement of meso-prefrontal and prefrontal-striatal circuits in cognitive flexibility. However, recent studies have suggested that non-dopaminergic, posterior cortical pathologies may also contribute to this deficit. Although several neuroimaging studies have addressed this issue, the results of these studies were confounded by the use of tasks that required other cognitive processes in addition to set-shifting, such as rule learning and working memory. In this study, we attempted to identify the neural correlates of the attentional set-shifting deficit in PD using a compound letter task and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography during rest. Shift cost, which is a measure of attentional set-shifting ability, was significantly correlated with hypometabolism in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including the putative human frontal eye field. Our results provide direct evidence that dysfunction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex makes a primary contribution to the attentional set-shifting deficit that has been observed in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2047664825,"The 3' splice site of influenza A segment 7 is used to produce mRNA for the M2 ion-channel protein, which is critical to the formation of viable influenza virions. Native gel analysis, enzymatic/chemical structure probing, and oligonucleotide binding studies of a 63 nt fragment, containing the 3' splice site, key residues of an SF2/ASF splicing factor binding site, and a polypyrimidine tract, provide evidence for an equilibrium between pseudoknot and hairpin structures. This equilibrium is sensitive to multivalent cations, and can be forced towards the pseudoknot by addition of 5 mM cobalt hexammine. In the two conformations, the splice site and other functional elements exist in very different structural environments. In particular, the splice site is sequestered in the middle of a double helix in the pseudoknot conformation, while in the hairpin it resides in a two-by-two nucleotide internal loop. The results suggest that segment 7 mRNA splicing can be controlled by a conformational switch that exposes or hides the splice site."

However, they differ in hosts, vectors and pathogenicity: T. cruzi is a human pathogen infective to virtually all mammals whilst the other two species are non-pathogenic and bat restricted. Previous studies suggest that variations in expression levels and genetic diversity of cruzipain, the major isoform of cathepsin L-like (CATL) enzymes of T. cruzi, correlate with levels of cellular invasion, differentiation, virulence and pathogenicity of distinct strains. In this study, we compared 80 sequences of genes encoding cruzipain from 25 T. cruzi isolates representative of all discrete typing units (DTUs TcI-TcVI) and the new genotype Tcbat and 10 sequences of homologous genes from other species. The catalytic domain repertoires diverged according to DTUs and trypanosome species. Relatively homogeneous sequences are found within and among isolates of the same DTU except TcV and TcVI, which displayed sequences unique or identical to those of TcII and TcIII, supporting their origin from the hybridization between these two DTUs. In network genealogies, sequences from T. cruzi clustered tightly together and closer to T. c. marinkellei than to T. dionisii and largely differed from homologues of T. rangeli and T. b. brucei. Here, analysis of isolates representative of the overall biological and genetic diversity of T. cruzi and closest T. cruzi-like species evidenced DTU- and species-specific polymorphisms corroborating phylogenetic relationships inferred with other genes. Comparison of both phylogenetically close and distant trypanosomes is valuable to understand host-parasite interactions, virulence and pathogenicity. Our findings corroborate cruzipain as valuable target for drugs, vaccine, diagnostic and genotyping approaches."

The current studies assessed whether genetic essentialist biases would also be evident at the automatic level. In two studies, using different versions of the Implicit Association Test [1], we found that participants were faster to categorize when genes and fate were linked, compared to when these two concepts were kept separate and opposing. In addition to the wealth of past findings of genetic essentialism with explicit and deliberative measures, these biases appear to be also evident with implicit measures"
https://openalex.org/W2056360403,"MyD88, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein, mediates signals from the Toll-like receptors (TLR) or IL-1/IL-18 receptors to downstream kinases. In MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling, the function of MyD88 is enhanced by another TIR domain-containing adaptor, Mal/TIRAP, which brings MyD88 to the plasma membrane and promotes its interaction with the cytosolic region of TLR4. Hence, Mal is recognized as the ""sorting adaptor"" for MyD88. In this study, a direct interaction between MyD88-TIR and another membrane-sorting adaptor, TRAM/TICAM-2, was demonstrated in vitro. Cell-based assays including RNA interference experiments and TRAM deficient mice revealed that the interplay between MyD88 and TRAM in cells is important in mediating IL-18 signal transduction. Live cell imaging further demonstrated the co-localized accumulation of MyD88 and TRAM in the membrane regions in HEK293 cells. These findings suggest that TRAM serves as the sorting adaptor for MyD88 in IL-18 signaling, which then facilitates the signal transduction. The binding sites for TRAM are located in the TIR domain of MyD88 and actually overlap with the binding sites for Mal. MyD88, the multifunctional signaling adaptor that works together with most of the TLR members and with the IL-1/IL-18 receptors, can interact with two distinct sorting adaptors, TRAM and Mal, in a conserved manner in a distinct context."

Although the contribution of sequence diversity to this molecular recognition has been studied for decades, recent models suggest that protein dynamics may also broaden the range of targets recognized. To characterize the contribution of protein dynamics to immunological molecular recognition, we report the sequence, thermodynamic, and time-resolved spectroscopic characterization of a panel of eight Abs elicited to the chromophoric antigen 8-methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (MPTS). Based on the sequence data, three of the Abs arose from unique germ line Abs, whereas the remaining five comprise two sets of siblings that arose by somatic mutation of a common precursor. The thermodynamic data indicate that the Abs recognize MPTS via a variety of mechanisms. Although the spectroscopic data reveal small differences in protein dynamics, the anti-MPTS Abs generally show similar levels of flexibility and conformational heterogeneity, possibly representing the convergent evolution of the dynamics necessary for function. However, one Ab is significantly more rigid and conformationally homogeneous than the others, including a sibling Ab from which it differs by only five somatic mutations. This example of divergent evolution demonstrates that point mutations are capable of fixing significant differences in protein dynamics. The results provide unique insight into how high affinity Abs may be produced that bind virtually any target and possibly, from a more general perspective, how new protein functions are evolved.

Molecular recognition underlies virtually all of the functions that a protein may possess, and the limiting models of molecular recognition, lock-and-key and induced fit or conformational selection, are differentiated by the underlying protein dynamics. Protein dynamics may also be critical for the evolution of new protein functions by bestowing progenitor proteins with flexibility and conformational heterogeneity, where different conformations have unique physicochemical properties (8Jimenez R.

Nowhere is the importance of molecular recognition and its evolution more evident than during an immune response, where antibodies (Abs) 3The abbreviations used are: AbantibodyMPTS8-methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonateCDRcomplementarity-determining regionVLlight-chain variable regionVHheavy-chain variable region3PEPSthree-pulse photon echo peak shiftTGtransient grating. specific for virtually any target may be produced within days of their first encounter. The contribution of sequence diversity to the Ab repertoire and its specificities has been studied intensively for years (23Tonegawa S.

A modification of Jerne's theory of antibody production using the concept of clonal selection.Aust. J. Sci. 1957; 20: 67-69Google Scholar), its “one receptor-one target” foundation is suggestive of the lock-and-key mechanism of molecular recognition and is thus consistent with a high level of rigidity. This notion is in contrast with the older instructive hypothesis (27Breinl F. Haurowitz F.

Unfortunately, characterizing the dynamics of any protein is experimentally challenging, and thus the range of dynamics possible within Abs, and how it might contribute to Ab evolution, has remained difficult to test. antibody 8-methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate complementarity-determining region light-chain variable region heavy-chain variable region three-pulse photon echo peak shift transient grating. The ability to rigorously characterize the dynamics of a chromophore's environment has been revolutionized by ultrafast nonlinear optical methods, such as three-pulse photon echo peak shift (3PEPS) spectroscopy (37Cho M. Yu J.Y. Joo T. Nagasawa Y. Passino S.A. Fleming G.R. The integrated photon echo and solvation dynamics.J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 11944-11953Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 38de Boeij W.P.

Chem. 1996; 47: 109-134Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar). 3PEPS spectroscopy relies on the application of a series of three short laser pulses. The first two pulses inscribe a phase grating in the sample. After a variable time delay, referred to as the population time, a third pulse triggers rephasing of the sample, but only chromophores that have an unaltered phase can contribute to rephasing and thus emit an echo signal. Fluctuations of the environment randomize the phase of the chromophore, which, with increasing population time, results in fewer chromophores contributing to rephasing and an apparent peak shift of the echo signal, commonly described by M(t), the energy gap autocorrelation function. M(t) is conveniently represented in the frequency domain with the corresponding spectral density, ρ(ω) (40Mukamel S. Principles of Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar), which represents the frequency and amplitude of the environment's motions. Additionally, dynamics that appear static on the time scale of the 3PEPS experiment are manifest as a non-zero asymptote of the peak shift, thus making it possible to detect and quantify static heterogeneity (39Fleming G.R. Cho M.H. Chromophore-solvent dynamics.Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1996; 47: 109-134Crossref Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 40Mukamel S. Principles of Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy.

To achieve this, we immunized mice with different chromophore-protein conjugates and isolated Abs that evolved to bind the chromophore. Although Abs generally evolve to bind protein targets, small molecule targets (or antigens (Ags)) have played a central role in the study of Ab structure and function, and the chromophoric Ags are expected to bind as would any other. The Ab-Ag complexes were characterized using 3PEPS and transient grating (TG) spectroscopy, and motions on several distinct sets of time scales were observed. For one anti-fluorescein (Fl) Ab, we also characterized protein dynamics as a function of somatic evolution (affinity maturation) (10Jimenez R. Salazar G. Yin J. Joo T. Romesberg F.E. Protein dynamics and the immunological evolution of molecular recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3803-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Zimmermann J. Oakman E.L.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13722-13727Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We found that evolution significantly restricted the observed dynamics, consistent with the evolution of flexible germ line Abs that are polyspecific and recognize their Ags via an induced fit- or conformational selection-like mechanism, into more rigid Abs that more specifically recognize their Ags via a lock-and-key-like mechanism. To further explore the range of dynamics inherent to an immune response and how the dynamics might be tailored by somatic evolution, we now report the detailed analysis of eight Abs that evolved in mice to bind the chromophore 8-methoxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (MPTS; Fig. 1). Sequence, thermodynamic, and dynamic characterization via 3PEPS and TG spectroscopy reveal the range in affinities and dynamics possessed by the antibodies that constitute the immune response to MPTS and also provide interesting examples of parallel, convergent, and divergent evolution. Production of the panel of monoclonal antibodies was performed as described previously using an MPTS-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate (8Jimenez R. Case D.A. Romesberg F.E. Flexibility of an antibody binding site measured with photon echo spectroscopy.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 1090-1103Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Heavy-chain variable region (VH) and light-chain variable region (VL) gene sequences were also determined as described previously (41Thielges M.C. Zimmermann J. Yu W. Oda M. Romesberg F.E. Exploring the energy landscape of antibody-antigen complexes. Protein dynamics, flexibility, and molecular recognition.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7237-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (Ambion) from mRNA isolated from fresh hybridoma cells. A primer set specifically designed for mouse variable immunoglobulin regions (42Sastry L. Alting-Mees M. Huse W.D. Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Hay B.N. Janda K.D. Benkovic S.J. Lerner R.A.

The resulting gene fragments were sequenced using standard procedures. Nucleotide sequences of the VH and VL genes are provided in supplemental Data Set S1. Isothermal titration calorimetric experiments were performed using an MCS-ITC or a VP-ITC calorimeter (GE Healthcare) and analyzed with Origin 6.0 (Microcal) software. Titrations were performed between 20 and 35 °C. In each titration, 19 consecutive injections of MPTS every 240 s followed a single, preliminary injection into an 8 μm solution of Ab (IgG) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), to a final concentration of 150 μm MPTS. A titration of MPTS into buffer alone was used to correct for the heat of dilution of the titrant. The resulting ΔH0 and ΔG0 values were used to calculate TΔS0 = ΔH0 − ΔG0 at each temperature and ΔCp0 from a linear fit to ΔH0(T). The total entropy was approximated as follows, ΔS0=ΔSconf0-8 cal K-1mol-1+ΔCp0In(T/385 K)(Eq. 1) where ΔSconf0 is the entropy change from changes of internal motions of protein and ligand (41Thielges M.C. Zimmermann J. Yu W. Oda M. Romesberg F.E. Exploring the energy landscape of antibody-antigen complexes. Protein dynamics, flexibility, and molecular recognition.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7237-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Samples containing 700 μm Ab (IgG) and 700 μm MPTS in PBS were washed extensively with PBS by repeated dilution and microfiltration (10,000 molecular weight cut-off, Amicon Ultra, Millipore) to remove unbound MPTS, until the filtrate was free of MPTS as measured by UV-visible absorption. The experimental setup for 3PEPS and TG has been described previously (8Jimenez R. Case D.A. Romesberg F.E. Flexibility of an antibody binding site measured with photon echo spectroscopy.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 1090-1103Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, the damped output of a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system (Spectra Physics Spitfire, 5 kHz, 200-mJ pulses at 825 nm) was doubled in a 0.2-mm-thick type I BBO crystal and sent through a prism compressor, producing 416-nm pulses with ∼45-fs duration, as determined by two-photon absorption in DMSO. Typical pulse energies at the sample were ∼20 nJ/pulse. Beam splitters were then used to generate three beams of approximately equal intensity, two of which were then variably delayed using a pair of delay stages (PM6000, Kensington Laboratories). After passing through the delay stages, the three beams were arranged in an equilateral triangle of ∼7 mm/side and focused with a 200-mm focal length plano-convex fused silica lens into a home-built spinning cell with a path length of 200 μm containing sample. The entire setup was maintained at 22 ± 1 °C. Proper masks were used to block the excitation light and allow only signal in the two phase-matching directions k1−k2+k3 and −k1+k2+k3 to pass to two silica photodiodes (DET110, Thorlabs) connected to lock-in amplifiers (SR830, Stanford). The lock-in amplifiers were referenced to a chopper (3501 Optical Chopper, New Focus, Inc.) phase-locked to the Q-switch RF frequency of the amplifier system, which was placed in the path of the fixed-delay beam. For the 3PEPS experiments, the coherence period, τ, the delay between the first and second pulses, was scanned from −150 to 150 fs for a fixed value of the population period, T, the delay between the second and third pulses. The peak shift for a given population period was then calculated from the average shift from zero of the temporal signal maximum in τ for the two phase-matching directions. As many as 40 scans at a given population time were averaged for a total of 40–50 exponentially spaced population times. To detect day-to-day instrument drift, the terminal peak shift (100 ps population time) of MPTS in a solution containing an anti-Fl antibody (700 μm) was measured on each day that experiments were performed to ensure reproducibility. At least three independent trials were performed for each 3PEPS and TG experiment. Sample degradation was eliminated as a concern by monitoring the UV-visible spectrum of the samples before and after a 3PEPS or TG experiment. TG data were fit to double exponential decays with Origin 6.0 (Microcal). Parameters of the spectral densities were obtained from a simultaneous fit of the experimental 3PEPS data and the steady-state absorption spectra using Mukamel's response function formalism (40Mukamel S. Principles of Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar), as described in detail previously (41Thielges M.C. Zimmermann J. Yu W. Oda M. Romesberg F.E. Exploring the energy landscape of antibody-antigen complexes. Protein dynamics, flexibility, and molecular recognition.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7237-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, the total spectral density, ρ(ω), was calculated from the sum of the vibrations of the chromophore, ρMPTS(ω), and the vibrations of the protein, ρAb(ω). Intramolecular vibrational frequencies and excitation-induced displacements of MPTS were obtained from quantum chemical calculations and validated by experimentally determined Raman frequencies, as described previously (8Jimenez R.

Specifically, the underdamped Brownian oscillator term, ρBO(ω)=2λBOπωωBO2ΓBO(ωBO2+ω2)2+ΓBO2ω2(Eq. 2) was used to represent the inertial subpicosecond protein dynamics, where λBO is the reorganization energy, ωBO is the frequency, and ΓBO is the damping constant of the Brownian oscillator, and the Kubo terms, ρKI=λKIπωτKI1+ω2τKI2(Eq. 3) were used to represent the picosecond dynamics, where λK and τK are the reorganization energy and time constant, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2004073673,"Background Multiple loci and population genetic methods were employed to study the phylogeographic history of the Patagonian freshwater crab Aegla neuquensis (Aeglidae: Decopoda). This taxon occurs in two large river systems in the Patagonian Steppe, from the foothills of the Andes Mountains east to the Atlantic Ocean. Methodology/Principal Findings A nuclear phylogeny and multilocus nested clade phylogeographic analysis detected a fragmentation event between the Negro and Chico-Chubut river systems. This event occurred approximately 137 thousand years ago. An isolation-with-migration analysis and maximum-likelihood estimates of gene flow showed asymmetrical exchange of genetic material between these two river systems exclusively in their headwaters. We used information theory to determine the best-fit demographic history between these two river systems under an isolation-with-migration model. The best-fit model suggests that the Negro and the ancestral populations have the same effective population sizes; whereas the Chico-Chubut population is smaller and shows that gene flow from the Chico-Chubut into the Negro is four times higher than in the reverse direction. Much of the Chico-Chubut system appears to have only been recently colonized while the Negro populations appear to have been in place for most of the evolutionary history of this taxon. Conclusions/Significance Due to mitochondrial introgression, three nuclear loci provided different phylogeographic resolution than the three mitochondrial genes for an ancient fragmentation event observed in the nuclear phylogeny. However, the mitochondrial locus provided greater resolution on more recent evolutionary events. Our study, therefore, demonstrates the need to include both nuclear and mitochondrial loci for a more complete understanding of evolutionary histories and associated phylogeographic events. Our results suggest that gene flow between these systems, before and after fragmentation was through periodic paleolakes that formed in the headwaters region. Fragmentation between the Negro and Chico-Chubut systems was driven by the disappearance of these paleolakes during the Patagonian Glaciation."
https://openalex.org/W1979248546,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) modulates immune responses and cellular proliferation. The objective of this study was to assess whether inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin modifies disease severity in two experimental murine models of house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma. In an induction model, rapamycin was administered to BALB/c mice coincident with nasal HDM challenges for 3 weeks. In a treatment model, nasal HDM challenges were performed for 6 weeks and rapamycin treatment was administered during weeks 4 through 6. In the induction model, rapamycin significantly attenuated airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and goblet cell hyperplasia. In contrast, treatment of established HDM-induced asthma with rapamycin exacerbated AHR and airway inflammation, whereas goblet cell hyperplasia was not modified. Phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, which is downstream of mTORC1, was increased after 3 weeks, but not 6 weeks of HDM-challenge. Rapamycin reduced S6 phosphorylation in HDM-challenged mice in both the induction and treatment models. Thus, the paradoxical effects of rapamycin on asthma severity paralleled the activation of mTOR signaling. Lastly, mediastinal lymph node re-stimulation experiments showed that treatment of rapamycin-naive T cells with ex vivo rapamycin decreased antigen-specific Th2 cytokine production, whereas prior exposure to in vivo rapamycin rendered T cells refractory to the suppressive effects of ex vivo rapamycin. We conclude that rapamycin had paradoxical effects on the pathogenesis of experimental HDM-induced asthma. Thus, consistent with the context-dependent effects of rapamycin on inflammation, the timing of mTOR inhibition may be an important determinant of efficacy and toxicity in HDM-induced asthma."

The C-terminal tail of the IGF-1R exhibits regulatory function, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that mutation of Ser-1248 (S1248A) enhances IGF-1R in vitro kinase activity, autophosphorylation, Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin activity, and cell growth. Ser-1248 phosphorylation is mediated by GSK-3β in a mechanism that involves a priming phosphorylation on Ser-1252. GSK-3β knock-out cells exhibit reduced IGF-1R cell surface expression, enhanced IGF-1R kinase activity, and signaling. Examination of crystallographic structures of the IGF-1R kinase domain revealed that the 1248SFYYS1252 motif adopts a conformation tightly packed against the kinase C-lobe when Ser-1248 is in the unphosphorylated state that favors kinase activity. S1248A mutation is predicted to lock the motif in this position. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-1248 will drive profound structural transition of the sequence, critically affecting connection of the C terminus as well as exposing potential protein docking sites. Decreased kinase activity of a phosphomimetic S1248E mutant and enhanced kinase activity in mutants of its predicted target residue Lys-1081 support this auto-inhibitory model.

https://openalex.org/W2085536315,"Pigs can act as intermediate hosts by which reassorted influenza A virus (IAV) strains can be transmitted to humans and cause pandemic influenza outbreaks. The innate host defense component surfactant protein D (SP-D) interacts with glycans on the hemagglutinin of IAV and contributes to protection against IAV infection in mammals. This study shows that a recombinant trimeric neck lectin fragment derived from porcine SP-D (pSP-D) exhibits profound inhibitory activity against IAV, in contrast to comparable fragments derived from human SP-D. Crystallographic analysis of the pSP-D fragment complexed with a viral sugar component shows that a unique tripeptide loop alters the lectin site conformation of pSP-D. Molecular dynamics simulations highlight the role of this flexible loop, which adopts a more stable conformation upon sugar binding and may facilitate binding to viral glycans through contact with distal portions of the branched mannoside. The combined data demonstrate that porcine-specific structural features of SP-D contribute significantly to its distinct anti-IAV activity. These findings could help explain why pigs serve as important reservoirs for newly emerging pathogenic IAV strains."
https://openalex.org/W2043923612,"This study investigated the behavioural and brain responses towards conditioned flavours with different hedonic values in juvenile pigs. Twelve 30-kg pigs were given four three-day conditioning sessions: they received three different flavoured meals paired with intraduodenal (i.d.) infusions of 15% glucose (F(Glu)), lithium chloride (F(LiCl)), or saline (control treatment, F(NaCl)). One and five weeks later, the animals were subjected to three two-choice feeding tests without reinforcement to check the acquisition of a conditioned flavour preference or aversion. In between, the anaesthetised pigs were subjected to three (18)FDG PET brain imaging coupled with an olfactogustatory stimulation with the conditioned flavours. During conditioning, the pigs spent more time lying inactive, and investigated their environment less after the F(LiCl) than the F(NaCl) or F(Glu) meals. During the two-choice tests performed one and five weeks later, the F(NaCl) and F(Glu) foods were significantly preferred over the F(LICl) food even in the absence of i.d. infusions. Surprisingly, the F(NaCl) food was also preferred over the F(Glu) food during the first test only, suggesting that, while LiCl i.d. infusions led to a strong flavour aversion, glucose infusions failed to induce flavour preference. As for brain imaging results, exposure to aversive or less preferred flavours triggered global deactivation of the prefrontal cortex, specific activation of the posterior cingulate cortex, as well as asymmetric brain responses in the basal nuclei and the temporal gyrus. In conclusion, postingestive visceral stimuli can modulate the flavour/food hedonism and further feeding choices. Exposure to flavours with different hedonic values induced metabolism differences in neural circuits known to be involved in humans in the characterization of food palatability, feeding motivation, reward expectation, and more generally in the regulation of food intake."
https://openalex.org/W2069008021,"Primary cicatricial alopecia (PCA) is a group of inflammatory hair disorders that cause scarring and permanent hair loss. Previous studies have implicated PPARγ, a transcription factor that integrates lipogenic and inflammatory signals, in the pathogenesis of PCA. However, it is unknown what triggers the inflammatory response in these disorders, whether the inflammation is a primary or secondary event in disease pathogenesis, and whether the inflammatory reaction reflects an autoimmune process. In this paper, we show that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is impaired in the skin and hair follicles of PCA patients. Treatment of hair follicle cells with BM15766, a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, or 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), a sterol precursor, stimulates the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokine genes. Painting of mouse skin with 7-DHC or BM15766 inhibits hair growth, causes follicular plugging and induces the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the interfollicular dermis. Our results demonstrate that cholesterologenic changes within hair follicle cells trigger an innate immune response that is associated with the induction of toll-like receptor (TLR) and interferon (IFN) gene expression, and the recruitment of macrophages that surround the hair follicles and initiate their destruction. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected role for cholesterol precursors in PCA pathogenesis and identify a novel link between sterols and inflammation that may prove transformative in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2069172088,"Amphibians worldwide are experiencing devastating declines, some of which are due to the amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, Bd). Populations in the southeastern United States, however, have not been noticeably affected by the pathogen. The green treefrog (Hyla cinerea) is abundant and widespread in the southeastern United States, but has not been documented to harbor Bd infection. This study examined the susceptibility of H. cinerea to two strains of Bd in the lab and the prevalence of infection in wild populations of this species in southeastern Louisiana. Although we were able to infect H. cinerea with Bd in the lab, we did not observe any clinical signs of chytridiomycosis. Furthermore, infection by Bd does not appear to negatively affect body condition or growth rate of post-metamorphic individuals. We found no evidence of infection in surveys of wild H. cinerea. Our results suggest that H. cinerea is not susceptible to chytridiomycosis post-metamorphosis and probably is not an important carrier of the fungal pathogen Bd in the southeastern United States, although susceptibility at the larval stage remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2093857954,"Background Induction of Type I Interferon (IFN) genes constitutes an essential step leading to innate immune responses during virus infection. Sendai virus (SeV) infection of B lymphoid Namalwa cells transiently induces the transcriptional expression of multiple IFN-A genes. Although transcriptional activation of IFN-A genes has been extensively studied, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation of their expression remains to be determined. Principal Findings In this study, we demonstrate that virus infection of Namalwa cells induces transient recruitment of HDAC3 (histone deacetylase 3) to IFN-A promoters. Analysis of chromatin-protein association by Chip-QPCR demonstrated that recruitment of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 and IRF7, as well as TBP correlated with enhanced histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, whereas recruitment of HDAC3 correlated with inhibition of histone H3K9/K14 acetylation, removal of IRF7 and TATA-binding protein (TBP) from IFN-A promoters and inhibition of virus-induced IFN-A gene transcription. Additionally, HDAC3 overexpression reduced, and HDAC3 depletion by siRNA enhanced IFN-A gene expression. Furthermore, activation of IRF7 enhanced histone H3K9/K14 acetylation and IFN-A gene expression, whereas activation of both IRF7 and IRF3 led to recruitment of HDAC3 to the IFN-A gene promoters, resulting in impaired histone H3K9 acetylation and attenuation of IFN-A gene transcription. Conclusion Altogether these data indicate that reversal of histone H3K9/K14 acetylation by HDAC3 is required for attenuation of IFN-A gene transcription during viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W1993958252,"Coevolution analyses identify residues that co-vary with each other during evolution, revealing sequence relationships unobservable from traditional multiple sequence alignments. Here we describe a coevolutionary analysis of phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM/PGM), a widespread and diverse enzyme family involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis. Mutual information and graph theory were utilized to identify a network of highly connected residues with high significance. An examination of the most tightly connected regions of the coevolutionary network reveals that most of the involved residues are localized near an interdomain interface of this enzyme, known to be the site of a functionally important conformational change. The roles of four interface residues found in this network were examined via site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic characterization. For three of these residues, mutation to alanine reduces enzyme specificity to ∼10% or less of wild-type, while the other has ∼45% activity of wild-type enzyme. An additional mutant of an interface residue that is not densely connected in the coevolutionary network was also characterized, and shows no change in activity relative to wild-type enzyme. The results of these studies are interpreted in the context of structural and functional data on PMM/PGM. Together, they demonstrate that a network of coevolving residues links the highly conserved active site with the interdomain conformational change necessary for the multi-step catalytic reaction. This work adds to our understanding of the functional roles of coevolving residue networks, and has implications for the definition of catalytically important residues."

B10RIII mice were subretinally injected with AAV2.IFN-α alone (1.5×107 vg), AAV2.IL-4 alone (3.55×107 vg), and AAV2.IFN-α combined with AAV2.IL-4.

IFN-α and IL-4 were effectively expressed in the eyes from three weeks to three months following subretinal injection of AAV2 vectors either alone or following combined administration and significantly attenuated EAU activity clinically and histopathologically. AAV2.IL-4 showed a better therapeutic effect as compared to AAV2.IFN-α. The combination of AAV2.IL-4 and AAV2.IFN-α was not significantly different as compared to AAV2.IL-4 alone. There was no difference concerning DTH (delayed-type hypersensitivity) reaction, lymphocyte proliferation and IL-17 production among the investigated treatment groups, suggesting that local retinal gene delivery did not affect the systemic immune response."

https://openalex.org/W1984791337,"The ability to regenerate tissues is shared across many metazoan taxa, yet the type and extent to which multiple cellular mechanisms come into play can differ across species. For example, urodele amphibians can completely regenerate all lost tissues, including skeletal muscles after limb amputation. This remarkable ability of urodeles to restore entire limbs has been largely linked to a dedifferentiation-dependent mechanism of regeneration. However, whether cell dedifferentiation is the fundamental factor that triggers a robust regeneration capacity, and whether the loss or inhibition of this process explains the limited regeneration potential in other vertebrates is not known. Here, we studied the cellular mechanisms underlying the repetitive regeneration of myogenic tissues in the electric fish S. macrurus. Our in vivo microinjection studies of high molecular weight cell lineage tracers into single identified adult myogenic cells (muscle or noncontractile muscle-derived electrocytes) revealed no fragmentation or cellularization proximal to the amputation plane. In contrast, ultrastructural and immunolabeling studies verified the presence of myogenic stem cells that express the satellite cell marker Pax7 in mature muscle fibers and electrocytes of S. macrurus. These data provide the first example of Pax-7 positive muscle stem cells localized within a non-contractile electrogenic tissue. Moreover, upon amputation, Pax-7 positive cells underwent a robust replication and were detected exclusively in regions that give rise to myogenic cells and dorsal spinal cord components revealing a regeneration process in S. macrurus that is dependent on the activation of myogenic stem cells for the renewal of both skeletal muscle and the muscle-derived electric organ. These data are consistent with the emergent concept in vertebrate regeneration that different tissues provide a distinct progenitor cell population to the regeneration blastema, and these progenitor cells subsequently restore the original tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1971598359,"Despite not knowing the exact age of individuals, humans can estimate their rough age using age-related physical features. Nonhuman primates show some age-related physical features; however, the cognitive traits underlying their recognition of age class have not been revealed. Here, we tested the ability of two species of Old World monkey, Japanese macaques (JM) and Campbell's monkeys (CM), to spontaneously discriminate age classes using visual paired comparison (VPC) tasks based on the two distinct categories of infant and adult images. First, VPCs were conducted in JM subjects using conspecific JM stimuli. When analyzing the side of the first look, JM subjects significantly looked more often at novel images. Based on analyses of total looking durations, JM subjects looked at a novel infant image longer than they looked at a familiar adult image, suggesting the ability to spontaneously discriminate between the two age classes and a preference for infant over adult images. Next, VPCs were tested in CM subjects using heterospecific JM stimuli. CM subjects showed no difference in the side of their first look, but looked at infant JM images longer than they looked at adult images; the fact that CMs were totally naïve to JMs suggested that the attractiveness of infant images transcends species differences. This is the first report of visual age class recognition and a preference for infant over adult images in nonhuman primates. Our results suggest not only species-specific processing for age class recognition but also the evolutionary origins of the instinctive human perception of baby cuteness schema, proposed by the ethologist Konrad Lorenz."

Here we reveal a novel function of TRAF2 in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathway. Knockdown of TRAF2 blocked EGF-induced AP-1 activity and anchorage- independent cell transformation. Notably, we showed that EGF induces ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) ubiquitination, and knocking down TRAF2 suppresses ubiquitination of RSK2 induced by EGF. We also found that TRAF2 affects RSK2 activity through RSK2 ubiquitination. RSK2 plays a critical role in AP-1 activity mediated through CREB and c-Fos, which regulates anchorage-independent cell transformation. In addition, TRAF2 is overexpressed in colon cancer and required for colon cancer development, suggesting that TRAF2 might be a potential molecular target for cancer prevention and treatment."

Conclusion: Constitutive nuclear localization of Pmk1 is important to modulate its overall biological activity. Significance: These results highlight the relevance of the spatial control of MAPK activity. Signal transduction pathways include interconnected molecular networks to process and transmit information about the external surroundings. Evidence has been accumulated about the key role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in the response of eukaryotic cells to stress conditions (1.Kim E.K. Choi E.J. Pathological roles of MAPK signaling pathways in human diseases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1802: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar). The canonical MAPK module comprises three basic components, MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK), MAPK kinase, and MAPK, which are regulated by a sequential cascade of phosphorylation events. Once MAPKs are phosphorylated by a MAPK kinase at threonine and tyrosine residues in the sequence T-X-Y (X = glutamic acid or glycine) within the activation loop, MAPKs directly phosphorylate a wide variety of cytoplasmic substrates or may shift into the nucleus to activate specific transcription factors involved in the transcriptional program required to respond to the environmental stimuli as well as cell cycle regulatory proteins (2.Qi M. Elion E.A. MAP kinase pathways.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The rod-shaped, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has emerged as an excellent model organism to study mechanisms and cellular events linked to MAPK activation. This yeast only has three MAPK pathways: the pheromone signaling pathway (3.Krisak L. Strich R. Winters R.S. Hall J.P. Mallory M.J. Kreitzer D. Tuan R.S. Winter E.

The strong sensitivity to the above stresses displayed by S. pombe mutants lacking Pmk1 indicates that the MAPK function is required for cell adaptation and survival under such conditions. The phosphorylation of Pmk1 also oscillates along the cell cycle and peaks during cytokinesis, suggesting the existence of a specific signal that activates the cell integrity pathway and regulates septum formation and dissolution (11.Madrid M.

The major negative regulator of Pmk1 activity in growing cells of S. pombe is dual specificity phosphatase Pmp1 (15.Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M.

However, it has been additionally shown that tyrosine phosphatases Pyp1 and Pyp2 and serine/threonine phosphatases Ptc1 and Ptc3, whose transcriptional induction is dependent on the SAPK pathway via Sty1-Atf1, are also able to associate in vivo and dephosphorylate activated Pmk1 (11.Madrid M.

Although Pmp1, Pyp1, and Ptc1 control the Pmk1 basal activity level, phosphatases Pyp1, Pyp2, and Ptc1 limit Pmk1 hyperactivation during adaptation to osmostress (11.Madrid M. Núñez A. Soto T. Vicente-Soler J. Gacto M. Cansado J. Stress-activated protein kinase-mediated down-regulation of the cell integrity pathway mitogen-activated protein kinase Pmk1p by protein phosphatases.Mol. Biol.

Nuclear translocation appears crucial for the proper stimulus-dependent functioning of MAPKs in the regulation of distinct cellular processes (2.Qi M. Elion E.A. MAP kinase pathways.J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3569-3572Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mkh1 and Pek1 are cytoplasmic proteins that also locate at the septum area, and Pmk1 is constitutively localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus as well as in the mitotic spindle and septum during cytokinesis (10.Madrid M. Soto T. Khong H.K. Franco A. Vicente J. Pérez P. Gacto M. Cansado J. Stress-induced response, localization, and regulation of the Pmk1 cell integrity pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2033-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It is important to highlight that Pmk1 nucleo/cytoplasmic shuffling appears unaffected by its phosphorylation status in response to environmental stimuli (10.Madrid M. Soto T. Khong H.K. Franco A. Vicente J. Pérez P. Gacto M. Cansado J. Stress-induced response, localization, and regulation of the Pmk1 cell integrity pathway in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.J. Biol.

These observations suggest that both active and inactive forms of the Pmk1 kinase cross the nuclear membrane, thus raising questions about the biological relevance of its nuclear localization. In this work we have addressed this issue by obtaining a fission yeast mutant expressing a Pmk1 version excluded from the cell nucleus and located to the plasma membrane. Such a system provides an ideal tool to study the biological significance of nuclear exclusion of a MAPK. Complete characterization of this mutant has revealed the existence of an exquisite regulatory mechanism controlling proper spatial/temporal activity of this important class of regulatory kinases.

The rho2+, pck2+, atf1+, and mbx1+ null mutants were obtained by entire deletion of the corresponding coding sequences and their replacement with the KanMX6 cassette by PCR-mediated strategy using plasmid pFA6a-kanMX6 as template (18.Bähler J.

Integrative plasmid pIL-pmk1:GFP contains regulatory sequences plus pmk1+ ORF fused at its 3′ end to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (10.Madrid M. Soto T. Khong H.K. Franco A. Vicente J. Pérez P.

To construct plasmid pIL-pmk1:GFP:CAAX, pmk1+ ORF plus regulatory sequences were amplified by PCR using pIL-pmk1:GFP as template employing the 5′-oligonucleotide PMKGF-5 (CCTTATCTAGATTTCTCATTGCCGCTTCTG, which hybridizes at positions 313–330 upstream of the pmk1+ ATG start codon and contains a XbaI site) and the 3′-oligonucleotide GFPCAAX-3 (CCTTACCCGGGTTATGAAATGATGCAGCATTTTGTAGAACTTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC), which hybridizes at the 3′ end of gfp+ ORF and incorporates a 27-nucleotide sequence (underlined) encoding the 9 terminal amino acids of Rho2 GTPase that includes a farnesylated cysteine residue (sequence SSTKCCIIS) (19.Ma Y. Kuno T. Kita A. Asayama Y. Sugiura R. Rho2 is a target of the farnesyltransferase Cpp1 and acts upstream of Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in fission yeast.Mol. Biol.

The resulting PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and SmaI and cloned into the integrative plasmid pIL-GFP. Integrative plasmid pIL-pmk1:GFP:RitC was constructed by the overlap extension method with the use of PCR. First, pmk1+ ORF plus regulatory sequences was amplified by PCR using pIL-pmk1:GFP as the template employing the 5′-oligonucleotide PMKGF-5 and the 3′-oligonucleotide GFPRit-3 (AAAAAAGGGACAGCTTTTGTATAGTTCATC), which hybridizes at the 3′ end of gfp+ ORF and incorporates a 15-nucleotide sequence (underlined) corresponding to the 5 initial amino acids of the C-terminal membrane binding domain of non-CAAX GTPase Rit1. Then, a 192-bp DNA fragment encoding the C-terminal membrane binding domain from Rit1 (63-amino acid length) was amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide GFPRit-5 (GATGAACTATACAAAAGCTGTCCCTTTTTT; complementary to GFPRit-3) and the 3′ oligonucleotide RitS-3 (TCTTACCCGGGTTAAGTTACTGAATCTTTC), which hybridizes at the 3′ end of Rit ORF and is followed by a SmaI site, and employing a human Rit1 cDNA plasmid construct (IMAGE ID 125864, obtained from Source BioScience) as template. The two PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, mixed, and subjected to PCR with external primers PMKGF-5 and RitS-3. The final PCR product was then purified, digested with XbaI and SmaI, and cloned into pIL-GFP to obtain pIL-pmk1:GFP:RitC. To construct plasmid pIL-pmk1:NLS:GFP, pmk1+ ORF plus regulatory sequences was amplified by PCR employing the 5′-oligonucleotide PMKGF-5 and the 3′-oligonucleotide SV40LOC-3 (CCTTAGGATCCACTTTGCGTTTTTTTTTAGGGTTATGGCGATTATCATCAG), which hybridizes at the 3′ end of pmk1+ ORF and incorporates a 21-nucleotide sequence (underlined) encoding the nuclear localization signal (NLS, sequence PKKKRKV) of the SV-40 virus placed immediately upstream of the TAA stop codon and followed by a BamHI site. PCR amplification generated a DNA fragment that was cleaved with XbaI and BamHI and cloned into pIL-GFP to construct C-terminal fusions with the GFP tag and containing the S. pombe leu1+ gene as a selectable marker. In all cases the resulting plasmids were digested at the unique NruI site within leu1+, and the linear fragments were transformed into different pmk1Δ genetic backgrounds. Transformants leu1+ were obtained, and the correct integration of the fusions was verified by both PCR and Western blot analysis. The distinct pmk1+ mutants were created by the overlap extension method with the use of PCR. The mutagenic primers were as follows: PMKAF-5 (CTGGTTTTATGGCGGAGTTTGTGGCAA; the nucleotide substitutions are indicated in boldface) and PMKAF-3 (GTTGCCACAAACTCCGCCATAAAACCAG) to obtain the pmk1-T186A Y188F mutant; PMK4A-5 (GCAAATGAGTTAGCCGCTGTCATTTTAGATGAAGTTTTAAACTTCGCTCAGAAAGTCGCACGCCGCTCTCATC) and PMK4A-3 (GATGAGAGCGGCGTGCGACTTTCTGAGCGAAGTTTAAAACTTCATCTAAAATGACAGCGGCTAACTCATTTGC) to obtain the pmk1-R344A/R345A/R355A/R359A/R361A mutant; PMKAPA-5 (ATCAACTTGGCGCACCTGCTGAGGAAACCC) and PMKAPA-3 (GGGTTTCCTCAGCAGGTGCGCCAAGTTGAT) to obtain the pmk1-T247A D249A mutant. In each case the two pairs of PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, mixed, and subjected again to PCR with external primers PMKGF-5 and PMKGF-3 (CCTTAGGATCCTTATGGCGATTATCATC), which hybridizes at the 3′ end of pmk1+ ORF immediately upstream of the TAA stop codon, and followed by a BamHI site. The PCR products were purified, digested with XbaI and BamHI, and cloned into integrative plasmid pIL-GFP to generate pIL-pmk1(T186A/Y188F):GFP, pIL-pmk1(R344A/R345A/R355A/R359A/R361A):GFP, and pIL-pmk1(T247A/D249A):GFP, respectively. Transformants leu1+ were obtained, and the correct integration of the constructs was verified as above. A catalytically inactive version of Pmk1 (K52E mutant) was obtained using the same strategy employing plasmid pIL-pmk1:GFP:CAAX as template and the mutagenic primers PMKKE-5 (GGCTGTAGCCATAGAAAAAATTACGAAT) and PMKKE-3 (ATTCGTAATTTTTTCTATGGCTACAGCC) to obtain plasmid pIL-pmk1(K52E):GFP:CAAX. Experiments to investigate Pmk1 activation under stress were made using log-phase cell cultures (A600 = 0.5) growing at 28 °C in YES and supplemented with any of the following compounds: caspofungin (a kind gift from Merck), magnesium chloride (Sigma), potassium chloride (Sigma), or hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). Hypotonic treatment was achieved by growing cells in YES medium plus 0.8 m sorbitol (Sigma) and subsequent transfer to the same medium without polyol. In glucose deprivation studies, cells were grown in YES medium with 7% glucose to an A600 = 0.7, recovered by filtration, and resuspended in the same medium without glucose but osmotically equilibrated with 3% glycerol (20.Madrid M.

At different times, the cells from 50 ml of culture were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and washed with cold PBS buffer, and the yeast pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for analysis. Cell homogenates were prepared under native conditions employing chilled acid-washed glass beads and lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 plus specific protease and phosphatase inhibitor; Sigma). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP (Cell Signaling) or polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p42/44 antibodies (Cell Signaling). In cell cycle experiments a rabbit anti-Cdc2 antibody (PSTAIRE; Sigma) was used for loading control. The immunoreactive bands were revealed with anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare). Densitometric quantification of Western blot signals was performed using Molecular Analyst Software (Bio-Rad). Cell homogenates were prepared under native conditions as indicated above. The cleared lysates were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-c-myc antibody (clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science). Anti-Cdc2 antibody was used as the loading control. Yeast cells were grown in YES medium to an A600 of 0.8 and subjected to the appropriate stress treatment, and volumes of 50 ml of the cultures were recovered at different times. Total RNA preparations were obtained and resolved through 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gels. Northern (RNA)-hybridization analyses were performed as previously described (21.Núñez A. Franco A. Madrid M.

The probes employed were a 2.1-kbp fragment of the pyp2+ gene amplified by PCR with the 5′ oligonucleotide CCGAGAGCGTTTCTTGGA and the 3′ oligonucleotide AAGGGCTTGGAAGCCTGG and a 1-kbp fragment of the leu1+ gene amplified with the 5′ oligonucleotide TCGTCGTCTTACCAGGAG and the 3′ oligonucleotide CAACAGCCTTAGTAATAT. Ready-To-Go DNA labeling beads (GE Healthcare) was used for DNA labeling. To establish quantitative conclusions, the level of mRNAs was determined in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and compared with the internal control (leu1+ mRNA). Clarified cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation for 1 h at 45,000 rpm in a Optima TL ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) employing a TLA-100.3 rotor. Once the supernatant was removed, the pellet fractions (P1) were resuspended in lysis buffer plus 7 m urea (final concentration), and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation as above to yield supernatant (S2) and particulate/membrane (P2) fractions. Samples of P1, S2, and P2 fractions were resuspended in SDS/PAGE loading buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with anti-GFP antibody. Wild type and mutant strains of S. pombe were grown in YES liquid medium to A600 = 0.6. Appropriate dilutions were spotted per duplicate on YES solid medium or in the same medium supplemented with different concentrations of MgCl2, FK506, or caspofungin. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for 3 days and then photographed. Cell wall resistance to 1,3-β-glucanase was assayed in different mutants as previously described (11.Madrid M. Núñez A. Soto T.

https://openalex.org/W1987669182,"Complex neuronal networks are an important tool to help explain paradoxical phenomena observed in biological recordings. Here we present a general approach to mathematically tackle a complex neuronal network so that we can fully understand the underlying mechanisms. Using a previously developed network model of the milk-ejection reflex in oxytocin cells, we show how we can reduce a complex model with many variables and complex network topologies to a tractable model with two variables, while retaining all key qualitative features of the original model. The approach enables us to uncover how emergent synchronous bursting can arise from a neuronal network which embodies known biological features. Surprisingly, the bursting mechanisms are similar to those found in other systems reported in the literature, and illustrate a generic way to exhibit emergent and multiple time scale oscillations at the membrane potential level and the firing rate level."

Percentage (%) of CCR2 expressing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated using Flow Cytometry. Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to quantitate CCR2 mRNA expression in PBMCs. Normal controls (n = 40) were also included for comparison.Flow Cytometry revealed significantly reduced CCR2 expressing PBMCs in the ALS patients. We also found a significant decline in number of CCR2 expressing PBMCs in limb onset ALS when compared to bulbar onset ALS. PBMCs from ALS patients showed substantial down-regulation of CCR2 mRNA. CCR2 mRNA expression was found to be decreased among limb ALS patients as compared to bulbar onset ALS. Further, the count of CCR2+ PBMCs and CCR2 mRNA transcript in PBMCs was significantly lower in severe and moderate ALS as compared to ALS patients with mild impairments.Downregulation of PBMCs CCR2 may indicate its etio-pathological relevance in ALS pathogenesis. Reduced PBMCs CCR2 may result in decreased infiltration of leukocytes at the site of degeneration as a compensatory response to ALS. CCR2 levels measurements in hematopoietic stem cells and estimation of comparative PBMCs count among ALS, disease controls and normal controls can unveil its direct neuroprotective role. However, the conclusions are restricted by the absence of neurological/non-neurological disease controls in the study."
https://openalex.org/W2074400395,"Follistatin (FST), a folliculogenesis regulating protein, is found in relatively high concentrations in female ovarian tissues. FST acts as an antagonist to Activin, which is often elevated in human ovarian carcinoma, and thus may serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention against ovarian cancer. The breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) is a known tumor suppressor gene in human breast cancer; however its role in ovarian cancer is not well understood. We performed microarray analysis on human ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3 that stably overexpress wild-type BRCA1 and compared with the corresponding empty vector-transfected clones. We found that stable expression of BRCA1 not only stimulates FST secretion but also simultaneously inhibits Activin expression. To determine the physiological importance of this phenomenon, we further investigated the effect of cellular BRCA1 on the FST secretion in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial (IOSE) cells derived from either normal human ovaries or ovaries of an ovarian cancer patient carrying a mutation in BRCA1 gene. Knock-down of BRCA1 in normal IOSE cells demonstrates down-regulation of FST secretion along with the simultaneous up-regulation of Activin expression. Furthermore, knock-down of FST in IOSE cell lines as well as SKOV3 cell line showed significantly reduced cell proliferation and decreased cell migration when compared with the respective controls. Thus, these findings suggest a novel function for BRCA1 as a regulator of FST expression and function in human ovarian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2117790422,"Medication errors are an important source of potentially preventable morbidity and mortality. The PINCER study, a cluster randomised controlled trial, is one of the world's first experimental studies aiming to reduce the risk of such medication related potential for harm in general practice. Bayesian analyses can improve the clinical interpretability of trial findings.Experts were asked to complete a questionnaire to elicit opinions of the likely effectiveness of the intervention for the key outcomes of interest--three important primary care medication errors. These were averaged to generate collective prior distributions, which were then combined with trial data to generate bayesian posterior distributions. The trial data were analysed in two ways: firstly replicating the trial reported cohort analysis acknowledging pairing of observations, but excluding non-paired observations; and secondly as cross-sectional data, with no exclusions, but without acknowledgement of the pairing. Frequentist and bayesian analyses were compared.Bayesian evaluations suggest that the intervention is able to reduce the likelihood of one of the medication errors by about 50 (estimated to be between 20% and 70%). However, for the other two main outcomes considered, the evidence that the intervention is able to reduce the likelihood of prescription errors is less conclusive.Clinicians are interested in what trial results mean to them, as opposed to what trial results suggest for future experiments. This analysis suggests that the PINCER intervention is strongly effective in reducing the likelihood of one of the important errors; not necessarily effective in reducing the other errors. Depending on the clinical importance of the respective errors, careful consideration should be given before implementation, and refinement targeted at the other errors may be something to consider."
https://openalex.org/W1992668639,"The common chameleon, Chamaeleo chameleon, is an arboreal lizard with highly independent, large-amplitude eye movements. In response to a moving threat, a chameleon on a perch responds with distinct avoidance movements that are expressed in its continuous positioning on the side of the perch distal to the threat. We analyzed body-exposure patterns during threat avoidance for evidence of lateralization, that is, asymmetry at the functional/behavioral levels. Chameleons were exposed to a threat approaching horizontally from the left or right, as they held onto a vertical pole that was either wider or narrower than the width of their head, providing, respectively, monocular or binocular viewing of the threat. We found two equal-sized sub-groups, each displaying lateralization of motor responses to a given direction of stimulus approach. Such an anti-symmetrical distribution of lateralization in a population may be indicative of situations in which organisms are regularly exposed to crucial stimuli from all spatial directions. This is because a bimodal distribution of responses to threat in a natural population will reduce the spatial advantage of predators."
https://openalex.org/W2088082316,"Spinal ligaments, such as the ligamentum flavum (LF), are prone to degeneration and iatrogenic injury that can lead to back pain and nerve dysfunction. Repair and regeneration strategies for these tissues are lacking, perhaps due to limited understanding of spinal ligament formation, the elaboration of its elastic fibers, maturation and homeostasis. Using immunohistochemistry and histology, we investigated murine LF elastogenesis and tissue formation from embryonic to mature postnatal stages. We characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of the key elastogenic proteins tropoelastin, fibrillin-1, fibulin-4 and lysyl oxidase. We found that elastogenesis begins in utero with the microfibril constituent fibrillin-1 staining intensely just before birth. Elastic fibers were first detected histologically at postnatal day (P) 7, the earliest stage at which tropoelastin and fibulin-4 stained intensely. From P7 to P28, elastic fibers grew in diameter and became straighter along the axis. The growth of elastic fibers coincided with intense staining of tropoelastin and fibulin-4 staining, possibly supporting a chaperone role for fibulin-4. These expression patterns correlated with reported skeletal and behavioral changes during murine development. This immunohistochemical characterization of elastogenesis of the LF will be useful for future studies investigating mechanisms for elastogenesis and developing new strategies for treatment or regeneration of spinal ligaments and other highly elastic tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2113589274,"Monitoring of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection may prevent disease. We tested an ESAT-6 and CFP-10-specific IFN-γ Elispot assay (RD1-Elispot) on 163 HIV-infected individuals living in a TB-endemic setting. An RD1-Elispot was performed every 3 months for a period of 3–21 months. 62% of RD1-Elispot negative individuals were positive by cultured Elispot. Fluctuations in T cell response were observed with rates of change ranging from −150 to +153 spot-forming cells (SFC)/200,000 PBMC in a 3-month period. To validate these responses we used an RD1-specific real time quantitative PCR assay for monokine-induced by IFN-γ (MIG) and IFN-γ inducible protein-10 (IP10) (MIG: r = 0.6527, p = 0.0114; IP-10: r = 0.6967, p = 0.0056; IP-10+MIG: r = 0.7055, p = 0.0048). During follow-up 30 individuals were placed on ARVs and 4 progressed to active TB. Fluctuations in SFC did not correlate with CD4 count, viral load, treatment initiation, or progression to active TB. The RD1-Elispot appears to have limited value in this setting."
https://openalex.org/W2125074507,"Among gene families it is the Hox genes and among metazoan animals it is the insects (Hexapoda) that have attracted particular attention for studying the evolution of development. Surprisingly though, no Hox genes have been isolated from 26 out of 35 insect orders yet, and the existing sequences derive mainly from only two orders (61% from Hymenoptera and 22% from Diptera). We have designed insect specific primers and isolated 37 new partial homeobox sequences of Hox cluster genes (lab, pb, Hox3, ftz, Antp, Scr, abd-a, Abd-B, Dfd, and Ubx) from six insect orders, which are crucial to insect phylogenetics. These new gene sequences provide a first step towards comparative Hox gene studies in insects. Furthermore, comparative distance analyses of homeobox sequences reveal a correlation between gene divergence rate and species radiation success with insects showing the highest rate of homeobox sequence evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1988317727,"We previously identified via a genome wide association study variants near LEKR and CCNL1 and in the ADCY5 genes lead to lower birthweight. Here, we study the impact of these variants and social stress during pregnancy, defined as social adversity and neighborhood disparity, on infant birth size. We aimed to determine whether the addition of genetic variance magnified the observed associations.We analyzed data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (n=5369). Social adversity was defined by young maternal age (<20 years), low maternal education (<11 years), and/or single marital status. Neighborhood social disparity was assessed by discrepancy between neighborhoods relative to personal socio-economic status. These variables are indicative of social and socioeconomic stress, but also of biological risk. The adjusted multiple regression analysis showed smaller birth size in both infants of mothers who experienced social adversity (birthweight by -40.4 g, 95%CI -61.4, -19.5; birth length -0.14 cm, 95%CI -0.23, -0.05; head circumference -0.09 cm 95%CI -0.15, -0.02) and neighborhood disparity (birthweight -28.8 g, 95%CI -47.7, -10.0; birth length -0.12 cm, 95%CI -0.20, -0.05). The birthweight-lowering risk allele (SNP rs900400 near LEKR and CCNL1) magnified this association in an additive manner. However, likely due to sample size restriction, this association was not significant for the SNP rs9883204 in ADCY5. Birth size difference due to social stress was greater in the presence of birthweight-lowering alleles.Social adversity, neighborhood disparity, and genetic variants have independent associations with infant birth size in the mutually adjusted analyses. If the newborn carried a risk allele rs900400 near LEKR/CCNL1, the impact of stress on birth size was stronger. These observations give support to the hypothesis that individuals with genetic or other biological risk are more vulnerable to environmental influences. Our study indicates the need for further research to understand the mechanisms by which genes impact individual vulnerability to environmental insults."
https://openalex.org/W2049713399,"We describe a novel in vitro cloning strategy that combines standard tools in molecular biology with a basic protecting group concept to create a versatile framework for the rapid and seamless assembly of modular DNA building blocks into functional open reading frames. Analogous to chemical synthesis strategies, our assembly design yields idempotent composite synthons amenable to iterative and recursive split-and-pool reaction cycles. As an example, we illustrate the simplicity, versatility and efficiency of the approach by constructing an open reading frame composed of tandem arrays of a human fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain and the von Willebrand Factor A2 domain (VWFA2), as well as chimeric (FNIII)(n)-VWFA2-(FNIII)(n) constructs. Although we primarily designed this strategy to accelerate assembly of repetitive constructs for single-molecule force spectroscopy, we anticipate that this approach is equally applicable to the reconstitution and modification of complex modular sequences including structural and functional analysis of multi-domain proteins, synthetic biology or the modular construction of episomal vectors."
